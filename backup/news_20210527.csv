42386886,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVi41,1622157600,Ark’s Cathie Wood Blames Crypto Crash on ‘ESG Movement’,"Elon Musk and the “ESG movement” are responsible for the recent drop in cryptocurrency prices, an influential fund manager told CoinDesk’s Consensus 2021 conference today.      Cathie Wood, the founder of Ark Investment Management, said bitcoin – which has lost up to 50% of its value in the last few weeks – has come under pressure from institutional investors concerned about its environmental profile.      “It was precipitated by the ESG [environmental, social and governance] movement and this notion, which was exacerbated by Elon Musk, that there are some real environmental problems with the mining of bitcoin. A lot of institutional buying went on pause,” she told Nathaniel Whittemore in a pre-recorded interview broadcast Thursday.      Musk, who had buoyed markets by saying Tesla would buy bitcoin for its treasury and accept it as payment for its cars, reversed course on the latter, sending prices downwards.      “Elon probably got a few calls from institutions,” Wood said. “I noticed that BlackRock is [Tesla]’s number three shareholder and Larry Fink is the CEO. He is focused on ESG and especially on climate change. I'm sure BlackRock registered some complaints and perhaps there are some very large holders in Europe who are extremely sensitive to this.”    Read more: Cathie Wood: Ahead of the Curve (Most Influential profile)    Wood, a storied innovation investor, remains confident in the future of Bitcoin, which she described as the first rules-based “global monetary system in the world.” Recently, speaking to Bloomberg, she forecast the cryptocurrency will go to $500,000.      In her Consensus appearance Thursday, she predicted central banks will begin buying crypto assets for their balance sheets and that Musk will prove positive for bitcoin in the long term, improving its environmental profile.      “He has encouraged a lot more conversation, a lot more analytical thinking. And I do believe he's going to become a part of the process,” she said.    Deflationary environment    Prominent figures like Lawrence Summers and Ray Dalio have recently warned that government and central bank spending could push up inflation this year. But Wood, who is known for bucking conventional wisdom, said deflation is more likely. She predicted a “significant” fall in commodity prices and that technology like artificial intelligence and blockchain will serve to hold down business costs.      “As time goes on here, we are thinking that the much higher probability is deflation. I know most people think that's crazy, given what's going on. But we have seen a crack in some commodity prices already,” she said.      That, in turn, could lead some policymakers in emerging markets, or even the eurozone, to adopt hard money, including bitcoin.      “In emerging markets, if commodity prices come down, a lot of them are linked to commodity prices [and] their currencies will come under pressure,” she said. “I wouldn't be surprised if some of these emerging market central banks start accumulating bitcoin … because they know their currencies are going down, and that they will be under attack as reserves go down.”      In his own appearance at Consensus this week, Dalio said bitcoin could become a victim of its own success: that governments will try to ban it as it becomes a competitive threat. But Wood said governments have learned that innovation is key to long-term growth and that technology, be it cryptocurrency and the internet before it, can’t really be stopped.    Read more: Cathie Wood: Secrets of the World’s Best Innovation Investor    “They're all trying to say, ‘Let's have a better regulatory footprint here so that we attract more innovation.’ And I think that is going to happen with, or already is happening with, cryptocurrencies,” she said.      Wood said she was “very happy” to see Gary Gensler, who is known to be open-minded toward cryptocurrency, installed as the new head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, alongside Valerie A. Szczepanik, who leads the body’s Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology.      Wood said bitcoin has proved itself as a store of value and a way to protect against wealth confiscation. She said it had the potential to be a settlement network following the introduction of layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network. But Ark is increasingly focused on ethereum, having invested in Grayscale's Ethereum Trust and hired an Ethereum miner to its fintech analysis team. (Grayscale is a unit of Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.)  “We're intrigued by stablecoins and [decentralized finance], of course, and [non-fungible tokens]. And we're also very interested that developers are migrating very, very quickly [to Ethereum]. I always say to our analysts, ‘Follow the developers, let's see what they're doing.’ Because that's a very loud signal,” Wood told Whittemore.      As for Musk, Wood said he would help bitcoin miners to ""green"" their operations. “This auditing of what miners, certainly in North America, are willing to do around how much of their electricity usage is generated by renewables is going to bring that topic into stark relief. It will encourage an acceleration in the adoption of renewables beyond which otherwise would have taken the place.”      As described in a recent Square-Ark white paper, mining and renewables can grow in tandem, with bitcoin acting as a “battery” to soak up excess electricity produced from intermittent sources like solar and wind, Wood said. In effect, mining can help fund renewables and make solar more attractive to innovation investors including Ark.      Previously the firm didn’t see the potential to make big returns from solar and wind, but now that might change. “I'm actually quite excited about it,” she said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | MINING,Benjamin Schiller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/27/arks-cathie-wood-blames-crypto-crash-on-esg-movement,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4050c56a3317ad8d37c5458816530675b683faee-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42386896,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBViFL,1622156717,The Node: Regulating Intermediaries in a DeFi World,"Crypto is a spilled can of worms for regulators that should have been squished a decade ago. That was the message Jason Furman, a senior economist in the Obama administration, told the Washington Post this week. It’s now a “$2 trillion monster,” he said.      The pace of innovation in crypto is difficult for regulators to keep up with, especially considering that, until now, there hasn’t been a proactive, cohesive, industry-wide attempt to manage the industry. Despite operating under a hodgepodge of rules, frameworks and recommendations, crypto has ballooned. And regulatory attention with it.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    “The existing framework is simply inapplicable to a system predicated on the absence of intermediaries,” Director of the Blockchain Association Kristin Smith said in an interview following her Consensus 2021 appearance. This is an important point: Decentralized tools exist as the antithesis of a financial system where trusted custodians are needed to manage one’s money.      There’s a strong argument that the technological advances in crypto fulfill the basic consumer, fraud and terrorist financing protections the old system was erected to perform.      Current regulations are designed to regulate intermediaries, Marc Boiron, general counsel for DyDx, said during a Consensus panel. When there is no intermediary to custody your assets, make trades on your behalf or manage your personal information, there’s no point, Boiron asked. “The faults of the old system” aren’t present in non-custodial, open information DeFi systems.      But it seems regulators have had a difficult time coming around to that view.    Read more: Rebecca Rettig - DeFi Is Not TradFi: Why FATF’s Guidance Would Stifle Growth    Smith said regulators are working overtime to try to fill the gaps and integrate novel financial and technological products under existing rules.      For instance, in the waning days of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Trump administration’s Treasury Department floated rules that would extend surveillance over certain transactions and “unhosted” (or non-custodial) wallets. The new head of the agency, Michael Mosier, who joined the public sector from crypto-analytics firm Chainalysis, said, “Nothing’s been decided” there.      Likewise, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler said earlier this month that Congress ought to clarify cryptocurrency rules, without giving any specifics. The Treasury Department asked cryptocurrency companies to provide the Internal Revenue Service with more financial information.      Separately, FinCEN wants to better understand how privacy tools like zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) and homomorphic encryption – popular among certain cryptocurrency protocols – work in fintechs, regtechs, venture capital firms and financial institutions.      In most of these examples, the respective agencies have opened a line of dialogue to industry participants. But it’s not always easy to know what the right course of action is, even for insiders.      In a Consensus panel this morning, some of the top legal minds in decentralized finance (DeFi) discussed whether open systems should or should not be regulated under existing rules. They called it the “new wine in an old wineskin problem.”      These lawyers often don’t know when or how an existing rule applies to the protocols they represent. Aave general counsel Rebecca Rettig didn’t have a clear answer, but said when confronted with a difficult puzzle she tries to think through what the rules were set up to accomplish.      Is a rule designed for consumer protections? To eliminate information asymmetries? To mitigate risks? Often, she’s found, the rules are made obsolete by the architecture of open protocols. Still, she always asks, what are the decisions you can make to show you care about compliance?      Compound’s Jake Chervinksy agreed. Just try to be one of the “good guys,” he said. None of the legal scholars recommended that watchdog policies be dismantled, but Chervinsky did note that particular policies could benefit from “disintermediation” in different ways. That is, self-regulating crypto protocols could benefit securities laws in different ways than commodities law.      To comply with rules designed to regulate intermediaries, DeFi “protocols would need to insert a code or human process to intermediate transactions,” Boiron said. None of the panelists think “re-centralization” is a good idea.      Under the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) expanded travel rules recommendation, developers may end up responsible for malfeasance on the system, even if they do a Satoshi and walk away from what they build.    Read more: Five Years In, DeFi Now Defines Ethereum    Still, Boiron is level-headed. For as decentralized, well-intentioned or automated as many DeFi protocols are, there could be bad actors.      “[T]he developer of the protocol or any third-party developer around the protocol could lie about the protocol, leading people to believe things that are not true about the protocol. That is where consumer protection would make sense,” he said.      But to apply traditional consumer protections to a protocol is still misguided.      “Regulators and industry should work together to devise a new regulatory paradigm that leverages the many advantages inherent to decentralized finance in order to vindicate the core objectives that traditional regulatory frameworks seek to accomplish,” Blockchain Association’s Smith said.      Despite the uncertainty, there’s pressure to get this right. Consumers can get hurt. Terrorists might get financed. And industries might crumble.      “The existing framework will have to bend to fit new tech. If it does not bend, then development will move outside the U.S. Once protocols are created and released, especially without admin keys, there is no stopping them,” Boiron added over email following his Consensus appearance.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/05/27/the-node-regulating-intermediaries-in-a-defi-world,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/22355ae31a0e0d02d3d1649fd44f0b080c33e73b-1400x788.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Cryptocurrencies are not here to kill traditional finance or government-backed fiat currencies, but to provide more “freedom of money.”      Cryptocurrency is “just a new tool that can increase the freedom of money all around the world,” Zhao told CoinDesk adviser Nolan Bauerle. “I don’t view them as competing with regulators ... and there is a way for us to work together.”    Read more: Mayhem in Binance Leveraged Tokens During Crypto Crash Leaves Traders Fuming    Zhao’s claim comes as Binance, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, faces increased regulatory scrutiny. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are facing their own regulatory hurdles after becoming more popular than ever.      It’s not just regulators in the U.S; government entities around the world have raised questions about the business operations of Binance, a company that claims it has no headquarters in a specific country or region.      Zhao said his company does not intend to fight against any governments or countries, adding the doubts about how Binance operates are likely due to a lack of regulatory clarity.      “We are not going against governments,” Zhao said. “There are times where the regulators or rules are not super clear. They are still being established in most parts of the world so there are some gray areas. But [we've] just got to experiment and work together and figure that out.”    The Binance way    Zhao does not appear to have a clear strategy for his company, even though Binance is highly involved in almost every trendy crypto innovation, whether it is decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or tokenized real-world assets.      “I'm not smart enough to predict what's gonna happen, which one's gonna be hot, which one users [are] gonna adopt,” Zhao said. “The way Binance is organized is that we just have lots of experiments.      Zhao said he has been trying to make fewer “top-down” decisions, especially when it comes to what he called “big” projects such as Binance Smart Chain (BSC), a public blockchain gaining steam as one of the more competitive rivals to the Ethereum blockchain.      “Binance Smart Chain came out of nowhere,” Zhao said. “It wasn’t my idea.”      His clarification seems to be a response to an increasing number of hacks or exploits recently on DeFi protocols built on BSC including some of the biggest monetary exploits in DeFi history. With BSC’s name associated with Binance directly, many have criticized Zhao and demanded he and Binance take responsibility for the exploits.    Read more: Binance Says ‘Rollback’ Not Possible After DeFi Exploits on Binance Smart Chain    “Binance Smart Chain is an independent blockchain, [and] we don't have control over it,” Zhao said. “The projects on there are running very independently. If I talk to them, they will talk to me. But I don’t talk to them at all.”      Zhao did, however, say he and his company benefit from BSC’s success because Binance coin (BNB) is the native crypto supporting BSC. Both Zhao and Binance remain large holders of BNB.      Unlike Ethereum, BSC runs on a Proof-Of-Staked-Authority (PoSA) consensus mechanism, which is controlled by 21 node operators that are elected by BNB holders. Some analysts have speculated that BSC’s validators could be in some way connected or tied to Binance.      Zhao has previously said that BSC had to sacrifice the decentralization element for scalability, which has been a problem for Ethereum.",POSITIVE,BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | BNB,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/27/no-one-can-shut-down-bitcoin-says-binance-ceo-cz,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f41a1a9aebee7be5d155c796628aa2ffc4358fc5-1300x929.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386898,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBViBZ,1622155082,Compliance Exec: Crypto Too Slow to Adopt Anti-Laundering Rules Ahead of FATF Review,"The world’s governments are about to get a report card on their progress combating financial crime in the cryptocurrency arena, and at least one compliance executive expects a poor grade.      Next month the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental body that sets standards for anti-money laundering (AML) measures, will meet for its triannual plenary. On the agenda is assessing how far the FATF’s 39 members (37 jurisdictions and two regional organizations) have come in adopting its recommendations for policing crypto – including the controversial “travel rule” requiring businesses to share customer information. A final guidance document is expected shortly afterwards.      Speaking Thursday at Consensus 2021, Malcolm Wright, the advisory council chair at trade group Global Digital Finance, sounded pessimistic about the impending review.      “One could perhaps conclude that there’s not enough progress on licencing, that the industry is still not progressing fast enough to respond to compliance and particularly the travel rule,” said Wright, who stressed his view was coming from outside FATF’s consultation process and that it was also partly his opinion.      “And there's not enough coordinated regulatory frameworks. That is, at the moment, each country is kind of doing its own thing, which makes compliance actually very difficult for us,” said Wright, whose day job is as chief compliance officer at 100x Group, the operator of crypto derivatives exchange BitMex.      If he is correct, the FATF may start to publicly call out jurisdictions it deems to be lagging behind when it comes to crypto and where regulatory arbitrage, or exploitation of loopholes, may be taking place. That could prompt regulators and law enforcement, especially in the U.S., to take a tougher stance toward crypto exchanges and other service providers in far-flung jurisdictions that do business with Americans.      It’s not been easy grafting AML strictures from the traditional financial world onto the pseudonymous-by-design cryptocurrency space. So far, the FATF recommendations have spawned a range of technical solutions, to some extent creating problems when these new systems don’t work in conjunction with each other.    DeFi dragnet    Concerning areas of unevenness in the FATF guidance given thus far, Wright pointed to the emerging area of decentralized finance (DeFi), where strangers on the internet can lend each other money and charge ample fees.      The original capture of DeFi in the eyes of the FATF, which happened in 2019, involved the owner or operator of a decentralized application used to exchange value, fiat or virtual currency being classed as a virtual asset service provider (VASP) and so falling within regulations. But this was later widened to include any provider that may develop or operate a DeFi platform, even if they have no interaction with users or collect no fees.      “So that would be unlikely to facilitate money laundering or even to have any means to interrogate data, or to report to authorities,” said Wright, who joined 100x last year as its first-ever compliance chief after BitMex ran afoul of U.S. authorities.      This is further complicated by FATF’s core concept of having a level playing field towards regulation, Wright added, since centralized crypto finance (CeFi) and DeFi are constructed and operate so differently from one another.      “To attempt to regulate on the basis of functional equivalency alone – for example, a CeFi and DeFi exchange both conduct token exchange – that will be troublesome,” Wright said. “The unintended consequence of the current drafting could be to end up regulating far more parties than necessary to meet their [FATF’s] AML objectives.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | ZRX,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/05/27/compliance-exec-crypto-too-slow-to-adopt-anti-laundering-rules-ahead-of-fatf-review,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9ccb9c1d9aee5abd94fd928d4021ee78e8603162-1200x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

WisdomTree Ethereum Trust would list on the Cboe BZX Exchange under a to-be-determined ticker symbol. It does not yet have a crypto custodian lined up, the form shows.

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $38,814 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 0.75% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $37,317-$40,372 (CoinDesk 20)  Ether (ETH) trading around $2,756 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). In the green 0.60% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether’s 24-hour range: $2,888-$2,650 (CoinDesk 20)  Bitcoin volatility dips    Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Thursday by at 0.75% as of press time. BTC was below the 10-hour moving average and the 50-hour, a bearish signal for market technicians.      BTC rose from $37,317 at 03:15 UTC (11:15 p.m. ET Wednesday) to as high as $40,372 by 13:30 UTC Thursday (9:30 a.m. ET Wednesday), an 8.1% increase based on CoinDesk 20 data. Bitcoin has since fallen somewhat, however, settling at $38,814 as of press time.      One possible explanation for the rise: PayPal executive Jose Fernandez da Ponte saying during a Wednesday Consensus 2021 panel that the payments firm will allow its crypto users to move balances to different wallets. This could be a way for retail traders to get into crypto by using PayPal’s existing banking rails, and then push increased liquidity into venues like exchanges.      Henrik Kugelberg, a crypto over-the-counter trader, told CoinDesk he has been seeing increased bitcoin buying as of late. He thinks bitcoin’s gold-like store-of-value properties in uncertain times will prompt many people to continue to scoop up BTC.      “There is a veritable rush for gold, no question about it,” said Kugelberg. “However, the big players in bitcoin are also very active in buying.”    BTC volatility drops    Bitcoin’s 30-day volatility has been dropping the past two days, down to 88.4%. Gold’s volatility has been dipping, too, at 12.2%, according to CoinDesk Research data.      “The macro perspective has not changed,” added Kugelberg. The U.S. dollar's ""buying power is diminishing and reserves are being exchanged for gold and bitcoin.”      Read More: Billionaire Carl Icahn Eyes Potential $1.5B Crypto Investment    Lots of bitcoin puts at $40K    After the $50,000 strike price, where there’s 16,000 BTC in open interest in the options market, the $40,000 strike is the next popular spot for options traders, according to data from Skew. While that might seem bearish at first look, George Clayton, partner at investment firm Cryptanalysis Capital, thinks this orientation is more about hedging.      “It’s impossible to ascertain if traders are oriented short from $40,000,” Clayton said. “That open interest could mean they are long BTC and buying protection, or are delta hedged and simply long volatility, just as much as it could mean they are bearish.”      Crypto’s roller coaster-type price changes are why smart derivatives traders are holding options at $40,000 and not necessarily a bear-mode mentality, said Nathan Cox, chief investment officer at digital asset firm Two Prime.      “Because traders and investors are still spooked by recent volatility, they will likely continue to favor downside protection,” Cox said. “Recency bias tells them they need to manage downside risk.”    Ether open interest still popping    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether, was trading around $2,756 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), gaining 0.60% over the prior 24 hours. The asset is below the 10-hour moving average and the above the 50-hour, a sideways signal for market technicians.      Ether slid from $2,888 at 00:15 UTC (8:15 p.m. ET Wednesday) to $2,650 at 03:45 UTC Wednesday (11:45 p.m. ET Wednesday), an 8.2% fall based on CoinDesk 20 data. ETH has since gained, settling at $2,756 as of press time.      After a precipitous drop from an all-time high of $598.4 million in ether futures open interest (OI) on CME, that market has steadily increased this week. Climbing from a $366 million valley on Sunday, OI has peaked to $522 million Wednesday, a 42% gain on a venue known for institutional hedging.    Ether might be winning the 'green' bet    Vishal Shah, founder of crypto derivatives exchange Alpha5, thinks the problematic environmental and social governance (ESG) factors around bitcoin mining may be creating a narrative that ether might be ""greener,"" prompting the rise in ether futures.      “I think the ideological narrative is shifting a bit more in favor of ETH and Ethereum’s leadership has also been vocal about it,” Shah said. “Though ESG is a scapegoat, it may be enough of a buzzword to cause at least a temporary shift in sticky capital allocations.”      It’s important to note that Ethereum also uses proof-of-work mining, at least until the shift to ETH 2.0 occurs.      “For bitcoin, there's a tug-of-war at the moment between crypto natives and the mainstream regarding extreme energy consumption,” said Brian Mosoff, chief executive officer of Ether Capital. “Whether this is right or wrong, it's left a lot of investors hitting the brakes on going all in on bitcoin and instead turning to alternatives like ether.”    Ether spot volume higher than bitcoin once again    On Wednesday, the latest day for closing metrics from CoinDesk Research, ETH spot volumes again beat bitcoin based on major exchange data. Ether’s volumes were at $52.3 billion Wednesday, while the amount of BTC changing hands tallied $45.4 billion.      The potential of decentralized finance, or DeFi, is one factor causing increased trading of ether, noted Misha Alefirenko, co-found of crypto market maker VelvetFormula.      “The main heat right now is in DeFi,” said Alefirenko. “So blockchains that support smart contracts are having stronger ‘use case’ propositions.”      Over the past month, ether’s spot trading volume has been higher than bitcoin’s eight times, with four of those days occurring in the past week.      “Ethereum has a lot of momentum behind it right at the moment,” added Ether Capital’s Mosoff. “There's a lot to be excited about in this ecosystem.”      Read More: Talos Raises $40M Series A Funding From a16z, PayPal, Fidelity    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed Thursday.

42386892,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVi93,1622144834,Binance.US CEO Brian Brooks: Excluding Crypto Banks From Fed System Is ‘Dangerous’,"Former Acting Comptroller of the Currency and current Binance.US CEO Brian Brooks warned against a tightening regulatory climate in Washington that could be unfavorable to crypto upstarts.      “There has never been a national trust bank that was not accepted as a member of the [Federal Reserve], and so the idea that somehow these trust banks could be excluded just because they're engaged in custodying crypto, that's not only a crazy idea, it's a dangerous idea,” Brooks said.      The statement comes as the Federal Reserve seeks comments on a proposal to grant certain chartered institutions access to its master accounts and speaks to the potential politicization of the crypto economy.      While it seems that entities chartered through regulations like Wyoming's Special Purpose Depository Institution rules could be granted access if the proposal is adopted, it's not clear whether OCC-chartered crypto trust banks will also be allowed access.      Paxos, Protego and Anchorage, the three crypto-native firms to have received conditional charters from the formerly Brooks-led Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), do not currently have access to the Fed’s master accounts, meaning they still need bank partners to settle some transactions.    Read more: Senate Banking Chairman ‘Concerned’ by OCC’s Crypto Charters    While the Fed hasn’t explicitly said it would exclude OCC-chartered banks, Brooks comments show it’s far from a settled matter.      “The idea that a bank that is custodying fine art collections or rare wines gets access to the Fed but a bank that is custodying crypto private keys can't, I mean, somebody explain to me what is the rationale for that other than just rank politics,” Brooks said. “That's a really bad idea when we politicize the banking system.”      He likened the prospect to “deplatforming” on social media.      “You don't want some politically appointed person saying which banks get access to the central bank and which banks don't get access to the central bank,” he said in an interview with CoinDesk’s Nikhilesh De during the Consensus 2021 conference.    A long four weeks    Beyond his assessment of the current situation in Washington, Brooks reiterated key goals for the crypto exchange he’s been at the helm of for a mere four weeks.      “These four weeks would be a year in any other job, I have to say,” he quipped.      Goals include bolstering customer support and focusing on hiring. Binance.US has scaled quickly but has also been hit with a rash of customer complaints.      “On a given day we're trading between $3 and $4 billion of spot market transactions on a platform that didn't exist 24 months ago and only has 100 employees,” Brooks said, “so you can sort of imagine what that looks like.”      This is, in part, why customers are seeing a wide variety of issues, conceded Brooks.    Read more: ‘So Many Locked Out’: Binance Users Say Their Accounts Have Been Frozen for Months    “You will quickly lose hearts and minds if people can't onboard fast enough or if they find themselves deplatformed for a reason that they don't understand or locked out of their account for a period of time,” said Brooks. “I'd be lying if I said we didn't have a real problem in this area.”      To that end, the company has hired a new head of customer support and is “10x-ing the customer support team,” Brooks said.    Tech ‘onshoring’    Another reason for the customer support issues is that Binance.US licenses some of its technology from Binance, meaning the U.S. affiliate doesn't have full control over it.      That means code updates sometimes ship in the middle of the night, with Binance.US learning about them, and the issues they may cause, at the same time as customers, according to Brooks.      “We're fixing that by migrating all of our technology onshore over the next few months,” he said. “One of the most important initiatives that I'm working on today is to achieve full technology independence, over a short amount of time.”    White-labeled BNB?    Brooks highlighted Binance’s BNB token as an “insanely important customer loyalty” vehicle for the exchange – and one that could be farmed out to other firms.      “Some of the early work that we've been doing since I joined the company is talking to arts brands, record labels, major consumer ecommerce platforms and others about how the lessons of the BNB token could be adapted in their businesses,” said Brooks.      He raised the prospect that Binance.US could “literally white-label” a loyalty token for an airline, a consumer brand or a tight-knit artistic community.      “[They could] extract value from their community and create stickiness in their world the same as we create stickiness to our world with BNB,” he said. “And we can trade their tokens.”      The big-brand tokenization play, he said, is an example of the exchange chasing an “internet model, not a financial services model.”      “Look at Google, not Bank of America, as what we aspire to,” said Brooks.",NEGATIVE,BNB,EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | ZRX | BNB,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/27/binanceus-ceo-brian-brooks-excluding-crypto-banks-from-fed-system-is-dangerous,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d295107a29fde497821237e756115bf540511244-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42386880,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVi1V,1622144648,Soulja Boy Tells 'Em He Got Paid to Tweet,"Rapper and cryptocurrency fan Soulja Boy “kept it 2017” Wednesday when he revealed he was being paid to promote a possible Ponzi scheme. The apparent accident could expose him to punitive action by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which handed out big fines and settlements when public figures including DJ Khaled, Floyd Mayweather and Paris Hilton promoted so-called initial coin offerings.      Soulja (or, more likely, a social media intern who is currently updating his or her resume) included the terms of his compensation in a tweet promoting a token called SaferMars. The tweet seemed designed to appear organic, with Soulja claiming he had “found an interesting project” that “looks moon worthy.”      But the last line of the tweet, which went out to Big Draco’s 5.2 million Twitter followers, revealed that Soulja didn’t just “find” the project: “They raising 240k, if they raise it after your tweet – will get you 24k.” (sic)    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist    Weirdly, the error may not actually be as dire as it seems. It must have eroded trust in Soulja Boy’s recommendations, but it could also act as a degree of legal cover.      You see, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has strict rules against what it calls “touting.” This is defined as promoting an investment, in exchange for payment, without disclosing that payment. It’s somewhat similar to the rules for advertising products, which require things like paid celebrity Instagram ads to be clearly marked “sponsored” or something similar.      Failure to disclose payment was at the root of several prior SEC actions against celebrity crypto promoters. In November of 2018, Mayweather and Khaled both reached massive settlements with the SEC after promoting an ICO called Centra without disclosing that they’d been paid to do it. Rapper T.I. reached a smaller settlement over similar charges. Actor Steven Seagal was hit with touting charges last year in connection with a project called Bitcoiin2Gen.      Most celebs seem to have learned their lesson: Figures like Paris Hilton, who also did some questionable promotion during the ICO boom, have instead pivoted to promoting non-fungible tokens (NFT). That may be less risky because the digital collectibles are probably not securities. But Soulja Boy, it seems, has doggedly stayed the crypto-shill course.      Despite having a name similar to the recently surging SafeMoon token, SafeMoon developers have said there is no affiliation between their project and SaferMars. That suggests an attempt to misdirect interest from another project.      The SaferMars website, meanwhile, is focused on token price rather than utility, which is never a good sign. That and the apparent willingness to gain mindshare through undisclosed paid promotion should both be regarded as red flags for anyone considering putting money in SaferMars. It also matters for Soulja Boy, because the SEC is generally much less forgiving of promoters of outright scams and frauds than of those who break the rules while promoting more legitimate investments.      There is one tiny silver lining in Soulja’s Twitter mishap. If the SEC eventually takes action against him, Soulja’s lawyer could argue that “will get you 24k” acted as a disclosure, aligning the SaferMars tweet with anti-touting rules.

Soulja Boy wouldn’t seem to be particularly desperate for the proceeds from a sh**coin pump and dump, having signed a fresh deal with Virgin Records in early April. But he has faced at least minor financial upheaval, with the fine jewelry dealer Icebox recently alleging he owed them money.      Soulja’s Twitter presence suggests he may still be open to, um, collaboration with crypto projects: Just hours after the SaferMars misfire, he was looking for recommendations for “the best new upcoming token.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TOKEN SALE,David Z.

42386888,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVi2l,1622135803,"Consensus 2021: Can Privacy Coins, Exchanges and Regulators Coexist?","The careful dance between global financial regulators and cryptocurrency exchanges saw a particularly big shift in January when the Bittrex exchange removed privacy coins monero and zcash as well as dash from its offerings. The self-custody exchange ShapeShift has also delisted the three coins, which was especially notable given ShapeShift’s hyper-libertarian founding ethos. (Representatives of the organization behind dash argued the coin was delisted based on a misunderstanding of its privacy features.)      Privacy coins are still available on major regulated exchanges including Kraken and Coinbase, but the delistings point to the inherent tension between exchanges and privacy coins. Financial regulators lean hard on centralized exchanges to monitor their users (one reason serious cryptocurrency users aren’t fans of the exchanges). Privacy coins, in principle, conceal information about where they’re sent, making such monitoring more difficult. Selling them may also draw added scrutiny from regulators simply out of distrust about their uses.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.    But that suspicion is likely misplaced. “There’s sort of been this insinuation that because you’re using digital currency that has additional privacy-preserving features that it’s inherently bad or you’re using it for improper reasons,” Grayscale VP Craig Salm told CoinDesk’s Colin Harper late Wednesday at the Consensus 2021 conference. ""And that's not true."" (Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.) At least according to existing analyses, a much lower proportion of cryptocurrency transactions are tied to criminal activity than is seen with U.S. dollar transactions.      Regulators may understandably regard privacy tokens and related technologies as ripe for abuse by money launderers and bad actors. But Wednesday’s panelists argued that restricting their use would be both legally misguided and bad for society. Salm argued, for instance, that exchanges restricting coins that have been “mixed” for anonymity was misguided: “At the end of the day, the technology shouldn’t be what’s being regulated, it should be the uses of the technology.""      “A cashless society is a surveillance society, and anonymity is absolutely necessary for civil liberties,” said Marta Belcher, who serves as general counsel of Protocol Labs and also works with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Many other observers, including the policy group CoinCenter, regard anonymous digital transactions as crucial for the preservation of civil liberties in the 21st century.    Read more: Consensus 2021: The Ongoing Fight for Privacy    For now, restrictions are coming slowly, and there are options for those who want to hold or use privacy coins. According to Salm, self-hosted software or hardware wallets such as Ledger should remain safe from scrutiny by agencies like the U.S. Treasury Department's FinCEN. That's because the coins are legally similar to cash, which generally isn’t subject to search or seizure without a warrant. (By contrast, according to Belcher, exchanges regularly turn over user data to governments without warrants.) The rising popularity and effectiveness of decentralized exchanges, or DEXs, poses an even more complex regulatory challenge.      The best solution to blunting regulatory overreach may be to offer regulators a form of oversight that doesn’t involve mass surveillance.      “The more you’re able to become surgical in understanding account behavior, the less you need to surveil all activity,” Solidus Labs COO Chen Arad told the panel. “That doesn’t necessarily mean having access to all this information, it’s about using more advanced data analytics [and] machine learning in order to connect various dots.”      Solidus Labs offers “crypto-native” compliance software that uses machine learning to evaluate risk. Arad thinks that may offer not just a workable compromise on privacy coins but a more nuanced vision of financial compliance in general.      “The more we’re able to work with regulators and give them the comfort ... that there are ways to point out actually malicious activity without revealing everyone’s information,” Arad said, “the less we’ll see very aggressive action coming from regulators.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,David Z.

42386881,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVhwT,1622127714,Binance Smart Chain Adds CipherTrace for Tracking Illicit Transactions,"Decentralized finance (DeFi), or at least Binance’s version of it, is officially being given the blockchain analytics treatment, courtesy of California-based CipherTrace.      Announced Thursday, CipherTrace’s transaction tracking and wallet attribution software will support Binance Smart Chain (BSC), a more or less decentralized base layer on which to run DeFi applications.      Why this is important is because CipherTrace, which has counted Binance as a client for some time, will likely appease crypto regulators with regard to the experimental DeFi space, an area the global anti-money laundering (AML) watchdog the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recently warned is on its radar.      It’s also a timely addition, given that Binance said this week at Consensus 2021 that rollbacks of the blockchain following exploits and hacks on BSC are not possible; so-called “rug pulls” on the community-governed chain are not Binance's responsibility, the exchange said.    Read more: Binance Says ‘Rollback’ Not Possible After DeFi Exploits on Binance Smart Chain    Binance Smart Chain spokesperson Simran Alphonso said the system is based on “progressive decentralization,” which basically means it’s faster and cheaper than alternative blockchains.      “It’s decentralized and the community handles it, but we [Binance] are also involved to an extent,” said Alphonso, adding:    “We cannot do any rollbacks because we do not have any sort of authority over the chain. We do have the ability to provide tools to monitor exploitations, hacks and scams. CipherTrace can help us understand that. But it has nothing to do with having more authority or being in a position of control.”    One of CipherTrace’s duties is assessing the degree of know-your-customer (KYC) activity that happens across the universe of virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and awarding scores, such as green for good, yellow for middling and red for poor.      So could this tie-up make for a more identifiable or KYC’d type of DeFi happening on BSC? Alphonso didn’t think so.      “I wouldn't really say it's a more KYC'd form of DeFi,” Alphonso said. “We still don't really know our customers. It's still just a 16-digit address. We don't really know whom it belongs to, where it's coming from. All that we know is if it has interacted with any illicit addresses in the past or if it's related to any scam or hack.”      CipherTrace works closely with global regulators particularly in areas like AML. So might this partnership lead to a slightly more palatable form of DeFi to the likes of the FATF?      “I can’t really comment on that,” Alphonso said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/27/binance-smart-chain-adds-ciphertrace-for-tracking-illicit-transactions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8dbb1950a0118a4badeb44a73c6070259e333d8a-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395292,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASYKtE,1622126242,White House Cyber Adviser Highlights Potential for Misuse of Crypto,"The potential for bad actors to exploit cryptocurrency is a top concern for one of the Biden Administration’s senior cybersecurity officials.  Citing crypto’s role in ransomware attacks, sanctions evasion and terrorist financing, Carole House, the director of cybersecurity and secure digital innovation at the National Security Council, argued Thursday that the tech’s backend demands some scrutiny, especially for unhosted wallets.  “A lot of the developers in the space created the systems without building in the kinds of protections that are needed for longstanding obligations,” House said during a Consensus 2021 panel on crypto regulation in the Biden White House.  She acknowledged that most crypto users aren’t bad actors – but some may be. She cited ISIS terrorists and North Korean hackers as potential recipients of “large amounts of value” that the government cannot control.  Against this, House said it is essential, and indeed reasonable, that the U.S. government step in with “obligations and controls” for crypto. “Traditional payments” already play by federal rules, she pointed out.  What those controls might look like in crypto remains a topic of heated debate. House told panel moderator Amanda Wick of crypto analytics firm Chainalysis that all policy options are on the table. Earlier Thursday, Michael Mosier, acting director of FinCEN, said his financial regulatory agency has made no decisions yet.  Read more: FinCEN’s New Head Says Controversial Trump-Era Crypto Proposal Is Still Pending  House echoed that sentiment. “I think it's been very clear that we haven't taken a position of banning it or making it illegal at all,” she said of crypto.

42386897,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBViE5,1622125594,Bitcoin Options Market Faces Smallest Expiry of Year – But It Could Still Drive Volatility,"The bitcoin options market is on track to record a modest monthly options expiry in the wake of the recent price crash – mainly because the cryptocurrency's price is so much lower. But there's still speculation some traders might try to use the moment to push prices as high as $50,000 to increase their payoff or minimize any payouts.      The May expiry, expected early Friday, would have been much bigger had it not been for bitcoin's recent drop from $58,000 to $30,000, which pricked the speculative bubble in the market.      Major exchanges are due to settle 55,900 contracts worth $2.2 billion on Friday, based on data from the provider Skew. That makes the upcoming May expiry the smallest of 2021 in terms of nominal value.      Almost all the options contracts will expire at 8:00 coordinated universal time (4 a.m. ET) – the designated time on Deribit, which is the dominant exchange for cryptocurrency options.      Open interest across all expiries – the total value of outstanding positions – nearly halved to $6.5 billion in the two weeks to May 23 and was last seen at just over $7 billion.      Settlement of monthly option contracts has gained relevance this year, with the ""max pain point"" – the strike price at which the most open options contracts expire worthless – serving as an overhang in the run-up to expiration (last Friday of the month).      For example, bitcoin fell from nearly $60,000 to $50,000 in the six days leading up to the March 26 expiry, narrowing the gap between spot prices and the then-max pain point of $40,000. And the cryptocurrency bounced by $4,000 to $54,000, reaching the max pain point ahead of the April expiry.      The idea is that the max pain point acts as a magnet for spot prices while heading into expiration. That's because option sellers, mostly institutions, sometimes try to push prices closer to the max pain point to inflict maximum loss on options buyers.      The max pain point for Friday's expiry is $50,000 – more than 25% above the current price of $39,500. Some investors are betting that the max pain effect will kick in ahead of the settlement, pushing prices toward $50,000, as tweeted by Swiss-based options analytics platform Laevitas.      While historical data supports the case for a pre-expiry rally, the size of the impending settlement is relatively small compared to previous expirations. For example, a record $6 billion worth of contracts expired at the end of March, while exchanges settled more than $4 billion of options earlier on April 30.      Thus, the max pain effect may not have big influence on the market ahead of Friday's settlement. However, other factors such as the renewed outflows from crypto exchanges may help the battered cryptocurrency gain some ground.      While nominal value has declined with the price drop, the number of contacts open on Deribit has remained mostly stable in the aftermath of the price crash.      The resilience could be attributed to increased option selling in the wake of the recent spike in implied volatility. Some Asia-based family offices and ultra-high-net-worth individuals sold put options earlier this week.

42386899,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBViGb,1622122629,Mayhem in Binance Leveraged Tokens During Crypto Crash Leaves Traders Fuming,"This month’s plunge in cryptocurrency markets led to steep losses in certain “leveraged tokens” issued by the crypto exchange giant Binance. That might sound like stating the obvious, but for some traders it was a nasty surprise because these particular tokens were designed to profit when prices fall.      Traders and investors who thought they scored big but ended up losers have flooded social media (and CoinDesk’s email inbox) with complaints that they were poorly served. Some claimed the tokens didn’t deliver as promised, or even went as far as to speculate that Binance had manipulated the tokens for its own benefit. “I’m not going to stop pressing this issue,” read one Reddit post.      Binance confirms that some traders lost money on the DOWN tokens, which are designed to profit when the underlying cryptocurrencies – such as ether (ETH) or bitcoin (BTC) – fall in price. A glance at the Binance tokens' tickers – ETHDOWN, BTCDOWN – shows how they're positioned in the market.      The exchange attributes the losses to an algorithmically driven rebalancing mechanism that it says worked as designed during the market meltdown. It added that the risks of the process were disclosed in advance.      In loosely regulated, anything-goes cryptocurrency markets, the traders may have little recourse, with no obvious investor-protection regulator as there is, for example, in the U.S. stock market. Yet, the episode has turned into a customer-relations debacle, and even Binance acknowledges it’s fielding a surge in complaints.      “Due to last week’s market volatility, we are experiencing higher than usual volumes of queries, so we also seek our users’ understanding and patience,” an exchange representative told CoinDesk.      The matter has turned so acrimonious Binance now says that “following last week’s extreme market conditions, we have reviewed and taken steps to improve the redemption process,” such as making it clear the leveraged tokens cannot be bought or redeemed during rebalancing.      The most widely cited losses took place during the market crash on May 19, when prices for bitcoin dropped nearly to $30,000, after trading above $43,500 earlier in the day.      Many Binance users saw an opportunity to capitalize on the massive sell-off and rushed to buy the inverse leveraged tokens. Demand spiked for BTCDOWN and ETHDOWN.      But instead of going up as the market tanked, the tokens’ prices declined in some instances, some buyers said, adding the supply of the tokens appeared to increase dramatically. Some traders provided CoinDesk with screenshots they said supported their claims, and many argued on Twitter, Reddit and Discord that Binance should be held responsible.      What happened, according to the Binance representative, is that as the tokens’ value went up, a large number of them were redeemed in a short period of time. The capital allocated as backing for the tokens declined sharply.    Read more: Binance Says ‘Rollback’ Not Possible After DeFi Exploits on Binance Smart Chain    From there it gets quite complicated, but that imbalance kicked in the algorithm, leading to a series of steps including injecting futures positions into the capital base, which in turn increased the leverage in the structures to a level higher than the targeted range. That triggered additional steps that eventually caused the prices to erode.      “This is why, despite best efforts, there is no way to reduce the leverage until the subscription and redemption of the tokens are suspended,” the representative said.      In some ways it was a twist of fate because in March 2020 Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao criticized competitor FTX for its leveraged tokens, arguing that users did not understand them well enough.      “The main reason for delisting is we find many users don’t understand them,” Zhao said at the time, in a since-deleted tweet. “Even with pop-ups warning users each time, people still don’t read it.”      He said Binance had delisted the FTX tokens, even though they were popular, and it was “bad for business.”      “Protecting users comes first,” Zhao wrote.      Binance went on to launch its own leveraged tokens in May 2020, saying the decision came “after careful consideration of user requests and evaluation of existing leverage products.”      The DOWN tokens are designed for users who want leveraged exposure to the prices of cryptocurrencies without the risks of liquidations, according to Binance’s official website. Each token tracks an underlying position, either bullish or bearish, in a perpetual contract with a variable leverage range.      New tokens are issued based on market demand.      In contrast with existing leveraged tokens like FTX’s, which are built atop the Ethereum blockchain, the Binance tokens are centrally provided. That means users are putting their trust in the exchange and don’t benefit from the data transparency and smart contracts of blockchain technology.    Read more: ‘So Many Locked Out’: Binance Users Say Their Accounts Have Been Frozen for Months    After last week’s incident, some posters on social media accused Binance of increasing the supply of some of its leveraged tokens out of thin air. Such claims are unfounded, according to the exchange.      “We only mint tokens based on user demand,” the Binance representative said. “We don’t control supply; that is entirely demand-driven.”      The Binance leveraged tokens also differ from competitors' in that they rely on a target range of variable leverage rather than a constant leverage ratio; for the BTCDOWN token, it ranges from 1.25 times to four times.      ""The target leverage isn't constant, and it isn't publicly visible,"" according to a primer titled ""A Beginners Guide to Binance Leveraged Tokens,"" which appears to have been posted or updated on Binance's website two days ago. ""Why is that? The main goal is to prevent front-running. If these tokens rebalance at predefined intervals, there could be ways for other traders to take advantage of this known event.""            In October, a few months after Binance listed its own leveraged tokens, the exchange published a blog post stating leveraged tokens are often “the most misunderstood” product in the crypto market.      ""Many traders get confused when a token's performance does not add up with its respective index,"" the post read.      According to the ""Beginner's Guide,"" the occasional rebalancing of Binance's leveraged tokens is supposed to address the performance ""drag"" that comes from holding them for a long time.      They ""only rebalance during times of extremely high volatility and aren’t forced to periodically rebalance otherwise,"" according to the guide.      Binance provided the example below of how the rebalancing algorithm works. Tl;dr: There’s a lot more to it than betting on price-go-up or price-go-down in already-risky spot cryptocurrency markets.    It would be easier to demonstrate using hypothetical numbers. Let's assume a DOWN token, with a capital fund size of $100 million and a total underlying futures positions of $180 million. The real leverage ratio is therefore 1.8x.When the DOWNUSDT perpetual futures prices goes down by 5%, the value of the underlying futures positions will increase by $9 million to $189 million. The DOWN tokens gained $9 million and the available capital is now $109 million. The real leverage ratio is now 1.73x.Now assume the price of DOWNUSDT perpetual futures goes down by another 120%. The futures position will increase by $226.8 million to $415.8 million, and the available capital gained $226.8 million to $335.8 million. The real leverage ratio decreases to 1.238x.Since the real leverage ratio is out of the target leverage range of 1.25 - 4x, rebalancing is triggered, and the algorithm adds futures positions to increase the real leverage ratio, to within the target leverage range. For instance, if the algorithm decides to rebalance from 1.238x to 1.7x, it adds an additional $155.06 million worth of futures positions, increasing the total futures positions to $570.86 million which is 1.7x of the capital fund size.As the algorithm builds up more futures positions, the price of DOWNUSDT perpetual futures is lowered because of the large quantity of short positions held. Now suppose a large amount of DOWN tokens are redeemed by users, reducing the capital from $335.8 million to $130 million. This means the leverage is 4.39x. As the leverage is out of range now, the algorithm has to clear the short futures positions at an unfavorable price by buying long positions during a volatile and illiquid market, which causes erosion to the NAV. This may seem counterintuitive initially, but reducing futures positions may further increase the leverage during extreme market conditions.This is why despite best efforts there is no way to reduce the leverage until the subscription and redemption of the tokens are suspended.

For example, to learn about the composability of those items, how they are deploying modular types of components, and so, how we can be more flexible in our infrastructure.”  More than a comment    Earlier this month, ING acknowledged DeFi was probably going to be more disruptive to the banking system than bitcoin, issuing a paper on the subject that included a case study on DeFi platform Aave.

42386882,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVhxj,1622122200,US Financial Surveillance Agency Wants to Know More About Privacy Tech,"The U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) wants to increase its understanding of how privacy technology works, including those governing certain blockchain protocols.      The agency is expected to host a virtual program on Sept. 9 and is inviting companies ""developing solutions to privacy issues"" to participate, according to a press release on Wednesday.      FinCEN said the event will focus on the role of ""privacy-preserving principles"" in developing technical solutions that increase innovation in financial services while countering the well-worn narrative of illicit activity and national security risks.      Those being asked to tag along to the agency's ""Innovation Hours Program"" include fintechs, regtechs, venture capital firms and financial institutions.      See also: State of Crypto: FATF’s New Guidance Takes Aim at DeFi      Privacy solutions being targeted include cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) and homomorphic encryption. ZKP allows two parties to prove a value is true, such as x, without revealing the identity of either party.      Though the concept stems from the 1980s, its technology has been bootstrapped to certain blockchain projects and protocols, including those used by Zcash and Mina.      The agency is asking participants to demonstrate, in one-hour meetings, just how these types of solutions operate and how businesses use them. That includes ways in which the privacy solutions can be utilized for private and public sector efforts, per the release.      “We support responsible innovation,"" said Michael Mosier, FinCEN's newly appointed acting director, ""especially that which promotes the resilience and safety of our financial system and the American people.""      Mosier, who worked at blockchain surveillance firm Chainalysis as chief technical counsel before his departure in 2020, will likely bring additional knowledge regarding blockchain privacy to the agency's event.

42386872,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVdOf,1622116800,FinCEN's New Head Says Controversial Trump-Era Crypto Proposal Is Still Pending,"The cryptocurrency industry doesn’t have to worry about an overly burdensome U.S. regulation on unhosted, or private, wallets just yet.      “Nothing’s been decided” on the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s (FinCEN) proposed rule to collect counterparty data for transactions to unhosted wallets and require currency transaction reports (CTRs) for transactions over $10,000, the acting head of the regulatory agency said Thursday.      FinCEN continues to engage with the cryptocurrency industry about the controversial proposed rule, which critics claim would make it difficult – if not impossible – to use certain smart contracts and otherwise impose a heavy compliance burden on exchanges, said Acting Director Michael Mosier in a pre-recorded interview with Jill Carlson at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2021 conference.      The rule was proposed at the end of 2020 with support from former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. An originally brief public comment period on the proposal was extended in January, before a second extension gave industry participants 90 days to respond.      “There was a point where there was a really strong sense of urgency among political leadership in the last administration for a variety of factors on timing and what the risks and concerns were to address this,” Mosier said Thursday. “And I think what you saw was the moment we were given the ability to extend that comment period we did, and continued on with our engagement with industry on that.”      Mosier is one of a number of regulators reviewing the last presidential administration’s actions. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced last week that it was reviewing actions undertaken in 2020 by its former head – Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks – as well.      Mosier became the acting head of the domestic financial law enforcement agency this year, succeeding Kenneth Blanco who abruptly stepped down. While he’s been a longtime public servant – working as a state and federal prosecutor prior to his roles at FinCEN – Mosier has also spent time in the private sector, first as an attorney in the technology practice of a law firm, and later as chief technical counsel at crypto analytics firm Chainalysis.      He told Carlson his view of his role stems from his interest in personal sovereignty and innovation, and protecting individuals from financial abuse or having their privacy invaded.      “I sort of went into the path of public service doing pro bono work for victims of domestic violence, to help them get protective orders,” he said. “And that really sort of put me more in the personal sovereignty space.”      Many individuals were abused financially, Mosier said, and so privacy and personal sovereignty may be two tools to help protect individuals.      “Money is a great enabler of a lot of opportunity, but it's also an enabler and a driver of a lot of exploitation,” Mosier said. “How do you balance that transparency, that's going to allow people to have faith in the system that they're dealing with and that they're not going to be exploited in it ... versus having this sort of mix of privacy but also that's not unaccountable anonymity?”    Financial Intelligence Unit    Part of FinCEN’s mandate as a Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) is to look for trends or risks by analyzing data, Mosier said.      The agency can also be tasked with studying specific incidents. Mosier referred to the riots that occurred at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 as one issue that FinCEN could study. A blogger sent just over 28 BTC to 22 wallets linked to far-right individuals and entities ahead of the riot.      “There was cryptocurrency involved ... [about] $500,000, which actually is more than enough to fund something like [the riot],” he said. “And that’s the sort of thing that activates Congress.”      It turned out the crypto landed in hosted wallets (wallets linked to exchanges), but Mosier said Congress may ask how he is watching for other potential domestic terrorist attacks and the possible use of crypto.      Ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure like hospitals is another similar issue that FinCEN must watch for, he said, indicating that if FinCEN can proactively spot and address these concerns, it could prevent overly burdensome regulations from being implemented.      “When Congress acts, it's very difficult to undo anything they do or modulate it, whereas if we can say, ‘Well, actually, we're making a lot of progress,’ which doesn't necessarily mean a rulemaking at all, it just means that we're coming up with solutions. That's the place where you want to be,” he said.    Industry engagement    FinCEN’s proposed rulemaking drew a “very strong outpouring” of criticism after the agency introduced it, Carlson noted, asking how the crypto industry can better engage with policymakers who are designing regulations around the 12-year-old industry.      “It's important to understand that not everybody in government is inherently suspicious of crypto,” Mosier said. “There's a lot of people that are very interested in it and feel like it has incredible potential, including on the financial inclusion side, but also just the technical solution to a lot of policy issues.”      Industry participants should engage with those policymakers who are either pro-crypto or at least curious about the technology “in a non-negative way” to help them understand what the technical solutions to certain policy questions would look like.      They should also acknowledge the risks in these conversations, Mosier’s said, joking:    “Twitter might not be as conducive to that.”    Some of these government employees have been looking at crypto since 2011, he said.      “Don’t just send us your lawyers,” he said. “Send in the technical experts, the core developers.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/05/27/fincens-new-head-says-controversial-trump-era-crypto-proposal-is-still-pending,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9d5b9cec97df61a444af8aaf16fb8445d83b0927-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42386856,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVd9Z,1622116800,"Meme.com, a Platform Pairing Memes With Tokens, Raises $5M","Recently launched Meme.com has raised $5 million from blockchain-focused venture capital funds including Outlier Ventures, Digital Finance Group, Morningstar, Blockhype, Spark Digital Capital and other investors.      The firm said Thursday that over a dozen investors contributed to the round, with additional funding coming from angel investors Gabby Dizon, CEO of Altitude Games, and Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal.      With so-called memecoins like dogecoin and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) having soared in popularity in recent months, the company said it aims to bridge the two markets.      Meme.com sets out to unite meme markets and trends with “memetic tokens,” NFTs and digital art.      Users are able to mint tokens based on the perceived value of the meme they represent, while others can stake the tokens.      The firm said content around each meme is crowdsourced by the community and the most popular memes receive rewards that include special NFT art.      “We believe that memes and meme markets, such as Meme.com, are a promising and innovative way to empower users who find or create trends,” said Joanna Liang, head of investment at Digital Finance Group.    CoinMarketCap for memes    Meme.com co-founder Mattias Tyrberg, who goes by the title “Sir Stonks,” told CoinDesk the $5 million funding will be used for further development of the platform, marketing and user growth.      “We have long-term plans and with this funding we have secured the project for many years,” said Tyrberg.      The platform will also offer data tracking for the memes, allowing their value to be compared over time. A press statement the platform wants to be ""like a CoinMarketCap for memetic content.""      “We collect data on the popularity of a meme both from external and internal sources,” said Tyrberg. “External can be number of mentions or image shares.”      Read more: Vitalik’s Regift of Unsolicited DOGE Knockoffs Sends Memecoin Prices Plunging      Meme.com, which launched on May 24, already has a platform called Marble.Cards for creating and collecting cards based on websites, which provides a lot of meme data, he added.

Be sure to look through the guide to see everything that’s on offer today.

The seven-day average of net bitcoin inflows to exchanges turned negative for the first time since April 22, data provided by Glassnode show.  That means coins are leaving exchanges after a gap of four weeks, a sign of investors are starting to take direct custody of their holdings, possibly anticipating a price increase.  The fewer coins available for sale on exchanges, the better the chance of the market going up.  Investors typically transfer coins to exchanges when they want to sell their holdings, so consistent net inflows represent a bearish mood, with outflows signaling bullish sentiment.  The seven-day average of net flows turned positive on April 22, and rose to a 14-month high of 10,628 BTC on May 17, a sign some holders may have been panicking.  The bitcoin sell-off gathered pace, with prices dropping to lows near $30,000 on May 17. The decline marked a slump of more than 50% from the record-high $64,801 reached on April 1.  The panic looks to have subsided this week, with the balance held on exchanges dropping by 7,597 BTC to 2.53 million.  Further outflows from exchanges may be needed to restore battered market confidence and put the cryptocurrency back on a bullish path.  Consistent outflows accompanied bitcoin's 13-month surge from $5,000 to over $60,000, with the balance held in exchange wallets falling by more than 615,000 BTC from March 2020 to April 2021.

42386869,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVdM9,1622083589,Cory Doctorow's Web3 Rallying Cry: 'Seize the Means of Computation',"To Cory Doctorow, internet users have become serfs to the barons and nobles of Silicon Valley – and it’s up to 21st century digital Robin Hoods to liberate them.      “We live in this world where bandits run amok, wanting to do terrible things to you and your data,” the science fiction author, blogger and privacy advocate said Wednesday night at Consensus 2021. “But rather than defending yourself, you can ally yourself with a warlord like Apple or Google or Facebook or Salesforce.”      In this “feudal security model” (a phrase Doctorow attributed to cryptography legend Bruce Schneier), when the masses try to vote with their dollars or their clicks, as they would in a free market, they can’t escape the oligopoly power of tech giants.      “Both implicit and explicit forms of collusion, combined with a monopoly rent by not having to compete, allows firms to really structure markets and create policies that advantage them,” he said.      For example, one of the oldest web behemoths, Yahoo, ""wanted to have a roach motel, not an interoperable piece of an ecosystem, and that enclosure game was played through acquisitions.”      More recently, “people left Facebook in droves for Instagram. And Mark Zuckerberg, … a man who constantly trips over his own [overconfidence], said, ‘Hey, we need to buy Instagram.’” Which Facebook did in 2012.      By 2017, when then-President Donald J. Trump hosted a meeting of CEOs at Trump Tower, “the whole tech industry leadership fit around one table,” Doctorow said.      And while he blamed the concentration of power in no small part on weakened antitrust enforcement in the U.S. since the Ronald Reagan administration, Doctorow said a legislative solution, such as mandating data portability, could take too long.      “Lawmaking moves at the speed of lawmaking, and tech moves at the speed of tech,” he said.      Hence, he made an impassioned case for a largely bottom-up solution: Web 3.    'Adversarial interoperability'    The term Web 3 refers broadly to a movement to re-decentralize the internet, replacing the current hub-and-spoke architecture with something more distributed and closer to the old model of clients and servers. Blockchain and cryptocurrency are an epiphenomenon of this push, and arguably may help achieve the goals, though are not necessarily essential to it (more than that later).      “Web 3 is really attuned to the problem of freedom,” Doctorow said, later calling on listeners, after Karl Marx, to “seize the means of computation.”      Interoperability, or the ability of different computer systems to exchange information with each other, is a big part of this vision for Doctorow.      “Once everyone's on Facebook, that's a strong reason to join Facebook unless you can talk to Facebook without being a member of Facebook,” Doctorow explained. “And then you can talk to your friends without having Mark Zuckerberg looking at your underwear.”      But since Facebook and its ilk cannot be relied upon to support interoperability, and could find sneaky ways to get around regulatory mandates to do so, “I think we need adversarial interoperability, the hacker mentality,” Doctorow said.      Adversarial interoperability describes applications or code that can “plug into” existing software without permissionof the company.      For example, Doctorow described a scenario where a company “nerfs down,” or weakens, users’ access to their own data through application programming interfaces (APIs). Hackers could then “suddenly deploy like, a million bots and scrapers and reverse engineers” who would “add their own post-hoc APIs.”      This would leave the tech Goliaths “mired in awful guerilla warfare that has totally unquantifiable risks that they can never plan for,” disincentivizing them from pulling such stunts, Doctorow went on.      In this way, he envisions Web 3 “giving us back not ‘move fast and break things’ [Zuckerberg’s infamous motto] but rather that everything can interoperate and if they tell you that this won't plug into that, it doesn't mean you have to take their word for it. That to me feels like an exciting watershed.”    Skeptical on cryptocurrency    Doctorow is a special adviser to the Electronic Frontier Foundation. His recent book, “How to Destroy Surveillance Capitalism,” outlines his idea that the tech monopolies we see today will not persist beyond 2030, thanks to Web 3 and decentralized applications.      His interlocutor on Wednesday was Steven Waterhouse, CEO of Orchid, a crypto-powered virtual private network (VPN) that is an early use case for how decentralized networks can strengthen internet privacy.      Orchid offers a VPN built on the Ethereum blockchain where users can employ its native ERC-20 token, OXT, to pay for bandwidth from a global network of nodes. Anyone making a staked deposit of Orchid tokens shares surplus bandwidth in the service of creating a peer-to-peer ecosystem for internet privacy.      But there was little if any crypto shilling during Waterhouse’s conversation with Doctorow, who sounded a tad skeptical about how much digital currency can help bring the internet back to its freewheeling roots.      “I don't think blockchain and cryptos are going to make everyone so rich that they all have FU money and don't have to pay attention to what the law says,” Doctorow said. “That can't be our answer because there are 5 billion or 7 billion people on Earth. I'm no economist, but I think if everyone has FU money it stops being FU money. At that point, that's just normal, non-FU money.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Cyrus Rothwell-Ferraris,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/05/27/cory-doctorows-web3-rallying-cry-seize-the-means-of-computation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/50ac964d35ee1bb988d2bff5842f2903350f9629-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With little idle capacity in overseas hosting sites, some miners plan to go underground and continue to operate in other parts of the country, which might be only feasible for some of the biggest miners.      If mining power is too centralized, a few miners could manipulate the market by controlling the supply of bitcoin, or rewrite transactions on the immutable distributed ledger in the bitcoin network and shut out smaller miners with over 50% of the network’s mining power.      Xinjiang, Sichuan and Inner Mongolia have been popular regions for Chinese miners due to their cheap electricity. While the miners run their mining machines with hydropower in Sichuan during the rainy season in the summer, they migrate to the other two regions that chiefly have coal in the winter.      It is likely that miners will move from these mining hubs in western China to the east, where they can put the mining machines into factories, said Zheng, who was an early investor in bitcoin mining in China. The miners could also send a few mining machines to each household in the countryside, he said.      While the crackdown will be focused on mining hubs, it might be harder to implement if mining sites are in multiple discreet locations across the country, according to Zheng.      The electricity cost will certainly rise, but the factories and individual households could easily get millions of mining machines up and running again, Zheng said.      Chinese mining firms have also been trying to find overseas hosting sites since the crackdown.      But major global mining hubs such as Kazakhstan and Russia have little to no idle capacity to support new machines. Mining farms in North America are expanding their operations but that will take a long time to reach sufficient capacity to host the majority of Chinese miners’ mining machines, according to Ethan Vera, chief operating officer at Luxor.      “It is impossible to move all of the mining machines in China abroad,” Zheng said. “Miners have to figure out a way to keep the machines running.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/05/27/why-chinas-crackdown-may-make-bitcoin-mining-more-centralized,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1e6ce49eee183b51d46d36896ab60655198ea668-1500x927.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386861,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVdEb,1622076510,Binance Says 'Rollback' Not Possible After DeFi Exploits on Binance Smart Chain,"Decentralized finance protocols built atop Binance's smart-contract blockchain, Binance Smart Chain, have suffered an increasing number of hacks or exploits. Those include an exploit earlier this month on bEarn Fi that resulted in an $11 million loss.      A Binance representative on Wednesday suggested that's just the way things are in DeFi, and there's little the world's largest exchange can do to roll back the exploits. It's the case even though the exchange retains a significant degree of control over Binance Smart Chain, making it far more centralized than competing blockchains.      “BSC is a public permissionless infrastructure so anybody can deploy projects there,” Samy Karim, a coordinator of business and ecosystem development at Binance, said at CoinDesk's Consensus 2021. “You have malicious actors there and hacks, and exploits in DeFi are not new and definitely not unique to BSC.”      “It is not possible in the way that a lot of people think for there to be some kind of rollback,"" Karim said.      In just under nine months, BSC has grown dramatically, making headlines as one of the more competitive rivals to the Ethereum blockchain, sometimes referred to collectively as “Ethereum killers.”      The BSC blockchain's security algorithm, known as Proof-Of-Staked-Authority (PoSA), is controlled by 21 node operators, which are elected by Binance Coin (BNB) holders. But Binance is one of the largest holders of the BNB tokens, so it still has significant control.      After some of the recent exploits, some Twitter users have criticized Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, demanding that the exchange take responsibility for the exploits, colloquially referred to as “rug pulls” in the industry jargon.
