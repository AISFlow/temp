42380631,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yVmF,1525125612,Bitcoin Cash Is Bitcoin? Lawsuits Won't Stop the Fight Over Bitcoin's Name,"""Roger Ver deserves to go to (back to) jail for fraud.""  For those not immersed in bitcoin's byzantine politics, it might seem strange to see Ragnar Lifthrasir, a self-described ""passionate advocate for bitcoin,"" wish incarceration on an early adopter and fervent evangelist the community once called ""Bitcoin Jesus.""  But Lifthrasir isn't alone in his desire to lock Ver up a second time (Ver was sentenced to 10 months in prison in 2002 for selling explosives on eBay). His j'accuse was retweeted over 500 times in just over 24 hours, and a Reddit thread on the same subject featured multiple accusations of fraud and calls for jail time.  Rather, the allegations started after it was noticed that the block explorer, a tool for visualizing data on Bitcoin.com, an educational site that Roger Ver owns, had labeled what many consider the ""bitcoin cash protocol,"" the version of the blockchain that forked off bitcoin this past August, ""bitcoin.""  Just ""bitcoin.""  And for many, like Lifthrasir, that slight deviation from how the majority defines the two competing cryptocurrencies was the last straw.  Indeed, after nearly a year of infighting between the two camps, some Reddit users went so far as to call for people to report Bitcoin.com to the Internet Crime Complaint Center at the FBI. And, at time of writing, a Telegram group called ""Bitcoin.com lawsuit crowdfund"" has even picked up more than 900 members.  Even those who have expressed positivity toward the bitcoin cash blockchain and its potential value as yet another experimentation in the market, were aghast.  Cobra, a pseudonymous cryptocurrency enthusiast, told CoinDesk, ""I think it's criminal behavior.""  Cobra continued:  ""While it's fine for one to have the personal opinion that bitcoin cash is similar to what was described in the bitcoin white paper, presenting bitcoin cash itself as bitcoin on a commercial website visited by thousands of newbies daily looking to learn about the actual bitcoin is just deceptive and fraudulent.""  Round two ... or three?  Stepping back, the fight that Roger Ver finds himself at the center of is rather a longstanding argument about who or what defines bitcoin. Is it the code? The white paper?  Or perhaps it's the case, as Casa engineer Jameson Lopp argued, ""There is no web site, forum, social media account, foundation, code repository, conference, enterprise alliance, or organization of any kind that defines bitcoin.""  Certainly, there have been varying interpretations, a fact made worse by the lack of clear agreement on a common reference point.  Ver's own belief, which he's expressed multiple times over the years, is that the true bitcoin must fulfill ""Satoshi's vision"" of a ""peer-to-peer electronic cash system,"" a term laid down in the original white paper, published in 2009.  And this lack of strong historical agreement appears to have become fodder for Ver, who has arguably sought to highlight this fact in recent public statements.  Indeed, bitcoin's own software has introduced more than one interpretation over the years, though the goal has always been the same, to help those running the software judge the validity of a transaction history, if and when there are competing versions.  To this day, the computing program includes something called ""best chain"" logic in its consensus rules, though it differs from how it was originally implemented.  At launch, the rule stated that the correct bitcoin blockchain was the ""longest chain,"" the one with the largest number blocks of data contributed by miners. Very early on, though, that rule was changed to follow the chain with the most ""proof of work,"" the computing power expended by miners, which updates and secures the blockchain.  Developers have largely agreed the change was for the better, arguing that the ""longest chain"" logic was flawed. However, it's noteworthy that ""longest chain"" has been an element of the argument for years, even being frequently evoked by businesses in the debate leading up to the bitcoin cash fork and thereafter in other fork debates.  A provocation  Still, while Ver's point may be rooted in an old debate, it's his methods for disseminating his views that appears to be sparking outrage.  On Friday, for instance, Ver tweeted a list of all the ways that one might consider a piece of software ""bitcoin,"" including criteria he credits to bitcoin cash: low fees and fast and reliable payments.  In fact, he went so far as to argue that bitcoin cash beat out bitcoin core in every category, except for ""longest chain, with most proof of work."" (Because bitcoin core's network of miners is larger, the chain unquestionably has more computational power.)  Tensions have continued to run high since then, though, primarily because Ver continues to refer to bitcoin cash as bitcoin.  Speaking to CoinDesk, however, he defended his actions and dismissed the threat of litigation, saying that it ""seems strange"" as ""bitcoin is open source and permissionless."" Ver believes, in short, that he doesn't need anyone or anything to dictate what he believes bitcoin to be.  These arguments have inspired comparisons between bitcoin and religion in the past, a theme that has emerged again in the past week.  Indeed, Ver speaks on the subject with a passion of someone giving a sermon. At a conference in April, he said that refusing to accept bitcoin cash as the real bitcoin delays the technology's adoption, and that ""means more babies are dying in countries around the world.""  It's a comment that lent itself to a fair bit of mockery owing to its hyperbole. Still, it's worth noting that such barbs have also been launched by those faithful to bitcoin core developers and their software.  Twitter user Armin van Bitcoin, for instance, has accused Ver of promoting ""rat poison"" in his marketing of bitcoin cash as bitcoin.  A lack of consensus  Meanwhile, the software's developers appear a bit more agnostic about all the infighting.  When queried, a few representatives from the volunteer group remarked that there's no real answer as to what constitutes bitcoin, owing to the decentralized nature of the software.  ""Ultimately, I think personally you cannot objectively define bitcoin, and I've tried,"" said one long-time bitcoin core advocate, who goes by the pseudonym 'Shinobimonkey.'  And there are many reasons for this.  Elizabeth Stark, CEO of a company building next-generation bitcoin technology, Lightning Labs, offered an example. Suppose a government ""attacked"" the bitcoin blockchain and was then in possession of the ""longest valid chain"" and could change its rules.  That wouldn't necessarily be bitcoin, she argued.  ""Bitcoin is a shared collective belief where the longest valid chain is a factor,"" she said.  Others remarked how other decision-making frameworks are similarly inadequate.  ""If someone working for Ford Motors left, and built a new car company that became more valuable than Ford, it doesn't magically just become Ford Motors,"" Shinobimoney said, adding:  ""At this point, [in my opinion] it comes down to incumbency.""  Legal action unlikely  Still, it's almost certain that someone will try to sue Ver at this point, but according to Jason Siebert, a cryptocurrency attorney, their prospects of success are dim.  ""The only people with a claim would be those that purchased BCH instead of BTC thinking they were buying bitcoin,"" he wrote recently.  Even if private individuals did bring a civil lawsuit, it could only result in orders for corrective action or a fine. Ver would not receive jail time, two attorneys specializing in cryptocurrency confirmed to CoinDesk.  In theory, the Department of Justice could file criminal fraud charges against Ver, but for that to happen, his actions would have to meet the rigorous standard of ""specific intent to defraud specific people.""  As Matt Gertler, senior analyst and counsel at Digital Asset Research points out, Ver's public insistence that bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin could make it ""difficult to prove that he knowingly misrepresented the truth.""  What's more, these points are moot, because Bitcoin.com does not sell bitcoin cash in the U.S. In jurisdictions where it does sell bitcoin cash, the pagehttps://www.bitcoin.com/guides/how-to-buy-bitcoin-cash-with-a-credit-card clearly distinguishes between bitcoin cash and bitcoin core; there is no option to purchase just ""bitcoin.""  So no, Ver is not going back to jail, but his dogmatism has dragged the scaling debate to new depths.  As Cobra said:  ""Imagine if after the American War of Independence and the U.S. was born, George Washington ran around telling people that 'USA is England' … and said he was implementing the true vision of the Magna Carta.""

""If you want to know what our markets would look like with no securities regulation, what it would look like if the SEC didn't do its job? The answer is the ICO market,"" he told the network.  Jackson notably remarked that ""what I'll say about bitcoin, in general, is that space has been full of troubling developments,"" going on to say:  ""Investors are having a hard time telling the difference between investments and fraud.""  Like SEC chairman Jay Clayton, Jackson said he has not yet seen an ICO token which does not look like a security.  Later in the interview, Jackson said that while the SEC is largely limiting itself to seeking enforcement actions against illegal activities in the market at present, the agency might step up its regulation of the space more broadly in the future.  ""We are right now focused on protecting investors who are getting hurt in this market and down the road, we will be thinking about, I think we should be thinking about ways to make those investments work with our securities laws,"" he said.

The Berkshire Hathaway chairman and CEO – and the world's third-wealthiest person, according to Forbes – has long been skeptical of bitcoin. In his latest comments on the subject, he told Yahoo Finance on Saturday, ""If you buy something like bitcoin or some cryptocurrency, you don't really have anything that has produced anything. You're just hoping the next guy pays more.""  He continued:  ""There's nothing wrong with it. If you wanna gamble somebody else will come along and pay more money tomorrow, that's one kind of game. That is not investing.""  Buffett bought Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile mill, in the early 1960s and turned it into one of the world's most successful investment vehicles. According to his most recent letter to shareholders, the firm's share price has increased by 2.4 million percent since the takeover, compared to 15,500 percent for the broad stock market.  That success has been attributed to a strategy of buying strong firms with business models that are simple to understand and difficult to disrupt. That philosophy has led Buffet to be skeptical of the technology sector and of bitcoin in particular, which he called a ""mirage"" in March 2014.  Bitcoin was trading at around $600 when Buffett made that comment. In January, when the price was around $14,000, Buffett doubled down, saying cryptocurrencies ""will come to a bad ending."" The cryptocurrency's price is close to $9,300 at the time of writing.  One of Buffett's most famous quotes is ""our ideal holding period is forever."" In Saturday's comments, he further criticized bitcoin, arguing its value is too dependent on trading.  ""Now if you ban trading in farms, you can still buy farms and have a perfectly decent investment,"" he said, but if trading in bitcoin was banned, people would have no reason to invest.  He did not address the bitcoin ""hodler"" movement, whose advocates urge investors never to sell.

Announced Monday, Nexo provides loans or extends a line of credit using its own assets, said managing partner Antoni Trenchev.  To that end, the startup raised $50 million from investors, which will be used to provide liquidity to the company's platform. This departs from existing crypto-backed lending solutions, which instead connect borrowers with other individuals willing to loan out their funds.  This structure allows Nexo to provide instant loans without requiring credit checks or the time delay that manual approval processes require, Trenchev said.  The startup, which was spun off from European fintech firm Credissimo, is using blockchain security firm BitGo's digital wallet as its custodian, Trenchev told CoinDesk. Further, the company is now looking to team up with a small Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation bank to store assets.  He added:  ""All of the software, all of the automation process is something we have developed ourselves, and most of the tools, we have used them for several years. All of our software and automation process are [used by Credissimo]. … We have developed our own models of insuring and protecting our business.""  Notably, the company is backed and advised by TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington, who told CoinDesk that he is one of the startup's financial backers.  Nexo is acting similarly to a bank with its lending model, according to Arrington.  ""I haven't seen anyone do a good job so far of providing liquidity for people who have cryptocurrencies without forcing them to sell the cryptocurrency, or to put it more succinctly, provide a proper credit line to people who own cryptocurrencies,"" he said.  Trenchev said Nexo wants to set a precedent for traditional financial institutions, namely banks, and prove that cryptocurrencies can be trusted as an asset.  ""If you look at the trend with cryptocurrencies, volatility is going down, it’s still very volatile ... [but] we are pretty confident that volatility is on a downward trend and will continue to do so, which will make our model even more robust than it is,"" he said.  Ultimately, Trenchev concluded, Nexo's benefit comes from the fact that it lets clients ""spend the value of [their] crypto without having to sell it.""

EY Predicts Blockchain Could Change C-Suite Role,"""Big four"" professional services firm Ernst & Young (EY) suggests that blockchain technology could transform the firm's finance operations and redefine the role of chief financial officer (CFO) in a report published last week.  ""Blockchain could revolutionize the way finance function operates,"" the report reads. ""It will arm the CFO with tools and capabilities to allow him or her to become a key business partner in the strategic planning process while running a very efficient and trustworthy operation.""  The report identifies CFO-related blockchain uses cases, noting that the technology can help executives meet objectives such as ""getting your house in order,"" business development and communication with the external marketplace.  More specifically, the report suggests the implementation of a blockchain-based auditing system could fundamentally alter the ""scope and approach of an audit opinion"" from its existing focus on evaluating transactions to ""confirming the validity of digital representation of physical assets and codification of contracts.""  Likewise, EY claims the technology could decentralize organization structures, creating network systems which would provide better visibility and integration across an organization.  The report also argues that the transparency provided by blockchain technology could have an impact outside the organization too, allowing competing firms to have access to each other's information, facilitating a more ""collaborative and multi-enterprise environment.""  However, the authors caution that blockchain is still a nascent technology and, as such, its potential is not fully understood. Similarly, the report reads, ""organizations should make sure they are not comparing the theory of blockchain with the practical nature of technology implementations.""  There are also obstacles to adopting blockchain-based systems, the authors say, explaining:  ""That is, rolling out a blockchain across all functions with seamless integration would certainly solve a lot of problems, but many of our clients struggle to implement enterprise-wide data warehouses (which would do much of what we say blockchain technology can do), let alone a distributed database or network with all the associated maintenance difficulties.""

Mougayar will head up the new entity, dubbed JM3 Capital, under the Blockchain Technology Ventures division, which is being being spun off from Switzerland-based Jabre Capital Partners, according to an announcement on Monday.  The new branch aims to invest in blockchain startups, certain tokens and publicly tradeable cryptocurrencies, the firm said.  Every project or token that the fund invests in must show a high potential for appreciation, Mougayar told CoinDesk, explaining:  ""The strategy that we outlined is to do standard VC-style investments in blockchain companies. We’ll find those companies that are doing some very interesting work in the space. And, secondly, it’s to be involved in those that are creating the token-based protocols. Thirdly, it’s to invest in cryptocurrencies that are undervalued, so more of a buy-and-hold strategy.""  He stressed that Blockchain Technology Ventures is ""not a hedge fund,"" but ""more a venture capital-style fund that will take a long-term view to the market.""  Mougayar could not say if the firm has already planned to invest in any cryptocurrencies or startup projects, but he did not discount investing in any particular coin or token.  The company plans to launch its first fund in July, he said, pending final approval from Switzerland's Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). An application is in its final stages, and the fund will be regulated by authority after it launches.  ""I think this is going to be significant – it’s good to see more regulated funds. It’s good to see more regulation in this space because it brings more credibility to the market and a regulated fund lives up to higher standards – that's good for investors,"" he said.  Startups looking for funding will be able to pitch their tokens and projects to the company, according to Mougayar, who added he will be specifically interested in early-stage projects and will use his experience in investing to determine whether to grant funding.  ""There's a lot of pattern recognition,"" he said, adding ""the advantage of seeing a lot of activity is you can have better insights as to what constitutes a better [project].""  Projects will have to fit certain criteria to be considered for funding.  ""You have to have a good team that is competent, you have to show you can execute and it's not just theoretical,"" Mougayar said.

Working with tech giant IBM and financial services firm Suncorp New Zealand, ANZ is building a blockchain-based platform aimed to ease the transfer of data and premium payments between brokers and insurers, ultimately making processes faster and more transparent, a press release published Monday states.  According to Paul Goodwin, ANZ's managing director institutional for New Zealand:  ""This technology will work with existing industry solutions to capture relevant information; ensuring payments can be forecast and made without the need for reconciliation.""  Reconciling policy information and payments between broker and insurer is a ""slow and painful process,"" that can be addressed by the ""efficient, single source of truth"" blockchain solution, Goodwin added.  The planned solution stems from a proof-of-concept (PoC) that demonstrated blockchain's potential in solving inefficiencies in the reconciliation of ""bordereau"" statements – lists of premiums payable prepared by a broker for an insurer, an ANZ white paper notes.  The PoC was built with Fabric, a blockchain-based platform developed by the Linux Foundation-backed Hyperledger consortium.  ""We’re always looking at ways to generate operational efficiencies and the proof-of-concept was an exciting way to test whether a technology solution can speed up the reconciliation process for insurance premium payments, while at the same time improving the customer experience for policyholders and our business partners,"" Tim Buckett, chief financial officer at Suncorp New Zealand stated.  ""With this [blockchain solution], a future ecosystem with multiple insurers and multiple brokers is a viable outcome,"" the white paper says, envisioning that that platform would improve the proposition for the insured parties in the future.  ANZ has been involving in number of blockchain projects, including the completion of a trial effort in June 2017, aimed at digitizing the bank guarantee process for commercial property leasing. The trial saw participation from IBM, Westpac and shopping center operator Scentre Group.  The banking group also took part in completing a blockchain prototype, in 2016, along with Wells Fargo and Swift, that allows banks to reconcile payments sent via Swift using a distributed ledger.

42380591,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yQ5z,1525078818,Japanese Regulator Sees Boost In Cryptocurrency Queries,"Japanese consumers filed over three times the number of enquiries about cryptocurrency trading and initial coin offerings in 2017 as compared to the previous year, according to data released by Japan's Consumer Affairs Agency (CAA).  The numbers were disclosed at the second cryptocurrency exchange study group meeting hosted by Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) on April 27, providing a glimpse into the country's spiking interest in, and also concerns about, the cryptocurrency space.  Citing data compiled by the CAA, the FSA said a total of 2,769 domestic enquires were filed in 2017 by general consumers on topics related to cryptocurrencies in general. In comparison, data for the same in the previous three years was 847 in 2016, 440 in 2015 and 186 in 2014. Notably, the total for the earlier three years comes to around half of 2017's total alone.  The FSA further said a majority of the enquiries focused on concerns with trading platforms' security measures, as well as the legitimacy of certain ICO projects.  As an example, a typical kind of enquiry in the CAA data comes from parents raising concerns over whether their 19-year old son should start cryptocurrency trading even though legally he wouldn't need their permission to do so.  In addition, the number of enquiries received last year reflects concerns are spread more or less evenly across different age groups.  While consumers in their 40s and 50s dominated the pool with 510 and 488 cases, respectively, those in their 60s, 20s and over-70s were close behind with 410, 382, and 310 cases, respectively.  The latest data comes after the FSA for the first time released statistics on Japanese crypto trading after a meeting with 17 domestic cryptocurrency exchanges earlier this month.  As reported by CoinDesk at the time, Japan has at least 3.5 million cryptocurrency investors, based on data gathered by the 17 exchange platforms, with those in their 20s, 30s and 40s making up the major share of the total population.

42380598,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yQ9l,1525075229,How Blockchain Trade Finance Is Breaking Proof-of-Concept Gridlock,"Global trade is not just a question of moving merchandise from one point to another. Goods do need to move, but they do so through a web of intermediaries, each with distinct priorities and systems.  Exporters, importers, banks, truckers, shippers, customs agents and regulators all require checks and verifications at various points along the chain, and each interlocking part depends on successful completion of the previous phase, and of course, on reliable information.  It's no surprise, then, that the application of distributed ledger technology (DLT) in trade finance and supply chain management has for some time been a focus of financial institutions around the world. Banks play a large role in the chain, not only in the supply of letters of credit and other financing mechanisms, but also in the treasury management of its exporting and importing clients. And trade can be painful – risk has a financial and psychological cost, financing is not always easy to come by and working capital squeezes (when payment is late but costs have been incurred) affect entire operations.  Several of the trade finance DLT platforms currently under development were initiated by banks. We.Trade, for example, is a joint venture owned by nine of Europe's largest finance providers, while Batavia's development is led by UBS and IBM, with participation from a handful of banks in Europe and North America.  Unlike other bank trials that aim to test the technology (and which end up shelved due to the lack of a strong business case), these evolved to solve clients' pain points.  As Beat Bannwart, head of strategic innovation and market development for UBS, explained to CoinDesk:  ""The driving factor wasn't the need to find a blockchain use case, it was the clients' needs – they want a leaner, faster process in place, how to secure international trade transactions, how to finance them in order to grow their business.""  Hubert Benoot, chairman of We.Trade, agreed, adding: ""Clients are unhappy that, in a European context, their growing of trade is limited by the absence of good instruments to finance and cover risk.""  The principal pain points revolve around the bilateral nature of trade relationships – each component in the chain usually interacts one-on-one with another, leading to duplication of processes and a lack of transparency as to the state of a shipment.  Mapping the route  While both platforms are finance-oriented and client-centric, there are significant differences.  First, We.Trade is focused on small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) trading within Europe. Developed by KBC, Société Générale, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Natixis, Rabobank, UniCredit, Santander and Nordea, it intends to enable banks to facilitate trade transactions between their clients by offering greater transparency, more automation and lower risk.  Batavia, on the other hand, appears to have broader ambitions. Last week, it announced a pilot of two trade transactions, in which Audis were purchased in Germany by a Spanish business conglomerate, and raw materials were imported from Austria to Spain by a global leader in textile development.  While the trial was focused on Europe, it involved large corporations, and the presence of the Bank of Montreal in the consortium indicates a wider geographical scope.  Second, We.Trade is close to production. The platform’s participants credit its progress to the narrow focus and relative simplicity of its initial design.  Anne-Claire Gorge, global head of product management trade services at Société Générale (a shareholder of We.Trade), told CoinDesk that's the reason why the group managed to move fast and deliver a minimum viable product.  ""We don’t intend for the moment to offer something that would be the single entry point for companies to trade and tackle everything,"" she said.  We.Trade plans to begin testing the production version next month, with a commercial release expected over the summer. Banks will be invited to join on a licensing basis, which will enable them to offer the platform to their clients.  While the joint venture plans in the future to incorporate additional services such as onboard inspections and innovative financing products, for now the priority will be broadening the network.  Batavia has not specified a possible date for launch, although Bannwart expects to see “certain solutions come to fruition within the next 12-18 months.” He also stresses the platform’s relative focus. stating:  “While the platform needs to be universal, you will never succeed if you start with the whole world.”  There are hurdles ahead, though.  The main obstacle is the complexity of moving from proof-of-concept to pilot to production. Michael Spitz, CEO of Commerzbank’s main incubator (and a participant in the development of Batavia), observed the kind of considerations the transaction can bring.  “It’s one thing if, in a proof-of-concept, everything works on the test network, but the pilot is much more complex, because you start to combine the test network with legacy systems,"" he said. ""Once we have executed the pilot transactions, we are no longer in the sandbox, and the regulators will be looking.”  Still, We.Trade’s Benoot hinted that the interest from the regulators has so far been supportive, given the impact that increased trade within Europe could have in the region – SMEs account for around two thirds of total EU employment.  “I’m impressed by the knowledge of those regulators on blockchain, DLT, they know what’s happening in the market. They’re really interested in innovation, especially exports,"" he said.  Train of thought  Yet, these platforms present a good example of how blockchain-based technologies are about more than making current processes more efficient – they can open up new revenue streams.  Neither platform is trying to replicate existing trade finance formats. They both appear to be substituting the main options available today – letters of credit (bank guarantees that the purchaser will pay) and open account (where no guarantees are given and the trade is undertaken on trust) – with the new concept of “smart payments,” released when an action is triggered.  ""For We.Trade this is both a risk management solution and a working capital solution, in that the ‘bank undertaking of payment’ that the platform issues when a trade is initiated can then be separately financed, such as through discounting or forfeiting,"" Benoot said.  This is especially significant given that letters of credit are rarely used in intra-European trade, since each one can take as much as seven days to process (longer than it would take the goods to arrive at their destination).  What's more, the cost of each is often prohibitively high given the relatively small size of the orders. The increasing weight of ""open account"" trades (without payment guarantees) means that the exporter has to either insist on pre-payment or trust the importer, and the implied risk for either side is a barrier to growth.  Gorge of Société Générale further detailed: “It’s not necessarily a question of trade processes or bank fee savings, but also a new way of securing transactions where they currently don’t have solutions.”  We.trade was recently set up as a joint venture with the initiating banks as shareholders, overcoming what could have been another hurdle: governance.  As We.Trade’s Benoot explained:  ""Next to technical challenges, also collaboration is a challenge. We have created one company in which nine banks are shareholders. Notwithstanding the fact that we are independent, all the banks – in line with their internal governance and procedures - need to approve the services and the documentation. But we have shown that we can work together.""  New horizons  Other platforms are also moving forward, and new ones are emerging.  While perhaps not all of the ongoing proofs-of-concept will see the commercial light of day, it increasingly appears that trade finance will escape the spread of dropped trials and shelved pilots prevalent in other financial applications over the last few years.  Given the relative progress of each and the hurdles yet to be overcome, adoption will be choppy and fragmented for the short term. But as the underlying technology advances, regulatory stances adapt and compelling use cases propel joint development, a bigger picture takes shape.  Looking further ahead, we can catch a glimpse of a map of interconnected networks, interacting with legacy systems.  The cautious and focused approach taken by two of the most advanced projects so far belies the grander vision: a more robust and efficient system will not come through digitising current processes.  It will come through designing new ones, better suited to an increasingly complex global economy.  As UBS’s Bannwart observed:  “Blockchain is a network business – the value of the solution grows with its adoption. What we’ve seen throughout history is that if you have non-interoperable systems, on the one hand it’s good for competition because solutions are developed more quickly; but on the other hand, it could be like the old times when you had to carry a different phone for each region.”  Trade finance image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/04/30/how-blockchain-trade-finance-is-breaking-proof-of-concept-gridlock,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cd5d34504b31cf506b922a0e3e74017ec028da93-1500x884.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42380589,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yQ2D,1525071606,ICBC's First Blockchain Patent Is Now Public,"The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), one of the country's four largest state-owned commercial banks, is exploring a way to authenticate digital certificates and store data in a sharable blockchain.  According a patent application filed with China's State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO), the bank aims to use a blockchain system to improve the efficiency of certificate issuance and save users from repetitively filing the same document to multiple entities.  The technology, based on the patent, touts a system where a certificate issuer will first match a user's credential with a particular certificate digitally. After it's approved, the data will be encrypted and moved onto a blockchain which will update the distributed ledger held by different entities that could potential require this certificate.  By further decrypting the data with users' specific credentials, the system will allow entities to view an authenticated document digitally to streamline its operation flow.  The patent, currently the first blockchain-related one filed by the bank with the SIPO, was first submitted in November 2017 and released on Friday.  It explained that the technological exploration stems from the current pain point where consumers are constantly being required to submit the same certificate - such as for birth, marriage or eduction - by different entities they are dealing with.  ""Traditionally users have to obtain a certificate from an authority that issues it, which does that manually. And then they present it to entities that require the certificate. This process is inefficient and poses the counterfeit issue,"" the bank wrote in the document.  The patent application marks another effort taken by a Chinese state-owned commercial bank to utilize blockchain technology in data storage and sharing.  Recently, Bank of China has also detailed in a patent application its move to develop a technology that it claims to be better able to enhance blockchain's data storage and process capacity.

42380611,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yQQ7,1525068051,Mastercard Seeks 'Fast Track' Way to Sync Blockchain Data,"Payments giant Mastercard wants to patent a way to quickly add new nodes to a blockchain network, new filings reveal.  In a patent application published Thursday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the company outlines a method by which nodes can connect with and verify the contents of a particular blockchain. Per Mastercard, the idea is to boost the speed at which the nodes – which store a copy of that network's transaction history – can get up to date.  Mastercard first filed the application back in October 2016. And as the application explains, ""a blockchain may store thousands, millions, or even billions of transaction records over time in a vast number of different blocks.""  While this is part of its immutable nature, this also means the blockchain could ""contain thousands, millions, or billions of blocks, each of which must be verified by the new node prior to the generation and addition of new blocks to the blockchain.""  The payments firm goes on to say:  ""The verification of such a large number of blocks may take a significant amount of time, during which new blocks may be added to the blockchain, further delaying the ability for the new node to participate ... Thus, there is a need for a technical solution to increase the speed at which a blockchain may be navigated for verification thereof, which can thereby reduce the time required for a new node to begin participating in the blockchain.""  In order to do this, the proposed system would include so-called ""fast track flags"" included in block headers. Nodes, per Mastercard, would be able to use those flags to scan over the blockchain's contents more quickly.  Notably, the filing also discusses using a specially configured blockchain, which would act as the software counterpart to the nodes and help enable further efficiencies.

42380599,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yQCH,1525060534,Banking Giant ING Is Quietly Becoming a Serious Blockchain Innovator,"ING is out to prove that startups aren't the only ones that can advance blockchain cryptography.  Rather than waiting on the sidelines for innovation to arrive, the Netherlands-based bank is diving headlong into a problem that it turns out worries financial institutions as much as average cryptocurrency users. In fact, the bank first made a splash in November of last year by modifying an area of cryptography known as zero-knowledge proofs.  Simply put, the code allows someone to prove that they have knowledge of a secret without revealing the secret itself.  On their own, zero-knowledge proofs were a promising tool for financial institutions that were intrigued by the benefits of shared ledgers but wary of revealing too much data to their competitors. The technique, previously applied in the cryptocurrency world by zcash, offered banks a way to transfer assets on these networks without tipping their hands or compromising client confidentiality.  But ING has came up with a modified version called “zero-knowledge range proofs,” which can prove that a number is within a certain range without revealing exactly what that number is. This was an improvement in part because it uses less computational power and therefore runs faster on a blockchain.  For example, zero-knowledge range proofs (which the bank open-sourcedhttps://github.com/ing-bank/zkrangeproof last year) can be used to prove that someone has a salary within the range needed to attain a mortgage without revealing the actual figure, said Mariana Gomez de la Villa, global head of ING’s blockchain program.  “It can be used to protect the denomination of a transaction, but still allowing validation that there’s enough money in the participant account to settle the transaction,” she said.  Now, building on its past work, ING is adding yet another wrinkle to enterprise blockchain privacy, leveraging a type of proof known as “zero-knowledge set membership.”  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, ING plans to take the zero-knowledge concept beyond numbers to include other types of data.  Set membership allows the prover to demonstrate that a secret belongs to a generic set, which can be composed of any kind of information, like names, addresses and locations.  The potential applications of set membership are wide-ranging, Gomez de la Villa said. Not restricted to numbers belonging to an interval, it can be used to validate that any sort of data is correctly formed.  “Set membership is more powerful than range proofs,” Gomez de la Villa told CoinDesk, adding:  “For example, imagine that you could validate that someone lives in a country that belongs to the European Union, without revealing which one.”  Benefits of openness  But you don't have to just take ING's word for it. Since being open-sourced, the body of cryptographic work that ING is building on has been subjected to academic to peer review at the highest levels.  MIT math whiz and one of the co-founders of zcash, Madars Virza, revealed a vulnerability in last year’s zero-knowledge range proofs paper. Virza showed that, in theory, it was possible to reduce the range interval and so glean knowledge about a hidden number.  ING said it has since fixed this vulnerability, and Gomez de la Villa pointed out that this is the type of contribution expected from the ecosystem where the very purpose of open-sourcing is allowing users to fix bugs and improve functions.  “By making the source code available, improving our zero-knowledge range proof solution has become a collaborative effort,” she said.  She also framed the incident as an example of a mutually beneficial relationship between academic cryptographers and enterprises like ING.  ""They are working on the theory; we are working on the practice,"" Gomez de la Villa said, adding:  ""They can keep thinking about their crazy stuff and then we can say, 'OK, how can we use it in order to make it available to the rest so it can actually work?'""  Jack Gavigan, chief operating officer at Zerocoin Electric Coin Company, the company that develops the zcash network, said this type of open-source collaboration is contributing to a body of knowledge that all can draw upon, thus driving progress in the zero-knolwedge proof space at a rapid click. And those benefits will be returned in full.  “When a disruptive technology like blockchain comes along, it can shake things up, and companies that are best-positioned to embrace and exploit that technology are likely to end up at the top of the pile when things have settled down,” said Gavigan.  He continued:  “I think that's why you see companies like ING delving into this space, getting hands-on with the technology, and joining the broader community – because when this technology matures and is ready for prime time, they'll be ready and able to hit the ground running.”  Picking up from JPM  In other ways, the blockchain-savvy move is already paying off.  ING has been invited to the table with the world’s top cryptographers and will participate in an invite-only workshop in Boston seeking to standardize zero knowledge proofs, alongside the likes of MIT’s Shafi Goldwasser.  In this way, ING is now part of a wide community of experts extending the scope of zero-knowledge proofs.  At the start of this year, University College of London's Jonathan Bootle and Stanford's Benedikt Bunz released “Bulletproofs,” which dramatically improves proof performance and allows proving a much wider class of statements than just range proofs. Many startups have jumped on this and it’s being taken into the enterprise space by the likes of Silicon Valley startup Chain.  Among banks, though, the best known implementation of zero-knowledge proofs is in JPMorgan Chase’s Quorum, which was showcased to a rapturous reception on the blockchain circuit last year.  Taking the Quorum model a step further, ING designed its range proofs to be computationally less onerous than previous zero knowledge deployments and so faster to run on distributed ledgers.  “Zk-SNARKs, used in JPM Quorum, are known to be less efficient than the construction of zero knowledge proofs for a specific purpose, as is the case of zero-knowledge range proofs. Indeed, range proofs are at least an order of magnitude faster,” said Gomez de la Villa.  At JPMorgan, the Quorum team was led by Amber Baldet, who has since left to join a yet-to-be named startup. Now the word on the street is that JPMorgan is considering spinning out Quorum so it’s not longer under the direct purview of the Wall Street giant, in a possible bid to gain more of a network effect from other banks.  In that context, Gomez de la Villa assured CoinDesk the work her blockchain team is doing has the full blessing of ING’s top brass.  “I recently had a meeting with [ING CEO] Ralph Hamers together with the full board, and it was really nice to see that they are interested in hearing what the blockchain team is doing, and how we are doing it,” she said, concluding:  “I think we are way more comfortable and way more supported internally by the organization.”  ING Bank branch image via Shutterstock.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | ZEC,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/04/30/banking-giant-ing-is-quietly-becoming-a-serious-blockchain-innovator,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d2c88f3ab3f807df0b0119c2ab98ad557570845f-1500x909.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Details about the system's progression toward production launch were included in an 87-page consultation paper published Friday, which included a timeline for when the switch will be made as well as descriptions of the types of functions it will and won't support.  ASX is targeting a rollout date sometime in the quarter of 2020 or the first quarter of 2021. But before then, ASX – by way of the consultation paper – is seeking early feedback on its plans as they exist today.  ""Depending on the extent of consultation feedback received, ASX expects to provide a final functional scope and implementation roadmap in late July 2018,"" the firm explained in the opening of the report.  ASX has been exploring the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) since 2015. It announced in December that it would become the first major stock exchange in the world to use DLT for post-trade settlement, using technology developed in partnership with Digital Asset, a blockchain startup led by former JPMorgan Chase executive Blythe Masters. ASX also owns a stake in Digital Asset.  ASX's embrace of DLT is a notable one, coming at the end of a years-long research period. Speaking at the Synchronize conference in New York City earlier this month, CLS Group CEO David Puth said ASX's move is ""going to establish standards by itself"" by providing an example for enterprise blockchain implementations across the sector.  ASX deputy CEO Peter Hiom, who was on stage with Puth, suggested that the decision to launch a DLT-based system would help demystify the technology for others in the industry:  ""You're not entering the fourth dimension,"" he remarked.
