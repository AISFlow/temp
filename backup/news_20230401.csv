42412457,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4ysg,1680376596,"Arbitrum’s First Governance Proposal Turns Messy, With $1B ARB Tokens at Stake","The Arbitrum blockchain’s first attempt at governance erupted Saturday over a proposal to give the Arbitrum Foundation control of 750 million ARB tokens, worth nearly $1 billion.  Those tokens would fund a “special grants” program meant to foster growth on Arbitrum, the Ethereum layer 2 blockchain that airdropped its governance token ARB just last week. But ARB holders would not get a say in to whom or how Arbitrum Foundation allocates the nearly $1 billion sum, according to the proposal, AIP-1.  That’s because the centralized Arbitrum Foundation would not need to subject its grant allocations to “full on-chain governance” – the process by which ARB holders shape the blockchain and its ecosystem.  Arbitrum Foundation’s proposed backdoor stands in contrast to other elements of AIP-1 that underscore the claimed importance of token holders. “As Arbitrum is intended to be a public good, it is only right that governance over it should be governed by those for whom such public good is intended for,” read one section.  The vote, which is currently in a preliminary stage before heading for a formal final forum, comes before the Arbitrum Foundation has released key elements of how it will administer the grants program.  “We're talking about $1 billion to start,” said an Arbitrum community member who asked not to be named. “Having seen other governance examples where large treasuries got basically drained for community pet projects, this is pretty concerning.”  The organization that submitted the proposal, Lemma Ltd, could not be immediately reached for comment.  According to the proposal, the “special grants” program’s fast track would stop grants proposals from gunking up governance channels. It would also solve “voter fatigue,” the proposal said. That argument didn’t find favor with the community members CoinDesk interviewed.  “News flash: governance is hard,” one said, but that “doesn't mean you should circumvent due process. Elections are f****** annoying but democratic nations at least pretend to do them for a reason.”  Arbitrum token ARB fell about 7% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.",NEGATIVE,ARB,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | ARB,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/01/arbitrums-first-governance-proposal-turns-messy-with-1b-arb-tokens-at-stake,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/581221a988656b42b26dda77be554f319bcf1595-3202x1801.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421267,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnmN3,1680364979,"Balaji Srinivasan’s $1M Bitcoin Bet Could Be Right, but I Hope He’s Wrong","""Deutsche Bank share slide reignites worries among investors"" was the BBC headline when everything clicked. It added to the increasingly worrying set of events that have affected the global banking system over the past few weeks: another sign that we may be at the dawn of the Great Financial Crisis 2.0. Except this time we know the playbook, because the major commercial banks are too big to fail and governments will bail them out.  Peter McCormack is the creator and host of the What Bitcoin Did podcast and chairman of the Real Bedford football club.  That the U.S. government's debt is at unsustainable levels is neither here nor there, we know that this type of problem is one that politicians are willing to kick down the road. For politicians the present objective is always to maintain voter confidence and, thus, power. The yo-yoing between rate hikes to protect against inflation and the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing program to protect the banks isn't designed to resolve the United State's primary, systemic issue: expenditure significantly exceeding income. Instead, it seems the Fed and U.S. Treasury Department are working overtime to protect the dollar's position as the global world reserve currency.  These bandages aren't sterile and carry a threat of hyperinflation. As a result, the global economic system looks set for a historic correction at some indeterminate point in the near future.  A common question within the Bitcoin community is whether the fear of imminent hyperinflation is drawing investment back into bitcoin. Is bitcoin's recent price rise confirmation that the inflation hedge thesis, which many commentators have dismissed, is back in play?  Linking cause and effect in markets is a fool's errand, particularly for someone who interviews experts but doesn't profess to be one. But heck, let's give it a go.  First, why did the inflation hedge thesis lose credibility? Well, people saw inflation rising rapidly in late 2021 and early 2022, just as bitcoin's price quickly fell. Ergo, bitcoin wasn't an inflation hedge. Many critics of Bitcoin enjoyed carping about this, and the tl;dr of all of their articles and interviews was ""I told you so."" But some bitcoiners, such as Steven Lubka, held to their conviction. We were experiencing price inflation due to systemic supply chain shocks caused by various factors, particularly the world reopening following COVID-19. There was no monetary inflation, and so, the idea that bitcoin could act as a lifeboat amid the devaluing of the U.S. dollar could still hold true.  Further, bitcoin's price declined partly because of the unwinding of fraud and leverage from the likes of FTX, Celsius Network, Terra and others. Bitcoin took a hit as the world lost faith in cryptocurrencies, but perhaps only temporarily before we relearn the value of, and differences between, a hard money asset like bitcoin and other investments.  Bitcoin's price rises  So, what about bitcoin's recent price rise, is that linked to monetary inflation? Bitcoin's valuation rebounded sharply around Jan. 9. At the time, the Federal Reserve was planning another interest rate hike. There was talk of cooling inflation, continued ""quantitative tightening"" and bitcoin's rise being a dead cat bounce.  While various experts on my show have set out the significant systemic risks to the financial system, I don't think people investing in bitcoin at the beginning of the year were predicting an imminent economic slump requiring a new round of money printing. Maybe it was a January mirage, but while the economy displayed signs of distress, the worst case analysts predicted was a short recession.  My view at the time was bitcoin's new year price appreciation was a recoil from the maddening drama of 2022. Many believed bitcoin's price had found a bottom, and it was a good time to invest.  See also: Crypto and the Boom and Bust Cycles of Macroeconomics  In contrast, the rise in bitcoin's price beginning early March feels different. Among the largest banking failures in U.S. history, Silicon Valley Bank may require $2 trillion of new money from the Fed. Add to that the demise of Credit Suisse, one of the world's oldest banks centered in the nexus of the world's banking system, and the recipe was there for people to seek an exit from the U.S. dollar.  Experts don’t know  The current banking crisis has those without their heads in the sand trying to understand it all.  Take the two former significant political figures who front one of the U.K.'s most popular podcasts (""The Rest is Politics""). One of the hosts, who had previously run to become prime minister, relayed a discussion he’d had with a senior banker, who admitted that “these banks are so big, so complicated that nobody understands them. Literally nobody.”  Then there's the Biden administration’s recent “Economic Report of the President,” which stated: “[S]overeign money does not have a fundamental or intrinsic value.” That’s a hell of an admission. In other words, the U.S. dollar is based on confidence, and when confidence starts to ebb, as we’ve seen in previous crises, this can quickly turn into a flood.  Famous stock market crashes are just that – a sudden and abrupt crash from a high to a low. As investment analyst Lyn Alden stated in her recent newsletter, “$17.6 trillion in deposits are backed up by just $3 trillion in cash, of which perhaps $0.1 trillion is physical cash.” That touch paper just needs to be lit.  I don’t buy bitcoin today for what might happen tomorrow, I buy bitcoin today for what might happen in 2033.  In a press conference last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested the merger between UBS and Credit Suisse had seemed to have gone down well with the markets, but ominously qualified his statement by adding “so far.” When people like Powell, who are supposed to exude confidence and not mince words, express uncertainty about the current banking turmoil, it’s reasonable to suggest that savvy investors also see the danger and seek safe havens.  As we write this, the tables have turned slightly: bank shares have rebounded, and bitcoin’s price climb has stalled. But this seems like a temporary short-term adjustment in the context of a longer-term trend: fiat currencies are inflating away, and bitcoin, subject to state acceptance, is a viable alternative. That won’t stop haters from commentating on the sidelines, but bitcoiners are well-versed in blocking out such noise.  Bitcoin’s base characteristics  Those aware of bitcoin's properties – such as its limited supply and resistance against being seized – before the banking crisis were ahead of the curve. You can argue about what causes market movements, but in the two weeks since Silicon Valley Bank failed, bitcoin rose 37%. Such a rise in value of a scarce asset as quantitative tightening was being brought to an abrupt end, tells an obvious story.  None of this should be a surprise. Being a reliable store of value is one of the primary value propositions of bitcoin. As Satoshi stated: ""The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.""  But even Satoshi was no Nostradamus; he was an economic historian and inventor. He understood the root issues within a fractional reserve system and built a tool to protect those furthest from the spigot. His bitcoin design was based on simple core principles – scarcity, a fixed monetary policy and auditability. And these simple core principles brought trust back into the realm of money, in a trustless system, with fair, transparent rules everyone has to follow.  Bitcoin has never been a real-time solution to the problem of inflation. Like Michael Burry's famous bet on the housing market, it has rewarded those who prepare early for financial chaos. Time the market right, and you will perfectly hedge inflation, but if you ignore the warning signs and wait too long, then unlucky sucker.  As an inelastic monetary asset, bitcoin goes through its own cycles of fear and greed. Therefore those who did not listen to the warnings from their weird bitcoin friends but instead FOMO'd in as BTC sets new highs have found themselves underwater when the asset became overbought. Those who sensibly invested in bitcoin during periods of calm while the financial system overextended itself have found themselves protected when the money printer goes brrrr.  Are you too late for bitcoin? Unlikely. Will there be further problems in the economy? No doubt. Will this lead to further bailouts? You bet. Will bitcoin benefit? Highly likely. In fact, bitcoin's store-of-value properties are resonating again with investors considering how to navigate these troubled times. Could the economic situation get bad very quickly? Quite possibly, but who knows; the financial system is chaos theory writ large. Predictions fail, repeatedly.  We all sense that the system will hit the wall at some point. However, as Custodia bank founder Caitlin Long said to me recently: ""We just don't know when it is."" It could be today, next week, next year or in 2033. I don't buy bitcoin today for what might happen tomorrow. I buy bitcoin today for what might happen in 2033.  Enter Balaji  When the economic situation does deteriorate quickly, what will the impact on bitcoin be? Balaji Srinivasan recently wagered that bitcoin would reach $1 million by June 17. That’s June 17 this year. I’ll be honest, I’m not sure of the actual trading mechanics required to enable a sudden massive increase in valuation, but it would require significant capital inflows into bitcoin at a time when the institutions are choking the on-ramps.  It is evident, however, more people are being drawn in by bitcoin’s gravity as they grow increasingly tired of fiat’s fragility. Further, the people who need bitcoin are accessing bitcoin. There is adoption by communities in the developing world and on the periphery of the developed world, those suffering most from failing or collapsed currencies. While the use of stablecoins is also increasingly widespread in these locations, the populations seem to be rapidly developing the necessary technical skills to shift to bitcoin as and when required. Bitcoin, for many, is already a hedge against fiat currencies, including U.S. dollar proxies.  See also: Bitcoin's Censorship-Resistance Was a Step Change in History | Opinion (2021)  Either way, my concern, like many bitcoiners is that we’re still not ready for a world where Balaji’s prediction is proven correct, and if he is right, we have much bigger problems to worry about. Bitcoin’s adoption is still not wide enough to protect enough of those who most need it, or protect the Bitcoin network itself from government attack (assuming it becomes a target because of capital flight). Yes, the network will keep producing blocks, but choking the network feels like a more predictable attack now than accumulating hashrate.  Hedge your ignorance  The idea that bitcoin is an inflation hedge is ridiculed in the West; this includes my home country of the U.K., where people are still generally ignorant of bitcoin. They either know very little or have a tainted impression, so they view it with suspicion or dismiss it as money for criminals. To know and understand bitcoin is to gain new awareness that there is an alternative version of money. Nocoiners must cross a chasm of knowledge accumulation that we should not underestimate.  It's not hyperbolic to state that many people can clearly distinguish their life before and after understanding bitcoin. However, trying to explain how profound this realization is to others in developed countries runs the risk of sounding like someone who's been drawn into a cult! People respond with raised eyebrows and dismissive gestures.  Many people seem as ignorant of the serious risks to the economic system as they are of bitcoin. Few are willing to put their wealth in a scarce asset, even if they can see what type of economic catastrophe lies ahead. None of this invalidates the thesis that bitcoin is an inflationary hedge, it just reflects that changing a paradigm – particularly one protected by a strong self-interested centralizing force – takes time.  Bitcoin has a growing range of societal roles: freedom money, internet money, money for enemies and energy buyer of first and last resort.  A change in inertia requires a dramatic force from the outside, something that shocks the mainstream narratives. Bitcoin was born in a crisis, and it may take another crisis, or many more, to get most people to understand why they need a store of value and why they should consider bitcoin. Whether by design of accident, the four-year halving cycle might be bitcoin's inbuilt marketing device. When these halving cycles align with an economic crisis, we build ""adoption by a thousand cuts.""  Therefore, my primary concern is whether bitcoin will be used as an inflation hedge by those most in need of it in the world. A hedge requires understanding, forethought and planning, and, in my opinion, too many people are missing the warning signs, like the frog chilling in his lovely warm pan of water.  Sadly, those who benefited most from the Cantillon effect may be better placed to benefit from exploiting bitcoin's store of value utility than those who, time and again, bear the brunt of financial mismanagement. A large proportion of people bitcoin is supposed to protect will be cast adrift.  Better luck  Further education is required, and I am excited to be part of that process. However, as Bitrefill's Sergej Kotliar said to me recently, it is highly unlikely that we're going to Orange Pill everyone. His thoughts on growing adoption are much more pragmatic: appeal to people's needs and market the Bitcoin network's technical utility. ""Bitcoin is both a tool and a movement,"" he said.  Like the internet before, widespread tech adoption occurs due to the practical benefits provided to users. People have prosaic day-to-day concerns, and we have to appeal to their current needs, not just the fear of unknown forces. For example, selling bitcoin's use as a faster and cheaper payments rail (aka internet money). Given time, this can be another way to get people to adopt bitcoin, and where its sound money functions come as a bonus.  But it's much more than that. The beauty of bitcoin is that it has a growing range of societal roles: freedom money, internet money, money for enemies and energy buyer of first and last resort. All of these have massive positive societal ramifications. The role of educators is to understand the concerns of different audiences and market the heck out of bitcoin using selective arguments that resonate best with each. Sometimes this will be ideological, and sometimes this will be technical, and sometimes both.  Or to put it as succinctly as Margot Paez: ""Bitcoin adoption is going to struggle if we don't have the right ambassadors."" If bitcoin is for everyone, we need a range of people representing wider society to advocate for bitcoin.  See also: Should I Keep My Money in Bitcoin or a Bank? | Opinion  So, the question in my mind is not whether bitcoin and the inflation hedge thesis can be linked; they obviously are. In a world increasingly beset by trust issues, the best asset is one predicated on known and immutable scarcity, validated by a trustless, decentralized system.  No, the main question in my mind is how can we facilitate the transition to as broad a level of adoption as possible.  Slow and steady adoption would be better than a short sharp shock. The latter has significant risks: widespread value destruction, people embittered by those who hold bitcoin and the risk of government forfeiture. And obviously, it is better to keep bitcoin ahead of a crisis than to learn about it amid a crisis.  Therefore, let's hope that bitcoin's value doesn't reach $1 million in the next few months and that growth continues at a steady rate.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Peter McCormack,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/04/01/balaji-srinivasans-1m-bitcoin-bet-could-be-right-but-i-hope-hes-wrong,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/312f3dc3563b6ab686ea53fbec9d85fe4b64e384-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

What Might Be Driving The Current Rally Several factors are currently driving Cardano’s bullish momentum. Here are the latest developments on the network. Cardano’s New Wallet Feature Cardano is set to become a top blockchain network compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The developers intend to integrate a new feature enabling users to access EVM contracts directly from an ADA wallet. Cardano will be a top EVM chain next month Milkomeda (Cardano’s EVM layer) is launching a feature allowing EVERY Cardano user to use EVM contracts directly from ANY Cardano wallet All in pure ADA This will instantly make Cardano one of the largest EVM chains by user count pic.twitter.com/fp6WwdFmF4 — Sebastien Guillemot (@SebastienGllmt) March 30, 2023 A leading blockchain developer, Mikolmeda, announced this new upgrade noting that it will allow users to interact with dApps and smart contract services powered by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM. Users can do this comfortably without exiting the Cardano ecosystem. Also, it will enable Ethereum developers to build on Cardano’s network. Also, transactions and operations with the EVN contracts will use ADA rather than Ether, thus increasing the token’s utility. Milkomeda will also support staking activities for EVM users and integrate on-chain gaming. Cardano Foundation CEO Meeting With British Lawmakers Frederik Gregaard, CEO of Cardano Foundation, recently engaged influential policymakers in London with interest in UK’s blockchain future. He described the environment in the UK as an exciting time for blockchain. This month I visited London and met some of the truly passionate and involved policymakers and stakeholders invested in the future of #blockchain in the UK.

He stated that to become a global blockchain hub, UK policymakers must be ambitious in pursuing goals such as interoperability. Gregaard regards the London meeting as highly productive and looks forward to Cardano’s foundation’s support for blockchain development in the UK. Cardano Price Prediction ADA is trading in the $0.39 – $0.4 range today, gaining over 10% on its price in the past seven days. The recent developments on the network have given investors more reason to buy ADA tokens. It is trading above its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), a bullish signal for the long and short term. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) To Tap Into $30,000 Region Before A Slow Down, Here’s Why Cardano’s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is above its signal line and still rising, which is bullish. Also, the histogram bars reflect the bullish energy prevalent in the market. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 59.35, which is in the neutral zone and descending. It indicates that the bears are still active in the market, although they do not have sufficient pressure to reverse the trend.

District Judge Jennifer Rearden said she’d try and move quickly to settle a dispute, given that delays could cost as much as $10 million per month for the estate.  Earlier in March, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Michael Wiles approved the sale, but this week Rearden said she would put that on hold while she considered objections from the U.S. Attorney that the contract effectively rendered Voyager immune by exculpating it from breaches of tax or securities law.  Government arguments have “gone entirely unrebutted” by Voyager and its creditors, “neither of which has provided any authority for the proposition that a bankruptcy court can release criminal liability,” Rearden said.  In her further reasoning published Friday, Rearden appeared sympathetic to government arguments, saying that “the Exculpation Clause appears to go further than the quasi-judicial immunity doctrine allows.”  Binance's U.S. arm bid for Voyager last year after FTX, the previous bidder, itself collapsed. This week Binance’s global entity and its chief executive officer, Changpeng Zhao was sued by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for offering unregistered crypto derivatives. ​​Zhao said the suit is an “incomplete recitation of facts.”  Rearden has set a swift deadline to resolve the Voyager issue, with the government asked to send its brief by April 7 and a response by Voyager due by April 18.",NEGATIVE,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/01/us-government-case-against-voyager-binanceus-deal-has-substantial-merits-judge-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f8a842919a7c63ab857c829e645e19350980c7d4-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The process began earlier in the week and has seen more than 70% of the NFT holders move to Polygon in the largest migration between two blockchains. y00ts Migrates To Polygon Last December, DeLabs Studios, the company behind y00ts and DeGods, Solana’s flagship NFT collections, announced its intention to migrate to Polygon and Ethereum, respectively. At the time, the decision caused massive debate among holders as the collections were seen as distinct to the Solana ecosystem. However, DeLabs justified the action as a move towards making the collections the biggest in the crypto industry. In order to encourage holders to follow the migration process, DeLabs announced a full refund of network costs within the first 24 hours. Furthermore, holders received a reward of 5 USDC for each y00ts listed on Magic Eden and not having to pay any transaction fees on the collection for a month. Related Reading: Monero Price Stagnates, How Soon Will It Cross This Obstacle? The migration was expected not to affect the volumes on the Solana. However, the opposite has occurred in recent days. According to data from Magic Eden and OpenSea, about 11,600 NFTs out of the 15,000 y00ts collection had been migrated to Polygon. The floor price of 1.7 ETH represents about $36 million, making it the biggest migration of a collection of NFTs between two blockchains. The context of the migration has also come under scrutiny following news that Polygon paid $3 million grant to DeLabs Studio. However Rohun Vora, head of Delabs refuted this claim by insisting that several major companies – like Nike and Starbucks – have chosen Polygon. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) To Tap Into $30,000 Region Before A Slow Down, Here’s Why Solana Loses Ground In NFTs Race The migration of two of the biggest NFT collections from Solana is a major turning point in the NFTs war. Solana had previously been viewed by many crypto enthusiasts as the most likely to dethrone Ethereum as the leading NFT blockchain. Its low transaction fees and high scalability had been tabled as an alternative to Ethereum but the awaited flippening has yet to happen. This is because Solana has been plagued by network outages, processing problems and technical issues since its launch. In addition, the Solana Foundation was heavily backed by FTX and Alameda Research. The bankruptcy of the two entities has had a devastating effect on the blockchain and investors have gradually left the ship. The development of Layer-2 blockchains like Polygon and Arbitrium has made Ethereum attractive as users can launch NFTs for low transaction fees.

According to a report by blockchain tracker Whale Alert, Ripple transferred a total of 1 billion XRP tokens valued at $513.37 million out of its escrow account in the early hours of the day. Whale Alert states that this transfer occurred over three transactions, with Ripple releasing 500 million XRP worth $271. 05 million from an unknown wallet in the first transaction. Thereafter, 200 million XRP and 300 million XRP were released respectively from the wallet bringing the total transfer to 1 billion XRP tokens. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) To Tap Into $30,000 Region Before A Slow Down, Here’s Why The Ripple 55-Month Escrow Project Interestingly, this release of 1 billion XRP by Ripple is not a new or unusual event in the crypto space, as it occurs virtually every month. In 2017, Ripple released a statement laying out its intention to lock up 55 billion XRP tokens using the Escrow feature on the XRP Ledger. Ripple Labs explained that 1 billion XRP would be released monthly to incentivize investors and keep the interest around the token. At the start of 2018, Ripple began implementing its plan and has been consistently barring a two-month pause in October-November 2022. That said, it is worth stating that not all 1 billion XRP is left in circulation after release. A huge chunk of the newly released tokens, between 600-700 million XRP, are usually returned back to the Escrow wallet a few days after the release. Therefore, it is expected that a large portion of the latest XRP release will be captured from circulation in the next few days, perhaps before the end of next week.

XRP trading at $0.50556 | Source: XRPUSD chart on Tradingview.com However, looking at its broader performance, XRP has been one of the most impressive tokens in recent weeks. The altcoin has gained 19.2% in the last week and 32.4% in the last month. That said, XRP remains a hot topic in the crypto space due to the ongoing court case between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripples for issuing XRP, alleging the token was an unregistered security. Over the last two years, there has been a hot legal battle between both entities with many twists and turns. Although SEC has never lost a crypto lawsuit case, there is growing positive sentiment among investors that Ripple will emerge victorious when judgment is eventually passed – possibly this month. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.50, having gone down by 1.2% in the last hour. With a market cap value of $26.27 billion, XRP remains the sixth-biggest cryptocurrency in the market.

The advance has been due to a combination of factors, chief among them a renewed interest among investors in risky assets and growth areas such as technology stocks in the wake of shaken confidence in the traditional banking sector. Hopes of the Federal Reserve possibly ending its rate-hiking cycle have also helped sentiment. However, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) began the week on a negative note, as regulators continued to crackdown on cryptocurrencies and exchanges. The latest target was Binance, with the world's largest crypto exchange and its cofounder and CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao being sued by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on allegations of violating certain trading and derivatives rules. ""It's impossible to ignore cryptos at the moment given how they've traded throughout the banking mini-crisis, especially when you consider how directly crypto was impacted, and of course, all of the regulatory attention the industry has attracted,"" said OANDA analyst Craig Erlam. ""Bitcoin is slightly lower today but that doesn't really matter considering it remains around recent highs. As for where next, it's anyone's guess. Recent moves may not make sense to a lot of people and most explanations may be nonsense but you can never ignore the power of a crypto rally,"" Erlam added. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) briefly touched a 10-month high of ~$29.2K on Thursday. It traded within the $27.5K-$28.5K range this week. The total crypto market cap currently stands at $1.19T, an increase of 0.71% over Thursday, according to CoinMarketCap .
