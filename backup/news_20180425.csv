The other coins on the list are bitcoin, ethereum classic, zcash and Decentraland.  Speaking at the Stocktoberfest East conference in New York City, Digital Currency Group founder and CEO Barry Silbert asked audience members to raise their hands if they owned offshore bank accounts.  ""There is approximately 10 percent of the world's wealth held in offshore bank accounts,"" he said after some of the audience members raised their hands, adding:  ""I believe that financial privacy is going to become a really, really important thing not just in emerging markets, but in the U.S. as well.""  For this reason, Silbert said, privacy coins were one of Digital Currency Group's primary focuses. That category includes the relatively prominent zcash, of which the lesser-known ZenCash is a fork of a fork - via ZClassic.  ""I love the team,"" Silbert said of ZenCash Wednesday, ""I love the vision, and the community that we've gotten to know is incredibly passionate.""  He explained that the privacy coin is ""broader"" than its grandparent zcash, referring to its support for messaging and media applications.  Silbert said that ZenCash formed part of Digital Currency Group's ""conviction list,"" meaning that the firm has ""meaningful dollars in a token.""  Despite his enthusiasm for certain digital assets, however, Silbert made it clear that the space as a whole is rife with soon-to-be flops.  ""Most of the tokens are going to zero,"" he said.

Cisco submitted a patent application back in September 2015 for a ""Crowd-sourced cloud computing"" system, according to information from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The patent outlines how computer owners may be able to offer up their unused processing power for certain processes – including the energy-intensive mining process.  The filing describes how a user could partition their resources to create dedicated computing power for a cloud application. The cloud application would then be used for various purposes, Cisco notes, going on to explain:  ""This model is suitable for, among other things, offering distributed processing and services that can be optimized for speed, volume, scale and resiliency, cost, and regulatory compliance--for example, distributed neighborhood theft protection systems, or cluster, city or municipality county relevant services... One such case involves bitcoin mining, which may be very computational intensive and is typically more convenient for every participant when done in 'mining pools.'""  Cisco touts the benefits of distributed processing in the filing, noting that its system could be easily scaled and would be resilient against certain forms of attack. Further, ""the service provider can use geographic distribution to offload or optimize network loading, as well as to resell large-scale, low-cost computing and storage capacity,"" the company notes.  As previously reported, Cisco is one of a number of enterprise technology firms researching applications of blockchain, particularly in the area of connected devices or the Internet of Things.

42428977,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLqxhh,1524678358,US Congressman: 'Race to Regulate' Won't Solve Crypto Fraud,"Though fraud is undoubtedly an issue in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, U.S. Congressman Patrick McHenry believes lawmakers shouldn't rush to impose new regulations.  ""It's my fear that Congress and other policymakers get wrapped up in the hype of bitcoin and feel like doing something – anything – is better than nothing,"" he told CoinDesk in an interview on Tuesday, adding:  ""And I get it, there's fraud, there are bad actors, there's irrational hysteria in the space, but a race to regulate is not the answer.""  The North Carolinian Congressman's comments echo those made by fellow Republican Rep. Tom Emmer last month at an event in Washington, D.C., but diverge from those offered by his colleagues on the House Capital Markets, Securities and Investment Subcommittee.  During a March hearing on initial coin offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrencies, California Rep. Brad Sherman memorably dubbed cryptocurrencies a ""crock,"" while Michigan Rep. Bill Huizenga declared: ""This panel, this Congress is not going to sit by idly with a lack of protection for investors.""  McHenry said in the interview that such hastiness could stifle the innovative potential of the blockchain industry.  ""I think there's such a great opportunity around this technology that I think we have to be open to it and we have to have federal regulation and law that respects it,"" he explained.  Hold off on new laws  Likewise, McHenry said he thinks the existing regulatory approach is working, and that it is unlikely that Congress will need to develop entirely new laws for the industry in the future.  Instead, he suggested, existing rules should be aligned with new technology.  ""I think we need to take a comprehensive look at the ways this emerging technology already fits within our regulatory structure that exists today before we look at new regulations or new laws that might be needed,"" McHenry explained.  Regulators like the SEC have already exemplified this with their enforcement actions, he said, noting: ""There's a structure there already and an existing law that enables them to do that.""  For now, McHenry suggests that Congress should focus on learning about blockchain, cryptocurrencies and their use cases.  As for the latter, he is particularly excited about blockchain applications to the areas of crowd-funding and payments, for which the technology ""solves an enormous issue.""  ""Those two things are just fantastic opportunities,"" he told CoinDesk. ""But there's so many new use cases that it's hard to keep tabs on.""

42428961,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLqxLh,1524671503,Crypto Exchanges Pause Services Over Contract Bugs,"As many as a dozen or more ethereum-based ERC-20 smart contracts have been found to contain bugs that let attackers create as many tokens as they want.  While the bugs – first identified on April 22https://peckshield.com/2018/04/22/batchOverflow/ and April 24https://peckshield.com/2018/04/25/proxyOverflow/, respectively, in a pair of posts published by blockchain security firm PeckShield – aren't tied to the ERC-20 standard itself, the issues prompted a number of exchanges to suspend ERC-20 tokens as they investigate. Those exchanges included OKEx, Poloniex, Changelly, Quoine and HitBTC.  Huobi.Pro  separately announced on April 25 that it had suspended all coins, but has since limited that to ERC-20-based tokens. As of press time, Poloniex has moved to reinstate services for ERC-20 tokens.  In one example, an attacker transferred a whopping 57.9 * 10^57 BeautyChain Tokens – as shown by transaction data on Etherscan – on April 22, a development that prompted the initial investigation into the issue.  ""Our study shows that such transfer comes from an 'in-the-wild' attack that exploits a previously unknown vulnerability in the contract. For elaboration, we call this particular vulnerability batchOverflow,"" PeckShield's post on the 22nd explained. ""We point out that batchOverflow is essentially a classic integer overflow issue.""  Countless coins  The batchOverflow post outlines how the batchTransfer function in a contract has a maximum number of tokens that can be sent in a transaction, adding that the value of the tokens being transferred must be less than the total number of tokens that were generated. However, the ""_value"" parameter – one of the two that determine the total number of tokens – can be manipulated, which would then change another variable, resulting in an attacker being able to create as many tokens as they'd like.  Further, the attacker can bypass the barriers in the contract which would normally ensure that a reasonable number of tokens are being transferred.  ""With amount zeroed, an attacker can then pass the sanity checks in lines 258–259 and make the subtraction in line 261 irrelevant,"" the post explained, noting:  ""Finally, here comes the interesting part: as shown in lines 262–265, the balance of the two receivers would be added by the extremely large _value without costing a dime in the the attacker’s pocket!""  While initial reports indicated all ERC-20 tokens may be impacted, the ""batchTransfer"" function is not part of the token standard.  The Medium post did not list the vulnerable projects, though it did note that the BeautyChain was the first project they discovered. In a sign of the seriousness of that bug, OKEx said on April 24 that it was rolling back trades on the BeautyChain Token.  The exchange also announced around that time that in light of the bugs, it was suspending desposits and withdrawals a project called SmartMesh trading due to ""abnormal trading activities."" PeckShield noted that this was possibly due to the proxyOverflow bug, which, like batchOverflow, is a classic integer overflow problem. Certain variables can be manipulated to spontaneously generate large amounts of tokens.  One Twitter user noted that an attacker created $5 octodecillion in SmartMesh tokens.  As one of the posts noted, the danger exists that someone can use a vulnerable cryptocurrency to manipulate prices in their favor by trading with bitcoin, ether or another trading pair.  Representatives for the BeautyChain and SmartMesh projects did not immediately respond to requests for comment. However, a statement on BeautyChain's website acknowledges the bug and states that trading will resume at an undetermined point in the future.  Similarly, SmartMesh announced that it would take steps to prevent price manipulation, saying:  ""The SmartMesh Foundation will take the equivalent amount of SMT to the counterfeit amount and destroy it to make up for the losses caused, and keep the total supply of SMT at the value of 3,141,592,653.""  Fabian Vogelsteller, the developer who first proposed the ERC-20 standard, told CoinDesk that the bugs ""just show that we need better best practices and tools to detect those mistakes.""

42428962,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLqxNh,1524667551,EOS Is Nearing An All-Time Price High,"EOS is reporting gains on a down day for the wider crypto markets and may soon rally to fresh all-time highs.  As of writing, the world's fifth largest cryptocurrency by market valuation is changing hands at $14.61 – up 7.6 percent in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.  Meanwhile, most other major coins are flashing red. For instance, bitcoin is reporting 1.2 percent drop, bitcoin cash and IOTA are down 12 percent each and names like ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), cardano and stellar are down at least 8 percent each.  The good news for EOS does not end here: it's also the biggest gainer among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap on a week-on-week basis.  EOS' 62 percent rally is backed by a notable 556 percent rise in daily trading volumes, indicating that strong hands are at play and the rally is here to stay.  It's worth noting that EOS rallied sharply in the run-up to the April 15 eosDAC airdrop and, more importantly, remained well bid after the event – something of a surprise since cryptocurrencies usually rally ahead of their airdrops and then drop in value afterwards.  This resilience could be associated with the significant interest within the investor community about the platform's mainnnet launch. Further, big names like Bitfinex, Huobi and Antpool are running as candidates to be EOS block producers (""supernodes"" that will support the mainnet) and that may have boosted the token's appeal.  Clearly, EOS is in the news for all the right reasons, so a rally to record highs cannot be ruled out. The technical chart (prices as per Bitfinex) also back up that possibility.  EOS daily chart        The high volume bull flag breakout (witnessed on April 11) signaled a bull market revival and opened the doors for a retest of the record high of $18.67. Accordingly, EOS rallied to $16.14 Tuesday – the highest level since Jan. 13 – before falling to $14.18 today.

42428970,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLqxZh,1524664801,Two Big Crypto Startups Are Out to Build One Universal Wallet,"If the future is to bring an endless variety of cryptocurrencies and tokens, the world will need a wallet that can hold them all.  Now, two of the most prominent startups in the sector are teaming up to entice developers to build just that. Announced Wednesday, decentralized internet startup Blockstack (through its venture capital fund, the Blockstack Signature Fund) and exchange platform ShapeShift are jointly offering a $50,000 bounty to the team or developer that makes the best open-source ""universal"" crypto wallet.  Contestants need to use Blockstack’s authentication, storage and encryption technology combined with ShapeShift’s API for token exchange. The goal is to build a wallet that supports almost any native token, even tokens that haven’t been created yet, before the deadline on June 29.  Xan Ditkoff, a growth partner at Blockstack and producer at Blockstack's Signature Fund, explained:  “We're super early in this space. There are undoubtedly winners that have yet to even appear yet. It’s important that a wallet can support digital assets that have yet to be created.""  Most cryptocurrency wallets only support at most a handful of tokens, forcing enthusiasts to juggle multiple wallets and sometimes keep their tokens on custodial platforms like exchanges.  The Jaxx wallet added ShapeShift support in 2016, although that wallet provider is known to have some security vulnerabilities. Plus, it can’t support all tokens the way this upcoming wallet aims to.  Hedging bets  Notably, the partnership says much about the changing demands of crypto consumers, as it grew out of Blockstack's concern that not supporting certain coins could cost developer interest.  ""You shouldn't be deterred from building on Blockstack just because your community's atomic unit of use, or wealth, or whatever, your token, isn't represented on our platform,"" Ditkoff told CoinDesk.  ""As soon as we came up with that idea, ShapeShift was an obvious partner. They've probably done the most of any project ... for users to hold, exchange and add new tokens,"" he continue.  The partnership also is good for ShapeShift's bottom line, since the platform will earn revenue whenever wallet users convert their tokens through the API.  ""Much like you don't have a website that serves all of the needs of an individual, you won't have a single wallet or decentralized application that serves all of the needs of an individual as well,"" a ShapeShift spokesperson said.  More broadly, in Ditkoff's view, sometimes cryptocurrency tribalism can create familiar silos centered around specific tokens. But cooperation between teams often produces more innovative results than niche experiments, he said.  Submissions won’t only be judged based on the quality of the code. Judges will also consider how easy the wallet’s code is to audit and use.  “We’d love to see other developers use this going forward,” Ditkoff said, concluding:  “This space, in general, is going to succeed, or it’s not. It’s not going to be a winner take-all-type thing.”  Crypto wallet image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/04/25/two-big-crypto-startups-are-out-to-build-one-universal-wallet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2d65cdd1aa99ffbfe2a2e0bf2ebe6b3d90d582c5-1500x993.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42428967,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLqxRh,1524657623,Compliant Airdrops Are Here: CoinList to Offer Investors Free Crypto Giveaways,"Who'd have thought giving something away could be so complicated?  That's the question crypto innovators have had to come to terms with since the concept of ""airdrops"" – or the practice of gifting tokens in massive giveaways – has come under the scrutinyhttps://www.sec.gov/news/headlines/webstock.htm of government regulators.  But with the launch of a new product Wednesday, CoinList, an initial coin offering (ICO) facilitator spun out of the renowned startup incubator AngelList, is looking to streamline the process of airdrops in a way that doesn't run afoul with the law.  Aptly named Airdrops, the product runs users through compliance checks and attestations so that a token issuer can give CoinList's users free tokens. On top of that, if the issuer is looking for users that meet certain criteria (be it a profession or location), they can verify that users actually fit those backgrounds.  In this way, CoinList CEO Andy Bromberg believes he has found a way to enable airdropped offerings at a time when many in the industry are looking for a compliant service. Token issuers themselves have had no shortage of issues here, with some, including video-monetization service Stream, even backing off the concept altogether because of the regulatory uncertainty.  Indeed, the SEC hasn't taken a formal stance on how it views crypto tokens delivered through ICO, airdrops or other forms of sales and giveaways, but it's clear regulators are currently investigating that question.  Still, Bromberg is confident in his assembled solutions, and in interview, he hinted at dialogue with regulators that would attest to the viability of the service.  ""In our typical compliance first mindset, we sat down and said: Is there a way to pull this off without violating securities laws? And what we came to is the compliant Airdrops product,"" Bromberg told CoinDesk.  He continued:  ""I can't comment on individual discussions with the SEC. What I can say is we are in frequrent communication with them and — based on our understanding of securities law — we are very comfortable with this.""  Not only does the startup believe it has a solution for working under existing securities law, but it's also opening up its existing user base of past investors to new token issuers. Once users have gone through the company's compliance flow, they will be verified to receive airdrops, and CoinList will take a nominal fee from users (less than $1 per airdrop) to accept new tokens.  To date, according to a CoinList spokesperson, it has facilitated more than $400 million worth of token sales through its platform, representing what could be a vast pool of people interested in investing and taking part in future crypto tokens.  Compliance as a service  While that pool of potential investors will likely be attractive for token issuers, Coinlist's product is opt-in – a feature added to reduce spam and mitigate the security threats that have become a common annoyance from crypto enthusiasts involved in such offerings.  Also, CoinList says it's only willing to work with token issuers that are focused on complying with the law. And that's partly because CoinList will be promoting these projects for issuers.  Still, CoinList's Airdrops product seems to be set up whereby all the compliance effort is offloaded from the issuer, which many issuers will like since many are not securities law experts.  CoinList's product allows for airdrops that might fall under Regulation S and Regulation D and will also collaborate with AngelList spin-off Republic, which has a license to sell securities under limited conditions to non-accredited investors using Regulation CF.  The company is also doing a country-by-country analysis to determine what sorts of checks issuers will need to do in order to airdrop to users around the world.  Depending not only on the goals of the issuer and who they want to give to, different levels of know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements will be needed, and whether issuers can to both accredited and unaccredited investors or one or the other.  And all of this has already proven enticing to token issuers. Bromberg told CoinDesk the company is in negotiations with more than one issuer to use its Airdrops product but declined to disclose which ones.  While CoinList has so far been focused on fundraising, Bromberg said that potential issuers will not have to have a token sale on the platform in order to use the new product.  ""We're interested in exploring this model where in some cases ... funding might be separate from distribution,"" Bromberg said.  The right recipients  Still, different companies might have very different goals for an airdrop, and Bromberg gave two examples of use cases he believes could work well.  For example, he said a company with a token it believes regulators will recognize as a utility token, something used primarily to access a certain service, can use CoinList to get it in the hands of people who are likely to be the most interested.  This issuer might target software developers, and in this case, CoinList would enable them to authorize the airdrop to check a users Github API and distribute to developers with a certain commitment frequency.  Getting the tokens in the hands of people who will ultimately use the token as intended ""will help that network get to a place where that token is no longer a security,"" Bromberg said.  Still, there could also be companies that want to issue securities, Bromberg said: ""A company could tokenize some of their equity and give that equity, give those tokens, to early users on the product.""  As such, CoinList will also offer a wide array of ways to authenticate users as meeting certain objectives, be it a certain audience on Twitter, a certain location in the world or a certain occupation. It can use APIs off other websites to verify these target goals to insure that an airdrop recipient meets them.  Because it is running KYC/AML checks on all of them, it also verifies that each user receives a token allocation only once. ""It prevents gaming the system,"" Bromberg said.  It's an approach designed for an excess of caution, but one that's also ready to adapt.  ""Whether or not these things are securities, we are treating them like securities to be as safe as possible,"" Bromberg said. To that end, some startups have been meeting with the SEC to ask for what's called a no action letter, a document that says regulators believe a given company has not violated securities law.  If something like that comes to pass, CoinList is confident enough that the platform is ready for that, too.  Bromberg concluded:  ""We'd be open to airdropping without the compliance layer.""

The cryptocurrency rose to $9,767 on Bitfinex earlier today – the highest level since March 12 – before falling back to $9,100. As of writing, bitcoin (BTC) is changing hands at $9,125.  The 6.8 percent drop from the intraday highs signals bullish exhaustion near the gradually ascending (bullish biased) 200-day moving average (MA) at $9,835. Furthermore, the 4-hour chart below shows scope for a deeper pullback ahead.  4-hour chart  The indicated bearish engulfing candle (price action engulfed previous 4-hour candle's high/low) also suggests bullish exhaustion.  Meanwhile, the relative strength index (RSI) index has dipped below the double top neckline support, signaling that BTC will likely find acceptance below the ascending trendline support and drop toward the 50-day MA, currently located at $8,654.  Note, the 50-day, 100-day and 200-day MAs are sloping upwards and aligned one below the other in favor of the bulls. So, a drop below $8,650 will likely be short-lived.  Only a close (as per UTC) below the ascending 10-day MA would signal short-term bullish invalidation.  Daily chart  The above chart shows the 5-day MA and 10-day MA are trending north, also indicating a short-term bullish setup.  Bitcoin witnessed a convincing break above the long-term descending trendline on April 20 and is currently trading well above the trendline support. So, the long-run outlook as indicated by a number of factors remains bullish.  View  Bitcoin remains on the hunt for a bullish break above the $10,000 mark.  There is a risk of a pullback to $8,650–$8,600 in the short-term.  Only a close below the ascending 10-day MA at $8,671 would abort the short-term bullish view.

42428965,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLqxTh,1524652253,Bitcoin Miners Arrested for Alleged Power Theft,"Allegations of electricity theft have led to the arrest of bitcoin miners in two Chinese cities, according to reports.  In the first instance, six individuals have been arrested in Tianjin, with the Xinhua news agency saying the suspects allegedly used 600 cryptocurrency miners to generate bitcoin with power taken from the local power grid. The police claimed they avoided paying the resulting bills by bypassing the electricity meter.  An investigation was launched, Xinhua says, after the local power company noticed spiking electricity consumption while detecting a significant difference from the measured current. That ultimately led to the seizure of the 600 bitcoin miners along with eight high-powered fans.  The case, coming at a time when China still plays a dominant role in bitcoin mining despite hints it might move to dampen the industry, marks the largest power theft in the country in recent years, the report states.  Meanwhile, according to another report today from the official news sitehttp://news.jcrb.com/jszx/201804/t20180425_1862013.html of China's supreme prosecutor, two suspects have also been arrested by police in the city of Wuhan – also charged with electricity theft.  The individuals had allegedly been using an empty and discarded warehouse since March 2017 to house bitcoin miners, while avoiding utility bills via a similar method to the Tianjin accused.

42428981,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLqxrh,1524648625,#MeToo Movement Turns to Ethereum to Evade Censorship,"Inspired by the ""#metoo"" movement, students in China are coding messages onto the tamper-proof ethereum blockchain to escape Chinese internet censorship.  As Quartz reported on Tuesday, an anonymous address on the ethereum blockchain sent itself a transaction on April 23 holding code that contains the content of a censored open letter in order to permanently store the text in the public domain.  The open letter, written by Yue Xin, a female student from Peking University, described how she was treated by the university after presenting it with a petition to make public its investigation of a sexual harassment case alleged to have happened at the university 20 years ago.  The letter has now sparked support from others in China, who are also posting messages on the ethereum blockchain.  Members of at least three universities in the country appear to have coded their support into the blockchain in a bid to dodge censorship by the Chinese authorities that targets not only the original source, but also reposts that help disseminate the news.  ""Disappointed by the official statement of Peking University, hope PKU will not stand on the wrong side of this issue. Keep strong! – Anonymous, in Tsinghua University,"" reads one transaction that was later sent to the same anonymous ethereum address.  Meanwhile, members from China's Sun Yat Sen University and Xi'An Eurasia University have also apparently posted messages.  The messages read:  “We should not be silent – we are from Xi'an Eurasia University.”  And:  “We are willing to support you and we are from Sun yat sen University.”  According to a report from the New York Times on Tuesday, the case involved a faculty member named Shen Yang who had allegedly raped a female student at the time, which subsequently led to her suicide in 1998. Encouraged by the internationl #metoo movement, activists from Peking University, including Yue, recently sent a petition asking the university to investigate the case.  However, in her letter, Yue wrote how she had been forced by the university to scrap the petition and delete all relevant information alongside threats that she might not be able to graduate without complying. While she later published the letter, it and Yue's name were quickly censored by the authorities, the report says.  Although the ethereum blockchain has effectively permanently documented Yue's letter and the responses, China's most popular messaging app WeChat has blocked users from accessing the blockchain transaction page on etherscan.io that allows users to view the transactions. However, the etherscan.io website is still accessible through WeChat.

According to a report by Bloomberg published Wednesday, Binance's Zhao Changpeng is currently facing a lawsuit brought to the high court in Hong Kong by California-based venture capital firm Sequoia Capital.  Citing court documents dating back to March, the news source said the issue stems from a discussion of an injection of capital into the company last year when the platform was first launched.  As the talks continued, Zhao reportedly told Sequoia in mid-December – when the price of bitcoin hac surged to a record high of nearly $20,000 – that a proposed valuation of $80 million for an 11 percent stake in the firm would not match the expectations of the firm's shareholders.  However, as the deal fell through, the report said Zhao was also in talks with another potential investor IDG Capital, which expressed interest in investing in Binance over two funding rounds and evaluated the firm at $400 million and $1 billion, respectively. As such, Sequoia is accusing Zhao for breaching the claimed exclusivity agreement.  Bloomberg states that, although the firms planned to settle the matter in arbitration, Sequoia turned to the court to prevent Binance from talking to other potential investors.  The court in Hong Kong has reportedly ordered Zhao not to talk to other investors until a hearing can be held to rule whether Zhao is liable over the allegations.

The website has been tracking the price of bitcoin since 2014.  The new service will post real-time quotes for both the U.S. dollar and the euro – as well as historical price trends for the nine crypto-assets – using data from the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken.    ""It's no doubt that our readers, as the world's savviest investors, have an eye on digital currency and we're happy to be expanding our real-time tracking of a total of 9 cryptocurrencies in both euros and USD, with Kraken's help,"" Dan Shar, general manager at MarketWatch, said in a statement.

42428933,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLnAjh,1524625203,Ethereum Infighting Spurs Blockchain Split Concerns,"UPDATE: Since publication, major ethereum community members have expressed an interest in working to find solutions that would avoid an inability to reach consensus. These include principal players ParityTech, and key community members Golem Project and developer Peter Szilagyi, whose statements are linked.      Ethereum appears to be at a notable crossroads on technical direction.  At least, that was the mood at a meeting of top ethereum developers late last week where a discussion on a controversial code proposal called EIP 999 led some to speculate the scenario is now a possibility. Indeed, it's now believed the proposal, which which seeks a technical fix that would return $264 million in lost funds, is so contentious, some users may chose to defect to a new version of the code.  Those in favor of the proposal point to the frequent losses of ether due to buggy contracts, arguing that the platform should ensure against such avoidable mistakes. But on the other side, many warn that editing code after deployment could damage not only the security but also the integrity of the platform.  “It’s clear no matter where you stand that the issue is contentious enough that if [EIP 999] goes forward and implements then it will generate a contentious hard fork,” developer of ethereum’s Mist browser Alex Van de Sande, said during the dev meeting on April 20.  “It’s unavoidable that it will create a split,"" he continued.  Still, it's important to note the size and influence of its backers. Spearheading the code change, for instance, is Parity Technologies, the ethereum software company behind the wallet that was impacted by the fund freeze.  Founded by ethereum co-founder Dr. Gavin Wood in 2015, Parity is the second most popular ethereum software, used by almost one-third of the network.  Speaking at the meeting, two representatives from Parity, communications officer Afri Schoedon and co-founder and CEO of the company Jutta Steiner, urged client developers to move forward with versions of the software equipped with the EIP 999 change.  “For me, the most logical step to take is just implement EIP 999, and I don’t see what waiting another four weeks to conclude would benefit,” Schoedon said.  Steiner echoed this, emphasizing that implementing the code doesn't necessitate a split.  However, there was notable disagreement on the assertion. Péter Szilágyi, the lead developer of Geth, the Ethereum Foundation-led ethereum software which serves the majority of users, disagreed, stating that if the code is made available it is likely to create a contentious split.  Szilagyi said:  “We’re talking about exactly the same networks and we’re basically starting a tribalism war. I don’t think we’ll reach a consensus.”  Geth versus Parity  And the discussion, while informal, shows ethereum's two biggest competing softwares are willing to go head-to-head on the issue, a development that could prove notable going forward.  Stepping back, though, it's important to understand how Parity and Geth work together. Each software communicates directly with the ethereum virtual machine - which takes smart contract language and translates it into more general code - but Parity and Geth do so in different computer programming languages.  By keeping up with each other's development, both softwares remain in sync and on the same blockchain not only with each other but also with ethereum more broadly.  As such, it is critical that Geth and Parity contain the same code.  If, for instance, one team implements EIP 999 and the other does not, the blockchain could fracture into two divergent groups – two ethereums.  And just as the developers of the software implementations are split, so are ethereum users. An ether vote recentlyhttps://www.etherchain.org/coinvote showed that a majority of people were opposed to the code change, but that voting method has come under much criticism. Other developers are looking to social media to help them gauge community consensus, but so far, it remains inconclusive.  As such, Parity's Steiner said that the company “had not decided yet” whether to implement the change. But representatives from the company told CoinDesk that it would be publishing a statement in the coming days.  What is known, though, is that without Parity, ethereum would lose quite a bit.  Not only does the company provide a significant portion of the mining power that secures transactions on the network, but it also represents a large portion of ethereum's developer community.  Speaking to this and Parity's drive to hard fork so they retrieve user funds, Van de Sande told CoinDesk:  “Parity is a valuable team of developers, and they have a very large incentive to create a fork and support it.”  Dire disincentives  But even with an incentive to move forward with implementation, there are plenty of disincentives.  For one, if a split on ethereum occurs, it won’t merely impact transactions, but also the thousands of tokens and businesses built on top of the blockchain, Van de Sande said in a blog post.  Following a split, each ethereum contract will simultaneously exist on both chains, or as Van de Sande described, “If you own rare online cats, now every one of them will have an evil twin in a parallel universe.”  Speaking to CoinDesk, Van de Sande elaborated, saying, “The best case scenario for a split is one in which the minority fork is a very small community and most apps know which way to move forward, but it still might create an adversarial community.”  However, there is hope for disincentivizing Parity from going forward without full consensus, he said.  If a split occurs, it is likely that both ethereum blockchains will lose value as the community splits into two groups. This means that the money lost as a result of the Parity fund freeze will decrease in value.  “Since there is so much locked ether, that can amount to millions of dollars,” Van de Sande said. “Then they might not be so incentivized to fork it.""  Yet, that still doesn't eliminate the issue that hundreds of millions of dollars of ether are locked up whereby users (including some high-profile ICO issuers) can use them.  As such, Van de Sande is working on a method to refund the Parity losses with the same amount of value as was lost in the fund freeze, although he wouldn't go into much detail.  Instead, he told CoinDesk:  “The question is how to give value to those tokens, and that's something I, and I hope others, will probably be writing more about.”  Warning of shock sign via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | FORKS,Rachel-Rose O'Leary,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/04/25/ethereum-infighting-spurs-blockchain-split-concerns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c3b841b05bc923211cc45fe1c4ef58933608600f-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In an article published Tuesday on its website, the National Audit Office of the People's Republic of China discussed using blockchain to alleviate the bottleneck caused by its current data storage infrastructure. At present, the office is responsible for a massive amount of data, which it believes can be stored more efficiently on a decentralized ledger.  The National Audit Office, as one of the 29 cabinet-level departments in China's State Council, examines all government-related financial transactions, ranging from administration expenses to individual public programs. It also supervises provincial and municipal level auditing bureaus that have their own designated commissioners.  Envisioning a decentralized system that would have every local office and accredited auditor as an individual node, the article states that a blockchain can reduce the central government's workload while ensuring a traceable ledger that timestamps every transaction at all levels.  While still theoretical, the article offers a window into the thinking of a state-level government body in China regarding blockchain technology. It remains to be seen whether any work will actually go into developing this theoretical system.  According to the article, the need for decentralization stems from the existing operational model adopted by the central office, which is the only department that stores every piece of data reported by its commissioners at the provincial and municipal levels.  ""Since bureaus at these levels do not keep the data, the National Audit Office runs into the situation where we have to expand our software and hardware capacity indefinitely - which is a 'vicious circle,'"" the Office wrote, concluding:  ""The concept of blockchain and technology will offer us a window into solving [the] basket of problems mentioned above.""
