Clubs are restricted from selling “advertisements for specific cryptocurrencies, initial coin offerings, other cryptocurrency sales or any other media category as it relates to blockchain, digital asset or as blockchain company,” according to an anonymous team official reading from the guidelines to an Athletic reporter.  The policy allows for sponsorships with companies that mainly provide investment advisory or fund management services related to cryptocurrency, such as Grayscale Investments’ deal with the New York Giants. (Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.)  Players’ individual ventures appear to be excluded from the rule. Tampa Bay quarterback Tom Brady has an equity stake in FTX along with ownership of an NFT platform partnered with DraftKings.  The NFL has lagged behind other major leagues in entering the NFT space. The National Basketball Association has enjoyed a lucrative partnership with Dapper Labs’ NBA Top Shot dating back to May 2020, and Major League Baseball recently launched its own NFT marketplace with Fanatics-owned Candy Digital in July.

42376203,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwHZYl,1630701443,Market Wrap: Bitcoin and Ether Cross Milestones as Rally Continues,"Bitcoin is holding above $50,000 at press time and is up about 2% over the past week. Higher price moves in cryptocurrencies have coincided with a rally in global stocks this week, signaling greater appetite for risk among investors.  Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, reached $4,000 on Friday for the first time since May. ETH is up about 20% over the past week, extending its outperformance versus bitcoin.  “BTC wants to join the party, too,” Martha Reyes-Hulme, head of research at digital asset prime brokerage and exchange Bequant, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “Bitcoin dominance has been falling towards 40% and may gradually weaken as investors branch out to other areas of the market, focusing more on use cases than purely store of value,” Reyes-Hulme wrote. Bitcoin’s dominance ratio represents its market capitalization as a percentage of the overall $2.28 trillion crypto market.  If bitcoin fails to break above $50,000 resistance, a reversal could “take the price down to the low $40K levels and might as well indicate a dead cat bounce,” Ulrik Lykke, executive director at digital asset hedge fund ARK36, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $50,507, +2.4%  Ether (ETH): $3,944, +4.3%  S&P 500: -0.0%  Gold: $1,830, +1.1%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.324%  Risk rally continues  Bitcoin is up about 70% year to date compared to a roughly 20% rise in the S&P 500 over the same period. Gold and bonds have produced negative returns so far this year as investor appetite for risk continues following the coronavirus pandemic shock in March 2020.  Both equities and cryptocurrencies experienced relatively low volatility over the past few months, partly driven by the market’s expectation of continued monetary policy easing.  On Friday, the U.S. added 235,000 jobs, falling well short of the 725,000 projection. The jobs miss reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve’s stimulus program, known as quantitative easing (QE) could persist longer than expected and therefore boost asset prices. Bitcoin and stocks moved higher shortly after the jobs report.  Ether options premiums rise  Realized volatility for ether is starting to rise again after a flat August. Meanwhile, the cost to buy short-term ETH options is also rising, which could point to overheating.  Large-size call positions were spotted on Wednesday morning when ETH broke out of a monthlong range above $3,400, according to options data provider Skew. And technical charts suggest the rally is overbought, albeit less so compared to August.  The chart below shows ETH front-end risk reversals, the difference in implied volatility between similar call and put options, have flipped strongly to the put side.  “With the speed of this move higher, a sharp mean-reversion move would not be too surprising,” crypto trading firm QCP Capital wrote in a Telegram chat.  Solana enters the major league  Programmable blockchain Solana’s SOL token rallied to a new high on Friday near $145, replacing the meme-focused cryptocurrency dogecoin as the seventh-largest coin by market value.  SOL’s market capitalization jumped to $42 billion, surpassing dogecoin’s $38 billion market cap.  Since Solana launched the non-fungible tokens (NFT) project Degenerate Ape Academy on Aug. 15, the SOL token has tripled in price. The timing couldn’t have been better, given the ongoing NFT sugar rush, wrote CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole.  Altcoin roundup  Sotheby’s hosts “Bored Ape Yacht Club” (BAYC) NFT auction: The series of computer-generated monkey-themed avatars is expected to fetch between $13.5 million and $20 million during a two-lot online sale running Sept. 2-9. “The Bored Ape Yacht Club project is one of the most exciting and creative NFT collectible initiatives since the launch of CryptoPunks,” said Michael Bouhanna, a contemporary art specialist and co-head of digital art at Sotheby’s, in a statement. The BAYC collection was developed last spring by Yuga Labs and touts National Basketball Association star Steph Curry as a collector.

About 9.23 ETH are burned every minute due to the spike in the network fee. For days now, many Ethereum users have been complaining about the ridiculous gas fees which have rendered the network almost unusable for them. Due to the continuous frenzy in the non-fungible token (NFT) and DeFi market, Ethereum gas fees were spotted at an insane level today, which would cost nearly $500 to process a transaction on Uniswap. Users lament over spike in Ethereum gas fees As seen at 14:15 UTC today, the transaction fee for ERC-20 token transfers increased to $147.32 at low priority and $148.87 at high priority. It would also cost about $458 for token swaps and $400 to add/remove LP from the Ethereum-based decentralized exchange, Uniswap. The ridiculous increase in Ethereum gas fees is a result of the transaction load on the network, which is probably spurred by the rapid-growing amount of trades and activities on the DeFi and NFT market. Consequently, this is rendering the network unusable for many retail Ethereum users, since it&apos;s not profitable to pay more in fees just to process small transactions. These ETH Gas fees are insane.

Ethereum is the most important cryptocurrency to the ecosystem since the former&apos;s creation, and has recently stolen the show. On the ETH versus BTC trading pair, the recent market structure resembles an accumulation pattern moments before the liftoff phase. If the pattern is accurate, a market cap &apos;flippening&apos; could soon become a narrative that rivals the story of digital gold itself. Ethereum, Bitcoin, And Disrupting Digital Finance During the year 2020 and with the onset of the pandemic, all things digital became far more important to the global ecosystem - and no more notably than in finance. Among the other reasons for digital assets to thrive in the 2020-forward economy, was due to the abundance of fiat value being added to the balance sheets of the US Fed. Gold in theory should thrive in such a situation, but instead the world has turned to Bitcoin and its altcoin brethren as the up and coming store of value. As important as this changing of the guard has been for crypto overall - and the fact it could not have been done without Bitcoin - it is Ethereum that is breaking on through to the mainstream.

42376193,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwHZNR,1630696693,Loot Holders Get $51K AGLD Airdrop Because NFTs,"Despite being less than 48 hours old, a new currency is already emerging as a blockchain gaming powerhouse: adventure gold (AGLD) is riding the buzz of Loot, the latest non-fungible token (NFT) craze to captivate traders’ imaginations.  While AGLD currently has no playable game and no official development team, that hasn’t stopped traders from piling into AGLD – a token designed for a text-based NFT gaming project itself barely a week old. AGLD’s fully diluted market cap has climbed to $375 million at the time of writing, now rivaling big-budget blockchain games like Illuvium’s ILV and The Sandbox’s SAND in value.  Major exchanges have also jumped on the text-based fantasy NFT wagon, with crypto exchange FTX listing AGLD spot and derivatives trading just 30 hours after the launch of the currency.  Much like the original Loot project, the value accrual has been both torrid and questionable, with some speculating as to how high AGLD can fly and questions swirling as to if the open-source community rallying around Loot and AGLD can iterate fast enough to justify the stratospheric prices.  Buyers galore  Following last week’s release of NFT project “Loot (for Adventurers),” a host of related projects have sprung up as part of an ever-expanding fantasy “Loot-verse.”  Read more: The Latest NFT Fad Is a Text-Based Fantasy Game Building Block  The AGLD project might be the most successful yet, however. The fungible ERC-20 token was airdropped to Loot NFT holders, with each Loot NFT entitling a holder to 10,000 of the 80 million max AGLD supply.  The contract was created Wednesday night, and users quickly made and deposited into a liquidity pool on the Uniswap decentralized exchange.  The token has been astonishingly volatile since, with a 24-hour high of $7.70 and low of $1.24.  It currently trades at $5.10, meaning each Loot NFT entitles holders to $51,000 worth of tokens.  Additionally, on-chain sleuths detected significant institutional interest earlier on Friday. In a series of transactions, a wallet labeled by on-chain analytics firm Nansen as belonging to Alameda Research swapped over 355 ETH for AGLD worth over $1.4 million at the time.  Both FTX, the exchange that promptly listed AGLD futures, and Alameda Research were founded by Sam Bankman-Fried.  Utility?  In an interview with CoinDesk, AGLD creator Will Papper said he wrote the majority of the code “in four hours” at a small airport in Oregon.  “I launched it because I thought it was fun! To say that I didn’t expect this would be a significant understatement. I’m just a community member like anyone else,” Papper, who is also a co-founder of decentralized investing platform Syndicate, told CoinDesk via Twitter DM.  Much like Loot itself, AGLD is designed to be open-source and composable.  The token can function in governance, and users are already using it to vote on a “quest line” where decisions are made in a text-based game based on vote totals. Papper also said in a tweet thread that the token can be used to vote on “future in-game credits, or future mints that build on top of @lootproject and adopt $AGLD.”  Minting decisions and other governance proposals will be executed via contractual permissions given to a multisig group consisting of Papper and other community members. (Multisigs are shared addresses controlled by a group rather than one individual, meant to assuage concerns over a bad actor being able to abscond with user funds.)  Papper told CoinDesk the other signers are a “number of extremely reputable community members who love Loot” and that “we’ll announce the members in due time.”  “Some members were friends, others were recommended in the Discord. All have very strong reputations,” he wrote.  While Papper and his multisig cohort currently have centralized control over the currency, he made it clear that he wishes for the community to take the reins.  “I made $AGLD because I thought it was fun,” said Papper. “The rest is up to the community.”  Editor’s note: This reporter minted and subsequently sold Loot NFTs on the day of the launch.

Ethereum All Exchanges Taker Buy Sell Ratio Shoots Up As pointed out by a CryptoQuant post, the ETH all exchanges taker buy sell volume has shown a huge spike today. The Ethereum all exchanges taker buy sell ratio (or volume) is an indicator that shows the ratio between long volume and the taker seller volume. Now, common sense says, since every trade needs a buyer and a seller, how can there exist a difference between the two quantities? Well, to understand the concept of taker buy and sell volumes, the idea of taker and maker needs to be understood first. Quoting the CryptoQuant data guide: Taker: Taker trade refers to an order that is traded before going on the order book. All market order trades are takers. Maker: Maker trade refers to an order that goes on the order book (e.g. a limit order). These orders add volume to the order book, helping to &apos;make the market&apos;. When these takers buy ETH at the price set by makers, the amount of coins traded contributes to the taker seller volume. This volume is referred to as &apos;seller&apos; because it can drive the prices down.

Julio Patricio Supervielle, CEO of IOL parent Grupo Supervielle, said in the company’s second-quarter earnings call the trading app is working to allow customers to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, “concentrating stock and crypto-asset investments in the same platform,” he said.  Earlier this year, the fintech started highlighting bitcoin-related stocks, a proxy for investors who want exposure to the crypto sector without holding the coins themselves. PayPal unleashed a flood of fintechs after its October 2020 announcement that it would offer crypto buying and selling in partnership with custodian Paxos.  The IOL offering will be powered by a third party and extended to customers in Argentina at an unspecified date.  When reached by CoinDesk, IOL invertironline confirmed the details shared on the earnings call.  IOL plans to gradually expand to several Latin American countries – excluding Brazil – offering U.S.-based investment products, Supervielle said. As a first step, the company has requested authorizations to operate as an online broker in Uruguay.

42394436,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdYKZ,1630690457,The Value of NFTs Is Belonging,"The spending frenzy for Bored Apes, Cryptopunks, Pudgy Penguins and other “NFT communities” has sparked a parallel frenzy in futurism.  Commentators like Kevin Roose at the New York Times are pondering whether owning a unique avatar drawn from these digital art “drops” could manifest into a new, monetizable expression of a person’s online digital status – combining the social value of a Twitter check mark, perhaps, with the speculative value of a diamond ring. Others talk about how these new identities will build hierarchies in the metaverse, that online world to which we’re all supposedly migrating.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  To understand why this phenomenon inspires such futuristic visions, it’s also important to see what it takes from humanity’s past. We need to acknowledge that it taps into the deeply ingrained connection that art and iconography – from the Christian cross to Nike’s swoosh – have always had with the human need to belong.  I think this merging of the antique with the novel – applying that deep-seated connection between art and community to the new world of online markets in unique digital assets – is what gives this trend far greater prospects for economic disruption than initial coin offerings ever had. Add decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) into the mix, and that potential is amplified even more.  The semiotics of belonging  In my first book, “Che’s Afterlife: The Legacy of an Image,” I explored the global expansion of the iconic image of the communist revolutionary Ernesto “Che” Guevara, one of the great pre-digital memes of the 20th century, and the cult-like communities that formed around it.  I was less interested in Che Guevara the historical figure than in the romanticized idea of “Che” embraced by devotees around the world in the half-century since his death in 1967. That idea is most often encapsulated in a unique image of the Cuban-Argentine guerilla captured by Havana-based photographer Alberto Korda. It appears on T-shirts, on college dorm-room posters, in tattoos, sometimes in the original black-and-white photographic form but mostly as a two-tone screenprint. Derivative versions place it in different contexts that alter its meaning and turn a left-wing radical into an ironic or sometimes non-ironic commentary on culture and capitalism – Che as Christ, as Colonel Sanders, as a brand of beer, as a motif on a bikini worn by Gisele Bundchen.  What I learned was how images can become shorthand for a statement of membership and belonging. These can be attached to giant rules-based communities, as with the iconography of religions or the flags of nation-states, but it also applies to more transient forms of belonging, such as the logos of popular clothing brands or the symbols of sports teams. Since the dawn of history, groups have been using art to signal both membership of the “tribe” and their differentiation from other tribes.  The value of both the art and membership are intrinsically linked.  The boom in non-fungible token (NFT) communities is an extension of this millennia-old social behavior. Both the issuers and buyers of “Pengus” and “Apes” are collectively striving to build a powerful feedback loop between the appeal of their respective NFT imagery and the formation of an ever-stronger community bond.  Those that succeed will not only boost the value of the underlying NFT collection but also forge a sense of affiliation, as well as a desire among outsiders to cross the “velvet rope” and enter the club. Thanks to the magic of digital assets, success translates directly into financial payoff.  It’s a powerful combination. As anyone who has studied cryptocurrency trends understands, organic promotion by a self-motivated fandom is the best way to generate price appreciation for a token. In NFT communities this FOMO (fear of missing out) game is amplified even more, because membership gives you both the satisfaction of belonging to the club and the capacity to flex your own, individual status through a unique avatar.  See also: A Dictionary for Degens | The Node  In this environment, price becomes a very clear measure of the success of a community. Prices of the NFT collections that are generating the most buzz and membership FOMO are the ones that are soaring. The question is: Does that reflect market demand for the art or is the strength of the community the key force driving the price?  I’m not sure we can answer that question. You can’t disentangle those forces from each other. The value of both the art and membership are intrinsically linked.  NFTS and DAOs: A powerful combo  Now work into this idea the construct of DAOs, where governance in shared investments, software projects or philanthropy is managed by a smart contract rather than by any one administrator.  What emerges is an entirely new idea for what constitutes an enterprise, a new “theory of the firm,” if you will, one that could have a profound impact on innovation and creativity.  As NFT DAOs grow and continue to reinvest the proceeds of their success into new digital asset or art projects, it’s easy to imagine an explosive process of development being unleashed.  Just look at the influence of ApeDAO, a collectively owned investment pool that has been aggressively acquiring NFTs and turning itself into something of a market maker. Last month, it “swept the floor” of the Bored Ape market, picking up dozens of NFTs at low prices, which pushed up the value of the entire collection, in which it has significant holdings, along with other NFT assets. ApeDAO provides a link to its collection, which on Thursday was valued at around $7 million. That kind of strategy is fueling ever more activity in this industry.  This is not to say many NFTs haven’t become overpriced in this current phase or that people buying at these levels won’t lose their shirts. There are plenty of risks that could throw friction into this process, not the least of which is that the tokens of some NFT projects potentially contain the characteristics of securities, exposing them to legal action. (TL;DR: It’s complicated. This is unchartered territory for regulators.)  But the bigger point is that this craze, which to some can seem so frivolous, contains within it some enormously transformative potential.

42394439,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdYZx,1630689413,Bitcoin Won’t Save the Afghan People,"Over the past few years, the residents of countries in financial distress have increasingly turned to cryptocurrency. In Kenya, Nigeria, the Philippines and Venezuela, crypto adoption has been bottom-up. In Cuba and El Salvador, governments are moving to formalize the role of crypto in ways that could make it easier for citizens to use.  But even as a Taliban takeover seems poised to cut Afghans off from the global financial system and desperately needed international aid, the crypto option is unworkable for most residents of the central Asian nation.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  “I want there to be a use case for [using crypto for] humanitarian relief in Afghanistan,” said Alex Zerden, a former U.S. Treasury Department attache to the American embassy in Kabul. “But there are so many structural problems – 90% of the country lives on less than $2 a day. A lot of people don’t have cellphones, much less smartphones. Most people can’t read and they’re innumerate.”  Zerden, who served at the embassy from 2018-2019, is now an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, and runs a consulting firm focused on cryptocurrency.  The gap between Afghanistan and the likes of Venezuela may seem small from a distance, but it’s not. With a gross domestic product of about USD$14,000 per capita as of 2014, Venezuela was formerly a high-income country as classified by the World Bank, with a highly educated populace and fairly robust infrastructure.  Afghanistan’s GDP per capita in 2020 – even after two decades of a U.S. occupation that made gestures toward development – was just over US$500.  Much of even that tiny amount came from foreign aid, which will now be severely constrained. Outside of major cities, necessities like water and food have remained hard to come by, to say nothing of the hardware and know-how needed to use crypto networks.  How, then, did Afghanistan manage to rank 20th in the world for cryptocurrency adoption in an August Chainalysis report?  According to Zerden, that volume was likely driven by the Afghan elites, mostly in Kabul, many of whom have enriched themselves through U.S. spending and rampant U.S.-enabled corruption.  Afghani crypto flows are “likely capital flight for some wealthier Afghans to get money out,” Zerden says. “I don’t think it’s money coming in.” Urban Afghan elites have also used conventional banking to move money to places like the Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and even the U.S. itself.  The impracticality of crypto usage by average Afghans points to a bleak future. The country’s currency is collapsing amid skepticism the Taliban can run an economy, leaving conventional banking in the country on the brink of collapse. Afghanistan’s new Taliban rulers are among those sanctioned by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Controls (OFAC), also including the new head of the Afghan central bank. Nearly $10 billion worth of Afghan central bank reserves held abroad have been seized to keep them out of Taliban hands.  Meanwhile, the foreign aid from U.S. and other governments that has made up 40% of Afghanistan’s GDP is largely drying up, meaning Afghans will be even poorer, and soon. The banking blacklist means non-government organizations (NGO) hoping to fill that gap will face serious challenges getting money into the country and into the hands of Afghans.  The bleak situation is a harsh reminder that crypto and technology can’t fix everything. But neither, it seems, do war and occupation.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,David Z.

42411923,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glh5NT,1630687303,Solana,"Solana is a blockchain-based smart contracts platform designed to facilitate the creation of decentralized applications (dapps). The project was founded by Anatoly Yakovenko in 2017, while its native blockchain and crypto token, SOL, officially went live three years later in March 2020.  The project aims to compete against existing dapp platforms such as Ethereum and touts that its blockchain can process a maximum of 65,000 transactions per second (tps) with average fees of $0.00025. In contrast, Ethereum can handle around 30 tps (prior to the completion of its 2.0 upgrade) with an average transaction fee of $4.50.  In terms of decentralized applications running on its network, Solana has recorded significant growth since its launch, with more than 332 decentralized applications now live. Ethereum, however, still leads in this area with 2,841.  What makes Solana unique?  Consensus mechanism  One thing that sets Solana apart from other dapp-platform competitors is its unique approach to the transaction validation process. Notably, Yakovenko incorporated a system for timestamping transactions such that validators (computers that verify transactions on the blockchain) all have a uniform view of the order in which new activities are being executed on the blockchain.  In other words, this system is essentially a type of consensus mechanism because network participants are tasked with analyzing the validity of transactions and must agree on a single history of events – this is why the whole concept is called the proof-of-history (PoH) consensus.  According to Yakovenko, he borrowed the concept that birthed Solana’s timestamping system from the design of Google’s and Intel’s centralized databases and remodeled the system so that it would fit into a decentralized architecture.  In addition to this mechanism, Solana also implements a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol.  Note that blockchains are not governed by a single entity. Instead, users must play their part to secure and maintain the network. This is especially necessary when validating transactions. Naturally, a blockchain requires users to collectively ensure that all transactions executed on the network are valid. In essence, users have to take up the role of validators.  However, blockchain protocols don’t just pick users indiscriminately whether they are capable or not. Instead, all blockchains expect interested users to prove their readiness to become validators by meeting certain requirements. For example, the Bitcoin blockchain expects users to invest in mining equipment and continuously perform hashing computations.  As for blockchains such as Cardano, Polkadot and Solana, users show their intent to become network validators by staking – or locking away – crypto assets.  The protocol governing this consensus mechanism then randomly picks a staker and grants that person the right to propose and add a new set of confirmed transactions to the blockchain. The protocol that governs the entirety of this process is called the PoS consensus mechanism.  Transaction processing  By combining PoH and PoS consensus protocols, Solana has achieved unprecedented transaction speed without implementing layer 2 products such as side chains. This means the Solana ecosystem relies on just a single chain, unlike other blockchain ecosystems that opt for sharing transaction loads over multiple interoperable blockchains. This is known as “sharding,” and is a feature expected to roll out in Ethereum during its 2.0 upgrade. Polkadot and Zilliqa are other examples of dapp platforms that also leverage sharding to improve their transaction processing capabilities (also known as transaction throughput).  Solana’s single blockchains infrastructure boasts an incredibly fast block time, with a new block created every 400 milliseconds. In comparison, here is a list of block times for other leading decentralized application platforms:  Ethereum: 13 seconds  Cardano: 20 seconds  Binance Smart Chain: 3 seconds  Avalanche: 1.7 seconds  Polygon: 2.2 seconds  Polkadot: 7 seconds  Zilliqa: 45 seconds  What features does Solana have?  Tower Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) algorithm  The Tower BFT protocol reinforces the PoH consensus mechanism such that validators access a single global source of time. With this, the network can leverage a synchronized clock and efficiently eliminate the need to compute and store the timestamps of past transactions on the blockchain. In contrast, other blockchains allow validators to select unconfirmed transactions at random – regardless of the order in which they were executed – and load them sequentially on the blockchain.  Due to this approach, they have to compute the timestamps as part of the requirements for adding new transactions to the blockchain. For Solana, the availability of PoH and Tower consensus eliminates the need for validators to process timestamps, thereby creating more room to focus on other aspects of the transaction validation process.  Gulf Stream  Solana uses a system called Gulf Stream to eliminate the need for a mempool. Think of a mempool as a waiting area for unconfirmed transactions. This is where validators select transactions and subsequently add them to the blockchain. As for Solana, transactions are forwarded to validators even before the status of newly added blocks of transactions is finalized. With this, the Solana blockchain ensures that it does not have a waiting list of unconfirmed transactions.  Sealevel  Solana amplifies the computing capacity of its blockchain by allowing smart contracts to run in parallel. This technology, dubbed “Sealevel,” expands the scalability of Solana so that multiple smart contracts can run concurrently without adversely affecting the speed of the blockchain.  Wormhole  Solana’s wormhole feature introduces a trustless bridging channel between Solana, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Terra’s blockchains. That allows users to seamlessly transfer tokens (fungible and non-fungible) created in these ecosystems between one another, as well as allow non-native dapps to share things like oracle data and liquidity.  Why does Solana emphasize speed?  Like Ethereum, Solana supports smart contracts – these are self-executing computer programs that perform certain functions when predefined conditions are met. Therefore, developers can launch and operate their blockchain applications on Solana.  And as we have witnessed in the Ethereum ecosystem, high-transaction throughput is always one of the core requirements, especially when blockchain applications are involved. This is why the Ethereum ecosystem is undergoing a major upgrade. As such, the Solana development team has always looked for ways to optimize its blockchain’s output.  Solana looks to host a thriving decentralized finance (DeFi) market and actively contribute to the booming NFT sector. One of the first large NFT collections to launch from Solana’s blockchain, called Degenerate Ape Academy, sold out in eight minutes with total trading volumes breaking $69 million.  SOL token  As mentioned earlier, SOL is the native digital asset of the Solana blockchain and is currently ranked among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. At the time of writing, the crypto asset has a total supply of 503,273,124 SOL and a $42 billion market cap.  SOL works like a utility token for settling transaction fees, similar to Ethereum’s gas and is also the base currency for Solana’s staking economy. In essence, you would have to stake SOL to become a validator or earn staking rewards on Solana. However, note that SOL is not the only digital asset accessible in the Solana ecosystem. Like Ethereum, Solana is a multi-asset blockchain where individual blockchain applications operating on the network can independently issue tokens.",NEUTRAL,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ETH | MARKET | SOL,Andrey Sergeenkov,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/solana,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/16526ed683f419091197aba93d0c82811ae7bea8-2122x1413.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

These retail titans are the trendsetters of the current age and their virtual migration is emblematic of the fact that the brands that wish to remain relevant, particularly to younger generations, will need to build in the metaverse, creating user-driven, fully immersive digital experiences that connect with their physical offering.  In today’s metaverse, people are represented by digital avatars that roam in virtual worlds such as Roblox or Decentraland, a decentralized 3D virtual reality platform. However, there is a disconnect between the user’s real self and the digital representation.  From a brand perspective, this gives companies the opportunity to offer their goods within two mediums: the physical world and the virtual world, where avatars can be outfitted in the latest digital sneakers, hoodies and handbags.  Indeed, this new space offers an arena where users can become both virtual and external brand ambassadors. It is shortsighted, however, to see the metaverse as simply a digitized version of the real world where brands will emulate existing shopping conventions and bricks-and-mortar stores. What is so special about the metaverse is that it will allow companies to break from convention and create a world that is totally unbounded by the existing limitations of physical space.  Brands will be able to create experiences that couldn’t occur in the real world, fueled by imagination and creativity. No longer will the physical store be the focal point of sales – there will be opportunities for the real world and virtual worlds to interlink, creating a whole new experiential dimension for businesses and consumers alike.  This could take the form of integrated digital and physical quests that will allow customers to search for branded items in the metaverse, while completing tasks that will also take them to in-world shopping destinations to complete actions or collect their winnings.  The physical and digital world will become indistinguishably integrated.  In a world where physical retail is suffering, the metaverse offers businesses an opportunity to pivot, integrating their physical and digital offerings, to reclaim what it means to sell to customers.  Offering non-fungible tokens (NFTs), digital certificates of ownership that have seen a massive rise in popularity this year, will be essential for businesses looking to make waves and create a brand identity in the metaverse.  Players in the metaverse gain social capital through ownership of items whose value is verified and whose rarity is known. Brands will need to offer players who wish to buy a pair of limited edition digital sneakers, for instance, the certificate of authenticity that proves that they own this digital asset.  Not all brands selling in the metaverse offer NFTs. In the instance of the Gucci handbag that sold for more than $4,000, the buyer only owns the item on Roblox, not via an NFT, which means if Roblox disappears in 50 years, so does the item. In order for the concept of ownership to have meaning and longevity in the metaverse, NFTs will be key.  Currently, you can only experience the internet when you log on, but the metaverse will allow us to experience it all around us, all the time. It will allow the internet to overlay our physical world. What this means for businesses, is that the customer is more important than ever, as they are shaping and driving the business to consumer engagement.  See also: Crypto Is a Luxury, Gucci Just Hasn’t Realized It | Daniel Kuhn  Part of the draw of the metaverse is that users have a hand in its creation. It is a decentralized space where users can create and explore however they want. This is the case in many existing gaming platforms, including Roblox, where users of the platform build games through a developer toolkit.  From a brand perspective, the decentralized nature of metaverse commerce provides an opportunity for brands to sell to players without the help of intermediaries like Amazon who capture significant portions of the profits and technology. It offers a space where smaller sellers will be able to reclaim the attention of their customers, while maintaining control of their profits and exposure.  A future where the virtual economy has as much value as its real-world counterpart is coming. Over the next decade, technology will develop so much that the physical and digital world will become indistinguishably integrated. As brands pivot to align themselves with this new future, it is essential that they redress their focus to create user-driven immersive experiences that place ownership, creativity and inclusivity at the heart of their missions.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MANA | TECHNOLOGY,Holly Atkinson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/03/the-metaverse-is-coming-companies-need-to-prepare,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ff54d96472c959dafab8f9a63c2697de3a44e5a-2400x1363.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Technical charts suggest ETH is poised to continue higher towards the all-time high around $4,300, set on May 12 before a nearly 60% sell-off.

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, appeared to get fresh impetus from a report Friday showing lackluster U.S. jobs growth during August. The report fueled speculation that soft economic data might prompt the Federal Reserve to maintain its program of buying $120 billion a month in bonds longer than previously expected.  Some investors speculate that the U.S. central bank’s accommodative monetary policies will suppress returns on traditional market assets like bonds, strengthening the appeal of bitcoin and other fast-rising cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin climbed to as high as $50,940 on Friday and was changing hands at around $50,700 at press time. That’s the highest price since May, though it is still well off the all-time high of near $65,000 that was reached in April.  Ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, rose 4.9% on Friday, pushing past $4,000 for the first time since May. The price climbed as high as $4,025 before slipping back to $3,960 as of press time.  The resurgence in non-fungible token (NFT) activity and interest in yield-generating decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens have also contributed to ETH’s price rally.

NFTs are a new asset class that enables the creation of unique digital items that can be traded peer-to-peer. This allows for the trading of digital collectibles and ownership across multiple platforms. These characteristics also mean that digital art, music, and video can be sold in a secure fashion without fear of them being copied or stolen. This is an exciting time in history - we are witnessing the birth of a new asset class and people want to own things that represent themselves online. The rise of influencers has made it easier than ever before for people to express themselves through their avatars and influence others with their creativity. People today want to tell stories no one else can tell - stories about where they have been, what they have done, who they know - these are some of the most popular content types online today because people love hearing about other people&apos;s experiences.

Its source can be traced to one sector, decentralized finances. The period was called &apos;DeFi Summer&apos; and Ethereum was thought to be its undisputed king. The series of dApps that comprised the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) ecosystem subverted that idea. Upon its launch, the DeFi sector on Ethereum suffered from a great migration of users that escaped from high transactions fees, and network congestion. In a matter of months, the BSC gave Ethereum a run for its money. To celebrate a year since its deployment, the Dvision Network, a metaverse protocol supported by blockchain technology that was part of that Ethereum to BSC migration, will host a 1st-anniversary celebration. To be performed within the Dvision Metaverse ecosystem, celebrations will start on September 8th until the 13th, and they will be conducted for a period of around 4 to 5 hours each day. &apos;Binance Smart Chain 1st Anniversary in Dvision Metaverse&apos; will take place in the special Binance Hall located in the Dvision World with the participation of over 30 of the most important projects on BSC.

42396906,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT86TI,1630672672,"US Misses Expectations in August Jobs Report, Pushing Bitcoin to 3-Month High","The price of bitcoin rose 1.3% to a 3.5-month high over $50,000 on Friday after the U.S. Labor Department revealed it only added 235,000 jobs in August, far below the consensus estimate of a gain of 725,000 jobs.  The report may encourage the U.S. central bank’s stimulus program, known as “quantitative easing,” or QE, to persist longer than expected. Many cryptocurrency investors speculate that QE could weaken the dollar, pushing up the value of bitcoin, which has a capped supply. Bitcoin is also still seen on Wall Street as a speculative asset, and the bet is that more investors will be forced to seek such investments as QE suppresses returns in traditional bond markets.  Although one month’s data isn’t by itself predictive of the course of the economy, the report may reinforce the idea that macroeconomic uncertainty caused by the Delta variant of COVID-19 will cause the U.S. Federal Reserve to delay winding down its stimulus program of purchasing $120 billion a month in bonds.  Bitcoin and USD Weakness  Jobs reports have historically affected the dollar’s strength in foreign exchange markets, and bitcoin’s price increase after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s gloomy report at the Jackson Hole symposium late last month may point to bitcoin becoming more popular when the dollar recedes.  “What we are starting to see is U.S. interest going down, and USD weakness may be associated with crypto gains,” said economist Jens Nordvig, founder of research firm Exante Data.  Although historically crypto hasn’t been correlated with moves in USD, Nordvig added, and there have been times when bad U.S. economic news has tanked bitcoin, like in March 2020 when the digital asset swooned with traditional markets.  “We believe the crypto market could be vulnerable on a short-term basis to any risk-off reactions to the U.S. jobs report,” said Joel Kruger, market strategist at institutional crypto exchange LMAX Digital.  Attaching price movements of any asset to mainstream economic indicators has been much more difficult during the pandemic, Nordvig said.  “I think these correlations are just starting to kick in, but they are not strong yet,” Nordvig said. “I think they will get stronger and stronger, as institutions enter the market.”  Delta Variant Impact  Despite the lower-than-expected increase in U.S. jobs in August, the unemployment rate fell to 5.2% from 5.4% in July, according to the report. The U.S. is down 5.3 million jobs from its pre-pandemic levels in February 2020, and unemployment among Black Americans jumped from 8.2% to 8.8%. Meanwhile, labor force participation among Black Americans increased.  The government also revised the July jobs growth figure to 962,000, up by 24,000 jobs from the initially reported 943,000 jobs.  Major job losses occurred in the retail and restaurant industries, losing 29,000 and 42,000 jobs respectively. Zero jobs were added in leisure and hospitality. Professional and business services rose by 74,000, transportation and warehousing rose by 53,000, manufacturing rose by 37,000, entertainment rose by 36,000, and information technology rose by 17,000.  The labor force participation rate – the percentage of the American population that is either working or actively looking for work – was unchanged from the 61.7% recorded in July.  The employment-to-population ratio, which measures the number of people employed against the total working-age population, changed little month to month at 58.5% from 58.4% in July.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/03/august-jobs-report-us-added-235000-missing-expectations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d3309e0341ef946382d3dd21b274f04a808397fe-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Binance noted that it has registered with the FIC as a voluntary self-disclosure institution, and has collaborated with the organization on over 462 cases so far in 2021. The company added that “we have reached out to the FSCA for more clarification on their statement and look forward to working with them and addressing any concerns they may have.”  Binance has faced a string of warnings from regulators and other bodies around the world, which have spurred its attempts to become more proactive in its dealing with regulators.

On Aug. 2, Hold Hodl reported a security issue on its platform for peer-to-peer bitcoin loans, named Lend. The team asked users to migrate their loan contracts to new escrows and get stronger payment passwords. Hodl Hodl also said it had to force-liquidate some of the contracts to keep users’ funds safe from possible attacks.  In an update on Friday, Hodl Hodl said two vulnerabilities were found in Lend’s code. The team did not identify any loss of users’ funds. However, it “had no guarantee that these vulnerabilities weren’t exploited already, and some user payment passwords weren’t obtained by bad actors,” according to a Sept. 2 blog post explaining why the team asked users to migrate their funds to new escrows.  Hodl Hodl also force-liquidated some of the most risky contracts, less than 1% of all contracts, the blog post said.  Hodl Hodl does not store users’ funds and runs on what the team calls bitcoin smart contracts, allowing users to generate multisignature escrow wallets in which the bitcoin gets locked until the deal is complete. This allows people to trade bitcoin for fiat money or borrow USD-denominated stablecoins, like USDT, for collateral without parking their funds with a third-party entity, as centralized platforms do.  In late July, Hodl Hodl hired a new auditing firm to check the security of its code, and the firm found two vulnerabilities. “One of them allowed to easily brute force weak passwords. Another one was found in the front end of our lending platform. This vulnerability could lead users to input their payment passwords into a fake form (produced and generated by the attacker), allowing them to access the user’s private key,” Hodl Hodl wrote.  The issue applied only to the lending product, not the trading product, CEO Max Keidun told CoinDesk. He confirmed no funds had been stolen.  The team is now working on “new extra security features, which will be a part of a more significant update called Lend 2.0,” according to the blog. The new platform will be launched sometime in September, the company added, and will “contain major security and UI/UX improvements and use a different security and usability approach than the previous version.”  For now, the platform is closed to new loan contracts, which will become available after the relaunch. Existing contracts that haven’t expired yet are still running on the platform, Keidun said.",NEGATIVE,USDT,BTC | FIAT | TRADING | USDT,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/03/hodl-hodl-explains-august-security-issues-puts-lending-on-hold,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b4dc00d758a25c03942ef4d3e201ec8ca06c4066-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396919,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT86f6,1630661665,Solana’s SOL Replaces Dogecoin as 7th Largest Cryptocurrency,"Programmable blockchain Solana’s SOL token rallied to a new high on Friday, replacing the meme-focused cryptocurrency dogecoin as the seventh-largest coin by market value.  SOL climbed 12% to $145, establishing a foothold above Tuesday’s record of $130, data from Messari shows. The cryptocurrency’s market capitalization jumped to $42 billion, surpassing dogecoin’s $38 billion.  Since Solana launched the non-fungible tokens (NFT) project Degenerate Ape Academy on Aug. 15, the SOL token has tripled in price. The timing couldn’t have been better, given the ongoing NFT sugar rush.  “Solana’s popularity, already boosted by Sam Bankman-Fried’s support, has seen unprecedented price action on the back of strong mindshare growth, a flurry of decentralized application launches and, most recently, the frenzy around their Kaiju cards NFT launch,” Jehan Chu, co-founder, and managing partner at Keneti Capital, a blockchain investment and trading firm, told CoinDesk, referring to the man behind trading firm Alameda Capital.  Kaiju Cards is a collectibles card game built on Solana’s blockchain and modeled along classic styles like Yugioh, Pokemon and MTG.  “Kaiju Cards NFTs are serialized, not generative. Think Pokemon or MTG, but with serial numbers on the blockchain,” the official blog says. “Each character is created and hand drawn by one of our four industry-artists who have done original work for Adult Swim, Apple, Nickelodeon, Netflix and other places you may recognize. There are 23 original characters contained in the Alpha Series.”  The presale of the Alpha Series aimed at giving early supporters and community members access to cards at a lower price took place on Aug. 20. The final distribution occurred Wednesday and was met with high demand. That may have boosted SOL’s price: The cards were priced at 5 SOL and 8 SOL.  “I believe there were way above 10,000 people online on their Discord,” one trader told CoinDesk in a Discord chat. “But only 3,500 NFT to mint – and only 1 card per wallet was allowed. So yes, demand was more than reasonable.”  Another trader said the latest leg higher in SOL could be related to Friday’s launch of Solsea, the first open NFT marketplace on Solana.  Solana’s ecosystem is booming, and the blockchain has garnered the support of major investors thanks to its perceived scalability, relatively low transaction costs and fast processing speed.  Still, SOL now looks overbought with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) hovering well above 70, indicating the pace of the rally may slow. “With volatility this high, SOL calls might be a decent sell,” QCP Capital said in its latest market analysis. Investors typically sell calls when the asset is expected to consolidate or move lower. Traders sell options when volatility is expected to drop. That’s because volatility has a positive impact on options’ prices.",POSITIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | DOGE | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/03/solanas-sol-replaces-dogecoin-as-7th-largest-cryptocurrency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a930c00e480b6373c00c99d96777fcd9facfe168-1900x1267.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411914,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glh4x1,1630661291,GameFi: How to Earn Crypto Playing Games Online,"GameFi is one of the hottest new trends to emerge from the crypto industry, combining decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with blockchain-based online games.  Unlike many traditional online games, which operate on a “pay-to-win” model and allow players to purchase upgrades in order to gain an advantage over others, GameFi introduces a “play-to-earn” model. This concept involves giving players financial incentives to play and progress through games. In some cases, this has allowed gamers to earn a full-time income by doing so.  How it works  All objects in these types of games are expressed as NFTs – digital tokens used to prove ownership of scarce intangible items. Think of things like plots of land, avatars, costumes, weapons and gold bars. Once players find and accrue these items through gameplay, many have the option to trade these with others in digital marketplaces for different NFTs, or sell them in exchange for cryptocurrency.  Depending on which game is played, users can increase their earning potential by dedicating time leveling-up and improving their characters, creating monetized structures on their land that other gamers pay to use or by competing against others in tournaments.  In order to keep track of what every player owns, all NFTs and cryptocurrency transaction data are stored on a public blockchain. This is a type of distributed, digital record-keeping technology maintained by a global network of computers. Leveraging this technology in gaming provides a number of benefits, including:  Players can easily prove ownership of their in-game items.  There is no single point of failure, meaning players will no longer be at risk of losing track of what they own if the underlying gaming company experiences technical issues.  Items accrued during gameplay cannot be counterfeited, removed or destroyed.  Game-native cryptocurrencies can be sent and received without the need for intermediary settlement, clearing or custody.  Some games also include DeFi elements such as staking, where players can lock away certain tokens in order to earn annual interest and other rewards they can save to purchase other in-game items or unlock new content.  What you need to play  In order to take part in any these play-to-earn games, users will need to do the following:  Create a cryptocurrency wallet: To store their virtual currency and NFTs, and make in-game transactions. Which wallet you need will depend on which blockchain the game was built upon. For example, MetaMask – an Ethereum-based crypto wallet service – will work with any GameFi game built on Ethereum.  Purchase starter items: All GameFi games are free to download. However, many require players to first purchase characters, native crypto tokens, decks of cards or upgrades in order to begin.  Pre-funded crypto wallet: You will need to pre-fund your crypto wallet with a particular cryptocurrency in order to purchase starter items and proceed. Cryptoblades, for example, requires users to download MetaMask, purchase Binance coin (BNB) and exchange it for the game’s native cryptocurrency, SKILL.  Top GameFi games right now  For players looking to get involved in these blockchain-based games and start earning cryptocurrency and NFTs, here is a breakdown of some of the leading games currently available.  Alien Worlds  In this game, players join an alien universe consisting of several planets where they must fight for scarce resources and mine the game’s native cryptocurrency, trillium (TLM). Players can also battle each other, go on quests and earn additional income by renting out their land to others.  Alien Worlds was the first game to break through 100,000 users and currently boasts over 2.5 million players. This was, in part, due to its free-to-play nature and the fact its metaverse world spans across multiple blockchains including WAX, Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain.  Native crypto token: trilium (TLM)  Blockchains: Native WAX blockchain, but also runs off Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC)  Monthly user base: 1,000,000  Initial investment required: You are required to buy NFT game cards such as land in order to mine.  CryptoBlades  CryptoBlades is a web-based role playing game that emulates traditional games like Skyrim or Dark Souls. Players can battle monsters or complete in-game raids to earn SKILL tokens. To help with battles, players can craft weapons to build an advantage over their opponents or boost their power. These items can then be traded in an open marketplace.  The gameplay itself is straightforward. There are four main components – fire, earth, lightning and water – allocated to each character, weapon, attribute and enemy. Each component will have its strengths and weaknesses, which players must then utilize and build strategies to beat their opponents.  Native crypto token: cryptoblades (SKILL)  Blockchain: Binance Smart Chain  Monthly user base: 510,000  Initial investment required: Users will need to purchase around 0.2 BNB to play and pay for transaction fees in-game.  Axie Infinity  A Pokemon-inspired universe where you can buy, take care of, breed and trade digital monsters called “Axies.” Axie Infinity runs off its own specifically built sidechain so that it can optimize gameplay and scale effectively.  The game has a high earning potential but requires high involvement to breed, care for and trade rare or unique Axies. These monsters can battle each other to earn SLP tokens or be sent on quests for resource farming.  Native token: axie infinity (AXS) and smooth love potion (SLP)  Blockchain: Ethereum  Monthly user base: 308,000  Initial investment required: You need to purchase three Axies from the in-house marketplace before you can play.  Upland  Upland is an NFT metaverse made to parallel our world where players can buy, sell and trade properties linked to real-world addresses. Users can then play, run businesses and connect with other Uplanders across the world.  Players have an Upland avatar that can roam throughout a city to look for available properties for purchase. Or they can visit other players’ properties. To earn special UPX rewards and increase a property’s earnings, users can complete a Collection. This is similar to Monopoly; the more properties you have of a single color, the more valuable they are.  Native token: upland (UPX)  Blockchain: EOS  Monthly user base: 155,000  Initial investment required: To open an account, you need to first purchase a virtual property.  Splinterlands  This is a digital collectible card game where players build up a collection of cards with various abilities and stats and use them to battle other players. Each card is represented by an NFT and are tradable or can be exchanged on the open market. The game relies on one-on-one fighting where players are randomly assigned battle parameters.  Both players then have a limited amount of time to build a deck of cards they will use to fight each other.  Native token: dark energy crystals (DEC) and splintershards (SPS), which is the governance token  Blockchain: Hive blockchain  Monthly user base: 120,000  Initial investment required: You must buy the summoner’s spellbook for $10 if you want to unlock the play-to-earn features and receive DEC tokens.  Where did GameFi come from?  The emergence of GameFi comes from a combination of factors that dates back to 2017 and the emergence of the NFT phenomenon CryptoKitties. The digital collectibles economy proved a viral success, with CryptoKitties amassing over 14,914 users a day at its peak. CryptoPunks, a collection of 10,000 pixelated NFT characters also built on Ethereum, enjoyed similar success, surpassing $1 billion in sales over 2018.  Unfortunately, the success of these NFTs showed both the good and bad sides of the state of blockchain technology at the time. Games like CryptoKitties caused heavy congestion on the Ethereum network, leading to extreme spikes in transaction fees and much slower than normal transaction confirmation times. These technical issues highlighted a clear gap in the market for more efficient and scalable platforms that could handle the rising demand from online gamers and virtual asset collectors.  Since then, a number of new “Ethereum killer” blockchains have emerged that promise faster transaction speeds, greater scalability and cheaper fees. These include the likes of Solana and Cardano, both of which have recently set new all-time highs as investors bet big on new dapp competitors.  The proliferation of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms over 2020 was the next critical component enabling GameFi’s growth, introducing a range of blockchain-native financial platforms that run entirely using smart contracts. This provided the infrastructure for decentralized exchanges where in-game cryptocurrencies could be launched from and traded, as well as additional features like lending and staking.  In September 2020, Yearn.finance founder and DeFi developer Andre Conje tweeted about the gamification of monetary policies in a decentralized environment. He recognized the multiple benefits DeFi and NFTs could bring to the online gaming industry, and GameFi applications quickly started to form. Axie Infinity was one of the first play-to-earn games to take off in a big way, surpassing $1 billion in revenue on Aug. 9, 2021.  What’s next?  GameFi has already gained significant traction, with the collective market capitalization of top games breaking $14 billion. But key opinion leaders in the crypto industry believe there’s a lot more ahead for this new sector, with Tron founder Justin Sun recently stating he believes this new sector will be key to increasing cryptocurrency adoption.  ”GameFi is going to be the next big thing that makes the DeFi, NFT and the larger crypto space easy to understand and be involved in.”  Crypto startups and gaming companies are already racing to capitalize on this explosive trend, with a long list of new games preparing to launch over the next several months, including:  Star Atlas  Ember Sword  Guild of Guardians  LegendsofCrypto  The Sandbox  Dr Who: World’s Apart  There are also entire gaming platforms being built, such as MOBOX, which allows people to create their own interoperable games and NFTs. It also integrates DeFi elements like liquidity pools and staking where gamers can generate an income from their assets which can be used to purchase upgrades or generate keys to unlock chests containing new NFTs.  The GameFi universe does not seem to be slowing down any time soon. With new investment and GameFi-specific funds pouring in, the potential of the sector is endless.",POSITIVE,AXS | BNB,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | BNB,"Annika Feign, Ollie Leech",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/gamefi-how-to-earn-crypto-playing-games-online,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b6555742beca09f4bb4323244de5f5e941eeb80-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421040,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXBL9Z,1630649537,What Apple Settling App Store Lawsuit Means for Crypto NFTs,"When news broke last week that Apple would be settling a class-action lawsuit brought by developers in 2019, Crypto Twitter fell silent.  But those who understood the momentous event realized the potential ramifications of the U.S. tech giant loosening its grip for various sectors across the blockchain industry, particularly as it relates to non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  NFTs are unique assets that grant gamers and collectors full ownership over their digital items. Readers may recall the time when artist Beeple sold a piece of digital artwork for a mind-blowing $69.3 million at auction earlier this year. The sector has since caught fire, with everyone from celebrities to charities and news organizations attempting to tap into the craze.  And while cryptocurrencies are still being worked out as a means of efficient and acceptable forms of payment in the mainstream, NFTs continue to forge new ground.  “Regardless of whether cryptocurrencies become a common form of payment in the “real world,” they’re increasingly being used in gaming via NFTs and blockchain-based studios,” venture capitalist Mathew Ball wrote in a blog post in June.  Ball argues the main reason most crypto games and NFT platforms are solely browser-based and not packaged in iOS apps is because of Apple’s restrictions on small developers.  Read more: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?  On August 26, Apple agreed to loosen App Store restrictions on small developers in a legal settlement that could see Apple fork over $100 million and allow developers to direct consumers to payment rails outside of the store. As MarketWatch reported, this would allow developers to avoid fees of up to 30% that Apple charges for online purchases in iOS apps.  The Cameron et al v. Apple Inc. settlement is pending approval by Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.  If all goes well, Apple will also allow developers worldwide to directly discuss with customers about alternative payment methods using data gathered, pending customer permission, from inside their apps.  The extension provided to NFTs would present a momentous win to developers and creators behind the crypto-based projects who would suddenly gain access to a vast trove of tech-savvy users, according to some.  “This is a landmark case for the NFT industry,” said Simon Kertonegoro, CEO of MyMetaverse and marketing adviser at NFT powerhouse Enjin. “In the near future, NFTs will be sold on websites, games, apps and decentralized marketplaces all over the internet. Users will then want to be able to plug those NFTs into iOS apps and enjoy their in-app utility.”  Kertonegoro joins a growing list of NFT advocates who believe the Apple settlement is a “big step” toward the tech giant becoming an ecosystem that can “fully support NFTs.”  Legal woes  Developer fees, as well as Apple’s rules requiring the use of the tech giant’s payment options from inside apps with no alternative payment methods, also form a large part of a separate legal battle brought by Fortnite videogame developer Epic Games.  Epic Games Inc. v. Apple is considered a landmark antitrust case currently being presided over by the same judge overseeing the Cameron et al v. Apple Inc. settlement.  Last weeks’ proposal strikes at the very heart of concerns for small developers making less than $1 million per year. It also is the first major concession Apple has made amid a number of antitrust investigations. Apple defended the practices of its App Store, which keeps tight rules against developers using contact information accrued from customers who sign up via the App Store.  In a statement last week, Apple said it “appreciates the developer feedback” that helped inform the settlement agreement, and that the tech giant “respects the ongoing judicial review process” while praising its App Store as “an economic miracle.”  Pending approval, the agreement stipulates that developers can share payment options with customers outside of Apple’s iOS app, expand on subscription price points as well as in-app purchases, and Apple will set up a new fund to assist U.S. developers.
