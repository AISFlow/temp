7568,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=495919,1657998050,Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Exchange Netflows Spike Up,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin exchange netflow has observed a sharp positive spike recently, a sign that could be bearish for the crypto’s price. Bitcoin All Exchanges Netflow Spikes Up Following 9% Inflation Report As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, exchanges have recently seen a large amount of BTC deposits. The “all exchanges netflow” is an indicator that measures the net amount of Bitcoin entering or exiting wallets of all centralized exchanges as a whole. The metric’s value is calculated by simply taking the difference between the inflows and the outflows. When the value of the netflow is positive, it means a net number of coins are moving into these wallets right now. As investors usually deposit their coins to exchanges for selling purposes, this kind of trend can prove to be bearish for the value of BTC. Related Reading | Bitcoin Funding Rate Turns Highly Positive, Long Squeeze In The Making? On the other hand, the value of the indicator being negative suggests investors are withdrawing their coins at the moment. Such a trend, when prolonged, can be a sign of accumulation from holders, and hence can be bullish for the price of the crypto. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin all exchanges netflow over the past week: Looks like the value of the metric has spiked up recently | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the Bitcoin exchange netflow has observed a positive spike over the past 24 hours. There was another spike not too long before this latest one, but that other spike was neutralized by a similarly large negative value of the metric. Related Reading | Market Update: MATIC, UNI And AAVE Outperforms While Bitcoin Strugles To Hold Above $20k The quant in the post notes that inflows on the crypto exchange Gemini (which is popularly known to be used by whales) have contributed to this positive netflow value. These deposits have come a couple of days after the CPI report for the month came out and revealed that inflation rose 9% in June. If the inflows are indeed from whales looking to dump their coins, then the near term outlook can be bearish for the price of Bitcoin. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price floats around $20.8k, down 4% in the last seven days. Over the past month, the crypto has lost 7% in value.

7284,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3857285-crypto-winter-forces-riot-blockchain-core-scientific-bitfarms-to-sell-some-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1657984140,"Crypto winter forces Riot Blockchain, Core Scientific, Bitfarms to sell some bitcoin.","In the wake of arguably the worst crypto market downturn in the industry's short history, miners Riot Blockchain ( NASDAQ: RIOT ), Core Scientific ( NASDAQ: CORZ ) and Bitfarms ( NASDAQ: BITF ) have been forced to sell a portion of their bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) stakes in a bid to free up capital. That comes as crypto miners’ performance metrics in aggregate have weakened somewhat again in June, as the number of bitcoins ( BTC-USD ) mined edged down 1.8% on average, though mining capacity as measured by the hash rate jumped 8.8%, according to the table below. As miners face tanking crypto prices, rising energy prices as well as heightened competition, Riot Blockchain ( RIOT ), for example, not only saw its bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining and hash rate growth decline M/M in June, but it also sold 300 bitcoins for net proceeds of approximately $6.2M to help cover operational costs, namely the development of its Whinstone facility in Rockdale, Texas. Still, the company holds over 22x that amount of BTC. Nevertheless, “it’s still important to us to have a strong bitcoin balance sheet, so we haven’t sold from the balance sheet per se,” Riot CEO Jason Les told Blockworks on July 14, adding that “There’s not a strict framework or policy around that. It’s a decision we are evaluating on a monthly basis.” SA contributor Dilantha De Silva , who started coverage on Riot ( RIOT ) with a Strong Sell rating towards the end of June, believes the company cannot “make sustainable profits and reiterate that it is a highly volatile business that is strongly reliant on fluctuating Bitcoin prices.” For Core Scientific ( CORZ ), which produces the most amount of BTC among its peers, it got rid of a whopping 7,202 bitcoins ( BTC-USD ) last month at an average price of approximately $23K per token for total proceeds of ~$167M. Those profits were used to pay for ASIC servers, capital investments in additional data center capacity as well as scheduled repayment of debt. Take a look at why SA contributor Made Easy - Finance views the stock as a Hold. Similarly, Bitfarms ( BITF ) in June sold 3,352 bitcoins ( BTC-USD ) for total proceeds of $69M in an effort to reduce overall debt and increase liquidity amid turbulent market conditions. Over the course of June, the price of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has nosedived over 33% as the financial contagion effect in the crypto market triggered by the collapse of crypto exchange Celsius and crypto-focused hedge fund Three Arrows Capital keeps spreading. It comes at no surprise that crypto miners, most of whom cited poor market conditions in recent months, experienced similar drawdowns at the time, as per this chart . The $1T question on most people’s minds is where does the price of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) go from here? One way to look at the matter is the token’s cost of production which has dropped to around $13K from about $24K at the beginning of June, J.P. Morgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note to clients on July 13. The slump in bitcoin production costs come as BTC miners try to protect their profitability by deploying additional mining rigs and hence mining efficiency is on the rise in a move that could be a negative for BTC prices going forward, he added. The falling production cost has been driven primarily from “the decline in electricity use as proxied by the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, while the hash rate has been fluctuating in recent months with no clear downtrend,” Panigirtzoglou explained. “While clearly helping miners’ profitability and potentially reducing pressures on miners to sell Bitcoin holdings to raise liquidity or for deleveraging, the decline in the production cost might be perceived as negative for the Bitcoin price outlook going forward,” Panigirtzoglou noted. “The production cost is perceived by some market participants as the lower bound of the Bitcoin’s price range in a bear market.” Previously, (June 11) Marathon Digital, Riot Blockchain bitcoin mining growth softened the most in May . 2022 Company Ticker Type June May April Three-Month Average Marathon Digital ( MARA ) bitcoins mined 140.1 268 299 235.7 Bitfarms ( BITF ) bitcoins mined 420 431 405 418.7 hash rate (EH/s) 3.6 3.4 3.3 3.4 HIVE Blockchain ( HIVE ) bitcoins mined 278.5 273.4 268.8 273.6 hash rate (EH/s) 2.17 2.18 2.15 2.2 Riot Blockchain ( RIOT ) bitcoins mined 421 466 508 465.0 hash rate (EH/s) 4.4 4.6 4.7 4.6 CleanSpark ( CLSK ) bitcoins mined 339 312 313 321.3 hash rate (EH/s) 2.8 2.5 2.4 2.6 Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ) bitcoins mined 328 309 309 315.3 hash rate (EH/s) 2.78 2.64 2.58 2.7 Core Scientific ( CORZ ) bitcoins mined 1106 1138 1121 1121.7 hash rate (EH/s) 10.3 9.2 8.9 9.5 Argo Blockchain ( ARBK ) bitcoins mined 179 124 166 156.3 BitNile ( NILE ) bitcoins mined 46.4 39 38.5 41.3 Greenidge Generation ( GREE ) bitcoins mined 230 195 197 207.3 hash rate (EH/s) 2.5 1.7 1.6 1.9 Average bitcoins mined 348.8 355.5 362.5 Average hash rate 4.08 3.75 3.66",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3857285-crypto-winter-forces-riot-blockchain-core-scientific-bitfarms-to-sell-some-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7284.jpeg

After registering for bankruptcy protection in the face of various probes, the token’s value transcended pressure and increased by more than 25 percent on Saturday. Despite the present efforts of its management, the Celsius Network token is exhibiting indications of a revival, according to certain observers. In the past 24 hours, the price of a CEL has increased by approximately 80 percent. CEL Up 30% – Bullish Run In The Offing? CEL was trading at $0.73 at the time of writing, a 30 percent rise over its July 15 closing price. Faced with skepticism and a growing number of withdrawal stoppage, CEL’s price soared from $0.64 to $1.53 on June 19 and June 20. Celsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy late Wednesday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. Last month, the company halted withdrawals, swaps, and transfers on its platform, claiming “extreme market volatility.” Suggested Reading | ApeCoin Performance Lags Behind Other Altcoins – Here’s What Happened To APE The worldwide cryptocurrency market capitalization was trading at $928 billion, up more than 3% in the previous 24 hours. The total trading volume of cryptocurrencies increased almost 3% to $77 billion. The suspension of withdrawals by Celsius Network last month pushed the cryptocurrency market into a gloomy pit, as its bankruptcy petition revealed $1.2 billion in faulty agreements. This includes the liquidation of $840 million in Tether debt, $750 million worth of mining hardware, and the loss of 38,000 ETH because of staking. In addition, it has $411 million in outstanding loans to retail customers, secured by digital assets valued at $765 million. BTC total market cap at $397 billion on the weekend chart | Source: TradingView.com CEL Seeing Steady Ascent The price rally of CEL appears to be quite typical, with the token witnessing steady climbs and dips over the previous 30 days. On June 21, CEL peaked at $1.53 per token before rapidly reversing course. Meanwhile, since Celsius began repaying its financial obligations last week, on-chain analysis of CEL has showed steady accumulation, according to data from Santiment. Outside of established exchanges, the quantity of CEL tokens has increased by 0.5 percent during the past three days. Suggested Reading | Avalanche Notches Solid Mid-Week Bounce – Can AVAX Sustain The Positive Noise? Likewise, the volume of Celsius has been increasing recently. The CEL volume was 18 million in the early morning hours of July 15. At press time, the same volume stood at 66 million. The variation in volume is indicative of fluctuating investor sentiment. The price of Celsius’ CEL cryptocurrency is increasing as a result of short sellers unloading CEL tokens on exchanges. Coinglass has reported that exchanges including Okex, FTX, and Huobi are experiencing short positions of more than 80 percent.

The firm believes this could further propel towards major price movements this weekend. “XRPNetwork saw a major anomaly to end the week, with a rapid surge up to 18.7B in $XRP trading volume in the final hour of Friday (UTC time). This may be worth monitoring for some unordinary upcoming weekend price action,” Santiment tweeted. 😮 #XRPNetwork saw a major anomaly to end the week, with a rapid surge up to 18.7B in $XRP trading volume in the final hour of Friday (UTC time). This may be worth monitoring for some unordinary upcoming weekend price action. 📊https://t.co/5ohmnn81WE pic.twitter.com/G6g78itdMn — Santiment (@santimentfeed) July 16, 2022 The reason for the sudden uptick could be attributed to the recent big wins in their case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On Tuesday, the Magistrate Judge in charge, Sarah Netburn, ruled in favor of Ripple, denying the SEC’s claim of attorney-client privilege for documents regarding the controversial William Hinman speech. This has strengthened the belief in a positive outcome for Ripple in the 2-year-long legal battle. Increased Adoption Of The XRP Network Additionally, the network has also recently seen increased adoption of its network including the growth of NFT development on the network. For instance, CryptoBar P2P, a Tokyo-based social platform, has added XRP as a payment method. NFTMaster has also announced that it has launched an NFT marketplace on the XRP ledger. Big brands are also taking up to launch their very first NFT collection on the XRP network. For instance, just a month ago, automobile manufacturer Lotus Cars announced plans to launch their very own NFT collection.

In a recent interview, Garlinghouse claimed that by the time the legal dispute was over, Ripple would have shelled out more than $100 million in legal fees. “The facts and Law are on the side… When this is all done, we will have spent over $100 million on legal fees fighting the SEC… This fight is not just for Ripple, it’s for the whole Industry,” Garlinghouse said at Consensus 2022 in Austin, Texas, on July 15. SEC Coerced Companies Into Settlements Ripple CEO asserts that the SEC has always benefited from the prohibitive costs of a judicial battle because of the securities regulator. Garlinghouse claims that the SEC relies on the fact that most crypto-related businesses do not have the financial means to sue the agency. He said that as a result, they repeatedly bullied these businesses into signing a settlement. Ripple Case Insights The CEO of Ripple gave some explanations as to why the company chose to litigate the matter rather than settle, as most bitcoin businesses would have done in similar circumstances. Garlinghouse thinks the ongoing legal battle is vital for the whole cryptocurrency industry, not just Ripple.

7566,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=495911,1657975520,"Blue Chip NFTs 101 – Down, Down, To Goblintown. An Unlikely Success Story","Goblintown ‘s rise to the top is one for the books. The Moonbirds came into prominence in a bearish market, but the Goblins took over in the middle of a global recession and the NFTs first winter. How did these misfits do it? Using confusion, misdirection, FOMO, and a great marketing plan that took everyone by surprise. People weren’t sure of what was happening, but they didn’t want to stay out of the party. The creators of Goblintown made it easy for them. First of all, the project was a free mint. Second, it uses a Creative Commons Zero license, which means no Copyright and the possibility of commercializing the Goblin drawings as needed. Third, even though the hype was there, they didn’t use influencers, cross promotions, or whitelisting. Maybe because of that, the mint didn’t generate a gas war like many other successful projects. Goblintown ‘s Unusual Launch Launched on May 22, 2022, the generative collection runs over the Ethereum blockchain. From the beginning, Goblintown promised, “No roadmap. No Discord. No utility. CC0. Contract wasn’t actually written by goblins.” The other sentence that stands out from Goblintown’s website is: “Don’t be f*cking greedy. That’s how we got ourselves here.” This suggests that the collection serves as a commentary on the NFT market and culture. And that’s not the only clue pointing that way. On the slightly negative side, the royalties are a whopping 10% and the creators set aside 1000 NFTs for their other projects’ holders. Considering Goblintown was a free mint, those two factors don’t seem that bad. So far, the main collection has generated 43.9K ETH in total sale volume and has a 3.1 ETH floor price at Opensea. For a moment there, Goblintown was so hot that it flipped the almighty Bored Ape Yacht Club and became the highest-selling collection for a day or two. The Mystery Of Goblintown’s Creators At first, they thought it was notorious NFT artist Beeple. Then, that the infamous Yuga Labs was behind the project. For a time there, people even believed that the brain and voice behind “Beavis And Butthead” and “King of the Hill,” Mike Judge was Goblintown’s creator. And, since one of the Goblins kind of looks like Snoop Dogg, that rumor circulated too. It made sense because people still believe that Snoop is famed NFT collector Cozomo de’ Medici, even though that story proved to be false. The only one that came forward and addressed the rumors was Beeple, who tweeted, “insane I have to say this, but I have not joined any shockingly low effort pump and dump projects that will remain nameless.” Later, as the Goblintown project proved its worth, the creator changed his tune and tweeted the piece “The rise and fall of Goblintown” together with the hashtag “#iamthefounder.” THE RISE AND FALL OF GOBLINTOWN #iamthefounder pic.twitter.com/oHWlm3IduY — beeple (@beeple) June 5, 2022 However, Beeple was not the founder. Seeing Goblintown’s immense success, the mysterious creators had to doxx themselves. Just in time for the NFT NYC conference, they released a message in which they admitted that Truth Labs was behind the project. The company was behind the mildly successful NFT collections Illuminati Collective and The 187, and struck gold with their third outing. On Truth’s website they define themselves as: “We are dedicated to sharing delightful blockchain mischief, exploring creatively, developing rich, fun worlds and experiences (both IRL and in the digital realm), and providing a platform for new voices and visions in this space.” In a strange turn of events, as the creators doxxed themselves, Goblintown’s floor price fell from almost 5 ETH to a little over 3 ETH. ETH price chart for 07/16/2022 on Binance | Source: ETH/USD on TradingView.com The Collection’s Iconography The Goblintown name comes from The Hobbit, specifically from a J.R.R. Tolkien poem called “Down, Down, To Goblin Town.” That name also suggests that the collection serves as a commentary on the NFT market in the crypto winter. Are there other clues? Several. For example, one goblin like Dj and producer Steve Aoki, who’s a notorious NFT collector. Another one wears a t-shirt that says “Phunks, Zunks, Tendies, Azuki,” a clear reference to Azuki’s creator and all of his rugged previous projects. Yet another one of the traits is a reference to the infamous Mike Novogratz’s Luna tattoo, and thus a commentary on Terra’s collapse. Then we have a goblin with a tattoo saying $LUNA. This is likely a reference to @terra_money and the $83B collapse of the stablecoin $UST. https://t.co/wn0lliBVY3 pic.twitter.com/D5vj54rqbk — tansan.eth — ₜₕₑ bₑₐₙ Gₒbₗᵢₙ (@tansanDOTeth) May 30, 2022 And, what about this image that references a lot of blue chip NFT projects and is titled “Up, Up, To Goblintown.” ᵤₚ ᵤₚ ₜₒ gₒbₗᵢₙ ₜₒwₙ pic.twitter.com/zjngNZc1en — goblintown.wtf (@goblintownwtf) May 22, 2022 And well, speaking about Steve Aoki, he was the Dj at Goblintown’s highly coveted NFT NYC party. There, he premiered the horrible NFT song “Piss On the Dance Floor (Goblintown Anthem).“ You can still buy it at a reasonable price here. And, speaking about NFT NYC, for better or worse, Goblintown managed to be the center of attention throughout the whole conference. What a story.

Morgan Allowed to Find New Job Before Trial According to a Bloomberg report from today, Heather Morgan requested a judge in Washington to modify the conditions of her pre-trial release terms to allow her to seek ‘legitimate employment and receive income greater than $10,000 per month.’ The report by Bloomberg further pointed out that prosecutors did not object to the request. In February, the U.S. Department of Justice arrested Morgan and her husband in New York for attempting to launder over $3.6 billion in Bitcoin linked to the 2016 hack on the Bitfinex exchange. The agency also seized $3.6 billion worth of bitcoin tied to the 2016 hack of Bitfinex. According to court documents, they allegedly conspired to launder the proceeds of roughly 119,754 Bitcoin stolen in 2016 from Bitfinex and initiated over 2,000 unauthorized transactions to a wallet belonging to Lichtenstein. Both Morgan and Lichtenstein were charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to defraud the United States and could face as many as 25 years in prison if convicted. They were subsequently granted bail.

While industry eyes were focused on the carnage dominating its lending and venture capital sector, Polkadot developers quietly shipped hundreds of forkless upgrades across its Substrate-based chains, while the Web3 Foundation doled out dozens of grants. The multi-chain network is now in rude health as Q3 gets underway, with new parachains regularly joining its main relay chain and sister network Kusama. If the blockchain of blockchains founded by Dr Gavin Wood can maintain this momentum, Polkadot will be a force to be reckoned with when the markets rally and the “up only” era returns. The Numbers Don’t Lie To mangle an aphorism, only when the tide goes out can you tell who’s been actively building. The recent market downturn has left many crypto projects high and dry, with no runway with which to survive what lies ahead, and no milestones of merit to tick off. While Polkadot and the Web3 Foundation (W3F) are fortunate to have large treasuries that are well managed, money alone does not a thriving blockchain make. There needs to be a tangible activity that presages signs of life. On that front, judging by its Q2 report, Polkadot can’t be accused of slacking. A string of impressive achievements reeled off by Polkadot in its Q2 report include: 400 grants now approved by the Web3 Foundation to help tech startups build new blockchains 1,400 monthly active developers, representing a 75% increase year-on-year Over 500 core contributors across Polkadot and Substrate code repositories 621 forkless upgrades across all Substrate-based blockchains, including Polkadot and Kusama parachains An average of 293 million DOT transfers per month, up from 288 million in Q1 Combined, these statistics augur well for where Polkadot is headed next. Perhaps one of the most bullish indicators for Polkadot, however, is the number of new parachains joining its network. Parachains Proliferate Parachains.info provides a fascinating snapshot of how the Polkadot ecosystem is evolving. A total of 175 projects are listed, 120 of which are building on Polkadot, with the remainder on Kusama. A neatly designed dashboard allows for filtering these projects to determine which ones have received W3F grants, are on mainnet, have a token, and a parachain granted. 11% of the total supply of DOT is now locked in parachains and crowdloans, as is a whopping 22% of KSM. The Polkadot Treasury has now funded proposals worth more than 1.4 million DOT. Polkadot’s progress hasn’t been lost on those tasked with collating blockchain data. Messari’s Q2 report into Polkadot notes: “Despite a brutal macro-environment, Polkadot’s on-chain activity was a consistent quarter over quarter. During Q2 2022, Polkadot had roughly 435,000 users.” Impressive as these numbers are, the real test of whether Polkadot can make good on its brimming potential will come in the months ahead. Major improvements and innovations are in the works, including changes to Polkadot’s governance process and deeper integration of its XCM (cross-chain messaging) protocol. Coupled with the launch of a Substrate marketplace that makes it easier to deploy Polkadot and Kusama blockchains, and there’s a lot to look forward to. Polkadot has already made great strides in getting developers and projects onboard. Now it’s time for the users to follow suit.",POSITIVE,DOT,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ICO | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/polkadot-makes-strides-as-new-parachains-join-the-party/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

7564,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=495891,1657959320,From Play2Earn to eSports: how Gladiators Honor Aims to Change the Blockchain Gaming Market,"The blockchain gaming industry is rapidly evolving and constantly innovating the mechanics of earnings. Half a year ago Play2Earn games required investments to play, and in order to take part in the competition, you had to be a token holder. Today, more and more companies are implementing Free2Play technology into their projects, allowing users to start playing for free. Some projects have gone even further and started integrating blockchain games into the esports space. Do such companies have a future in esports? Let’s look at the example of Gladiators Honor. What is Gladiators Honor? Gladiators Honor is a Play2Earn MOBA game that includes Free2Play and esport. The ecosystem of Gladiators Honor brings together play-to-earn technology, Ghon token, the NFT collection and marketplace, and its own metaverse with lands. The mission of the team is not just to create a game, but to immerse the player in the atmosphere of gladiatorial fights in ancient Rome, to provide an exciting gaming experience and to create a themed ecosystem with a friendly community to bring together gamers, streamers, creators and crypto holders from around the world. In the future, Gladiators Honor will become an esports discipline that will unite the best teams of players. The game takes place in ancient Rome, where happy and brave people lived for a long time. However, the usual way of life changed after a meteorite fell on Earth, bringing dark forces. Monsters made up their minds to destroy humanity in order to seize the territories and rule themselves. Gladiators, divided into 4 primary groups and endowed by the Gods with certain powers and skills, entered the fight against evil. Game modes: At the moment, the game has several game modes that are identical to esports disciplines. Battle royal (solo/duo) 10 players enter the Gladiator Arena to fight for survival. Sometime after the start of the match, poison gas appears on the edges of the map. It will move to the center of the map at specified intervals, narrowing the safe zone. If the player moves inside the poison gas he will take damage. Playing time: 12 minutes Team battle (3×3) Team battle mode allows teams of 3 players to fight each other. When a team member dies during a fight, a Respawn Zone is forming around him. If the gladiator enters the zone and stays there for a while, the killed teammate will revive and re-engage in combat instead of being reset. For each kill of an enemy, the fighter will receive 1 point. The team with the most points wins. Playing time: 5 minutes Senator A variety of game modes is always great, isn’t it? So in addition to the competition mode, there is an option where the player can immerse himself in land development and ownership. This will bring the resources needed to upgrade gladiators and lands, which later can be sold in the marketplace. In addition, players will be able to get a booster to speed up the experience in the game. The main characters and NFT The main characters of the game are ancient Roman gladiators, which are divided into 4 main groups. Each of the groups is patronized by a certain God: Jupiter, Neptun, Vulcan and the God Terra. Each group has 4 types of gladiators, which differ in strength, weapons and armor, the duration of the battle and the ability to earn GHON tokens. “Upon registration, each user will receive a common gladiator with minimal skills and a simple armor that can be upgraded by purchasing additional power. The player can purchase the GH Box on the marketplace in order to get a more professional warrior. Each box contains one gladiator with a different level of rarity. A higher level of heroes will allow players to earn more Ghon tokens, play more matches and receive multiple rewards,” says CEO Arsen Sharafutdinov. At the moment, there are 3 types of the rarity of gladiators: rare, epic and legendary. Ghon token Ghon is the official in-game token that will be used to exchange, accumulate, sell and buy items directly related to the game. The value of the token is guaranteed by the value of in-game resources and constant user contributions. You can learn more about token usage below: – For awards. In case of victory, players will receive tokens as a reward; – Staking. Ghon tokens can be used for staking and passive income; – In-game purchases. The player can buy weapons, armor, lands, and extra power to upgrade the gladiators. – Burning mechanism. Token burning is the process of permanently removing some crypto project tokens from circulation. We will burn a portion of the Ghon tokens from each in-game transaction to bring more value to our community. Blockchain games & esports Most existing Play2Earn games are aimed at integration into the metaverse or exist as long as there is hype for such projects. Now it is quite difficult to find a really high-quality product on the market with a perspective in the future. “We are planning to integrate Gladiators Honor into the esports sector, and later to create a separate esports discipline in which professional teams would compete. This will allow us to take the project to a new level and attract not only a crypto-oriented audience,” says Arsen Sharafutdinov. According to the CEO of the project, both the plot and the game mechanics will fully comply with all esports requirements. Developers are planning to establish partnerships with game guilds, esport teams and betting companies. At the moment, Gladiators Honor is gearing up for an NFT sale. You can find more information on the official website of Gladiators Honor.

The hidden cost of HUT's HODL strategy is shareholder dilution which saw HUT issue 74.4% new shares in 2021 and diluted shareholders' claim on assets and upside potential by 40%. Despite HUT's severe dilution, HUT's Bitcoin reserve in excess of total liabilities is still worth more than its current market, offering investors a very compelling investment value proposition. Our gripe with HUT is its above sector average business costs. We maintain our stance that HUT is just like holding Bitcoin, but only better. Introduction In our previous coverage on Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ), despite taking a liking to the company, we explicitly stated that we'll hold off our investment in it as we expect a large decline in HUT due to economic fundamentals. We also stated that HUT is fairly priced back then assuming Bitcoin stays above $50,000 and HUT achieves its targeted 6 EH/s mining capacity by mid of 2022. We did not expect Bitcoin to hold above $50,000 due to our thesis on its halving cycle . Our concerns were proven valid as the economy is nearing the official definition of a recession, Bitcoin broke below $20,000, and HUT failed to achieve its targeted 6 EH/s by mid of 2022. As a result, HUT suffered a 75% decline since our last coverage at the beginning of 2022. With HUT trading at only a $260m market cap, should investors start adding positions to HUT? HUT is Holding True to Its HODL Strategy HUT has made it clear in every quarterly report that it has retained 100% of its mined Bitcoins . As a result, HUT's Bitcoin reserve is one of the biggest in the sector with 7,406 Bitcoins as of the end of June 2022 despite trailing in mining capacity (Table 1). Tablet 1. Bitcoin Reserves and Built-up Mining Capacity ~June 2022 Company Bitcoin Reserve (June 2022) Built-up Mining Capacity Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ) 7406 2.78 Hive Blockchain ( HIVE ) 3687 (3239 BTC + 7667 ETH) 2.17 Bitfarms ( BITF ) 3,144 3.6 Iris Energy ( IREN ) -* 1 Soluna Holdings ( SLNH ) -* 1.021 Marathon Digital ( MARA ) 10.055 3.9 Riot Blockchain ( RIOT ) 6.654 4.4 Core Scientific ( CORZ ) 1,959 8.3 Source: Author * Not that we know of At this point, HUT's Bitcoin reserve is only trailing behind MARA. Even then, HUT is expected to exceed MARA in 3 quarters assuming HUT continues its 2022Q1 production numbers. According to HUT, HUT is still retaining 100% of its Bitcoin mined in June despite Bitcoin trading at the $20,000 level. This commitment cannot be understated. During this period, BITF was forced to liquidated more than half of its Bitcoin reserves . MARA had to cut operating capacity from its 3.9 EH/s built-up capacity in 2022Q1 to only 0.7 EH/s assumably due to their inefficiencies to be profitable at the current Bitcoin price. RIOT had to sell 70% of its Bitcoin mined. It is impossible for a Bitcoin mining company not to be bullish on Bitcoin. Hence, if the company believes that Bitcoin will appreciate in value in future, it does not make sense to sell it now and it is in the company's interest to retain and HODL as much Bitcoin as possible. We also use Bitcoin reserve as a key metric in our valuation framework early on. So, kudos to HUT for such commitment to its HODL strategy. How does HUT HODL 100% of Bitcoins mined? The business mining business has many costs such as electricity, hosting, wages, consultations, and etc. However, it only has 1 significant stream of revenue, the Bitcoin reward. HIVE has 3 (mining, hosting, and high performance computing ((HPC))), but revenue from hosting and HPC is negligible at this point. Logically speaking, HUT will have to sell at least part of the Bitcoins mined to cover the expenses, what is left can be retained in its reserves. However, HUT retains 100% of its Bitcoin mined. So how does HUT cover its expenses? Even with operating efficiency at the highest level, HUT would have to sell some of its Bitcoin mined to cover costs. Based on our experience, HUT would need to have superior cost control to pull this off. Else, HUT would need to use leverage or dilute shareholders. How is HUT's cost control? We find that HUT does not have superior cost control (Table 2). Since 2021Q1, HUT's operating cost per BTC mined is consistent around the $14,000 level on average. When other business costs are included (which we should), HUT's total all-in business cost is consistently around the $37,000 level on average. HUT's total all-in business cast cost (excluding depreciation and stock-based compensation) is around the $28,000 level on average. By sector standards, HUT's cost structure are considerably high (Table 3). The sector's average all-in business cost per BTC is in the $30,000 level. HUT's is 30% higher than sector average. Table 2.

Worse still, HUT's cost structure is considerably high compared to sector standards. Some might argue that HUT's cost structure can be improved as HUT scales operations. Conceptually HUT should, all other Bitcoin companies also should. But there is a strong support that cost does not reduce with scale. When we observe the sector as a whole (Table 5), scale does not reduce cost materially. The same observation can be made when observing individual mining companies. HUT's (Table 3) , BITF's (Table 6) , HIVE's , MARA's, and RIOT's costs per BTC are consistent despite increasing capacity (or mining more BTC). We explained this in detail here . Table 5.

Based on this cost structure, there is a material risk that HUT could halt its Bitcoin mining operation. It is one thing to be making losses on the overall business, and another thing to be making losses on operation. Making losses on operation implies that it is no longer viable for HUT to mine Bitcoin and should therefore halt operations, much like MARA for reducing operation from 3.9 EH/s to only 0.7 EH/s in June. HUT's operating cost is around $13,800 in 2022Q1 but averages to be around $17,000. Operating cost is primarily electricity cost but also includes costs related to personnel, network monitoring, software licensing, equipment repair, and maintenance, which are all critical to the Bitcoin mining operation. On the other hand, Bitcoin is trading at around the $20,000 level and we expect Bitcoin to decline to as low of $10,000 based on its decade-old halving cycle and economic fundamentals. Should Bitcoin reach this price level, HUT will risk halting mining operations temporarily. Is HUT's HODL Strategy Funded through Liabilities and Dilution? We think that's the case, but primarily dilution. HUT's total liabilities were consistently around $20mil up til 2021Q3. In 2021Q4 and 2022Q1, HUT's total liabilities suddenly increased to about $150mil and $100mil respectively. This large increase in total liabilities is mainly contributed by warrants liability ($100mil) and loans payable ($30mil). Warrants are used to raise capital. HUT can raise capital by selling warrants to investors and raise another round of capital when investors exercise the warrants to buy shares from HUT. But the warranty liability is not the data that gave away how HUT funds its HODL strategy and expansion plan. It is the shares outstanding (Figure 1). HUT had just diluted investors 74.4% (increase in shares outstanding) just in 2021. This means that investors lost 40% of HUT's future upside or their claim on HUT's assets and profits or in 2021. Comparatively, BITF shareholders suffered 38% dilution (increase in shares outstanding) while CORZ has 66% potential dilution (increase in shares outstanding) risk over an unspecified amount of time. This momentum is likely to continue in 2022 as HUT announced its at-the-market (ATM) equity offering program to raise $65mil of capital. If HUT were to conclude its ATM offering as of the time of writing, HUT would need to issue additional 42.7mil shares or ~25% dilution (increase in shares outstanding) based on 2021Q4 shares outstanding. On a side note, HUT just raised CAD$32.5mil in 2022Q1 but we're unsure whether the capital raised is part of the ATM offering announced. Table 7.

HUT suffered 74.4% in 2021 ( HUT ) Verdict We showed that HUT is not profitable when Bitcoin is trading below $40,000. This means that its market cap relative to hard assets is more important for HUT to be investable. The total value of assets (Cash, reserves, plant and equipment, deposits and prepaids) ($633mil) in excess of total liabilities ($79.23, could be lesser as majority is warrant liability) is $553.77mil. This is more than 2x higher than its market cap. This safety of margin even exceeded IREN's 88% . Although its business efficiency isn't as good as HIVE's, this safety of margin should be able to compel many investors to invest in HUT. However, the main problem for us is its dilution problem. HUT's HODL strategy is a double edge sword. On one hand, HUT is in poised to take advantage of any Bitcoin upside movement. On the other hand, HUT is severely diluting shareholders. 74.4% increase in shares outstanding equates to about 40% less shareholder claim on assets or return. Theoretically, this implies that even if HUT manages to increase its market cap increase by 40%, its share price wouldn't increase. To put this into perspective, the S&P provides investors only 8%-10% return annually. But if Bitcoin appreciates faster than HUT's dilution, this shouldn't be a problem anymore. At the moment, HUT's Bitcoin reserve in excess of liability is already worth more than its market cap. This means that investors are getting its cash, plant and equipment, deposits and prepaids, and businesses (mining, hosting, HPC) for free. This is indeed very hard to ignore. Therefore, we maintain our stance that HUT is just like holding Bitcoin, but only better . Due to our $10,000 Bitcoin thesis , we'll continue to delay our investment into HUT alongside HIVE and IREN .
