14746803,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542007,1689030045,"Bulls Remain Resilient Despite Litecoin’s Fall Below $100, Key Levels To Watch","Despite facing a challenging period in recent months, the price of Litecoin has demonstrated a significant upward trajectory. In June, LTC experienced a decline to $71; however, the bulls subsequently took charge and initiated a recovery. Related Reading: Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Says BTC Is Overpriced, Decline Soon? Nevertheless, over the past week, LTC’s progress slowed, with the coin retracing below the $100 mark and experiencing a loss of approximately 12%. On the daily chart, LTC witnessed a 1.5% decline. Although the coin experienced a significant devaluation on the weekly chart, the bullish sentiment remains. The technical analysis of Litecoin indicates that the bulls are currently dominant, with a minor retracement in demand and accumulation. As Bitcoin also retraced on its chart recently, other altcoins, including Litecoin, observed depreciation. Currently, Litecoin is in a crucial price zone ranging from $90 to $94. Sustaining a price above the $94 mark is expected to provide impetus for LTC to resume its upward trajectory. The market capitalization of LTC reflects a higher presence of sellers compared to buyers in the market. Litecoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart As of the time of writing, LTC was priced at $95. The altcoin attempted to increase in value after successfully holding the $94 support level. The immediate resistance for LTC was observed at $97. The bullish sentiment remained intact for LTC as it managed to stay above the bearish order block (marked in red) formed in mid-April. Surpassing the $97 mark would propel Litecoin to challenge the $100 threshold and potentially move beyond the upper boundary of the bearish order block at $103. Conversely, if LTC fails to maintain its current level, there is a risk of breaching the $94 support, which may invite the bears back into the market. Technical Analysis Following its surge above the $100 threshold, LTC experienced a pullback as it entered an overbought condition. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remained slightly above the half-line, indicating that buyers still maintained control in the market, particularly as the coin held above the crucial support level. Furthermore, LTC remained above the 20-Simple Moving Average line, signaling buyers were driving the price momentum. LTC needs to surpass the immediate resistance level in the upcoming trading sessions to sustain its upward trajectory. LTC has experienced notable capital inflows, indicating that investor interest has remained positive, as evidenced by the Chaikin Money Flow indicator. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharks And Whales Go On $2.15 Billion Buying Spree, Is It Time To Sell? This indicates a sustained bullish outlook on the chart. Furthermore, the Bollinger Bands, which reflect price volatility and fluctuation, are currently wide open.

42410209,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcVD7E,1689029413,Bitcoin Falls Back Below $31K After Late Monday Surge,"Bitcoin returned briefly on Monday to its recent, loftier heights above $31,000 before dipping slightly below the threshold.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $30,690, up almost 2% over the past 24 hours as investors seemed to regain the enthusiasm they held following spot bitcoin ETF filings by BlackRock and other financial services giants in mid June and other mildly crypto-friendly events during the month.  BTC last traded above $31,000 on Thursday. It sank along with other assets amid renewed inflationary worries raised primarily by an unexpectedly robust ADP private sector jobs report, even sinking below its most recent support of $30,000. But those concerns seemed to vanish, and after lingering just above this level, bitcoin jumped more than 2% over a roughly 90-minute period during the afternoon before retreating.  Bitcoin has risen 20% over the past month, much of the gains coming after the spot BTC filings. A report by British multinational bank, Standard Chartered Bank, early Wednesday (ET) said that bitcoin could hit $50,000 by year's end and over $120,000 by the close of 2024.  Read More: Bitcoin Could Rise to $120K by End-2024: Standard Chartered  ""Today’s lift in digital assets comes from several June tailwinds that are only now being digested,"" Mark Connors, head of research for digital asset management firm 3iQ, wrote to CoinDesk. ""June price action was BTC dominant due to the slew of spot BTC ETF filings,"" he wrote, also noting favorable comments about the application by former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Jay Clayton.  In a CNBC appearance Monday, Clayton said that if the filings addressed certain protections that bitcoin futures ETFs include, that it would be difficult to ""resist approving a (spot) bitcoin ETF.""  Connors wrote that investors may also be slowly warming to the possible approval of the Congressional Digital Assets Market Structure and Investor Protection Act, which would establish whether a digital asset is decentralized. ""If passed into law, such a determination can be meaningful as most developers do not want to join a centralized entity bound by securities laws,"" he wrote.  Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,890, up 1.8% from Sunday, same time. Other major cryptos turned from red to increase or jumped more squarely into positive territory with MATIC and ADA, the tokens of the smart contracts platforms Polygon and Cardano, rising more than 6% and 2%, respectively. BNB, the native crypto of the Binance exchange recently rose over 4%.  The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, was recently up 1.9%.  Equity indexes rebounded from a rare 2023 off week with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both ticking up as investors looked hopefully toward Wednesday's June U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI). The CPI sank to 4% in May, down from the 9% reading of almost a year ago.  Consensus estimates call for the index to fall below 4%, although Edward Moya, senior analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in a note Monday that CPI could tumble to 2.8% even as housing prices remain inflated. The potentially contradictory data and last week's confounding jobs data (nonfarm payrolls sank slightly) could complicate the U.S. central bank's much anticipated decision to raise the interest rate later this month.  The Federal Reserve probability tracker is currently forecasting a more than 90% likelihood of a 25 basis point rate hike (bps), but critics of the Fed's more than year-long monetary hawkishness believe bankers are overstepping and risk casting the economy into a recession. ""Even if we get a hot report, the Fed is locked into delivering a quarter-point rate rise,"" Moya wrote. ""Following last month’s pause, the Fed seems positioned to remain aggressive with signaling tightening until we see a much more meaningful slowdown.""  Aggressive rate increases have weighed heavily on crypto markets. Moya expects bitcoin to remain at about $30,000 ""as Wall Street awaits any US Bitcoin ETF update, and as market expectations for a 25 basis point hike at the next Fed meeting seems very likely.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/10/bitcoin-falls-below-31k-after-late-monday-surge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/acc2d5bd29e3cfe4245c2c61853dcb211b61c153-1700x1070.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

14745626,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542033,1689027587,The One Ingredient Missing From A Full-Bore Bitcoin Bull Run,"Bitcoin price is showing resilience in the face of adversity and is up nearly 100% from bear market lows. However, it has yet to show signs of an undeniable bull market as it has in the past. That’s because of just one missing ingredient, according to a new BTCUSD weekly chart. Bitcoin Bullish Momentum: The Missing Ingredient When cooking, or especially baking, missing even one ingredient can change the end result of the desired dish or dessert. For example, sweets without any sugar just aren’t that sweet. A prime cut of steak doesn’t quite taste as good if it hasn’t had a proper seasoning and sear. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reaches Longest Stretch Ever Without A Bull Run Similarly, a cryptocurrency bull market without the weekly Relative Strength Index at overbought levels, just simply isn’t a Bitcoin bull run. Historically, Bitcoin reaching oversold conditions has been a requirement for a full-bore bullish impulse. The 1W RSI is currently lacking that key signal appears to be preventing the market from pushing dramatically higher. It’s been a long time since bulls had a turn | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Why Overbought RSI Is Required For A Full-Bore BTCUSD Rally The term “full-bore” is rather fitting, with Merriam-Webster defining it as “with maximum effort or speed.” The Relative Strength Index provides a read on momentum, by taking a measurement of the speed of price changes within a specific time period. When prices are moving exceedingly fast in one direction, maximum buying or selling effort is required. This is precisely why reaching overbought or oversold conditions can lead to a reversal – it takes consistently increasing effort to maintain maximum speed. However, in cryptocurrencies, the speculative nature of their pricing can result in extreme phases of FOMO where conditions remain overbought at length. Such phases, called a bullish impulse, show corresponding overbought levels in the RSI historically in BTCUSD. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin Dominance Hints At A Surprise Altcoin Season Ahead This particular ingredient is still missing currently in 2023, after is last appearing in 2021 and prior to that 2019. During the 2017 bull run in crypto, Bitcoin repeatedly reached overbought levels, only to return to the zone as it kept soaring higher and higher.

42410208,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcVD0c,1689025587,"Apple May Not Like It, but ‘Zapple Pay’ Finds Workaround for Bitcoin Tipping on Damus","Last month, Apple (AAPL) threatened to remove the Bitcoin-friendly social media app Damus from its App Store for allowing users to tip or “zap” each other with bitcoin (BTC) on content posted in the app – a prohibited practice the tech giant reportedly considers equivalent to selling digital media.  Damus creator William Casarin eventually conceded, resolving the standoff by removing the app’s ability to send zaps on posts or notes; users were still able to tip each other at the profile level.  Read more: Bitcoin-Friendly App Damus Avoids Apple Deplatforming After 2-Week Battle Over 'Zaps' Tipping  But now, a pair of independent developers have come up with what appears to be a workaround – and they believe that this time, Apple may be all but powerless to stop them.  On July 6, barely two weeks after Casarin’s concession, the new Zapple Pay service went live – the brainchild of two Bitcoin developers who say they have no affiliation to Casarin or Damus. They say they discovered a way to enable zaps via emojis.  Since emojis are allowed on posts, the app’s users can once again send zaps on posts, despite Apple’s restrictions.  The two Bitcoin developers behind Zapple Pay are Ben Carman and Paul Miller. The pair are also co-founders of Mutiny wallet, a browser-based, Lightning-enabled and self-custodial bitcoin wallet.  Users who want to try the new service simply provide their Nostr public key (npub), an emoji, and a link to a wallet. Nostr is an acronym for “notes and other stuff transmitted by relays.”  “When they react to a post with that emoji, we initiate a zap to that post,” Carman told CoinDesk.  Since Zapple Pay is a third-party service, it’s not clear if Apple can or will take any action against Damus and engage in a game of Whac-A-Mole with Carman and Miller.  “If Apple is that petty, then there's no real appeasing them in the long term,” Miller said. “We could build the exact same functionality on top of any social network.”  Casarin, the Damus creator, insists that he had no role in the development of Zapple Pay, nor any affiliation with the developers.  Damus is popular with bitcoiners, partly because of the tipping feature, and advocates for the cryptocurrency had chimed in on its behalf, after Apple’s crackdown. Former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, whose current company Block (SQ) is largely Bitcoin-focused, went as far as calling out Apple CEO Tim Cook on the matter.  Jack Dorsey weighs in  On July 8, Dorsey appeared to acknowledge the efforts of the Zapple Pay developers, posting on the Damus app, ""Zaps always find a way,"" with a link to the team's website.  Prior to forcing Casarin to remove zaps on posts from Damus, Apple recommended he enable zaps that use its mobile payment service Apple Pay instead.  “Apple banning note zaps is like trying to ban hyperlinks in browsers,” Casarin told CoinDesk. “It's just a piece of technology and they have zero power to stop it.”  CoinDesk reached out to Apple for comment and its spokesperson had not responded at the time of publication.  “We could build the same thing for Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,” Carman said. “So if they go after Damus, then we'll replicate it for Twitter and try to force their hand.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/07/10/apple-may-not-like-it-but-zapple-pay-finds-workaround-for-bitcoin-tipping-on-damus,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/be64fbac5d30a56b893ea8494da09e1ac728e577-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

14743443,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541999,1689022828,"More People Talking About XRP, Will Bulls Break Above $0.60?","On-chain data compiled by Santiment, an analytics platform, shows that more people are discussing XRP, the native token of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), per statistics captured on July 10. In their assessment, the spike in social chatter, translating to higher social dominance, will most likely draw demand for the crypto asset that has recently been under selling pressure but firm. The rise in XRP’s social dominance is the highest since May, suggesting that market sentiment could change. Despite this increment, XRP prices are relatively muted, stable on the last trading day, but unable to break above $0.50, a psychological reaction level. XRP Social Dominance Rising, Will Prices Rally? Over the past few weeks, Santiment data shows that XRP’s social volume drawn from social media activity has been relatively low. This could be due to several factors, the main one being the lack of significant updates on the legal dispute between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Breakout Alert: Potential 30% Rally Looming Beyond the lawsuit pitting the blockchain company and the regulator who has been, in recent days, cracking the whip on crypto firms, crypto prices have been soft, and XRP has been no exception. To illustrate, although the coin is firm, bulls failed to push prices above the $0.58 level. Presently, XRP is down roughly 20% from H1 2023 highs. Primary support is at around $0.45, marking June 2023 lows. Comparing the current surge in social dominance to previous instances in May, Santiment draws attention to the correlation between increased social activity and XRP price expansions. When XRP’s social dominance peaked at 7.4% in May, prices, the analytics platform observed, rose in lock-step. Meanwhile, when XRP’s social dominance decreased in May, its price also fell. Therefore, while the social dominance of XRP is firm in early July, it remains to be seen whether bulls will flow back and pump prices higher toward the $0.60 liquidation line. Bullish Signals According to Santiment, rising XRP social dominance in the current environment when prices are weak could signal that bulls may offer support in upcoming sessions. In turn, this may inject optimism and momentum considering the recent fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) in crypto primarily due to the SEC’s lawsuits against two of the world’s most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance and Coinbase, in June. Related Reading: XRP FUD Spikes, Will This Trigger A Price Reversal? The SEC alleges that among other coins, ADA, the native currency of Cardano, and ALGO, the token priming the Algorand ecosystem, are unregistered securities.

42410220,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcVDeI,1689022758,Crypto Startup Arkham Has Apparently Been Doxxing Users for Months,"Crypto data firm Arkham Intelligence stirred controversy Monday by announcing a new service aimed at unmasking the owners of digital wallets, angering privacy-focused crypto advocates.  It turns out Arkham has already been leaking its own customers’ private information, a revelation that also seems to have emerged Monday, putting a spotlight on Arkham’s own approach to user privacy just as it was rolling out a service meant to unmask crypto wallet owners on a massive scale.  The issue stems from the way Arkham set up its weblink referral program. Users of Arkham’s wallet tracking dashboard can invite others onto the platform by sharing their unique referral URL. Those URLs appear to end with a meaningless jumble of characters. In reality, they’re an easy-to-decipher version of the user’s email address written in Base64, which is trivial to decode.  Arkham did not reply to a request for comment.  Arkham Intelligence builds a popular service for tracking crypto transactions and identifying the owners of crypto wallets. It’s hardly the only wallet labeling service, but on Monday Arkham unveiled the “Intel Exchange,” a marketplace for placing bounties on the identity of anonymous crypto wallets.  While wallet labeling services such as Nansen and Chainalysis have long rankled privacy-focused corners of the crypto universe, Arkham’s plans for a bounty-focused marketplace hit a particular chord.  Regarding the separate issue with referrals, anyone who shared their Arkham link may have inadvertently put their anonymity (or at least their email address) at risk. The pseudonymous m4gicpotato, a contributor to the privacy blockchain Beam, posted about the issue on Twitter on Monday, where it quickly went viral. M4gicpotato described themselves as a privacy advocate who has worked in crypto under various names since 2017.  “As a staunch privacy advocate, I believe these tools infringe upon user privacy,” m4gicpotato said in a Telegram interview with CoinDesk. They said they started looking into Arkham after Binance announced it would host the public sale of ARKM, which Arkham described as an intel-to-earn token.  “I was quite taken aback when Binance and [CEO Changpeng Zhao] chose to endorse Arkham, especially so soon after the global delisting of Beam and other privacy coins in the EU,” m4gicpotato said.  The choice to encode user emails in Base64 “just added another layer of incredulity to the situation,” m4gicpotato added.  It’s unclear how many users could be affected by the setup. In theory, anyone who generated a referral link and shared it sent their email address into the ether. Some users have shared their links on Twitter.  But the setup has been this way since at least December. Back then, Arkham’s Twitter account shared a referral code for the private beta. The code’s URL includes the Base64 version of the CEO’s email address.",NEGATIVE,ARKM,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | BNB | ARKM,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/07/10/crypto-startup-arkham-has-apparently-been-doxxing-privacy-obsessed-users-for-months,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/100a18558750a56cbf338f0dc7d309d0c9511bf4-2372x1334.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As the demand for decentralized finance (DeFi) grows, PancakeSwap aims to offer users a user-friendly platform to trade their assets without intermediaries. PancakeSwap And Google Cloud Collaboration Moreover, PancakeSwap leverages Google Kubernetes Engine to scale its nodes quickly and accurately predict traffic spikes with the help of the PreditKube solution from Dysnix. Dysnix’s PreditKube solution helped PancakeSwap accurately predict traffic spikes and automate the up-and-down scaling of blockchain nodes ahead of time to manage the anticipated traffic surge. This approach ensured that PancakeSwap’s infrastructure could handle a fluctuating number of requests with high scalability, maintaining an uptime of 99.99%. Related Reading: Arkham’s New Crypto Intel Trading Platform: A Game Changer For Traders? Dysnix says their PreditKube solution accurately predicts more than 90% of traffic spikes on PancakeSwap. By automating the up-and-down scaling of nodes, PancakeSwap managed the anticipated traffic surge and reduced its infrastructure costs by more than 30%. One of the critical challenges for any trading platform is ensuring the security of smart contracts. PancakeSwap works with various audit firms to identify potential loopholes and leverages Cloud Armor to filter sensitive data. With its smart contracts secured, PancakeSwap aims to expand its services by adding more chains and exploring non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Moreover, to improve users’ trading experience, PancakeSwap plans to leverage BigQuery to manage and analyze historical blockchain data. By simplifying complex data, PancakeSwap aims to make blockchain trading accessible to everyone. With Google Cloud’s fully managed services, PancakeSwap’s engineers can focus on developing new features and improving the user experience rather than dealing with infrastructure issues. Chef Jojo, Technical Lead at PancakeSwap, stated: At one point, we had more than one billion requests on the BNB Chain, but this is changing all the time due to the BNB network changes, among other variables. With Google Kubernetes Engine, we can quickly scale up when there are many requests. Google Cloud Boosts CAKE Token Value PancakeSwap’s native token, CAKE, has seen a 3.9% increase in value within the last 24 hours following the announcement of its partnership with Google Cloud. Currently, CAKE is trading at $1.517 after being range-bound between $1.454 and $1.481 for the past four days. The partnership with Google Cloud has provided the much-needed momentum for CAKE to break out of this range and continue its upward trend. However, CAKE is now facing a significant resistance level at $1.525, which has not been surpassed since July 6th. On the other hand, PancakeSwap’s market cap (circulating) is currently at $327.94 million, representing a decline of 1.10% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, its fully diluted market cap stands at $1.13 billion, representing a decline of 5.73%. According to data from Token Terminal, PancakeSwap’s revenue for the past 30 days is at $1.41 million, marking a decrease of 31.55% from the previous period. Similarly, its annualized revenue is $17.11 million, representing a decrease of 39.79%. Related Reading: US Presidential Candidate Robert F.

Oulahyane faces multiple counts of wire fraud, the use of an unauthorized access device for the alleged crime and aggravated identity theft, which occurred in September 2021.  ""Oulahyane adapted [an] old tool for use in a new and developing arena – the crypto space,"" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement.  The alleged scammer used his fake OpenSea site to lure a Manhattan NFT owner to register with it and hand over the seed phrase to his digital wallet, which Oulahyane then used to transfer cryptocurrency and a number of NFTs to his control and sell them. Those NFTs included one from the ""Bored Ape Yacht Club"" series worth roughly $92,000 at publication time.  Oulahyane is now in custody in Morocco.

14740028,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542010,1689015628,Analyst: Expect Altcoin Season After Bitcoin Halves In 2024,"A crypto analyst on Twitter expects altcoin prices to be muted in the second half of 2023. Data indicate that the fate of altcoins and the possibility of an “alt season” is highly dependent on the performance of Bitcoin. Being the foremost cryptocurrency and market leader, according to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin’s impact on altcoins cannot be underestimated. Altcoins Are In Accumulation Phase, Waiting On Bitcoin? In his assessment, altcoins are currently in the “accumulation phase,” which has kept the sector at a market cap between $290 billion and $460 billion for the past few trading months. This trend, he forecasts, will likely continue until next year, when Bitcoin is expected to halve its block reward to 3.125 BTC. Considering the performance of Bitcoin after past halving events, the cryptocurrency could see further profits as the event nears. This, in turn, factoring in the direct correlation between Bitcoin and altcoins, will likely trigger an “altcoin season.” Related Reading: PEPE Bulls Losing Steam? Fatigue Appears To Undermine Price Rally To cement his market preview, he shared a screenshot depicting the total market capitalization of altcoins excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, revealing extended periods of sideways trading during previous bear markets. Extending from this outlook, the analyst expects altcoins’ price movements to be limited until after the halving event, as seen in the chart below. Historically, Bitcoin surges tend to support altcoins, a trend observed in recent cycles. Altcoin’s relatively thin liquidity often leads to price gains outpacing the more liquid BTC. Conversely, whenever Bitcoin prices crash, altcoins tend to collapse faster. Most Altcoins Are Weak? In recent months, Bitcoin has been firm, rising 80% in H1 2023 after prices bottomed up in late 2022. On the other hand, despite the direct correlation, most altcoins remain suppressed, down from 2021 peaks. To illustrate, coins like ADA, SOL, DOGE, ALGO, and others are down roughly 85% from 2021 peaks and remain under pressure when writing on July 10. Regulatory headwinds and generally suppressed market conditions have worsened sentiment, diffusing upside momentum. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently alleged that several altcoins, including SOL and ADA, are securities, a comment that saw prices dump in June. Related Reading: Stellar (XLM) Sheds 13% As Bearish Sentiment Takes Over The only outlier among altcoins is XRP. Optimism in the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC has supported the coin, forcing prices to diverge from other altcoins. Even so, the final ruling will likely significantly impact prices and volatility. Currently, XRP is trading below $0.50 but is up roughly 45% from 2022 lows and is firm, trading in a bullish formation above $0.45. XRP will likely tear higher if a favorable ruling supports Ripple’s assertion that XRP, a coin they use in their On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) platform, is not a security but a utility like Bitcoin. A ruling in support of the SEC would trigger a sell-off, possibly unwinding recent gains.

42410215,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcVDNl,1689013881,What Mastodon’s Critical Bug Fixes Say About Crypto’s Security Vulnerabilities,"Several critical bugs on the Twitter-like social media platform Mastodon were patched last week, after researchers funded by the Mozilla Foundation tipped their hat to the vulnerabilities. The situation shows one of the fundamental tradeoffs in open-source software development: that publicly available code can be reviewed and exploited by anyone.  Sometimes that means bugs are found by so-called white hat hackers, and sometimes they’re left open to be exploited. In Mastodon’s case, Mozilla paid German security firm Cure53 to pen test the social network, after announcing plans it would be using Mastodon for some corporate communications.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Especially in the post-Elon-Musk-buyout Twitter era, Mastodon has become one of the most popular decentralized applications used by everyday folk. Mastodon calls itself a “federation” because it consists of several thousand separate ""instances” that serve people content (unlike at companies like Twitter or Facebook, which maintain their own servers). Anyone can run their own or ask to join another instance, which can set their own moderation standards.  Not much has been revealed about the five bugs that were patched, though independent security researcher Kevin Beaumont, writing on Mastodon, said one potential exploit dubbed #TootRoot could have given hackers root access to Mastodon instances – which could have caused all types of issues including compromised accounts and other phishing schemes.  See also: Crypto Hackers Tend to Return Stolen Money: TRM Labs  Mastodon gGmbH, the organization that maintains Mastodon’s open source software, rated one other bug as critical and the three others as high and medium in severity. Large servers were also sent pre-announcements about the security holes in recent weeks, so they could be ready to quickly deploy a patch when it went live, according to Ars Technica.  As far as I can tell, none of Mastodon’s 14.5 million users were affected by the bad lines of code, which seem to have been unexploited. But the situation does raise some uncomfortable concerns, including how long the critical issues would have sat dormant had Mozilla not been interested in paying to see if Mastodon was secure. And whether a bad actor could have gotten to it first.  These are live issues in the world of free and open source software, including (and perhaps especially) in crypto. Putting aside the challenges of making sure everyone downloads a patch or is running the latest software – (if you’re a Mastodon user, check that the instance you're using is on version 4.1.3 or later or hound the server to update) – the security of shared networks is totally subject to market forces.  Financial incentives cut both ways for hackers, who can sometimes receive a bug bounty for properly disclosing an issue or turn around and sell the malicious information on a darknet market. And there isn’t always a Mozilla out there willing to pay for in-depth audits to make sure these systems are secure.  The problem is only complicated by crypto, which turns applications into “multimillion dollar bug bounties” or grab bags for hackers looking to make a quick buck. Some $3.1 billion was stolen from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols alone last year. And even when protocol foundations or users banded together pay for code reviews, it’s not always clear an auditor’s stamp of approval can be trusted (often due as much to incompetence as greed).  See also: Calling a Hack an Exploit Minimizes Human Error | Opinion  Diyahir Campos, a crypto user and developer who says he lost out after the multi-million dollar attack of Euler Finance, recently revealed a DeFi “circuit breaker” that would pause protocols seeing abnormal withdrawals. This would be an “opt-in thing,” which admittedly wouldn’t offer users complete security but could minimize the amount of money lost in hacks.  Solutions like this are admirable, even if there are no easy fixes to crypto’s problems (and definitely not a “one-size-fits-all” option). And, of course, there’s a baseline risk in using any computer program whether or not it’s open source. Lest we forget even the most competent seeming institutions like the U.S. Department of Defense or Microsoft are not immune to catastrophic bugs.  The FOSS community fosters a real culture of solidarity and shared responsibility, where the respect garnered from finding and disclosing issues is often worth more than the money they could have earned. Let that be cold comfort to crypto, whether or not institutions like Mozilla are on the way to adoption.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/07/10/what-mastodons-critical-bug-fixes-say-about-cryptos-security-vulnerabilities,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/32b4266dcf71001eef69ab8e2ad343b5c2c9437c-1572x1040.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Hence, tokens like Stellar (XLM) and Stacks (STX) struggle to stay in the game. Uwerx has breezed through many successful presale stages, rapidly selling out and reaching new heights daily. Stacks (STX) Launches Stacks 2.1 Stacks (STX) aims to create a more secure, decentralized internet owned by users. The Layer-2 blockchain provides a scalable infrastructure for building decentralized applications (dApps) and performing decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions on the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain. The Stacks (STX) platform improves the base protocol by introducing smart contract functionality for Bitcoin (BTC) users. Furthermore, it enables users to create and trade valuable non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on popular digital marketplaces. Moreover, Stacks (STX) also provides the underbanked access to vital financial services, like micropayments and loans, without interference from governments or other intermediaries. The blockchain recently released a significant upgrade in March 2023. Stacks (STX) launched the Stacks 2.1 upgrade to improve the speed and volume of DeFi transactions. The launch caused the STX token's price to surge 14% in less than 24hrs, reaching $1.27. However, the token has steadily declined since March after reaching more than $1.5. STX stayed at $0.9 since April but has now fallen even more, trading at $0.6 currently. Stellar (XLM) Partners With Anchain.ai Stellar (XLM) is a decentralized payment system based on the Stellar Consensus Protocol. The blockchain enables the exchange of traditional crypto coins and fiat money across international borders. Furthermore, Stellar (XLM) recently partnered with an AI-powered security company, Anchain.ai. This integration is aimed at enhancing cross-border payment security. Stellar (XLM) seeks to provide more accessible security tools to create a secure developer ecosystem. The XLM token has been on a constant decline since March after it reached $0.13. The coin took a significant fall to settle at $0.7 in April. Stellar (XLM) is experiencing a decline in Q2 2023, making only very minuscule backward and forward leaps. The XLM token has been stuck in the $0.8 range since last week. Holders are looking wide-eyed for appreciation, while investors are watching and wondering if now would be an excellent time to get in the game. However, experts are predicting an exaggerated dip, even with the steadiness of the token. Uwerx (WERX) Presale Is Breaking New Heights This new crypto project focuses on the freelancer economy. With freelancing becoming widely adopted, even by big companies like Google, the project is on the right track. The project has undergone vetting and auditing by SolidProof and InterFi Network to ensure transparency. Uwerx aims to provide a secure, fast, and accessible platform for freelancers and their clients. Uwerx charges a low transaction fee of 1%, while other freelancing platforms, such as Upwork and Fiverr, charge 10%-20%. The project is in its fifth funding stage and has a 72.5 million token allocation, with WERX priced at $0.0315 per token. The total presale token allocation increased to 57% from 45%, creating more opportunities for early supporters. The hard cap presale will occur on 31st July 2023. Uwerx recently announced preparations to transition to the Beta version to enable users to start testing. The Alpha version of the platform was launched last week. The launch came with Landing Page and Sign-Up Page. However, the platform has been recently updated with more pages, including the Login, Forgot Password, Freelancer or Client Initiation, Job Creation Process, My Activity, and Initial Step of Job Creation and Initial Step Of Finding Talent pages. Users can also send helpful feedback to Uwerx through an email, feedback@uwerx.network. Uwerx provides a Uwerx Vault to help secure users' tokens. Users can store their tokens for a specified time and earn rewards using the Vault. Moreover, the team has locked the developer's liquidity, which was set for 25 years after the presale. The lock happened after 82.8% of the community voted on an instant lock. Also, 92.8% of the community voted for a test airdrop to enable users to validate their wallet addresses. The project has an excellent presale run, and with that, the developers have reduced the token allocation from 8% to 7%, increasing investor confidence in the project. The Uwerx developers utilized an agile methodology approach to achieve presale success. The approach uses rapid development and accelerated deployment through feedback. Stellar (XLM) and Stacks (STX) give holders much anxiety with their current standings as the tokens seem to be rolling downhill. Fortunately, Uwerx is pushing a very successful presale run. Uwerx presents better features and investment potential and has shown a clean record to investors with a successful presale and increased value of the WERX token.Take advantage of Uwerx's current discounted price of $0.047725 with a purchase bonus of 15%. However, be aware that the price will rise to $0.05245 by today (Monday 10th) at 18:00 UTC. It is recommended to act quickly and make your WERX token purchase today.

However, investors have remained undeterred by the cryptocurrency’s movements and have rather chosen to continue to accumulate. This accumulation trend is more prominent in the shark and whale BTC addresses which have added 71,000 BTC to their holdings. Bitcoin Sharks And Whales Buy $2.15 Billion Worth Of BTC According to the on-chain data aggregator platform Santiment, the Bitcoin sharks and whales have been at one of their most active points over the last month. The data aggregator took to Twitter to share that these shark and whale addresses have bought a significant amount of BTC, amounting to $2.15 billion in less than a month. Related Reading: Analysts Puts Bitcoin At $125,000 By 2024, How Is This Possible? The shark and whale addresses being referred to in this report are addresses that hold between 10-10,000 BTC. This puts the lower band of these holders at $300,000 with the upper band sitting as high as $300 million. This means that these are the addresses that have the means to buy a large number of BTC. Santiment reveals that these shark and whale addresses started accumulating on June 17, and by July 8, they had added a total of 71,000 BTC to their holdings. A look at the Bitcoin price chart over the last month shows that these addresses started accumulating the digital asset at a low price of around $27,000. Then they continued to purchase coins all through to the $30,000-$31,000 range. Sharks and whales buy $2.15 billion worth of BTC | Source: Santiment The biggest spike in their balances during this period looks to have happened around June 26, when the chart shows that BTC was trending at $30,300. In total, their holdings went from just under 12.95 million BTC to 13.02 million BTC in the span of 21 days. Is It Time To Sell? Going by the chart shared by Santiment, it looks like these Bitcoin shark and whale addresses have already made some sell-offs, which could point to there being a cool-off period before they start selling again. There were significant dips in their holdings toward the end of June, as well as on July 7, marking sell-off points. BTC price reclaims $30,300 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Also, it is important to note that at the prices that these addresses accumulated most of their holdings, they are barely in any profit. So with the BTC price still hovering around $30,000, it sits close to the average at which these addresses are bought at, which is likely around the $29,000 range. So for now, these addresses could likely hold for better prices before selling. Related Reading: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Says Bitcoin Is Digital Gold, So What’s The Digital Silver? If this is the case, then it is possibly a good time to get into the market as these large holders obviously see it as a good entry point. However, these large addresses can move the market and if there is a mass sell-off from them, then the price of BTC could tank. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $30,300, which translates to a 0.09% decline in the last 24 hours.

42410216,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcVDR4,1689010291,"""What Is ActivityPub?"" Understanding the Social-Media Protocol Meta’s Threads Plans to Use","The new Twitter-like social media service from Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, Threads, was released in July 2023 and quickly racked up tens of millions of downloads. At launch, it was, like Twitter before it, a walled garden; a Threads account only allows for posting and reading content on Threads. But, Meta promises, it won’t be that way forever. Threads customers will eventually be able to interact with other platforms in the so-called fediverse like Mastodon (an open-source Twitter replacement) and vice versa.  A protocol called ActivityPub is what will enable this, Meta says. While Twitter runs on a private and proprietary technology platform, ActivityPub promises a decentralized future for social media that, in theory, gives users much greater freedom to flee a service they don’t like (a position many Twitter users currently desire as they disagree with the direction Elon Musk is taking the company).  So what exactly is ActivityPub, how does it work and what do you need to know about it? We’ve got you covered.  See Also: Threads is Libra and Meta All Over Again  What is ActivityPub?  ActivityPub is a standard established by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the group responsible for technologies that provide the basic plumbing of the internet. It does two big things:  Different services can speak to each other (like, in the future, Threads and Mastodon),  Users can take their data (the list of accounts they follow, etc.) with them from service to service.  With an ActivityPub-powered service, users control their data, content and audience, letting them take that information with them wherever they decide to go. Instead of having to rebuild followers and find out who to follow on each new platform, you can take all that with you to any new social media platform supporting ActivityPub.  This data portability is a large shift from the social media status quo driven by incumbents like Facebook (which, like Threads, is run by Meta), Twitter, YouTube and TikTok, which are run by centralized companies that harvest user data and control the content users provide.  Open social networking means that the social apps built on it are interoperable, so instead of having to re-upload a different version of a post for each platform, you can post once and it can be seen, shared and read across any app or program built on or that supports ActivityPub throughout the fediverse (the term used to describe the family of interconnected ActivityPub-powered services). We’ll get more into that next.  So what is the fediverse?  If you go to any Threads user’s profile page, you’ll see a gray button with the words “threads.net” next to their username. If you tap on the button, you’ll receive this pop-up:  “Soon, you’ll be able to follow and interact with people on other fediverse platforms, like Mastodon. They can also find people on Threads using full usernames, like @[username]@threads.net.”  If you were one of the people who tested out or migrated to Mastodon after Musk’s 2022 acquisition of Twitter, the term fediverse may be familiar even if it’s meaning remains murky.  Fediverse is a portmanteau combining federated + universe. So, essentially, the “fediverse” is the universe of server-to-server social networks, which is described as a federated system. For those in the U.S., it’s the same way states make up the whole of the country; each state is independent but unite in important ways to make up a country. In a federated social network like Mastodon, each server is independent but they can share posts, information, users and together all the servers make up the whole network we call Mastodon.  In an interview with The Verge, the head of Meta’s Instagram, Adam Mosseri, spoke of the benefits of open social networks for creators, calling out the ability to “own your audience” and that if someone wanted to leave Threads, they could take that audience (and content) with them.  The other benefit is allowing the content within social networks to leave their walled garden – right now to view content on Facebook, Instagram and, most recently, Twitter, you need an account to even see the posts, let alone share them. Federated systems allow any compatible system to view content from one another – just the way you can see a website on any browser from Chrome to Edge to Brave or read an email from Gmail in your Yahoo or Microsoft outlook account.  Will supporting ActivityPub mean Threads is decentralized?  While ActivityPub is a decentralized, open social networking protocol, Threads itself is an app created and controlled by Meta. As CoinDesk’s David Z. Morris notes, “decentralization on the back-end doesn’t seem like it’s going to stop Meta from doing its very favorite thing: gathering data about users of the front-end Threads app.”  So while ActivityPub Protocol is a decentralized protocol, Threads is an app or interface built separately and controlled by a centralized company, Meta, and while you may be able to take your audience with you, Meta is also still going to be gathering and using your data every time you use Threads.  When will Threads integrate ActivityPub?

The discount to NAV had ballooned to nearly 50% late last year and spent most of 2023 in a range on either side of 40%, but began a steep narrowing trend following BlackRock’s mid-June filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It fell to as low as 26% at one point last week – the trimmest level since May 2022 – and currently sits at about 27%, according to data from Ycharts.  BlackRock’s move for a spot bitcoin (BTC) ETF set off a number of filings and re-filings for similar funds from a number of other industry actors, including from fellow asset management giant Fidelity. The moves by such powerful players have raised investor hopes that the SEC will finally approve a spot bitcoin ETF after years of rejections.  That, in turn, has fueled buying in the heavily discounted GBTC, which Grayscale nearly two years ago filed to convert to a spot bitcoin ETF. The Grayscale filing was among those SEC rejections, prompting the company to sue the agency, with a decision expected by the end of quarter three.  Lawyers for the Grayscale on Monday added to their case, with a court filing noting the SEC in late June approved a leveraged bitcoin futures-based ETF, an ""even riskier"" product than previously approved bitcoin futures ETFs.  While optimism for SEC approval of a spot bitcoin ETF is running high at the moment, continued investor caution could be warranted. ""I had a really good laugh when we saw the BlackRock [spot bitcoin ETF] filing come out,"" said Opimas CEO and founder Octavio Marenzi, appearing on CoinDesk TV Monday morning.

Related Reading: XRP FUD Spikes, Will This Trigger A Price Reversal? Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Is Near “Overpriced” Territory An analyst in a CryptoQuant post pointed out that the BTC NVT Golden Cross has recently increased. The “Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the market cap of Bitcoin and its transaction volume. The “transaction volume” here naturally refers to the total amount of the asset that investors are moving around on the blockchain. The NVT ratio can be viewed as a comparison between the asset’s value (the market cap) and the blockchain’s ability to transact coins. When the indicator is high, the market cap is higher than the cryptocurrency’s volume. Such a trend can indicate that the asset’s price is currently overvalued. On the other hand, low values imply the market cap is low relative to the network’s ability to move tokens, so the asset’s spot price may be undervalued currently. The indicator of interest here is not the NVT itself but a modified form called the “NVT Golden Cross.” This metric compares the long-term moving average (30-day) of the NVT with the short-term one (10-day). Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross over the past year or so: The value of the metric seems to have been going up in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant In the above graph, the quant has marked the historical undervalued and overvalued zones for the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross. It looks like above a value of 2.2, the asset may be considered overpriced, as the cryptocurrency’s price has generally taken a hit when the indicator has entered into this territory. Similarly, the underpriced condition is defined at values under -1.6, with the cryptocurrency usually finding bottoms whenever the metric has dipped inside this zone. The chart shows that the NVT Golden Cross has been rising in the last few weeks as the latest leg in the BTC rally has taken place. Earlier in the month, the metric almost touched the overpriced zone, but it declined before fully entering it, as the asset price dropped from above the $31,000 level. Though the Bitcoin drawdown has been small, the indicator still has a relatively high value as it continues to be at a hand’s reach from the overvalued territory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Continue Exchange Inflows, But Price Holds On It remains to be seen whether the metric will go up again in the coming days and break into the overvalued territory (in which case, the price might observe a top formation) or if it will see further decline.

14736577,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/wasnt-crypto-supposed-to-be-for-retail-investors,1689008263,Wasn’t crypto supposed to be for retail investors?,"As retail investors leave crypto in droves, is institutional money coming in to quietly buy the cream of the cryptocurrencies? Sell and perhaps get in lower? Bitcoin is at a critical juncture. A narrative going around social media platforms such as Twitter suggests that with the backdrop of the SEC enforcement actions against Coinbase and Binance, the liquidity and investor interest that would normally propel the next bitcoin bull market just isn’t there. Bitcoin is going sideways and downwards, and certain influencers and analysts believe that the latest rejection from the $31,000 price level is the start of a fairly large pullback that could be in the range of 30% for bitcoin and up to 50% for the altcoins. In this sort of very uncertain environment weak hands are going to sell and even stronger hands might be thinking to do the same thing with a view to improving their position a lot lower down. Fickle retail money vs institutional know-how So we perhaps have the perfect scenario for an institutional take over of cryptocurrencies that have been in the hands of retail investors ever since they came onto the scene. It must be wondered though just how fickle retail is. It is hardly any time at all since Larry Fink, CEO of Blackrock, the largest asset management firm in the world, said on national TV in the US that bitcoin was an “international asset” and “digitised gold”. Obviously, it’s not at all sure that the Blackrock filing for a Spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved, especially given Gensler and the SEC’s extremely negative stance on crypto. Be that as it may, Blackrock isn’t just any company. It is a behemoth, and has untold influence in Washington and across the world. It will surely get the business done at some point. A Washington Post article published on Saturday posits that the “tech-focused investors” have moved on from crypto and are now much more interested in artificial intelligence, and that the once crazy amounts of venture capital that used to be thrown at crypto has “slowed to a trickle”. When this kind of narrative becomes this strong, and the bitcoin halving only 280 days away, it’s a perfect time for big money to slowly start coming into the crypto space. It cannot be argued that crypto will provide the solutions for many issues, especially in finance, and therefore now could be a good time for entry. The narrative is established When Satoshi Nakamoto launched bitcoin in the time of the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, he meant for bitcoin to be bought by the people in order to save them from the next, probably even worse crisis. The average retail investor is scared though. Mainstream media has done its work, and so has the Biden administration, central banks across the world, and regulatory agencies such as the SEC. As this next financial crisis looms larger, retail needs to be brave and hang on in there. The alternative can be so much worse. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Prometheum ""may have provided false testimony to Congress or violated U.S. securities laws,"" the open letter began. The lawmaker said Prometheum CEO Aaron Kaplan told Congress that it developed its own blockchain platform independently starting in December 2019. However, in SEC filings filed through 2021, Prometheum said it depended on Shanghai Wanxiang Blockchain, Inc., a Chinese firm Tuberville alleged had ties to the Chinese Communist Party.  ""If Prometheum began developing its own technology platform totally independent of its China-based, CCP-tied partners in December 2019 as Mr. Kaplan attempted to lead Congress to believe in his congressional testimony, why was this not made clear in Prometheum's SEC filings?"" the letter said. ""Why would Prometheum continue to assert in SEC filings through 2020 and well into 2021 that it was continuing development efforts with its partners Wanxiang and [Wanxiang subsidiary] Hashkey?""  In a statement shared with CoinDesk, a Prometheum spokesperson denied the senator's allegations, saying the company ""did not misrepresent"" its relationship with Wanxiang and saying the company's work would ""not be derailed by partisan and specious allegations.""  ""During testimony, Aaron Kaplan, Co-CEO and Co-Founder of Prometheum, never stated that the joint development of its blockchain trading system with Wanxiang ended in December 2019,"" the statement said. ""We determined in early 2020 the co-development of technology was not viable and in order to avoid corporate and litigation risk, sought to create value from our relationship. In its written testimony, Prometheum clearly states that joint development with Wanxiang and its affiliates formally ended in October 2021.""  Read more: The Crypto Industry’s New Favorite Punching Bag – Prometheum – Asks for a Chance  It's not the first time Tuberville has made these allegations. The lawmaker previously wrote an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal alleging that Prometheum's ties to Wanxiang and its broker approval ""could present threats to the data security and privacy of American investors.""  Kaplan has previously said that while Wanxiang has a 20% stake in Prometheum, it has no access to the firm's data and technology, and that the SEC has investigated this relationship.

42410217,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcVDXg,1689006035,"An Orb, a Token and Money for Everyone: Worldcoin’s CEO on Crypto’s Most Daring Project","Some Web3 projects are trying to create a better cryptocurrency. Some are tackling the problem of self-sovereign identity. Some are trying to tell the difference between what’s real and what’s an AI-created fake. Some are building systems for better governance. Some are trying to improve the development of AI through the principles of decentralization. Some are trying to reduce global inequalities.  Worldcoin is trying to do all of the above.  The goal is simple and modest: To create a system that will, eventually, freely distribute tokens to all eight billion people on the planet, as a form of universal basic income (UBI). But because the rise of AI will make it tricky to figure out who is human and who’s a digital fake, Worldcoin first needs to create a system that lets people -- all people, across the globe -- prove that they are in fact human beings.  To do this, they invented a physical device called “The Orb” that can scan your eyeball. The goal is for The Orb to eventually scan every eyeball of every human who walks the Earth. And at some point, if all goes well, everyone will have access to open-source and decentralized financial tools.  If Worldcoin was the brainchild of some random crypto bro, maybe it could be laughed away as a delusion of grandeur. But the project has real intellectual heft. It was co-founded by Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI (creator of ChatGPT), who’s arguably the most central player in the development of AI. Altman suspects that the world will change forever if -- or when -- AI becomes so advanced that it achieves AGI, or Artificial General Intelligence, meaning it truly surpasses the abilities of humans.  Perhaps that world is a terrifying dystopia that wipes out the species, Skynet-style. But it’s also possible that AGI unlocks wondrous leaps of productivity, which could confer financial benefits to the world. As Marc Andreessen recently argued in an uber-bullish essay on AI, “Productivity growth throughout the economy will accelerate dramatically, driving economic growth, creation of new industries, creation of new jobs, and wage growth, and resulting in a new era of heightened material prosperity across the planet.”  If AGI is doing all the work, maybe we humans could enjoy lives of leisure, spending our time writing poetry or singing songs or -- more likely -- arguing on social media. And if AGI really does somehow benefit society in a meaningful way, how do we equitably spread the bounty to the masses? Enter UBI (a popular idea in Silicon Valley for coping with a world of automation). Enter Worldcoin.  You can argue that this is not only the most ambitious startup in crypto, but one of the most audacious projects in all of history. It feels like a dorm-room hypothetical. “It sounded absolutely ridiculous,” admits Alex Blania, who first heard the idea in 2019, when he was then a 25-year-old genius studying theoretical physics. Altman had emailed Blania to suss out his interest in joining the project. “I honestly didn't take it seriously for quite a while,” says Blania. But he drove to San Francisco for an interview; he’s now the co-founder and CEO of Tools for Humanity, Worldcoin's parent company.  For the first year of Worldcoin’s existence, Blania and his team focused on research. They built prototypes. In 2021, they announced The Orb. Then they deployed it in the field. The project now claims to have 1.8 million signups; the ultimate goal is 8 billion. (Full disclosure: CoinDesk’s David Z. Morris finds this prospect truly alarming.)  And if this happens? If they actually pull off this wild plan, giving everyone on the planet access to self-sovereign identity and universal basic income? When I ask him that during our recent Zoom interview, Blania is almost at a loss for words, thinking that this moment would represent “one of the most profound technological shifts that has ever happened.”  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  What was your reaction when Sam pitched you the idea for Worldcoin?  Alex Blania: I honestly didn't take it seriously for quite a while. That’s my honest answer. I think Max [Novendstern, another co-founder] and Sam wrote a two or three-page document that described a couple of ideas. That’s the stage it was at.  What was the gist of that document?  The streams of thought were that, one, AGI is going to happen. It’s going to disrupt society in a meaningful way. And Sam already had the conviction that UBI will eventually need to happen, and it might be one of the most important things for society.  Two, Sam is actually a big believer in crypto as a whole, just very skeptical about many of the things that happened last year in the industry. And one thing he has seen is that people always underestimate the importance of network effects, and how wild and profound they are once they play out. So many of the things we need [such as cryptocurrency] are already there, and we just need to scale it to many, many more people to actually get adoption going.  Sounds so simple!  So simple, right? And then the last paragraph was around, what if we could just launch a token to everyone? [Editor’s note: Due to regulatory concerns, Worldcoin tokens are not currently planned for the United States.] Just for being a human being, and align incentives to grow the network really, really quickly. And as a result, we would bootstrap a non-government and truly open identity and financial network.  And it sounded absolutely ridiculous. But back then I thought, well, [if this fails] I can always go back and get another job, so why don't I actually try it?  How would you describe the goal of Worldcoin?  The goal of Worldcoin is to launch a currency by giving ownership to every human being. And as a result, give them world ID and give them access to decentralized financial tools.  I honestly didn't take it seriously for quite a while  How does it work?  So when you sign up as a user, right now, you basically download an app that’s called World App, which is a non-custodial wallet. You download the app. You show up in front of a physical device, and that physical device basically issues you your World ID, which is a kind of a digital identity that you can use to anonymously verify the different services.  Once you’ve done that, [in the future] you receive ownership in the actual token every week by just being part of it. These are the three things. So World ID, World App, and Worldcoin. [Editor’s note: Worldcoin later reiterated that the token is not currently planned for the United States, due to regulatory concerns.]  Why is proving identity so central to all of this?  The problem is very simple. The problem is you need to make sure that every human being can get a unique identity that’s completely privacy-preserving. That's the task. And government identities simply do not work for that, because they might work well in the United States, they might work well in Europe, but much of the world does not have an actual verifiable digital identity.  Right, and that brings us to The Orb. You mentioned that a user needs to show up, in person, at a physical device, for an eyeball scan. Why is this necessary?  At first, we really did not want to solve identity, because the idea itself was so ambitious. But we realized that there's just no way around it. So when we think of proving identity, there are three big concepts, in terms of how you do it: You have a web of trust, you have of course government KYC [such as passports], and then you can use all kinds of different biometrics.  And we built prototypes for all three of these areas. That’s what we did the first year.  You guys went with biometric. Why?  Many of the systems that are live today will get quite challenged in a world of [improving AI]. It’s going to be very easy to fake things on the internet. Asking someone to do certain tasks, like CAPTCHA, or a more complicated form of CAPTCHA, will eventually break. You fundamentally need to bridge to the physical world, and measure what it means to be a human. And that’s why The Orb.  The Orb has been, ah, to put it lightly, “polarizing,” especially on crypto Twitter.  I think it’s one of the biggest discussion points about the project. On the one hand, some people in crypto just hate it, and are like, “Oh my God, this is so terrible, how can you call it The Orb?” But on the other hand, everyone talks about it, and it somehow sticks, right?  You’re at least giving Twitter great content! So thank you for that.  Sam's favorite quote about Worldcoin, which he gave me in the first meeting, was that the biggest risk of Worldcoin is that no one cares.  People care! And people, of course, are worried about what The Orb means for surveillance and privacy. How do you respond to these concerns?  So my high-level response is that something like World ID will eventually exist, meaning that you will need to verify [that you are human] on the internet, whether you like it or not. I think that's certainly going to happen with the progress in AI. It’s probably going to happen in the next couple of years.  And Worldcoin, I think, is the only path that we currently have that can get to that level of being accepted by the powerful players, and still be completely privacy-preserving and not rely on government infrastructure. And it’s all open source -- all of those things that crypto theoretically loves.  Why couldn’t something like facial recognition work, like we have with the iPhone?  With FaceID on the iPhone, that’s just verifying that it’s you showing up again. It’s proving the same person is using the phone. That’s a pretty easy task to solve, because it’s very hard for me to look exactly like you. It’s a one-to-one comparison.  But with Worldcoin, you have the opposite problem. When one user signs up to Worldcoin, you need to compare that one user against everyone else that has already signed up. So the task becomes not, “Do I look exactly like you,” but rather “Do I look like a new human being in the network?” Mathematically, you need much more information about each human being to solve that problem. And if you don’t have information about each user, then you will not be able to make those comparisons after tens of millions of people signed up. You just hit a wall.  So if you want to solve this Proof of Personhood problem -- this unique human being amongst a billion people problem -- with just a face camera or a Face ID or something like that, you would fail after tens of millions of signups. The iris is very unique. It’s very hard to fake. It’s pretty stable over time. It has many properties that make it the best way to solve the problem.  [Note: At this point on the Zoom call, Rebecca Hahn, the Chief Communications Officer for Tools for Humanity (Worldcoin’s parent company) jumps in to clarify what The Orb is *not* collecting.]  Rebecca Hahn: What’s happening is that The Orb captures images of your iris, and then creates a code that’s a unique identifier. The identifier says that you’re human and that you’re unique. Not that you’re Rebecca or Jeff or male or female or any other characteristic. It’s really those two points, human and unique.  You currently have 1.8 million signups. Given what you just said The Orb captures, does this mean you don’t know anything about these signups except that they’re unique and human? You don’t know that 30% are from Europe, or 55% are male, and so on?  Alex Blania: We can count which Orbs [in different locations] did how many signups, and things like that. So there’s kind of metadata from the actual signup process. But the most important piece is that you show up in front of The Orb, and the first thing it does is it actually verifies that you're an actual human being.  There are many sensors. There’s a thermal camera. There’s a 3D time-of-flight camera. These are checking that you are not a display, but an actual human being. And then the imaging happens and an iris code is calculated, as Rebecca just alluded to.  It gets signed by The Orb, and then a uniqueness check happens in the cloud. And this is the cool part -- the uniqueness check is separated from the user knowledge proofs. Basically, the user just proves that they’re included in that set of unique other users without actually releasing their information or the key or anything, right?  You end up in a situation where you have a pseudonymous unique identifier that you can use across different platforms. And you don't even have a global identifier, by the way. It’s all with the user. So you, a user, can decide how much you want to share with different platforms.  Rebecca Hahn: So part of the conversation is that maybe years from now, there’s this world where there’s a distribution of the financial upside from AI. But then today, right now, as basic as it seems, there’s a world where you can incorporate World ID into Twitter and then it solves a lot of problems.  You haven’t used these words, but you’re essentially trying to solve Self-Sovereign ID, or SSID. Is that right?  It's a much deeper shift than just the social network, than Facebook  Alex Blania: Yes.  Again, simple! To wrap up, let’s imagine a future where you’ve succeeded. You’ve succeeded perfectly in everything you’re trying to build. You’ve done it. You’ve cracked the code. World ID and Worldcoin is everywhere. Universal basic income is distributed to everyone on the planet. What does that world look like?  [Pause.]  [Longer pause.]  Alex Blania: I mean, honestly, I think going that far and making predictions is super, super hard, right? Because as soon as we cross, say, three billion signups, that is probably one of the most profound technological shifts that has ever happened.  Because it's a much deeper shift than just the social network, than Facebook. You have a network that has identity, and it has fundamental money primitives in it. It's a profound shift. So making predictions… I think is pretty hard.  But I will talk about a couple of things that excite me, and I think can happen.  Sure, I’ll take it.  Alex Blania: So, starting with crypto. I was early into crypto; I read the Bitcoin whitepaper a couple of weeks after it came out. [Editor’s note: In 2008, Blania would have been around 14 years old.] This was super inspiring. This idea that you had a decentralized financial network.  Back then the idea was around peer-to-peer cash. Now we just say it's a store-of-value, but back then the idea was different.  So I think one thing that is truly exciting about what can happen with Worldcoin is that, if you go that far [in the future], is that one of the things that will happen is you’ll see actual peer-to-peer usage. And it might not even be Worldcoin, right?  It’s just that these users actually end up with public and private keys and then identity. So they will just start using crypto in their daily life. Similar to how Tesla accelerated the transition to electric cars, I think Worldcoin will accelerate the transition to all of those products quite drastically.  I think that itself is inspiring. It’s exciting. And I do think whatever will happen around [AI development] and Worldcoin will get pretty cool. Meaning, hopefully, Worldcoin users will actually have influence over the development of some of the largest [AI] systems that get deployed in the world.  And if we get to 8 billion users, you will certainly log in and you will actually just get UBI through your World ID.  All of this is so profound I cannot even… What do you think will happen?  You’re the expert! I’m just along for the ride. But I can’t wait to find out.

14735044,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542006,1689004832,US Presidential Candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr Called Out For Lying About Bitcoin Investment,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, has come forward to clarify that he does, in fact, hold a sizeable quantity of Bitcoin, despite his earlier denial of having a Bitcoin investment during a conference in Miami which took place just barely two months ago. While speaking to a crowd at the Miami Bitcoin conference held in May, Robert F. Kennedy Jr was asked if he was an investor in Bitcoin. The Democratic presidential candidate responded in the negative, saying he wasn’t going to give investment advice about the cryptocurrency, but he did add that he would be taking donations in BTC for his campaign. “I am not an investor and I am not here to give investment advice,” he said at the conference. Records Show Otherwise Financial records have shown otherwise and revealed that RFK Jr probably lied about his Bitcoin investment. A financial disclosure form that Kennedy submitted on June 30 indicates a brokerage account that held between $100,001 and $250,000 worth of Bitcoin as of the date that the submission was made. Related Reading: XRP FUD Spikes, Will This Trigger A Price Reversal? In the document, which does not specify when the transaction was made, it is stated that Kennedy’s family earned less than 201 dollars as a result of the purchase. When the news of the investment first broke out, Kennedy’s campaign manager tried to clarify the details of the investment, saying that the BTC purchase was made during the time period between the speech in Miami and the June 30 filing deadline. In a bit of a moment that looked like damage control, the investment was initially attributed to his wife. However, the campaign later said that they were mistaken and that the Bitcoin investment did indeed belong to Kennedy. BTC price holding steady above $30,300 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Support For Bitcoin Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency in the world, with investor interest steadily increasing. So it is not clear why Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made comments that are inconsistent with his investment in BTC, nor is it clear whether the investment was made before or after his presence at the Miami conference. One reason is if Kennedy were to promote Bitcoin while on the campaign trail while his immediate family possessed the cryptocurrency, the situation may be considered a conflict of interest. However, his campaign office, on the other hand, has denied any conflict. “There is no conflict here,” campaign manager Kucinich told CNBC. Interestingly, the presidential candidate has been a vocal supporter of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in the past, saying, “Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin give the public an escape route” from a financial crisis. And his campaign is one of the few accepting donations in BTC. Related Reading: Arkham’s New Crypto Intel Trading Platform: A Game Changer For Traders?

14735310,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/standard-chartered-projects-bitcoin-btc-to-reach-120k-by-2024,1689004800,Standard Chartered Projects Bitcoin $BTC To Reach $120K by 2024,"In its latest research report, Standard Chartered Bank has presented an optimistic forecast for Bitcoin, suggesting that the leading cryptocurrency could touch the $50,000 milestone by the end of 2021, and climb to an impressive $120,000 by 2024's close. Mining Economics Fueling Bitcoin's Potential Ascend Driving this prediction is a key factor: the growing profitability of Bitcoin miners. As Geoff Kendrick, the head of FX and digital assets research at Standard Chartered, explained in the report, miners play a vital role in determining the net supply of the newly minted cryptocurrency, on top of their responsibility of maintaining the Bitcoin ledger. ""Increased miner profitability per BTC (bitcoin) mined means they can sell less while maintaining cash inflows, reducing net BTC supply and pushing BTC prices higher,"" Kendrick stated. According to Standard Chartered's report, the primary driving force behind its predicted Bitcoin price surge involves Bitcoin miners. These miners create approximately 900 new Bitcoins globally every day. The costs they incur, predominantly power expenses for high-performance computers, are currently being offset by selling 100% of these freshly minted coins, as per the bank's estimation. However, should Bitcoin's value climb to $50,000, Standard Chartered believes miners would only need to sell between 20% and 30% of their new coins to cover their costs. This reduction in the number of new coins entering the market could potentially limit the available supply, thereby driving prices up. A surge in miner profitability per Bitcoin mined means miners are under less pressure to sell their output. This shift allows miners to retain their earnings while simultaneously decreasing the net Bitcoin supply, creating a favorable environment for Bitcoin prices to rise. Forecast Revision, Shifting Market Conditions This recent revision is a significant upgrade from the bank's previous forecast in April, which projected Bitcoin hitting $100,000. According to Standard Chartered, this initial prediction, influenced by several factors including a banking-sector crisis, now appears ""too conservative."" Since then, the market conditions have shifted notably. Bitcoin has experienced an 80% increase from the start of 2021 and is currently trading around $30,100, triggering the bank's reconsideration of its initial forecast. In light of the revised projection, it's clear that financial institutions are adapting their strategies and outlooks in response to the highly dynamic cryptocurrency market, underscored by the recent flurry of institutional interest and significant price movements. As the sector continues to transform, these expert forecasts offer valuable insights into potential trends and fluctuations. However, investors and market observers should approach these predictions with a keen awareness of the broader context — the cryptocurrency market's intrinsic volatility and unpredictability. At the time of writing, the current trading price of Bitcoin, at around $30,200, represents an 80% increase since the start of 2021, which is an important consideration when gauging the potential future trajectory of this premier cryptocurrency.

42410222,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcVDoD,1689003306,"CoinDesk Market Index Q2 Review: Quiet Appreciation, Regulatory Uncertainty","It’s been a bit of a choppy ride for the cryptocurrency market this past quarter, coming off a strong first quarter. Over the past three months, the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which spans over 90% of the crypto market capitalization, appreciated 2.2%, while both bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) outperformed the broad benchmark, posted a gain of 7%, and 5.2%, respectively.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) is a broad-based index designed to measure the market capitalization weighted performance of the digital asset market subject to minimum trading and exchange eligibility requirements.  This underperformance in the CMI, relative to BTC and ETH can be largely attributed to the quarter which saw significant regulatory action against large cap alternative tokens, combined with positive developments for Bitcoin, resulting in a bifurcation in the crypto market between bitcoin and ether versus all other digital assets.  Sector by sector  Within the sector framework of the CoinDesk DACS, we continued to see evidence of this separation by market capitalization over the quarter, with sectors containing bitcoin and ether [Currency (CCY, +6%) and Smart Contract Platform (SMT, -2.4%), respectively] outperforming small capitalization sectors such as Digitization (DTZ, -28%) and Culture and Entertainment (CNE, -35%).  Both April and May were relatively muted months as the market traded within a price range established after the response to the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in March. The range-bound market also exhibited lower than average realized volatility, with Q2 2023 exhibiting the lowest volatility quarter for CMI, Bitcoin (XBX) and Ether (ETH) in the past 2 years (see Figure 2 for average volatility by quarter, estimated using hourly return data).  While AI themes were playing out within traditional equity markets, digital asset traders were focused on newly-minted meme tokens, such as PEPE and BRC-20 ordinal tokens which drove on-chain activity to the benefit of staking node validators and miners.  In May, we began to see some slight weakness across the asset class due to the macro headwinds of rising interest rate expectations, as market expectations for interest rates repriced higher and for longer, as the U.S. 2-year yield increased ~30bps and the U.S. treasury yield curve eliminated rate cuts expectations for the rest of the year.  The range-bound market persisted into June, where the lows of the range were first tested by the Binance and Coinbase SEC announcements, then later the highs with the announcement of the BlackRock filing of a Bitcoin spot ETF. This latter event focused attention and demand for bitcoin, which had positive knock-on effects for both the Currency Sector and broad CMI cap weighted index.  This Bitcoin positive development, combined with the SEC action against Coinbase for allegedly listing specific alt coins as unregistered securities, resulted in an increase in the ratio of Bitcoin Market Cap to Total Crypto Market Cap (“Bitcoin Dominance”, see Figure 3) to accelerate above 50% to levels not seen since 2021 and a dramatic underperformance of small cap vs large cap crypto tokens.  Where we go from here: outlook  Monthly crypto exchange trading volume (see Figure 4) and Google Search Trend data (see Figure 5) have not recovered to 2020-2021 levels, which suggests that retail interest in crypto continues to stagnate due to the lower token price levels relative to the 2021 bull market period. This reduced interest is supported by the lower levels of realized volatility across bitcoin (XBX), ether (ETX) and the broad CMI index, as markets that move less are less attractive to traders.  With the recent flurry of Bitcoin Spot ETF filings, and newer institutional exchange offerings (such as EDX), we can hope that this interest gets revitalized by new institutional entrants into the market, which will bring new focus and attention to the asset class, as well as more consistent trading activities and volumes.  Within our suite of CoinDesk Indices indicators, both Bitcoin and Ethereum Trend Indicators are currently estimating strong upward trends and are suggestive of a move towards higher prices from current levels, while the macro-economic environment is more neutral over the near term, as positive U.S. credit conditions are offset by recent moves higher in nominal and real interest rates.  These net positive nearer term indicators should also be weighed against a substantially inverted US yield curve (see Figure 6 below), which is the most inverted since the early 1980s. An inverted yield curve has historically preceded most U.S. recession by 6-18 months, with the current inverted condition beginning in July of 2022.  While this is not a perfect recession indicator, it does suggest a likely recession within the next 6-12 months, which would likely impact market risk sentiment and investor demand for cryptocurrency and digital assets. For this reason, we continue to suggest utilizing the Bitcoin and Ethereum Trend Indicators signals to lean into positively trending markets and reduce risk during choppy and downward trending markets.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Todd Groth,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/07/10/coindesk-market-index-q2-review-quiet-appreciation-regulatory-uncertainty,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6243807ca8294c056af090c7143da3838c9c2bc3-2188x952.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This new platform will connect buyers and sellers of information on any crypto wallet address securely and anonymously via smart contract technology. Arkham’s Anonymous On-Chain Intel Exchange The Arkham Intel Exchange is designed to meet the growing demand for on-chain analysis from traders, investors, journalists, researchers, and protocols. The platform also aims to provide a way for talented on-chain sleuths to monetize their skills and experience, creating a decentralized intel-to-earn economy. According to the announcement, buyers on the Arkham Intel Exchange can request and purchase information related to any on-chain activity, not just limited to entity labels. For example, victims of an exploit may pool resources to acquire Intel on the exploiter, while a trading firm may wish to buy out intel on their wallet before a competitor finds it. Any information related to a crypto wallet address, such as transaction history, balances, and other on-chain activities, can be bought and sold on the Intel Exchange. Related Reading: XRP FUD Spikes, Will This Trigger A Price Reversal? The platform aims to provide a liquid market for information, allowing on-chain sleuths to monetize their work at scale and meet the growing demand for on-chain intel in a scalable way. But how does the bounty system work? The bounty system on the Arkham Intel Exchange is designed to connect buyers who need information on a crypto wallet address with bounty hunters who have the required intel. Buyers can post bounties by setting a reward for the information they need, and the reward can be in any cryptocurrency supported by the platform. Once a bounty is posted, bounty hunters can claim it by submitting the requested intel. The bounty hunter who submits the required intel first is eligible to claim the reward set by the buyer. To prevent spam, all bounty hunters must stake a small amount, which will be slashed in the event their submissions are not approved. Additionally, any intel bought or sold on the Intel Exchange will be exclusively held by the acquirer for 90 days. After that, the information will be propagated to all users, ensuring the decentralization of on-chain knowledge to the community over the long run. After the 90-day holding period is over, the information is added to the Arkham platform and granted to Arkham’s wider community. This ensures the decentralization of on-chain knowledge to the community over the long run. The Arkham Intel Exchange will be live on Tuesday, July 18, and all transactions on the platform will take place through smart contracts audited by Arkham’s partner, Quantstamp. Arkham Token Sale Goes Live On Binance Launchpad Binance Launchpad, the token launch platform of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, has announced its partnership with Arkham for the public token sale of its native token ARKM. This marks the 32nd project to feature a token sale on Binance Launchpad. The ARKM token sale will follow the Launchpad subscription format, which will record user Binance Coin (BNB) balances for six days starting from July 11th, 2023. The final BNB holding amount for each user will be determined as the average of the six days, using the Daily Average BNB Balance calculation previously announced by Binance. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Price Hits Key Resistance, What’s Next? The ARKM token sale is set to have a hard cap of $2.5 million, with a hard cap per user of $15,000 (or 300,000 ARKM).

The public sale token price for ARKM is $0.05 per token, with the price in BNB to be determined before subscription. The subscription timeline is set to take place from July 17th to July 18th, with the subscription period opening for all eligible users for a 24-hour period.

The British multinational bank increased its bitcoin price forecast from the $100,000 predicted in April. Standard Chartered said at the time that bitcoin had the potential to reach that level because of several factors, one of them being the banking-sector crisis.  ""We now think this estimate is too conservative, and we therefore see upside to our end-2024 target,"" the report said.  Bitcoin has climbed 80% since the start of the year and is currently trading around $30,100.  The report cites increased bitcoin miner profitability as one of the factors that will drive the price this time.  “The rationale here is that as well as maintaining the bitcoin ledger, miners play a key role in determining net supply of newly mined BTC,” wrote Geoff Kendrick, head of FX and digital assets research.  Increased miner profitability per bitcoin mined means miners can sell less of their output while maintaining cash inflows, reducing net bitcoin supply and thus pushing the prices higher, according to the report.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/10/bitcoin-could-rise-to-120k-by-end-2024-standard-chartered,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9671b1d7488457d9192370d402ecbdd3c3ea9589-4452x2504.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) slipped 0.2% to $30.2K at 9:58 a.m. ET, but still up 17.2% M/M and 81.3% Y/Y. The banking giant had previously targeted an end-2024 bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) forecast of $100K , arguing that ""the much-touted ‘crypto winter’ is finally over.” The reason for a $20K bump in its price target is ""increased miner profitability per BTC (bitcoin) mined means they can sell less while maintaining cash inflows, reducing net BTC supply and pushing BTC prices higher,"" StanChart FX analyst Geoff Kendrick wrote, Reuters reported. By comparison, Seeking Alpha analysts appear far more conservative with their BTC price forecasts, in the wake of heightened regulatory scrutiny, among other headwinds. Clem Chambers , for instance, reckons BTC can hit as low as $13K by the end of 2023, “but the most likely answer is $25,000. The way Bitcoin is riding out the regulatory disaster zone, almost any price sub-$100,000 is possible, but I remain a bear sitting out this crazy dance.” More on bitcoin and miners: Crypto Roundtable: Top Picks For 2023, Bitcoin's Price At Year-End, The Halving's Impact, And More Don't Rely On Bitcoin Dominance Riot Platforms: Massive Bitcoin Mining Expansion Keeps Us Bullish",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3986472-bitcoin-to-surge-to-120k-by-end-2024-stanchart-reportedly-predicts?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14731787.jpeg

Potential for price appreciation: The price of LFi tokens has the potential to go up in the coming years. This means that users who mint LFi tokens now could potentially see their portfolio grow in value. Understanding Minting Crypto minting is the process of creating new units of a cryptocurrency without the need for computational work. It is an important part of the process by which new cryptocurrency units are created and added to the market. There are a variety of different mechanisms through which crypto minting can occur, depending on the specific cryptocurrency being minted. In some cases, crypto minting can occur through a process called staking. Staking involves holding a certain amount of a cryptocurrency in a wallet or on a particular blockchain network. Stakers are then rewarded with newly minted units of the cryptocurrency, based on the amount they hold and the length of time they have held it. Here are some of the most common mechanisms to generate crypto units: Proof-of-work (PoW): PoW is the most common mechanism for crypto mining. It involves using powerful computers to solve complex mathematical problems in order to verify transactions and add them to the blockchain. The first miner to solve a problem is rewarded with newly minted units of the cryptocurrency. Proof-of-stake (PoS): PoS is a more energy-efficient alternative to PoW. It involves locking up a certain amount of cryptocurrency in a wallet in order to become a validator. Validators are then randomly selected to verify transactions and add them to the blockchain. They are rewarded with newly minted units of the cryptocurrency for their services. Crypto minting is an important part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It allows for the creation of new units of cryptocurrency, which helps to keep the market liquid and growing. The different mechanisms for crypto minting offer a variety of options for users, depending on their preferences and resources.

42410221,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcVDhb,1688994829,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Holding Above $30K After Quiet Weekend,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) were little-changed on Monday, but a number of crypto gainers from last week were pulling back. In macro news to come this week, investors will be focusing on U.S. inflation figures on Wednesday for signals regarding the Federal Reserve’s next move. Since breaking above $30,000 in June, bitcoin has traded between $29,500 and $31,500. “These levels could be important in the near-term,” said SEBA Bank in a morning note. “With U.S. CPI expected this week, a break of either level could see a trend emerge.” Among those cryptos giving back some of last week’s gains were Avalanche’s AVAX, down 5% over the past 24 hours, and Solana’s SOL, which dipped 4% over the same time frame.  Coinbase (COIN) acknowledged the possibility that federal securities laws would apply to its listings years ago, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) argued in a new filing Friday. The agency was responding to a Coinbase filing which claimed the SEC does not have sufficient jurisdiction to bring a lawsuit against it. The SEC sued Coinbase a month ago, alleging it was operating as an unregistered broker, clearinghouse and exchange, having listed at least 13 different cryptocurrencies that are unregistered securities. In Friday's court filing, the SEC said that it would oppose any motion for judgment Coinbase might submit, and asked a court to strike the exchange’s arguments that the suit violated the major questions doctrine and other concerns. ""Coinbase, a multi-billion-dollar entity advised by sophisticated legal counsel, argues it was unaware that its conduct risked violating the federal securities laws, and suggests that by approving Coinbase’s registration statement in 2021 the SEC confirmed the legality of Coinbase’s underlying business activities – at that time and for all time,"" the SEC said in its filing.  Around 15 retail central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could be in circulation across the world by the end of this decade, according to a survey carried out by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). A Switzerland-based body owned by 63 central banks representing around 95% of the world economy, the BIS said nine central banks had also indicated they're “very likely” to issue a CBDC for wholesale use in financial markets within the next six years. Of the 86 central banks surveyed by BIS, 93% are now undertaking CBDC work, the study said, with major jurisdictions such as India, the U.K. and the European Union all seriously exploring issuing a digital version of their fiat currencies.  Chart of the Day  The number of bitcoin held in wallets tied to cryptocurrency exchange Huobi has dropped below 20,000 BTC, the lowest since 2017.  The balance has declined to levels which become increasingly critical to maintain on-exchange liquidity, according to Deutsche Digital Assets.  ""Huobi's stablecoin reserves in Tether (USDT) also appear relatively low. This could become a source of further uncertainty for crypto markets down the road if Huobi experienced further outflows,"" analysts at Deutsche Digital Assets said in a weekly report.

14730200,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541942,1688994009,"XRP FUD Spikes, Will This Trigger A Price Reversal?","Data shows FUD related to XRP may be spreading on social media platforms right now, a sign that could potentially help the price reverse. XRP Social Dominance Has Spiked While The Price Has Been Declining According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, discussions around XRP have surged during the past day. The relevant indicator here is the “social volume,” which measures the total amount of unique social media text documents that are making mentions of a given cryptocurrency. The social media text documents here refer to a collection of posts, threads, and other forms of text-based data sourced from major platforms like Twitter, Reddit, Telegram, and 4chan. Since the metric only counts the “unique” number of such documents, it means that individual posts have the same weightage, regardless of how many times they mention the term (obviously, they will only be counted at all if they have at least one mention). This restriction has the benefit that a few posts with a large number of mentions of the asset can’t skew the social volume on their own. Thus, the indicator can provide us hints about the degree of discussion that a coin is receiving from the average social media users. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Nosedive If It Continues To Struggle Below $31K Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the XRP social volume over the past month: The value of the metric seems to have been quite high in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the XRP social volume has registered some high values during the past day or so. This would suggest that discussions around the cryptocurrency have become elevated in this period. In the chart, data for another indicator, “social dominance,” is also shown. This metric tells us what percentage of the combined social volume of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (by market cap) is being contributed by any individual coin. From the graph, it’s visible that the XRP social dominance has also observed a large spike recently. Naturally, this trend would suggest that the relative share of discussions on social media platforms related to this asset has gone up. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Continue Exchange Inflows, But Price Holds On The implication here is that the latest social volume increase isn’t due to a general uplift in talks related to the cryptocurrency sector, but rather due to an increased interest in XRP specifically (if it was otherwise, the social dominance wouldn’t have changed too much even after the rise in the social volume). Since this high focus on the asset has come as the price has been declining, it would appear likely that these discussions are occurring due to the investors feeling fearful. Historically, markets have tended to move opposite to what the crowd is expecting, with the probability of such a reverse move going up as the investors assume a stronger opinion. So as a high amount of FUD is potentially going around among the XRP traders right now, the price may be able to benefit from this and experience a rebound. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $0.47, down 2% in the last week.

Arcadia Finance has reportedly been the victim of an exploit which allowed hackers to drain roughly $455,000. Decentralised finance (DeFi) platform Arcadia Finance has reportedly become the latest victim of a hack. Blockchain investigating firm PeckShields reported the exploit and said it was due to “the lack of untrusted input validation.” #PeckShieldAlert Our community contributor has detected that @ArcadiaFi has been exploited on both #Ethereum and #Optimism for ~$455KThe exploiter on #Ethereum was frontrun by 0x5C75e94dD0Ab9c10BFd1B8073DafEF031D3c050dhttps://t.co/blGx5IEAkkThe exploiter on #optimism… pic.twitter.com/WDzF0XVcmL — PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) July 10, 2023 PeckShields alerted about a code vulnerability that allowed a hacker to drain funds worth about $455,000 from Ethereum (darcWETH) and Optimism (darcUSDC) vaults. According to the firm, the code vulnerability lacked a validation mechanism to cross-check unverified inputs. It added, “There is a lack of reentrancy protection, which allows for the instant liquidation to bypass the internal vault health check.” PeckShields also reported the exploiter transferred roughly 179 ETH by bridging 148 ETH and swapping 59,000 USDC to crypto mixer Tornado Cash. Arcadia TVL Drops 76% Following the hack, DeFiLlama reported that Arcadia’s Total Value Locked (TVL) dropped by a staggering 76%, from $605,000 to $145,000. The exploit on Arcadia Finance comes only days after a $130 million hack on Multichain’s MPC bridge platform. Observers noted $102 million worth of crypto was withdrawn from the Multichain Fantom bridge on the Ethereum side. $666,000 worth of Dogecoin (DOGE) and $5 million from Moonriver were also removed. An additional 7214 Wrapped Ether tokens, 1024 Wrapped Bitcoin, and $58 million worth of USDC tokens were drained from the Fantom bridge’s Ethereum smart contract.

For the SHIB bulls, now is the time to show their true strength. To recall: earlier this year, SHIB experienced a furious rally of close to 100%. But since the yearly high on February 4, at $0.00001597, the Shiba Inu price has been in a descending trend channel, which has even pushed the price well below the yearly opening price at around $0.000008. Over the past weekend, the long-awaited breakout from the descending trend channel took place. The Shiba Inu price broke above the top of the trend channel at $0.0000076 and managed to hold firm above this level on Sunday. However, some selling pressure can be observed today (Monday). A retest of the breakout from the trend channel is taking place. Based on this, it is now up to the SHIB bulls to confirm the trend and avoid a fakeout. If this fails, investors could quickly lose interest in Shiba Inu again and the price could fall towards the mid-range of the trend channel and the yearly low at $0.000006. Related Reading: Significant Surge: Large Shiba Inu Token Transactions Capture Spotlight If the breakout is confirmed, however, resistance at $0.00000833 could become the first target. At this price level, the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level is also located. With the daily RSI currently sitting at 49, there is still much room left for an explosive move north which could send SHIB on a 30% rally towards the resistance area between $0.00000969 (200-day EMA) and $0.00000977 (38.2% Fibonacci retracement level), before the psychologically important level of $0.00001 is also within reach. At this point, a breather from a possible rally can be expected. Bullish Case For Shiba Inu Price Prevails Santiment, a renowned market intelligence platform, has highlighted the renewed interest in Shiba Inu, evident through a surge in whale transactions. Recent data reveals an astonishing 14 separate transfers exceeding $1 million each as of July 6, the highest level recorded since April 3 this year. Such significant movements of capital not only underscore the confidence of prominent investors but also serve as a testament to the growing trust and belief in the potential of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. A compelling factor contributing to the price rise of Shiba Inu also lies in the generation of new addresses within its network. As reported by Bitcoinist, Shiba Inu has witnessed a substantial increase in the creation of daily addresses, consistently surpassing 2,500 per day in recent weeks. The month of June alone witnessed a staggering surge, with daily new addresses exceeding 4,000, marking an incredible 400% rise from the quarterly low in May. The significance of this surge in new addresses cannot be underestimated. as it shows the renowned interest by retail investors. Related Reading: Breaking: Shiba Inu Lead Dev Reveals Shibarium Release Date, SHIB Up 3% Another factor amplifying Shiba Inu’s price upswing is the heightened anticipation of Shibarium. Enthusiasts and investors firmly believe that Shibarium’s launch will exert a substantial influence on the value of Shiba Inu’s ecosystem.

SEC Claps Back At Coinbase The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has finally responded to Coinbase’s claims that the former lacks the jurisdiction to regulate the crypto exchange’s activities. It all started on June 6, 2023, when the US regulatory body filed charges against Coinbase, claiming that the crypto exchange had offered investors unregistered securities since 2019. The “unregistered securities,” in this case, were several cryptocurrencies. In the SEC’s recent letter, the organization addressed a district judge and argued that Coinbase, as a ""multi-billion-dollar entity advised by sophisticated legal counsel,"" intentionally disregarded decades of established legal precedent, specifically the landmark Howey test, in an attempt to create its own criteria for determining what constitutes an investment contract. Coinbase Acknowledged Securities Law? The response from the SEC highlighted Coinbase's own acknowledgment of the risk that assets traded on its platform could be classified as securities. The regulator quoted from Coinbase's public statements since becoming a publicly traded company, emphasizing that the company had consistently informed shareholders about the potential violation of federal securities laws resulting from its conduct. The SEC also presented evidence that the crypto firm was well aware of the federal securities laws and how they could be applied to the exchange’s activities. The letter also claimed that the Coinbase team had even gone as far as communicating the potential securities laws violations and the associated risks to its shareholders. An excerpt from the letter reads. “Since becoming a public company, Coinbase has repeatedly informed its shareholders of the risk that the crypto assets traded on its platform could be deemed securities and therefore that its conduct could violate the federal securities laws.” Coinbase Claims Lack Of Jurisdiction This letter from the SEC is in direct response to a previous filing made by Coinbase on June 28, where the latter appealed to the court to dismiss the case on grounds of lack of jurisdiction and its claims that the SEC did not follow due process. Coinbase had referenced a statement allegedly made by SEC Chair Gary Gensler during his appearance before Congress, where he reportedly claimed that market regulation of crypto exchanges was outside the scope of the SEC's authority and that only Congress could confer such regulatory power. Coinbase also pointed out that despite being a public company for two years, it was only recently that the SEC brought charges against the exchange for activities that had been thoroughly described to the regulator and the public. The outcome of this case will have significant implications for the regulation of cryptocurrencies and how they are traded within the United States. As the legal battle between Coinbase and the SEC continues, market participants eagerly await a resolution that could shape the future of the crypto industry.

The marketplace, dubbed the Arkham Intel Exchange, will feature a native token (ARKM) that is designed to ""deanonymize the blockchain.""  ""We believe that deanonymization is destiny in crypto markets, and that the intelligence technology built by Arkham will serve as a foundation for the self-regulation of the crypto economy,"" Arkham said in a tweet.  The token will be issued on the Binance Launchpad with 50 million tokens up for sale, which equates to 5% of the total supply. Each user will be able to buy $15,000 worth of ARKM tokens in the sale, which runs from July 11 to July 17.  The new platform uses a bounty mechanism that lets users post ""bounties"" for sought-after data. Blockchain researchers and sleuths can then source and provide information in return for the pledged bounty.  Cryptocurrency hacks and exploits broke records last year with billions of dollars worth of digital assets being stolen from cross-chain bridges, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and exchanges. Arkham aims to combat the proliferation of crypto hacks by incentivizing on-chain research, although concerns have been raised by several privacy advocates on Twitter.  Arkham has raised over $10 million from two rounds of equity financing with the latest equity round at $150 million, according to Binance's research page. Whilst 5% of token supply is allocated to the token sale, 20% will go to core contributors, 17.5% will go to investors and 17.2% will be put toward the foundation treasury.  ARKM Airdrop  Arkham also plans to distribute ARKM tokens to early adopters of the data intelligence dashboard. The program rewards those who promoted Arkham's growth by sharing referral codes, according to a follow-up tweet.

This eagerly anticipated solution comes at a crucial moment for Cardano’s native cryptocurrency, ADA, which has recently faced significant challenges following the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s classification of the token as a security. In the midst of these regulatory challenges, ADA managed to defy the odds and soar with an impressive 11% gain, according to an ADA price report. However, as of the time of writing, the price of ADA has once again dipped into the red zone. Steady Development Activity But Declining ADA Price Raises Concerns Cardano, a prominent blockchain platform, is currently experiencing a slight setback as the price of ADA has shed 0.3% of its value in the past 24 hours, with a seven-day decline of 3.0%, according to data from Coingecko. As of now, ADA is valued at $0.285.

Hydra Pay: a near-instant settlement L2 that can be integrated in all major Cardano wallets that’s effectively never congested, used for micropayments etc. Might become second nature for every Cardano user. Exciting and hopefully coming soon https://t.co/JdLqx8RkYu pic.twitter.com/Vj2ELqBIiR — ADA whale (@cardano_whale) July 8, 2023 The anticipation surrounding Hydra Pay stems from its potential to positively impact the price of ADA in the near term. Micropayments play a crucial role in the emerging Web3 ecosystem, enabling seamless and cost-effective transactions for various online services, content creators, and decentralized applications (dApps). If Hydra Pay delivers on its promise of revolutionizing this space, it could attract significant attention and usage within the Cardano ecosystem. Related Reading: Significant Surge: Large Shiba Inu Token Transactions Capture Spotlight Increased adoption of Hydra Pay could lead to a surge in demand for ADA tokens, as users seek to utilize the payment service for their micro-transactions.

14725231,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/bitcoin-big-move-gets-closer,1688982868,Bitcoin big move gets closer,"As bitcoin continues to trade sideways in a range, the next sharp move is not far from happening. Becalmed, but not for long Bitcoin looks to be reasonably comfortable as it sits on support at around $30,000. Not the heights of over $31,000 and a chance at breaking resistance, but a respectable sideways price action that could break soon. In fact, it’s only 5 days since bitcoin made a new high for the year, when it rose to $31,500 and looked as though it might break the strongest resistance it’s likely to meet in this bull market. Strong support below However, gravity took its toll and bitcoin has returned back down to $30,000. Should this break further to the downside, there is very strong support at around $29,300 and then down to $28,800. After that there is massive support at $25,000 which would also be bolstered by the 200 MA, plus the upward trendline that started at the beginning of the year. Dark economic clouds gather Things are still incredibly uncertain from an economic perspective. The lower inflation sequence could be about to be broken in the US, while remaining very persistent worldwide, particularly in countries in Europe and especially in the UK. On the horizon in August there is the BRICS summit, where a new rival reserve currency to the dollar could potentially be announced. The lack of decent Western mainstream coverage of such an earth-shattering economic event does not bode well for proper preparation from the West. Housing crises are also drawing near in many Western countries. UK mortgage holders are getting to the end of their fixed rate mortgages and will need to renegotiate them, facing a potential rise of at least 300% on their current payments. In addition, when the Summer comes to an end and Winter begins to demand vastly higher energy bills, an entry into recession will have been all but assured. Bitcoin about to prove its worth How bitcoin will perform in such an economic quagmire is really the million dollar question. So far it hasn’t become that inflation hedge that all were hoping for, but this could change. Money printing in the West is likely to start getting ramped up again as these economies desperately fight to get themselves through the Winter. Bitcoin, the scarcest asset in the world, and out of the reach of government manipulation, will have the chance to prove that it is a haven of safety. Those able to buy bitcoin, gold, or silver may want to do so before fiat debasement makes it so much more difficult. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

China's PPI, a measure of factory-gate prices, fell 5.4% year-on-year in June, the ninth consecutive monthly decline and the steepest drop in seven years, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said Monday.  That is likely to lead to lower export prices and deflationary pressures in the global economy. China is the largest trading partner of the world's prominent economies. Deflation, a sustained decline in the general price level, occurs when the inflation rate is negative.  Persistent deflation in one of the world's largest sources of manufactured products will help western central banks, whose aggressive interest-rate increases aimed taming inflation that's at the highest levels for years, and in some cases decades, is hurting the wider economy.  The Fed has raised rates by more than 500 basis points to the 5%-5.25% range since March 2022 and ran into a banking crisis early this year. In Europe, Credit Suisse had to be rescued by Swiss rival UBS.  ""China is exporting disinflation across the western world,"" David Brickell, director of institutional sales at crypto liquidity network Paradigm, told CoinDesk. ""We’re seeing it reflected in producer price inputs, but not yet fully feeding into consumer prices. Ultimately this will be good for risk as it relates to the end of the global hiking cycle.""  May's annual increase of 1.1% in U.S. producer prices was the smallest in almost 2 1/2 years. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 4%, the lowest in two years. Data due on Wednesday is expected to show the CPI growth rate slowed further to 3.1% in June, according to Refnitiv data cited by CNN.  Dull reaction to China PPI  So far, however, China's PPI data has failed to spark a risk-on rally, with bitcoin seeing little directional clarity above $30,000 and futures tied to the S&P 500 trading 0.5% lower on the day. The dollar index inched higher by 0.15% to 102.42.  It appears investors are currently focusing on the negatives of the data: A continued decline in the Chinese figure points to a stalled economic recovery. Early this year, analysts widely cited China's reopening as a major bullish tailwind for global growth and risk assets.  The post-data weakness in the S&P 500 futures and Asian stock markets can be attributed to the strong relationship between global earnings and Chinese producer prices. ""The latest PPI number does not bode well for earnings,"" Jeroen Blokland, founder of True Insights, said in a tweet.  According Brickell, bitcoin will probably begin the next leg higher once bond yields peak.  ""The knee-jerk reaction is to focus on the negative implications of a Chinese growth slowdown,"" he said. ""Risk assets are also adjusting to the last week's vicious bond sell-off. As yields top out, I suspect stocks will stabilize. I expect a reversal in yields to trigger the next leg higher for BTC, especially given the underlying weakness in the dollar.""  The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose to a four-month high of 4.09% last week, with the two-year yield hitting the highest since 2006 following Thursday's blowout U.S. ADP private payrolls data.  While Friday's nonfarm payrolls report showed a slowdown in job creation in June, the jobless rate dropped alongside an unexpected increase in average hourly earnings, keeping yields on a higher path.  Higher bond yields tend to reduce the flow of money into risk assets. Yields may turn lower if Wednesday's U.S. CPI data shows a continued slowdown in the inflation rate.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/10/bitcoin-steady-above-30k-as-china-factory-deflation-suggests-end-of-global-tightening-cycle-is-near,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f9c3914c446a99a55f73959421d615b33ee93462-1699x965.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Users reported receiving ""fake approval"" requests leaving users with exuberant transaction fees. Revoke, an approval management platform that helps users practice safer crypto wallet behaviour was forced to issue a fix after users reported a new crypto scam. Yesterday, we received reports of people seeing unknown approval transactions in their transaction history.It turns out that this is a new scam where scammers use so-called gas tokens to steal money when victims revoke these ""fake approvals"". pic.twitter.com/vpY2sGIv0T — Revoke.cash (@RevokeCash) July 9, 2023 Revoke.com received complaints over the weekend of a new crypto scam which baits users into revoking ""fake approvals,"" leaving them with excessively high transaction fees. The platform posted on Twitter that it had received reports of users seeing unknown approvals in the transaction history. Scammers Are Creating Fake Gas Tokens Revoke explained the scam involves scammers using so-called ""gas tokens"" to steal funds when victims revoke so-called ""fake approvals."" Gas tokens were developed after Ethereum network fees began increasing, allowing users to store ""cheap gas"" when network demand is low. Revoke explained this feature allows users ""to mint gas tokens when fees were low and burn them when fees were high, effectively ""locking in"" the lower fee."" The platform explained the scam operates by scammers creating fake gas tokens, which they airdrop with fake approvals to users, tricking them into thinking there are requests they need to revoke. The scammer's fake tokens are programmed to generate a lot of gas during the revoked transactions. The newly minted tokens are sent to scammers, leaving victims with high transaction fees. Revoke said: But the scammers programmed these fake tokens so that it mints a lot of gas tokens during a revoke transaction. These gas tokens are then sent to the scammers, who can sell them. This is scary because your wallet popup will not show that you're sending funds, just a high fee. Revoke Introduces Fix to Mitigate Scam Revoke acts as a tool to help users practice safer wallet behaviour. The platform manages or revokes active approvals such as those no longer required by decentralised finance protocols. In an effort to mitigate the fallout from the scam, Revoke added a check that disables revoking approvals if the gas fees are excessive, and urged users to ignore fake approvals. Revoke explained: Best thing to do with these fake approvals / fake tokens is to ignore them. As long as you don't interact with them, they can't steal your funds.

14723807,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541939,1688979638,Compound (COMP) Rises By 11% Amidst General Bear Market,"COMP, the native token of DeFi lending protocol Compound Finance, has drawn much attention following its positive price performance in the last day. According to data by CoinMarketCap, COMP has risen by 11.03% in the 24 hours, emerging as the top daily gainer of the market. This price rise is quite significant, as COMP recorded some price drops in the last few days, which may have prompted concerns for its numerous investors after the token’s remarkable, bullish form in recent weeks. COMP To Break Key Resistance Level? In the third week of June, COMP embarked on a stunning bullish run which saw the DeFi token gain over 125% to trade as high as $69.15 as of July 4. Related Reading: Compound (COMP) Token Rallies Over 100% After CEO Quits – Details However, after attaining this price level, COMP came under significant selling pressure, losing over 9.63% of its market value in the last week before experiencing its recent price boost today. Looking at its 4-Hour Chart, its Relative Strength Index – a tool for measuring the pace and variation of price movement – is set at 53 but is currently ascending toward the overbought zone meaning the current price uptrend may last for a while. In tandem, the token’s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line just crossed above the signal line, which is also interpreted as a bullish signal. Analyzing its price movement, COMP faces major resistance at the $70 price zone as the token has failed to break past this barrier twice in the last three weeks. However, if the market bulls are able to sustain the current buying pressure pushing past this price level, COMP is likely to resume its initial bullish trajectory. If the token fails to break past the $70 price zone, however, it will likely fall and retest at the $50.00 price mark, which currently represents its imminent support level. At the time of writing, Compound (COMP) is trading at $58.62, with a 0.60% decline in the last hour. The token’s daily trading volume is valued at $136 million, having gained by 216.75%. COMP Trading At $58.56 On The 4-Hour Chart | Source: COMPUSD Chart On Tradingview.com General Crypto Market In Red Amidst COMP’s market gain, a majority of the crypto market is experiencing slight losses, with the total crypto market cap declining by 0.77% in the last 24 hours, according to data by CoinMarketCap.

42410203,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcVCnO,1688979600,"15 Retail CBDCs Likely by 2030, BIS Study Says","Around 15 retail central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could be in circulation across the world by the end of this decade, according to a survey carried out by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).  BIS, a Switzerland-based body owned by 63 central banks representing around 95% of the world economy, said nine central banks had also indicated they're “very likely” to issue a CBDC for wholesale use in financial markets within the next six years.  Of the 86 central banks surveyed by BIS, 93% are now undertaking CBDC work, the study said, with major jurisdictions such as India, the U.K. and European Union all seriously exploring issuing a digital version of their fiat currencies.  “Global work on CBDCs has made further progress” since last year, the report said, with the work particularly intense in emerging economies where it’s seen as a way of helping unbanked people. “If issued, retail CBDCs can be expected to complement and coexist with other domestic payment methods.”  “The survey results show that, to date, stablecoins and other crypto assets are seldom used for payments outside the crypto ecosystem,” with cross-border remittances and consumer purchases the most popular uses, the report added.  The previous BIS survey published in May 2022 found the burgeoning private crypto market had spurred central banks to look at their options – and in some cases, enthusiasm may have cooled following the 2022 crypto crash. The number of central banks saying they’re unlikely to issue a CBDC any time soon has risen over the year, with fewer now sitting on the fence, the study found.  Earlier this year, the Bank of England said a digital pound is likely to be needed in future, while the European Commission in June produced a bill designed to underpin a digital euro. The U.S. Treasury has said it’s examining how it would keep digital transactions as private as possible.  Monetary authorities in the Bahamas, Eastern Caribbean, Jamaica and Nigeria have actually implemented a retail CBDC, while pilots of a digital yuan in China have raised fears about its potential of the technology for state snooping.

14723269,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541950,1688978391,Significant Surge: Large Shiba Inu Token Transactions Capture Spotlight,"Shiba Inu (SHIB), a cryptocurrency featuring an adorable dog-inspired logo, has witnessed a remarkable surge in large transactions. However, there’s more to the recent surge than initially meets the eye. What is the driving force behind the significant increase in Shiba Inu transactions? Could this be indicative of a larger trend unfolding in the cryptocurrency space? Amidst the noticeable surge in substantial SHIB transactions, it is crucial to acknowledge the significant outflows from prominent holders. This particular observation prompts us to question the underlying motives driving these transactions and the potential consequences they may have on the market. Substantial Surge In SHIB Transactions A remarkable surge in substantial Shiba Inu (SHIB) transactions has recently been reported. According to a SHIB price report, these transactions witnessed an astonishing spike, skyrocketing by an impressive 454% last Thursday. Source: IntoTheBlock Within the span of 24 hours, the cumulative number of these transactions reached an astounding 6.36 trillion tokens, translating into a substantial increase of $36.38 million in monetary terms. Related Reading: Litecoin (LTC) Price Weakens Below $100 As Bears Extend Their Grip SHIB market cap currently at $4.6 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Although there was a slight decrease in volume during the subsequent 24-hour period, the level remained significantly high. During the weekend, the recorded value settled at 4.49 trillion SHIB or $34.38 million. The ongoing enthusiasm and involvement in the Shiba Inu token indicate a consistent commitment to its engagement. Shiba Inu: Market Response And Price Analysis The surge in substantial SHIB transactions and the sustained interest and activity surrounding the Shiba Inu token raise questions about their potential impact on its price. While the reported increase in transactions reflects heightened market engagement, it does not directly indicate the direction of the SHIB price. SHIB on CoinGecko is at $0.00000760. Over the past 24 hours, there has been a slight decline of 1.0% in its price, while the seven-day period has witnessed a marginal decrease of 0.2%. Source: Coingecko The price of SHIB is influenced by a multitude of factors, including supply and demand dynamics, market sentiment, and overall cryptocurrency market conditions. Large transactions alone may not be sufficient to determine the price movement of SHIB, as they could be attributed to various motivations, including profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing, or strategic moves by institutional investors. Related Reading: PEPE Bulls Losing Steam? Fatigue Appears To Undermine Price Rally While the surge in transactions may initially suggest increased demand and positive market sentiment, the subsequent decline in volume could have mixed effects on the price of Shiba Inu. The decrease in transaction volume might indicate a temporary slowdown in buying pressure, potentially exerting downward pressure on the token’s price.

14722309,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541940,1688976300,"Solana (SOL) Price Hits Key Resistance, What’s Next?","In the fast-moving crypto world, one altcoin made particularly high waves last week: Solana. Within the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, the SOL price recorded the second highest price increase within the last seven days with 8.5%. And the unexpected surge in price for many has catapulted the SOL token to arguably the most crucial resistance at the moment: the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). Looking at the 1-day chart, the Solana share price was able to break above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $19.71, as predicted in our last chart analysis, and subsequently crossed the psychologically important $20.00 mark. While the first attempt failed, the Solana bulls celebrated a resounding success in the second attempt. However, as predicted in our last price analysis, there was increased selling pressure at the 200-day EMA currently at $21.97, to which the bulls succumbed. Similar to the last week of June, a consolidation may now be needed first to reset the technical indicators. In mid-June, SOL posted a 26% rally, followed by a seven day consolidation (bull flag). Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Price Targets 40% Rally Amid Strong Fundamentals A similar scenario could be possible now. A retest of the 38.2% Fibonacci level at $19.71 could be on the table. Remarkably, the pressure on the bulls is huge as the Solana token has failed to break the 200-day EMA since April 2022. The most recent rejection occurred in April 2023, followed by a 44% crash. However, the external circumstances in the crypto market are different now. Due to the hope for a Bitcoin spot ETF, new life has been breathed into the altcoin market as well. Solana, despite its strong fundamentals, has been hit particularly hard by the FTX drama and more recently the SEC’s declaration of it as a security. Accordingly, a recovery offers plenty of upside potential. If the 200-day EMA breaks, the 50% Fibonacci retracement level (at $23.36) would certainly be only a short intermediate level before the yearly high at $27.00, which also coincides with the 61.8% Fibonacci level. A break above this chart level could open the floodgates for an even more massive rally. Related Reading: Solana Registers 20% Rise In Past Week, But Can SOL Keep This Up? However, in addition to a general uptrend in the overall crypto market, this will certainly require a Solana-specific catalyst. For the recent rally, this does not really seem to exist. Reasons Behind The Recent Solana Price Rally While there isn’t a specific identifiable catalyst for Solana’s recent pump, several factors seem to be contributing to its upward trajectory. One driver has been the announcement of partnerships with notable entities. For instance, Coca-Cola in Serbia collaborated with Solana’s NFT platform, SolSea, to offer limited edition hoodies accompanied by NFTs during a music event. 🥤 Coca-Cola in Serbia teams up with SolSea NFT platform 🌊 for a unique collaboration at a music event 🎵. They’re giving away limited edition hoodies 🧥 and NFTs 🖼️ to lucky participants! pic.twitter.com/f4k3idGzvI — Solana NFTS Notification (@solananftsnews) July 9, 2023 Moreover, Solana’s popularity on social media platforms cannot be overlooked, as on-chain data firm Santiment noted. The bullish sentiment surrounding Solana has reached new heights, with Reddit forums buzzing about the coin’s potential. Market influencers and Reddit traders have likely played a role in driving Solana’s price action, as their influence on market movements is well-documented. This social media hype has undoubtedly added fuel to the fire, propelling SOL’s price even higher. Interestingly, Solana faced a regulatory hurdle in June when it was threatened with delistings from several US exchanges due SEC lawsuits. However, the allegation that SOL is an unregistered security is vehemently denied by the Solana Foundation. Regardless of the ultimate outcome, this regulatory uncertainty has cast a shadow over Solana’s future, indicating potential challenges ahead. But despite these obstacles, Solana has demonstrated resilience. After weathering the storm caused by the FTX bankruptcy, the platform has made an impressive recovery. Its technology, which enables rapid and reliable decentralized applications and cryptocurrency services, continues to captivate the market. This allure, coupled with the platform’s promising performance, has piqued the interest of investors and fueled expectations of further gains. So while the exact catalyst behind Solana’s surge remains elusive, the combination of partnerships, social media buzz, and its resilient technology paints a picture of a cryptocurrency on the rise.

14722494,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/rfk-jr-says-he-is-not-a-bitcoin-investor-records-show-otherwise,1688976300,"RFK Jr. Says He Is Not A Bitcoin Investor, Records Show Otherwise","Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr had recently stated during a May conference that he has not invested in Bitcoin. However, financial records have shown that he is indeed invested in the cryptocurrency. Robert F. Kennedy Jr’s Bitcoin Investment The Democratic presidential candidate had, during his appearance at the Bitcoin conference in Miami, told conference attendees that he was not an investor in Bitcoin, and neither was he in a position to give investment advice. However, he had stated that he was open to accepting campaign donations in Bitcoin. However, June’s financial documents showed otherwise, revealing that a brokerage account he held had between $100,000 and $250,000 worth of Bitcoin. Just hours after the information came to light, the Kennedy camp went into damage control, with campaign manager and former Democratic Rep Dennis Kucinich stating that the Bitcoin investment was made after the Miami conference speech and the June 30th filing deadline. According to the chief ethics counsel for the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, Virginia Canter, the situation could represent a conflict of interest. This is because Kennedy appeared to be touting Bitcoin on the campaign trail while his immediate family invested in the cryptocurrency. However, the Kennedy campaign has stated that there are no grounds for a conflict of interest. “I’m really concerned that he’s speaking at this conference, touting this investment to potential voters while the family has a history of owning Bitcoin. It’s like he could do the same thing for Procter and Gamble.” Details Of The Filing According to the filing, the Bitcoin holding in question made less than $201 as income. However, it does not specify when it was purchased and also does not reveal how much was spent on the original investment. It is also unclear whether the Bitcoin holding has been sold. The holding is listed under a section on the form that includes assets that could belong to spouses or dependent children and is intended to disclose holdings from the preceding calendar year to the current filing date. Hours after the story about the holdings broke, the Kennedy campaign stated that the investment was that of his wife and that Kennedy was not involved in business and investment decisions taken by his wife. However, they did not state when the asset was purchased and for how long it was held. However, the campaign later issued another statement, saying that the investment indeed belonged to Kennedy. “I was mistaken in my last communication. Mr. Kennedy does hold a Bitcoin investment, but it came later. At the time of the bitcoin speech, he had no cryptocurrency holdings.” Pro Crypto Stance Robert F. Kennedy Jr is part of a growing list of pro-crypto candidates, which also includes Republican Senator Ted Cruz and others such as Florida governor and presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis. Highlighting his support for Bitcoin and crypto in general, Kennedy had stated in a tweet, “Bitcoin is not only a bulwark against totalitarianism and the manipulation of our money supply; it points the way toward a future in which government institutions are more transparent and more democratic.” The tweet also included a video of a part of his speech at the Miami Bitcoin conference, where he described how he would be a pro-Bitcoin president. As a result, the Kennedy campaign has garnered considerable support from several wealthy supporters, even though he remains far behind President Joe Biden in the Democratic primary polls. These include billionaire Jack Dorsey and others such as Chamath Palihapitiya, Omeed Malik, and David Sacks. According to surveys, Biden has 70% support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters, while Kennedy has support among 17%. However, while Kennedy has adopted a pro-Bitcoin stance, the Biden administration has taken an aggressive approach towards crypto. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), under current chair Gary Gensler, has gone after several prominent entities in the crypto space, including Binance and Coinbase.

42419936,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGhDh,1688950938,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Opens Week Defending $30K Support Level,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: A bitcoin ETF might be a divisive idea for some in the industry, but it's all the market has on its mind.  Insights: The dYdX Foundation's Charles d'Haussy talks about the future of the platform post-Ethereum, and what he sees as developing regulatory trends.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s embrace of bitcoin – an about-face for the finance executive – is dividing analysts and the industry at large.  “So-called mainstream adoption will bring waves of new entrants to bitcoin, and the risk is that they won’t care, and won’t protect the decentralization properties that make it valuable over centralized alternatives in the first place,” Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy, wrote last week in his report.  But the market, at large, doesn’t seem to mind, not caring about the nuances of decentralization.  The world’s largest digital asset continues to defend the $30,000 mark, opening Asia’s trading week at $30,171. Ether is also holding above $1,800, trading at $1,863.  “In a largely uneventful week, we saw bitcoin trending downward to test support levels near $30K,” BitBull Capital’s Joe DiPasquale said in a note to CoinDesk. “However, the market leader managed to defend the key level despite news of the SEC calling ETF filings inadequate.”  BlackRock has refiled its application, and DiPasquale says the market awaits more clarity around this development.  “We still maintain that continued trading above $30K will see more attempts to go higher. Meanwhile, $27K remains a strong support for now,” he said.  Looking ahead to later this week, the market will have its eye on inflation numbers and jobless claims, two figures that the Fed will consider when making its next moves on rates. Expect crypto to trade accordingly.

In early April, the exchange announced it had launched a V4 of its private testnet, a pivotal step in its roadmap.  In a recent interview with CoinDesk at the IVS Crypto Conference in Japan, Charles d'Haussy, the CEO of the dYdX Foundation, explained the move by equating it to tech sovereignty. Having its own blockchain, he explained, allows dYdX to control its full tech stack and not depend on the speed and trade-offs of Ethereum's roadmap.  “When you sit on someone else’s blockchain, you have a dependency on their roadmap. It’s not yours,” he told CoinDesk. “By having our own chain, we are able to execute much faster by moving away from a general purpose blockchain.”  DYdX isn’t a new platform, but there’s renewed interest in it as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) goes after its centralized counterparts. The platform isn’t without its growing pains, and the question at the end of the day will be if its new technology stack is the cure. Its token is down roughly 6% in the last month as the price of ether is up 1.3%, meaning the market is taking a cautious look at this as the exchange prepares for its next chapter.  Part of Broader Trend  D'Haussy views dYdX owning its own blockchain as part of a broader trend where major crypto applications are optimizing for specific uses, thus making general-purpose blockchains less suitable.  “At the beginning, you start with a Swiss knife, doing everything, but eventually, you want to become a craftsman and have specialized tools,” he said. “So I think we’ll see a lot of application chains and more interconnectivity between blockchains.”  But this doesn’t mean that dYdX will be centralized around its own chain. D'Haussy also highlighted that dYdX is ""blockchain agnostic,"" continually evolving and upgrading its technology. He believes this kind of adaptability is a key characteristic of successful decentralized finance applications.  DYdX’s new blockchain will be open for other platforms to build on, but D'Haussy pointed out that it's specifically designed for its own uses, and likened it to a ""Formula 1 for decentralized finance.""  Diversity of validators  To prevent centralized failure, dYdX aims for diversity among their validators in geographies, underlying service providers, and types of providers. D'Haussy foresees a rise in domestic validators due to certain regions lacking regulatory clarity.  “We work on this to make sure that we've got a diversity of geographies, diversity of underlying service providers, a mix of cloud providers, a mix of what we call bare metal providers,” he said.  D'Haussy predicts that in the coming years, regulations may require financial institutions to access public networks via domestic nodes, in order to ensure that activities on-chain fall under the purview of local regulators, which will significantly increase the demand for domestic validators.  Which means regulated crypto derivatives trading — if you’re in the right part of the world.
