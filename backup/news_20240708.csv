The analyst joins several other analysts who have suggested that XRP could replicate its price gains from that bull run. How XRP Price Could Replicate 2017 Price Gains Dark Defender claimed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that XRP’s current pattern is identical to the 2014-2017 pattern and will remain so unless the $0.3917 “Point of Control” is not protected. The analyst explained that this Point of Control (POC) refers to the price level where most trades have taken place since 2014. Related Reading: Bitcoin Woes Not Over? Analyst Predicts Further Crash To $47,000 Therefore, with XRP maintaining this POC since 2014, the crypto token could replicate its historic price gain from 2017, when it rose by 61,000% in 280 days. In another X post, Dark Defender also claimed that XRP’s current pattern was identical to the 2013-2017 pattern he had previously highlighted. Considering this, he stated, “It will be an absolute art to see $5.85 and above.” Dark Defender also highlighted another indicator that shows XRP’s bullish prospects. He noted that the crypto token’s daily and weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at “the bottom and oversold.” He added that the monthly RSI is at the same level as March 2020 and November 2022. Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also stated that XRP might replicate its 2017 rally, given the current price action path the crypto token is following. He predicted that the crypt token could rise above $4 if this were to happen. Mikybull Crypto added that he was confident about this scenario playing out for XRP because the sentiment around the crypto token is bleak. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Javon Marks also alluded to XRP’s price gain when he recently predicted that the crypto token could witness a 39,000% price rally and rise to $200. He made this prediction based on his Full Logarithmic Follow-Through indicator, which he noted was supported by historical data. XRP To Still Rise To As High As $18.22 In his most recent X post, Dark Defender again predicted that XRP could rise as high as $18.22. He stated that the crypto had hit the latest Fibonacci support of $0.3917 (also the POC) of the 5 Elliot Waves, with a target of $1.88, $5.85, and $18.22 now in sight. He warned that any movement below $0.3917 could alter the structure he has been observing. Related Reading: Bitcoin Strikes A Chord At The Bottom, But Can It Clear This Major Resistance? Meanwhile, the crypto analyst mentioned that a bullish reversal is on the cards for XRP, alluding to the fact that the crypto token’s weekly RSI hit the lowest points, thereby signaling that XRP is an oversold area. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $0.42, down over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

30663128,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628457,1720476057,"Analyst Predicts ChainLink (LINK) Rally To $13 Could Result In 45% Price Correction, Here’s Why","The decentralized oracle network ChainLink and its native token, LINK, have staged a price recovery amid the broader cryptocurrency market’s bounce from a recent significant correction. Despite experiencing a 16% price retracement over the past month, LINK has regained its stronghold, rising 5% to $13 in the past 24 hours after hitting a six-month low of $11 on Friday. Still, cautionary signals have emerged that caught the attention of crypto expert Ali Martinez. Bearish Signals For ChainLink In a recent social media post, Martinez raised concerns about a pattern visible on LINK’s daily chart, suggesting the potential for a substantial price correction ahead. Specifically, the analyst highlighted a possible retest of the neckline of the head-and-shoulders pattern during the recent upswing to $13. Related Reading: Mass Adoption? NEAR Protocol Sees Over 12 Million Unique Addresses In 30 Days According to Martinez, this pattern indicates a continuation of the downtrend until the right shoulder is broken, meaning that the ChainLink price would have to break above the $20 level, the top of the right shoulder, to invalidate this scenario. If this scenario is as predicted, ChainLink could face a 45% correction. Martinez previously highlighted the likelihood of such a correction if LINK were to break below the $12.70 support level. The token’s price might retrace significantly in this bearish scenario, potentially reaching as low as $6.60. Notably, these levels were last witnessed in September 2023, before the commencement of the overall market uptrend that began in November of the same year. Key Levels For LINK’s Price Recovery Another analyst, Crypto Ambrosio, presents similar downward scenarios for the ChainLink price in a recent analysis of key indicators. The analyst suggests that if the 20-week exponential moving average (EMA), depicted by the yellow line in the chart above, remains above the current price action, it would serve as a notable bearish signal for the token. However, breaking above this indicator situated at $14.75 would invalidate this bearish outlook. Additionally, Crypto Ambrosio noted a downtrend pattern in the Relative Strength Index (RSI), further supporting the notion of a new downtrend for ChainLink. To counter these bearish signals, it is crucial for LINK to hold the $12 support level, as noted by the analyst. Ambrosio also believes that if ChainLink forms a Falling Wedge pattern and breaks the resistance at $15, it could signal a bullish reversal and pave the way for further price recoveries toward its yearly high of $22.89, reached in March. Related Reading: Bitcoin Starts July On A Bearish Note, Will CPI Data Change The Narrative This Week? The token must overcome key upper resistance levels while trading at $13.28 to initiate a potential price recovery. Upon analyzing the LINK/USD daily chart, the token will likely encounter its first significant challenge at the $13.52 price level, which has acted as a resistance for the past two months. Moreover, to invalidate the extension of the bearish scenario and surpass the 20-week exponential average, the ChainLink price would need to surpass and consolidate above the $14.38 resistance level.

This is according to bets placed by traders on crypto-based prediction market platform Polymarket.  Trump is expected to announce his pick for vice president next week, according to reports.  Sen. J.D. Vance, the Ohio Republican who is pushing to reform regulation of digital assets, has a 29% chance of becoming former President Donald Trump’s running mate, according to traders on crypto-based prediction market platform Polymarket.  Vance's odds of being nominated for vice president by the GOP have more than doubled from 14% a week ago on the platform, which settles bets in USDC, a stablecoin, or cryptocurrency that trades 1:1 with the U.S. dollars.  Read more: Pro-Crypto Ohio Senator J.D. Vance Is Donald Trump's Vice President Pick  The ""Hillbilly Elegy"" author and venture capitalist now has the second-highest odds of getting the Republican veep nomination among 25 possibilities offered in a Polymarket contract that has garnered $65 million of bets. The leading bet, however, is that another man not listed among the choices will get the nod, with a 33% probability.  Traders can buy ""yes"" or ""no"" shares for each candidate. Each share pays out $1 in USDC if the prediction comes true, and zero if not, so the market price (29 cents for a ""yes"" share in Vance, for example) represents the probability of the forecasted outcome.  A separate ""Republican VP nominee?"" contract with $7.6 million in bets puts North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum in the lead among 14 possibilities with 30% odds. Four-year-old Polymarket's volume has gone gangbusters in 2024 amid enthusiasm for political betting ahead of the November U.S. election.  Trump is expected to announce his pick before or during the Republican National Convention, which will take place from July 15 to July 18. Other possible contenders are Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson as well as former contestant Vivek Ramaswamy.  According to reports, Vance as of Sunday had not been asked to be Trump’s running mate, and neither had Rubio.

It's the first tokenized treasury product to achieve the milestone, taking only four months since its debut in March.  The growth for BlackRock's tokenized product has been fueled by other decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols such as Ondo Finance and Mountain Protocol using BUIDL as a backing asset for their own yield-products. Digital asset brokers such as FalconX and, most recently, Hidden Road, also added the token to collateral assets for their institutional investor clients across their networks.

30659690,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628443,1720470644,"Bitcoin Analyst Thinks Prices Must First Breach $50,000 Before Rallying","Bitcoin flash crashed on July 4 and 5, extending losses from all-time highs to about 30%. Though there was a relief bounce over the weekend, forcing the world’s most valuable coin up by nearly 11%, BTC remains within a bearish formation. Bitcoin Correction Not Over: Will Bears Break $50,000? One analyst who took to X confirmed this assessment, adding that the optimism over the last 48 hours could be quashed in the coming sessions. With BTC not out of the woods, at least from technical formation, the analyst predicted not only will the coin sink below last week’s lows, but it will likely break the psychological $50,000 mark. Pointing to historical price action, the coin said Bitcoin could drop to as low as $48,000 in the coming days, roughly 40% from its all-time high. When this happens, and following the price action seen in 2017, when the coin also crashed by 40% after local peaks, the coin will resume the uptrend. Even so, looking at the analyst’s assessment, the swing high and low anchoring of the Fibonacci retracement tool is subjective. For now, if September 2023 to March 2024 range acts as swing and lows, a 40% drop from local highs places Bitcoin $10,000 lower at around $37,000. Cracks are beginning to form on the weekly chart. After last week’s losses, the coin firmly closed below the 20-period moving average, placing sellers in control. Confirmation of last week’s losses could set the ball rolling, sparking more losses in the short term, pushing the world’s most valuable coin to $50,000 or even $40,000. How High Will BTC Jump After The Correction? However, after the cool-off and the depth doesn’t matter, another analyst predicts the coin will bounce off strongly. If BTC finds support at around the $47,000 to $50,000 level, the probability of it floating to at least $102,000 is high. This is the first level of the Fibonacci extension. At its high, the coin could soar to as high as $242,000 in the sessions to come. The confidence that BTC will bounce back after the current sell-off, sparked most by Mt. Gox liquidation fears and the constant dump by the German government, is based on history. After the Halving, Bitcoin prices tend to recover steadily. If anything, one analyst said holders shouldn’t panic sell within the first 79 days after the Halving event. Marking the beginning of the fifth epoch, the network reduced its miner rewards on April 20, roughly three months ago.

Former President Donald Trump's party is also committed to opposing a central bank digital currency.  Former President Donald Trump's Republican Party has officially adopted a platform that would seek to support cryptocurrency innovation, according to the document released Monday by the Republican National Committee.  The platform is meant to lay out the party's priorities as presumptive presidential nominee Trump and Republican congressional candidates head into the November election, and it reflects Trump and other GOP politicians' rising interest in digital assets.  ""Republicans will end Democrats’ unlawful and unAmerican Crypto crackdown and oppose the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency,"" according to the document. ""We will defend the right to mine Bitcoin, and ensure every American has the right to self-custody of their Digital Assets, and transact free from Government Surveillance and Control.""  In recent months, Trump flipped his earlier suspicion of cryptocurrency into staunch support. He's also had some personal experience with digital assets, having launched several of his own sets of branded non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

As other jurisdictions – including China and Europe – have pursued the idea of government-backed digital tokens, the U.S. hasn't moved beyond the research phase.  Republicans have accused Democrats of pushing for CBDCs that will allow greater financial surveillance of U.S. citizens. However, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and other government officials have insisted that such a theoretical digital dollar would be managed by the banking system, not the government.

This is significant considering what this could mean for the Bitcoin ecosystem, specifically Bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Drops To 79.5 T Data from CoinWarz shows that Bitcoin mining difficulty has dropped to 79.5 T at block 851,204 and hasn’t changed in the last 24 hours. This mining difficulty has continued to fall for a while, with further data from CoinWarz showing that it is down 5% in the last seven and 30 days. Related Reading: Finance CEO Raoul Pal Says Crypto Will Reach $100 Trillion Market Cap – Here’s When Bitcoin mining difficulty refers to how hard it is for miners to mine a new block on the Bitcoin network. The difficulty usually reduces when there is less computational power on the power and increases when miners are mining faster than the block average time of ten minutes. The recent drop in mining difficulty suggests that more miners are leaving the Bitcoin network. This is most likely due to the effects of the Bitcoin halving, which cut miners’ rewards in half. This has reduced the revenue from their mining operations, with many miners struggling to stay afloat, especially with increased competition. Bitcoin’s price action since the halving has also not helped, as the drop in the flagship crypto’s price has also affected their income. Bitcoin miner f2pool recently highlighted the profitability of various categories of miners at Bitcoin’s current price. The mining firm noted that only ASICs with a Unit Power of 26 W/T or less can make a profit at Bitcoin’s current price range. Crypto analyst James Van Straten also recently highlighted how “weak and inefficient miners” continue to be purged from the Bitcoin network. He claimed that the recent drop in mining difficulty shows that miner capitulation is closer to ending. Due to the low profitability that miners have faced since the halving, some have had to offload a significant amount of their Bitcoin reserves to meet operational costs, and others have had to exit the Bitcoin ecosystem entirely. What This Means For Bitcoin’s Price The decline in mining difficulty suggests that miner capitulation might be ending soon, which is a positive for Bitcoin’s price considering the selling pressure these miners have put on it. Bitcoinist reported that Bitcoin miners sold over 30,000 BTC ($2 billion) last month, which ultimately caused the flagship crypto to experience significant price crashes. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Sees Sharp 100% Decline In Whale Activity, Is This Good Or Bad For Price? Crypto expert Willy Woo also attributed Bitcoin’s tepid price action to these miners and mentioned that the flagship crypto will only recover when the “weak miners die and hash rate recovers.” He stated that Bitcoin would have to shed weak hands for this to happen, with inefficient miners going into bankruptcy while other mines are forced to buy more efficient hardware.

42417757,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZtT3,1720464791,Play-to-Earn Is Dead. Why Tap-to-Earn Marks a Big Shift,"Play-to-earn (P2E) games quickly came on the scene, but they failed. Why? P2E games tried to bring gamers into crypto, which we’ve all learned is not the key to trust nor mass adoption.  Instead, the focus has shifted. Give crypto-enthusiasts what they want: a way to earn crypto quickly and easily. While traditional P2E models often require complex gameplay and significant time investments, so-called “Tap-to-Earn” games offer a more accessible and engaging approach. By utilizing the social layers, such as Telegram, that live at the hands of consumers and tap into (no pun intended) where people already spend their time, a window into mass adoption has opened, intentionally or not.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's GameFi Theme Week.  Over the last three months, 210 million people have become CEOs of a simulated crypto exchange in Hamster Kombat, a viral clicker game in Telegram. Other successful Tap-to-Earns have relatively lower yet still remarkable numbers for Web3 gaming: TapSwap boasts 50 million total users, and in under one month, Yescoin surpassed 26 million active players. These stats resemble traditional Web2 games, yet these games represent the center of mass adoption at the heart of the Web3 ecosystem in Telegram.  Mini apps drive adoption  Telegram Mini Apps are one of the narratives or rather engines of this adoption cycle, and the Tap-to-Earn trend seems to have become its main fuel. Though mid-core Telegram games like Gatto or fantasy sports games like Fanton have shown good progress too, their user bases remain limited compared to the clicker giants.  It all started with Notcoin, which managed to attract over 40 million players since its launch on New Year’s Day 2024. 11.5 million of these became Web3 users by claiming Notcoin ($NOT) tokens after its listing on Binance, OKX, and other top-tier exchanges.  Their strategy was genius and it’s since been adopted by other viral apps like PixelTap. Here is the process: start with completely off-chain gameplay to avoid user friction, capture as many players as possible through incentives and referrals, and then announce an upcoming token airdrop.  Other strategies have worked quite well, too. Yescoin and Catizen (a popular P2E Telegram Mini App) introduced on-chain mechanics early on. Time will clarify how the different approaches chosen by each team affect conversion and retained users, especially once Hamster Kombat, TapSwap, and PixelTap launch their tokens. Catizen and Notcoin boast a conversion rate from an off-chain to an on-chain user of 7% and 6.2% respectively – much higher than Telegram’s 0.6% average.  Success factors  What is the secret sauce of a viral Telegram game? The obvious simplicity of the gameplay (e.g., clicking and completing easy quest tasks) and an entertaining game progression (e.g., finding new daily card combinations or ciphers as found in Hamster Kombat) is a major reason why Tap-to-Earn has seen incredible growth in such a short time frame.  The promise of community airdrops is another point of success for these types of games. Unlike DeFi protocols or Ethereum L2s, clicker apps do not require any complex on-chain actions, and Notcoin provided illustrative proof of that. Around 90% of the token supply went to the community with an average reward per wallet reaching $200, according to the Notcoin team. Catizen promises to airdrop 42% of the future $CATI, while the other above-mentioned apps have not revealed their tokenomics yet.  Another essential ingredient of success is leveraging the social layer and encouraging players to invite friends and compete in squads to get higher rewards. All these viral apps chose TON’s blockchain which can be explained by the ease of onboarding into Telegram, along with its global user base of 950 million, the technical advantages of the chain, and the recent success of Notcoin on top-tier centralized exchanges.  It doesn’t hurt to have big players in Web3 endorsing this strategy as well. Prominent Web3 gaming studio and venture capital firm Animoca Brands made a significant bet on Telegram and is now choosing TON as its Web3 partner, including Animoca-owned gaming platform GAMEE, which boasts 80 million-plus users, who recently announced the launch of their token on TON following the well-tested practices of other TON projects.  Not just fun and games  Notably, the Tap-to-Earn approach is being adopted by applications other than games. A hybrid crypto exchange Blumby ex-Binance top managers started with a simple clicker and Quest-to-Earn mechanism and managed to attract 30 million users before launching the core product functionality. This is an indication that Tap-to-Earn is essentially viewed as an effective onboarding tool and lucrative revenue source.  Many reasonably question the sustainability of the Tap-to-Earn trend as well as the quality of the attracted traffic. How teams will manage to educate and retain the user and offer long-term value remains an open question. Some plan to act as game publishers or quest platforms, while others promise to deliver e-commerce or trading products. Notcoin has succeeded in keeping its on-chain metrics on a decent level, sustaining the status of the largest meme coin by the number of on-chain token holders – almost 2.5 million.  In 2024, users feel that the apps and games deserving of their attention are those that reward everyone for their sweat equity, time and attention. Only time will tell how high the cat (or hamster) jumps. Telegram and TON remain open to all game types and genres, but mass adoption will apparently be driven by a modest few. One truth has become self-evident — the next industry giant is only a few taps away.

30652761,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628356,1720459844,Bitcoin ‘Extreme Greed’ Is Almost Here: Price Bottom Now Close?,"Data shows the Bitcoin sentiment is close to entering into the extreme greed zone. Here’s what this could mean for the cryptocurrency’s price. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Has Continued To Decline Recently The “Fear & Greed Index” is an indicator developed by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment that traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency market currently share. The index uses five factors to determine this sentiment: volatility, trading volume, social media, market cap dominance, and Google Trends. The metric uses a numeric scale that runs from zero to hundred for representing the mentality. Related Reading: Social Media Screams “Sell” As Bitcoin Crashes To $54,000: Buy Signal? All values of the indicator above the 53 mark suggest the presence of greed among the investors, while those below 47 imply the dominance of fear. The region in between these two thresholds correlates to a neutral sentiment. Now, here is what the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is looking like right now: As is visible above, Bitcoin Fear & Greed currently has a value of 28, meaning that the average investor is showing fear. The degree of fearfulness must also be quite notable, as this current value is pretty deep into the territory. In fact, the latest level of the indicator is quite close to a special region called the “extreme fear.” Investors display extreme fear when the index goes under 25. There is also a similar zone for the greed side as well, which is known as “extreme greed” and occurs above 75. During the first half of last month, the metric had been in or close to the latter region, but the recent downturn in the market has sharply degraded the sentiment to the other end of the spectrum. Historically, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have tended to show moves opposite to what the majority are expecting. The stronger the crowd’s expectation gets, the higher the probability of such a contrary move becomes. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Undervalued Now? Industry Expert Decodes The Market State The extreme sentiments are where the traders are leaning towards one direction too much. As such, major tops and bottoms in the asset have usually formed when the index has been in these zones. Because of this fact, some traders prefer to buy when investors are showing extreme fear and sell during extreme greed. This trading philosophy is popularly called “contrarian investing.” Warren Buffet’s famous quote sums up the idea, “be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” As the Bitcoin Fear & Greed index is approaching the extreme fear territory, it’s possible that the cryptocurrency could once again show profitable entry points soon, if the past is anything to go by. BTC Price Bitcoin has so far been unable to make too much recovery from its recent crash, as its price is still trading around $56,700.

30649041,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628386,1720454414,Is This Ethereum ICO Project To Blame For ETH’s Price Slump?,"The Ethereum price has fallen by around -25% since its mid-March peak at around $4,100 and is currently trading just above $3,000. While this loss is in line with the broader market trend and in particular Bitcoin’s price drop of about -22% in the same time, there could be another reason for ETH’s price slump, which seems plausible since the German government only sells BTC and not ETH, and Mt. Gox doesn’t own any ETH either. But what if Ethereum has its very own “Mt. Gox“? Is The Ethereum Price Suppressed By Golem? Chinese crypto journalist Colin Wu (@WuBlockchain) first reported via X on the significant movements of ETH funds by the Golem project, an Ethereum-based project that conducted a notable Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2016. According to Wu, “Golem, a project that raised 820,000 ETH in ICO in 2016, has transferred 36,000 ETH to Binance, Coinbase, Bitfinex, etc. in the past 37 days, worth about $115 million.” On-chain analysis service Lookonchain further revealed the extent of these transactions via X: “Golem has sold 24,400 ETH ($72M) on Binance, Coinbase and Bitfinex in the past 3 days, and currently holds 127,634 ETH ($372M). Golem raised 820,000 ETH through ICO in November 2016, when the price of ETH was only $10.2.” Related Reading: Justin Sun Potential $66 Million Loss Revealed As Ethereum Price Declines The Golem ICO was an early and significant event for the crypto industry which took place in November 2016. Golem aimed to create a decentralized supercomputer by harnessing the combined computing power of users’ machines, from personal laptops to entire data centers. The idea was to allow users to rent out their computing resources to others. In its ICO, Golem raised approximately 820,000 ETH, which was valued at around $8 million at the time, in just 29 minutes, becoming a symbol of the ICO bubble. This funding was supposed to be used to develop the Golem network. Despite its ambitious goals, Golem’s market relevance has significantly diminished, with its token now trading at just $0.32 (#151 by market cap), a stark decline from its peak price of $1.32 in January 2018. Harsh Criticism From Crypto Experts Criticism has been vocal among industry leaders. Adam Cochran, a partner at CEHV, expressed his displeasure via X: “Absolute bastards. Sat on their ETH for ages doing nothing. And here we are in the era of demand for distributed compute and they can’t even be relevant.” Related Reading: Doomsday for Ethereum? ‘A Crash Down To $1,500 Is Coming,’ Says Skeptic, Here’s Why Similarly, Jimmy Ragosa, an advisor at Sismo, sarcastically remarked, “Yes, Golem has been dumping on us. But, at least, they are using these 100s of millions of dollars to build critical scaling infra and widely adopted apps, right?” Another perspective came from @based16z on X, who speculated on the rationale behind Golem’s actions, “Say what you want about Golem, but they’re not exactly a gambler. For them to dump 700 million dollars in ETH after 7 years, I assume they know something.” How strong the influence of Golem sales is on the ETH price remains pure speculation. However, it seems clear that the constant selling pressure has probably played at least a certain role in the Ethereum price slump. At press time, ETH traded at $3,049.

The bitcoin price fell to as low as $55,000 before recovering.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} fell on Monday afternoon in Europe as the German government transferred over $900 million worth of assets from its bitcoin holdings, blockchain data shows.  According to blockchain data platform Arkham Intelligence, Bitcoin wallets labeled as belonging to the German government moved a total of roughly 16,309 BTC in several batches to external addresses, including to crypto exchanges Bitstamp, Kraken and Coinbase and market makers Flow Traders and Cumberland DRW.  Bitcoin's price dropped 3% to as low as $55,000 shortly after the last group of blockchain transactions totalling 8,700 BTC. Later, it rebounded to slightly above $56,000, still down 1.2% over the past 24 hours.  The price action came after last week's slide to the lowest price since February. Market observers pointed to a massive supply overhang coming to the market during the relatively quiet and low-volume summer season with the German and U.S. governments apparently selling seized assets just as the defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox starts to issue repayments.  With the latest transfers, the German government is more than halfway through its selling spree, with holdings now reduced to 23,788 BTC worth $1.3 billion from 50,000 BTC since it started unloading tokens last month, according to Arkham data.

For example, the Spot Ethereum ETFs did not debut on July 2nd as expected, and the US and German governments have been reportedly selling large tranches of BTC. However, a turn in the tide could be coming for Bitcoin and crypto at large as the CPI data is expected to drop on July 11. CPI Data Could Move The Narrative For Crypto Crypto analyst CrypNuevo took to X (formerly Twitter) to share their thoughts on where they expect the Bitcoin price to be headed next. Pointing to the upcoming CPI data, CrypNuevo explains that a rate cut could be imminent in the CPI data that is expected to be released on Thursday, July 11. Related Reading: Dogecoin Vs. Shiba Inu Vs. PEPE: Comparing The Profitability Of The Top Meme Coins With the inflation data expected to come in lower, this could point to an immediate rate cut or at least a further rate cut by the Fed going forward. Naturally, such rate cuts would be good for the Bitcoin price as they have been in the past. “A rate cut or an imminent rate cut announcement would be greatly received in the crypto market and I believe that we would see prices going up aggressively in that case,” the analyst said. “I don’t discard that if we get a good CPI on Thursday, we see that reversal for that day, because the market tends to price-in what’s to come from the FED,” CrypNuevo explains further further. Will The Bitcoin Bearish Trend Continue? For the analysis, the crypto analyst used the BTC 1-Day chart which showed a rather peculiar wick that the analysis expects to be filled. This wick is the $53,400 wick that occurred in early July before the market recovery, but the analyst does not believe that it is over for the price. Firstly, the analyst expects at least 50% of the wick to be filled, something that already happened over the weekend when the price fell to $54,000. Related Reading: Finance CEO Raoul Pal Says Crypto Will Reach $100 Trillion Market Cap – Here’s When On to the topic of the wick being 100% filled, it could be bullish for the price as the crypto analyst expects that falling to this level could see the price bounce from here. However, there is also the possibility that the price fills this wick and then falls further down. In such a case, the crypto analyst believes that $51,700 would hold for the Bitcoin price. This means that this would be the next support level for bulls to hold. A recovery from here would likely see the price barrel toward $60,000, but the analyst maintains that $60,000 is now resistance for Bitcoin.

42417764,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZtbJ,1720447432,Prediction Markets and Polls Both Got the French Election Wrong,"This week in prediction markets:  Nobody could predict France's electoral upset  The market is skeptical that Biden is staying in  Kalshi bettors put ether at $2,630 by year's end  Prediction markets often outperform polls in forecasting elections – but sometimes both get it wrong. The French election was one such case.  A week ago, it looked like France's right-wing National Rally party would secure a majority in the country's National Assembly. Bettors on Polymarket, the crypto-based prediction market platform that's riding high on U.S. election betting this year, were signaling a 97% chance that the National Rally would win the most seats. This was in line with polls.  Neither the prediction market traders nor the polls saw a hung parliament (an inauspicious development for France's domestic crypto legislation) coming.  A concentrated get-out-the-vote campaign by the French left, and the strategic use of coalition parties meant that when everything was counted, the National Rally came in third place to the Ensemble (ENS) (which supports incumbent President Emanuel Macron) and the UG Union of the Left parties.  So does that mean a windfall for the Polymarket traders who bet ""no"" on the question of whether Marine Le Pen's party would win the most seats? Not necessarily.  As often happens when there's an unexpected result, there's a dispute over how this Polymarket contract should be resolved.  This dispute concerns whether coalitions like Ensemble should count as parties. If they don't, then the National Rally still technically won the most seats, despite losing the election.  ""The 'Liste des nuances' includes both individual parties and coalitions, which supports the interpretation that the official French election results do not strictly differentiate between the two types of entities,"" wrote bettor kipakipa, who had a ""no"" bet on the National Rally winning the most seats. ""This is important for resolving the market because it suggests that official results treat coalitions as significant and comparable entities alongside individual parties.""  Some of the largest bettors on the No side bought in at 8 to 10 cents per share, meaning that if the contract resolves in their favor, they will be in for a large payout of $1 per share. Currently, the user known as asc has the largest bag on the no side with 24,192 shares that he or she purchased for an average of 10 cents a share.  Eye on Biden  ""I’m the sitting President of the United States. I’m the nominee of the Democratic party. I’m staying in the race,"" Joe Biden's campaign posted on X on Friday, hours before ABC News broadcasted his interview with George Stephanopoulos.  Markets were not convinced.  The President's reelection odds remained at 11% on Polymarket after the ABC interview, CoinDesk reported over the weekend, though they ticked up slightly to 15% by Monday. Biden's chances of dropping out lingered around 65% after the broadcast, sliding to 57% by Monday – leaving a still better-than-even chance he'll throw in the towel.  On Monday morning U.S. time, Biden reiterated: he's not dropping out. The President's re-election campaign took to X to post a letter he shared with Democrats that outlined his commitment to run again, and asked the party to come together to defeat Republican Donald Trump at the polls.  This sent the odds of him dropping out a few percentage points lower to 50%, but his chances against Trump remained virtually unchanged.  While Biden may intend to stay in, some lawmakers, and, crucially, donors, are trying to get him to reconsider.  Other related contracts are giving Biden a 37% chance of being nominated before the Democratic National Convention in August, and a 53% chance that a ""major candidate"" announces he or she intends to challenge Biden at the convention for nomination.  Both White House staffers and DNC elites are no doubt looking at Biden's approval numbers as the convention – and the formal kick-off of the campaign – gets closer.  On U.S.-regulated platform Kalshi, which is not allowed to offer direct bets on races for U.S. political offices, there is a market to bet on Biden's rating on 538, a poll aggregator, by the end of the month. Currently, bettors are saying that it'll be approximately 36%, lower than former president Trump's numbers from Gallup in July 2020.  Ether at $2,600?  Even though ether {{ETH}} has been showing some strength as traders anticipate Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) possibly hitting the market in the near future, Kalshi bettors are forecasting that the cryptocurrency will test $2,600 by the end of the year and maybe even dip under $2,000.  Currently ether is trading above $3,000.  The crypto market has been giving mixed signals, with bitcoin seeing some of its worst performance since the height of the 2022 FTX crisis. Overall, the world's largest digital asset is down more than 17% in the last month, according to CoinDesk Indices data.  Ether has largely followed bitcoin's direction, though throughout the Monday trading day in Asia it did find support as sellers hit an exhaustion point.  A big question will be how much support an ETF will give ether. Bitcoin is flat since Jan. 11, the day the ETFs started trading, while ether is down 11% in the same time period. That's the kind of support roughly $14.7 billion in inflow can bring to an asset.

42417761,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZtZF,1720446847,Catizen’s Tim Wong: 'We Are Here to Build a Business Ecosystem',"Mobile gaming is big in China. It has been for years. Much of the country plays so-called “mini-games” on their phones, often via WeChat messenger. The games are simple and fun and addictive. “It was a fast-growing, very attractive ecosystem with millions of games,” says investor Tim Wong, who poured equity and energy into hit WeChat games.  This interview is part of CoinDesk's GameFi Theme Week.  But the WeChat universe was crowded. What about a new and flourishing platform? What about…Telegram? And what about incorporating some new tools unlocked by Web3? “We saw the potential,” says Wong. “And, we wondered, is it possible for us to copy the success of the WeChat mini-game to the Telegram ecosystem?”  The short answer is yes.  In January 2024, “Catizen AI” launched on The Open Network, aka TON — Telegram’s Web3 ecosystem. The game is booming. Since January they’ve amassed 23 million players, with 1.3 million having on-chain activity, according to the company.  The secret to this explosive growth? Part of it is the strategic use of airdrops (an incentive for game engagement), part of it is the new tools from Web3 (a sneaky-powerful way to scale player acquisition), but the biggest part is something rather old-fashioned. “Fundamentally, a game has to give you emotional value,” says Wong, who’s now Chairman of the Catizen Foundation. And that emotion starts with Wong’s own stray cats.  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  Where did the idea for Catizen come from? Why cats?  Tim Wong: I mean, all the co-founders are cat lovers. I myself have adopted three stray cats. One of them is called Sunflower, one is Eleven, and one is Yonghua, a Chinese term for prosperity. I mean, we love cats.  And we knew that cats are a universal language, per se. There are so many cat lovers in the world. In countries where the birth rate is dropping, for some couples, cats are becoming like a third member of the family.  We also looked at the geographic user profile of Telegram. You’ll see countries like Russia and Ukraine, and these places are really cat lover countries. We knew that we had to do something about cats.  What are some of the Web3 tools and features that have enabled your rapid growth?  The first is with user acquisition. In Web2, you start to pay ads and you pay Facebook and you pay Instagram, and the cost of acquiring a new user keeps going up, and you’re not left with much. We look at Web3 economics as a low-cost, innovative way to acquire new users.  I don’t know the numbers exactly, but in the Web2 world, maybe you spend 100 bucks for a new user. In Web3, if you have a good game and you have enough attention, you can push out a player referral program, and even before your token is listed you can say, “Hey Jeff, refer your friend, and we’ll give you the equivalent of one CATI token.” It’s a low-cost way for developers to acquire new players. Or if your friend makes in-game purchases, we can give you profit-sharing. That’s impossible in a Web2 world.  What are some other Web3 benefits? I’m guessing a big one is that now players can truly own in-game purchases, and their assets are no locker locked into one platform.  Yes, we’re on the same page. And also, Web3 tools allow for asset flows between games. So in our game platform, with the CATI token, if you’re bored with one game, you can transfer your asset to the second game. While in the Web2 world, you rush the risk of the gaming company just closing down the server and all of your purchases from the past are gone.  The airdrop model is obviously crucial to TON games’ growth. Can you talk about how you’ve been thinking about airdrops?  I think users now like projects that have no investors in the tokenomics. They like less investors, more airdrops to the players, so they get more benefits. And for us, all we wanted to do, fundamentally, is develop and publish games that are actually fun to play. We want to give emotional value to players that play our games. We’re not here to launch a game, get attention, list the token, sell the token, make money, and forget about it. We are here to build a business ecosystem that can last or, I don’t know, 10, 20, 30 years, maybe until I retire.  Do you have a sense of who’s playing the game, as far as Web3 veterans or Web3 newbies?  I can give you a figure, actually. We have about 500k paid-in players. So 500k players who spend some sort of money or token in our game, which is a lot. And roughly 50% of them, according to our stats, have never had a Web3 token wallet before.  We get a lot of consumer-type players, which proves that our team has the ability to make good games that people are willing to play without the expectation for something monetary in return.  Your game is officially called Catizen AI. What’s the role of AI in this, exactly?  Our adoption of AI is maybe not as sexy or exciting as one might think. But we have this program called Catizen, Always by Your Side, which was in our initial roadmap.  As cat lovers, we want players or users or fans to be able to carry a cat around. So we are working with Google’s Web3 AI team to develop this function where for the cats you own in the game, you can take the image out, and with your phone, you can take a photo [in real life] but then the cat will be there.  And then the AI will train your Augmented Reality cat, in accordance with how you interact with a real-life cat.  That actually is interesting and sexy! I mean to the extent that cats are sexy. Long term, though, what’s the secret for these TON games becoming sustainable?  Fundamentally, you’ve got to be a good game by Web2 standards. You can’t play tricks, just to get hype and then it dies off after one or two years. That’s now what we’re trying to do, that’s not what we believe in. I think successful GameFi should be a combination of what I said earlier — Web3 tools for user acquisition, and asset flow between games — and a focus on the player experience. It has to be a game that’s fun to play. It has to be about emotional value.  What do you mean by that exactly, emotional value?  With Catizen, here’s something that’s interesting. A lot of our players are in Russia and Ukraine. These are warring countries. And I think of it in a way where these people are in warring countries, and they come home when they are in a sad mood, they go on Catizen and are like, “Oh my god, these are really cute, funny cats.” If, I don’t know, even one out of 10,000 people feel that kind of joy and comfort, then we’re doing something meaningful here.",POSITIVE,TON,ASIA | BUSINESS | TON | AIRDROP,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/07/08/catizens-tim-wong-we-are-here-to-build-a-business-ecosystem,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1d3e266c74fe8116929ff63cfe03c621409efca6-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417750,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZtMr,1720446210,"Stablecoins, Miners Outperform as $18B Gets Wiped Out From Crypto in June: JPMorgan","The total crypto market cap declined by 8% in June, the bank said, noting that March 2024 might have been the peak of the current cycle.  JPMorgan noted that spot bitcoin ETFs saw their second-worst month since launch, with an estimated $662 million of net outflows.  The market cap of the U.S.-listed miners grew almost 20% as the sector re-rated due to AI-related power use cases, the report said.  The total cryptocurrency market cap fell by 8% in June to around $2.25 trillion, giving back most of the gains from May, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report on Monday.  “Tokens, decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) all saw market cap contraction in June,” analyst Kenneth Worthington wrote.  The move is in contrast to traditional markets as the S&P 500 index gained 4% for the month, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq climbed 6%, the bank noted. The CoinDesk 20 index {{CD20}} fell almost 20% in June.  However, it's not all doom and gloom for the digital assets sector. Stablecoins outperformed the rest of the crypto ecosystem in June, and their market cap was flat to slightly higher, the report said, with the appreciation driven primarily by tether {{USDT}}.  Bitcoin miners were also an outlier. The total market cap of the publicly listed bitcoin {{BTC}} miners grew 19% as these companies benefited from gains due to “artificial intelligence-related power use cases.” Core Scientific (CORZ) recently inked a 12-year, 200 megawatt (MW) deal with cloud computing firm CoreWeave to provide AI-related infrastructure, which triggered a re-rating of the sector and a wave of mergers and acquisitions.  The bank noted that the data suggests that daily spot crypto trading volumes fell as much as 18% versus the previous month, and “it now appears that March 2024 was the peak for the crypto ecosystem in the current cycle both from a valuation and volume perspective.”  JPMorgan added that spot bitcoin ETFs saw their second worst month in terms of flows since launching, and estimates that the 10 U.S. spot ETFs saw $662 million of sales over the month.

42417763,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZtaH,1720444683,How Memes and Gamification Are Changing Finance As We Know It,"Make money with your friends while laughing at an inside joke? What could be better than that?  Memes are taking over finance. And, behind the community forums, comical volumes of wealth emerging within days, and sometimes-crude humor, something tremendous and meaningful is happening.  Memes: More than JPEGs  On the surface, memes are just photos and video clips that zip around the internet in text messages, social media timelines and community forums. It’s easy to overlook them and dismiss that they may carry with them more than a humorous reference. Memes transmit subtle but powerful cultural meaning in a digitally-native way. A meme that is popular to a community or a culture often signifies something about that group and their values in that particular moment in time.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's GameFi Theme Week.  Blockchain technology has offered the capacity to financialize nearly anything that is digitally-native, so it’s only natural that crypto has captured meme culture over the years. However, meme-ified finance is not unique to crypto. Across traditional and Web3 finance, meme-ified finance has brought together powerful online groups. And now financial gamification, though still in a rudimentary state, is revealing a new path forward.  In TradFi, a fringe Reddit community in 2021 became a harbinger for the type of community-first, anti-institutional, anti-sensible finance that is deeply and inextricably linked to the intersection of gamification and humorous meme culture. The r/wallstreetbets community “stuck it” to traditional finance, gaming the traditional stock market and reveling in their success with facetious online posts.  In crypto, memecoins have always played a major role — appealing to the type of community-first finance that typically spreads through the power of memes and market gamification. Early memecoin iterations like DOGE were followed by use-case-specific versions like NFT collections, and today are accelerated by next-gen, low-cost blockchains like Solana.  This raises an ongoing debate: Do memecoins need intrinsic value to be successful, or does the enthusiastic support and participation of their communities suffice? When we talk about “value,” are we referring to a solid roadmap and utility, or is the real value in the vibrant communities and the culture they create? Perhaps the true worth of memecoins lies in their ability to unite and engage people rather than conform to traditional financial metrics.  It’s fun to make money with your friends  All that is happening — both in traditional and crypto finance — speaks to something emergent and powerful. After decades of obscure, obfuscated, straight-laced, ivory tower financial services, people are moving in an opposite direction. Discovering collective financial power and then applying that power to markets goes hand in hand with technologies that connect people on a daily, global basis (e.g. Reddit) and that democratize financial autonomy (crypto). All of this is wrapped up in humorous, meme-based communities and financial gamification that is, at the end of the day, simply fun.It seems hard to imagine a world where such community-powered, entertaining wealth creation will do anything but grow.  We can think about the meme-ification and gamification of finance as the result of the folding of technologies into one another. To date, the different ways that we’ve spent our time online have been fairly distinct. Social platforms, financial platforms, education platforms, gaming platforms, etcetera, have all been separate from each other — cordoned off into their own digital siloes.  Over the last 20 years, some of these sectors have folded into one another already. Gaming and social media are already inextricably linked, with platforms like Twitch specifically targeting the intersection of the two. Under the force of crypto, we’re starting to see finance fold into social media as well.  Undoubtedly, APAC is significantly ahead of the west in terms of this folding of technologies. Platforms like WeChat seamlessly combine commerce, social media, gaming, communication, and more. When all these technologies fold into one another, what is the shared thread among what were once separate ecosystems? Culture. And how does culture spread online? Memes. We might not know what the next product is that will fulfill everyone’s needs, but one thing we can guarantee is that everyone needs happiness, and that is memes.  Laughing down the road  Crypto is changing the face of finance, but it’s not happening in a technological vacuum. It is accelerated by memes and by the deep economic gamification that is core to blockchain systems. The power of finance is no longer in knowledge of esoteric financial principles. It’s no longer even in the kind of relationships built in stoic financial corporations. The power is in community, in virality, and in deep cultural synchronicity.  Welcome to the Meme Age.

NEAR Protocol Sees Over 12 Million Unique Addresses In 30 Days,"The NEAR Protocol blockchain is seeing an increase in in user activity, sparking a great deal of positive vibe for its future. Transaction volumes and active addresses have been up in recent months, pushing the protocol up into the spotlight of the cryptocurrency community. Market observers point to several factors driving this growth, including the protocol’s focus on scalability, low fees, and its ambitious foray into artificial intelligence (AI) integration. Related Reading: $2.4 Billion Worth Of Bitcoin Exit The Network As Bear Market Bites Active Users Flock To NEAR Scalable Ecosystem Data suggests a significant rise in user engagement on the NEAR blockchain. According to analyst reports, it boasted the highest number of active addresses (almost 17 million) compared to other top chains in June. This growth in user figures was in line with other positive metrics, including the network’s impressive success rate (almost 100%!) and low transaction fees. Notably, NEAR also ranked second in terms of total transactions processed (239 million) and average transaction speed (measured in Steps). In June, @NEARProtocol compared to the popular chains was👇 #1 in the number of Active Addresses (16.9m) #1 in low-cost fees (< $0.005) #1 in Success Rate (99.9%) #2 in Average STPS (94) #2 in Number of txns (239m) 55% retention of May Users with 12.3m new Users More 👇 pic.twitter.com/HT71ehkIb3 — Masi (@Masi_DN) July 5, 2024 Furthermore, the NEAR ecosystem has managed to retain a significant portion of its user base. Reports indicate a 55% retention rate for users who joined in May, with a staggering 12.3 million new users onboarding in June alone. AI Integration: A Strategic Play For The Future Beyond its focus on scalability and user experience, NEAR is making strategic bets on emerging technologies. The establishment of the NEAR AI R&D Lab signifies the protocol’s commitment to integrating AI functionalities into its blockchain. This focus on AI is seen as a potential differentiator, attracting developers and users who are bullish on the future of AI-powered blockchain applications. The potential applications of AI in the NEAR ecosystem are vast. Imagine a future where AI facilitates faster transaction processing, streamlines smart contract execution, or even personalizes user experiences within DeFi applications built on NEAR. While these applications are still in their nascent stages, the strategic focus on AI positions NEAR as a potential leader in this evolving space. Price Poised For A Rebound? The surge in user activity and the protocol’s innovative approach have had a positive impact on the price of NEAR tokens. After experiencing a recent decline, the price of NEAR has shown signs of recovery, with a 5.27% surge in the past 24 hours. Technical indicators, such as the Money Flow Index (MFI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), suggest a potential reversal of the bearish trend. However, analysts caution against overly optimistic price predictions. The cryptocurrency market remains volatile, and the “Fear & Greed Index” currently indicates a cautious market sentiment. While a price forecast suggests NEAR could reach $14.20 by August 7, 2024, it’s crucial to remember that such predictions are inherently speculative. Related Reading: XRP Stages A Comeback: Aims To Reclaim $0.50 After Recent Plunge The coming weeks will be crucial for NEAR. If the user base continues to expand and the protocol successfully integrates AI functionalities, a sustained price increase could be on the horizon.

The firm has already invested ""close to $20 million"" in several projects including Pyth and Berachain over the past quarters, CIO Ben Roth told CoinDesk.  Crypto trading firm and market maker Auros said in an exclusive interview with CoinDesk that its newly established venture capital arm plans to invest more than $50 million of its own capital in early-stage digital asset ventures in the next two years.  To lead the investment efforts, the company appointed Julien Auchecorne as head of Auros Ventures. Auchecorne previously held roles at hedge fund Brevan Howard and digital asset services platform XBTO International, among other crypto and traditional investment firms.  The announcement comes at a time when crypto VC investments have rebounded in the first half of 2024 after a grueling capital drought following the dramatic implosion of crypto firms such as FTX in 2022 as many investors lost conviction or pivoted to other red-hot narratives like artificial intelligence (AI).  The expansion also marks a milestone in Auros’ turnaround after being badly hit by the collapse of FTX in late 2022. Auros co-founder and CIO Ben Roth said in the interview that the market maker now estimates that it handles roughly 4% of the global crypto trading volume on exchanges.

These investments include data provider Pyth, high-performance layer-1 blockchain Berachain and many infrastructure and decentralized physical infrastructure (DePin) projects and stakes in exchanges.  Roth told CoinDesk that the VC arm focuses on helping companies scale operations, with Auros being the “power user” of their services. He noted that the firm’s goal is to form “strategic partnerships” with their portfolio companies and not use investments as a “client acquisition tool” for their market-making business, as is the case with some other market-maker investments in the industry.  Speaking about the firm’s approach to allocating funds, Auchecorne explained that Auros plans to make “concentrated bets” predominantly in seed and series A stage projects, focusing on areas where “the next billion of recurring users will come” to crypto.  “We are not interested in carpet-bombing the industry with checks,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/07/08/digital-asset-trader-auros-to-invest-over-50m-in-crypto-startups-through-its-newly-established-vc-arm,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6dfd7c6a3f36695fa149ebb85ca288c6c5f239be-800x450.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417768,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZtcL,1720443485,What Hamster Kombat Did: How Telegram Built a Web3 Gaming Juggernaut,"Two months ago the president of Iran, Ebrahim Raisi, was killed in a helicopter crash. Iran held an election to replace him, but there was a hitch: According to a senior official in Iran’s military, the nation’s citizens were too distracted to properly vet the candidates. Millions of Iranians, supposedly, were too busy clicking on their phones.  They were hooked on a crypto game called “Hamster Kombat.”  This feature is part of CoinDesk's GameFi Theme Week.  The game seems to have come out of nowhere. In March, it launched on TON, aka The Open Network, a Web3 ecosystem built on Telegram. Now the game is so popular that Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayyari, Iran’s deputy chief of the military, accused it of being part of the West’s “soft war” on Iran’s government. As the AP reported, Sayyari said that “One of the features of the soft war by the enemy is the ‘Hamster’ game.”  So is the United States really weaponizing Web3 hamsters against Iran? It’s a fascinating (if wild) question, but in some ways the answer is irrelevant. The question’s very existence is what matters. “This has become so fucking big, even politicians started talking about it,” says Inal Kardan, Gaming Lead at the TON Foundation.  Hamster Kombat’s founder is anonymous; the project declined requests for an interview. (Clearly it’s the CIA.) But they claim to have over 200 million users; they have 11 million followers on Twitter/X, and their YouTube account has 31 million subscribers.  This is just one of several “GameFi” projects on TON with eye-popping growth. Web3 games are flourishing. The cute and cartoony “Catizen” (the sponsor of CoinDesk’s GameFi theme week] has over 23 million users. TON’s first big success story, “Notcoin,” has over 40 million.  In total, there are now 500 million users on the TON network, according to the foundation. With a current market cap of $19.4 billion, Toncoin has surged to become the eighth largest project in all of crypto -- leapfrogging mainstays like Polkadot, Cardano, and NEAR.  But the Iranian military isn’t grumbling about Polkadot or Cardano. TON games feel different. They’re simple and fun and it seems they’ve broken out of the crypto echo-chamber, finding a mainstream audience, a la NFTs in 2021. “This is not just about the degens,” says Kardan. “This is about normies doing something with blockchain for the very first time.”  One reason for the explosive growth of TON is the global reach of Telegram itself, especially in Europe and Asia. Telegram has over 900 million users. But as recently as December of 2023, according to Kardan, only 1% of them used Telegram to play games. Entrepreneurs sniffed an opportunity.  “We looked at Telegram and TON, and we thought, this is virgin land,” says Tim Wong, Chairman of Catizen Foundation. So games like Catizen, Notcoin, Yescoin, and Tapswap quickly filled the void, partly because they can be easily (even mindlessly) played while waiting for an elevator.  “All of them are hyper-causal, really simple games,” says Kardan. “That’s what people like.” The Telegram games are easy to install, easy to play, and easy to connect to crypto. (At least internationally--Telegram’s native crypto wallet is not available in the US, due to regulatory concerns.) For 15 years, the web3 space has been dogged by clunky interfaces and confusing protocols. TON seemed to have solved that overnight.  The buttery smooth UX is why DeFi analyst David Zimmerman wrote a research paper concluding that TON is “well-positioned to become crypto’s killer app,” as it has “done more to progress in these areas [UX and real-world use cases] than any other crypto market participant.” TON games are simple. In a phone interview, Zimmerman says that in all his years covering crypto, whenever he introduced his “normie friends” to Web3 projects, it would typically take a 40-minute tutorial filled with confused questions. With TON? He’s already onboarded 10 friends.  The games themselves are clever, appealing, fun. You can start playing Catizen in seconds, clicking on little kittens and watching coins magically appear (more on this later). You earn rewards for referring friends and sharing on social media -- a clever driver of growth. In some games you click, in some you swipe, and in some you make some cheeky choices.  Take Hamster Kombat, a deeply self-aware game with b-side references to Web3 culture. You act as the CEO of a crypto exchange that needs to make decisions on marketing, PR, and even legal considerations; unlocking the perk of “SEC Transparency,” for example, can boost your profit-per-hour, as can implementing KYC or obtaining a license to operate in the UAE. (In a sense, this is an extremely weird game to onboard normies. It’s hard to visualize Iranian taxi drivers obsessing about SEC transparency.)  While it seems that TON games dropped from the sky just weeks ago, many have been in development for years. (This echoes 2021’s Summer of NFTs, where insiders had been following the trend since 2017’s CryptoPunks.) Wong says that Catizen began eyeing Telegram in 2021.  Consider this bold prediction from January 2023: “TON will become the biggest blockchain in terms of the # of users, thanks to 1) its technology and 2) Telegram. It’s only a matter of time,” wrote Sasha, the founder of Notcoin, in a prescient twitter thread. “Telegram has 700M MAU and is the main messenger for the crypto people. Telegram’s founders invented TON and have integrated blockchain to sell Telegram usernames and anonymous numbers (NFT). They announced non-custodial wallets and DEXs a month ago.”  This is precisely what happened. That said, a sprawling network and a slick interface can only explain so much. TON games also offer something else: The allure of making money.  The millions of Notcoin users, after tapping and tapping and earning coins, were delighted to receive an Airdrop that showered 80 billion Not tokens to the community, transforming their mindless clicking into something with real value (at least for now). “Notcoin, a Mini App on Telegram, reached 35 million active users in just a few months,” Pavel Durov, Telegram’s CEO, wrote in his Telegram channel. “All of a sudden, Notcoin users who just played this game for fun could convert their in-game currency into real money.” (Telegram has officially distanced itself from TON after regulatory skirmishes with the SEC.)  Notcoin set the precedent, so now millions of users click on other games in anticipation of future rewards. Play-to-Airdrop is the new Play-to-Earn. This is not subtle; Catizen’s official tagline is even “Play to Airdrop.”  It’s hard to find any growth in the Web3 space that’s not somehow pegged to price appreciation, and GameFi is no exception. “I would attribute most of its success in recent months, including price, to the good old-fashioned speculation we’re used to,” says Zimmerman. He’s also skeptical of the reported number of users, as human beings can have multiple wallets. But even if you discount the numbers, Zimmerman acknowledges there are “real fundamentals here.”  These fundaments are catching the eyes of other game developers. “I’m pretty bullish on TON games,” says Des Dickerson, CEO of THNDR, which is building bitcoin-powered games on the Lightning network. (Dickerson has leaned into mobile crypto gaming since before it was cool; here’s my deep-dive into her project from 2021.) “This trend is proof that users want gaming weaved into their social interactions,” she says, “and they want these games to have real-world value baked into the gameplay.”  But there is one possible catch to all of this. (In crypto, there’s always a catch.) Rightly or wrongly, two words will act as a splash of cold water for any “earn free money!” crypto game that seems too good to be true: Axie Infinity. Axie was the darling of the last crypto gaming hype cycle; it’s now widely seen as a cautionary tale. So how are TON games different?  For starters, Wong says that Axie had a “high entry barrier to play the game, and the entry ticket becomes more and more expensive.” He has a point. The cheapest Axies were over $300 at their peak, and the price would go up as long as there are more new users coming in than users dipping out. That’s not sustainable. Wong says, “It’s not very far from a Ponzi scheme.” Catizen and the other TON games, in contrast, require no upfront investment.  Kardan gets the “How is this not Axie?” question all the time. “The answer is quite simple,” he says. “All of these games are about traffic,” explaining that the Airdrops are essentially marketing campaigns to get users and traffic, and that traffic can be monetized. “This is all about selling traffic,” he says, so there’s an “inflow of money from advertisers.”  Zimmerman isn’t so sure. “If we’re being honest, we all know that stuff [games like Hamster Kombat] is not going to be sustainable,” he says. “If you want your network to be truly successful, you need to have some apps that are profitable.” He thinks it’s quite possible that TON is near one of the “big tops,” as in the top of the market cycle (foreshadowing a crash), and suspects the real test will be what happens after a “cataclysmic wipeout.” He also thinks TON could survive and even thrive. “With the real advantage they have in UX and distribution,” says Zimmerman, “We’ve never seen that in crypto before.”  Maybe this growth is sustainable, maybe it’s not. But the growth itself is undeniable and it matters -- just ask the Iranian military.",POSITIVE,TON,AXS | REGULATION | TRADING | NOT | TON,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/07/08/what-hamster-kombat-did-how-telegram-built-a-web3-gaming-juggernaut,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2496b114095de158e5f810af748e3b5d8b108f61-1085x630.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

If Bitcoin loses support near current levels, it could move back into the 30,000-50,000 USD range. Past halving cycles suggest Bitcoin should perform well over the next 12 months, but a sustained upward move will require a supportive macro backdrop and increased demand. I believe a sustained bull market will likely require a recession followed by a loosening of monetary policy. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has trended down in recent weeks and is at risk of losing support. As an asset exhibiting a high degree of momentum, I think there is still significant downside risk from current levels. While only fairly modest in magnitude, Bitcoin's recent decline places it a crossroad as further declines could see it move back into the 30,000-50,000 USD range. The pullback could be considered surprising given the strength of equity markets and the support that ETF flows and the halving are potentially providing. Bitcoin is possibly being negatively impacted by liquidity though and may also be a canary in the coal mine for risk assets given mounting macro weakness. The economy appears to be slowly moving towards a recession, which I believe would be extremely negative for Bitcoin, at least initially, before central banks begin to flood the market with liquidity. Halving Bitcoin’s price action in the lead up to the most recent halving has been in line with previous halvings. Based on past events, the expectation would be that in the next 6 months Bitcoin’s price begins to increase sharply, moving towards approximately 200,000 USD. The halving cannot be viewed in isolation though and I don’t believe a small change to new supply can affect this type of change. I tend to think if halvings have any real impact, it involves catalyzing an increase in demand, which results in a positive feedback loop between price and demand. Figure 1: Bitcoin Price Around Halvings (source: Created by author using data from Yahoo Finance) Internet search data doesn’t suggest that this type of behavior is occurring at the moment. If anything, demand already appears to have peaked, meaning that Bitcoin’s price may have further to fall. Figure 2: ""Bitcoin"" Search Interest (source: Created by author using data from Google Trends and Yahoo Finance) ETF Flows The launch of Bitcoin ETFs has probably opened up demand somewhat, with ETF flows an important driver of price at the moment. ETF inflows have fallen off in recent weeks, but Bitcoin’s price appears to have led this move. Figure 3: Bitcoin ETF Flows (source: Created by author using data from Yahoo Finance) Financial Conditions Monetary policy is also an important determinant of Bitcoin’s price, although the relationship is non-linear and dynamic. While the flood of liquidity at the start of the pandemic was probably an important driver of Bitcoin’s price run in late 2020 and early 2021, there appears to be little relationship at the moment. If the Fed continues to drain liquidity from the system, this will likely begin to have a negative impact on Bitcoin at some point. Figure 4: Central Bank Liquidity (source: Created by author using data from the Federal Reserve and Yahoo Finance) Bitcoin’s recent price run also appears abnormal in light of current interest rates. Bitcoin’s price hasn’t exhibited a strong relationship with interest rates in the past. Past bull runs may have been initiated by real rates falling below zero though, ending when real rates moved towards positive territory again. From a theoretical perspective, higher rates increase the opportunity cost of money and should make Bitcoin less appealing. Figure 5: Fed Funds Rate (source: Created by author using data from the Federal Reserve and Yahoo Finance) A sustained Bitcoin bull market requires loose financial conditions and euphoric markets. The Fed's National Financial Conditions index suggests loose conditions, but this is more an indicator of stress in financial markets than monetary policy. Monetary policy is reasonably tight at the moment even though there is little stress in most markets. This could rapidly change if economic conditions deteriorate though. Figure 6: Financial Conditions Index (Source: Created by author using data from The Federal Reserve and Yahoo Finance) Bitcoin is a risk on asset, and it is this perspective that provides the most insight into Bitcoin's returns in recent years. The question at this point is whether the Bitcoin bull run is over and is leading equity markets, or whether Bitcoin will bounce back and continue moving up alongside equities Figure 7: Nasdaq 100 Index (source: Created by author using data from Yahoo Finance) While equity markets are currently quite strong, it should be noted that there is little breadth. Some of this is the result of fundamentals but the valuations of many large cap stocks (particularly tech stocks) have become frothy. This can be seen from the performance of the S&P500 index versus an equal weight equivalent. The current extreme outperformance by large caps is typically only seen during large drawdowns. Economic conditions are deteriorating, and many businesses are struggling at the moment. This situation will not persist indefinitely. Either business conditions will improve, along with breadth in equity markets, or many large cap stocks will correct significantly. Figure 8: S&P 500 / S&P 500 Equal Weight Index Ratio (source: Created by author using data from Yahoo Finance) Conclusion Based on past halving cycles, Bitcoin should be expected to perform well over the next 12 months. A sustained upward move from current levels will require a supportive macro backdrop and a positive feedback loop between price and demand though, neither of which appears likely at the moment. A recession followed by loose monetary policy is the most likely path to a sustained Bitcoin bull market. This would probably involve a significant price decline before Bitcoin rebounds though. The risk to a post-recession rebound would be if inflation remains elevated. In this case, the policy response may be weighted towards fiscal stimulus, which would not be as beneficial for Bitcoin",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702908-bitcoin-crossroad-with-negatively-skewed-risk-reward-ratio?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/30641119.jpeg

42417765,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZtdN,1720441417,First Mover Americas: BTC Rebounds to $57K,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  During the European morning, bitcoin recovered from a slump that had seen it sink to just above $54,000.BTC subsequently recovered to climb above $58,000 and is currently trading at around $57,200, down about 0.4% in the last 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index meanwhile has climbed 0.33, after also crashing during the Asian morning. Data from CoinGlass shows there have been $175 million in long liquidations over the last 24 hours after bitcoin lost 13% last week, a decline comparable to that it experienced in the aftermath of FTX's collapse.  Germany's bitcoin sales and Mt. Gox's reimbursements have recently shaken up the crypto market, and the drama may not be over yet. The eurozone's biggest economy still holds 39,826 BTC worth $2.2 billion, according to data tracked by Arkham Intelligence. The stash, a potential source of selling pressure, represents nearly 9% of BTC's 24-hour trading volume of $25.3 billion, suggesting further price turbulence. Early this year, the German Federal Criminal Police Office seized 49,857 BTC from the operators of Movie2k.to, a privacy website that was last active in 2013. Since mid-June, the government has liquidated over 10,000 BTC, putting downward pressure on the cryptocurrency's going market rate.  Bitcoin mining was more profitable in June than May as the price of the cryptocurrency rose 2% and the network hashrate dropped by 5%, and as the market adjusted to the effects of the halving, investment bank Jefferies said in a research report on Monday. “June was a month of modest recovery from the immediate impacts of the halving that were most pronounced in May,” analyst Jonathan Petersen wrote. Hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain and is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty. The quadrennial reward halving, which occurred in April, slowed the rate of growth in bitcoin supply as miners' rewards were cut by 50%.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows a timezone-wise break up of BTC's 17% slide in four weeks.  Asian session accounts for most losses, suggesting that ""many retail traders in Asia have been liquidated,"" according to 10x Research.

42417762,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZtYD,1720440352,"Bitcoin Climbs Over $57K, With Some Saying Mt. Gox Sales Already ‘Priced In’","Bitcoin reversed a 4% loss to regain the $57,000 mark, with Ether surpassing $3,000.  The market is shifting focus from Mt. Gox's repayments to U.S. Federal Reserve policies, with traders eyeing economic data releases and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony later this week.  Bitcoin reversed a 4% loss from the Asian trading session to regain the $57,000 mark in European morning hours Monday as some majors rose as much as 3%.  Ether {{ET}} jumped back over $3,000 after losing the level on Friday, while Cardano’s {{ADA}} led gains with a 3.3% rise over the past 24 hours. Solana’s SOL, BNB Chain’s BNB and dogecoin (DOGE) were up at least 1%.  Celestia’s TIA led gains among tokens with a market capitalization between $1 billion and $5 billion, jumping 15% ahead of its flagship Modular Summit conference scheduled for Thursday.  The broad-based CoinDesk 20, an index of the largest tokens, edged higher, reversing a 7% loss from earlier in the day.  Meanwhile, BTC traders are back to tracking U.S. Federal Reserve speeches and policies as the market has largely priced in the impact of defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox’s repayments.  BTC saw one of its steepest falls last week as prices fell more than 8% in the span of a few hours on Friday, falling to as low as $53,600 shortly after Mt. Gox started moving millions worth of the token to the Japan-based bitBank exchange. The exchange’s trading desk, however, told CoinDesk in a Monday email that they expect lesser market impact from Mt. Gox’s wallet movements ahead.  “Bitcoin was already fluctuating around $54,000 by the time Mt.Gox’s trustee officially announced that they had commenced repayment,” Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at bitBank, said. “The price bounced back after the announcement and briefly recovered $58,000 during the weekend.”  “The market had overly priced in the repayment before it actually started, and later reacted to the (U.S.) jobs report on Friday, which was announced after the beginning of Mt.Gox’s repayment,"" Hasegawa added. ""This suggests that the market’s concern for Mt.Gox’s repayment is starting to wane and their focus is shifting back to the Fed’s policy decisions.""  The latest U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report is scheduled for Thursday. In addition, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell will testify to Congress Tuesday and Wednesday, possibly providing clues as to whether the central bank intends to ease monetary policy in coming months.  That aside, some market observers expect dim price action to continue, citing the summer holiday months.  “It’s a case of more summer blues for investors,” shared Philippe Bekhazi, CEO and co-founder of digital asset services firm XBTO, in an email. “The bottom line is sellers are more motivated than buyers right now. Lots of people are on holiday, many small miners are shutting down and long-term holders are trimming their positions.”  “However, the key thing here is that this pattern is not really any different to what we normally see following the months after a bitcoin halving event,” continued Bekhazi, referring to the seasonality commonly observed in bitcoin market cycles.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/08/bitcoin-climbs-over-57k-with-some-saying-mt-gox-sales-already-priced-in,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/be5c7ec55ff38e743458bda70ce1e81183e53d19-5981x3364.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

30638361,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628368,1720438216,Dogecoin Price Decline Looms As Bears Cut Short Recovery: Key Levels To Watch,"Dogecoin’s recent recovery has been abruptly halted by renewed bearish pressure, paving the way for a potential further decline. After attempting a rebound, the bears have regained control of the market, pushing DOGE back toward its previous low of $0.0914. As the crypto asset’s price moves towards this level, speculations are whether it will break or experience a rejection and begin to move upward. This article delves into providing an analysis of Dogecoin’s recent price action to identify and examine key support and resistance levels that traders and investors should watch to understand the potential direction of DOGE’s movement. At the time of writing, DOGE’s price was down by over 5.13%%, trading at about $0.1043, with a market capitalization of more than $15 billion and a trading volume of more than $787 million. In the last 24 hours, the market capitalization of SOL has decreased by 5.22%, while trading volume has increased by 4.26%. Overview Of DOGE’s Recent Price Action Analyzing the recent movements and trends in DOGE’s price reveals that: On the 4-hour chart, the crypto asset is actively bearish and trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). DOGE’s price has been consistently bearish since after the disruption of its recovering move at $0.1069 and is currently attempting a move towards its previous low of $0.0914. Also, with the formation of the 4-hour William alligator, although Dogecoin is currently rising, there is a possibility that it may begin to drop again as both the alligator lip and teeth are presently trending below the alligator jaw. On the 4-hour chart, it can be observed that the price of DOGE is still bearish as it is still trading below the 100-day SMA. Even though the price is attempting a short-term pullback by dropping a bullish candlestick, the crypto asset may extend its bullishness in the long run. Additionally, the 4-hour William alligator indicates more bearishness for the crypto asset as both the alligator lip and teeth are actively trending below the jaw. Key Support Levels To Monitor For Dogecoin Presently, DOGE is attempting a downward move toward its previous low of $0,0914. If the asset’s price reaches this level and closes below, it will continue to move downward to test the $0.0745 support level and probably head on to test the $0.0559 support level and other higher levels if the $0.0745 support is breached.

BTC miners serve as beta play on Bitcoin's move, similar to gold mining industry. Miners well positioned to profit from AI infrastructure build-out, potential for high-margin revenue and partnerships with hyperscalers. Ironically enough, on Halloween 2023, I ended a long hiatus from SA and posted my thesis on Bitcoin miners, with special attention focused on the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF ( WGMI ). At the time of the article, WGMI was trading at under $10 a share with little to no momentum. Fortunately, those who were brave enough to take the plunge have been rewarded with an outsized gain of over 100%, with the potential for more to come. A few notable recent events, in my view, warrant a reexamination of the thesis to determine if the opportunity has passed or if there are more gains to come. Bitcoin The initial foray into the miners was based on the premise that the miners would serve as a beta play on the continued higher move of the underlying asset, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). I viewed the BTC miners in a similar vein to the gold mining industry. The theory held that when the gold ( GLD ) ran, the miners witnessed by the VanEck Gold Miners ETF ( GDX ) would outpace the underlying move in the commodity as miner profitability would explode higher. The BTC/ WGMI thesis has held up remarkably well. On October 31st, BTC traded at $33k, and WGMI traded at roughly $10. BTC is up roughly 75%, while WGMI is up over 120% in the comparable period. An interesting anomaly has opened, with BTC peaking in mid-March, yet the gains in WGMI have accelerated since. Halving Cycle BTC underwent its pre-determined halving every 210k blocks on April 19, 2024. The halving vent is notable for two main reasons. For the miners, it is a period of expected pain as the block reward for mining is cut in half. The reduction in block rewards sets off a chain reaction where miners are required to upgrade equipment or face the risk of obsolescence as block rewards fail to cover the cost of energy. At the time of the halving, the BTC network hash rate was 650 Ehs, a notable peak. The current hash rate of 546 Ehs is a drop of 16%, and more hash rates could come offline as the current hash reward approaches 4.5 cents per Terahash. We do not see revenue and earnings explode higher as miners face a tough go post-halving. We have a change in the thesis as a new element that can boost the miner's revenue has been uncovered. AI Winner The miners and, by extension, WGMI are well positioned to profit from the ongoing build-out of AI infrastructure. Some may postulate this is a bridge too far, yet I can assure you it is not. What does a BTC miner do? They identify cheap, underutilized power sources, typically in remote areas, to build a data center to set up their machines to mine Bitcoin. Miners typically avoid major city centers as the cost of electricity is prohibitive. For example, my home electricity rate is thirteen cents a kWh. If I plug in a 100Ths machine, I can expect to earn $4.55 in BTC rewards (if I can stand the noise and do not get fined for noise ordinance). The cost of mining is $9.55, leaving me with a net loss every day. To make a go of it, a miner would need to procure long-term electricity contracts at 2-3 cents a kilowatt hour. Coincidentally, the AI build-out requires the same conditions as those witnessed by the hyperscalers, who need to acquire abundant energy quickly. We witnessed the opening gambit of a multi-year bull market in energy, with Amazon ( AMZN ) acquiring a nuclear power plant to power a data center currently under construction. AMZN dropped $650 million for the plant, who's to say another competitor with a deep pocket will not step forth and acquire a publicly traded BTC miner? The probable path of least resistance for the miners is to partner with the hyperscalers and offer to manage some of their AI workload at the existing BTC mining facilities. The customer can forgo the cost of building the facility from scratch. In contrast, the miners can now have a new source of high-margin revenue that will offset some of the volatility of the BTC mining industry. An example is the recently announced deal by HUT8 ( HUT ), a BTC mining veteran. I believe the AI buildout and the recently announced deals are what arrested the anticipated slide in WGMI due to the recent peak in BTC prices. WGMI Holdings In my view, the optimal setup is to purchase the index instead of one of two names in the industry. The AI deals signed by some of the smaller cap miners have come out of the blue, whereas the largest player by market cap, Marathon Digital (MARA), is down for the year as the AI potential seems to have passed them by. WGMI has astutely under-indexed them, with MARA the seventh-largest holding. I suggest readers familiarize themselves with the current top holdings vs. my last article to see the dynamism of the industry. Risk Factors WGMI earnings are currently tied to the vagaries of the BTC cycle. With the recent drop in the price of BTC due to Mt Gox repayments, there are no guarantees the miners will continue to outperform. In addition, an investor is buying into an ETF that is red-hot and potentially overbought. A nasty pullback can occur at any time, inflicting psychological pain and potential losses. In addition, the AI buildout may hit speed bumps, with little guarantee that additional hosting deals will be signed. Failure to ink additional deals may have a hard-to-predict material adverse effect on the industry. With a sharp eye on the potential and a keen awareness of the risk involved, I thank all for reading and good luck!!!",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702890-wgmi-revisiting-my-bullish-thesis-on-the-bitcoin-miners?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/30636613.jpeg

42417769,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZtgT,1720434367,Ether Retakes $3K Amid Signs of Seller Exhaustion Before ETF Debut,"Ether rose past $3,000 during European trading hours.  Discounts in the Grayscale Ethereum Trust and the Coinbase indicator have evaporated.  Price charts show seller exhaustion near the long-held support at $2,800.  After falling nearly 20% in the four weeks to July 5, the ether {{ETH}} market finally shows signs of seller exhaustion and a potential bullish turnaround.  Early Monday, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain rose over 4% to $3,050, bouncing off crucial support, according to CoinDesk data.  The recovery, coupled with other indicators gauging demand and investment sentiment, suggests the cryptocurrency may have bottomed out ahead of the impending debut of spot ether ETFs in the U.S. this month.  Let's discuss those in detail.  Coinbase and Grayscale discounts evaporate  Ether is no longer trading at a discount on the Nasdaq-listed Coinbase compared to Binance, a sign of seller exhaustion and potential price bottom.  Blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant's ether premium index, which measures the gap between Coinbase's ETH/USD pair and Binance's ETH/USDT pair, has bounced to zero or neutral from the deep discount of -0.19 at the end of June. The erstwhile discount represented strong selling pressure from the stateside investors.  Similarly, the discount to net asset value (NAV) for the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) has silently evaporated for the first time in over two years in a sign of increased investor confidence and demand for ether-related investments, according to data source Grayscale and YCharts.  ""The discount had been narrowing since the crypto bear market bottom in December 2022 and, in particular, more recently with the SEC's approval of 19b-4 forms for spot Ethereum ETFs from various issuers on May 23, 2024,"" Tagus Capital said in an email.  Although the issuers still need to have their S-1 registration statements become effective before trading can start, the elimination of the NAV discount indicates expectations of impending SEC approval for Ethereum ETF trading, potentially around mid-July,"" Tagus Capital added.  According to several observers, the ETFs will likely unlock billions in investor demand for ether and boost awareness of its parent blockchain, Ethereum, which is usually considered more complicated than Bitcoin.  ""Analysts have predicted that the potential demand for the ETH ETF will result in inflows around 30% of those experienced during the BTC ETF introduction. During the first five months, the BTC ETF experienced $5 billion in net inflows,"" analysts at IntoTheBlock said in the weekly newsletter.  Sellers fail to penetrate key support  Price recoveries are typical during bearish trends, but ether's move above $3,000 stands out because it has followed a successful defense of crucial support zone of $2,800-$2,850.  Buyers defended those levels through the second half of April and early May, establishing it as crucial support. The fact that long-tailed daily candles have emerged at the said support since Friday suggests sellers have run out of steam.  A long-tailed candle shows that sellers were initially in control, driving the price down to the support, but were eventually overpowered by buyers. Hence, potential exists that the recovery will keep going in the near future.  Another sign of reassurance for the bulls is the presence of the double bottom pattern on the hourly chart. The pattern found at the end of a downtrend, resembling the letter ""W,"" indicates decreased selling momentum and a potential bullish turnaround. The fact that prices have tested and found support at the same level twice suggests sellers are struggling.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/08/ether-retakes-3k-amid-signs-of-seller-exhaustion-before-etf-debut,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/484ffefeb12a3fd1ce87040fbf60e13973ef50d4-1687x1132.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

30633696,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628340,1720431311,Will The DOT Rise? Polkadot Price Anticipation Heats Up With ETF Talk,"The winds of change might be blowing for Polkadot (DOT), a popular blockchain network for connecting different blockchains. After a rough couple of months marked by a nearly 50% price decline from its April peak, DOT is exhibiting signs of a potential resurgence. This positive outlook stems from a confluence of three key factors: whispers of a DOT-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Coinbase, a bullish technical chart pattern, and healthy levels of liquidity in the market. Related Reading: $2.4 Billion Worth Of Bitcoin Exit The Network As Bear Market Bites ETF Buzz Ignites Investor Interest News broke earlier this week that crypto researcher 0xNoble revealed on a social media platform that Coinbase might be harboring secret plans for a DOT ETF. The rumor suggests the cryptocurrency exchange is in the initial stages of applying for the ETF, with the first approval hurdle anticipated on July 15th. This news comes on the heels of Coinbase’s significant move on June 28th, where they filed applications for DOT Futures Contracts, a Futures ETF, and a Spot ETF. Coinbase is secretly applying for $DOT ETF 🔥 The first stage of approval is already scheduled for July 15! Polkadot ETF will be incredibly bullish for the entire ecosystem👇🧵 pic.twitter.com/OF8CrJxp2m — 0xNobler (@CryptoNobler) July 4, 2024 The prospect of a DOT ETF has generated excitement within the Polkadot community. Exchange-traded funds, which trade like stocks on traditional exchanges, can introduce a new wave of investors to the cryptocurrency space. This broader exposure often translates to increased buying pressure and potentially higher prices for the underlying asset. Notably, the ETF announcement has already triggered a surge in activity on Coinbase Derivatives, a testament to the pent-up investor interest. Polkadot: Technical Analysis Hints At Price Breakout Adding fuel to the DOT rally fire is a recent technical analysis by ZAYK Charts, a well-respected cryptocurrency research firm. Their analysis of DOT’s one-day chart revealed a compelling pattern known as a falling wedge. This pattern is characterized by converging trendlines that slope downwards, encapsulating lower highs and lower lows. While traditionally viewed as a bearish pattern, falling wedges can also indicate a potential bullish reversal. According to ZAYK Charts, the falling wedge suggests that while sellers have been in control recently, their influence is waning. This is further evidenced by Polkadot oscillating within this pattern since February. The lower trendline has consistently provided support, while the upper trendline has acted as resistance. ZAYK anticipates a breakout from this wedge, which typically leads to a significant upward price movement. Their breakout target sits around $9.60, representing a potential gain of over 50% from the current price level. $DOT Still Moving Inside the Falling Wedge,In 1D Timeframe✅ Expecting Breakout📈#DOT #DOTUSDT #Polkadot #Crypto pic.twitter.com/19eQ0cPBwR — ZAYK Charts (@ZAYKCharts) July 7, 2024 The analyst highlights this target zone as a green box on the chart. The timing of this breakout is crucial – as DOT continues to trade within the narrowing wedge, pressure builds, making a breakout more likely in the near future. Related Reading: XRP Stages A Comeback: Aims To Reclaim $0.50 After Recent Plunge Ample Liquidity Could Amplify Potential Surge Adding another layer of intrigue to the DOT rally narrative is the presence of significant liquidity. A heatmap analysis by NewsBTC revealed concentrated liquidity zones for DOT between $6.45 and $6.96. Liquidity refers to the ease with which an asset can be bought or sold. High liquidity translates to smoother price movements, as large buy or sell orders are less likely to cause significant price swings. The presence of high liquidity between $6.45 and $6.96 creates a more favorable environment for a potential breakout. This abundance of buy and sell orders can act as a buffer, absorbing selling pressure and preventing sharp price drops. If a breakout from the falling wedge occurs, this liquidity could help propel DOT’s price towards the $9.60 target zone identified by ZAYK Charts.

42417755,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZtV7,1720429614,Bitcoin Mining Profitability Rose in June as Market Adjusted for the Halving: Jefferies,"Bitcoin mining was more profitable in June than May, the report said.  Jefferies cut its Marathon Digital price target to $22 from $24.  The bank also reduced its price target for Argo Blockchain ADRs to $1.20 from $1.50 and for the U.K.-traded stock to 9.5p from 11.9p.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} mining was more profitable in June than May as the price of the cryptocurrency rose 2% and the network hashrate dropped by 5%, and as the market adjusted to the effects of the halving, investment bank Jefferies said in a research report on Monday.  “June was a month of modest recovery from the immediate impacts of the halving that were most pronounced in May,” analyst Jonathan Petersen wrote.  Hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain and is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty. The quadrennial reward halving, which occurred in April, slowed the rate of growth in bitcoin supply as miners' rewards were cut by 50%.  Jefferies cut its price target for hold-rated Marathon Digital (MARA) to $22 from $24. The bank also reduced its price target on Argo Blockchain ADRs (ARBK) to $1.20 from $1.50 and on the U.K. traded shares (ARB) to 9.5p (12 cents) from 11.90p. It maintained its hold rating on the company. One ADR is equivalent to 10 shares.  The bank noted that a number of bitcoin miners have pivoted towards to high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) hosting to diversify their revenue and capitalize on surging demand for AI and cloud computing infrastructure.  “This strategic shift has been driven by the declining profitability of bitcoin mining, particularly after the recent halving events,” Petersen wrote.  U.S.-listed mining companies produced a greater share of new bitcoin in June than May, the bank said, increasing to 20.8% of the total network versus 19.1% the month before as they brought on new capacity and the network hashrate dropped.  Marathon mined the most bitcoin in June, 590, though that was 4% fewer than in May. CleanSpark (CLSK) mined 445 tokens, an increase of 7%, the report said. Marathon’s installed hashrate remained the largest of the U.S. listed miners, at 31.5 exahashes per second (EH/S) with Riot Platforms (RIOT) second with 22 EH/s, the report added.

President Emmanuel Macron's Ensemble won 161 seats, while Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally secured 141.  The lack of an outright majority could make forming new policy, including crypto regulations, harder, said Mark Foster, the EU policy lead at the Crypto Council for Innovation.  France's general election unexpectedly saw a left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, win the most seats on Sunday, but the group fell short of a majority in the National Assembly contest, leading to a hung parliament that could make forming any new policy, including crypto regulations, harder.  The coalition won 188 seats – 289 are needed for a majority – while President Emmanuel Macron's centrist Ensemble coalition now has 161 seats. National Rally (RN), the far-right party associated with Marine Le Pen, came third with 141 seats according to Politico data.  After the results came out France's Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who is from the Renaissance party, said he would hand in his resignation to Macron but the French president asked him to stay in the role.  ""The President has asked Gabriel Attal to remain prime minister for the time being in order to ensure the country's stability,"" Macron's office said in a statement, Reuters reported. CoinDesk also reached out for comment.  Politicians from several parties including Macron's Renaissance party began strategically cooperating after the first round of voting last week resulted in the right wingers securing the largest share of the vote. Third-placed candidates withdrew from the race in an attempt to prevent the anti-RN vote being split.  The result is likely going to make passing legislation, including new crypto regulations, much more difficult, Mark Foster, the EU policy lead at the Crypto Council for Innovation, told CoinDesk in an earlier statement.  ""It looks like the new parliament will have much larger far-left and far-right contingents, making domestic policy development (including on crypto/digital assets) uncertain and difficult whilst limiting the president’s authority on international and European stages,"" Foster said after the first round of voting on June 30.  France has already taken significant strides with crypto. Last year, it registered 74 crypto companies, a number that was expected to jump to 100, and regulators have since been trying to attract more digital asset businesses.  Regulators started enforcing the European Union's wide-ranging crypto asset legislation, the Markets in Crypto Asset (MiCA) rules on stablecoins, at the end of June. The rest of the crypto rules are due to go live by the end of the year.

30630065,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628330,1720425926,Is Bitcoin Undervalued Now? Industry Expert Decodes The Market State,"On Saturday, Bitcoin experienced a robust rally, climbing above $58,250. Despite this upward movement, it was unable to sustain the momentum and close above the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). This led to the formation of a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern on Sunday, signaling potential downside momentum. Currently, Bitcoin is trading below $56,000, positioning it at a critical juncture in terms of technical analysis and market sentiment. Sina G, the COO and co-founder of 21st Capital, provided a breakdown of the factors influencing Bitcoin’s price trajectory today, particularly highlighting recent declines and evaluating its undervalued state through sophisticated metrics. Starting with a historical overview, Sina pointed out that Bitcoin had seen a drastic 26% decline from a March peak of $73,000, settling around $56,000 in recent weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Critic Calls ‘Institutional Demand’ A Myth Following Recent Price Slump This sharp decrease has been attributed to several macroeconomic and sector-specific factors. According to him, Bitcoin’s fall from the $73,000 peak in March to $56,000 aligns with historical bull market corrections, which often see significant yet temporary retracements. The influence of Bitcoin ETFs has been pivotal. Initially, these ETFs contributed significantly to the price surge from $16,000 to $73,000, as investors engaged heavily in a buy-the-rumor, buy-the-news strategy. “Up to mid-march ETF flows were very strong and the market moved up. Since then ETFs slowed down and bankruptcy outflows took over, causing a weak price action all the way down to $56K. A notable recent impact on Bitcoin’s price has been the selling activity of the German government, which disposed of Bitcoin seized in 2013 from the pirated content platform Movie2k.to. “The government’s decision to liquidate approximately 10,000 coins across three transactions coincided directly with significant price drops on specific dates in June and July,” he noted. This selloff contributed to a steep 24% crash in June and July, exacerbated by the large volume of Bitcoin introduced into the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crashes Below $54,000: Top-5 Reasons Is Bitcoin Undervalued? To address whether Bitcoin is currently undervalued, Sina turned to the Volatility-Adjusted Price Level Index (VPLI), a proprietary metric developed by 21st Capital. “Currently, our VPLI is at -3.57, which indicates that Bitcoin is significantly below its fair price,” Sina stated. He further clarified that historically, a VPLI score of -10 corresponds with bear market bottoms, placing the current reading in a context that suggests Bitcoin is potentially undervalued. “This puts us in the 41th percentile of values – i.e., Bitcoin has only spent 41% of below this VPLI reading (most of which during the bear markets). So the risk-reward balance is favorable,” he added. Looking forward, Sina highlighted two critical short-term indicators that could dictate Bitcoin’s immediate price movements: the continuation of Bitcoin sales by the German government and the behavior of the perpetual swaps funding rate. “Recently, the funding rate has been negative, which is typically a bearish signal. This suggests that many traders are taking short positions, anticipating further declines, which paradoxically might indicate that the market is close to reaching a bottom,” he concluded. At press time, BTC traded at $55,835.

42417784,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZva9,1720424962,Ethereum ICO-Era Stalwart Golem Sent $100M Ether to Exchanges in the Past Month,"Golem, an Ethereum-based project, has transferred over $100 million worth of ether (ETH) to exchanges in the past month, potentially increasing selling pressure in the market.  Golem raised millions of dollars during the 2016 ICO boom and has seen its token value decline significantly from its all-time high, despite ongoing development efforts in AI tools.  Golem, one of the earliest Ethereum initial coin offerings (ICOs), has sent over $100 million worth of ether {{ETH}} to exchanges in the past month, possibly adding selling pressure to the market.  ICOs were a popular way to raise funds to build cryptocurrency projects, with billions of dollars raised from 2016 to 2019. These lost charm among investors in the following years, however, amid regulatory tussles and a general lack of demand.  Data tracked by Arkham shows that Golem’s main wallet has transferred millions of ETH to other wallets, which were later sent to exchanges such as Binance, Bitfinex, Coinbase, and others. Most of these transactions are below $10 million in value and are sent daily.  Independent journalist Colin Wu first reported on Golem’s wallet movements. Golem’s X account did not immediately respond to requests for comment, and the project has not publicly revealed any major upcoming product releases on its X account.  Golem is working on artificial intelligence (AI) based tools as the sector gains interest among traders, as per a roadmap spotlight released in May.  Transactions to crypto exchanges usually imply an intention to sell holdings, as large amounts of tokens are usually not held on an exchange service for a long time for security reasons.  Golem raised over $8.7 million worth of ETH in 2016, becoming one of the biggest benefactors of the ICO frenzy in those years as its decentralized computing narrative did the rounds on social media sites. It positioned itself as a marketplace for computing power, where users can rent out their unused computational resources in return for Golem’s GLM tokens.  But popularity has waned since: Golem currently trades at just 30 cents with a market cap of $300 million, down from an all-time high of $1.32 in January 2018.",NEGATIVE,ETH,ETH | EXCHANGE | BNB | ARKM | TOKEN SALE,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/08/ethereum-ico-era-stalwart-golem-sent-100m-ether-to-exchanges-in-the-past-month,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ec42862086a9b35e22a6a2f7d9aad390d8948435-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The potential selling pressure equates to 5% of bitcoin's 24-hour trading volume.  Germany has been running down its coin stash since mid-June.  Germany's bitcoin {{BTC}} sales and Mt. Gox's reimbursements have recently shaken up the crypto market, and the drama may not be over yet.  The Eurozone's biggest economy still holds 23,800 BTC worth $1.3 billion, according to data tracked by Arkham Intelligence. The pending coin stash, a potential selling pressure, represents nearly 5% of BTC's 24-hour trading volume of $25.3 billion, suggesting further price turbulence.  Early this year, the German Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) seized 49,857 BTC from the operators of Movie2k.to, a privacy website that was last active in 2013. Since mid-June, the government has liquidated over 10,000 BTC, putting downward pressure on the cryptocurrency's going market rate. It transferred an additional chunk of its holdings today.  BTC's spot price has declined by nearly 20% to $55,490 in four weeks, with prices slipping nearly 13% in the past seven days alone, according to CoinDesk data. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a broader market gauge, has dropped nearly 14% to 1,870 points in one week.  Last week, Tron founder Justin Sun offered to purchase BTC from the German government off-market to reduce the negative impact on the spot price.  Per some observers, Germany's BTC sales amount to a strategic blunder that puts the country at a disadvantage in geopolitical terms.  ""Foolishly, the German Government has transferred more than $390 million worth of BTC to exchanges over the past few weeks to be sold for fiat currency.

DOGE is consolidating and might extend losses below $0.100. DOGE price is struggling to clear the $0.1150 resistance zone. The price is trading below the $0.1080 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.1050 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price must settle above $0.1080 and $0.1150 to gain bullish momentum. Dogecoin Price Takes Hit After a decent recovery wave, Dogecoin price remained below the $0.1150 resistance zone. DOGE formed a high near $0.1141 and recently started a fresh decline like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move below the $0.1080 support level. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.09134 swing low to the $0.1141 high. However, the bulls are now active near the $0.100 zone. Dogecoin is now trading below the $0.1080 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. It is also above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.09134 swing low to the $0.1141 high. If there is a fresh increase, the price might face resistance near the $0.1050 level. There is also a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.1050 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. The next major resistance is near the $0.1080 level. A close above the $0.1080 resistance might send the price toward the $0.1150 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.1250 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.1320. More Downsides In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to gain pace above the $0.1150 level, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.100 level. The next major support is near the $0.0950 level. If there is a downside break below the $0.0920 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.0850 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.100, $0.0950 and $0.0850.

BTC has been down 13% in the last week, which puts it in similar territory to the aftermath of the FTX collapse.  Stronger than expected U.S. jobs data, but a rising unemployment rate has penciled in a Fed rate cut for September, according to a recent note by ING.  ING's James Knightley wrote that private sector job growth has been particularly weak, with only 136,000 new jobs added in June, below the 160,000 expected. Government, education, and healthcare services contributed nearly 60% of new jobs, while retail, temporary help, professional business services, and manufacturing all saw job losses.

The price is trading below $56,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $56,350 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).

A close above the $58,40 resistance might start a steady increase and send the price higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $60,000 resistance in the coming sessions.
