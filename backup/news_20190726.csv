42382403,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rasH,1564180244,Prosecutors File Formal Complaint Against Infamous BTC-e Crypto Exchange,"According to a court document filed on July 25 in the Northern District of California, BTC-e and its executive Alexander Vinnik have been indicted for the alleged crimes of conspiracy, money laundering, unlawful monetary transactions, and operating an unlicensed exchange. The now-defunct exchange and Vinnik face civil penalties of $88.6 million and $12 million, plus interest and costs, respectively, amounts initially determined by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) in July 2017.  In all, Vinnik has been indicted for 17 counts of money laundering and two counts of engaging in unlawful monetary transactions. While BTC-e and Vinnik were also charged with one count of operating an unlawful money services business and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.  Brought on behalf of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the action paints a story of a firm’s blatant disregard for the law. The government alleges BTC-e and Vinnik were more than willing to launder and hold funds for some of the most nefarious organizations involved in the cryptocurrency industry, so long as its owners profited.  This includes funds received from the computer 'hack’ that brought down prominent exchange Mt. Gox.  Unlike many legitimate crypto exchanges, the Cyprus and Seychelles-based BTC-e billed itself as an anonymous way to buy, sell, and transact in bitcoin and other digital currencies. Anyone, anywhere was allowed to operate on its platform without “even the most basic identifying information.”  Attorneys David Anderson, Sara Winslow, and Kirsten Ault allege this willfully substandard record keeping “contributed to its customers’ willingness to accept BTC-e’s unfavorable exchange rates compared to other legitimate” exchanges.  Over its 6 year history, BTC-e served approximately 700,000 users who traded over $296 million over more than 21,000 bitcoin transactions, not to mention the other coins. While not all of BTC-e’s clients were criminals, the investigators write:  ""A significant portion of BTC-e’s business was derived from suspected criminal activity.""  Indeed, the firm’s lax approach to collecting user information, hosting of unmonitored open forums where users discussed ways to purchase illicit goods, and refusal to implicate the known criminals on its platform had attracted some of the industry's worst players, and eventually the government’s attention.  Cultivated crime  The firm allegedly cultivated its identity as a safe-haven for the criminal element.  In its chatroom, people “under monikers suggestive of criminality, including user names such as ‘ISIS,’ ‘CocaineCowboys,’ ‘blackhathackers,’ ‘dzkillerhacker,’ and ‘hacker4hire,’” would publicly discuss buying or accessing illicit materials on the dark-web.  Furthermore, the attorneys allege:  “On some occasions, customers contacted BTCe’s administration directly with questions regarding how to process and access proceeds obtained from the sale of illegal drugs and from transactions on known “darknet” illegal markets, including Silk Road.""  At no point did BTC-e ring the alarm, and money kept flowing in.  The attorneys singled out the business relationship forged between BTC-e and Costa Rica-based Liberty Reserve. Allegedly, the firms shared customers and even had a program were “BTC-e code” was redeemable for Liberty’s digital currency.  After Liberty Reserve was shuttered for laundering $6 billion in illicit funds – in an action where U.S. authorities seized the firm’s website and arrested its six principal operators – BTC-e failed to disclose the alliance and smuggled fund’s concealed on its platform.  That case was not an outlier. According to the attorneys, another unregistered and now-shuttered crypto exchange, Coin.MX, performed nearly 1,000 transactions on BTC-e’s platform. Coin.MX, too, was closed on money laundering and conspiracy charges following a Federal investigation. Yet, again, BTC-e failed to disclose this relationship in a Suspicious Activity Report mandated under the Bank Secrecy Act.  While all possible criminal connections cannot be listed here, according to the attorneys the firm harbored funds earned by malicious botnets, scams, and computer hijackings. They took money from identity thieves, and public officials who embezzled funds. And yet, “despite the rampant evidence of illegal activity on its platform, BTC-e did not file a single SAR.”  SAR silence  Instead of speaking out, BTC-e allegedly concealed this sort of illicit activity by instructing their clients to wire money to “front” companies, nominally distinct from the exchange. Furthermore, it is said, BTC-e never recorded or asked for identifying information when receiving wires.  BTC-e would further obscure and anonymize the funds by processing transactions through a layer of temporary addresses called a bitcoin “mixer,” a way to protect both sides of the deal.  What ultimately brought the firm down was its failure to register as a money transmitter.  In May 2016, a grand jury in California's Northern District “returned a two-count indictment charging BTC-e and Vinnik with operation of an Unlicensed Money Services Business.”  Six months later, a grand jury pushed forward a twenty-one count superseding indictment against Vinnik and his firm. They alleged at no point had anti-money laundering policies set in place, “let alone an effective program for detecting and preventing suspicious transactions.”  Among the suspicious transactions were those from operator Vinnik, who allegedly skimmed money from clients and used the platform as a personal bank.  While Vinnik has denied the charges against him, even denying he was an executive of the firm, the attorney’s office is attempting to prove he “operated several administrative, financial, operational, and support accounts at BTC-e.”  Vinnik, a Russian national arrested while vacationing in Greece in July 2017, has previously asked for extradition to Russia. He faces a maximum 55 years in prison.

42382408,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9raw3,1564164032,Huawei CEO Calls on China to Create a Rival to Facebook's Libra Crypto,"Telecommunications giant Huawei’s chief executive has said that the time is ripe for China's government to preempt Facebook’s Libra.  Speaking in an interview with Italian media outlet L’economia, CEO Ren Zhengfei remarked that China has the capability to pursue such an undertaking. He was asked a question about U.S. global hegemony and Facebook's issuance of an international currency specifically.  Ren was quoted as saying (according to a translation):  ""Even China is able to issue such currencies, why wait for Libra? The strength of a state is greater than that of an Internet company.""  Ren was not necessarily looking to take his company toe-to-toe with the social media giant. Though his firm has made significant inroads in the blockchain space – including joining the Hyperledger consortium and releasing a blockchain-backed cloud service – he instead pointed to the advancements in blockchain technology made by the Chinese nation-state.  In May, the People’s Bank of China hired blockchain experts in a move to widen its distributed network investments, useful for “large scale transactions,” bank representatives said at the time.  Additionally, while some members of China’s central bank have said that Libra’s deployment could negatively impact the country’ economy, Wang Xin, head of the research bureau at the People's Bank of China, said the competition could propel the country to issue its own national cryptocurrency.  In fact, a few weeks after Libra was announced, searches on the China’s web search giant Weibo skyrocketed. This is in spite of the fact that Facebook has been banned in the country since 2009.  Ren's statements were translated from Italian.

The offering features colorful graphs illustrating different aspects of the network, such as network fees or the ""channels"" a user has opened to send lightning payments.  This is useful for users running ""lightning nodes,"" which users need to set up in order to use the network in the most secure way. Lndmon gives users a more tangible look into what's going on with their nodes, whether the user is a running a routing node and looking to make a little money or a bitcoin enthusiast who just want to know more about their node and the rest of the network.  The announcement blog post written by Lightning Labs software engineer Valentine Wallace, who led the project, explains:  ""As the network has grown over the past year, we’ve noticed gaps in its observability and the need for an easy-to-use tool for routing node operators to manage their nodes.""  There have even been instances when the tool might have even prevented problems with the network, Wallace argues in the blog post: ""This year, lack of such a suitable tool caused certain problems in the peer-to-peer network to remain undiscovered until they became harmful.""  As such, Wallace thinks Lndmon can ""help prevent problems by enabling users to monitor trends and take preventative action.""  But it isn't just for detecting problems. By looking at the graphs, users can take a better look at the history of their payments, or potentially use it to figure out how to pay the lowest fees when sending payments.  The tool is supposed to be easy to use, at least for developers. Once a user has their node up and running, it just takes a couple of extra steps to get their own Lndmon dashboard up and running.  Lightning Labs has plans to extend the tool further, such as supporting more lightning network data and allowing users to set up notifications when something happens they would like to know about.

42382419,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rbEv,1564137646,"Bull Case for Bitcoin Weakest Since February, Price Indicator Says","View  Bitcoin’s bullish momentum has weakened to five month lows, according to Chaikin Money Flow indicator.  That, coupled with the bearish lower highs pattern on short duration chart indicates BTC could fall back to the recent low of $9,049 and may even break lower.  BTC may bounce back to $10,300 if sellers again fail to penetrate the support at $9,600.  A UTC close above $11,120 is needed to revive the bullish view.      The bullish mood in the bitcoin (BTC) market is at its weakest in five months, according to key technical indicator.  The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) study, which incorporates both prices and trading volumes to gauge trend change and trend strength, is currently seen at 0.02 on the three-day chart.  A positive CMF indicates bullish bias. However, the latest reading is the lowest since Feb. 20, which means the market is least bullish on the top cryptocurrency in five months.  Chaikin Money Flow  BTC was trading at $4,000 five months ago, while as of writing, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $9,800 on Bitstamp – well above the 200-day moving average at $6,270. So, the long-term bias remains bullish.  However, the CMF’s retreat from the 21-month high of 0.40 to the current five-month lows validates the short-term bearish reversal signaled by a bearish lower highs pattern created by bitcoin during the recent pullback from $13,880 to $9,049.  Other short term technical studies are also biased bearish, as seen in the chart below.  Daily chart  BTC faced rejection (above left) at the descending trendline hurdle near $10,200 yesterday and closed below $9,900, leaving a candle with a long upper shadow – a bearish development.  The failure to take out the trendline hurdle also reinforced the bearish view put forward by the descending 5- and 10-day MAs and the bearish crossovers of the 5-, 50- and 10-,50-day MAs.  Further, the relative strength index is reporting bearish conditions with a below-50 print.  Hence, the stage looks set for a drop to the July 17 low of $9,049.  That said, the bears need progress soon, as BTC is again attempting a recovery, having clocked a low of $9,650 earlier today. Over the last three weeks, dips below $9,600 have been consistently short-lived (above right).  If that level continues to hold ground over the next few hours, then buyers may step in, lifting prices to the 50-day MA, currently at $10,304.  That said, the outlook will turn bullish only if prices rise above $11,120, invalidating the lower highs pattern.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

In a blog update on Thursday, the firm said the adjustments come ""in an effort to continue to be compliant and cooperative with US regulations as they currently exist""  So what does it mean for affected Abra users? The firm says:  ""Specifically, for Abra users in the United States is that we have to make some system modifications around our smart contract based synthetic assets. As a part of this effort we are migrating any synthetic assets to a native hosted wallet solution. On Abra, these are defined as anything other than Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).""  The ""synthetic asset"" is Abra's way of providing users with exposure to the movements of cryptocurrency prices, without them having to hold the actual crypto. For some cryptos, users can only make deposits into the app via a U.S.-based bank account, an American Express card, bitcoin, bitcoin cash or litecoin. These deposits can then be converted in the synthetic version.  The detail of the changes is as follows:  From Aug. 29, US users will no longer be able to hold Qtum (QTUM), bitcoin gold (BTG), EOS, OmiseGo (OMG), and status (SNT) will have to exchange or withdraw any holdings of those assets from the app by 11:59 p.m. EST (03:50 UTC) on that date.  If any users fail to do so by the deadline, the assets will automatically be converted to bitcoin, the firm says.  Customers in New York state will also be affected, and can only hold native bitcoin, ether, litecoin and bitcoin cash on Abra's app. All synthetic holdings will need to be exchanged or withdrawn by the same deadline as above, with any remaining synthetic holdings after that date to be converted to bitcoin.  Further, app users in New York will no longer be able to use bank ACH or wire transfers, or American Express cards for deposits and withdrawals after Aug. 29th.  Users outside the U.S. will not be affected by the changes. The private keys for bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin or ethereum held with the firm will continue to be held by U.S. users after the changes, the firm said.  It's not clear how temporary visitors to the U.S. might be affected. CoinDesk has reached out for comment and will update this article is a reply is received.

42382406,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ratX,1564128008,MIT Fellow Says Facebook 'Lifted' His Ideas for Libra Cryptocurrency,"Avid students of the literature on monetary innovation might feel deja vu when reading Facebook's Libra white paper.  Several aspects of the social network’s much-ballyhooed global cryptocurrency project uncannily resemble the vision laid out in a paper published last year in the Royal Society's Open Science publication.  For example, the Libra paper described a digital coin that would maintain its value because it was backed by a basket of fiat currencies and short-term debt. This echoed the July 2018 paper by MIT big-hitters Alex Lipton, Thomas Hardjono and Alex “Sandy” Pentland, who described an asset-backed, supra-national digital token. (To be sure, the assets in their proposal were commodities like oil or crops).  Continuing the similarities, Libra Association, a group of 27 financial, tech and VC companies tentatively committed to Facebook’s project, carried a whiff of the hypothetical consortium governing Tradecoin. Both proposed coins were intended to streamline domestic and cross-border payments and, more loftily, to extend financial services to the world’s underbanked. And of course, Libra and Tradecoin both would run on distributed ledgers.  Coincidences? Not in Lipton's view.  The MIT Connection Science Fellow told CoinDesk:  “Without being particularly obnoxious, I can tell you that the actual structure of Libra is pretty much lifted verbatim from the paper which Sandy Pentland and Thomas Hardjono and I published last year.”  Sounding a bit miffed, Lipton said the scholars' work was ""not mentioned in the Libra document at all, but, what adds a little bit of insult to injury is this paper was published as part of this free-for-all part of the Free Science part of the Royal Society effort."" (Unlike most of the society's journals, Open Science requires no subscription to read.)  Lipton, former head of Bank of America’s global quant business, wears a few hats. He advises fintech projects on working with central banks, including the Utility Settlement Coin’s technology provider Clearmatics. He is also the chief technical officer for Sila, a platform designed to help fintech firms interface with the financial system using a dollar-pegged stablecoin.  The ideas in the Royal Society paper appeared in an earlier version Lipton co-authored with Pentland, which was the cover article for an issue of Scientific American on the future of money, Lipton noted, adding:  “The Libra people cannot really say that they have not read that. Or, if they have not read that, they shouldn't be probably doing what they are doing in the first place.”  Facebook declined to comment.  Critiquing Libra  To be fair, the economic design of Libra, as stated in its white paper, aims to integrate harmoniously with the existing infrastructure; for example, the Libra Association says it doesn’t want to impinge on the purview of central banks.  Tradecoin, on the other hand, could be seen as notionally more of a challenger to the status quo, offering “a way that small countries, sovereign wealth funds, and retirement funds could get a fair shake in the world’s financial system, instead of being ignored or exploited by the big central banks,” as the authors put it in a more recent paper.  Lipton also noted that since Tradecoin would be backed by hard assets such as oil or commercial crops, this would dictate, to some degree, the consortium members. “We were thinking about raw material producers, supra-national organizations, and, possibly, a couple of large-scale payment providers, but certainly not the likes of Uber.”  In any case, a key design problem with Libra, said Lipton, is that the coin would be issued in a “non-immunized fashion, so to speak, against financial paper.”  Lipton explained that since it is hard to earn interest on cash, Libra will need to buy government securities and other high-grade paper as additional backing for the coin. As a result, the owner of the bond will receive money from Libra (which it will collect from consumers in return for libra coins) and this money will start to circulate in the system.  In addition, Libra will issue coins which, if they work as intended, will act as money as well. As such, there would be twice as much money in the system, with all the negative consequences, he said.  “In developing countries, it will cause enormous inflation because the amount of money will be kind of doubled, roughly speaking, in fact much more than doubled,” said Lipton. “I am not a big fan of quantity theory of money, but I am absolutely certain that as the amount of money explodes, prices will go up.”  That's clearly not how Libra sees it. The white paper describes a stabilization mechanism whereby authorized resellers will purchase the coin in response to demand – and conversely when people want to sell Libra they receive fiat.  But Lipton claimed money will be created implicitly, regardless of the design goals. “This is different from what happens when you or I buy bonds – we pay in money which starts to circulate, but cannot use bonds for payments directly – hence money does not multiply,” he said.  Despite the considerable regulatory headwinds Libra faces, if it can pull this off, the stakes are enormous, Lipton acknowledged.  If Libra can capture 10 percent of, say, $3 trillion per day of foreign exchange trade, and the member companies’ nodes charge 10 basis points as a transaction fee (bear in mind Visa and MasterCard charge 2-3 percent for their services) that’s already $300 million a day, said Lipton. Add on the benefit from interest payments expected from the collateral, which Lipton estimates could be about $10 billion to $20 billion per year, and the Libra Association’s members are making a pretty penny.  “It kind of crystalizes thinking, no question about it,” he said.

The appearance comes just a day after Sun penned an apology to the public, media and regulators for “over-marketing” the Buffett lunch. He didn’t specify which regulators he was referring to, but the letter has so far only been posted in simplified Chinese.  ""In the future, due to my illness, I will take some rest,"" he wrote in the Weibo post. “All efforts should return to blockchain tech development from marketing and hyping.”    #Tron party with @justinsuntron & @CryptoWendyO        It’s been a fun trip.

Ten YouTubers were flown into San Francisco for Tron Influencer Day to celebrate the one-year anniversary of Tron's acquisition of BitTorrent, the storied file-sharing platform founded in 2004.  Meanwhile, BitTorrent founder and current Chia CEO Bram Cohen seemed highly displeased. “Anybody know if Justin Sun is hard up for cash?” Cohen tweeted Thursday afternoon. “He isn’t letting the last payment for BitTorrent get out of escrow.” (Speaking to Decrypt, Sun flatly denied the accusation, saying, ""it has nothing to do with me."")  Sun's appearance proved to be an odd bookend to a weeklong saga about the polarizing entrepreneur. Reports surfaced Tuesday that he was under border control and barred from leaving China. Those reports were disproven later that day when Sun broadcast a video of himself from a San Francisco high-rise.  A new date for the postponed lunch has yet to be announced.

42382413,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rb4r,1564102818,Firm That Monitors USDC Stablecoin Audited Over $10 Billion in Client Assets,"The international auditing firm that attests to Circle's issuance of USDC stablecoins announced it has audited more than $10 billion worth of client assets in the first quarter of 2019, according to a statement.  The accounting firm Grant Thornton serves between 15 and 20 clients that are highly leveraged in crypto assets, including prominent crypto-denominated exchanges, according to Markus Veith, a partner at the firm. The attestations establish that a client’s holdings or investments exist and are fairly stated in the quantities claimed.  While discrepancies have been found between the blockchains and balance sheets, Veith was not at liberty to disclose such cases.  “We are constantly finding more coins than we’ve been told are out there,” said Johnny Lee, national practice leader for Forensic Technology Services, focusing in on “privacy coins that don’t really have an audit trail.”  Among the 40 cryptocurrencies the firm has scrutinized are bitcoin, ethereum, XRP, EOS, zcash, monero, and USDC as well as a number of ERC-20 tokens, according to Grant Thornton.  The firm uses a variety of methodologies designed for the architecture of each disparate blockchain. Sometimes it spins up reconstructed blockchains, a hybrid cloud, and “forensic nodes” – at a great, though unstated, expense – to reconcile a claimed asset with its supposed time-stamp, or equivalent metric of proof, according to Veith.  He also said each blockchain has its own quirks, or unexpected issues, mentioning that the private, permissioned Ripple “is quite a monster to set up.”  Grant Thornton does not perform 100 percent audits of a client’s portfolio – a process that is prohibitive by price and time – though the sample selections the firm tests sometimes run back to a blockchain’s genesis block.  To some extent, the firm learns as it goes. Starting out four years ago with one institutional client that only held bitcoin, Veith said the company took a “measured risk” to innovate and take on more digital assets. He also said since the market bottomed out in 2018, the firm’s clients have diversified their portfolios.  Correction (July 26, 13:41 UTC): The original article factually misstated that Grant Thornton attests to Coinbase's stablecoin; it has been updated to say Grant Thornton attests to Cricle's issuance of USDC.
