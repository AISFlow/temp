42378123,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7M9rB,1427924756,ESPN: St Petersburg Bowl to Drop Bitcoin Branding,"The 2015 edition of the St Petersburg Bowl will not be known as the Bitcoin St Petersburg Bowl, according to ESPN.  A representative from the TV news source would not comment as to whether the move foretells a sponsorship change for this year's event, or if it is currently seeking a new sponsor for the 2015 bowl game. Last year's event was sponsored by bitcoin processor BitPay, which inked a three-year deal to brand the college football playoff.  The spokesperson told CoinDesk:  “The decision to rebrand the event to the St. Petersburg Bowl was a mutual one between both BitPay and ESPN.”  While the 'Bitcoin Bowl' was a ratings hit and a symbolic event for the bitcoin community at large, its effectiveness as a marketing tool was called into question by the mixed merchant reaction to its promotional tactics.  The comment is a response to strong social media reaction that followed the removal of last year's bitcoin-centric imagery from the event's website and related social media accounts.  ESPN offered no additional comment, while BitPay has been unresponsive to requests for further information. A representative from Tropicana Field, the stadium that hosts the annual event, was unable to provide insight into the matter, stating:  ""We have no reason to think that bitcoin will not be back.""

42378103,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7M9ZZ,1427911835,Bitcoin Advocates Back Petition for BitLicense Safe Harbor Provision,"More than 70 digital currency industry businesses, executives and advocates are backing a petition that calls for the easing or eradication of allegedly onerous components of New York's BitLicense proposal.  Submitted as part of a recently closed public comment period, the measure has so far garnered support from companies such as Coinbase, Blockstream, BitPay, Circle and Ripple Labs, as well as notable developers and venture capitalists.  Overall, the petition seeks to convey the argument that it is ""unreasonable"" for the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to apply its provisions equally across the industry, arguing that creators of open-source protocols, micropayments providers, security intermediaries and smaller entrepreneurs should be excluded from certain coverage.  Penned by Coin Center's Aaron Wright and Yale Law School's Elizabeth Stark, the authors are still collecting signatures in an effort to galvanize attention around the issue.  Stark told CoinDesk:  ""The goal here was to bring a substantial part of the community to one proposal as opposed to different proposals so that there's strength in numbers.""  Stark and Wright were inspired to put together the proposal due to what Stark called their shared interest in Internet history and the belief that safe harbor policies such as this played an instrumental role in helping move the development of this technology forward.  The petition further included definitions for startups in each of its four proposed coverage areas, defining small startups as those that have been in operation for less than two years.  A longer version of the submitted document, stretching 15 to 20 pages, is currently being developed, Stark added.  New criticism  Overall, the paper is openly critical of what its authors called the high costs of compliance that the current iteration of the BitLicense would impose on these classes of startups, though it sought to frame its solution as ""a natural extension"" of the regulation's goals.  For example, the authors are keen to stress what they consider to be the untapped potential of bitcoin and blockchain technologies to lead to solutions that will solve challenges for society, while providing economic benefits to New York.  ""If allowed to flourish, this technology can provide compelling solutions for the 93 million Americans that are un- or underbanked, enable workers abroad to send remittances home without hefty fees, eliminate the substantial public policy challenge of continual data breaches where citizens’ personally identifiable information is compromised, and bring jobs to the state of New York,"" the petition reads.  During the safe harbor period, the authors stress that startups should still be required to follow security best practices, while complying with regulations put forth by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).  In an interview, Stark built on this idea, suggesting that fees for state-by-state licenses for any kind of licensure, be it a full license or a proposed transitional license, would be enough to prevent many startups from launching.  Community reaction  Signatories of the petition seemed similarly galvanized around the idea that bitcoin startups, even those in nascent stages, would currently need to pay for the license and its related compliance requirements.  Melanie Shapiro, CEO of multisig hardware wallet provider CryptoLabs, put forth such an opinion, telling CoinDesk:  ""I believe in a 24-month window that will give early-stage startups the opportunity to grow without the hinderance of filing for, and paying for a BitLicense.""  Brandon Goldman, co-founder of stealth FinTech startup FreshPay, emphasized this point, suggesting that any path forward for bitcoin startups should be ""clear and reasonable"".  Tom Mornini, founder of API developer Subledger, went a step further by arguing that the current BitLicense will harm community development, and by extension, force innovators to relocate abroad.  ""As a serial entrepreneur, I knew that this would be bad for New York, possibly bad for the US, bad for cryptocurrency and horrible for entrepreneurs,"" he said.

42378112,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7M9jd,1427905936,Factom Raises $140k in First Day of 'Software Sale',"Factom has raised 579 BTC, or roughly $140,000, through the first day of its crowdsale.  The blockchain-based record-keeping network launched its crowdsale yesterday at 17:00 UTC on decentralized application platform Koinify, offering 2,000 Factoid tokens (FACTs) for every 1 BTC pledged by prospective users.  The pricing values Factoids at the same initial asking price as Ethers, the token sold during decentralized publishing platform Ethereum's 2014 crowdsale that eventually garnered upwards of $12.7m.  Factom Foundation board chairman David Johnston pointed to the fact that the project had sold more than 1m facts in the first day as another indicator of its success.  Johnston told CoinDesk:  ""I believe this first day of software sales for Factom shows there is strong interest in technology that is focused on scaling the blockchain and providing its features of transparency and honesty to whole new categories of businesses.""  The $140,000 in first-day sales surpasses the $111,000 decentralised messaging service GetGems raised during the first two weeks of its invite-only sale, the first to be held on Koinify's platform last December.  Upon launch, Factoids will serve as the payment method users will need to communicate with Factom's servers. Factoids will run on their own blockchain within Factom.  The ""early bird"" period of the sale, during which this introductory price is set to be offered, is scheduled to run through 7th April.

42378104,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7M9YJ,1427905255,CoinDesk Launches Moon Bureau,"Disclaimer: This article was posted as part of CoinDesk's April Fools' Day coverage.  Taking advice from r/bitcoin’s best-loved mascot, ToTheMoonGuy┗(°0°)┛ ..○, CoinDesk is shutting down its operations on planet earth today.  The news site, which hinted at plans to relocate to the moon via Instagram 10 months ago, deployed its first staff member, an intern, on its lunar hub this morning.  Speaking over a garbled satellite connection, he said:  ""There isn’t much bitcoin here. Come to think of it, there isn't any news, oxygen or even cheese ... Maybe it’s a mistake. It seemed like a good idea at the time.""  Despite having to survive on a limited oxygen supply, most of the team seem over the moon about the opportunity to conquer yet another planet, or satellite – whatever.  CoinDesk's US editor Pete Rizzo counted himself among the impressed. He said the floating rock was representative of the bitcoin industry's values: ""cold and lifeless and ultimately too far away from the general public to matter"".  Others employees were hostile to the relocation plans, describing the 384,400 km trip as ""lunacy"". Developer Jonathan Bull said he was apathetic about the new location, adding:  ""CoinDesk's current office has no atmosphere anyway, so it won't exactly be a huge change.""  Diversification  Competition in the bitcoin media space has rocketed in recent months, with many mainstream media outlets now devoting resources to digital currency coverage.  To combat this, CoinDesk is diversifying its offering with the launch of FiatDesk – a microsite devoted exclusively to the coverage of fiat currencies like the US dollar.  CoinDesk CEO Jeremy Bonney said:  ""Bitcoin is over. Government-issued currencies (which feature private blockchains and full mining centralisation) are clearly the future of money. The technology behind fiat money hasn't changed for decades, it's that good.""  The editorial team say they hope to settle in quickly to continue monitoring the growth of other currencies that push the boundaries – of taste and respectability, including wankcoin, scamcoin, sausagecoin and potcoin.  Bonney confirmed that all employees will be able to return to earth when bitcoin passes the $5,000 mark.  This article was co-authored by Grace Caffyn.

42378105,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7M9ap,1427889889,"Czech Police Seize $345,000 Property Linked to Bitcoin Hack","Czech police have seized a luxury property purchased with bitcoin by a couple previously linked to the hack of drug bazaar Sheep Marketplace.      The house, reportedly worth around $345,000, was bought in a series of transactions by Tomáš Jiřikovský and his partner Eva Bartošová. The property was originally registered under Jiřikovský's grandfather, Jan Goliath.      Sheep Marketplace shut down in December 2013, following claims hackers had absconded with approximately $5.3m in bitcoin. Users who tracked the stolen funds on the blockchain voiced suspicions that the theft was an inside job. A site named Sheep Market Scam alleging that a further 40,000 BTC was moved to an address previously associated with the site.      According to reports, The Ministry of Finance's Financial Analytical Unit (FAU) flagged a payment of approximately $35,000 from bitcoin exchange Bitstamp to Bartošová, who was unable to account for the origin of the funds. Further payments to a lawyer and a realtor were also reportedly tracked.      A loosely translated report published by FAU, noted payments to Bitstamp Ltd, which it refers to as 'BL':      ""During the inspection of a bank we caught an international payment on behalf of a newly opened bank account under the name of 'EB', which was sent by a certain company 'BL', that runs a virtual currency exchange in the European Union. During the investigation we found that the payment was intended for person 'TJ', a partner of 'EB'.""              The report continued: ""We found that the name 'TJ' is mentioned in the context of theft of digital currency from the market 'SM'. In the investigation we detected more payments in hundreds of thousands and millions of Czech crowns that went to the accounts of 'EB' and 'TJ', from the company 'BL', to buy a property and other things.""      The FAU confirmed that a complaint for suspected money laundering had been filed according to section 216 of the criminal code. CoinDesk has contacted the FAU to determine whether any arrests have been made.    Denial of involvement    Allegations of Jiřikovský's and Bartošová's involvement with Sheep Marketplace first surfaced in 2013, with Redditor 'throwme1121' claiming that the perpetrators were Czech back in November 2013.    Throwme1121's allegations were based on another Reddit post by researcher Gwern Branwen and a document he uploaded on Pastebin.  At the time, the couple released a statement denying any involvement with the illicit marketplace. ""We are web hosting a fan page for the sheepmarketplace.com domain, but no the real marketplace,"" read the translated statement.  Community reacts  Karel Kyovsky, owner of General Bytes, a Prague-based bitcoin ATM manufacturer, said the recent media coverage was likely to have a negative impact on the average Czech reader. ""Those who do not know much about bitcoin will think that it serves as a tool for criminals,"" he said, adding:  ""As a bitcoin believer, I know that bitcoin is not a tool for criminals. It is a technology that will change our lives in the next 10 years, like the internet did.""  Kyovsky agreed with Alena Vranova, director of the Czech startup behind the Trezor bitcoin vault, Satoshi Labs, that educating people to handle their bitcoin securely is of great importance to safeguard against future theft.
