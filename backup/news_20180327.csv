Specifically, the project's participants will examine whether ""innovative settlement systems,"" such as those based on DLT, are able to interact with its proposed 'renewed' cloud-based RTGS service. Project participants include payments technology providers Baton Systems and Token, R3 and Clearmatics.  It will also aim to pinpoint ways in which the service's ""functionality could be expanded"" through the use of new technologies.  The UK central bank said that it hopes the firms' involvement will ""give broader insight into the range of functionality the Bank might need to offer to support this sector.""

The release notes for its Radeon Software Adrenalin Edition 18.3.4, published Monday, explained that one aspect of the driver improvement addresses efficiency problems experienced when using GPUs to mine cryptocurrencies.  As the statement explained:  ""Some blockchain workloads may experience lower performance than expected when compared to previous Radeon Software releases.""  As previously reported, AMD has developed drivers in the past that improved GPU performance when mining cryptocurrencies. The Radeon Software Crimson ReLive Edition Beta for Blockchain Compute software was first released last August.  That software was released on an ""as is"" basis, according to the release notes, ""and will not be supported with further updates, upgrades or bug fixes"" – suggesting that, for the time being, AMD isn't eyeing regular fixes for cryptocurrency-related problems.  The drivers were unique in that they were ""not intended for graphics or gaming workloads,"" according to the company’s release notes.  Stepping back, the move is just the latest from GPU manufacturers whose products have been swept up by cryptocurrency miners.  AMD, in particular, noted in its most recent 10-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that a decline in the cryptocurrency market could hurt its business if miners buy fewer GPUs, as previously reported.

Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin ordered 18moons, Across Platforms, Mattervest, Pink Ribbon and Sparkco to cease their ICO campaigns Tuesday, following investigations into each of the companies.  Government officials found that they were all in violation of the state's ""General Laws,"" which define securities as stocks, bonds or investment contracts that guarantee a financial return, as defined within the orders. The halts were part of a broader inquiry into token sales being conducted by the state government.  All of the companies are further required to offer to return funds to their investors within 30 days. The companies would have an additional 45 days to actually return the funds, starting from when the investor accepts the refund.  The startups will have to provide a list of every refunded investor after paying back the companies, according to the orders.  While the orders noted that the campaigns “shall permanently cease and desist from selling unregistered or non-exempt securities” within the state, all of the startups are able to register their tokens as securities - or apply to sell “exempt from registration securities” - in the future.

42401367,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbUBZ,1522171805,Ford Patent Envisions Car-to-Car Crypto Transactions,"A new patent awarded to Ford suggests the U.S. automaker is considering the use of cryptocurrency to let cars on the road communicate with each other and reduce traffic.  The patent  – ""Vehicle-to-vehicle cooperation to marshal traffic"" – was published Tuesday and awarded to Ford Global Technologies, LLC. It focuses on ways to alleviate traffic congestion, proposing that communication to coordinate speeds between vehicles can counteract, in part, ""the psychology of human drivers who focus on their individual travel time preferences.""  The document published Tuesday details a ""Cooperatively Managed Merge and Pass (CMMP) system"" in which ""driving behavior is monitored, recorded, and evaluated in a collective manner by themselves and other participating vehicles.""  The application goes on to explain:  ""This system would temporarily allow for particular cooperative vehicles (sometimes referred to as 'consumer vehicles') to drive at higher speeds in less-occupied lanes of traffic and also to merge and pass freely when needed. Other participating cooperative vehicles (sometimes referred to as 'merchant vehicles') voluntarily occupy slower lanes of traffic to [allow] the consumer vehicle to merge into their lanes and pass as needed.""  Notably, it outlines how a kind of cryptocurrency called CMMP tokens could be used to facilitate the messages between vehicles, stating:  ""The CMMP system operates with individual token-based transactions, where the merchant vehicles and the consumers' vehicles agree to trade units of cryptocurrency (sometimes referred to as 'CMMP tokens'). The CMMP tokens are used to validate and authorize a transaction in which, at consumer vehicles' request, the merchant vehicles either occupy slower lanes of traffic themselves, or allow the consumer vehicle to merge into their own lane and pass as necessary.""  Additionally, the token payments would be used as a kind of on-the-road credit within the proposed system.  ""In some examples, the time allotted to the request of the consumer vehicle is based on the number of CMMP tokens chosen by the consumer vehicle to be spent at that particular time,"" the patent document states. ""For example, a driver of a consumer vehicle which is running late for an appointment may request to pass any participating merchant vehicles for a duration of 10 minutes on a particular road or highway for 60 CMMP tokens, at a rate of 10 seconds preferential access per token.""  Though the automaker hasn't revealed much about its work with blockchain to date, a job posting from last year indicated that the company was looking to develop some in-house expertise on the subject.  ""We are looking for a strategic thinker and researcher to lead and pioneer work in the branch of Blockchain technology applied to mobility use cases that would help deliver superior user experiences for our customers,"" the company wrote at the time, as reported by Trustnodes.

Reuters  reported Tuesday that Konstantin Vyshkovsky, who heads Russia's Finance Ministry state debt department, told reporters that Venezuela had not offered to pay some of the amount it owes using the petro, which launched in February.  Vyshkovsky's remarks come days after Time Magazine reported that Russian president Vladimir Putin approved of the petro as a tool to evade U.S. sanctions, and described the process of launching the cryptocurrency as ""a collaboration"" between the two nations.""  Deputy director of the Information and Press Department of the Foreign Ministry Artyom Kozhin pushed back against the claims that Russian government officials aided Venezuela in developing the petro.  Further, Time reported that Russian billionaires Dennis Druzhkov and Fyodor Bogorodsky aided in the petro's development.  However, this report is ""fake news,"" Kozhin claimed, saying that Russian financial authorities never ""participated in this project,"" adding that a meeting between Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and Venezuelan minister of economy and finance Simon Zerpa was largely unrelated to cryptocurrencies.  Kozhin added:  ""During the course of the meeting held on February 21, 2018 in Moscow, Venezuela's Minister of Economy and Finance Mr. [Simon] Zerpa indeed handed over a booklet on the cryptocurrency to the Russian Finance Minister exclusively for the purpose of informing Russian partners about this project.""  The petro's sale is ongoing, as previously reported. While Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro has made claims of raising more than $5 billion to date, the country has released no evidence to support these claims. It is unclear how much money the government has actually brought in to date.

42401377,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbULP,1522165533,Central Banks Say Blockchain Could Shake Up Securities Settlement,"A newly published report from the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan argues that distributed ledger tech (DLT) could be used to create new securities settlement mechanisms, including ""cross-chain atomic swaps"" between unconnected ledgers.  The findings  are the result of the central banks' joint DLT research initiative, dubbed Project Stella, which was launched in December 2016.  Intended to ""contribute to the broader debate around the usability of DLT,"" this particular phase of the project examined ""how the delivery of securities against cash could be conceptually designed and operated in a DLT environment.""  The report focuses on the delivery versus payment (DvP) securities settlement method, in which assets are linked such that the transfer of one asset is executed if and only if the transfer of the other asset also occurs – this is also referred to as ""atomicity.""  Researchers designed three prototypes using three platforms: Corda, Elements and Hyperledger Fabric. According to the report, they found that DvP could be executed in a DLT system with cash and securities on both a single ledger and between separate ledgers.  ""Conceptual analysis and experiments have proven that cross-ledger DvP could function even without any connection between individual ledgers – a novelty which does not exist in today's set-up,"" the report states, going on to explain:  ""Functionalities such as 'cross-chain' atomic swaps have the potential to help ensure the interoperability between ledgers (of either the same or different DLT platforms) without necessarily requiring connections and institutional arrangements between them.""  However, the report also cautions that cross-ledger DvP systems could add complexity and operational challenges to the settlement process. For example, DvP transactions between unconnected ledgers would necessitate ""several process steps and interactions between the seller and the buyer,"" it says.  Likewise, such systems could affect transaction speed and ""require the temporary blockage of liquidity."" The lack of system synchronization could also ""expose participants to principal risk if one of the two counterparties does not complete the necessary process steps,"" the researchers added.  Indeed, the conclusion that the technology isn't ready to replace settlement systems was highlighted in last September's report on Project Stella.  As such, the report concludes that ""further analysis on the safety and efficiency of individual approaches [to applying DLT to DvP arrangements] is warranted,"" in addition to a full legal analysis, which is beyond the scope of the existing project.

42401382,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbUPL,1522159219,Bitcoin: Safe Haven Asset or Lead Indicator for the S&P?,"It's been a tough first quarter for both bitcoin and equities across the globe.  Interestingly, amid the downturn, the historically uncorrelated financial assets have moved pretty much in tandem since early February, forcing experts to search for reasons behind the growing relationship.  To start with, bitcoin bulls have been arguing since the early years that the cryptocurrency shares many of the characteristics of gold (a classic safe haven asset). For instance, many consider it a great store of value, given its limited supply of 21 million. Accordingly, the cryptocurrency is expected to put on a good show during times of stress in the broader financial markets.  Yet, since the S&P 500 index, the benchmark for equities across the globe, fell from a record high of $2,872 to $2,532 in the two weeks to Feb. 9, it should have been the perfect time for bitcoin to score gains and strengthen its safe-haven appeal.  However, the comparative study of bitcoin and S&P 500 reveals that wasn't the case.  Comparison chart: Bitcoin and S&P 500  The above chart (BTC price as per Coinbase) shows:  Both bitcoin and the S&P fell below the 200-day moving average (MA) in the first half of February.  In the subsequent weeks, both assets witnessed a corrective rally and ended up forming a double top bearish reversal-like pattern.  Furthermore, bitcoin has been leading the S&P 500 index by a few days.  For instance:  BTC bottomed out at $6,000 on Feb.6, while the S&P index did so at $2,532 on Feb. 9.  The near 90-degree corrective rally in BTC ran out of steam at $11,775 on Feb. 20, while the ""V-shaped"" recovery in the S&P faced exhaustion on Feb. 27.  BTC resumed its sell-off on March 5, while the S&P found fresh offers on March 13.  Both assets fell back to their respective 200-day moving average levels last week.  Clearly, the correlation has strengthened and it appears as though bitcoin is working as a lead indicator, or a risk barometer, for the broader financial markets, and an argument can be made that bitcoin is not holding up its reputation as a ""digital gold"" or a safe-haven asset.  That said, it's worth noting that correlation does not mean causation – that is, BTC is not necessarily causing the drop in the S&P, or vice versa.  The S&P 500 index, or the equity markets, in general, will likely be reporting losses for the first quarter, largely due to fears of faster Fed rate hikes and the rising bond yields, political turmoil in Washington and increased odds of US-China trade war.  Meanwhile, bitcoin has taken a hit, in part due to deeper crackdown on cryptocurrency trading in South Korea and China. Furthemore, the cryptocurrency was due for correction following a staggering rally to an all-time high of $20,000 in December.  So, while there is no common thread between the drop in equities and bitcoin, the correlation between the two has strengthened – and that's most likely because the investor community is still not ready to accept notoriously volatile bitcoin as a safe haven asset such as gold and U.S. treasuries. Not yet, anyway.

42401366,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbUAa,1522152030,Vitalik Wants You to Pay to Slow Ethereum's Growth,"Could adding a new fee help preserve ethereum in the long term?  It's a contentious statement in light of the debates ongoing across blockchains over how and when users should pay to support what amount to global computing networks. However, the concept is now gaining notable momentum on ethereum, most recently from the creator of the world's second-largest blockchain himself, Vitalik Buterin.  Buterin's concept  , described in a recent blog post, revolves around so-called ""rent fees,"" whereby users would be asked to pay to use the network based on how long they'd like their data to remain accessible on the blockchain.  The idea has recently seen interest generally, as ethereum developers have sought to cope with the platform's increased adoption, and, in turn, the increased amount of data being added that all network nodes need to store.  In short, it's a tragedy of the commons issue – if too many people use the resource for free, the network starts taking on the costs itself. And there's plenty of evidence to suggest that there is already reason to worry.  With rising use spurred by popular apps and ICOs, notable developers, including ethereum researchers Vlad Zamfir and Phil Daian, believe the problem needs to be addressed now.  ""No one likes talking about rent, but we need to have this conversation,"" ethereum developer and Thiel fellow Raul Johnson recently tweeted.  ""Core developers need to relay this information to the smart contract developer community ASAP to get their opinions on the matter,"" he continued, adding:  ""The current system as it stands is unsustainable.""  Fees, explored  Still, Buterin's backing could be a sign that momentum might build around the idea.  So far, he has broached the idea with a pair of proposals on the subject, including a succinct possible solution he calls ""a simple and principled way to compute rent fees."" And Buterin's first proposal is as simple as its title suggests.  The idea is to compute fees based on a long-term limit on the ""state,"" a slice of special ethereum data that node operators need to store, which tracks who owns the current information about all apps (including user balances, who has posted so much data in, say, a Twitter replacement app and so on).  Under the proposal, state data stored in a node computer's RAM – now about 5GB – will never be allowed to exceed 500 GB. To ensure this, users will have to pay fees based on how long their data is stored. In this way, data is kept in check, since fees will grow if storage creeps toward that limit.  One notable part of Buterin's proposal is that he tries to incorporate a scaling change that ethereum developers have long wanted to add to the platform.  Although the most recent roadmap claims deployment is still years away, ""sharding,"" as it's known, could potentially boost the amount of resources a database can handle by splitting up the data. In ethereum, the idea is, each node wouldn't have to store all of ethereum's historical data – just a slice of it.  ""With sharding, the maximum acceptable state size would be per-shard, so the above fees would be decreased by a factor of 100,"" Buterin said.  Buterin also tries to address another key problem with rent: its bad user-experience. Most rent proposals today would require users to know how long their data will need to live ahead of time, which would be prone to error.  His second proposal explores a way of quashing this annoying guessing game by letting users use their state even after it has expired. Essentially, they would prove that their state existed at a previous point in time, with the help of a cryptographic technique called a ""Merkle proof.""  Deep-rooted problem  One problem with all this, though, is that fees, kind of like taxes, are never popular.  Bitcoin's years-long debate, for example, mostly centered on fees and the trade-offs associated with them. If fees are increased, less data will be stored, making full nodes easier to run. The downside, of course, is it would make the cryptocurrency more expensive to use.  One question is whether ethereum users and developers will react the same way, arguing ""the rent is too damn high."" In this way, Johnson worries that suddenly adding extra fees would alarm developers who have already deployed apps on ethereum.  Johnson argues for changes that aren't so knee-jerk and should be phased in slowly to give developers time to adjust.  Not to mention, some believe a similar rent needs to be applied to all cryptocurrencies. Indeed, scaling problems – and the associated fees – are a problem across blockchains.  Daian went as far as to argue that bitcoin needs to apply the same model. Like ethereum, bitcoin currently doesn't charge for the lifetime of a coin.  ""Bitcoin is not free of these issues,"" he said, arguing that its simpler model incentivizes state bloat in a variety of ways, ""exposing users to a variety of other consequences of mispriced storage.""  Pricing resources to the right degree is such an important area of research, that Daian, a smart contract researcher at IC3, and others at the institute have set up an initiative called Project Chicago dedicated to the effort.  Even if this is a lesser-explored area and researchers haven't yet found a concrete solution, he's optimistic.  Daian concluded:  ""No cryptocurrency has figured out good models for pricing these resources thus far, and ethereum's storage rent represents a step in the right direction towards these goals.""

In an announcement Tuesday, the EU markets watchdog said it has agreed to temporarily adjust the leverage limit for cryptocurrency-related ""contracts for difference"" (CFD) products to 2:1 – a move that will require retail investors to initially pay at least 50 percent of the total CFD value.  With a CFD, one party agrees to pay the other party if the value of the underlying asset changes.  The policy comes after the agency started a public consultation process in January, arguing at the time that the volatility of cryptocurrencies as an underlying asset for CFDs poses serious concerns for retail investor protection.  With initial leverage then standing at 5:1 – meaning investors could pay just 20 percent of the total CFD value initially – the agency had mulled either a lower leverage limit (2:1 or 1:1) or even banning distribution, marketing or sales of these products altogether.  In today's announcement, the ESMA indicated that cryptocurrencies still remain an area of concern, and may consider tougher measures in the future in order to protect investors.  The regulator stated:  ""Due to the specific characteristics of cryptocurrencies as an asset class the market for financial instruments providing exposure to cryptocurrencies, such as CFDs, will be closely monitored, and ESMA will assess whether stricter measures are required.""  The new measure come at a time when the cryptocurrency market is seeing growing interest from retail investors, and brokers and dealers have responded to this demand with new products.

The cryptocurrency found acceptance below the crucial support of $8,217 (prices as per Bitfinex) at 12:00 UTC yesterday, signaling the corrective rally from the low of $7,240 has ended. The emboldened bears then pushed bitcoin down to $7,716 earlier today – its lowest since March 18.  Twitter's  decision to ban all ads related to initial coin offers (ICOs), token sales, exchanges and wallet services may have played a role in pushing prices lower, although it is worth noting that bitcoin had been trading on the back foot well before Twitter news hit the wires, and that the ban news had been widely anticipated in the media.  As of writing, the average price on leading exchanges, as represented by CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), stands at $7,935 – down 2.5 percent from the previous day's close (as per UTC).  Clearly, the bears are in control, however, so far the downside has been capped around $7,700. The 1-hour chart shows the cryptocurrency could rally to $8,271 (former support, now resistance) on the back of a bullish price-RSI divergence.  1-hour chart  An upside break of the falling channel could yield a re-test of $8,550-$8,600, however, that will be easier said than done, as suggested by the bearish setup on the daily chart below.  Daily chart  The rounding top-like pattern has established the area around $9,000 as a stiff resistance zone. It also indicates another lower high (bearish pattern) has been made at $9,177.5 (March 21 high).  Further, Monday's close below $8,211 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement) pushed the 5-day moving average (MA) below the 10-day MA (bear cross). Meanwhile, the relative strength index (RSI) has rolled over into the bearish territory (below 50.00).  Hence, prices look set to revisit the recent low of $7,240 and any corrective rally above $8,271 (former support, now resistance) will likely be transient.  Weekly chart (Linear scale): Major support is seen at $6,600  The ascending weekly 50-MA meets the rising trendline (drawn from the July low and September low) around $6,600.  View  A minor corrective rally to $8,271–$8,300 cannot be ruled out, but the sustainability of gains is in question.  Overall, bitcoin looks set to revisit the $7,240 (March 18 low). A violation there would open up downside towards $6,600.  In the larger scheme of things, only a convincing break above $11,700 would revive the bullish outlook.

In a press conference hosted Tuesday, the operator of South Korea's largest messenger app, Kakao Talk, said the company has launched a new division to start developing a blockchain-powered platform for completion within the year. The new product will be open to the public as a foundation for application developers, Yonhap reports.  Called Ground X, the subsidiary is also planned to integrate future blockchain-based services with Kakao's existing internet offerings, according to Kakao's co-CEOs Joh Su-yong and Yeo Min-soo.  ""Now at Kakao 3.0, we will continue to explore our growth potential by seamlessly integrating services among Kakao companies and actively building presence in the global market,"" Joh said at a news conference.

As per ZDNet on Tuesday, Joh denied any plans plan for an ICO, either within South Korea or through an overseas method to bypass regulation in the country that outlawed the token-based fundraising method in September 2017.

42401365,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbUCY,1522137656,"If Facebook Can Be Worth Billions, Why Can't Cryptos?","Pete Rizzo is editor-in-chief for CoinDesk.      It’s been a rough month for Mark Zuckerberg.  In the fallout from the Cambridge Analytica fiasco, in which it was found a third-party data provider was mining user information on behalf of political groups, Facebook and its founder have faced an outcry of criticism over the company’s role as leader-supreme data custodian for the developed world.  But for the crypto community, the resulting plunge in Facebook’s stock price offers an instructive example for a fundamental argument: whether the current cryptocurrency market, in which more than 20 blockchain networks are “valued” in excess of $1 billion, is overheated or in a “bubble.”  To answer that question, it’s helpful to ask another one – namely, how exactly is it possible that Facebook, which collects users' identifying data and connects them through messaging, is valued so highly to begin with?  Indeed, it doesn’t seem like consumers are apt to bat an eye when they hear Facebook is worth nearly $500 billion, or that WeChat, an app which offers largely the same service for a China-based audience, is valued similarly. (Even Snap, a smaller fish in the pond, is valued at $20 billion, a figure that dwarfs all but the largest cryptocurrency networks.)  The analogy offers a sharp retort to the criticisms that bitcoin and other blockchains can’t possibly sustain or justify their current valuations, or achieve market capitalizations that exceed what we observe today in more ""rational"" times.  A useful question here is, if all social networks are created equal, using pretty much the same combination of technologies, how can they produce so much value?  After all, according to crypto critics, there’s no reason to have so many coins when they’re all using the same basic building blocks. Here in the market, however, we have an example of an almost wholly contrary outcome.  Marginal differences in technology  What might be most remarkable is that these naysayers, if they were to look closely at their phones, would uncover a swath of apps – SMS, Telegram, Signal, Slack, Skype, etc – all of which offer, in the grand scheme of things, what amount to slight variations on the same communications experience.  Put simply, it would seem, there’s a big market for “features,” or slight variations on popular tools, at least when the primary product is a mode of expression.  It follows that all of these social networks have different valuations for at least two reasons – the unique and different make-ups of their user bases and the variety of specific ways they offer users to communicate across the globe.  You might use Snapchat if you want to send a picture, WeChat if you wanted to talk to someone in Asia, or Signal if you wanted a truly encrypted, private experience.  In this case, you can think of the end user base as a form of liquidity and the features as the rules by which those interactions are governed. Some, like Twitter, might produce more casual relationships, while others, like Facebook, could be more familial.  Still, each network unlocks value in offering unique access to a certain kind of contact. The message is the same in each, the same mix of characters, emoticons and images.  What’s different is the network, how it’s valued by the users, and how they use it.  An argument for many cryptos  It would seem, then, that a similar argument could be applied to money and asset ownership by virtue of the new protocols that enable their expression – blockchains and cryptocurrencies.  Here, it’s helpful to think of what a starkly different environment today’s messaging protocols offer when compared to say, Bell Atlantic, or another long-forgotten phone company. Cherry-picking a somewhat random and self-serving example from a Google search, Bell Atlantic was valued at $125 billion at the time it was the largest local phone company the U.S.  My hunch is if you examined that data, you'd find all the market capitalizations of large telecos don't add up directly to those of communications companies today.  The implication is that internet protocols didn’t merely shift the value already created by communication, they unlocked more of it than was ever thought possible. Armed with the ability to communicate in infinitesimally small interactions (poke Zuck, anyone?) users appear to want to exercise that power and create new value streams.  Applied to blockchains, why couldn’t similar variations unlock similarly massive amounts of value?  I’d say the Telegram ICO is starting to make a bit more sense.

42428716,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdcDh,1522123252,Child Porn On Bitcoin? Why This Doesn't Mean What You Might Think,"""Would you stop running your full node if you found out that there was child porn encoded in the blockchain?""  The question, posed by ethereum developer Vlad Zamfir through a Twitter poll last week, has been discussed before, but it's recently resurfaced after a widely-publicized report from RWTH Aachen University found one graphic image of child porn and 274 links to content depicting child abuse stored within the bitcoin blockchain.  The report goes on to contend that because downloading or transmitting child porn is a sex crime, participating in bitcoin as a miner or node operator could be illegal.  While the report didn't explicitly compare this issue to the laws of any particular country, it's particularly notable in the U.S., wherein Congress recently passed a controversial bill package dubbed SESTA-FOSTA that looks to hold internet service providers (ISPs) and other internet users liable for illicit content that they share, whether unknowingly or not.  Up until SESTA-FOSTA passed, section 230 of the Communications Decency Act protected ISPs and other internet users from this kind of transmission, saying that they would not be ""treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider."" Currently, it is unclear whether section 230 will be completely nullified by SESTA-FOSTA.  As such, the crypto community more broadly has been debating the merits of the RWTH Aachen University paper and what could possibly happen as governments work to clamp down on illicit activity throughout the world.  Zamfir's poll, for instance, got 2,300 responses – only 15 percent said they'd stop running their bitcoin full node if child porn is encoded in the blockchain. And Princeton professor Arvind Narayanan tweeted that the mainstream media's response to the report was ""unsurprisingly superficial,"" adding, ""First, the law is not an algorithm. Intent is an important factor in determining legality.""  Still, this raises ethical questions about immutable ledgers that allow anyone to add unmoderated data to a shared, immutable record.  Speaking to this issue, Cardozo Law School professor Aaron Wright, who's also the chair of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance's Legal Industry Working Group, told CoinDesk:  “It’s part of the tension between this hard to modify data structure, the blockchain, and the requirements in certain pockets of law. In the U.S., it can manifest itself in child pornography. In Europe, it can manifest itself in the right to be forgotten.”  Hidden pathways  But central to grasping the matter is understanding just what kind of illicit data is on the bitcoin blockchain. First and foremost, it's helpful to understand that this content doesn't appear in the form of JPEG images or video files that can suddenly pop up on a user's computer.  The offensive content is instead housed in the blockchain in the form of links buried alongside all the other data sent with a transaction. As such, fishing this out and decoding it would take a great deal of effort.  Expanding on that process and addressing concerns of child porn, Washington D.C.-based non-profit Coin Center wrote in a blog post, ""A copy of the blockchain does not literally have within it Bible verses and images but instead has random gibberish text strings that, if one knows where they are, one could put in the effort to decode them to their original form. Unfortunately, some sick individuals have also added encoded images of child abuse.""  Plus, every U.S. state's handling of the disseminating of illicit material is different, but recalling Narayanan's sentiment, most laws hold people accountable only if they “knowingly possess” or produce, sell, broadcast or access the content “with intent to view.”  According to Wright:  “If you need knowledge, you’d need to take affirmative steps and actions to disseminate this specific information.”  Since most bitcoin users have no idea which data contains these hidden pathways to illicit content, many believe RWTH Aachen University's report was a bit misleading.  Not only that, but this issue doesn't only exist for bitcoin; nearly all blockchains allow for data to be added to transactions, meaning anyone with the right technical skills could add the same illicit content to any open-source blockchain.  Dumping the data  Because cryptocurrencies have continued to garner more attention as of late, it seems many people in the community want to find solutions for the current illicit content that's encoded in the bitcoin blockchain.  Cornell University professor Emin Gun Sirer took to Twitter to explain that ""regular cryptocurrency software"" lacks the decoder tool needed to reconstruct content from a specific encoding. But since it's not impossible, he continued, network participants could remove the content by choosing not to store the content of some transactions, instead only storing ""the hash and side effects.""  Along similar lines, bitcoin developer Matt Corallo said knowledgeable developers could also encrypt questionable data or find other ways to make it inaccessible.  ""If having such information in the encrypted form is okay, then simply encrypting the data at rest would solve the issue. If it's more than that, there are still workarounds,"" Corallo said.  Yet, he continued, saying that more clarity is needed in defining what's exactly illegal before the developers can address these things.  What is clear, though, is that if a node operator or miner is personally adding or aware of someone else adding child porn to the blockchain, they are legally required to alert the authorities.  And while that could be challenging given bitcoin's pseudonymous nature, Wright said there are ways for law enforcement agencies to track people down.  “If you are recording information to a blockchain, you often have a record of who was uploading that information. So much like with issues related to tax evasion or terrorist financing, you can mine through a blockchain and try to deanonymize who the party was who uploaded it,"" Wright said, adding:  ""A blockchain would probably not be a great place to store indecent or obscene information.”  Hard drive image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/03/27/child-porn-on-bitcoin-why-this-doesnt-mean-what-you-might-think,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/15e9e7eb548124b9dbcfa50d781ab7b67bf43ad9-1500x895.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42428701,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdbhh,1522114259,Blythe Masters' Next Move? Blockchain SDKs,"Blockchain startup Digital Asset has revealed a new project aimed at streamlining the way systemically important financial infrastructures access its technology.  Led by former JP Morgan global commodities boss Blythe Masters, the startup is in the process of packaging its custom smart contract language DAML into easy-to-use software development kits (SDKs) for customers.  Already an active ingredient in its existing partnerships (such as its work with the Australian Securities Exchange), the creation of the SDKs stands to accelerate the rate new financial infrastructure providers can build with the technology, Masters says.  An early version of the kits are now being explored by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a Digital Asset investor, and Masters told CoinDesk that ""tens"" of other companies are building with the technology.  As the number of enterprise-grade blockchain platforms grows, the advent of tools to simplify development could not only prove to give competing platforms an edge but a new way to generate revenue.  Masters said:  ""We've taken that same tooling, which our developers use, packaged it into something called a software developers kit, and are making that available to customers, progressively, more of them over time.""  DTCC collaboration  To get things started, Digital Asset is working with the DTCC to both refine the SDKs and teach the financial infrastructure provider how to use the technology.  As revealed on stage for the first time last week, DTCC chief architect, Rob Palatnick, described the technology as a way to ""construct smart contracts very cleanly,"" and with a wide range of potential use cases.  ""Now we're figuring out all the different business opportunities within the DTCC in support of the industry, where it might be best applied,"" said Palatnick at the DTCC Fintech Symposium.  For her part, Masters described the latest DTCC collaboration as ""a training process,"" one wherein they learned how to use the SDK and are now building example applications. Going forward, Digital Asset expects to learn from other early SDK tests so as to make it easier for other platform providers to interoperate with ASX and each other.  As the SDKs are ""polished"" through the DTCC work and the other unnamed projects, Master's expects to open up access even further.  ""Once that beta version is enhanced to the first release stage, which will be very soon, we will be opening that up to more customers,"" she said.  Connecting the world  Stepping back, Digital Asset's work is also part of an industry-wide effort to make enterprise blockchain solutions interoperable.  While Digital Asset has still not contributed its own work to the Hyperledger blockchain consortium, Masters serves as chair of the organization that is seeing increaasing interoparability between its members.  In addition, one of Digital Asset's largest competitors, distributed ledger consortium, R3, has open-sourced its own Corda platform and is preparing to make a number of live releases this year.  While Masters wouldn't discuss details about ongoing projects to help move more of the financial infrastructure to this nascent network of interoperable blockchains, she hinted at the potential benefits of doing so.  ""Today, CHESS and Austraclear are two totally distinct systems, different interfaces, and the opportunity would be for there to essentially be one,"" said Masters, adding:  ""Whether it's two instances of the same technology or a single instance of the technology that handles both, remains to be seen.""
