42402094,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3OOz,1540631742,The Double-Spend (What Bitcoin's White Paper Solved Forever),"Bill Barhydt is the founder and CEO of Abra.  This exclusive opinion piece is part of CoinDesk's ""Bitcoin at 10: The Satoshi White Paper"" series.      I remember reading Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin white paper for the first time a few weeks after it was released. I also remember the phrase that really grabbed my attention:  ""We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions…""  Of course, at the moment, I thought, ""Whoa, this can't be true. How can he possibly have a solution to the double-spend problem that is peer to peer?""  Up until Satoshi's innovation, the double-spend was the Achilles' heel of digital currency transactions – it simply wasn't possible for a digital system to prove two, or more, different people didn't spend the same digital money without the use of an intermediary. Despite advances in payment tech and services (the forebears of bitcoin already existed in technologies like DigiCash), all internet-based transactions still required a trusted third-party such as a bank, government or a credit card company.  Trust is a component of traditional payment schemes such as credit cards, ACH or bank wires, but involving third-parties into payments adds friction at the cost of time and money. These payment schemes all address the problem that fiat money is a paper-based bearer instrument that can only be transferred peer-to-peer in person, in the physical world. That assumes that paper money cannot be copied which, of course, it can be.  Solving the double-spend problem in the digital world makes near real-time commerce possible across the entire planet without regard to individual banking access, currency denominations or geographical location.  I think a large part of bitcoin's success is that it was the right idea at the right time. Between the financial crisis of 2008 and the fallout and subsequent crackdown following 9/11, banking regulations and best practices changed dramatically.  The result was that banks were becoming more and more inaccessible for those ""stuck"" in the cash economy — money transfer, checking and debit services, and obtaining credit became harder and more costly. This trend definitely impacted consumers, but it also created a higher hurdle for retail banking and financial innovation.  At the time of the bitcoin white paper's publication, I was building a company in the global mobile banking space. One of the biggest obstacles for growth was managing for all of the needs of different banking and regulatory requirements. Those requirements turned into constraints that proved untenable at scale.  So, in that context, solving the double-spend problem opened a massive technological frontier that allowed for experimentation and the design and deployment of a new financial sector. The true beauty of bitcoin is that it's based on open-source computer code and it's not owned or controlled by anyone. It is globally accessible in that the only requirement for participation in the new economy is an internet connected device.  Right in the bitcoin genesis block, Satoshi warns of bank bailouts. History leaves clues and those who don't understand history are doomed to repeat it.  A new economy  But, solving the double-spend problem wasn't just a milestone achievement in computer science. We are only 10 years in, but already we can see the far-reaching results of what a permissionless, distributed economy can look like – and what the impacts might be.  At this point, it's clear that bitcoin is not just a new feature set of the existing economy, but that it is fueling its own economy that will be built on different principles then what came before.  By eliminating the need for a centralized middle-man, bitcoin created the foundation for an entirely new banking infrastructure. By design, the infrastructure is incredibly secure. It was created as a protocol that allows other layers, apps, and services to be built on top of it.  And that's what we are seeing now the emergence of bitcoin service providers. Think about Lightning, Abra and LocalBitcoins as real examples.  Today, companies are building bitcoin services that range from exchanges, that serve as basic on and off ramps for transfers of value from legacy systems to crypto-based systems, and back again. New companies are using bitcoin to rethink credit and lending, while others are using the technology to make creating and securing a digital identity more straightforward.  Programmable money  It's exciting to think about all that has been made possible — and will be made possible thanks to bitcoin. Bitcoin gives us the ability to be build a future based on sound and programmable money.  In the future, bitcoin will make all kinds of financial innovation possible. At Abra, we are particularly interested in making money borderless (the company was founded to address this issue of near-free and private person-to-person money transfers).  We are also interested in how bitcoin will enable consumer asset financing in the form of pay-as-you-go style arrangements. Think of it as a hardware as a service model, which will not only be massive for technology adoption in developing economies but also create opportunities to tackle issues related to poverty and global public health.  We also foresee a world of micro-investing in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc., all made possible by bitcoin's programmable money attributes. Abra's synthetic assets are bitcoin collateralized contracts that make this type of micro-investing a reality today. Our goal is to democratize access to investment opportunities on a global scale.  The programmable facets of bitcoin make these ideas possible, and the greatest part is that the consumer or investor won't even need to know that they are utilizing bitcoin. Just like today's internet user doesn't understand the ins and outs of TCP/IP when they watch a Netflix or Youtube video, the bitcoin users' experience will someday be invisible and seamless.  Solving the double-spend problem helped move the internet one step closer to its initial promise of an open information network. By eliminating the need for trusted third-parties, bitcoin has become the foundation for the ultimate economic freedom.

42402088,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3OI6,1540628439,"Defending Decentralization, Like a Twice in a Millennium Chance","""We haven't had an opportunity like this in the past 500 years.""  That's Amir Taaki speaking on a closing panel at the Web3 Summit in Berlin Wednesday, and his statement was greeted with breathless applause by the audience. An early bitcoin developer, Taaki addressed a crowd of more than a thousand coders that had gathered to discuss ""Web 3.0"" – or the restructuring of internet infrastructures with an emphasis on decentralization.  ""Maybe the technological proposals that people are talking about are not very well grounded, but I do see a huge amount of young, idealistic people with a lot of capital,"" Taaki said, adding:  ""If we can form a vision and direct that energy, it could be an extremely powerful force.""  A concept which originated from ethereum co-founder and Parity Technologies founder Gavin Wood, Web 3.0 has evolved into a tech base that encompasses a wide range of decentralized technologies, ethereum and beyond.  Web 3.0 is intended to replace the existing online infrastructure with software that is decentralized from the start. To this end, much of the discussion over the three-day conference echoed Taaki's sentiment – that with the right combination of technology and vision, Web 3.0 can usher in a new era of digital emancipation.  And while that may sound idealistic – several attendees remarked that the event seemed to tip into naïveté at times – it was met with a wave of technological advances that reinforced this positivity.  ""It's different this time around, and we have a chance to use these tools in a way that empowers and protects people,"" Patrick Nielsen, CTO of Web 3.0 startup Clovyr, said. ""But it won't build itself, and just because the tools exist does not mean it's going to get used.""  Ethereum developer Lane Rettig echoed this point in an interview with CoinDesk.  According to him, the Web 3.0 community is at a crucial turning point. Either it succumbs to the classic ""rich get richer"" dynamics or the community takes ""the uncharted path"" of permissionless innovation.  ""But it's not something we get for free, and it is not something we get by default,"" Rettig contended.  What's more, such a vision requires careful coordination and an awareness of history, such as the failure of former technological movements that got co-opted by corporates. To this end, several moments during the conference reflected this idea in more cautionary terms.  For instance, ethereum developer Vlad Zamfir took the stage on Monday, saying: ""Expect every layer to be captured. Defend every layer.""  The 'protocol commons'  During the event on Monday, Harry Halpin, an academic and a former chairperson of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), gave some concrete examples of the risks currently facing the nascent industry.  According to Haplin, decentralized, open-source technologies have a historical tendency to fall prey to capture by corporations that implement the tech – thus further centralizing the Web.  Clovyr's Nielson seconded that, explaining that strategies – such as the so-called ""embrace and extinguish"" method – exist within corporations to allow them to take open-source software and reimplement it within their own systems (without so much as a thank you). And the tech, at that juncture, has been abstracted from its guiding principles and even be used for malignant ends, he said.  Zamfir specifically directed his warning about this process toward blockchain governance – where an economic elite can buy up crypto token ownership and divert the outcomes of a project.  According to Halpin, Web 2.0 technology underwent a corporate capture of its own, and the leaders of the projects ""lacked the backbone to push back and fight for users rights."" For example, Halpin drew attention to digital rights management (DRM) – a heavily criticized copyright-enforcing technology that led him to quit the W3C following its implementation as a Web standard.  To protect against such eventualities, Halpin proposed the notion of a ""protocol commons,"" an overarching blockchain governance body for ""certain things which are in everyone's best interest.""  This could include the development of Web 3.0 standards, as well as protection against software patents, Halpin said, adding that such governing bodies should avoid deifying specific people, a process that can create single points of failure for blockchain projects.  As Halpin argued:  ""We need to remove charismatic leaders, they are good at the beginning but they will become corrupt, or they will just go crazy, and either way it has the same impact.""  A surveillance machine  Privacy was another significant theme discussed during the summit. While much in the way of privacy tooling is in development within the cryptocurrency community, there are still plenty of unanswered questions.  Halpin called privacy protection ""the largest technological task facing the Web 3.0 community.""  He continued: ""Peer-to-peer and blockchain technologies are by design very hostile to privacy. There needs to be a lot of work.""  It was a notable trend at the summit, with many, like Halpin, warning that the use of peer-to-peer and blockchain technologies could result in a new surveillance machine – one that is even more threatening than the current Web as it exists today.  And that's because not only do technologies like ethereum reveal transactional data, but they also expose subtler computational activity which can be a concern, especially as it relates to smart contracts that deal with sensitive tasks like voting, location data, social media and identity.  As Zamfir explained:  ""Blockchain is a surveillance wet dream.""  Still, several talks touched on the privacy question, sparking a sense of renewed interest in developing the tools necessary to protect users and even developer information.  Advancements in zero-knowledge cryptography, ring signatures, mixnets, privacy-enforcing contracts and messaging were discussed, and even lower level cryptography that enforces privacy as a default, instead of needing end users to adopt.  One such project is Centrifuge, a financial supply chain startup that performs transactions apart from the ethereum blockchain in order to preserve their privacy, while still communicating with the blockchain by way of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  ""From a technical point of view, there's a huge improvement in terms of the technologies we can use to preserve privacy,"" CTO of Centrifuge Lucas Vogelsang said.  He added that the implementations of such technologies are ""just a matter of time.""  All about freedom  Still, the mood at the conference was generally optimistic. For example, several participants pointed to innovations particular to the blockchain ecosystem that could help overcome dystopian outcomes.  Zamfir, for instance, said that stable blockchain governance can be achieved using systems that enforce distributed control, incentive mechanisms and general fault tolerance.  Halpin echoed this point by stating that Web 3.0's main protection against the failures of former software movements is the novel economic models underpinning much of the industry.  ""Blockchain technologies have a fighting chance because they have an economic model built into how you use and work on the technology,"" he stated.  These economic models can help avoid outcomes like the onslaught of corporations that occurred in Web 2.0 and protect against the economic model underlying most of the internet – one that relies on user data and tracking as a primary business model.  Haplin continued:  ""You can see a new route of innovation on the Web that is not based on mass surveillance, that is based on decentralization, the respect for human life and new economic models based on payments.""  Speaking on the panel, Taaki reminded the audience of the importance of having a fixed ideological position to guide the Web 3.0 movement.  And while there are subtle disagreements about what the term ""Web 3.0"" actually means, Zamfir said in an interview that ideology can be boiled down to ""emancipation.""  ""It's not clear that it is going to be good for people's privacy, it's not clear that it gives people control, but it certainly gives people a lot of freedom,"" Zamfir told CoinDesk.  In a similar vein, according to Halpin, while we won't know for years as the technology and the industry around it unfolds, but it's worth the risk, given the underlying promise – freedom from corporate control – the technology stands for.
