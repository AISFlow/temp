42376431,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AZRf,1366040966,Is Bitcoin denting the economy?,"So how big an impact are bitcoins really having on the global economy? The latest market stats show the digital currency continues to show a growing influence on ""real"" money.  Among some recent stats:  As of April 2013, more than 11 million bitcoins have been mined so far;  The market cap for bitcoins now exceeds $1 billion (US), and briefly stood at a high of over $2.6 billion;  The value for a bitcoin reached a high of $237.57 in April 2013 before crashing to a low of $83.66 in a matter of days. While the value has recovered some, even the low far exceeds the $4.98 bitcoin value in early 2012.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MARKET,Dan Ilett,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/04/15/is-bitcoin-denting-the-economy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376425,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AZLN,1366031732,Can mining bitcoins harm the environment?,"A lot of attention has been focused in recent years on the energy and carbon footprint of the internet. The giant server farms that drive the world’s web activities need to get their power from somewhere and – as environmental groups frequently point out – that power still tends to come from sources like coal-fired power plants.  Compared to the mighty impacts of Google and Facebook, among others, you might think that bitcoin mining creates little more than a blip in global carbon emissions. However, as stats from blockchain.info show, bitcoin mining over a 24-hour period can currently consume almost $150,000 worth of electricity.  “The trade-off here is that as virtual value is created, real-world value is used up,” Bloomberg reports, adding that a day’s worth of bitcoin mining uses enough electricity to power some 31,000 US homes. “If the dreams of Bitcoin proponents are realized, and the currency is adopted for widespread commerce, the power demands of bitcoin mines would rise dramatically.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING,Dan Ilett,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2013/04/15/can-mining-bitcoins-harm-the-environment,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376423,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AZHb,1366031657,'Zerocoin' widget promises Bitcoin privacy,"Researchers at Johns Hopkins University are proposing a cryptographic extension to bitcoin that could enable fully anonymous transactions on the network. The extension, called Zerocoin, works – as NewScientist explains it – by “allowing bitcoin users to leave their coins floating on the network for someone else to redeem, on the condition that they can redeem the same amount of bitcoin, similarly left floating on the network, at an arbitrary time in the future.”  “Anyone can put bitcoins in, and anyone else can take one out,” Johns Hopkins researcher Matt Green says. “The anonymity comes from the fact that there will be a lot of people doing this. It makes a pool of hidden coins from which anyone can withdraw.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC,Dan Ilett,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/04/15/zerocoin-widget-promises-bitcoin-privacy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e62b9db4bada2e8d876500ea1d1a001e795f4fbf-1000x795.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
