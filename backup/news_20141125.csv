42426188,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjfZh,1416954046,Chamber of Digital Commerce Taps Matthew Mellon to Help Ease Bitcoin's Banking Woes,"The Chamber of Digital Commerce (CDC) has named bitcoin entrepreneur and banking family scion Matthew Mellon as its new honorary executive committee chairman.  Mellon, who will serve the Chamber on a volunteer basis, has long been involved in the bitcoin industry, having helped found ventures like Coin.co that focus on compliance solutions for businesses using bitcoin. A former finance committee chairman for the New York State Republican Party, Mellon comes from an American family known for its deep ties in both US banking and politics.  Mellon will focus on growing the level of bank involvement in the bitcoin industry, as well as supporting initiatives that enable conversations between the bitcoin space, members of Congress and financial industry leaders, according to the Washington, D.C.-based bitcoin advocacy group.  CDC president Perianne Boring told CoinDesk that Mellon’s efforts will help strengthen the industry as a whole, noting:  “The digital asset industry has serious challenges to grow and overcome, from Washington to Wall Street. Matthew Mellon has the experience, knowledge and network that bridges these worlds due to his years of work in the financial industry and as a leading voice in shaping public policy on digital assets.”  According to The Hill, Mellon said that he anticipates the organisation will be “the leading voice” for digital currency-related public policy outreach in Washington.  Targeting bitcoin banking barriers  The issue of banking resource shortages facing US-based bitcoin startups is well documented. Owing to a hesitation among banks to do business with a sector beset by regulatory uncertainties, some startups are unable to attract needed support mechanisms regardless of the promise they otherwise present.  The CDC, according to Boring, wants to push for more communication between the bitcoin and banking sectors to help alleviate some of these barriers.  This, she said, is where Mellon’s connections and expertise comes into play.  ""With Mr Mellon’s help through facilitating and open dialogue between banking regulators, the banks, and the bitcoin industry, the Chamber is ready to take on this challenge that will benefit the entire ecosystem,"" she explained.  Boring added that improving bitcoin's relationship with the banking sector will be one of the organisation's top priorities over the course of the next year.

42426183,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjfNh,1416949317,Derivatives Exchange Nadex Seeks CFTC Approval for Bitcoin Binary Options,"Derivatives exchange Nadex plans to offer bitcoin binary options to customers in the US next month, if its filing to register the options with the country's commodities regulator is accepted.  Nadex will offer daily and weekly bitcoin binary options contracts, taking prices from the bitcoin price index published by TeraExchange, a derivatives trading platform. Both Nadex and TeraExchange are regulated by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  The exchange is one of three 'designated contract markets' offering binary options in the US that are subject to CFTC oversight. It is owned by IG Group, a derivatives trading firm that is listed on the London Stock Exchange.  All-or-nothing options  Binary options are a type of derivative that allows traders to gain a fixed amount of profit if they are correct about the outcome of a particular proposition.  For example, the proposition might be that the share price of a particular company may be above $9.36 per share at 2:30pm on a certain day. Binary options are also known as ""all-or-nothing options"" or ""fixed-return options"", according to the CFTC.  Nadex chief executive Timothy McDermott said in a press releasehttps://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/nadex-plans-launch-bitcoin-binary-182923164.html that his firm's bitcoin binaries will give traders a way to gain exposure to bitcoin's volatility while limiting risk. He also said Nadex was offering the binaries in response to customer demand.  Nadex's corporate parent, IG, already offers bitcoin-linked products through binary options and contracts for difference (CFD). The firm offers daily, monthly and weekly binary options. It also sells a number of bitcoin CFDs.  A CFD is a derivative that allows traders to gain exposure to movements in asset classes, such as stocks, without owning the underlying asset. A company called First Global Credit offers CFDs linked to blue-chip technology stocks that can be bought with bitcoin.  Corporate parent IG courts bitcoin  Nadex's offering is for US customers while IG's products are for customers from the rest of the world, IG's public relations manager Chris Alfred said.  IG offered bitcoin binaries last April, taking prices from Mt Gox, according to trade publication Forex Magnates. Those binaries were discontinued a month later. The firm did not explain why the binaries were discontinued, when asked. The firm said only that the bitcoin binaries were relaunched in October because of customer demand.  ""We can see from search terms ... that demand to speculate on bitcoin is gathering momentum,"" Alfred said.  According to the CFTC, it has received ""numerous complaints"" about fraud linked to binary options trading platforms. It advises the investing public to be wary of identity theft, manipulated trades and inability to recover funds when dealing with unregulated binary options brokers.

42426185,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjfRh,1416944141,Bitspark Enters Hong Kong's Remittance Market With Bitcoin-Powered Solution,"Joseph Joel Bayaua is employed as a private driver by a family in Hong Kong. He has worked in the special administrative region for four years.  When Bayaua sends part of his earnings back to his family in Santiago, a city of 132,000 people in the Philippines' northern Isabela province, he selects either a Western Union money transfer or an inter-bank transfer. He usually ends up choosing Western Union.  Bayaua explained:  ""Both methods of sending money are basically the same. They just differ sometimes by the rate of their transfer fees, but I prefer Western Union over bank-to-bank transfer because it is more convenient for the recipient, for having numerous branches of Western Union back home.""  Bayaua now has a new option for sending money home. A startup called Bitspark is aiming its bitcoin-enabled remittance servicehttps://blog.bitspark.io/bitspark-the-first-ever-end-to-end-bitcoin-remittance/ at people like Bayaua and the estimated 164,000 Filipino domestic workers in Hong Kong.  Cheap remittances and diverse pick-up points  Bitspark promises lower transaction fees than banks and money transfer services, using bitcoin to cut costs. It's charging a 1% commission, which is significantly lower than the 3.5% it costs to send money to the Philippines from Singapore, a comparable remittance corridor that is tracked by the World Bank. The World Bank doesn't track the cost of remittances from Hong Kong to the Philippines.  Bitcoins's potential for slashing remittance costs has been hampered by the fact that receivers often have no easy way to convert the funds into fiat. Bitspark attempts to solve this by letting senders pay in cash and offering a range of diverse collection options for recipients.  The service has struck a deal with a Philippines remittance provider, Rebit, which handles conversion of bitcoin funds to pesos. The Rebit partnership means that Bitspark customers can send their funds to one of 20 banks in the Philippines, in addition to other popular collection spots like the Palawan chain of pawnshops.  ""We wanted to develop a system where people don't have to really know and understand bitcoin to use it,"" Bitspark's chief executive George Harrap said.  Harrap described a remittance process that largely keeps bitcoin hidden from the customer's view. Customers walk in to the Bitspark booth, on the first floor of World-Wide House, a popular hangout spot for Filipino workers on their days off. They hand over the Hong Kong dollars they want to send and fill in a form telling Bitspark where to send the money to. They then receive periodic text messages from Bitspark updating them on the movement of their money.  Bitcoin powers the transfers  What customers don't see is Bitspark monitoring bitcoin prices in Hong Kong dollars and pesos to find a favourable rate. When it finds a suitable price, it converts the cash it's been handed into bitcoin and sends it to Rebit, which in turn converts the coins into pesos for collection. The funds have to be ready for collection within 24 hours.  Harrap said Bitspark guarantees the amount a recipient would collect, so there is no risk of volatile bitcoin prices eating into customer transactions.  ""With cash-in, cash-out remittances, you don't need to know about bitcoin to use it. It just so happens to be the best rate around [so] people will use it. You don't need to explain [bitcoin] to them,"" he said.  Harrap wouldn't reveal how many transactions Bitspark has performed, saying only that his service has completed transfers for amounts ranging from HK$500–HK$10,000.  Adding more remittance corridors  Bitspark was selected for a Hong Kong government incubation programme in July. It gets up to HK$530,000 for being part of the programme, which is run by an organisation called Cyberport.  Harrap said he is raising more funding to expand into other remittance corridors. Mainland China and Indonesia are on top of his wishlist. According to Harrap, there is pent-up demand in China for a way to move money overseas, potentially skirting renminbi currency controls. Indonesians make up the second-largest group of migrant domestic workers in Hong Kong, with more than 150,000 Indonesians employed in the sector.  While Harrap has big plans for Bitspark in the remittance business, workers like Bayaua remain cautious about turning their hard-earned dollars into cryptocurrencies. But Bayaua's curiosity has been piqued.  ""I just didn't have an interest [in bitcoin] before, but now I am getting more and more curious about it ... it is a big help for us low-wage earners for providing us a cheaper means to send money back home,"" he said.

42426172,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjf3h,1416935099,Dutch Official: Bitcoin Transactions Probably Not Liable for VAT,"Bitcoin transactions will ""probably"" be not liable for value added tax (VAT), according to Jakob Kamminga, an official from the Dutch Ministry of Finance.  His comments were made during a debate on bitcoin and tax at VU University, Amsterdam, on Thursday.  This would mean that purchases with bitcoin will only be taxed on the goods and services side of the transaction, as is the case with fiat currency – not on both sides of the transaction, as is the case with barter transactions.  When asked about the statement, Kamminga's spokesperson at the Ministry of Financebito, Adriaan Ros, told CoinDesk:  ""During the presentation on Thursday, it was indeed indicated that the ministry is considering exempting bitcoin transactions from VAT.""  He indicated that this is based on the notion that such exemptions apply to payments instruments, which, if the term is interpreted broadly, may include payments in bitcoin.  Ros continued: ""It should be noted that these are preliminary and conceptual thoughts, however, that are yet to take shape and will need to be submitted through the usual routes, in which we will seek commentary from businesses and tax advisors. This happens by default in all policies in the field of taxation that are to be published.”  Reactions from the community  Although Kamminga's remarks did not represent official statements by the ministry, they are considered a step in right direction by many in the Dutch bitcoin community.  “This certainly seems like good news,” said Roger van de Berg, a tax lawyer at Baker & McKenzie and one of the speakers at the debate.  He explained:  “If bitcoin transactions would not be out of the scope for VAT purposes, as is the case in many countries outside [and within] the European Union ... VAT should be charged on any bitcoin that is purchased from a broker. Additionally, anyone who regularly pays with bitcoin could in this respect become a VAT entrepreneur, and would have to submit VAT-[liable] barter invoices to local merchants who accept payments in bitcoin.”  While it's still somewhat unclear whether the VAT exemption would only apply to private individuals or commercial activities undertaken by brokerages, exchanges and professional day-traders as well, it seems that the Ministry of Finance is also considering a VAT exemption for businesses.  Jouke Hofman, CEO of Dutch bitcoin brokerage Bitonic, was present at the Amsterdam debate. He indicated that he was pleasantly surprised by Kamminga's remarks, adding that the direction the tax authority seems to be heading in is great news for the Netherlands:  ""The Dutch government used to refer to outdated or even irrelevant statements which resulted in a lack of clarity. If the tax authority decides to go through with this proposal, it would not only stimulate the business climate in the Netherlands, but it would also create a clearer road for bitcoin payments for the Dutch.”  Benefits for the Netherlands  If Kamminga's remarks will indeed translate into actual policy, it would give bitcoin a VAT status in the Netherlands similar to the UK and Finland, and would certainly present a boon for the Dutch bitcoin community.  Consumer-focused projects in Amsterdam and Arnhem have launched to establish the country as a hub for bitcoin activity. The Hague's Bitcoin Boulevard project led the way back in March, with 10 merchants along two canal-side streets all accepting the digital currency.  The Netherlands is also shaping up to become a hotbed for bitcoin innovation due to the establishment of BitPay's European headquarters in Amsterdam, as well as the presence in the country of analytics platform BlockTrail, the aforementioned brokerage Bitonic, and the recently-opened exchange CleverCoin, among others.

42426180,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjfDh,1416927931,OKCoin and itBit Added to CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index,"Two more exchanges, OKCoin and itBit, have been added to CoinDesk's USD Bitcoin Price Index.  These additions will be live as of 15:00 GMT today, the 25th November.  Both exchanges see a significant amount of USD-BTC trade. OKCoin's US dollar trading volume over the 30-day period ended 11th November stood at 280,279 BTC. This figure amounts to 17.44% of the total volume on exchanges tracked by the BPI, according to data from Bitcoinity.org.  The same measure for itBit stood at 57,727 BTC, or 4.17% of total volume.  The other exchanges tracked by the BPI are Bitstamp, Bitfinex, BTC-e and LakeBTC, with a total volume of 1,327,182 BTC for the same 30-day period.  CoinDesk has adjusted its criteria for inclusion in the BPI. One of the conditions for inclusion is that bitcoin transfers into or out of the exchange must be completed within 24 hours. This criteria has been adjusted to allow bitcoin transfers to take up to two business days.  The adjustment allows a wider range of exchanges with a significant share of volume who meet the other criteria to be considered for inclusion.  To reiterate, the rest of the criteria include:  USD exchanges must serve an international customer base.  Exchange must provide a bid-offer spread for an immediate sale (offer) and an immediate purchase (bid).  Minimum trade size must be less than 1,500 USD (9,000 CNY) or equivalent.  Daily trading volume must meet minimum acceptable levels as determined by CoinDesk.  Exchange must represent at least 2% of the total 30-day cumulative volume for all of the exchanges included in the BPI.

42426174,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjf9h,1416922628,How Bitcoin Companies Keep Your Funds Safe,"When you store your bitcoins on an exchange, a gambling site, or in an investment site, you're placing a lot of trust in the company.  Personal wallet security with a relatively small amount of coins is one thing, but these sites store many more bitcoins than the average user, and are therefore prime targets for attack. So how do they protect your money?  Some, like the gambling site Seals With Clubs, use their own proprietary wallet technology, while others work with third-party services.  There are a variety of techniques and tools that companies can use to try and keep customers' cherished coins safe.  Cold storage  Cold storage is an obvious candidate, and this is what wallet provider and merchant payment gateway Coinbase does.  The company, which claims to store more bitcoin than anyone in the world, holds 97% of it offline, on a combination of USB keys and paper backups. The private keys on the USB drives are encrypted and stored in safe deposit boxes around the world.  Exchanges, too, rely on cold storage for their security. ""All of the funds held on Coinsetter are currently in cold storage,"" said the New York-based exchange's founder, Jaron Lukasiewicz. ""We have multiple tiers of cold storage, depending on a number of factors.""  A firm can manage its own cold storage, or it can get someone else to do it. Coinsetter stores around 50% of its funds in Xapo's bitcoin vault.  Xapo charges around 0.12% of the amount stored to look after enterprise bitcoins in its bitcoin vault, which consists of offline servers held in three locations in Asia, South America and the US.  The geographic distribution isn't just for physical site redundancy. It focuses on governments as an attack vector too. If the authorities in one jurisdiction try to seize bitcoins in a vault, then there would be two other locations still with their bitcoins intact.  Insuring against loss  Now, some cold storage services are complementing the technical advances in enterprise bitcoin storage with a financial one: cyber-insurance.  ""We were the first bitcoin company to obtain a cyber-crime insurance policy,"" said Coinbase co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong. ""This covers the bitcoin we store live on servers, and covers things like hacking, internal theft and accidental loss due to software bugs.""  Xapo's vault is insured by Meridian Insurance.  Another wallet supporting cold storage is Armory, an enterprise-class storage wallet developed by Alan Reiner.  John Velissarios, who recently joined Armory as chief information security officer (CISO), explained that the wallet has a special cold storage version designed not to connect to the blockchain, meaning that it doesn't publish transactions.  ""You can have a cold storage machine where it’s completely disconnected, with no connectivity to the outside world. You use that to release funds from your wallet,"" he said.  To take advantage of cold storage, enterprise users can prepare their bitcoin transaction on an Internet-connected computer, and then copy it to a USB drive and transfer the transaction to the offline cold storage computer, where they are signed.  ""You then copy it back onto the online computer and publish it,"" Velissarios continued.  Hardware security modules  Not everyone is enamoured by cold storage, however. Getting the funds out of that storage into a hot wallet can be time consuming, point out the method's critics.  ""People in a business need controlled access to funds,"" said Rodolfo Novak, co-founder of CoinKite. ""Every time you do cold storage you are mandatorily adding a human to the mix, so there is capacity for human error.""  In February, CoinKite launched a service storing private keys securely in hardware security modules (HSMs), which are not directly connected to the Internet, but instead function through a proxy that makes requests to the system. This provides what Novak calls 'warm' storage – securely-held keys that are accessible via an API.  ""The HSM is walled out of the standard Internet and it doesn’t ever expose its keys. So you can’t really practically get hacked,"" he said.  The HSM, which CoinKite built itself, has no web server. All it can do is support API requests from CoinKite's own web server. The module has to electronically sign that server before it starts up, which according to CoinKite co-founder Peter Gray means that there can be no malicious processes running on the server.  Users access the system using their CoinKite login credentials, which the company encrypts using a hashing algorithm, and can further protect themselves from being compromised using two factor authentication (2FA), via Google Authenticator, SMS, or even paper-based authentication.  When the user is authenticated, they can then access their cold storage via an API, which can be set to follow certain constraints, such as only allowing access from certain IP addresses, or limiting withdrawals to a set amount over a specified time period.  Multisignature storage  Multi-signature ('multisig') storage is one of the biggest developments in enterprise bitcoin security to date.  BitGo  , which CEO and co-founder Will O'Brien says focuses on solutions for enterprises and institutions, eschews cold storage altogether in favour of multisig.  O'Brien said:  ""Single-key cold storage is a dangerous, outdated practice. As an industry we need to end the cold storage ice age and adopt multisig, where you can make any number of keys 'cold' and have much stronger protections.""  Standardised a couple of years ago as part of BIP 16 (it was previously a non-standard feature in the protocol), multisig enables a sender to require more than one signature to confirm a transaction in what is known as 'm of ' signing.  In an m of multisig transaction, there are a total of available private keys to sign a transaction, and the wallet can be set up to require m of those keys to sign the transaction for the transaction to be executed.  The idea is to stop a single person from being able to compromise a wallet, by requiring another known party to co-sign that transaction.  BitGo, which claimed to be the first provider of multisig wallet functionality, features '2 of 3' signature confirmation, meaning that two private keys must be used to sign a transaction from a total of three available.  One of the signers in the scenario is the private local wallet, and one of them is the bitcoin private key. The third key is a backup key held on the Bitgo server.  Armory also announced fully decentralised mutisig capability in July. The firm offers multisig combinations up to m of 7, via independently-managed Armory wallets, without the use of a centralised site.  ""Banks typically have 2 of 3, or 3 of 6, but they generally won’t go past 7,"" said Velissarios, formerly a senior principal in Accenture's security consulting arm, with similar experience at PricewaterhouseCoopers. ""That’s why the enterprise space is very well suited for doing that kind of segregation of duties and providing those capabilities.""  Decentralised private key storage  Dencentralised offline multisig key storage is a significant advantage for some, including the CEO of one VC-backed bitcoin enterprise that has raised several million dollars.  ""I can make m of structures, where all of the private keys are created offline,"" said the CEO, who asked not to be named. ""Then, how I treat those is up to me. I could put one of them online, but the point is that the choice is mine.""  The CEO said:  ""There are also situations in which, for very small amounts of coin, I have a small hot wallet, where I keep $50 [in bitcoins]. That has its place.""  For those enterprises that do want more ms for their s, on 18th November, CoinKite introduced multisig for its hardware security module. The system offers m-of-15 transactions, and like Armory, doesn't require any of the keys to be stored on a central server, although it does offer five different options.  In the simplest storage option, CoinKite stores all keys centrally. Passphrase storage keeps the keys in the HSM, but encrypts them using the user's unique password.  The third option, 'invite others', enables users to invite other CoinKite users to be cosignees, who can then choose which option they want to store their key.  The fourth option, offline, uses an open-source tool created by CoinKite, which runs in the browser and generates multisig keys.  ""Some of the people who are cosigning on an account may want to use the HSM, so we support storing the multisig keys in the HSM,"" said CoinKite's Gray. ""At the same time, we also give them Javascript code to generate a key offline, on a computer that doesn't do anything else. So they can generate a key totally outside CoinKite.""  Finally, a fifth option lets users import keys from other wallets.  What's next for enterprise bitcoin security?  Wallet companies are specifically tailoring their solutions to enterprises. BitGo has an enterprise service with features like spending limits, alerts, and round-the-clock wallet monitoring. Over at Armory, Velissarios heads up the consulting services division.  What would really help bitcoin enterprises, though, is a standard for auditing security, that goes beyond classic datacentre security and PCI security standards, to reflect the unique nature of bitcoin storage and usage.  Nothing like this exists yet. Will an existing security standards body, or an independent institution in the bitcoin world, step up?

42426177,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjfBh,1416914689,Roger Ver Pledges $20k in Bitcoin to Antiwar.com Campaign,"Bitcoin entrepreneur and now philanthropist Roger Ver has doubled an earlier pledge of $10,000 in bitcoin to the activist site Antiwar.com, now promising to match up to $20,000 in donations from the public.  Ver  first pledged up to $10,000 in matching BTC donations to the ""non-interventionist"" campaign site in August, hitting that target in about a month, following over 300 individual contributions. The current campaign runs until 14th December.  Antiwar.com and bitcoin  Antiwar.com  began accepting bitcoin donations in November 2012, director of operations Angela Keaton told CoinDesk, saying ""But we had debated it for a while. We put a lot of thought into it. Still do.""  The site's audience tends to be early adopters with an interest in alternate currencies, she said.  The team had received a number of requests from readers who were mining bitcoin and wanted to use it to donate. Despite being grateful for the offers, Keaton said she remained sceptical of bitcoin for a while.  Antiwar.com had done some work with Drew Phillips of Bitcoin Not Bombs, who developed a system for accepting bitcoin that was so simple, integration became almost inevitable.  However, it was only when Keaton attended a bitcoin conference in San Diego last year, meeting some of its 2000 attendees face-to-face, that she was fully converted.  ""I saw these really amazing, brilliant young minds that understood instinctively what was wrong, they were very anti-authoritarian, very much decentralized, in governance and their approaches to life... I said 'my god, I do want to get this'.""  FBI surveillance  of some members of the Antiwar team ""certainly made us step back a little"" and highlighted the benefits of a currency that allowed people to donate discretely.  Ver's leadership in the bitcoin community, she added, and his well-known political views, mean campaigning for Antiwar.com is a natural fit.  ""Roger has spoken out a lot on anarchism, he's very outspokenly anti-war, and he's a leader in the bitcoin movement ... the way he talks about peace is really inspirational to a lot of us.""  Peace campaigns  The Antiwar.com website is a repository of news writing and opinion columns on non-aggression and pacifist causes, with up-to-date information on conflicts happening around the world.  The team also engages in other campaigns, calls to action and joins fellow anti-war coalitions, but due to the current situation with intervention against ISIS and controversy surrounding the defeat of the USA Freedom Act (anti-surveillance and monitoring), the team is trying to keep matters focused on news and commentary.  First launched during the Clinton era, Antiwar.com says it is ""devoted to the cause of non-interventionism and is read by libertarians, pacifists, leftists, greens, and independents alike"".  Bitcoin 'can stop war'  Bitcoin could aid the pacifist cause and stop war by removing governments' control over money and thus its power to fund conflicts, Ver has said in the past.  Its mostly-anonymous nature is often touted as being effective for donations to political causes, where some people would prefer not to associate their names with campaigns through credit-card transactions.  Ver, once a prolific investor in bitcoin companies, has turned his attention to activism and in recent times promoting bitcoin and several political causes.  In November 2013 he made a 1000 BTC donation (worth $1m at the time) to the Foundation for Economic Freedom (FEE) and he has previously donated for retweets of his link to the Free Ross Ulbricht campaign.  His recently created site Bitcoin Bounty Hunter promises bitcoin rewards for anyone who provides information leading to the arrest of notable bitcoin-world crimes, including the Mt Gox theft and the more recent hacks of his own and Satoshi Nakamoto's online accounts.
