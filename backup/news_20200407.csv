42404431,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdi59s,1586302205,Bitcoin Cash Approaches Milestone With First Halving Expected Wednesday,"UPDATE (April 8, 14:45 UTC): The bitcoin cash halving took place at 12:20 UTC Wednesday, full story here.      Bitcoin cash (BCH), the cryptocurrency that broke off from bitcoin (BTC) due to a heated community disagreement in 2017, is about to hit a blockchain milestone.      At block 630,000, expected to occur Wednesday morning Eastern time, the number of BCH coins created roughly every 10 minutes will fall by half, from 12.5 to 6.25. This will be the first halving for BCH in a sort of spectator sport some on Reddit say they will be watching as it unfolds on the blockchain.      The event is a foreshadowing of the same process happening on a larger scale on the BTC blockchain next month. BCH's market cap is worth about a twenty-fifth of BTC's.      See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      And if that's not enough halvings for you, bitcoin SV (BSV), the cryptocurrency that forked off from BCH after another bitter battle, will be halving just a day or so later.      The halving is seen as monumental since it highlights that the supply of the coin is fixed, a characteristic that differentiates BTC and its doppelgangers from most national currencies. Plus, it is arguably an important variable that led to bitcoin price increases in the past.      As such, one Reddit user said they bought beers to ""celebrate [the event] with family.""      The halving is happening earlier in the year for BCH and BSV partly because BCH temporarily had a different algorithm dictating how quickly the mining difficulty would adjust, which for a time sped up the block creation process.    Chance of attack    This slightly earlier date might have an unintended consequence.      BSV developer Brad Jasper said that in the short term this week's halvings will be ""bad"" for the respective cryptocurrencies.      He expects miners to temporarily leave for greener pastures. The main source of income for miners is the block rewards, which the halving will suddenly cut in half, making the chains less lucrative to mine. Meanwhile, BTC's block rewards don't halve for another month or so.      ""When BSV/BCH halve, they will both lose hash power, likely to BTC,"" Jasper said. In the long term, he argued, BSV will prevail due to its ""utility"" as a network that prioritizes transaction growth.      Norway-based Arcane Research agreed with the part about the loss of computing power in a report released last week, but went further. If hash power declines, Arcane said, the two splinter cryptocurrencies will be more vulnerable to 51 percent attacks, in which malicious actors gain control of the network.      But Jasper said he expects the situation will quickly change once BTC takes its turn and halves next month, since it will no longer be more profitable to mine than its namesake progeny.      That said, not everyone is convinced the halving milestone will lead to anything exciting or out of the ordinary.      Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver, known in the early days as ""Bitcoin Jesus"" for his evangelism before defecting to the BCH camp, said BCH's halving will be a ""non-event"" given BTC's halving history.      ""The last two were non-events, and I expect this one to be the same as the last two,"" he said.",NEUTRAL,BCH | BSV,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MINING | BSV,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/07/bitcoin-cash-approaches-milestone-with-first-halving-expected-wednesday,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cf298b62ce3ea25c09eceaa757d8b473da0ca57f-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404432,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdi5Cp,1586294117,Bitcoin Tracks Stocks Up to $7.4K Before Sliding Back to $7.1K,"Bitcoin trended higher along with many traditional markets Tuesday before changing direction and falling as U.S. stock trading closed.      Over the past 24 hours, bitcoin (BTC) fell more than than 1 percent as of 20:30 UTC (4:30 p.m. EDT). By contrast, ether (ETH) rose by 1.5 percent. Most of the other cryptocurrencies were up as well.      Notable asset performances on CoinDesk’s big board include lisk (LSK), up 1 percent, IOTA (IOTA) climbing 1 percent and litecoin (LTC), also up 1 percent. Assets trending downward include monero (XMR) down 3.5 percent and bitcoin SV (BSV), in the red 2.4 percent. All 24-hour price changes are as of 20:30 UTC (4:30 PM EST) Tuesday.      In the traditional markets, Japan’s Nikkei 225 index closed higher by 2 percent. This comes on the heels of the Japanese government introducing a nearly $1 trillion stimulus package Monday. Europe’s FTSE 100 ended the day up 1.3 percent. In the U.S., the S&P 500 closed New York’s trading day almost flat, down 0.16 percent.      After climbing from the $6,800 level Monday, bitcoin traded in a sideways $7,200-$7,400 range before dropping into $7,100 territory as the U.S. markets closed little changed.      For the year to date, bitcoin is up slightly, almost 2 percent as of Tuesday. Tepid as that performance sounds, it beats stocks. So far in 2020, the S&P 500 is in the red over 16 percent, the Nikkei 225 is down almost 20 percent and the FTSE is down almost 25 percent.      Bitcoin’s ability to ride traditional market rallies upward has been noticeable to traders lately.      “When the market has gone up, bitcoin has as well,” said Paul Ciavardini, head of trading for U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange itBit.      The correlation was less pleasant on March 13, when U.S. stocks suffered their worst day since 1987 and bitcoin dropped precipitously as crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX experienced a staggering $700 million in liquidations.      Further, while bitcoin has done well against equities, gold is a tough asset to beat. ""This market shows how bitcoin and gold are very different assets. Gold is a proven safe haven whereas bitcoin is correlated to risk assets at this time,” Ciavardini said.      The yellow metal is up 10 percent since the start of the year, even though it slipped a hair Tuesday, ending the session less than 1 percent down.      “People are liquidating positions and moving into gold, which has universal appeal,” said Ciavardini.      There’s some excitement among stakeholders that cryptocurrency is proving to be some kind of haven. Maybe not a classic safe haven like gold, but a haven nonetheless.      “Bitcoin may be looking particularly lackluster given the carnage in the equities market but it is easy to forget that it fell to just under $4,000 at the peak of the March bloodbath and has since rebounded all the way to $7,400,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at institutional brokerage BeQuant.      Traders like to see volatility because arbitrage exists in spreads on thinly traded exchanges versus over-the-counter desks, and money is being made on the exchanges.      “Market volatility is your friend, if approached correctly. Based on the current volatility levels there is plenty of upside yet to come,” said Vinokourov.      Of course, volatility-loving traders are much different than long-term cryptocurrency investors who just buy and hold. In that regard, bitcoin has been doing well versus stocks - can it continue to do so?      “In the short term, I expect the momentum to continue and the price will go further up,"" said Nemo Qin, an analyst at multi-asset brokerage eToro. ""The price could be driven by rising COVID-19 cases around the world, especially in the U.S.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/07/bitcoin-tracks-stocks-up-to-74k-before-sliding-back-to-71k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b2a547bbd534d04c5f7dd5c4373cb01e3b21f76-1012x716.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404423,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdi57u,1586289705,A New Ultrasonic Hack Can Exploit Your Siri,"Researchers are sounding the alarm about a new type of hack focused on smart digital assistants like the Amazon Alexa or Apple's Siri.      The hack, called a ""SurfingAttack,"" uses ultrasonic guided waves that are imperceptible to the human ear to communicate with a device through the voice assistant. It could be used to target Ring services with door deadbolts attached or move the temperature dial on your thermostat.      Security researchers who developed the attack say it enables multiple rounds of interactions between a voice-controlled device and attackers over relatively long distances and without the need for the device to be within sight. It could even be conducted through a heavy surface, like a table.      “Humans cannot hear anything, but the voice assistants will interpret these ultrasonic sounds as a voice command, and conduct certain operations because of it,” said Qiben Yan, an assistant professor at Michigan State University’s Secure and Intelligent Things Lab, who was the lead investigator on the project. “Sending the commands to the voice assistance, we can basically control the voice assistant. There's a lot of opportunities for this when people put their phones down on a table and leave them unattended.”      Yan said hackers could launch conversations with a victim's contacts, and depending on how connected their devices are, potentially control home devices, lock or unlock a car or front door, or alter the thermometer. Such attacks could also impact two factor authentication, by reading the security code sent via text back to the hacker.

Teams were given four areas to address: mitigating the world’s carbon footprint, peace and prosperity, designing sustainable cities and abating pollution and plastics.      Yorke E Rhodes III, the co-founder of Microsoft’s blockchain unit and a BSIC board member, said the incubator, which is in its fourth year, includes teams working on identity projects, affordable housing, incentives to clean up pollution and tracking carbon credits using tokenization.      “It’s run like a typical incubator where we have weekly deliverables for all of the teams.

42404430,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdi5Bq,1586285105,"Price Gap Between Sellers and Buyers Yawned During Bitcoin's March Sell-Off, Study Finds","As cryptocurrency markets crashed in March, bid-ask spreads on major exchanges widened dramatically, according to a report by over-the-counter (OTC) market maker B2C2.      The bid-ask spread is a classic indicator of market liquidity. It measures the gap between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept. The higher the spread, the harder it is to get a trade done, although those who manage to buy low and sell high make fatter profits.      The extreme dry spell in liquidity started on March 12, when prices plummeted across the crypto and traditional asset markets. The next day, bitcoin (BTC) dropped below $4,000, a 12-month low.      The bid-ask spread is measured in basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, and is usually a single-digit number. But during the tumultuous March 12-13 period, the spread for an order to buy or sell 25 bitcoin swelled to anywhere from 200 to more than 700 basis points on three exchanges, according to B2C2.      See also: Up 3%: Bitcoin Leaves S&P 500 Behind in Year-to-Date Recovery      It did not identify any of the platforms but said they have high volumes and cater to institutions. Since March, traders have been finding more arbitrage opportunities with heightened bid-ask spreads on exchanges like Bitfinex.      At one venue observed by B2C2, the spread ballooned to 10 percent, jumping out of the range of the provided chart.      To be sure, B2C2 has an angle here; it says in the report it was able to beat those exchange spreads 75 percent of the time.      It should also be noted that 25 BTC during this time was worth $100,000 to $200,000. Cryptocurrency exchanges, even the major ones, have thinly traded order books, which can always cause spreads to jump in volatile times.      “It’s still a tiny space with low liquidity,” noted Henrik Kugelberg, a Sweden-based OTC trader.      See also: Ether Rises to 28-Day High Amid Positive Sentiment for Coming ‘Eth 2.0’ Upgrade      Platforms like B2C2 combine various order books into one. Because of this, B2C2 would usually have a lower spread as traders flock to them for larger trades above five BTC compared to many exchanges where order books have lower liquidity.      B2C2 uses 100 BTC as another benchmark order size later in its report, and the spreads across exchanges for the March 12-13 period are even higher.      Because of overall low liquidity in crypto, B2C2 does provide traders with a needed service, connecting electronically into various exchanges and other liquidity providers.      “Trading with a professional electronic OTC desk comes with effective liquidity aggregation on a single connection and without the need to maintain balances on multiple exchanges,” noted Chris Dick, the B2C2 trader who authored the report.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/07/price-gap-between-sellers-and-buyers-yawned-during-bitcoins-march-sell-off-study-finds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f22281c55593e46c517a589cd32a57eb78a12e57-2560x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404415,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdi4z3,1586282734,Ready Layer One: Base Layer Protocols Team for Virtual Developer Event,"Togetherness is the message of Ready Layer One, a conference being planned for early May by the Web3 Foundation, Near, Cosmos, Tezos, Protocol Labs and Polkadot, all entities involved in building new blockchains designed to serve as the primary layer for distributed applications. Other blockchain projects may yet join.      The website describes the virtual gathering as follows: ""Think of it as the intersection between a hackathon, a conference, a MasterClass seminar and a vaguely anarchist festival for developers and builders of a decentralized web.""      Ready Layer One reflects a big-tent approach to blockchain gatherings, not unlike CoinDesk’s own Consensus, which is also going virtual this year. While most gatherings tend to be protocol-specific, Ready Layer One is taking a more agnostic approach.      The event is scheduled for May 4-6 and represents a combined effort to galvanize those already in the ecosystem to work on some of their shared problems together. CoinDesk recently reported on the idea of blockchain interoperability as a vision in which there will be ""one network, many chains.""      ""We think of blockchain technology as a public good to build a more open and innovative world, but it's unclear yet what technologies and set of trade-offs really works,"" Illia Polosukhin, a co-founder of NEAR, told CoinDesk.      Featuring two of the best-known interoperability projects, Cosmos and Polkadot, Ready Layer One reflects a real-world example of at least part of the industry betting that a rising tide will lift all boats.      Chris Ghent, from the marketing team at TQ, an organization working to advance the Tezos blockchain, told CoinDesk, ""We don't need people to commit to one thing but to commit to blockchains [in general].""      The target audience for the event is developers, and there's no cost to attend. Participants just need to demonstrate some skin in the game either by showing they've already done blockchain work or by participating in the testnets, hackathons, staking demonstrations and other open calls issued by the organizing protocols.      Ready Layer One’s organizers are trying to make the event as accessible as possible, so it will run on an extended schedule that should work fairly easily for people in the U.S. and Europe, though it might be a stretch for Asian participation. A 24-hour schedule just proved to be a bit more than they could handle operationally, the organizers said.      Also, the project will be run over a fairly new platform called Hopin, designed to imitate as much from real conferences as possible given the constraints of virtuality. In other words, it has features for ""mainstage talks,"" smaller interactive workshops and also networking.      The networking aspect relies on a Chatroulette-like feature where users will be randomly paired with another attendee in the networking pool. They can chat, exchange contact info and switch conversations whenever they feel like it. It eliminates the uncertainty of approaching strangers and the frustration of breaking into crowds around well-known people.    Hands on    ""The founding projects, they all have stuff that's ready to go,"" Zaki Manian, co-founder of a Cosmos-oriented staking company called Iqlusion told CoinDesk. ""You can build with it and play with it right now.""      TQ's Ghent sounded a similar note, saying the pitch really is to draw in what he called ""qualified tinkerers.""      ""If I want to build something on Cosmos, and Cosmos dies, can I build a similar thing on NEAR?"" Manian said by way of example. The answer, he thinks, is yes, and if Ready Layer One can show that to developers, then those devs will see less risk in choosing to build on any of the Layer 1 networks.      There's also going to be an element of dealing with cross-chain challenges, according to Ashely Tyson, who is helping to organize the event on behalf of the Near protocol.      ""There are a few topics that cross all of the protocols that we're going to be compiling themed workshops and mainstage talks around,"" Tyson said. Before the world shut down, Near had been organizing small gatherings to discuss some of these issues, such as standards for using existing open source technology (like WebAssembly) in a blockchain context and efficiently keeping interoperability in mind.      There will be some updates on these topics and also calls for developers to get involved in research and development that should benefit all the projects.      Blockchains have potential but no one disputes that it's not yet fully realized.      Poloshkin spoke to frustrations that the technology is not really ready to help in the current crisis. ""The technologies we are all working on have an ability to help and change things in the coming months and years. But we are still far from the state where it can be used by the mass market,"" he said.    Weird year    Blockchains may be virtual but meeting up digitally at scale is new in this space.      Both Manian and Ghent noted that much of the industry's calendar has been defined by conferences and physical gatherings, and no one knows when the next big crypto event will actually happen IRL. It makes for a ""strange time,"" as Ghent put it.      ""Given all things COVID, we're actually looking to digitize a whole lot of our go-to-market [strategy],"" Ghent said. ""Not just in the COVID world but knowing that a lot of devs are digital-forward and online.""      That said, doing a virtual conference is a whole new endeavor and one without well-established norms, a point Manian is well aware of.      ""I think for a lot of teams it's a lot less scary to try to do this with a group of protocols, rather than to try to do it on your own,"" Manian said.",POSITIVE,NEAR,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | TECHNOLOGY | XTZ | NEAR,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/07/ready-layer-one-base-layer-protocols-team-for-virtual-developer-event,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/37ce3c39f9468a078301dd7fd7528196096eadf5-1500x845.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42404414,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdi4y4,1586282206,Your Crypto Startup Needs a Recession Strategy,"Imagine we are venture capitalists and succeed in raising $30 million. Let's say in this world there are two types of VCs: (1) ones with a network, skillset and timing, and luck enough to generate real returns; and (2) ones whose attributes are insufficient for beating even the most conservative benchmark. In reality, 10 percent of VCs will be in category (1), and 90 percent will be in category (2).      We won’t know ahead of time which type of investor we are. Only after seven years (the typical investment timeframe), do we start to realize and mark to market our investment bets. Given human bias and nature, of course, we are convinced that we are in the good category (1), and self-confidence is high.    Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is Global Fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his Future of Finance newsletter.    Since there are no market prices, proxies are used. Whenever one of our companies raises a follow-on round (e.g., Series A), the paper valuation from that round trickles down into our valuation models, which then trickles down into performance reporting, and is then presented to limited partners (LPs). Since the entire value chain has an information problem, not knowing what anything is really worth, everything *could* be worth a lot. But on paper, our returns look correct. They are generating 25 percent IRR every year in valuation gains.      See also: Lex Sokolin: Software Ate the World, Here’s How It Eats Finance      The stated investment strategy is to have lots of bets that have some probability of returning a massive order of magnitude return, with nearly all others failing out. So a single Binance among 30 other exchanges is just fine. Also, we will want to leave about half of the cash in the portfolio for follow-on investments, so that if some of our companies start to de-risk and show signs of success, we can add more money into them.      Since the mark-to-market moment comes after we've invested our fund, and we believe that our fund has good underlying performance, we just can't see yet. So we will raise as many new investment vehicles as the market permits to stack management fees and our personal reward.      Now let’s apply a shock like coronavirus. All of a sudden our whole portfolio is in distress. If you run a public equities fund and value fell by 30 percent, you experience massive fund outflows immediately. People are turning off risk and going into cash, full stop.      But with venture capital, our investors (i.e., the limited partners) have a harder time both seeing the price collapse, as well as pulling money out. So the first issue right now is that VCs are trying desperately to sanity check their portfolio. Of those 30 projects, which are most likely to have the cash position to weather the crisis? And which are most likely worth supporting through it?    Entrepreneur POV    If you are an entrepreneur trying to raise money, understand that pretty much every single one of the venture investments the portfolio manager already made is raising again. This means that new deals may be interesting, but they are far less interesting than preserving the valuations of the most promising companies already held.      Because if you are actually forced to mark-to-market on those venture portfolios, many will lose 20 to 50 percent immediately. This is not in the self-interest of the VC, who would like to raise a follow-on fund and keep accruing management fees. Thus capital reserves will be used for internal bridges and bailouts.      To that end, see the watershed moment of SoftBank pulling out of its $3 billion commitment to purchase WeWork shares. Or the general sense that VCs are starting to act ""badly"" and pull term sheets from companies. Or the comments that VCs will not be able to raise very much over the next year to continue funding new companies. Well, yeah! All our stuff is on fire and reputations are in tatters!    In this coming period, spoils will go to companies that generate their own cashflow and balance sheets without external funding.    The other important thing to keep in mind: VCs don't necessarily hold all the assets they raised in a bank account. They have what are called ""capital commitments"" from other institutional investors, like endowments and pensions (e.g., Harvard). That endowment runs an asset allocation with lots of things in it, and most of those things are down, or being sold into cash. So the endowment just may cancel, or somehow reverse, its capital commitment. LPs may bail on commitments, preferring to litigate rather than give you the money, which will cost them less in the end.      In short, there is a shakeout coming in venture capital. The pandemic shock is causing an economy-wide mark-to-market event in private assets, caused by the need of large institutional managers to rebalance and take risk off. There will be less capital flowing in fintech and crypto VC ecosystems in the next 18-24 months.      The same deleveraging is happening for entrepreneurs. Tripping from one pot of growth funding to another put of growth funding, with value underpinned by a metric that doesn't lead to cash flow, is now a suicidal strategy. See the defunding of WeWork. You need a business to say that you have a business. While investors sort out their own houses, the shrewd entrepreneur has a chance to make a killing against less disciplined competitors.    Have a recession strategy    In the crypto markets, I would figure out how to provide services adjacent to industry leaders like Binance and Coinbase and their businesses. Watching Binance try to snap up CoinMarketCap for as much as $400 million and launch a debit card suggests to me two things.      In this coming period, spoils will go to companies that generate their own cashflow and balance sheets without external funding, and second, companies with large user footprints will flourish, while the rest will be integrated as features or liquidated. Delivering a large audience and a data engine to a large trading value is clearly synergistic. Building risk management, analytics, staking, and other neo-banking and roboadvisor features also makes sense.      If we look at the parts of the ecosystem that generate cash flow in a downturn, it still largely comes down to trading and mining. These are the core engines of the crypto economy, and will thrive as the traditional monetary system thrashes itself. One step down in total addressable market size are the media businesses, enterprise blockchain, digital assets, and developer tooling. Lots of folks are building things and talking about them, and that will continue under economic pressure as well. Companies that are taking a more niche bet will need to find a way to add value to revenue for the industries mentioned above. It is right to show conviction under pressure, but you have to be nimble and accurate.      See also: Lex Sokolin - Libra Wanted a Currency, All We Need Are DeFi’s Open Payment Rails      There are lessons from wider fintech. From neo-banks to payments to roboadvisors, we will see consolidation and downward valuation pressures. Automation software and digital experiences are likely to become more important than ever. For example, digital wealth managers have seen a surge in account sign-ups as people stay home. The same is likely to happen to companies like Chime and Square as they try to become the vehicle for universal basic income (I mean stimulus) in the U.S.      The SME and mortgage sectors will need smart digital providers, connected to digital personal and corporate identity. The more transformational projects will be hard to commercialize in the short term, but to me that doesn't mean they aren't worth doing in the long run, especially when others are fearful. I hope to see a lot more cross-pollination between these fintech needs – especially in payments and lending – and the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector. We have an opportunity to hide the complexity of blockchains behind the use-case that millions of people desperately need, likely supported by government grants and support.

42404429,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdi5Ar,1586277277,"Blockchain Bites: China's Commitment, Sanctions Evasion and a Look at Bitcoin's Core","Experts are aligned in thinking the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is using a billion-dollar cryptocurrency war chest to bust sanctions.      The pieces of the puzzle are falling into place, said Priscilla Moriuchi, head of nation-state research at Recorded Future, regarding the Hermit Kingdom's crypto-funded, trade-based, money-laundering networks. While the complete picture is still obscure, it appears North Korea is able to fund off the radar ship-to-ship transfers using freshly minted cryptocurrency it earns from exchange and ransomeware attacks, among other means.      You're reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they're significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk's newsletters here. Here's the story:    Top Shelf    Sanctions evasion The Democratic People's Republic of Korea's $1.5 billion cryptocurrency war chest is likely used to evade import and export sanctions, experts agree. Evidence documenting this cross-border movement is still mounting, though one reliable way for the DPRK to circumvent sanctions involves ship-to-ship transfers, the process of moving cargo from one ship to another in the open sea rather than at a port. The nation’s increased crypto-jacking activity, or using malicious bots to surreptitiously mine cryptocurrencies mean that these also points in this direction, as “newly mined cryptocurrency can be used to facilitate sanctions-evasion activity,” a U.N. report reads.      China's commitments “The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) will undoubtedly further its research and development of the national digital currency with enhanced top-down design,” the bank said in at a high-level conference. The unequivocal language used indicates a firmer stance on the project than before.      Teddy Fusaro, chief operating officer at Bitwise Asset Management, argues China is winning the misinformation war. After reeling from a novel coronavirus outbreak, the regional superpower is now exercising soft power, and authoritarian means, to rewrite the outbreak narrative.      Core code The privacy and scaling upgrade Schnorr/Taproot bitcoin code update is moving closer to its implementation. The update will allow for a number heretofore impossible projects, by bundling together several different proposed technologies. Alyssa Hertig, CoinDesk contributor, breaks down what these changes are and what they mean for bitcoin’s future.      Regulatory hurdles Risk-averse German banks are unwilling to take on crypto firms as clients, despite regulation and guidance from the nation’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority. “There is no legal reason why banks wouldn’t offer bank accounts but they are hesitant because they don’t understand the business,” said Matthias Winter, partner at Eversheds Sutherland Germany, a firm working directly with German regulators on how the law should be enforced.      Alternatives are presenting themselves. Coinhouse, an exchange, has become the first crypto company to be registered with the Financial Markets Authority (AMF). The registration means Coinhouse now has a shot at getting banking services in France, which could give the firm cheaper services than the German bank it currently works with.      Helping hand Helperbit, a blockchain-based disaster management platform, has raised approximately $31,800 in bitcoin donations to help defray the cost of building emergency medical centers in Italy. “We are happy to have turned the received donations into a tangible aid. We are excited to have received so much help from the bitcoin community,"" said the president of the Colli Albani Committee, Bruno Pietrosanti.      Blockchain can help for more than just donations, the World Economic Forum says. According to a recently published paper, distributed ledgers and digitization can help supply chains survive crises like COVID-19.

Private Messaging    A to Zoom alternatives Video conferencing app Zoom has become popular by necessity, growing 200 fold since December, despite existing security practices that were found wanting. Reports of Zoombooming and a wanton disregard for personal data have many in the crypto space looking for alternatives to host video chats with colleagues and family members. CoinDesk’s security reporter Ben Powers identifies Jitsi and Whereby as strongly encrypted alternatives.      Careless Whisper The blockchain-based messaging app Whisper pushed out a code update sacrificing privacy for scalability, reports Decrypt.    Market Intel    Notch in the ether Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, has recorded its biggest daily gain in over 20 days. Industry experts said the rise can likely be attributed to growing confidence in a planned system-wide upgrade known as Eth 2.0, slated for July 2020, which promises higher transaction throughput and a new security model under proof-of-stake (PoS).      Decoupling? Up 3 percent, bitcoin left the S&P 500 behind in a year-to-date recovery. Bitcoin clocked a 3.5-week high of $7,459 early on Tuesday, meaning the cryptocurrency was up 4.2 percent from the yearly opening price of $7,160. Since then prices have fallen back slightly, though the cryptocurrency is still ahead of Wall Street’s equity index, which is still down 17.5 percent for the year, despite a notable rally.      Halving report In May of 2020, bitcoin is expected to undergo its third “halving,” a programmed supply reduction that has in the past coincided with a strong run-up in the bitcoin price. In this paper, we explain what the bitcoin halving is, why it matters and why the market is so focused on this event.

42404422,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdi53y,1586276821,"How to Get Money to People in an Emergency, Fast","Frances Coppola, a CoinDesk columnist, is a freelance writer and speaker on banking, finance and economics. Her book “The Case for People’s Quantitative Easing” explains how modern money creation and quantitative easing work, and advocates “helicopter money” to help economies out of recession.      The responses of governments to the coronavirus pandemic have been extraordinary. Governments around the world have enacted emergency legislation to protect people from loss of income and keep businesses alive as far as possible. The U.S. government, for example, is handing out free money to every American and providing cheap loans to businesses. But although the principle of just giving people money appears simple, delivering that money has run into a problem all too familiar to Bitcoiners. Governments have encountered a scaling problem.      The first sign of the scaling problem appeared when people started losing their jobs. U.S. government websites crashed due to huge spikes in new claims for unemployment insurance, and in the U.K., people waited for hours on the phone to speak to an adviser. Again, this would be familiar to Bitcoiners. Making people wait, and wait, and wait, is how cryptocurrency exchanges manage demands for withdrawals that they can’t immediately meet.      See also: Frances Coppola - How Central Banks Could Use Digital Cash to Deliver Universal Basic Income      Despite valiant attempts to create faster second layers, the solution to Bitcoin’s scaling problem ended up being surge pricing: as average wait times for settlement increased, people who wanted their money quickly paid ever-higher transaction fees. But people desperate to get some money to pay the rent when their job has disappeared overnight can’t pay high transaction fees, and they can’t wait a long time for their money either. The de facto scaling solution adopted by Bitcoin won’t work for them.      So, instead of overwhelming websites and advisers by forcing millions of people to claim unemployment insurance all at once, why not just give everyone money? Under the new CARES Act, every adult American will receive $1,200, and every child $500. Sounds like a simple solution, doesn’t it?    How they do it    If only it were. The original proposal was to send everyone a check. Check production is an intensely manual process: The checks have to be printed, signed, envelopes have to be addressed, the checks have to be put in envelopes, mailed… I tried to work out how long it would take the Internal Revenue Service to send checks to 331 million people and gave up when the answer started to run into years. And then the checks have to be physically presented at banks. There would be lines a quarter mile long outside banks, not to withdraw funds but to put them in. And how long would it take the banks to process these checks?      Fortunately, the IRS isn’t sending checks to every American. It is distributing funds electronically to 60 million households. If you have filed a tax return and the IRS already has bank deposit details for you, you will get your money automatically. But even so, your money may take a week or two to arrive. After all, electronic funds transfers have to be processed. And the IRS isn’t used to distributing money on this scale.    A brilliantly simple idea – give money to everyone – has become a complex, inefficient and intrusive mess.    But everyone else will get checks. Admittedly, these will go to households not individuals, but even so, people may have to wait a long time for their money. The IRS is expecting to send out 100 million checks at a rate of five million per week, starting on April 24, so the last round of checks won’t go out until September. It’s not clear how long banks will take to process these checks. So if anyone is relying on these checks to pay their rent or buy food, they will be homeless and starving by the time the money arrives.      And if you are one of the estimated 10 million Americans who don’t file tax returns, this money comes with strings attached. Unless you receive Social Security or veterans’ benefits, you will have to tell the IRS you exist by filing a null tax return: How long it will take the IRS to process all these new tax returns from people it has never heard of remains to be seen. You will also have to give them either your mailing address for a check, or your bank details. So the government will end up knowing a whole lot more about you than it did before. And if you don’t have either a permanent mailing address or a bank account, it’s not clear how you can claim the money at all.    How we could do it    In short, a brilliantly simple idea – give money to everyone – has become a complex, inefficient and intrusive mess. I believe the crypto and fintech industries could come up with something much better than this.      Firstly, it really is time to ditch checks. It’s hard to imagine a less efficient way of getting money to people than mailing them pieces of paper that have to be presented at a bank.      Secondly, it’s time to ditch banks. There is no need to force people to have bank accounts. All they need is a wallet.    An estimated 96 percent of Americans have smartphones. That’s more people than have bank accounts.    There is also no need for people to have to tell the IRS anything about themselves. If we agree that everyone should be able to access money in a crisis with no questions asked, then all that people need to give the IRS is their wallet address. Their privacy can be maintained – though of course, politics being what it is, the government might still insist that there is some kind of additional identity check, perhaps to stop undocumented immigrants from claiming.      But eliminating checks and banks won’t be enough to get money to people fast. Even when the gateway to it is streamlined, a single payments architecture is always prone to gridlock at peak times. Bitcoin’s surge pricing isn’t an option for governments, and nor is making people wait for weeks or months to receive their payments. But the crypto industry learned in 2018 that the best way of dealing with capacity problems in a payments architecture is to diversify. Multiple payment rails spread the load, ensuring everyone gets their money quickly and cheaply. That’s a lesson that the U.S. government needs to learn.      See also: Catherine Coley - The US Should Use Stablecoins for Emergency Coronavirus Payments      These days, by far the fastest and most efficient way of delivering money is via smartphones and mobile devices. The U.S. government should simply provide a general portal to a wide range of payment delivery mechanisms. Visa and Mastercard are easily capable of handling these payments, especially as their normal transaction volumes have fallen significantly due to the shutdown. But the government should also work with platforms such as Venmo, Zelle, Square Cash, Paypal, Apple Pay and Google Pay [Chime, a San Francisco fintech startup, says it's piloted a way to distribute the $1200]. And it could also offer payment in cryptocurrency as an option. Let’s have a mobile money explosion, and let people choose how to receive their money.      Using smartphones and mobile devices to deliver stimulus money could also potentially reach more people than checks or digital deposits. An estimated 96 percent of Americans have smartphones. That’s more people than have bank accounts.      I hope it’s not too late to set this up for the current pandemic.

42404404,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdi1iN,1586276573,"Private Companies Could Play Role in Digital Currency Issuance, Bank of England Says","The Bank of England (BoE) is open to the possibility private cryptocurrencies may have a role in the future of money.      In a webinar hosted Tuesday, BoE analysts working on the U.K.'s central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiative said there was a distinct possibility that private companies could play a much larger part in the issuance and distribution of money.      Although the BoE has already said bitcoin (BTC) and other similar cryptocurrencies don't meet the necessary criteria to be considered money, CBDC analyst Ben Dyson said, ""that doesn't mean that it's impossible for somebody to improve upon that technology and create something that much better fulfills the qualities of money.""      ""We've seen proposals over the last year from large technology firms, for example, to build payments systems and crypto-assets that could function more as stable money,"" he said.      Although they might introduce new risks into the monetary system, Dyson said private currencies could work alongside any future CBDC initiative if they offered real utility.      Dyson did not mention the Libra project that was unveiled last June, but the Facebook-led plan is to build a stablecoin based on a basket of fiat currencies. Since its announcement, it has since seen a tsunami of pushback from regulators and politicians around the world.      ""If these proposals are responding to a real need – for example, some weakness in the existing payments system, or some category of users that are not being served by the existing payments systems – there may be a role for the public sector in addressing some of that need, as well as just leaving it to the private sector,"" Dyson explained.      See also: ‘Crucial’ for Central Banks to Consider Digital Currencies: Bank of England Exec    Stablecoin skepticism    The BoE's views about private currencies are distinct from those from other central banks, which have talked specifically about Facebook's currency initiative as well as the broader space.      In February, U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard said the motivation for researching CBDCs was to counter privates currencies, such as libra, that could exist outside U.S regulation. It's widely believed China accelerated its plan for a digital yuan in the face of a possible rival from Facebook.      French and German officials have also voiced their opposition to libra and said such initiatives might not even be legal in their jurisdictions. Barely a month ago, the Canadian central bank governor said it would only issue a CBDC in order to compete against a potential threat like libra.      See also: 4 Reasons Central Banks Should Launch Retail Digital Currencies      This isn't the first time the BoE has adopted a more conciliatory approach to libra. In August, then-governor Mark Carney said that although libra would have to be heavily scrutinized, the concept of private companies issuing their own currencies was ""intriguing.""      But as the BoE analysts also emphasized in Tuesday's webinar, any future digital currency – including a prospective CBDC – would need to comply with tight data privacy standards. ""The key thing for the Bank of England is to make sure if we were to do a CBDC – and it is an if – it would absolutely respect people's rights to privacy,"" said Tom Mutton, the BoE's fintech director.    Privacy focus    Like much of Europe, the U.K. adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) – which will stay in place after the nation leaves the European Union – that essentially gives users ownership rights over their own personal data. Companies such as Facebook, which has a poor record on privacy, now have to seek user permission before they can use any of their personal data.      It's likely the BoE would hold any currency issued by centralized firms like Facebook – which saw its reputation slide during the Cambridge Analytica scandal – to the same data privacy standards as a prospective CBDC.      See also: How Libra Failed, and How It Could Succeed in 2020      A British parliamentary committee previously highlighted Facebook’s privacy record, saying it may probe libra over whether it can adequately protect the financial data of billions of users.      ""CBDCs would have to be designed to be compliant with these [data privacy] regulations, at the same time we want to ensure that the users of CBDCs can be confident that privacy in their payments and what data is shared and on what basis and with whom,"" Dyson said Tuesday. ""It's unlikely that a [CBDC] could be completely anonymous but we would like to design something that respects users' privacy and gives people control over their data.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/04/07/private-companies-could-play-role-in-digital-currency-issuance-bank-of-england-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e97759b7b719b3adcaa14af8f6e2638704b8e2b6-1500x1047.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404408,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdi1nI,1586271752,First Mover: Bitcoin's Back in the Black for 2020,"Bitcoin (BTC) traders are used to the mood swings that come with extreme price volatility. They were elated when prices shot up 30 percent in January, the best start to a year since 2013. They were alarmed and unsettled when the spread of the coronavirus sent prices for the oldest and largest cryptocurrency plunging as low as $3,850 in early March from about $10,200 just a month earlier.      Now, volatility is returning in a positive way, prices are going up and enthusiasm is returning to digital-asset markets. Bitcoin has nearly doubled in price since hitting the March low, and a 7.8 percent rally on Monday brought the cryptocurrency back into the black for 2020. As of early Tuesday, prices were up 4.25 percent on a year-to-date basis.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Clawing back to that threshold represents a milestone for bitcoin, since the latest coronavirus-triggered sell-off was one of the cryptocurrency's biggest crises since it was launched in early 2009. Holders are hoping the recent price recovery will attract the notice of mainstream investors, in turn driving more demand for bitcoin. But it also could prove a boon for the marketing efforts of hedge funds and other investment firms that specialize in digital assets, as they seek to woo new institutional clients.      Leaving aside the question of whether bitcoin is a safe-haven asset like gold or Swiss francs, most investors in any asset class would likely be thrilled, given what's happening right now in the economy, just to get back what they've lost since the start of the year. That can't be said for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks, which remains down 18 percent in 2020 despite its spectacular rally over the past few weeks.      The positive year-to-date performance just bolsters the pitch for bitcoin in the current environment; many investors in both digital-asset and traditional markets say inflation will likely follow the trillions of dollars of fiscal and monetary stimulus deployed just in the past month by governments and central banks around the world. And bitcoin, sometimes referred to as ""digital gold,"" is bought by many investors as a new-economy way of hedging against inflation.      Here's how San Francisco-based Bitwise Asset Management put it in an April update:      ""We are in unprecedented times, seeing anomalous and unexpected developments in financial markets, including gold, and witnessing extraordinary fiscal and monetary responses to the coronavirus pandemic. In such an environment, a small allocation to crypto in a diversified portfolio seems increasingly prudent. We are hearing this from clients, and seeing it in our inflows. If considering a small allocation to crypto has been on your to-do list, now may be one of the best possible times to prioritize figuring out your stance.""      And bitcoin's outperformance is becoming a regular thing. Over 2019, bitcoin surged 94 percent. That was roughly triple the returns the S&P 500 notched during a banner year for the stock index. In hindsight, it may have been the bull market's final push.      Michael Novogratz, a former Goldman Sachs executive who's now CEO of the cryptocurrency investment firm Galaxy Digital, told CNBC last week he was fielding calls from investors who have never dipped into the nascent market. According to Novogratz, they all have the same request: ""Tell me about this bitcoin.""      Blockforce Capital, a cryptocurrency investment firm in San Diego, said Tuesday in an emailed report its Multi-Strategy Master Fund lost 14 percent in March, while quickly noting (at the top of the document) performance was essentially flat for the year. While the firm said that ""cryptocurrencies will remain volatile and widespread institutional adoption will take a very long time,"" confidence remains.    ""We believe that we can achieve superior risk-adjusted returns that are uncorrelated to the other investments that so many of our clients already own."" Blockforce Capital    An interesting development over the past week is just how many highly respected old-line Wall Street analysts – even those who don't follow bitcoin closely – are now predicting a pickup in inflation.      Rich Bernstein, a former Bank of America chief U.S. equity strategist who now runs his own advisory firm, told Barron's on April 3 he sees stagnation ahead for the economy, if not ""stagflation"" – where low or flat growth comes at a time of rising consumer prices and high unemployment.      ""When you think about the amount of stimulus that is being put in the system worldwide, it seems to me that's a reasonable proposition that you can have more inflation than people think,"" Bernstein said.      And there's Michael Wilson, a Morgan Stanley equity strategist, who wrote in an April 5 report that ""there are literally no governors on the amount of monetary or fiscal stimulus that will be used in this fight."" He continued:      ""Not only are we likely to get the largest peacetime fiscal deficit in history, but the stimulus targets the parts of the economy with a higher propensity to spend. Such a dramatic shift in U.S. fiscal and monetary policy relative to other regions should lead to a materially weaker dollar.""      President Donald Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, told CNBC that not only is he in favor of selling government bonds to ""raise money for the war effort,"" but that ""you have fiscal policy working with monetary policy."" The takeaway is, as authorities respond to the pandemic, the U.S. central bank can be called on to provide whatever financing is needed for whatever spending programs the government pursues. Usually, the Federal Reserve acts independently of the government.      With such stark declarations, it's no wonder crypto traders are banging the drums.      Rich Rosenblum, a former Goldman Sachs managing director who now leads the markets group at the digital-asset trading firm GSR, said in an email bitcoin's swift sell-off in early March was driven by ""non-crypto-dedicated professionals moving risk off the table, starting with liquid assets and regardless of conviction level.""      The group was ""largely made up of traditional institutions"" that needed to raise cash fast to meet margin calls and quarterly redemptions, he wrote.      In other words, they weren't even bitcoiners. For those still in the game, or getting in now, the investment case has strengthened.      ""The record stimulus being deployed by central banks is a reminder of why bitcoin was created in the fallout of the last global market crisis,"" Rosenblum wrote. ""People are increasingly skeptical of conventional monetary systems. Bitcoin with its predictable inflationary scheme and 100% uptime offers some certainty in an environment that is otherwise very unpredictable.""      Here's another approach: Just say bitcoin's returns are positive for the year and the cryptocurrency is beating the S&P 500 handily for the second straight year. If the inflation narrative doesn't work, this just might.      – Bradley Keoun, Senior Markets Reporter    Tweet of the day        Bitcoin Watch    BTC: Price: $7,380 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $7,459 | 24-Hr Low: $7,062      Trend: Bitcoin printed a 3.5-week high of $7,459 early Tuesday, taking the cumulative month-to-date gains to 15 percent. At press time, the cryptocurrency is trading near $7,380, representing a 3 percent year-to-date increase. While bitcoin is again reporting gains for 2020, the S&P 500 index is still down over 17 percent.      The cryptocurrency's recent rally looks to be confirming that the rapid drop from $8,000 to $4,000 seen on March 12 and 13 was mainly fueled by non-crypto dedicated professionals moving risk off the table amid the coronavirus-led crisis in the financial markets, according to Richard Rosenblum, co-head of trading at GSR.      The long-term case looks bullish, courtesy of the unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus launched by central banks and governments across the globe. However, a pullback may be seen in the short run, with signs of buyer fatigue emerging on the technical charts.      To start with, bitcoin's upward momentum ran out of steam near the descending 50-day average at $7,370 during the Asian trading hours. Further, key indicators on the hourly and 4-hour charts are reporting overbought conditions.      So bitcoin may fall back to the $7,100-$7,000 price range before convincingly rising above the 50-day average hurdle.      – Omkar Godbole",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/07/first-mover-bitcoins-back-in-the-black-for-2020,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cc181dce8f2a393f6f6382e164039bc3ab6fe534-1500x1016.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In an announcement Tuesday, blockchain-based logistics provider CargoSmart revealed Tesla, the Shanghai International Port Group (SIPG) – the sole operator of the port – and Chinese cargo ship operator COSCO trialed a blockchain app that shortened the cargo release time and makes it easier for Tesla's logistics teams to take ownership of goods once they are offloaded.      The pilot, which was conducted in December, used blockchain to share relevant shipping data and documentation among concerned parties, including Tesla. Access to shared data source streamlined the entire process and enabled the California-based car maker to ""accelerate its cargo pick up procedures on a trusted and secure platform,"" according to CargoSmart.      Wu Yu, head of COSCO's logistics division, said the pilot ""showcased significant efficiency gains not only in the cargo release process but also for downstream supply chain planning by presenting a single source of truth for documentation for all involved parties.""

To avoid confusion and theft, clients need an original bill of lading or waybill – similar to a receipt – that operators use to verify identities and release cargo.      Usually fairly seamless, the cargo release process can grind to halt if an OB/L or waybill is lost or corrupted. Without them, operators can't hand over goods. This creates delays across the supply chain and can lead to heavy fines from port authorities to any ships found overstaying their time in dock.      Following the successful pilot, CargoSmart said it would work to trial the blockchain app in other Asian ports including in Qingdao, China, and in Laem Chabang, Thailand. The company further aims to create a consortium, owned by shipping operators, who will run and administer the distributed ledger system.      The announcement doesn't say much about the type of blockchain used in the pilot, nor the sort of goods Tesla imported into China. Tesla has factories in the country – including one in Shanghai – it uses to build batteries and assemble its cars.      According to the Los Angeles Times, Chinese officials have been quick to provide supplies the company needed to recover quickly from the coronavirus outbreak earlier this year. As Bloomberg reported, Tesla has quietly focused its energies in China and could be about to release a new long-range auto specifically for the Chinese market as early as this week.

42404396,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdi1bU,1586266263,Peer-to-Peer Crypto Exchange Paxful Now Lets You Trade Bitcoin for Gold,"Paxful, a peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange, now allows users to transact in gold.      CEO Ray Youssef said the new service comes in direct response to user requests, offering a swap option and a transfer procedure.      Parties first negotiate terms, including if the gold transfer will happen in person and where. The bitcoin (BTC) holder then sends the agreed-upon funds into a Paxful escrow, where it sits until the gold holder confirms bullion transfer and the counterparty confirms receipt. At that point Paxful releases the bitcoin. All this must happen within 21 days of payment initiation or the parties enter dispute arbitration.      Gold trades must submit to Paxful’s know-your-customer protocols for transfers valued over $50, with “enhanced due diligence” possible for prospective gold sellers, according to a press release. Paxful recently onboarded Chainalysis’ intelligence tools for crypto.      Youssef said the procedure formalizes a process some Paxful users were discreetly executing by listing one payment method, like bank transfers, and then negotiating gold or silver payments outside of the platform.      See also: Crypto Long & Short: Is Bitcoin More Like Gold or Equities?      “Our users were already starting to do this on quite a large scale. We weren't aware of it because it was difficult to track. We actually had to go in and talk to people,” Youssef, who said he still logs hours working Paxful’s support lines, told CoinDesk.      “I’m always interacting with the customers because I want my ears glued to the street,” he said. These customers told him – repeatedly – they wanted to trade gold.      The feature, unique among formally organized exchanges, continues Paxful's strategic positioning as a go-to resource for people and places that other crypto firms often ignore. That means Nigeria, Malaysia, Ghana and Venezuela, for example. Youssef said these are the kinds of countries many companies neglect in their focus on Europe and the U.S.      “The west is not the entirety of the world,” Youssef said. “The vast majority of humans are outside of the west in emerging markets and they are hungry, they’re not going to let anything stop them – COVID-19, Ebola, they don't give a damn, they're going to continue to do business.”      He predicted any pandemic-triggered hesitance to trade goods person to person will be irrelevant in the long term, especially in Africa.

42404392,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdi1YX,1586262366,Blockchain Association Says Court 'Erred' With Decision to Block Telegram's Token Issuance,"The Blockchain Association (BA) has supported Telegram's appeal over a U.S. district court's decision to block the firm's token issuance – even outside the country.      On April 3, in an amicus brief filed with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, the BA argued a recent U.S. district court order denying Telegram's request to issue its forthcoming ""gram"" tokens to investors had ""erred by conflating Telegram’s private placement and the future sales of blockchain tokens.""      The court's earlier preliminary injunction had complied with a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) request to halt the launch of the messaging app firm’s blockchain project TON and prevent the tokens being issued to investors.      Telegram held its sale of future grams in two phases in 2018, raising around $1.7 billion, with the tokens being planned for distribution by the latest deadline of April 30.      ""The two steps are legally and temporally distinct. Indeed, the tokens did not even exist at the time of the private placement,"" the association said. ""Treating the two steps as one defeats the purpose of the [SEC's] private-placement rules. Telegram gathered investments in a private placement with a proper Regulation D filing yet the district court has barred Telegram from delivering the fruits of that investment and, even from finishing the harvest.""      The BA also noted that because gram tokens were used as an investment of money in a cryptocurrency, used by members of a decentralized community connected via blockchain technology, then the tokens were not likely to be deemed a security under the familiar Howey test.    Wider ramifications    U.S. District Judge P. Kevin Castel in the Southern District of New York rejected a request by the messaging platform on March 30 asking if grams could still be issued to non U.S. investors, prompting the subsequent brief filed by the BA.      Judge Castel said on April 1 that Telegram's claim it could issue the tokens to investors and still ensure they did not end up in the hands of U.S. investor was unconvincing.      The Blockchain Association – which advocates for blockchain and cryptocurrencies in the U.S. – further suggested that the ruling is a blow for the entire blockchain industry.      ""Because of the district court’s error, the entire blockchain industry may no longer rely on long-standing exemptions that remain available to all other market participants,"" the BA brief states. ""And the decision below left the industry without any clear indication about when complying with existing law amounts to an unlawful 'scheme' under Howey.""      On March 24, the district court ruled the SEC had “shown a substantial likelihood of success"" in proving the contracts were part of a larger scheme to distribute grams into a secondary public market.      This most recent brief is the second time the BA has filed such a document. It joins the Digital Chamber of Commerce, a blockchain advocacy group, pushing for greater clarity to distinguish between an investment contract and the underlying asset used by Telegram.

42404406,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdi1lK,1586258183,Up 3%: Bitcoin Leaves S&P 500 Behind in Year-to-Date Recovery,"Both bitcoin and the U.S. stock markets have witnessed a notable recovery rally over the past couple of weeks, but it's the cryptocurrency that's taken the lead.      Bitcoin (BTC) clocked a 3.5-week high of $7,459 early on Tuesday, meaning the cryptocurrency was up 4.2 percent from the yearly opening price of $7,160. Since then prices have fallen back slightly, putting the year-to-date gain at around 3.2 percent.      Meanwhile, the U.S. stock markets are still trading in the red on a YTD basis. The S&P 500, Wall Street’s equity index, has pulled off a strong 21.5 percent rally from lows near $2,190 reached on March 23, but even so it's still down 17.5 percent for the year.      Gold, a classic haven asset, has gained around 2 percent so far since Jan. 1.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $7,445 – up around 90 percent from the low of $3,867 observed on March 13, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      As bitcoin looks to be moving in tandem with the equity markets, what's behind bitcoin’s outperformance of the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis?    Rally fueled by crypto investors    Bitcoin may be gaining altitude because the market is now dominated by long-term investors who believe in the narrative that the cryptocurrency is a hedge against global economic duress brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.      Bitcoin’s rapid drop from $8,000 to $3,867 seen on March 12 and March 13 was mainly fueled by long liquidations by institutions and macro traders. “These non-crypto dedicated participants squared off their long positions to raise the cash needed to fund margin calls,” said Richard Rosenblum, co-head of trading at GSR.      “Following the liquidations, the market is primarily made up of crypto-native firms and long investors. Not surprisingly, bitcoin is acting more bullish,” Rosenblum said.      The coronavirus-led sell-off in the equity markets, triggered a global dash for cash, which saw macro traders sell everything from gold to bitcoin.      Derivatives market data does suggest institutions took a break from the crypto markets in March. Open interest, or open contracts, in futures listed on global exchanges fell from $4 billion on March 11 to $2 billion on March 14, according to data from research firm Skew.      See also: Bitcoin’s Crash Triggers Over $700M in Liquidations on BitMEX      The cryptocurrency is expected to maintain its upward trajectory and challenge the high of $8,000 seen just before the March 12 sell-off.      “Bitcoin is within shouting distance of its March meltdown level, and could make par by the weekend,” Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Hong Kong-based blockchain investment and trading firm Kenetic told CoinDesk.      Chu, however, warned the cryptocurrency is still on uncertain ground and could slip back below $7,000. A pullback may be seen if key resistance near $7,480 proves a tough nut to crack.    Daily and 4-hour charts    Bitcoin charted a green marubozu candle on Monday (above left), which comprises a big body and small or no wicks. The candle indicates buyers were in control from the open to the close, reflecting strong bullish sentiment.      The pattern strengthened the case for a rally to $8,000 put forward by a pennant breakout confirmed last week.      So far, however, the buyers have failed to challenge the 50-day average hurdle at $7,482. Bitcoin narrowly missed passing the average resistance early on Tuesday, with prices dropping back from $7,459.      If the hurdle continues to cap upside during the U.S. trading hours, an overbought reading on the 4-hour chart relative strength index would gain credence, possibly yielding a drop to the daily chart rising channel support, currently at $6,810.

42404394,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdi1aV,1586253600,'Ship-to-Ship' Trade and Other Secrets of North Korea's Illicit $1.5B Crypto Stash,"Experts looking at how North Korea continues to import and export goods despite numerous sanctions agree the country’s $1.5 billion cryptocurrency war chest is used to fund an illicit web of trade networks and supply chains.      Blockchain analytics company Chainalysis said it is “comfortable” with the $1.5 billion figure stated in a recent webinar (a significant increase on various estimates made last year, ranging from about $200 million to $500 million for the amount of crypto amassed by the Hermit Kingdom).      Jesse Spiro, global head of policy and regulatory affairs for Chainalysis, told CoinDesk it’s logical to assume North Korea’s ill-gotten crypto is being moved in trade-based money-laundering networks.      “When it comes to trade-based money laundering, the issue, especially for sanctioned actors, is cross-border money movements,” said Spiro. “When you talk about how North Korea could actually execute this in relation to finances, I believe crypto is used to facilitate it.”      Priscilla Moriuchi, head of nation-state research at Recorded Future and a non-resident fellow at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, pointed to recent examples of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) moving crypto across borders in the latest U.S. Department of Justice indictment of two Chinese nationals involved in laundering over $100 million of crypto.      The “logical conclusion” is North Korean is using cryptocurrencies to fund trade networks, said Moriuchi. Evidence documenting this cross-border movement is still in the early stages of being published, she said.      “I believe it is happening but that we have not been able to document the end-to-end lifecycle yet. We have many pieces of the puzzle we just do not have the complete picture,” Moriuchi said.      Sleuthing by Chainalysis has mapped flows of crypto stolen by North Korean hackers moving to exchanges. As with Moriuchi, the analytics firm has yet to detect concrete links to global trade networks.      “There may be active law enforcement or government investigations into this,” said Spiro. “But even if we were privy to anything like that, it's not something we would be able to discuss.”      Neither the U.S. Treasury Department nor the Justice Department replied to requests for comment by press time.    Two if by sea    A reliable way for DPRK to circumvent sanctions involves ship-to-ship transfers, the process of moving cargo from one ship to another in the open sea rather than at a port. This can sometimes involve switching off a vessel’s automatic identification system (AIS) or using flags of convenience, where a ship is registered in a country other than that of its owners.      In March 2019, a report by a United Nations Security Council panel of experts highlighted a massive increase in illegal ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum products and coal, in defiance of U.N. resolutions relating to North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.      Another key area is cyber activity, including a firm focus on cryptocurrency. The U.N. report points to at least five successful hacks of crypto exchanges in 2017-18. In addition to targeting exchanges, North Korean hacking groups collect cryptocurrency from ransomware attacks and some mining of coins also takes place.      “Given the increased anonymity of cryptocurrencies, newly mined cryptocurrency can be used to facilitate sanctions-evasion activity,” the report from the U.N. panel of experts states.      According to the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a U.K.-based security think tank, North Korea uses crypto to pay directly for goods and resources that are explicitly prohibited by international sanctions. Other crypto uses include fundraising with the aim of converting to fiat, or simply stockpiling coins in the hope that prices increase.    As well as directly purchasing sanctioned luxury goods, North Korean actors could use cryptocurrencies to pay for trading services, the RUSI report continueshttps://www.rusi.org/sites/default/files/20190412_closing_the_crypto_gap_web.pdf, such as making payments to shipping companies, brokers or other intermediaries who might be willing to accept payment in crypto coins.    “There are all these middlemen that North Korea absolutely needs in order to be able to export goods like seafood or to be able to place workers overseas,” said Kayla Izenman, research analyst at RUSI. “You have to pay these people somehow and a logical way would be to use crypto.”      Using peer-to-peer crypto transactions to lubricate DPRK’s trade network also means less reliance on sifting funds through certain Chinese banks, which are seeing a clampdown from U.S. regulators.      It also reduces the need to carry undeclared bulk cash, which on occasion gets detected. In October of 2018, for example, the captain of a DPRK vessel was detained at customs in Vladivostok, Russia, carrying $180,000 in black plastic bags.    ‘Well-run apparatus’    Since 2016 there has been an attempt to clamp down on North Korea’s coal exports, which used to earn the regime about $1 billion a year. But less attention has been paid to other sanctioned sectors including exports of textiles (earning $760 million per year), seafood ($300 million), iron and lead ore ($360 million), according to RUSI.      This network of supply chains can be combined with North Korea’s technical advancements in areas like crypto, which far outweighs attempts made by other sanctioned countries like Iran or Venezuela, said RUSI’s Izenman.      “North Korea has been doing this for so long and has such a well-run apparatus both within hacking and sanctions evasion, it makes sense they would link those up,” she said.      This “well-run apparatus” comprises technical universities that essentially teach people how to become hackers for the North Korean government.      “That’s all they do, and there are hundreds of them,” said Izenman. “All these subgroups and different bureaus and they all do slightly different things. It's very clear how much better they are at this than any other nation-state.”      DPRK even organized the Pyongyang Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference, an event which led last year to the controversial arrest and indictment of Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith for sanctions violations. The event was scheduled to take place again in late February but may have been postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak.    Curious case    Further insight as to how North Korea is thinking about combining blockchain with illicit trade can be found in the curious case of an Ethereum-based blockchain project called Marine Chain, which also gets a mention in last year’s U.N. Security Council report.      Back in October 2018, the U.N. panel was informed that Hong Kong-registered Marine Chain, which would tokenize ownership of vessels, was backed by at least one DPRK individual.      It’s unclear whether Marine Chain was expected to go into production, or if it was simply a means to raise funds via an initial coin offering (ICO). In any case, the project’s shady owners vanished soon after being contacted by security officials.      “The platform could be used to generate money for the regime and as a potential means of evading sanctions on shipping by creating a new method of obscuring the ownership of a vessel,” the U.N. report stated.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/04/07/ship-to-ship-trade-and-other-secrets-of-north-koreas-illicit-15b-crypto-stash,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7229d49ba5957254515884401a2b6b2bf3b817ca-1500x965.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404400,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdi1cT,1586244748,Ether Rises to 28-Day High Amid Positive Sentiment for Coming 'Eth 2.0' Upgrade,"Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, has recorded its single biggest daily gain in over 20 days amid growing confidence in the platform, experts say.      Ether (ETH) has been performing exceptionally well, thanks in large part to an April 6 close that saw the price finish up by 20 percent – its highest single day gain since March 13. ETH is currently up 17.25 percent over a 24-hour period, having lost some ground in the early Asian hours of trading.      Industry experts told CoinDesk the rise can likely be attributed to growing confidence in a planned system-wide upgrade known as Eth 2.0 slated for July 2020.      The 2.0 upgrade, often called Serenity, promises higher transaction throughput and a new security model under proof-of-stake (PoS). Eth 2.0 has been in development since 2015 but had failed to gain traction due to the highly technical expertise required to pursue it, until now.      ""From a developer standpoint, Ethereum is the most popular blockchain where most of the smart contract and dapp activity occurs,"" says Demian Brener, founder and CEO of OpenZeppelin, a leading security audit firm for Ethereum.      ""People are realizing that Ethereum's network effects especially around community and composability (ETH smart contracts interacting with each other) are stronger than they thought, which might lead to increased trust in the platform and thus higher prices,"" Brener added.      See also: Vitalik Buterin Explains the New Tech Behind Eth 2.0 (video)      Given the five-year development cycle for the Ethereum network, not a single challenger cryptocurrency has made a dent in ether's leading position, according to Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Hong Kong-based blockchain investment and trading firm Kenetic, who echoed Brener's sentiments.      ""Ethereum continues to be the veteran number two coin in crypto, and its recent price surge demonstrates traders' long-term belief in its market position,"" Chu said.      ""Price aside, the real story is how Ethereum continues to march towards Eth 2.0 and resolving legitimate criticisms around network speed and scalability.

In a co-written blog post by WEF Head of Digital Trade Ziyang Fan and Rebecca Liao, executive vice president of blockchain enterprise firm Skuchain, the authors said this pandemic has forced many companies to grapple with their supply chains’ unexpected fragility, and prompted experts to reiterate “the need to obtain more visibility across the chain.”      That’s because many end-chain companies only knew their sourced parts’ immediate history, the authors wrote. “They usually have little to no knowledge of suppliers further up the chain,” and therefore little to no way of knowing if those unknowns are vulnerable to disruption.      See also: Why the World Economic Forum Is Creating a Blockchain ‘Bill of Rights’      Fan and Liao wrote blockchain would add such transparency without sacrificing corporate privacy. A properly built blockchain system would give broader access to relevant parties and also allow them to purchase supply chain data from their up-stream suppliers.      “Blockchain is the ideal technology to ensure that data on performance and risk, which underpin all supply chain finance transactions, can be shared in an authenticated manner with financiers and other parties to a transaction, even when there is no direct relationship between them,” the authors wrote.      See also: 8 US States Follow DHS in Naming ‘Blockchain Managers’ as Essential Employees in Coronavirus Crisis      Record digitization is Fan's and Liao’s other partial solution to this crisis. For one, digitized supply chain records are far more accessible than paper copies, which, in this age of shuttered offices and stay-at-home orders may well be out of reach.

42404391,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdi1XY,1586232000,Germany's Crypto Custody Law Hits a Snag: Startups Can't Get Bank Accounts,"While more than 40 banks have reportedly expressed interest in Germany’s new crypto custody license, those firms may still have to put up with an anti-crypto sentiment among German banks.      “If you try to open a bank account for a company that is in the space, you are working with the institutional banking arm of that bank,” said Stijn Vander Straeten, CEO of Crypto Storage AG.      German bankers are risk averse, and crypto companies aren’t making them money by asking for checking accounts.      In November, Switzerland-based Crypto Storage AG, a subsidiary of Crypto Finance AG, opened a German branch in downtown Frankfurt called Crypto Storage Deutschland GMBH so it could be eligible to apply for the license. Around 15 banks turned down Crypto Storage Deutschland before it found its current bank, Straeten said. The bank that eventually accepted Crypto Storage as a customer had to first be convinced to take on the account by Sven Hildebrandt, head of the consulting firm DLC.      “We get calls from different [crypto] companies that want to go to the German market and get regulated. Many of them have this problem,” said Matthias Winter, fintech lead at Eversheds Sutherland Germany, a firm working directly with German regulators on how the law should be enforced. “There is no legal reason why banks wouldn’t offer bank accounts but they are hesitant because they don’t understand the business.”      While many banks with custody services in Germany have talked about the law in the German press, the only banks that have announced an intention to apply for the law have been tech-focused service providers like solarisBank, which opened a digital assets unit in December 2019 in anticipation of the law passing.      In a report that came out at the beginning of the year, BNP Paribas Securities Services Head of Germany and Austria Thorsten Gommel said he wanted the bank to continue to lead on custody, including custody of digital assets.      When CoinDesk reached out to BNP Paribas, the bank changed its tune.      “As a leading global custodian, the custody and safekeeping of digital assets is a topic we are following closely,” said BNP Paribas spokesperson Caroline Lumley. “We are currently exploring what services can be developed for digital assets linked to the tokenized economy, focusing solely on regulated assets.”      At the beginning of March, Crypto Storage Deutschland notified Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) it planned to apply for the crypto custody license. It’s also currently hiring four to six full-time employees for the branch, including a compliance specialist from the banking industry and a CEO who is “fit and proper” in BaFin’s eyes.      Crypto Storage AG is also working on a white-labeled custody solution where the company could custody for banks and other startups that want to custody crypto in Germany but either don’t want to set up a branch in Germany (in the case of startups) or take away resources from traditional lines of business (in the case of banks). The application will cost upwards of 2 million euros.    Crypto banking isn’t worth it yet    Meanwhile, crypto firms and institutions still have many uncertainties related to applying for the crypto custody license that BaFin will clarify over time.      The industry doesn’t know exactly what type of activities would qualify as crypto custody, said Daniel Resas, associated partner with Schnittker Möllmann Partners in Hamburg, a firm that advises banks on blockchain projects.      Crypto exchanges could easily count as crypto custodians, but if a company’s business model includes staking or putting a digital asset into a smart contract for a limited period of time, it’s not clear whether that would be considered crypto custody under the current German law, Resas said.      Crypto did get some clarification at the beginning of March, with BaFin guidance saying crypto firms will be considered custodians if they have access to customer’s private keys. This might rule out tech providers who only see encrypted versions of private keys, but how it affects multi-party computation companies is less certain, Winter said.      At the beginning of April, BaFin also released additional details around what IT and security should look like for firms interested in applying and the level of expertise managing directors should have.      “It’s not typical that BaFin would put out guidance like this,” Winter said. “Since they’re talking to tech companies, they’re changing the way they are communicating. If there were changes to laws for classic banking, they wouldn’t put out guidance because banks have large legal departments.”      While BaFin has published a nonbinding application for companies to follow when applying for a crypto custody license in the country, the application doesn’t include the amount of detail BaFin will likely require, Resas added. While the regulator is focused on know-your-customer and anti-money laundering currently, BaFin will likely create more rules around operational risk down the road.      Despite the unknowns, having crypto firms enter a regulated German market is an advancement for the crypto industry at large, said Florian Reul, managing associate for law firm Linklaters.      “You cannot shine a brighter light on that area than with a BaFin license,” Reul said.    Crypto firms vs. depository banks?    In BaFin’s March guidance, the regulator said security tokens coming from security token offerings (STOs) can be custodied by a crypto custodian, without the help of a depository bank.      Two of Germany’s finance ministries are working on a draft law that addresses the issuance of digital securities. The release date will be decided after the Ministry of Justice has consulted with the federal government.      While it’s not known yet whether these digital securities can be custodied by a crypto custodian, the technology to custody security tokens will be in demand if the law is passed, Winter said.      “Banks would have to acquire the tech by buying crypto custodians,” Winter said. “If [digital security custody] is allowed for crypto custodians, they would be in a much bigger market.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/04/07/germanys-crypto-custody-law-hits-a-snag-startups-cant-get-bank-accounts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3a2fbfedcab2e5bb1856130c99e58b425bc34bf9-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
