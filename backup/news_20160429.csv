42378695,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lM1n,1461967675,10 Must-See Moments at Consensus 2016,"CoinDesk’s Consensus 2016 conference kicks off Monday for three days of blockchain technology discussion, promising a wide array of engaging panelists, industry power-brokers and groundbreaking announcements, presentations and more.  While three days of conference can be a lot to take in, there are some moments set to take place next week that attendees simply must not miss.  CoinDesk takes a look at some of these must-see moments to come:  10. 21 Inc Meets R3  Can you say polar opposites?  One is the CEO of a $121m Silicon Valley bitcoin company, the other is the head of the blockchain consortium representing more than 40 of the world’s largest banks.  The last panel on the week’s agenda will feature a powerhouse discussion with 21 Inc CEO Balaji Srinivasan and R3CEV founder and CEO David Rutter. Up for debate will be the future of the technology itself, with each CEO presenting their vision for the path ahead.  Expect the discourse to heat up given the disparate takes each firm has on the ecosystem. Will they reach consensus? We’ll have to wait and see.  9. Proof of Work competition  What tech conference wouldn’t be complete without its own ‘Shark Tank’?  Five blockchain startups – The Sun Exchange, CoinPrism, Lawnmower, Uniquid and Colony – are to compete for $10,000 on day two of the event. But, who are the sharks?  Judges include Santander InnoVentures’ Pascal Bouvier; CME Ventures’ Rumi Morales; Pantera Capital’s Dan Morehead; RRE’s James Robinson and Tally Capital’s Matt Roszak.  Which one will survive? Only time will tell.  8. Real blockchain demos  Don’t quite get bitcoin and blockchain yet? Well, seeing is believing.  Day one will see two industry startups – Abra and BitPay – demo blockchain remittances apps alongside Visa Europe Collab, Visa Europe’s international innovation hub.  What’s to see? Two of the industry’s best-funded startups – representing $46.5m in investor confidence – will demo new technology, a must see given that Abra and BitPay are also among the quieter startups in industry.  7. A director from AT&T and Nasdaq  AT&T, Brookings Institute, the Council on Foreign Relations, Nasdaq, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Silver Lake Partners.  With this expansive resume, Glenn Hutchins aims to take the stage at Consensus 2016 for a talk that discusses the state of innovation in the industry.  Entitled ‘Why Bitcoin Still Matters’, it’s safe to say Hutchins’ talk might not be what you’d typically hear from a financial industry leader. But, what will he say about blockchain?  6. State of Blockchain preview  CoinDesk’s quarterly State of Blockchain report is a must-have for industry executives, but those attending Consensus 2016 will get an exclusive first look.  Our head of research Garrick Hileman will act as the emcee, providing a 20-minute opening overview that covers trends in VC funding and the ongoing shift from bitcoin to blockchain services, among other data-driven topics.  5. Gavin Andresen meets Bitcoin Core  Leading technologists will take to the stage on day one as part of a panel session entitled “Reaching Consensus on Open Blockchains”.  VeriFi chairman Pindar Wong will moderate a panel including Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and Neha Narula of the MIT Digital Currency Initiative.  The must-see moment? Former Bitcoin Core maintainer Gavin Andressen and current Bitcoin Core spokesperson Eric Lombrozo will also be onstage weighing in on the topic.  Given the longstanding disagreements between bitcoin’s developer teams, this session could prove to be one to watch.  4. Larry Summers talks blockchain  A former advisor to US Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, Larry Summers has since emerged as a quiet but notable voice in the bitcoin and blockchain space.  Next Tuesday, Summers will sit down for a one-on-one chat about the technology in the context of global affairs.  Coming after a day of engaging panel discussions on business and policy issues, Summers’ talk offers a unique perspective on blockchain’s potential in the world today.  3. Chain and Visa's presentation  Last September, payments network giant Visa was one of several major companies to invest in blockchain startup Chain.  Now, some of the fruits of that partnership will be on full display at Consensus 2016. Visa Venture Program lead Peter Berg and Chain CEO Adam Ludwin will be on hand to walk through what the two companies have been working on in the research lab.  2. 21 Inc's mystery announcement  One of the big mysteries surrounding next week’s event has to do with 21 Inc, the Silicon Valley-based startup behind the 21 Bitcoin Computer.  CEO Balaji Srinivasan will be giving a special presentation on “How to Get Bitcoin (Without Mining or Buying Bitcoin)”.  What will he unveil? Given Srinivasan’s unique take on the technology and history of unpredictable announcements, the full reveal will be sure toto leave attendees talking.  1. Delaware's 'Blockchain Initiative' unveiled  Arguably one of the most exciting sessions planned for Consensus, the Delaware government’s work with blockchain represents one of the first major public sector projects involving the technology.  Featuring a special appearance by Governor Jack Markell of Delaware, the presentation – which starts at 8:20am on Monday – offers an in-depth look at how the state government is looking to leverage the technology for public services.  How is the state leveraging blockchain and does it involve bitcoin? We'll keep you posted with live reports!

42378681,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lLmh,1461960947,Bitcoin Price Ends Turbulent Week as Bull Run Fades,"Markets Weekly is a column analyzing price movements in the global digital currency markets, and the technology's use case as an asset class.    Bitcoin prices fluctuated significantly during the week ending 29th April, reaching a yearly high of $470 before falling below $440.  Global bitcoin prices enjoyed a strong rally at the beginning of the week, rising 4.2% from $451.10 at 12:00 UTC on 22nd April to a high of $470.16 at 18:00 UTC on 26th April. This price represented the digital currency’s strongest value since 7th December, 2015, when it reached an inter-day high of $470.88, CoinDesk BPI data shows.  Both a short squeeze and retail investors helped fuel this rally, Petar Zivkovski, director of operations at bitcoin trading forum Whale Club, told CoinDesk.  Zivkovski offered Whaleclub internal data backing up his assertion, stating that prior to the decline in price, his users reported a long-to-short ratio of 5.5 to 1.  Bull run ends  While bitcoin’s rally produced some quick gains, it lasted only a short while before the digital currency changed direction and started declining.  One factor was that trading volume during the run-up was ""lackluster"", Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of BitMEX, told CoinDesk. Hayes added that ""volumes should have grown more as we kept rising, and they didn't.""  ""Without more pressure to sustain the rally, it corrected,"" he said.  Bitcoinity data helps support his claim, as market participants traded 19.6m BTC during the seven prior days. This figure fell short of the roughly 30m BTC in weekly volume bitcoin repeatedly experienced when it traded within a range between $410 and $440.  By early trading on 27th April (between 12:00 and 14:59 UTC), the digital currency had fallen to a low of $450.87. Bitcoin then proceeded to break through the key psychological levels of both $450 and $440, dropping to a weekly low of $435.28 between 00:00-02:59 UTC on 28th April.  The sharp decline in bitcoin prices represented a long squeeze, which came easily since the long-to-short ratio was so high at the end of the rally, Zivkovski told CoinDesk.  ""As large and smart players started exiting at the top after the price failed to make new highs, the rookie players who bought the top started to close their long positions aggressively to cut their losses,” he said, adding:  ""This aggressive selling then continued to push price down, which continued to trigger stop losses for long positions (both automatic and manual) across exchanges.""  However, the week didn't end on a sour note.  During the last few days of the week, bitcoin managed to recover some of its losses, surpassing $450 between 21:00-23:59 UTC on 28th April and then finishing the week at $449.86.  Ether's slide continues  While bitcoin pushed higher, prices for ether, the native token on the Ethereum blockchain, declined, falling to 0.019 BTC (roughly $8) by the time bitcoin hit $470.16.  This figure was 13.6% lower than ether’s value of 0.022 BTC (about $10) at the start of the week, representing a decline more than three times the change experienced by bitcoin.  One market expert, Chris Burniske, told CoinDesk the negative correlation existed partially ""due to the fact that ether is valued in terms of bitcoin"".  Burniske, analyst and blockchain products lead at investment management firm ARK Invest, stated that another major driver of this negative correlation was market participants moving capital from the former market to the latter, a trend he argued adversely affected ether.  At press time, ether managed to recover somewhat, ending the week with a closing price of 0.020 BTC (or about $9).  Charles L.

42378678,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lLhf,1461955808,Deloitte Uses Facebook to Build Warranties on Bitcoin Blockchain,"Deloitte has used Facebook's recently released Messenger API to build an early version of a product capable of storing warranties on a blockchain and allowing users to buy insurance for items even after they've been purchased.  The minimum viable product (MVP), announced todayhttps://www2.deloitte.com/nl/nl/pages/deloitte-digital/artikelen/warranty-solution-based-on-blockchain.html, could serve as a bridge between distributed ledgers and the Internet of Things, but importantly, do so without users having to download any new applications.  Deloitte service designer, Frank van de Ven, wrote of the MVP on the company’s site:  ""It allows users to add information regarding their purchases and associated warranty information on the blockchain, by using a Facebook Messenger bot.""  As of June 2015 there were 1 billion Facebook Messenger users. To let innovators build products for those users, Facebook expanded its Messenger support at its annual F8 conference in April by offering a new send and receive API that allows for the construction of custom Messenger bots.  Van de Ven explained the importance of that access by indicating that app fatigue is now high among consumers, who he says now use only around five apps on average.  ""By offering our service through an existing channel we are taking away a huge hurdle in engaging new users,"" van de Ven said.  How the MVP works  The result of a three-day internal hackathon, the ""warranty bot"" lets users send an image of a specially designed receipt via Facebook Messenger. Built on the bitcoin blockchain using the Colu blockchain toolbox, Deloitte's product ""unwraps"" a QR code on the receipt and stores the product information on a blockchain.  Multiple warranties can then be stored in a profile accessible via a link also transmitted via Facebook Messenger. The MVP provides users the opportunity to buy insurance for the product even after he or she has left the point of sale.  By uploading the warranty to a blockchain, van de Ven says the warrant bot will let product owners transfer the warranty if the item is resold. The new owners can in-turn track the entire history of the blockchain-logged warranty.  ""The ability to store assets in a safe and secure, tamper-proof way, opens up a whole new world for financial institutes, retailers, governments and other industries,"" wrote van de Ven, adding:  ""What we’ve learned from our hackathon only underlines this belief.""  Business applications  The MVP is currently a white-labelled offering which means it doesn’t include Deloitte’s branding and could theoretically be employed by third-party companies once it's ready for use.  As for the Facebook Messenger interface, that feature is interchangeable, enabling use with WhatsApp or banking and insurance applications in the future should the company continue to iterate the idea.  While the MVP announced today is still in its early phases, other possible uses include making it easier for insurers to calculate the estimated total value of goods; letting insurers and banks offer the option via a widget; and letting retailers offer automated services such as product updates without a dedicated app.  Image credit: Jakraphong Photography / Shutterstock.com  Blockchain Concept animation  from Deloitte Digital NL on Vimeo.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC,Michael del Castillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/04/29/deloitte-uses-facebook-to-build-warranties-on-bitcoin-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1038ca0f9562cddc1f19b5024dc2fe8e6bdef13d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42378682,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lLnx,1461948695,Europe's Regulatory Blockchain Shift on Display at Private Parliament Event,"Gabrielle Patrick is a UK & US lawyer specializing in cryptofinance and distributed ledger (DL) technology. She is the co-founder and general counsel of Epiphyte, which enables instant settlement of trades and transactions using DLs.  In this feature, Patrick provides an on-the-ground look at a recent EU Parliament event that focused on digital currencies and blockchain tech.  In an unprecedented move, the EU Parliament hosted a non-commercial roundtable on cryptocurrencies and blockchain last week. The purpose was to educate members (MEPs) on the world of blockchain technology and set the stage for future regulatory agendas.  Taking part were representatives from the EU Commission, the Bank for International Settlements, the World Bank, the United Nations, Europol, ESMA, the UK Treasury, the Bank of England, Nasdaq, as well as startups Blockchain and Epiphyte. The event was facilitated by the European Digital Currency & Blockchain Technology Forum, a public policy platform for virtual currencies and distributed ledger technology.  The tenor of the discussion was one of overwhelming support for the blockchain sector, with the expressed intent to not prematurely regulate or over regulate.  Conducted under Chatham House rules, an emphasis was placed on today being the best opportunity for descriptive – and not prescriptive – regulation, when we are moving from an analog world to a digital world and from siloed banking to networked banking.  The true discussion now is not really about the bitcoin blockchain or distributed ledger technology, but shared ledgers that allow interconnected financial services.  Deep dive  The roundtables explored how cryptocurrencies have sparked an examination of the issuance of money itself and the structural instability of financial systems. Since monopolies rely on a lack of inter-connectivity and diversity of systems, they are structurally unstable – and cryptocurrencies can see the end of a 300-year old bank debt monopoly.  Epiphyte led the discussion on using shared ledgers as an enhanced regulatory reporting and oversight tool. Even though this aspect has been overlooked in the past in the bitcoin/blockchain dialogue, it is one that deserves significant attention.  For the first time, we see a technology that allows for a single, standardized view of data that can be updated in real time across multiple silos of global institutions, and that can be accessed with multiple digital keys creating different permission levels under different schemes tailor-made to regulatory needs.  Legal angle  From a legal point of view, there was discussion on the exact governance of shared ledgers.  What we are seeing now are different types of ledgers which provide a menu of governance options – public law, private law, algorithmic governance or programmable systems/behavior.  This menu of governance has been presented to us in this way for the first time. Laws also need to catch up. For example, there's a need to legally recognize the possession of stocks and bonds using shared ledgers, and the finality or transfer of assets on those ledgers.  As analyzed during the roundtables, regulation needs to support innovation, not be overly burdensome and above all, constitute clear policy goals.  It was observed that shared ledgers and cryptocurrencies were invented long after the regulatory goals which fostered the current regimes were created.  Therefore, what must be kept in mind is whether the current regulatory goals are limiting creative disruption and, if they are, what changes are needed. Also, roundtable participants described shared ledgers and cryptocurrencies as a nascent but disruptive innovation, so that there must be a dedicated effort to identify gaps in current regulations and determine how to fill those gaps without premature or overly burdensome regulation.  While there have been signals to regulate bitcoin exchanges and wallets, it is important to distinguish between custodial and noncustodial wallets and the grey areas of multi-signature custodianship.  On regulation  Regulators commented that with new innovation brings new risks, but that cryptocurrencies and shared ledgers represent a cheap and efficient global payments infrastructure, the use of which should not be over regulated at this time.  The roundtables explored a variety of topics, such as the need for a government-issued cryptocurrency that enables the instant settlement of transactions, the amount of integration work needed now to implement the technology, and the lack of any evidence that cryptocurrencies pose a systemic risk or are a good conduit for money laundering.  Perhaps the most powerful message of the EU Parliament-hosted conference was that we need a permissionless environment in order to truly innovate, and that premature regulation would only stifle the use of cryptocurrencies and shared ledgers.

42378691,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lLy1,1461942347,Blockchain Data Platform Tierion Raises $1 Million,"Blockchain data startup Tierion has raised $1m in seed funding from several of the industry’s leading venture capital firms.  The round was co-led by San Francisco-based Blockchain Capital and China-based Fenbushi Capital, which raised $50m in 2015 with the intent of investing in blockchain-based startups and projects. Digital Currency Group also participated in the round.  The news comes one year after the service launched last September following a winning debut at the Consensus 2015 Makeathon. Tierion allows users to turn data from web and mobile apps into blockchain receipts that are hashed, stored and timestamped on the bitcoin blockchain.  In interview, CEO Wayne Vaughan said that the funding comes at a time when his firm is seeing increased interest from institutional partners seeking to leverage its free API service to ensure data integrity.  Vaughan told CoinDesk:  ""Tierion allows you to have a high volume of records anchored to public blockchains. Instead of putting something on the blockchain, we’re allowing you to anchor your data to the blockchain.""  Vaughan’s service uses the bitcoin blockchain, which he said is the preferred choice for any business that wants to ensure data integrity, positioning it as what could be one of the biggest institutional uses of such versions of the technology. Tierion, he said, is also preparing a version of its technology for the Ethereum blockchain.  Tierion has also hired Koinify veteran Tom Kysar as its second full-time employee, and said that is looking to double its staff in the coming months.  Going to market  Though Vaughan hinted at institutional partners, right now, he said a diversity of startups and online services are already leveraging Tierion.  For example, he cited peer-to-peer leasing marketplace Flip, which is using the service to secure information on qualified lessees.  In statements, Flip founder and CEO Susannah Vila stated that her company is using the service as a way to ensure trust between landlords and subletters.  ""Integrating a report with a blockchain is one member of how we are gripping everybody honest and improving trust and trustworthiness for both landlords and renters,"" Vila said.  Tierion’s public partners also include Philips, the healthcare giant that has been increasingly active in announcing blockchain industry partnerships. The company announced it had conducted the first project with Philips in October.  Vaughan said his firm is also now working with its institutional partners to ensure its technology can provide assurances for data security specific to government or healthcare use cases, which may have more strict rules for such processes.  Case for public chains  While one of the more talked-about use cases for the technology, Vaughn doesn’t see permissioned blockchains as being useful for data integrity use cases.  ""Bitcoin is distributed all over the world, so you get data integrity. There’s a huge incentive for the blockchain to continue. Companies can go out of business, consortiums can get dissolved,"" Vaughan said.  Tierion’s fundraising notably follows an announcement by IBM in which the tech giant has indicated it is working to ensure its cloud environments are able to meet data security benchmarks for use in permissioned blockchain-based networks.  Still, Vaughan’s investors believe that Tierion’s model may offer benefits, lauding the service as an example of how public blockchains can be leveraged by institutions.  “You don’t need to build a blockchain for this. You can use our API to get a receipt for anything that was purchased,"" Vaughan said, adding:  ""It’s better to anchor your data in the blockchain then to build a blockchain.""

42378687,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lLsz,1461940408,Isle of Man Regulator Seeks Rule Change to Ease Bitcoin Gambling,"The government of the Isle of Man is looking to plug a gap in its gambling regulations as they relate to bitcoin and other digital currencies.  Officials are currently weighing regulatory changes that would allow gambling services to accept digital currencies “as if they were cash”.  Specifically, the Isle of Man’s Gambling Supervision Commission (GSC) wants to tweak the definition of “the deposit of money” currently on the books to include “the deposit of something which has a value in money or money’s worth”, which would cover digital currencies.  Mark Rutherford, deputy chief executive of the GSC, told CoinDesk that the move addresses “a small hook in our gambling law” – but one not necessarily being driven by demand from licensees.  According to Rutherford, no one is currently seeking approval to offer gambling denominated in digital currencies. He attributed this, in part, to the “significant challenges for any operator” looking to offer such services.  At the same time, he said, the Isle of Man government doesn’t want to impede any future economic development or technology innovation – hence, the move to plug the regulatory gap.  He explained:  “We’re ironing that out so that if the commercial climate in the future becomes less challenging for block-chain based payment channels, it won’t be our law that prevents their adoption (notwithstanding our Commission will have the final say on whether any given technology can be used.)”  Last May, the quasi-independent Isle of Man made headlines when it announced that it had launched a blockchain trial in partnership with a local startup called Pythia.  The island’s Department of Economic Development has long sought a proactive stance on digital currencies, becoming an early mover in updating its regulations to account for the technology. Just over a year ago, the local government moved to bring domestic digital currency startups under the auspices of its anti-money laundering regulation.

42378686,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lLqT,1461931205,IBM Targets Government and Healthcare Sectors With Blockchain Cloud Upgrade,"IBM has announced a new framework for securing blockchain systems running in its cloud services, a move it believes will help financial firms and businesses satisfy regulatory and security concerns that could inhibit the use of the emerging technology.  At issue, IBM said, is that some cloud environments leave open vulnerabilities that could allow tampering or unauthorized access to permissioned blockchain-based systems, a risk that the company suggested may be limiting or discouraging certain use cases in sectors where data standards are more complex.  In interview, Jerry Cuomo, vice president of blockchain at IBM, said that the new framework is about ""upping the pace"" of blockchain adoption by eliminating such concerns and easing usability for developers.  Cuomo framed existing public blockchains as secure, yet ill-suited for businesses given the existence of strict data protection requirements, stating:  ""Business require data consistency. Public blockchains have clever algorithms … but the blockchain in some of these architectures could drift, you could have two versions of truth. In a business, that level of inconsistency can’t be tolerated.""  IBM said that it believes the new framework will help organizations create ""secure cloud environments"" for permissioned blockchains that exceed security and compliance requirements for industries that could benefit from the technology.  These include governments or healthcare providers that want to leverage blockchain-based systems given that they must adhere to standards such as the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS 140-2) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  Elsewhere, IBM said it made improvements to its cloud service that will now allow networks to be deployed in minutes, with upgrades made to its documentation and dashboards.  IBM has also made the code it donated to the Hyperledger project available on code repository linking service Docker Hub, and released the beta version of its blockchain offerings for its cloud platform Bluemix.  Amid the development push, major financial firms are getting involved. BNY Mellon is working with the company on the design and development of blockchain-based applications as part of its IBM Garage offerings, physical venues in which IBM provides its subject matter expertise.  The role of cloud  The emphasis on cloud comes at a time when many institutions are wondering whether to deploy blockchain-based networks on premise or in a cloud environment.  However, Cuomo argued that the cloud offers benefits given that the use of the cloud in tandem with blockchain leads to an architecture that is similar to how the Web works.  ""Everything on the Web is public but permissioned, and we see blockchain being no different. The thought is there’s a set of rules that govern the network, and that the group that establishes the network, what the rules and the roles are and what the security is,"" he said.  The cloud, he argued, will become important as the nature of blockchain networks becomes more expansive. For example, he noted that a blockchain that manages vehicle ownership may need to provide access to auto manufacturers, dealers, leasing companies and even scrapyards at the end of the car’s lifecycle.  ""The leasing company will have a set of restrictions but everyone in the blockchain network may agree that the DMV can come in as an auditor. This permissioned ledger allows for companies that need to worry about data protection and data access,"" Cuomo explained.  Cuomo also addressed the role of a trusted cloud provider in the operation of blockchain services, given that, in many respects, blockchains were designed to eliminate the need for centralized or trusted parties.  ""At a casual glance, cloud can be viewed as an anti-pattern,"" Cuomo said. ""I’m not sure a better word but when you look at these standards that we’ve described, you can say this is a way to get the best out of cloud you can get the assurances that we can.""  Security in the cloud  Cuomo noted that the cloud is a particular focus for IBM business partners, many of whom he said are eager to move ahead with the production of blockchain systems.  ""We’ve been working with for a better part of a year [with some clients], and they’re looking for the next step in their blockchain journey,"" Cuomo continued. ""The top questions are around security, especially in the cloud environment. A set of standards must be present when you’re running a blockchain in a cloud.""  In particular, IBM encourages its customers to ask five questions when evaluating whether a cloud environment is right for the deployment of blockchain solutions.  These include whether there is secure key management; assurance protection to prevent data leaks; an auditable operations environment; the use of “optimized accelerators” to guard against reduced processor performance and whether the environment supports host administrators.  ""Without this level of iron-clad secure clouds, blockchain will remain just an experimental technology,"" the company stated.  Revenue play  For IBM, the move to the cloud is also strategic as company sees this, as well as its IBM Garage consulting services, as a way to monetize its work in blockchain.  However, Cuomo said the firm looks at its cloud offering as beneficial to developers, who he said will be able to provide the ideal environment where institutions can experiment.  ""There’s no better cost performance, meaning the time it takes me to vet my idea. Dedicated cloud makes a lot of sense, it gives you more efficiencies. I think what cloud does is it brings some level of order to the environment, while also delivering speed,"" he said.  The statements are notable given that IBM has already donated the code for the IBM Open Blockchain (OBC) to the Linux Foundation, which is overseeing the development of the Hyperledger Project, an open-source blockchain initiative currently underway.  OBC is one of three code bases, alongside contributions by startups Blockstream and Digital Asset Holdings, that have been merged for use in the project.  Still, Cuomo sought to position IBM as a company that was fundamentally interested in the future success of the open-source technology on which it is building, dubbing the company “the world’s first blockchain business”.  Cuomo pointed to IBM’s recent test of “shadowchains”, or blockchain systems that run alongside existing legacy systems, as an example of its belief the technology not only can solve real business problems, but is already doing so.  Cuomo concluded:  ""We’re not just talking the talk but walking the walk.""
