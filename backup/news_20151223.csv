42426604,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuNDh,1450895131,Why Blockchain's Road to Mass Market is Beyond Payments,"David GW Birch is Director of Consult Hyperion, the secure electronic transactions consultancy. He is an internationally-recognised thought leader in digital identity and digital money and was named by Wired magazine as one of their global top 15 favourite sources of business information.  From the perspective of the payments world, I think 2016 will see the trajectory of the blockchain shift and diverge.  To see why, let’s divide the payments roadmap into four areas and look at each of them individually to see how they interact with blockchain technology. These key areas are the technical, business, social and regulatory regions of the roadmap.  Technology Trends  There is no need to spend much time on the technology part of the road map because we can already see the important paths opening up: mobile everything, APIs for financial services and the blockchain will all develop throughout the year (irrespective of the specific evolution of bitcoin).  I don’t think I’m sticking my neck out to say that, along with Big Data and cybersecurity, they will all attract more investment from the mainstream financial institutions (and yes, blockchain will be attracting more investment from such institutions).  In our transaction-oriented corner of the world, we are rather into the ECB strong consumer authentication (SCA) drive and obviously that’s started to verge into biometrics.  Apple made the breakthrough of reframing biometrics in the mass market as a convenience technology rather than security technology. That’s been tremendously successful and it’s going to continue, so I expect we will see a jump in the use mass market consumer biometrics in the payments world.  Business Blockchains  When it comes to the business area, I think we can see the outlines of some of the key trends.  If you look at the breakdown of European bank income, you see pressure in all parts of the business. As a result, there is a premium on coming up with some new business models and sources of income, which is where blockchain is more likely to come into play.  I have a theory as to which one part of this might be, but let’s come back to that later.  Payments is not all about banks. I think it’s interesting to look at the non-banks and near-banks as well – especially the near-banks.  Near-banks are things that look like banks to consumers but aren't actually banks, taking specific niches in the marketplace. You’ve got Holvi and Moven and people like that in that space.  Then you have the non-banks such as Facebook, Google, Amazon and so on.  I think one underexamined group out there is retailers. Retailers haven’t really moved in that space yet (apart from the obvious example of Starbucks), and because retailers dominate the contacts with the customer, which ones choose to do in that space might turn out to be more significant.  The continuing shift toward in-app retailer solution adumbrates fundamental change in my opinion. I have said before that if blockchain will cause revolutionary change, it will be by managing dishwasher warranties rather than by overthrowing the Federal Reserve, and I stick by that opinion!  Social Segments  In the social area we have, broadly speaking, three groups to look at and respond to with new kinds of payment systems.  First, we have an aging population. I recently looked at a project that involved a facial recognition system. You run the bank app on your phone, and then to log in you look at the phone and it logs you in, which proved to be rather popular, not with toy obsessed millennials (they were quite happy use their fingerprints), but older people who can never remember passwords or PINs (eg: me). The new technology isn’t only for kids!  Then you’ve got the squeezed middle. These are people like me who have to catch the 7:52 from Woking in the morning and barely make it alive into Waterloo, scrabbling to keep up with things and very time poor. We need services that are delivered on the spot and within the correct context, and you will see that word “context"" appearing quite a lot in the offerings that are coming out next year.  Lastly, you have the mobile-centric millennials. For them, we have to drive payments into the channels that they use and make them vanish. In a Venmo world, a Facebook Messenger payments play is just as important as ChasePay or Walmart Pay or Samsung Pay or anything else.  Regulatory Rumbles  Finally, there are the regulatory trends.  In the payments world, these are by far the most important trends. It doesn’t matter if people come up with a super duper clever blockchain. It doesn’t matter if they come up with a niche way to sell it to millennials. It doesn’t matter if they come up with a terrific near-bank structure to make it all work, because actually, this is a regulated world, and regulatory trends set the envelope that they can work within.  Here I will just point out two key regulatory trends that I think the blockchain world might want to pay close attention to.  The first is what people have started to call 'instant payments'. In the UK, the faster payment service (FPS) is well established, has been fantastically successful and is enabling things on top of it already like Pingit and Paym and so on. And there’s more to come in that space.  That is also happening in other countries have started to take that route. The one great exception was always the US because the Federal Reserve has no regulatory mandate to make the banks there implement an instant payment system, and so we all thought it would be some time before instant payments appeared in the US.  Actually, however, in the last couple of months, there has been raft of announcements coming out of the US: The Clearing House (TCH) is working with VocaLink, Dwolla are experimenting with APIs, NACHA is moving to same day, and so on.  Even in the US, instant payments will feature heavily across the next year. Once you can send money instantly from one person to another in this way, bitcoin will have to work hard to find a payments niche for the typical customer.  The second is the 2nd European Payment Services Directive, PSD2. This mandates that (amongst other things) banks have to provide open APIs to third parties by 2018. The EBA has set out three categories of those APIs:  The mandatory payment APIs which all banks will have to implement so that regulated third parties can have direct access for account information and for transaction initiation  The non-mandatory payment APIs which banks will be allowed to offer so that they can provide some unique special services, trade finance or FX  The non-mandatory, non-payment APIs.  I would say that if a European blockchain entrepreneur wants to look for an opportunity to make something really interesting, really different, and really special in this space, you should be looking at, not payment services, but the services that go around them – the valued-added propositions alongside payments.  Hence my advice to our clients to look at the non-mandatory, non-payment APIs. Blockchain plays can use these APIs to create new services with, for (or in spite of!) banks to embrace and extend services. To my mind, the most important of these will be around identity management and authentication services, and I predict that a lot of our work next year will be in this area.  Hence my 2016 bumper sticker for the readers: “Blockchain is #regtech not #fintech”.  Want to share your opinion on bitcoin or blockchain in 2015, or a prediction for the year ahead?

42426621,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuNbh,1450867168,CoinDesk's Most Influential People in Bitcoin and Blockchain 2015,"As we look back over yet another fascinating year for bitcoin, it's natural to assess the individuals that helped influence the industry.  This year, of course, it's not just about bitcoin anymore: the technology underlying bitcoin, the blockchain, has taken own a life of its own, with institutional interest in blockchains almost reaching a frenzy. In a development that would have seemed almost impossible a year ago, banks and major financial institutions are starting up blockchain projects to probe the possibilities of the technology.  The industry needs influencers to point the way on technical or regulatory issues, to build awareness, to dream up revolutionary new solutions to serious global problems and to build elegant new enterprises to take this exciting emerging tech to the masses.  We had our own ideas as to who those people were in 2015 and we also asked you, the public, to give us your opinions in our reader poll.  For this year's top 10 list, we took into account the year's biggest events, the nominees' individual contributions to the community and the results of our poll.  So, who reached the top 10 this year? Read on to find out...  10. Bobby Lee  The CEO of Shanghai-based bitcoin exchange BTCC (previously BTC China), Lee has been influential in helping bridge east-west divide in the bitcoin community.  Lee often appears at conferences and recently played a significant part in the ongoing scalability debate, translating and moderating at the Scaling Bitcoin Workshop to ensure China-based miners could talk to Western developers.  His prominence is such that he can make headlines as easily as anyone in the bitcoin space, and his popularity with the community saw him voted to the Bitcoin Foundation's Board of Directors.  9. Blythe Masters  There has been a lot of talk about the scarcity of women in tech, and the bitcoin space still has work to do. Blythe Masters, however, is a notable exception, being the highest-profile finance executive in the blockchain space, and arguably, the industry at large.  Masters was the global commodities chief at JP Morgan Chase and is now CEO of Digital Asset Holdings (DA), a firm providing settlement and ledger services for digital assets.  Her expertise and prominence has seen her make the cover of Bloomberg Businessweek, while her startup has made the most acquisitions in the space and is rumoured to have received funding from JP Morgan and Santander.  While Masters is not exactly a fan of bitcoin (she's been publicly of both minds about the matter), she has done as much as anyone to promote blockchain technology on Wall Street, even turning down a job running Barclays' investment bank to stay at DA.  8. Balaji Srinivasan  Srinivasan is the head of 21 Inc, a once-secretive startup that long accrued vast amounts of VC cash even while few people outside the company had any idea of its business plan.  In March, however, 21 finally made global headlines when it was revealed that it had raised a total of $116m, the most of any bitcoin firm – ever. This raised the question, what was its amazing product or service going to be?  At last, in May, leaked documents revealed tests that showed 21's technology could enable machine-to-machine bitcoin transactions that could be used to, say, facilitate real-time marketplaces for Internet bandwidth.  All was quiet for a period, until it finally released a product, a small-scale mining device called the Bitcoin Computer, which began shipping on Amazon in November.  Lodged patents  hint at more to come, but many believe the 21 Bitcoin Computer will be the start of a new wave of developer innovation in the industry.  For raising the profile of bitcoin across the globe and bringing a mass bitcoin device to a major outlet, Srinivasan has certainly been an influence in 2015.  7. Theymos  A divisive figure in the bitcoin community, Theymos is the pseudonym for one of the moderators of Reddit's bitcoin forum, r/Bitcoin.  His style of moderation has generated controversy due to perceived strict and opinionated policy rules and alleged censorship, with one user suggesting jokingly Theymos would possibly ban Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin's inventor.  Things got so bad that other entrepreneurs have tried to displace r/Bitcoin as the industry's main discussion board forum.  Bitcoin evangelist Roger Ver, sometimes called 'Bitcoin Jesus', started Bitcoin.com forum partly to provide an alternative site for discussion, and another reddit forum, r/btc, was launched. Then there's the unlaunched DATT initiative, which is aiming to decentralize Reddit altogether.  Whether you agree with Theymos' style, he has undoubtedly had an influence on the community and its discussions, though this influence is likely to be challenged again next year.  6. Gavin Andresen  With the bitcoin community currently engrossed in a serious technical debate about how to best alter the code to allow greater numbers of transactions, the network's long-time maintainer has unsurprisingly taken a leading role in the conversation.  Andresen was outspoken with his view that capacity should be drastically expanded – and quickly.  The programmer took to forums to enthusiastically push his case for Bitcoin XT, a new client designed as a way for miners to vote away bitcoin's current 1MB block size limit.  While the plan continues to be debated, the manner in which Andresen introduced the idea proved divisive, with the sudden release of Bitcoin XT causing its fair share of exaggerated, and negative, headlines.  For his regular involvement in the bitcoin community and work on bitcoin's code, Andresen was also in last year's list, where he placed fifth.  5. Vitalik Buterin  Despite his youth, Buterin has already built an impressive resume in the digital currency industry, having been involved in several notable projects outside of his initial editorial endeavour, Bitcoin Magazine.  After participating in the creation of Dark Wallet and KryptoKit, the Toronto native founded Ethereum – a specialized blockchain network for decentralized applications.  Given his role as figurehead of the project, Buterin also a regular on the conference circuit and was one of the four individuals to appear on last year's Most Influential poll, where he placed sixth.  However, 2015 was arguably more important for the crowdfunded project, which after sky-high expectations was met with delays and consistent rumors of behind-the-scenes difficulties.  Still, Ethereum has persevered, with the project throwing a marquee event in London to showcase the enterprise interest in its now live, though still early-stage tech, and becoming the home to a number of new startups.  In short, 2015 was a year in which Ethereum really had to prove itself, and though it's still early, it's safe to say it's become an integral part of industry conversation.  4. Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam  The co-founders of Coinbase have done as much as anyone to help take bitcoin mainstream, with their user-friendly international exchange and wallet platform providing a simple way for non-techy people to buy, hold and use bitcoin.  But as their startup develops, Armstrong and Ehrsam have shown an increasing willingness to exert their position as industry thought leaders.  This year, Armstrong and Ehrsam became more comfortable using their company blog and social media presence to promote their ideas on how they believe bitcoin needs to move forward.  In the process, they weren't scared to flag what they felt was poor media coverage of the technology or promote bitcoin over altcoins.  While Coinbase gets some community criticism on social platforms for its strict adherence to global regulations, the pair have certainly done their bit for bitcoin.  3. Wences Casares  The CEO of bitcoin security startup Xapo, Wences Casares continues to be one of the bigger celebrities in the bitcoin and blockchain industry.  More notable is that this attention comes in spite of the fact that Xapo has remained relatively quiet in 2015. The startup released few new products and services this year, and is now engrossed in a lawsuit with the former employer of a number of its key executives.  But while Casares has been quiet on the business front, his evangelical talks receive widespread coverage, even for non-news announcements, and he will tell anyone who will listen about how bitcoin can change the world.  The Argentinian entrepreneur is even credited with spreading the word about the digital currency throughout Silicon Valley and reticent financiers on Wall Street – a mission which, he has said, drew laughter from skeptics.  2. Brian Forde  Since being brought in to head MIT's Digital Currency Initiative (DCI) this April, the ex-White House senior advisor has made great strides in highlighting the benefits of bitcoin and the blockchain to those both inside and outside of the prestigious university.  As part of MIT Media Lab, the DCI is now seeking to engage other departments in its work, whether its with its School of Engineering or School of Broadcasting & Journalism, so that a new generation of young minds is exposed to the emerging technology.  Though his public presence has since been more subdued of late, Forde hit the ground running, talking widely of the need to promote the technology in a way that people can understand while setting out the DCI's goals.  This year, he has also harnessed the power of the MIT brand to bring the technology to groups that have been historically underrepresented in industry conversations and been outspoken on subjects such as New York state's BitLicense regulations.  1. Satoshi Nakamoto  The pseudonym for the much-discussed genius (or geniuses) that invented bitcoin once again proved his or her vast influence over the industry this year.  With Wired's and Gizmodo's 'revelations' that Craig Wright, an Australian entrepreneur, was the much sought-after Nakamoto, bitcoin's elusive creator showcased just how much attention he can generate for the technology.  Even in a week when the industry produced its most widely acclaimed proposal to address scalability and its oldest trade organisation seemed ready to collapse, Nakamoto overshadowed all other developments.  What followed has become somewhat of a predictable script.  Pundits argued Nakamoto's true identity doesn't matter, while other media outlets sought to uncover flaws in the emerging evidence. Regardless, the conversation soon spread beyond the bitcoin community to mainstream publications the world over.  But while often branded as ""bitcoin's creator"", Nakamoto is also the inventor of its decentralised ledger, the blockchain. And even as big banks seem increasingly keen to harness the power of ""the technology"", Nakamoto and his or her invention remains at the center of conversation, earning the number one spot in our poll.  Honorable mentions  There were many other notable individuals who played their part in the bitcoin and blockchain over the last year.  The following 10 individuals also received impressive numbers of votes from our community: Andreas Antonopoulos (bitcoin advocate and author); Dan Morehead (Pantera Capital CEO); Mike Hearn (R3CEV chief platform officer); Chris Larsen (CEO at Ripple Labs); Barry Silbert (CEO at Digital Currency Group); Roger Ver (angel investor); The Blockstream developers; Elizabeth Rossiello (CEO at BitPesa); Tim Swanson (director of market research at R3CEV).
