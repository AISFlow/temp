42430064,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM3bph,1545174908,Institutional Crypto and a New Generation of Wall Street Leaders,"Donna Redel is an angel investor focusing on financial technology, blockchain and emerging technologies. She's a professor of blockchain and a former chairman at the Commodity Exchange.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  If there's any doubt institutions are moving fast on crypto asset adoption, take it from a teacher.  In developing the syllabus for Fordham Law and Gabelli School of Business, which both offered my new course on blockchains and crypto assets, I was all too aware of the dramatic changes the industry underwent. The ever-shifting landscape and break-neck pace meant that the class, the guest speakers and myself had to remain nimble, adjusting on an almost weekly basis to innovations in technology and regulatory issues.  We were witnessing and learning in real time as the SEC and CFTC officials made speeches, issued settlements or statements that would shape the industry.  Yet, as we head into 2019, I'm reminded that our industry faces even more urgent questions:  How will the marketplace find ways to employ digital assets in risk management?  Is there an overarching framework, a consistent set of standards and terminology for the industry to subscribe to?  Is the movement to institutional acceptance fundamentally at odds with decentralization?  What are the market opportunities?  What role is regulation having in the migration to institutionalization?  Still more important, however, will be a larger question that will define all of the above: Who are our leaders leading the charge to institutional adoption of digital assets?  This answer may prove critical to overcoming the challenge of attaining broad institutional acceptance.  The long move toward digitization  In order to put the dramatic changes of 2018 into context, consider the historical perspective.  In 1992, I was elected Chairman of The Commodity Exchange where during my tenure it merged into the NYMEX to create the largest physical commodity exchange. At that time, the exchanges occupied a 50,000-square-foot column-less trading floor, populated with thousands of people in brightly colored trading jackets, screaming and waving their arms violently to buy or sell a commodity – things such as gold, silver, oil, sugar, orange juice.  If you never had the occasion to visit a vibrant trading floor watch the movie ""Trading Places"" with Eddie Murphy to get the gist. Though it may seem crazy or inefficient now, those people were doing the work that computers do today. The exchange floor was first and foremost a community, a network, a beehive of activity where millions of transactions occurred and every player had a defined place in an economic ecosystem.  Electronic order books have since replaced bits of papers with scribbled buy and sell orders, but the fundamental rationale for the market and its players remains intact, which is to transfer risk and to provide liquidity for institutional users.  The COMEX-NYMEX merger  in 1994 was the first consolidation of the exchanges that began the process of unlocking value, and of rethinking how to be competitive in the approaching age of data availability, computerization and global technological competition. It was a big step toward new product development and the growth of derivatives.  Fast forward to today and many things are not essentially different.  When we think about advancing the use of crypto and digital assets, it is helpful to draw on history. The invention of financial products or asset classes is a complex art. But the adoption of the product and growth of the marketplace takes perseverance and leadership by individuals building out the ecosystem step-by-step for institutional acceptance.  Here again, historical examples can provide insight for developing digital assets and tokens markets.  Dr. Richard Sandor, considered the father of financial futures, helped grow both OTC market participation and the exchanges by speaking to all the potential stakeholders day in and day out. In the most affectionate of ways, I think of Richard going door-to-door selling financially engineered products and educating people about how they can transform risk management as well as investing. He convinced one person at a time, one institution at a time to step in and to build a marketplace. The Chairman of the CFTC recently cited Sandor’s new blockchain book twice in a single speech.  In the early 1980s, the great Leo Melamed literally dragged traders into the S&P pit to spend their quota of time making markets in what became known as ""Leo's folly."" It became the most successful of contracts.  The lesson? Leaders are dedicated, trusted and patient individuals who build a community to expand the marketplace.  Centralized decentralization  Still, in electing this leadership we also need to be conscious of values. In 2018, the move towards institutional utilization came with a step away from decentralization – the core value-add of blockchain-based systems.  Crypto contracts opened on the CME and the CBOE, and ICE put forth its new entrant Bakkt. All are highly centralized marketplaces that institutional players support and trust. Yet, there is no peer-to-peer trading or settlement as in the decentralized models of crypto trading.  But as the market gains traction we should be reminded of the need to reimagine exchange structure and the promise of decentralization for digital assets, and that we need leaders who can help steer us toward this greater goal.  Already, innovative companies with devoted leadership teams are working together to grow the economic understanding of digital assets, to develop functional products and to build the complicated infrastructure. As we move towards institutional digital assets, new partnerships are being developed, frameworks are being built and alliances forged.  In 2018, the digital asset industry began step-by-step an educational framework for the institutional marketplace as well as for the regulators and also began to produce thought leadership initiatives based on scholarly work. I recommend the following selection: the tokenomics work of Prysm’s Cathy Barrera and Stephanie Hurder; the blockchain research of Carnegie Mellon’s Giulia Fanti; Todd Lippiatt and Michael Oved’s new approach to real estate tokens (tokenwaterfall.io); and the cutting-edge legal work of The Brooklyn Project as well as that of Aaron Wright’s openlaw.io.  On the partnership side, Fluidity announced deals with Securitize, Propellr and GenesisBlock, all since October 2018. Vincent Molinari (of Templum) and SeedInvest (newly merged with Circle) are continuing to lead the way to ease regulation for crowdfunding.  In 2019, we can expect to see mergers and alliances that position firms to offer digital-asset products to institutional investors and to provide creative solutions aimed at building infrastructure and an efficient liquid security token market. The dynamic partnership and configurations within blockchain and a wider set of industries will produce leaders that drive change.  But my hope is to see continued leadership from a new generation of empowered entrepreneurs who can perform a leadership role similar to Sandor, Melamed or myself, driving the process of the institutionalization of crypto-digital assets, and continuing the long-running digitization of finance, already decades in the making.  It is noteworthy and without historical precedent that in 2019 women in leadership positions will have key roles in driving the process of the institutionalization of crypto assets. I look forward to seeing what these women in power will do and say in 2019: Abigail Johnson, CEO of Fidelity Investments; Kelly Loeffler, CEO of Bakkt, Adena Friedman, CEO of Nasdaq; Stacey Cunningham, President of NYSE; Hester Peirce, Commissioner of the SEC; and Valerie Szczepanik, SEC Senior Advisor for Digital Assets and Innovation.  I, the first woman chair of an exchange, feel hopeful and certainly in good company.  Have an opinionated take on 2018? CoinDesk is seeking submissions for our 2018 in Review.

The company announced Tuesday that Masters will remain as a shareholder, strategic advisor and member of the company's board of directors, but that she would vacate her position as chief executive for personal reasons. The departure was first reported by Fortune.  In a note to employees sent earlier today, Masters wrote that ""working as part of the DA family means the world to me, but I also work for my family's future and I need to focus on this for a while.""  Masters will be temporarily replaced by AG Gangadhar, who joined the firm's board this past April and has been appointed as its chairman. He will serve as acting CEO while the company looks for a new chief executive, according to a press release.  In a statement, Masters said the company has ""evolved"" from being an idea to operating as a technology firm worldwide. She praised Gangadhar, saying:  ""We are fortunate to have a deep bench of accomplished executives on the management team and Board, including AG, who have the requisite experience to take the company to the next level. Having come to know and trust AG as an advisor and Board member, I am convinced that he brings what’s needed to guide the company through its next phase.""  Gangadhar has previously worked at Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Cruise (GM) and Uber, according to the release.  Masters  began leading Digital Asset in 2015, the year after it was first founded. The firm has since grown to work with companies including the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, Google Cloud and the Australian Securities Exchange.  Michael Bodson, president and CEO of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation and member of the Digital Asset board, thanked Masters in a statement, saying ""her leadership and vision ... has propelled the company from a promising startup to a globally recognized leader in DLT. We are excited to have a world-renowned technologist like [Gangadhar] to help take the company forward.""  Blythe Masters on stage at the DC Blockchain Summit, March 2015.

The shares represents Medicis's 29.6 percent stake in the startup, worth $3.6 million. They mark Chainstone's first step in venturing into the security token market, which itself is in the inception phase. Medici is gearing up to launch a security token marketplace in January with its own tZERO token as a primary traded asset.  Chainstone is led by Bruce Fenton, CEO at the Atlantic Financial Blockchain Labs, founder of The Satoshi Roundtable conference and a board member of Medici.  ""We believe that digital securities are a far superior model to old ways of moving securities. Since this is our business focus it’s a natural fit to have our own equity digitized into a securities token,"" Fenton told CoinDesk through a spokesperson.  According to him, the startup issued 12.4 million digital shares, named CHAINSTONE.  The token was issued on the Ravencoin blockchain. Fenton, as well as Medici principal software developer Tron Black and chief technology officer Joel Weight co-authored the platform's white paperhttps://ravencoin.org/Ravencoin.pdf, and are active contributors, he said.  The network, designed to support peer-to-peer asset transactions, was launched in January.  Fenton said:  ""For these shares Ravencoin was a perfect choice. Ravencoin was specifically designed for digital assets. It has several advantages over other platforms because it benefits from the security and salability of the Bitcoin code base.""  That said, Chainstone as a company plans to support projects with ERC-20 tokens, Blockstream's Liquid and other platforms going forward, Fenton added.  Blockchain-based shares will make transactions ""faster, more secure, and completely transparent will change the world,” Medici Ventures president Jonathan Johnson said in a press release.  He told CoinDesk that there are no current plans to make the token tradable on tZERO, ""but this is still an early stage company."" So far, the token is not open to the public, according to Medici.  Medici plans to have its security token trading platform, tZERO, up and running in January. The platform has also announced that it is developing a security token for cobalt sales, commissioned by the Hong Kong-based company GSR Capital.

Back in 2016, he led a $4.2 million series A funding round in Texas-based company Factom, aimed at building a number of new products for its blockchain data network.

42430056,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM3bLh,1545146158,Documents Suggest Tether Has Fiat Funds to Back Stablecoin: Report,"A new report seeks to shine a light on one of the prevailing questions surrounding Tether Ltd., the company behind the dollar-pegged stablecoin USDT: whether it has cash reserves to back up its 1.8 billion tokens.  Bloomberg News reportedhttps://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2018-12-18/crypto-mystery-clues-suggest-tether-has-the-billions-it-promised Tuesday that it has seen Tether bank statements indicating that, over four separate months at least, the company held sufficient dollars to back the tether (USDT) tokens on the market.  While the report, which CoinDesk cannot confirm, does not provide the reassurance of a full audit by a specialist firm, it appear to provide evidence that Tether's token – used by many crypto traders and exchanges to move value internationally – is backed by more than just claims from the firm, at least during certain windows of time.  Bloomberg said it has seen documents from September 2017 suggesting that Tether had $452.9 million in accounts at Noble Bank, Puerto Rico, and Bank of Montreal. At the end of that month, the firm had 435 million USDT in circulation. Bank statements for several other non-consecutive months also indicated its dollar reserves matched tokens on the market, says Bloomberg.  Tether had previously promised a full audit of its dollar holdings and had hired auditing firm Friedman LLP to that end, yet that relationship was dissolved in January 2017 without a full explanation and without any audit forthcoming.  Departing Noble Bank early in October 2018, the firm moved to use the services of Bahamas-based Deltec Bank and Trust Limited. It soon after released a letter dated Nov 1 from Deltec, stating “the portfolio cash value of your account with our bank was US$1,831,322,828” as of Oct. 31.  The lack of a clear audit of reserves has caused much discussion and controversy, both within the crypto community and without, since Tether effectively acts as a bank for exchanges that are not provided traditional banking services.  Tether and its sister firm, crypto exchange Bitfinex, have also been accused of manipulating the price of bitcoin using USDT. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) was reportedly focusing a months-long investigation into crypto market manipulation on the tether stablecoin on Nov. 20, Bloomberg suggested at the time.  The two firms were also reportedly subpoenaed by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in December 2017 to ascertain their levels of fiat reserves.  Amid all the controversy, traders appeared to lose faith in the USDT token causing it to briefly lose its 1:1 dollar parity in mid-October, slipping to a value of low of $0.92. The firm soon after issued a statement, stressing ""all USDT in circulation are sufficiently backed by U.S. dollars"" and ""assets have always exceeded liabilities.""At press time, USDT is trading at $1.01, according to CoinMarketCap.

Led by Arthur Ventures, the round also saw CoVenture Crypto, Digital Currency Group, BitGo co-founder Ben Davenport, CityBlock Capital, King Capital, Polymath and TokenSoft participating.  Nomics CEO and co-founder Clay Collins told CoinDesk that, at present, almost every employee at the startup works on development full-time. That reflects the immense amount of data Nomics is trying to index, he said, explaining:  ""While it's a fairly trivial task to price (and have listings for) 95 [percent] of all cryptoassets, getting raw ticks/trades, all on-chain data, and orderbook data (including historical order book) for these assets can prove to be quite an engineering challenge.""  Exacerbating the challenge is the fact that the team is looking to provide ""gapless data,"" which normalizes the information to account for different time zones, ticker symbols, offline market protocols and other data variations, Collins said.  Users can access the data using the Nomics API, which provides both historical and real-time financial data on different tokenized assets. This data can include price quotes and trading indicators, and seeks to unite the data from different exchanges.  There will be ""millions of new pages available"" after the information is indexed, according to Collins.  ""With regards to the API/data product for businesses and institutions, it will look like more API endpoints, more data behind existing endpoints, lower latency, improved documentation, as well as more aggregate data/indicators (like quote currency dominance and future supply simulation),"" he said.  The service will also provide the ability to analyze or follow individual orders, too. The aim is ultimately that hedge funds and other investors should be able to utilize this data in developing trading algorithms and tracking market fluctuations.  Nomics has already indexed more than 3.5 billion data points, and sees roughly 35 million API calls each month, according to provided figures.

42402358,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd43jy,1545134416,Amazon Plays Its Own Game With Enterprise Blockchain,"Amazon Web Services, the e-commerce giant’s cloud computing arm, is having its proverbial blockchain cake and eating it, too.  In late November, AWS unveiled a new service during its re:Invent event that lets clients build their own cloud-based blockchains, using Hyperledger Fabric or ethereum as templates for such projects.  That announcement was the next step in a long-running process that has seen the cloud giant continuing to dip its toes ever-deeper into the blockchain pond. Previously, AWS showed its hand by striking partnerships with firms like bank-backed startup R3 and, later, the ConsenSys-tied Kaleido. With Amazon Managed Blockchain, AWS was clearly trying to take that one step further – but at the same time, the cloud services company isn’t making any claims that all of its clients will benefit from using blockchain.  Indeed, according to Rahul Pathak, AWS’ general manager for big data, data lakes and blockchain, conversations with its customers led Amazon to the conclusion that blockchain isn’t some kind of panacea, but is rather suited for specific business problems that many clients simply don’t encounter.  “You can imagine a large manufacturer who wants all of its partners to write on its ledger about trading items through its network,” Pathak explained. In such cases, a “blockchain network brings in an unnecessary complexity, because you don’t need the distributed trust or the consensus elements.”  Amazon’s conference saw another cloud offering – Amazon Quantum Ledger Database, or QLDB – take the stage. That offering is being marketed as a radically easier way to build cryptographically protected databases, and Amazon is betting that in some cases, customers will prefer that to any kind of blockchain solution.  “Some customers wanted an immutable ledger, but centralized trust was ok, and for that we have QLDB, and some wanted an immutable ledger, but also decentralized trust, and that’s where Amazon Managed Blockchain came into play,” Pathak explained.  Ledger selections  That sense of pragmatism – that some companies don’t need a distributed database or simply aren’t interested in blockchain – extends to the top of AWS’ ranks.  As CEO Andy Jassy said during his keynote speech at the re:Invent: “We just hadn’t seen that many blockchain examples in production or that couldn’t pretty easily be solved by a database.”  In fact, AWS is stating that blockchain is not needed for the most touted enterprise blockchain use cases. Even still, some of AWS’ clients – a list that boasts some notable enterprise-level names – are giving the blockchain platform a try.  This list includes communication giant Verizon, electronics manufacturer Philips, clearing and settlement provider DTCC, aircraft engine supplier GE Aviation, insurance companies Liberty Mutual and Guardian Life, software vendor Workday and healthcare technology provider Change Healthcare. Their logos can be seen on the Amazon Managed Blockchain website.  For these early participants, only a preview is available so far, and in case of the managed blockchain, it’s Hyperledger Fabric. Ethereum will also become available in the coming months, Pathak told CoinDesk, but the exact dates are not public.  According to Daniel Johnson, CTO and head of innovation at Guardian Life, testing the AWS’ product is part of its ongoing experiment with blockchain systems that the company has been conducting since 2015. This process has included the development of private blockchain prototypes using ethereum, Hyperledger, and some of the options available on Microsoft Azure.  As Guardian has been using other Amazon’s services for several years now, trying this one seemed logical — and more rational than joining a consortium and running their own node, Johnson told CoinDesk.  “We’d rather have a large provider and let them administer lower-level technical services. Amazon becomes a trusted third party instead of us going into a consortium where you have to worry about that person leaving or another person joining. We’d rather have a technology company that has financial stability and is really performing well, and rely on them,” Johnson said.  Addressing the security concern of vulnerable data sitting outside the company’s venue in the AWS cloud, he said that actually, such a solution is viewed by Guardian as a more secure one.  “If there is a country that wants to hack your system, Amazon has pretty extensive security measures, different controls in place, they can do it a lot better than any enterprise,” Johnson said.  If this is the thinking of other Amazon clients testing the new cloud service (the other seven firms didn’t provide detailed answers about it), and given that Amazon is now a dominant cloud service provider in the world (with 41.5 percent of the market, according to a report by Cloud Security Alliance), the product might be a formidable competition to the existing blockchain consortia, the first ones of which have recently gone live.  Inking relationships  Curiously enough, Amazon has recently partnered with a number of blockchain solutions providers, but the new products have been developed exclusively by the AWS team, Pathak told CoinDesk.  Back in 2017, Amazon hosted Corda on its marketplace, allowing customers to deploy and use dApps on the R3-developed blockchain.  In May, another partnership was announced with the ConsenSys-backed startup Kaleido, which builds enterprise blockchains on ethereum. However, both Pathak and Kaleido co-founder Sophia Lopez told CoinDesk that Kaleido wasn’t involved in the development of the ethereum part of Managed Blockchain.  “Kaleido is working with us across the number of other areas, their focus is bringing their own service to the AWS customers,” Pathak told CoinDesk. Asked if there will be competition between Amazon’s own service for building ethereum-based enterprise blockchains and Kaleido’s, he said he didn’t believe that was the case.  “It’s still very early, and there will be plenty of opportunities for customers to work with any of us or both of us,” Pathak said.  Lopez told CoinDesk that the partnership with AWS has been a productive one, helping create more than 1,500 blockchain networks with Kaleido’s service at AWS. But the Amazon's own ethereum offering of the Managed Blockchain will be only “five to ten percent” of the solutions clients need to run a blockchain, she said.  Other necessary parts are the constellation of identity, key management, business process modeling services, smart contracts instruments and other tools around the blockchain technology itself. As Lopez said: “Clients need a lot more help.”  “So far AWS has only a template, or a script for one-time initial deployment [for ethereum],” she explained. “It’s one small step forward. They are trying to catch up with other vendors who have been offering something like this over the last year or two.”  But what about blockchain?  While the approach may be winning plaudits from enterprises, participants on the AWS subreddit recently struck skeptical tones during an AMA in late November after the twin services were launched.  A user going by the handle alsomahler noted that users won’t be able to do anything in case their transaction record gets changed: “You can't prove that merely by using a blockchain. It's possible for you to fork at an earlier block and included transactions in a new history of blocks. Obviously, a user could keep track of the block hashes themselves, but even then, they can't prove it in court. Do you have mechanisms to make this more difficult?”  Another one reminded about the core principles of blockchain: “Why should we trust a centralized authority? The core virtue of distributed ledgers is the avoidance of centralized authorities. Central point of control = not trustworthy.”  To these and similar arguments, AWS’ answer was that “customers building on QLDB will trust that AWS is faithfully executing their SQL statements to update the current and history views of their data. But once the journal transactions are published, they cannot be changed even by AWS without detection.”  Pathak added that QLDB is designed for the use cases when there is a trusted authority recognized by all participants and centralization is not an issue.  “What QLDB provides is you will be able to verify that the ledger has not been changed or forked, otherwise you will be able to detect it,” he explained.  Another question is the viability of the systems that allow users to use blockchains without running nodes, making the process radically easier but opening a single point of failure as there is a centralized provider of hardware. Event public blockchains face this problem, like ethereum, in which a service called Infura handles a significant share of transactions.  Pathak says that Amazon makes efforts to guarantee the resilience of its services and “invests a lot of resources to make sure the system stays available in case of different failures.”  Another way to solve this problem for blockchain projects is to include nodes not hosted at AWS, Pathak said, suggesting that, in the end, some decentralization still might be needed.

42402364,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd43qr,1545133203,Bitcoin Price Jumps 10% on Anniversary of All-Time High,"Bitcoin (BTC) could be in for a stronger recovery rally ahead of New Year as the recent major sell-off looks to be fading.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value had been trading near $3,200 early yesterday, representing an 83 percent drop from the record high of $20,000 reached the same date in 2017.  However, BTC, which had been ignoring extreme oversold conditions for weeks and struggling to pick up a bid, suddenly jumped to an eight-day high of $3,590 from around 12:00 UTC. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $3,450 on Bitstamp.  With the bounce, BTC has not only validated the oversold readings on the 14-week relative strength index (RSI), but also established a bullish reversal pattern on the widely followed three-day chart.  3-day chart  BTC has created a bullish outside reversal candle, meaning the price action seen during the three days to Dec. 17 engulfed the previous three-day candle’s high and low.  The candlestick pattern suggests that the time span began pessimistically, but ended on an optimistic note. It is widely considered an early sign of bullish reversal, especially when the pattern appears at the bottom of the downtrend.  A bearish-to-bullish trend change, however, would only be confirmed if the current three-day candle ends (Thursday’s UTC close) above $3,590 (high of the bullish outside candle).  Further, the relative strength index (RSI) has created a bullish divergence (higher low) in oversold territory below 30.00. Trading volumes have also dropped in the last two weeks, signaling that sellers have run out of steam.  As a result of all this, BTC looks likely to rise well above $3,590 ahead of Thursday’s close.  Daily chart  BTC closed on the daily chart yesterday at $3,596, confirming both a falling wedge breakout – a bullish reversal pattern – and a bullish divergence of the 14-day RSI.  The 5- and 10-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) have also bottomed out.  BTC could therefore attack the recent lower high of $3,633 in the next few days and extend gains toward $4,000.  View  Bullish indicators on both the 3-day and daily charts likely indicate that the tide has turned away the bears, at least for the short-term.  BTC looks set to cross the resistance at $3,633 (Dec. 9 high) and could rise toward the psychological hurdle of $4,000 in the next few days.  The short-term bullish setup would be invalidated if BTC finds acceptance below Monday's low of $3,181.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

Announced Tuesday, the country’s Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning and the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries have launched a blockchain pilot project to see if the tech can help the nations container shipping industry become more efficient.  Starting this month, the trial will be conducted at the major southern port of Busan over the next year. Using blockchain tech, the project is aimed to increase transparency between parties in the shipping process, allow real-time sharing of information and ultimately improve import and export business operations.  If the pilot proves a success, the two ministries expect to expand the blockchain tech to other ports and areas in the country.  The marine logistics project is one of six pilots announced by the South Korean government back in June, with a planned total investment of $9 million for the series. The other five areas of investigation cover livestock supply chain management, customs clearance, online voting, real-estate transactions and cross-border e-document distribution.  “We will establish a roadmap for developing blockchain technology and plan to secure 90 percent of the technology level by 2022 compared to the world’s top countries,” the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning said at the time.  Next year, the government may actually double the number of blockchain pilots in the public sector. It also plans to support at least three private-led national blockchain projects.  Last month, the body governing South Korean lawyers, the Korean Bar Association also called on the government to hasten the introduction of blockchain regulations in the country to help develop the tech industry and protect investors.

42402356,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd43kx,1545123644,"Crypto Is Far From Dead, as These Scaling Projects Show","Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.    -------    After a gloomy look at the state of cryptoland two weeks ago, it’s time for more of a glass-half-full assessment of the outlook.  As we’ve been hearing, one advantage of a bear market, when price is less of a distraction and competition for engineering talent isn’t so tight, is that serious projects can buckle down and start to develop real products. The question, then, is whether there are any serious projects for developers to work on?  The answer, resoundingly, is yes.  The big challenge for blockchain development is scaling: how to resolve the tradeoff between decentralization and efficiency that bitcoin and ethereum ran into once every node in the network had to process and record an ever-growing string of transactions.  Overcoming this scaling challenge, so that many more transactions can be processed without raising security risks or overly trusting specific record-keeping entities, is vital because it will pave the way for other improvements, including lower costs, more application-layer software products, and improved user experience.  The good news is that there’s a great deal of work going on. And whereas previous new blockchain projects that touted massive transaction-processing power were limited to “permissioned” networks, the work being done now goes to the heart of a more exciting scaling goal: a dramatic increase in the capacity of open, permissionless platforms.  Layer one and layer two  Much of the focus has been on the work being done among bitcoin and ethereum developers to resolve this challenge.  In bitcoin’s case, scaling was the subject of an ugly dispute between those favoring a block-size increase — an on-chain “Layer One” solution backed by advocates of breakaway cryptocurrency bitcoin cash – and those, such as the Bitcoin Core developers, who preferred off-chain “Layer Two” solutions such as the Lightning Network payment channels model.  While the block size increase solution at bitcoin cash deteriorated into an ugly battle among proponents, Lightning has shown significantly more progress. According to data from 1ml.com, the Lightning mainnet now counts more than 4,400 nodes and more than 13,500 payment channels, with those two metrics having increased by 10.45% and 43.5%, respectively, over the course of the same month. Even as the bitcoin price collapsed, work just continued building the network.  The ethereum community’s approach to scaling has been more cohesive than bitcoin’s, but it has also embraced a more ambitious agenda. The scaling roadmap includes a shift to proof-of-stake consensus under the Casper project, as well as ethereum’s own layer one and layer two solutions.  For layer one, the focus is on sharding, which splits the blockchain into different, interlinked portions, so that the processing requirements for each node can be lessened. And the layer two work includes Lightning-like state channels such as the Raiden Network and the “child chain” model on which Plasma is based.  The complexity of these amendments, as well as the fact that some of these changes, especially on-chain protocol adjustments, require coordination among ethereum’s relatively large user and developer base, has meant that target dates for launch of the various stages have been pushed back repeatedly. However, a new plan aims to accelerate the introduction of the changes.  In any case, the wider blockchain community should be thankful to ethereum for the enormous amount of thought and planning that has gone into these ambitious solutions. The Github repo for ethereum sharding work, for example, now stands as a resource for all to work on this promising solution.  Standing on the shoulders of giants  It might seem a bit unfair that, as these more established blockchain communities have worked hard at these solutions, newcomers have been able to build on some of their ideas and launch new permissionless protocols from scratch that incorporate these and other scaling solutions.  There’s still a lot of catching up to do – both in terms of network size and developer engagement. As CoinDesk’s newly created Crypto Economics Explorer, or CEX, shows, bitcoin and ethereum are well ahead of all other blockchains on both those metrics.  Some of these projects have been somewhat below the radar, partly because they were excluded from the ICO mania. But that hasn’t stopped them from building and, in some cases, raising decent money – if more quietly than others.  Take Algorand. The proof-of-stake blockchain, built by Turing Award-winning MIT computer scientist Silvio Micali, uses a randomly selected committee system for validating blocks that saves on computing power and aspires to achieve a massive three million confirmed transactions per second serving 4 billion users – capacity that’s many, many orders of magnitude greater than both bitcoin and ethereum.  In October, the Algorand team raised $62 million from what it described as a “broad global investment group representing the venture capital, cryptocurrency and financial services communities.” This week it lined up a further $100 million commitment from venture firm Algo Capital to fund app developers working on top of the Algorand platform.  Then there’s Devvio, which is targeting mainstream corporate and enterprise users and is preparing a coming-out presentation for the Digital Money Forum at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January.  Founded in Albuquerque by robotics pioneer Tom Anderson, Devvio has filed a number of patents for a protocol that took a lot of the ideas generated elsewhere on sharding, stablecoins, identity and custody solutions. Devvio claims to have achieved a whopping 8 million transactions per second as a benchmark result in testing its platform. Note: these claims are yet to be subjected to extensive peer review and Devvio has not published results of planned security audits.  Another under-discussed permissionless blockchain is that of Nexus Earth, whose multi-layered consensus process, known as Tritium, is designed to increase throughput by giving nodes different tasks to undertake within that process rather than doing all of them.  Nexus says that a recent test by founder and chief architect Colin Cantrell achieved throughput of almost 200,000 data requests per second and transactions of more than 4,000 per second.  While Nexus' transaction processing claims are much more modest than those of Algorand and Devvio, they are well above those of bitcoin and ethereum, which handle seven and 15 transactions a second, respectively, and four times that of Ripple at 1,500 per second.  Importantly, Nexus is also tackling a secondary problem of network scaling. Via the involvement of former Cisco senior engineer Dino Farinacci, it is integrating the Locator/ID Separation Protocol, or LISP, which allows for identity interoperability across devices. This could engage Nexus in solutions aimed at bringing blockchain-based security to decentralized Internet of Things networks.  Cashed-up ICO recipients  Other, higher-profile projects are also hard at work developing large-scale blockchain solutions.  EOS, led by block.one, attracted some bad press after its launch when elections of its 21 block producers caused tension in the community, but its record-breaking ICO, which raised $4 billion, has left it with a massive war chest with which to advance the protocol and fund application development. CoinDesk’s CEX shows a relatively large network and developer pool working on EOS.  Cardano, led by early ethereum founder Charles Hoskinson, is now developing a variety of scaling solutions that draw from ideas developed elsewhere. While it is underperforming in terms of the developer activity shown on the CEX, Cardano has managed to spur a significant academic interest in its platform, in part because of an aggressive research and development fund led by the holding company, IOHK.  Beyond these specific blockchain platforms, solutions aimed at cross-asset interoperability are also pushing ahead with development, posing an alternative vision for achieving scalability across different blockchains. These include Polkadot, led by another ethereum founder, Gavin Wood.  While the collapse in crypto prices was not good news for ICO-funded projects such as Cardano, Polkadot and EOS, research by BitMEX showed that many of them remain well-capitalized because they managed their treasuries proactively following the big fundraises of last year. So long as these projects don’t fall afoul of securities regulations, which might force them to return money to investors, these funds will continue to help pay for development, both of protocols and of applications working on top of them.  It’s a fool’s game to try to predict which of these solutions will succeed and which will fail. But it seems that one or more of them are poised to deliver some real advances in scaling and usability.  Far from seeing the death of crypto, we may be entering its most exciting phase.

42402360,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd43mv,1545109220,Humans on the Blockchain: Why Crypto Is the Best Defense Against AI Overlords,"Santiago Siri is the founder of Democracy Earth Foundation, a Y Combinator-backed non-profit building digital governance technology.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  As governance becomes more and more prevalent in discussions around consensus protocols, it is clear that Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision of “one-CPU-one-vote” shaped the entire crypto industry into thinking governance centered around machines, not people.  But if artificial intelligence (AI) is indeed a threat to humanity as Elon Musk and Sam Altman frequently warn, why are we risking giving AI the political power of distributed networks?  Guaranteeing a fundamental right to privacy bent early blockchain design toward anonymity. While that approach helps fight financial corruption (political corruption is exploiting the internet in ways that can also be fought back with decentralized computation), the menace of AI is less abstract than it seems. The fact that social algorithms thrive on memes helps explain today’s political reality.  However, AI is leading us to even deeper questions and challenges. The most salient fact from contemporaneous politics is the growing shadow of doubt cast over the democratic process in the U.S.: did foreign influence win the most expensive election on the planet? Since the Peace of Westphalia in the 17th Century, nation-states have been a political construction based on the idea of non-domestic intervention.  What Mark Zuckerberg didn’t dare to say in Congress when he had to testify about Russian influence exploiting Facebook is that the internet is no longer compatible with the nation-state.  Today’s internet AI is governed with our likes, retweets, upvotes and links — tokens we don’t own. These tokens own us as they constantly survey society in benefit of the network’s owners. To remain competitive with each other, Facebook and Google have incentives to become even more Orwellian.  What made them incredibly successful was their ability to formalize humans on the web. But the steep price is the privacy of a society that no longer connects via dial-up but lives online 24/7.  The question we now face is how can we formalize humans online in a decentralized way, hence guaranteeing a voice and a vote for everyone without making them subjects of corporate propaganda?  Turing-impossible Proofs  In order to establish a frontier between ourselves and internet AI, we need a decentralized protocol for singular human identities.  Unlike Facebook, a network of this kind must not be limited to the logic of media and attention-grabbing algorithms. Instead, a human consensus should be the source of legitimacy, effectively constructing a one-human-one-node graph to unlock the full potential of blockchain governance.  Legitimate influence over cryptographic budgets can transform a social network deployed over the internet into a living democracy. But this is far from a trivial task: formalizing humans in decentralized networks requires preventing bots, Sybil attacks, bribes and a Big Brother from emerging.  Let’s begin with bots. A machine's perception threshold can be measured using Turing tests, tasks designed to tell robots and humans apart. So, a human-based consensus by definition requires Turing-impossible proofs, hard for computers but easy for brains to process. To illustrate this, the birth certificate for my daughter Roma was made using video, a simple format for a fellow human to decode, but still very hard for any machine to understand.  The proof can remain private and secret — only a hash goes on a blockchain. This string of numbers is able to certify the contents and timestamp the original proof, letting nodes get validated without the need of broadcasting all the information. We can expect Moore’s Law catching up with the Uncanny Valley, so the format of the proof should be always open up for debate.  In order to ensure an identity is singular, we need to fight Sybils (in this context: humans aiming to get control of more than one node). A reputation-based graph must be put in place giving attestation rights to those able to gather more trust from the network. At Devcon4 Sina Habib introduced the idea of building a ""trust graph"" using well-known reputation algorithms like PageRank. My own experience implementing PageRank to weight retweets on Twitter led to a virtual currency project named Whuffie Bank back in 2009; it does work.  But the stake from validating nodes should also be a bounty for those able to detect false-positives in the consensus. Network policing cannot be strictly algorithmic if we want the humans to be in charge.  The risk of reputation algorithms is that they are really centralization algorithms.  This leads to nodes that can use their excess influence to buy others or be targeted and bought. To prevent bribes and monopolies from forming, a node's ability to validate new Turing-impossible proofs should be based on a cryptographic lottery that introduces randomized voting to the consensus.  If the lottery’s entropy is based on a node’s stake, it can aim to equalize attestation chances across all nodes in the long term. As a validating node, the higher your stakes the less likely you’ll be given a chance to validate again. This creates an incentive to focus on validating family first.  Today, Tomorrow and the Future  At Democracy Earth, we are designing our consensus protocol using ERC-20 tokens with staking logic designed to validate Turing-impossible proofs. When the score for a given hash reaches the consensus threshold, a check on the claim “Are you Human?” is issued for a provided ERC-725 identity.  These open specifications allow the quick prototyping and deploying of these ideas on top of any EVM-compatible blockchain. Recent research and new protocols, such as the work by David Chaum of DigiCash on randomized voting, and AlgoRand led by zero-knowledge proof co-inventor Silvio Micalli, signal the relevance of cryptographic lotteries in keeping governance fair.  In our initial work implementing web-based digital democracies it became clear that whoever controls the registry of voters can manipulate the outcome of an election. Providing a decentralized consensus on human rights can replace this point of failure also present in traditional elections.  Why not simply use the legacy reputation of established institutions for human identities?  According to the World Bank there are 1.1 billion people in the planet lacking identity and the International Rescue Committee has identified over 65 million refugees. In Latin America, I have personally met with organizations of excluded workers that estimate 10 to 15 percent of their members lack an identity because their parents never registered them or have been abandoned during childhood.  Human consensus over the internet should be able to be deployed anywhere and provide tools able to measure the inclusive capacities of blockchain economies. If a consensus for human nodes gets widespread adoption, social applications that range from borderless democracies to encrypted peer to peer lending to Universal Basic Income can become a reality.  When John Perry Barlow wrote ""A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace"" in 1996, he ended his plead asking for a “...more humane and fair civilization of the mind.""  Here, humane is a powerful word, one being used to describe the aspirations of an age giving rise to digital governance. Decentralizing democracy matters as the nation-state keeps failing a growing global society. It is worth remembering the last words published by Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi:  ""Through the creation of an independent international forum, isolated from the influence of nationalist governments spreading hate through propaganda, ordinary people in the Arab world would be able to address the structural problems their societies face.""  The real risk of formalizing humans on the blockchain is not doing it.  Have a strong take on 2018? Email news [at] coindesk.com to submit an opinion to our 2018: Year in Review.
