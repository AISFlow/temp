42425473,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIDwRh,1393065654,New Banking Task Force to Study Digital Currencies,"The Chairman of the US Senate's Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) which investigated digital currencies in November has responded positively to the creation of a new state bankers' task force to perform its own study into what sort of regulation is necessary.  The new ""Emerging Payments Task Force"" comes from the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS), a national meeting group of regulators from all states ""dedicated to advancing the state banking system"" in the US at a federal level. It aims to study the impacts and potential consumer protection issues arising from new payment method technologies, including bitcoin, among several others.  HSGAC Chairman Senator Tom Carper (D-Del) issued a press statement earlier approving the move, saying he wanted to ensure governments ""are adequately protecting consumers and addressing lawbreakers without hindering innovation"".    ""That’s why I am encouraged that the Conference of State Bank Supervisors is paying attention to this evolving technology and looking for ways to better coordinate oversight to protect consumers and local communities.      While there is still more work to be done, this is an important step. I encourage federal and state agencies and local entities, including banks, to further their collaboration so consumers and businesses can understand the rules of the road and be well served by them.”    Digital currency stakeholders  The Task Force will speak to a ""broad range of stakeholders"" in the virtual currency and payments sphere, including state and federal regulators, people in the industry, and other experts. It too believes there must be enough regulation to protect participants but not at the expense of progress.  ""State regulators welcome a robust and focused dialogue about the benefits and risks of innovations to payment systems,"" said CSBS Chairman and Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions Commissioner Charles A. Vice. ""We seek an environment where technological innovation can be developed, but also regulated in a clear manner.""  The Task Force will include state regulators from nine states, including Superintendent of New York State Department of Financial Services Benjamin Lawsky, who oversaw that Department's recent hearings into digital currencies and who also promotes special 'BitLicence' money transmitter regulations specific to such systems.  On its website, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors introduces itself thus:  ""Our regulator membership sets us apart from other Washington organizations. Our strength lies in bringing all state banking departments together to present a unified voice in Washington. Through CSBS, state bank regulatory agencies continue to champion a system that offers competitive chartering options and efficient and effective – and local – supervision.""

42425482,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIDwlh,1393061766,Japanese Police Shut Down Protest at Mt. Gox,"The small group of protestors outside Mt. Gox in Tokyo were moved on late yesterday by Japanese police, and warned not to return without a 'demonstration license'.  Organizer Kolin Burges said the police were called not by Mt. Gox, but one of the building's other tenants who had reportedly had enough of the protestors' week-long presence at the building.  Mt. Gox management was also said to be irritated by the ongoing sit-in, claiming ""security problems"" caused by the protest and other technical issues were slowing its progress at fixing its bitcoin withdrawal problem. The company had previously posted a notice on its support page claiming to be moving location.  This effectively ends the protest in its current form, since the group is unlikely to secure the license. For the most part the protest consisted only of two people, though they had been joined at other stages during the week by curious bitcoiners and financial media reporters. One of the Japanese language signs the pair was holding invited locals to join in and gave the street address.  Growing numbers  Burges said there were around 10 people standing near the building when police arrived. He explained:  ""We went to the police station for a license and were told that for a demonstration license you need to move along a pre-planned route, with start and end points. So it looks like we cannot get a license and can't go back there.""  Anyone walking through Tokyo on any given weekend is bound to encounter a rally or two, many of which do not appear to be moving, and which can be quite rowdy. The most common demonstration themes are anti-nuclear power or North Korea, plus the infamous loudspeaker buses operated by the far-right uyoku. The Russian, Chinese and US embassies are popular rallying points, and all have a permanent riot squad presence.  Burges indicated he still wanted to continue the protest in some form, but would have to think of other tactics. A physical presence may or may not be involved, though it is generally considered unwise to tempt fate with the Japanese police after a warning.  The price of a bitcoin on Mt. Gox continues to slide, even falling below the $100 mark at one point and hovering around that amount since. Most price aggregators, including CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, have removed Mt. Gox from their averages. The average global price is a comparatively robust $564, but still much lower than the $900 or so before the current problems began to get attention.
