42405335,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeM4J5,1604091576,Crypto Lender Celsius Taps Horizen for 'Proof-of-Reserves' Proof of Concept,"Crypto lender Celsius is producing a series of experiments over the next few months that would test what it would look like for the company to decentralize some of its operations.      The centralized finance (CeFi) stalwart is working with Horizen, a platform that develops and maintains the privacy token ZEN, to take a look at creating a proof-of-reserves system using Horizen’s zero-knowledge proofs.      “The biggest challenge in CeFi is transparency,” said Nuke Goldstein, chief technology officer at Celsius. “How do we show the world that the numbers that we report are real?”      The proof-of-reserves pilot would take the information that appears on Celsius’ website and have it fed from a Horizen sidechain as opposed to Celsius’ internal servers. The application would show total customer assets per coin type at first and eventually share Celsius transaction data encrypted by Horizen’s zero-knowledge-proof toolkit so as to not reveal the personally identifiable information of customers.      That said, the proof of reserves wouldn’t give customers a look into what portion of Celsius’ lending portfolio is unsecured; what portion of depositors’ funds have been invested in derivatives contracts rather than in loans; or the amount of collateral pledged by borrowers that is being rehypothecated (i.e. lent out) by Celsius.      Read more: What Crypto Lender Celsius Isn’t Telling Its Depositors      Nic Carter, co-founder of Castle Island Ventures and Coin Metrics, has written extensively about proof of reserves and is advocating for every crypto custody firm to adopt the transparency measure.      “Because I’ve never seen a proof of reserves for a lender before, it’s difficult to conceptualize what they’re trying to do,” Carter said via email. “ZK-proofs for PoR I’m familiar with, but they are a bit black-boxy. I’ve never seen them deployed in the wild.”      Celsius failed to provide a wireframe of the concept. CTO Goldstein added:    “The full implementation will automate reserve tracking directly from blockchain feeds and retain the privacy of individual accounts so that account data cannot be reverse-engineered.”    The company is going to start offering these solutions on the retail side of its loan book first, Goldstein added.      Celsius will also subject these proofs-of-concept to hackathons in the Celsius community.      “We’re going to wrap the ideas and technology in such a way that we can share with the community and say, ‘Try to find holes in this, try to find what’s wrong with this,’” Goldstein said. “And if you find something, we pay you for it.”      It will be years however before customers see these applications in production, Goldstein said.      “It’s a long process but these phases will get us closer,” he said.

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $13,354 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 0.14% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $13,191-$13,663  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    The price of bitcoin was able to muster a rise to as high as $13,663 Friday, according to CoinDesk 20 data. However, the world’s oldest cryptocurrency subsequently lost some steam and settled to $13,354 as of press time.      Read More: Deribit Sees Record Bitcoin Options Volume as Activity in $36K Calls Surge      Michaeal Gord, chief executive officer for trading firm Global Digital Assets, said he expects the bitcoin market to cool ahead of uncertain fundamentals next week. “I think we’ll probably stay sideways until the [Nov. 3 U.S. presidential] election, with most investors taking a wait-and-see approach,” he said.      However, Gord said he anticipates things will pick up amid coronavirus concerns on the global economy.      “As more countries enter a second lockdown, governments will need to print more fiat currency to keep their economies afloat, which I expect to result in an increasing demand for alternative assets over the next few weeks,” he said.      Volumes on major USD/BTC spot exchanges are shaping up to be higher than average the past month Friday. Daily average volume has been $494,925.493 the past 30 days, while Friday was at $700,217,632 as of press time.      While higher than average volumes might indicate a potential price move upward, it’s possible equities will be taking the front seat in how bitcoin performs in the near term.      “For most of the pandemic, BTC remained correlated with equities,” noted Andrew Ballinger, an investment analyst at crypto-focused firm Wave Financial. Indeed, correlations between bitcoin and the S&P 500 seem to be rising as stock sell-offs or tepid days had an impact on the cryptocurrency market.      “I wouldn’t be fully honest if I said I didn’t believe a major downturn in equities would have no effect on the still-nascent digital asset economy,” Ballinger added. Major stocks indices are in the red on Friday.    The Nikkei 225 in Asia slipped 1.5% as coronavirus concerns outweighed the release of positive Japanese industrial output numbers for September.  The FTSE 100 in Europe ended the day flat, in the red 0.08% as investors signaled uncertainty amid lockdowns and eurozone GDP beating forecasts.  In the United States the S&P 500 fell 2.1% as increasing concerns about the pandemic combined with stalled talks in Congress on a stimulus package led investors to sell.    Despite the possibly negative influence of stocks on crypto, Ballinger has a bullish forecast. “Short of a significant and swift hit to the equity markets, I still stand by my prediction of bitcoin hitting $14,000 before year end,” Ballinger said. “With continued uncertainty surrounding the economic recovery, investors may turn to digital currencies over equities, and test the ‘digital gold’ thesis of bitcoin further.”    DeFi value locked drops    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was down Friday trading around $383 and slipping 1.9% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

On Friday, the amount of crypto TVL dipped below $11 billion. The last time TVL was at this level was back on Oct. 8.      Over-the-counter crypto trader Alessandro Andreotti said the DeFi TVL decline is only temporary because of bitcoin’s price closing in on 2020 highs. “I think it's only a momentary downtrend since bitcoin is on the spotlight for now. We're gonna see new highs for DeFi and crypto in general after the U.S. election,” he said.

42405353,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeM4Wr,1604087203,Desperation Among Filecoin Miners Creating a Big Market for FIL Borrowing,"CORRECTION (31 October 18:16 UTC): A previous version of this story incorrectly reported that Ether Capital is a holder of Filecoin tokens. Ether Capital did not invest in Filecoin and does not have any relationship to the project.      Filecoin miners are paying large investors an annual percentage rate as high as 40% to borrow FIL, the closely-held native token required to participate in the decentralized storage network.      This dynamic has created a lending market and is leading to more questions about Filecoin’s economic model.      The lack of liquidity in tokens required to mine on the proof-of-stake storage network is forcing desperate miners to borrow FIL rather than going into the open market to purchase tokens. The token’s price skyrocketed to $114 when the mainnet launched Oct. 15, settling at around $28 as of press time. However, that is still too rich for many miners who have already invested a lot of money in hardware rigs to support the network.      One of those leading the way in brokering these deals is the accredited investor portal CoinList. Matthieu Jobbe Duval, the company’s head of financial products, confirmed to CoinDesk the firm is making deals that pay an annual percentage yield of 40% over a three-month term for FIL liquidity. “Everybody's looking for filecoin for a very simple reason,” Duval said. “There are very few tokens out there because the investments in the [initial coin offering] were done with a vesting schedule.”      The Filecoin blockchain, from Protocol Labs, includes decentralized file storage (the Interplanetary File System, or IPFS) and a content distribution network. It went live on Oct. 15.      Read more: Filecoin Launch Finally Brings $200M ICO to Fruition      Every day a smart contract on the Filecoin blockchain gives investors a small amount of FIL over the course of six months. Or one year. Or three years. It depends on the vesting agreed to by investors. Duval says hundreds of Filecoin investors are participating in the CoinList lending program, some of whom invested millions of dollars in the project and therefore have a generous amount even though the tokens are still vesting.      Brian Mosoff is CEO of Canada-based investment firm Ether Capital. Recently, he told CoinDesk rates for lending FIL to miners was initially at 8% but then went up to 15%. This week, the rate skyrocketed to 40% and Mosoff decided on Thursday to lend 3,500 FIL of his personal holdings, worth $98,000 at current prices.      “I think one thing that went on here is that miners in China took out loans to buy gear without mining an appropriate amount,” Mosoff told CoinDesk. “They are screwed so they have no choice but to borrow – or buy – to mine and service the loans.”      Here’s how the loans work: Miners (or FIL market liquidity providers like trading desks, which are also participating, according to CoinList) borrow the FIL instead of buying it at expensive spot prices. The return to a lender is in the form of FIL tokens on a percentage basis, sometimes as high as 40%. The hope from the miners’ perspective is the price of FIL continues to experience sell pressure when the loan matures, according to Mosoff. “They pay back the loan in either mined FIL or open market purchase at lower price,” he said.      Filecoin miners have very specialized equipment and they require the FIL token for collateral as a trust mechanism in order to complete “deals” to provide storage for users. The more space miners provide, the more tokens they need. This development came after some Filecoin miners demanded more reward tokens as part of a readjustment of the economic model by Protocol Labs.      The Filecoin project’s IPFS is a distributed rival to Amazon’s S3 or Google Cloud storage product. However, while Amazon S3, for example, is centralized with a standard client-server model, Filecoin upends this by using miners as its storage hosts. The goal is to reduce storage costs and provide censorship resistance. In return, miners are paid in filecoin but ironically, some of the biggest potential participants are getting a raw deal since they don’t own enough FIL to stake.      On its website, Filecoin advertises that “the more storage you add, the more filecoin you’ll earn”. According to data aggregator Filfox, some top miners are currently making 10,000 FIL a day. But market dynamics are making it such that the largest of the operators just can’t get enough of it cheaply to run their businesses.      A highly touted project, Filecoin raised over $200 million in an initial coin offering back in 2017 and is backed by Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and Union Square Ventures among other investors. When asked for comment on the liquidity dynamics of FIL, a representative for Protocol Labs did not provide a statement as of press time.

42405343,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeM4Oz,1604085318,Bitcoin Developers Still Divided on Specifics of Taproot Activation,"The code for Taproot, Bitcoin’s biggest upgrade in years, is finalized and has been packaged into a forthcoming update. Only, it’s not ready to be deployed yet because Bitcoin developers have differing opinions on the best route to activation.      Taproot will enhance Bitcoin’s smart contract capabilities by implementing a new digital signature scheme, Schnorr. Implementing the upgrade requires a “soft fork” of Bitcoin’s code, and there are a few competing proposals for how to activate it.      In a bid to expedite implementation discussions, Bitcoin Core contributor A.J. Towns recently surveyed 12 other developers who have been active in the implementation process to glean their thoughts on what activation should look like.      Read more: Bitcoin’s Future: Exactly How a Coming Upgrade Could Improve Privacy and Scaling      The results of the survey show that, while developers are generally aligned when it comes to the big picture of Taproot’s activation, they disagree on the details. As they debate the finer points, the developer’s conservative, careful deliberation may seem like nitpicking to outsiders.      But it shows that so-called “soft-fork” upgrades like Taproot are not entirely riskless events – and that the specter of the controversial Segwit soft fork has haunted discussions.    Taproot activation proposals, explained    The Segwit transaction load increase was Bitcoin’s last soft fork, or an upgrade that is “backwards compatible,” meaning software running the old version of the code can still interact with the upgraded version.      Segwit’s activation was anything but smooth and relied on tweaks along the way after miners failed to adopt the upgrade in its first year. To keep the upgrade from failing, a new implementation proposal was adopted in the middle of the activation process. In an effort to put pressure on miners to upgrade, one proposal even suggested that node operators – those Bitcoin users who run Bitcoin’s software and keep a copy of its ledger – reject transactions from the miners who hadn't updated to SegWit to expedite its adoption.      Read more: Taproot Has Been Merged Into Bitcoin Core: Here’s What That Means      In a perfect world, both node users and miners would upgrade simultaneously to ensure no conflict would “split” the chain – or result in two rival factions supporting two different versions of Bitcoin’s code.      Even though Taproot is a non-controversial upgrade, the memory of Segwit is making developers cautious when evaluating this latest upgrade.    Two proposals    Two of the leading implementation proposals for Taproot rely on a mix of miner signaling and user activation. BIP 8, introduced in 2017 by Bitcoin developers Luke Dashjr and Shoalinfry, would include a signaling period for miners; if enough miners don’t activate to reach consensus on the upgrade, then a “flag day” for activation would automatically upgrade Bitcoin nodes that have downloaded v0.21 of Bitcoin Core.      These nodes would reject blocks and transactions from miners who do not support Taproot, so in theory, this method would incentivize miners to adopt the new ruleset lest they lose out on profits.      In a second Taproot implementation proposal, Core developer Matt Corallo’s Modern Softfork Activation, fuses BIP 8 with BIP 9 (the latter being the proposal originally adopted to activate Segwit but which proved inadequate).      Corallo’s hybrid model first includes a one-year signaling period for miners. Second, if a super-majority of miners does not update during this timeframe, then the upgrade would be subject to a six-month review to make changes (if any) to the proposal.      The third and final step is a BIP 8-style activation period of two years, with a non-mandatory flag-day for node users to activate the update.    What Bitcoin developers think    For the first question in his survey, AJ Towns asks developers what percentage of miners need to signal an upgrade for it to be considered a safe majority. Eight believe that nothing less than 85%-95% would be sufficient. The thinking is that anything less threatens a network “split” where some miners run the older code and some the newer code, which would create two conflicting transaction histories.      Failing a miner-signalled activation, seven respondents think a flag day for node-enforced activation could come as soon as 12-18 months after activation begins. If too few miners adopt the upgrade, this would mean nodes could enforce the Taproot ruleset and only accept blocks from miners who also signaled for the upgrade.    In a perfect world, both node users and miners would upgrade simultaneously to ensure no conflict would “split” the chain – or result in two rival factions supporting two different versions of Bitcoin’s code.    Almost all of the developers surveyed want to wait to see if miners and users adopt the upgrade on their own before deciding on a hard date for flag day (if there’s enough early support, a flag day may not be necessary at all).      If activation doesn’t come to pass through voluntary activation, then a flag day activation is the last option on the table. Most respondents were in favor of a mandatory flag day to automatically signal the update. This would mean updated nodes would reject blocks from miners who haven’t signaled for the upgrade.    Disagreements on the finer details    So-called forced signaling through the flag day would have the benefit of making Taproot default on any Bitcoin Core node running v.21; in turn, these nodes would only accept block data from miners who have also signaled the update, so in theory this would encourage miners to upgrade lest they lose their business.      But what if the miners have node users who do accept their blocks?      This is one caveat to forced signaling: If too many miners and node users don’t accept Taproot and refuse to update their software, then the network could split into two competing chains. If enough economic interest backs the “old” version of Bitcoin, then the result could be two competing assets.      This outcome is partly why some developers, like Matt Corallo, think that forced signaling is unnecessary.      Since Taproot has been largely uncontroversial, it would be a political risk to force signal the upgrade, he argues. He considers the activation method a relic of Segwit’s “user-activated soft fork,” a proposal to activate Segwit through similar means after miners failed to adopt the upgrade. Segwit was very controversial and political. Taproot is not, but Corallo believes enforced signalling threatens to make it that way.      In his post, Towns writes the mandatory signaling would be a way to definitively enforce Taproot’s network-wide activation after enough consensus has been established through discussion and miner support.      “If you want to maximize the number of nodes that will enforce the rules should a flag day occur, but also only choose the flag day after an initial activation attempt is already widely deployed, then you have no choice but to make signaling mandatory when the flag day occurs,” Towns writes.    What’s the holdup?    Towns introduces an alternative activation proposal in the survey which features a four-year activation time frame. As ever in Bitcoin development discussion, this, too, received some pushback.      “Once the decision to activate has overwhelming support from developers and users, the longer the timeframe for activation (beyond that practically required for miners to safely upgrade) the more things that can go wrong,” former Bitcoin Core developer Eric Lombrozo said to Towns on Twitter.      Risks aside, if most developers and Bitcoiners think Taproot is a shoe-in for an upgrade, it shouldn’t take four years to activate, especially since it has already been so-long in the making.      After all, if Taproot’s been in the works since 2018, shouldn’t miners and node operators know what to expect?      As Blockstream CEO Adam Back put it on Twitter, “Taproot can't be a surprise after several years.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET | FORKS,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/10/30/bitcoin-developers-still-divided-on-specifics-of-taproot-activation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8a95374e0c3fd207582ecbd940acf80f5a9177ab-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""If [voting] doesn't work as well as it should, next week think about how Voatz could have solved that,"" Overstock chief Jonathan Johnson told investors during OSTK's Oct. 29 earnings call.      Johnson, who is also president of Overstock's blockchain investments subsidiary Medici Ventures, was referring to the Medici-backed mobile voting app Voatz, which claims to use blockchain technology to secure users' vote.      Read more: Downvoted: Security Researchers Slam Voatz Over Stance on White-Hat Hackers      Elections officials in 29 of America's 3,141 counties have allowed certain absentee voters to cast ballots via Voatz in past elections, Johnson said. He noted that one county in Utah is using Voatz in next week's contest. More partners are on the way, he said.      Johnson's comments suggest that Medici sees an even wider opening for its mobile voting company in the wake of next week's election. Voting experts are anticipating a messy and lengthy vote count that could cloud the rhetorically charged presidential race with yet more uncertainty.      Whether Voatz works as well as it should is similarly uncertain.      MIT security researchers blasted the app's cybersecurity safeguards in a February 2020 paper that the company called unfair and inaccurate. Voatz said at the time it had addressed vulnerabilities identified in a separate U.S. Department of Homeland Security cyber audit.

42405357,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeM4an,1604079089,Money Reimagined: Who Are the Real Monsters?,"For this special Halloween edition, CoinDesk Executive Editor Marc Hochstein weighs in with a guest column about the spookier aspects of the banking system.      It’s a perfect follow-up to last week’s newsletter on the harmful legacy of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act.      Before you dig into it, let me remind you to check out this week’s Money Reimagined podcast.      In this episode, Sheila Warren and I interview the newly reelected premier of Bermuda, David Burt, who is spearheading projects to use the island as a testing ground for stablecoins and to launch a communally-owned national digital bank.      –Michael J. Casey    Ghouls, Goblins and Shibboleths    With Halloween and the 12th anniversary of the Bitcoin white paper approaching, it’s an apt moment to consider a classic horror trope through a monetary lens.      “Who are the real monsters?”      From Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein” to George Romero’s “Night of the Living Dead,” to Jordan Peele’s “Us,” some of the scariest tales suggest that “normal” people are more nefarious than the nominal bogeymen. This is a useful way to think about the allegedly abominable qualities of cryptocurrency when compared to the incumbent institutions it challenges – and the supposedly safer visions they are now putting forth.      Since CoinDesk is a family publication, I won’t go into the details of those gory fictional works. Besides, because there’s an element of farce here as well, I’ve got an even better seasonally appropriate metaphor: “The Munsters.”      For the 99% of readers too young to remember, this was a 1960s sitcom about an eccentric family who live in a cobwebbed mansion and resemble iconic movie monsters. The patriarch, Herman Munster, is a dead ringer (ahem) for Frankenstein’s monster, his wife and father-in-law are vampires, his son a werewolf. They’re a friendly bunch but never quite understand why the neighbors act so strangely around them.      The most important character for this discussion is Marilyn, Herman’s teenage niece. She isn’t a monster at all; she’s the archetypal Girl Next Door. The running gag is that the other Munsters pity Marilyn for her looks, and even she somehow blames herself when boyfriends run away screaming upon meeting her relatives.      Just like Marilyn Munster, the Bitcoin network is a wholesome outlier among the frightening creatures of the legacy financial system.    The censorship monster    The cryotocurrency’s chief value proposition, censorship resistance, is not a radical departure from tradition as sometimes implied. On the contrary, it’s the way money’s been since the days of cowrie shells. All Bitcoin did was restore it for transactions over the internet.      You go to a butcher shop, you hand a few banknotes to the guy behind the counter, he gives you a steak. No third party who thinks you should be eating soy instead can veto the transaction. That’s normal.      What’s abnormal is busybody A pressuring intermediary B to prevent individuals C and D from transacting, even lawfully. Even more abnormal is moving to a world where every last C and D has no choice but to rely on a B and therefore lives at the mercy of the As.      None of this is to say that intermediaries are going away, nor that they should. They can add value. The problem is having no choice but to use one, which makes them choke points to be exploited by scolds and tyrants.      Possessed, like Linda Blair in “The Exorcist,” you might say.    The asset seizure monster    Another characteristic bitcoin (loyalists to other crypto tribes may substitute the asset of their choice) shares with older forms of money, and not the electronic kind that sits in your bank account, is that it is a bearer asset. Like cash, once you lose it, it’s gone, and it’s the holder’s burden to keep it secure through careful storage of their cryptographic private keys.      Yes, this is scary, as many crypto investors can attest. But also scary is cops seizing assets of people who haven’t been charged with a crime and putting the burden on them to prove an asset wasn’t involved in a crime. What’s even more terrifying is moving to a world where ALL money is held at intermediaries who must comply with such a regime.      In this context, the advantage of a bearer asset secured with public-key cryptography is that the authorities cannot unilaterally seize someone’s funds by subpoenaing a bank. They need the key holder to cooperate, even if under duress. As I’ve written before, this “claws back a modicum of power for the individual” from the lurking Leviathan.    The surveillance monster    One more commonality with cash is that bitcoin requires no personally identifiable information to handle – at least, the basic open-source software doesn’t, even if regulated exchanges demand it.      The pseudonymity of alphanumeric addresses, along with the aforementioned resistance to seizure and censorship, go a long way toward explaining the technology’s popularity among criminals and other unsavory types.      “Current terrorist use of cryptocurrency may represent the first raindrops of an oncoming storm of expanded use,” warned a recent report by a U.S. Department of Justice task force. The laundering of illicit funds, the report pointed out, “can be substantially easier when the movement of funds takes place online and anonymously.” That’s enough to give anyone goosebumps.      But remember that the demand for legibility of financial flows is a modern phenomenon. The U.S. Bank Secrecy Act only just turned 50 (with mixed results at best, as Michael J. Casey wrote last week). Depending on how you define it, money has been around for as long as 5,000 years.      Legibility is the aberration. Legibility is an ongoing experiment.      That experiment has spawned its own terrors. Consumers in today’s digital world must entrust sensitive personal data to an untold number of hackable organizations, Equifaxes-in-waiting.      Even more chillingly, the powers-that-be want to double down. U.S. regulators recently proposed lowering the threshold for the “travel rule” to $250 from $3,000 for international money transfers. Under the travel rule, if you wire someone money, not only does your bank know your name, account number and address, so must the recipient’s bank, and it keeps a record for five years. And if you receive money, there’s a chance the sender’s bank has your name and address as well. Perhaps this makes sense for high-roller transactions, but $250?    The inflation monster    Also, note that $3,000 in 1996, the year the travel rule was created, is equivalent to nearly $5,000 in today’s dollars.      So even if the regulators don’t follow through on their proposal to lower the threshold for international wires, it’s already been happening in slow motion, thanks to inflation. Every year the dragnet widens a bit automatically, just as it has for the cash transaction reports banks file to the government.      The upshot is that, by default, more and more personal information is likely to be captured over time.      And that brings us to the last way bitcoin is a return to form rather than a deviation, although this one is perhaps the most controversial.      While its exchange rate with the dollar fluctuates wildly from minute to minute, over time bitcoin has appreciated mightily in value. To detractors, the short-term volatility makes it useless as a currency; to proponents, the long-term appreciation and hard supply cap make it the ideal currency, one that incentivizes saving.      They have a point. “A penny saved is a penny earned.” That’s normal. Or was – it’s the kind of thing you hear parents say in black-and-white sitcoms.      “Stop whining about low interest rates, hoarder. It’s your patriotic duty to blow your discretionary income at the mall or wager it on stonks, we need to keep the economy moving.” That’s the stuff of nightmares.      – Marc Hochstein    Betting the company on bitcoin    As the price of bitcoin has surged higher in recent months, a string of listed companies has announced they are engaging with the cryptocurrency. On Aug. 11, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy bought a whopping $250 million worth of bitcoin before adding another $175 million on Sept. 15. Three weeks later, payments company Square put $50 million into the cryptocurrency. Then, on Wednesday last week, U.K.-listed fintech firm Mode Global Holdings revealed a “significant purchase” of bitcoin for treasury management purposes and PayPal confirmed it would enable bitcoin transactions on its payments app.      In the first three cases, the companies essentially embraced the thinking of many bitcoin bulls, treating the cryptocurrency as a “digital gold” hedge with which to protect their liquid assets against future monetary stress. With PayPal, the action was likely more geared toward leveraging an anticipated rise in public demand for bitcoin. For all four, the announcements boosted the companies’ stock prices.      There have essentially been two reactions to these moves.      One camp saw them as smart, proactive steps to front-run a trend toward wider mainstream acceptance. That view holds that at least some amount of bitcoin belongs in everyone’s investment portfolio because it functions as a valuable, uncorrelated asset and that this is now of greater relevance as uncertainty grows around the future of the global financial system. The other camp saw it as a rather cheap, even cynical move to piggyback on bitcoin’s current rising price to boost the firm’s stock price. As of late Thursday, New York time, bitcoin was up 21% from the end of July and up 17% from two weeks earlier.      A chicken-and-egg problem complicates the assessment of these two perspectives. These high-profile announcements were not neutral; they directly contributed to bitcoin’s price gains and elevated the conversation around its relevance in hedging strategies. In turn, that boosted these companies’ valuations – especially of MicroStrategy, whose bet was so large that the rising price in BTC materially increased its book value.      But bitcoin is, of course, just one of a number of factors that will affect these companies’ share price, and a small one at that. So with that in mind, let’s look at their price charts as of Thursday to see how their shares performed around those announcements.    The global town hall    PANDEMIPRENEURS. Necessity is the mother of invention, or so the saying goes. There’s been an extraordinary large number of new U.S. companies created this past year, according to Bloomberg columnist Justin Fox. Some 3.5 million new business applications were registered by the Internal Revenue Service in the first 42 weeks of the year, up from 2.9 million for the same period last year, an impressive number given the doom and gloom around COVID-19.      Fox points out that this often happens during a recession, as individuals who can’t find jobs strike out on their own. But this time the trend has been reinforced by factors unique to this social and economic phenomenon. For one, credit has been easier to come by than, say, during the Great Recession of 2009, which stemmed directly from a debt crisis. In part, that’s thanks to the small business loans rolled out in the COVID-19 stimulus package, and in part due to rising home prices as city dwellers fled to safer work-from-home environments.      Yet, the trend may also reflect the inventiveness unleashed by the crisis. The unusual circumstances, whether it’s the challenges posed by the WFH scenario or surging hospital demands for protective equipment and respirators, entrepreneurs have confronted an array of problems to solve.      The cryptocurrency community has been a part of this. Witness the surge in DeFi innovation – not exactly saving nurses’ lives but seizing on the opportunity posed by the COVID-related debt problems that loom for centralized finance (CeFi) – or the frenetic efforts of blockchain engineers and cryptographers to build privacy-preserving contact-tracing solutions. As an industry with open-source development at its core, the sector is also something of an enabler of this trend. It fosters an environment of cross-border collaborative invention, which speeds up the entrepreneurial process.      We don’t know where all these ideas will go, but something good will surely emerge from them. Maybe one day we’ll view these dark days more favorably than we do currently.

One way to read Iran’s embrace of bitcoin to avoid U.S. sanctions is to see it as an advertisement for the cryptocurrency’s core value proposition as a censorship-resistant means of payment requires no third-party intermediation – such as a U.S.-regulated bank. The other way is to see all of that as a reminder of why bitcoin will continue to make U.S. regulators exceedingly uncomfortable. Read Daniel Palmer’s update.

A soft target of January is now in the works, following the planned launch of the Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain in December.      Berlin is a hard fork of the current Eth 1.x proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain.

Berlin was scheduled to have three EIPs as of June:    EIP-2315: Simple Subroutines for the EVM  EIP-2929: Gas cost increases for state access opcodes  EIP-2537: BLS12–381 curve operations    However, EIP-2537 will no longer be included in Berlin. That EIP would make it easier for the Eth 2.0 blockchain and Eth 1.x blockchain to speak with each other by using a similar cryptographic setup.

Other important EIPs such as EIP-1559, which restructures Ethereum’s transaction model, will not be included in Berlin.

42405351,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeM4Xq,1604076818,"Blockchain Bites: Ripple's MoneyGram Pump, OKEx's Bitcoin Cash Plan, Bitcoin's Birthday","Ripple has invested over $50 million in remittance firm MoneyGram over the course of the firms’ working relationship. Forbes published an investigation detailing the byzantine corporate structure Binance may have created to avoid U.S. regulations. Ether grew as a share of Genesis Capital’s total loan book.    Top shelf    No offenses Investors who say they lost around £100,000 ($130,000) in an alleged cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme will not see remuneration after bringing their claims to the police. According to an investigation by the Metro newspaper published Tuesday, a number of investors said they had invested in a cryptocurrency project called Lyfcoin on promises of hefty returns, but had not received their money back. West Midlands Police dropped the case, however, saying none of the evidence provided took the case “further forward” and, the Metro said, “no offenses had been committed.”      Funding remittance firm MoneyGram has received over $52 million for providing “market development fees” for blockchain payments firm Ripple, since the firms struck a working relationship. In Q3 2020, Ripple invested over $9.3 million in the remittance firm, following a $15.1 million injection made the previous quarter, according to Moneygram’s latest financial report. MoneyGram has described the market development fees as compensation for providing liquidity to Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) network – its payments product using the XRP cryptocurrency to send money across borders.      Byzantine Binance Binance Holdings Limited created a corporate plan for profiting from the U.S. market while avoiding the country’s regulatory scrutiny, Forbes reported Thursday, citing a 2018 document it obtained. The leaked presentation outlines a web of U.S.-compliant entities that would funnel revenue to Binance, which is currently unregulated to operate in the U.S. The Forbes article included a screenshot of a slide but not the entire deck. Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao disputes the reporting, claiming the draft came from an affiliated third party. U.S. affiliate Binance.US operates under a corporate structure similar to the proposed network, according to Forbes. Binance.US CEO Catherine Cooley has long refused to discuss Binance.US's ownership.      Huawei's DC/EP hardwar China’s digital yuan looks closer than ever to launch with the news that Huawei will be supporting the central bank digital currency (CBDC) on an upcoming range of phones. Announced on Huawei's Weibo channel Friday, the Mate 40 line of devices will feature a built-in hardware wallet with ""hardware-level security, controllable anonymous protection, and dual offline transactions,"" the tech giant said. In recent weeks, a public trial in the city of Shenzhen saw 10 million digital yuan given away to residents in a kind of lottery. The Mate 40 was announced in October and will be the latest flagship from Huawei, along with the Pro and Pro Plus models, according to TechRadar.      Ether shares Genesis Capital saw the share of bitcoin in its loan portfolio drop as the share of ether loans increased to 12.4% of its total loan book this quarter. According to the lender’s report, this was mainly due to liquidity mining on DeFi protocols such as Compound, Aave and Uniswap. DeFi interest rate arbitrage drove Genesis – which is wholly owned by CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group – clients to borrow ETH and stablecoins to “lever up liquidity mining strategies,” the company wrote. Total trading volume in the third quarter was $4.5 billion, down from $5.25 billion in the second quarter but up by 285% from the third quarter last year.    Quick bites    “That most people still hate bitcoin isn’t a bad thing,” writes Dylan Grice of Calderwood Capital. The Economist gives an introduction to bitcoin by comparing it to a posh London club known primarily for turning away Mick Jagger at the door.      Citing high gas fees and slow blocktimes, Audius said it will migrate part of its system to Solana’s blockchain from an Ethereum sidechain. Staking and governance functionality will remain on Ethereum. (CoinDesk)      A margin change in FTX’s TRUMP future’s contract indicates traders are factoring in President Donald Trump’s diminishing chances of reelection come Nov. 3. (CoinDesk)      OKEx, still paralyzed by founder’s arrest, details plans for a bitcoin cash hard fork. (CoinDesk)    Market intel    Hashrate & fees The average price of a transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain is now 0.00086764 BTC (~$11.66), the highest since June 2018. This represents a 573% increase over the past 12 days. The spike in fees comes amid a rally to yearly highs to $13,800, and as the networks number of unconfirmed transactions ticked up 1,800% reaching highs not seen since December 2018. “In other words, the mining power dedicated to approving transactions and mining blocks has gone down amid the price rally, boosting waiting times and network congestion,” CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports.    At stake    Happy birthday, Bitcoin Tomorrow marks the 12th anniversary of Bitcoin’s white paper.      Published by pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto to a small cadre of cryptographers, the eight-page conceptual proof for a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer electronic cash system has since sparked a monetary revolution.      In the intervening years, Bitcoin has been called many things: a scam, a Ponzi scheme, dead on arrival, a joke, a tool for criminals, rat poisoned squared, a currency for geeks – and did we mention dead?      While pundits are wont to predict Bitcoin’s death, the simple ledger has remained and has even breathed new life into how societies think about money, financial access and the nebulous concept of “trust.”      Heads are turning. Yesterday, The Economist published an ode to Bitcoin saying, “Even people who are hostile to Bitcoin will concede that its technology is fiendishly clever. It is essentially a way of accounting for who has spent what. Instead of a central exchange to keep score, and to verify payments and receipts, it uses an electronic ledger that is distributed across the entire system of bitcoin users.”      Wishing Bitcoin a happy birthday, cybersecurity firm Halborn produced a video with a number of celebrities wishing it well. (It's a bit bizarro, but well-meaning.)      In a cameo appearance, Wu-Tang Clan's RZA said, “Ya know Bitcoin was created by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto doin his thang. I wanna say one thing about this – If you don’t know about it, you better know about it, because yo… at the end of the day scientists can create something, son, but the value on everything is what we put on it.

The biggest cryptocurrency exchange by options volume has traded a record 47,000 bitcoin options contract in the past 24 hours with a notional value of more than $500 million. Also, the exchange registered the largest single trade of 8,000 contracts.  Call options expiring in January 2021 at strikes of $36,000 and $32,000 have contributed more than 40% of the total trading volume.  According to data source Skew, the $36,000 call option has seen 16,078 contracts change hands today, while the $32,000 call has registered a volume of 4,000 contracts.  ""The originator(s) of these trades expects BTC to trade above the strike levels [$36,000] by the end of January 2020 and is willing to back this expectation with significant volume,"" Luuk Strijers, CCO of Deribit, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  However, the idea of bitcoin rising to levels above $32,000/$36,000 by the end of January appears somewhat farfetched, given the options market is currently assigning only a 14% probability of prices challenging record highs by the end of the first quarter.  It could be a volatility play. Trader(s) who bought call options at $36,000 and $32,000 may be anticipating a pickup in volatility before the January expiry. Volatility has a positive impact on option prices.  So far Friday, the highest volume has been seen in $36,000 calls expiring in January.  A call option gives the investor the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. Meanwhile, a put option represents a right to sell.

""With the U.S. election just days away, we are going to have to be patient when it comes to headwinds lifting BTC to new multi-year highs,"" Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the cryptocurrency-focused financial firm Diginex, wrote in a note to clients.      In traditional markets, European stocks fluctuated and U.S. futures pointed to a lower open. The dollar was steady in foreign exchange markets and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields rose 0.01 percentage point to 0.83%.      “Our short-term risk appetite indicator is firmly in negative territory,” said Jean-Francois Paren, head of global markets research at Credit Agricole CIB, in a note to clients, according to Bloomberg News.    Market moves    There's an undercurrent in the crypto industry where true believers like to paint the future of money as less about, well, money than about truth and exposing the flaws and failings and abuses and wrongs of the traditional financial system and economy.      It's not just about getting rich. It's about reimagining the entire system, starting from scratch with state-of-the-art technology and fresh ideas, a complete reset.      It's also about convincing everyone else that the mission is worthy, perhaps inevitable – on the right side of history.      Such is the backdrop for the latest monthly letter from Dan Morehead, a former Goldman Sachs derivatives trader and hedge-fund manger who now runs the cryptocurrency investment firm Pantera Capital in San Francisco.      The missive includes a clever table intended to demonstrate just how succinct, concise, laconic, crisp, efficient and compact Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto was when he penned the white paper that served as the intellectual, logical, economic and mathematical foundation for the original and still-largest blockchain-cum-cryptocurrency.      Nakamoto needed just 3,192 words for the blueprint, or less than a tenth of the book of Genesis from the Jewish and Christian Bible. The number is half as many as it took to pen the U.S. Constitution and about 1% of Adam Smith's seminal ""Wealth of Nations.""      ""Blockchain for Dummies,"" a simplified instructional book on blockchain, needed 20 times as many words to explain the technology as Nakamoto's white paper.      But aside from pointing out the elegant genius of bitcoin's (possibly?) pseudonymous founder, the essential crypto viewpoint is one of trying to look at the world in just the right way. According to Morehead, the following chart offers a key reminder that as global economies bounce back from the coronavirus-triggered lockdowns earlier this year, the loss of output remains severe:      The point was to illustrate the lack of context for Thursday's U.S. government report that the world's largest economy surged 33% in the third quarter, as the lockdowns eased. To put it in market terms, it was perhaps the biggest dead-cat bounce in world history, measured in dollar terms.      With the economy in shambles, the thinking goes, massive stimulus will be needed from the government and Federal Reserve, eventually debasing the dollar and pushing up prices for bitcoin. (Deribit, the biggest cryptocurrency options exchange, just listed a contract that allows traders to bet on a price rally to $40,000 next year, triple the current price.)      Morehead wrote in the letter that a recent rush into bitcoin by big players like PayPal, MicroStrategy and Paul Tudor Jones might ultimately give more big players cover to follow.      This isn't about greed, or the future of money. It's about right and wrong, or rather who's right, and who's wrong.      ""A movement doesn’t succeed because of its initial leader,"" Morehead wrote. ""Rather, it’s the first follower and the subsequent followers who make it work. The more who join in, the less risky it is to take part in it. Those who were on the fence before, have fewer excuses as the movement grows.""      For anyone wondering, Pantera's full monthly newsletter clocked in at about 3,130 words. For what it's worth.    Bitcoin watch    While the market environment is currently not conducive for bullish price action in bitcoin, the cryptocurrency is unlikely to see a meteoric fall, according to analysts.      ""Given the upcoming U.S. elections and meltdown in the legacy markets, traditional investors will maintain a risk-off mindset,"" trader and analyst Nick Cote told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.      Some observers say the U.S. could face a constitutional crisis if Democratic candidate Joe Biden wins by a thin margin and President Donald Trump tries to cast doubt on the results. The election uncertainty, coupled with coronavirus resurgence in the U.S. and across Europe, has triggered risk aversion in stock markets this week and applied brakes to bitcoin's price rally.      The anti-risk mood could prevail at least till the U.S. election on Nov. 3. As such, Patrick Heusser, senior cryptocurrency trader at Crypto Broker AG, is calling for caution on the part of short-term speculators. ""I am expecting an increase in volatility and would be careful with setting stop losses too tight,"" Heusser said. ""Traders should maintain a low risk profile right now.""      Bitcoin is currently trading in the red near $13,300, representing a 1% drop on the day. Should the risk aversion in traditional markets worsen, the cryptocurrency may revisit support at $12,500-$12,000.      ""If prices were unable to hold the bullish throwback [bull market pullback] to $12,200-$12,000, the focus would shift to next major support levels at $11,100 and $10,800,"" Cote said.      That said, a price crash looks unlikely, as major central banks are already printing massive amounts of fiat money, and the cryptocurrency is currently backed by a strong bullish narrative of increased institutional participation.      Besides, if there are widespread lockdowns and renewed economic slowdowns, central banks are expected to step in with additional stimulus, fueling inflation fears and boosting demand for bitcoin, according to Cote.      All things considered, dips in bitcoin could be short-lived.      On the higher side, the June 2019 high of $13,880 is the immediate resistance, followed by the next daily resistance block at $15,800-$16,000. There are large offers near $14,000 on cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, according to Heusser.      - Omkar Godbole    Token watch    Bitcoin (BTC): Cryptocurrency's price rally spurs increase in transactions just as end of China's rainy season prompts bitcoin miners to pare back, creating congestion and pushing up transaction fees to the highest in 28 months.

The firm, owned by CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group, saw the share of bitcoin in its loan portfolio drop as a percentage of total loans. The share of ether loans increased by five percentage points to 12.4% of the loan book quarter-over-quarter. (To be clear, loans across asset classes increased quarter-over-quarter but ETH loans now take up a larger slice of the pie.)      According to the lender’s report, this was mainly due to liquidity mining on DeFi protocols such as Compound, Aave and Uniswap. DeFi interest rate arbitrage drove Genesis clients to borrow ETH and stablecoins to “lever up liquidity mining strategies,” the company wrote.      “We haven’t seen it to this degree,” CEO Michael Moro said of previous quarters’ ETH-to-BTC ratio. “As a percentage, BTC loans just didn’t grow fast enough to keep up with the other coins.”      The clients who are lending their assets out through Genesis are high-net-worth individuals, hedge funds, family offices and other asset managers, and they generate returns of 5% to 13% on those loans, Moro said.      Firms that borrow from Genesis are hedge funds, quantitative trading firms, crypto exchanges, other crypto lenders and crypto operating companies such as bitcoin ATM firms.      Active loan originations at the firm increased by 50% to $2.1 billion in the third quarter, which was less than the 118% quarter-over-quarter increase that Genesis saw at the end of the second quarter because the second quarter increase had come after the March ""Black Thursday"" crash. The lender also saw a record $5.2 billion loan originations in the latest quarter, more than doubling the $2.2 billion for loan originations in the second quarter.      Read more: Genesis’ Crypto Lending Rebounds in 2Q; Firm Acknowledges Unsecured Loans      The firm is also soon launching an institutional lending API for exchanges and other firms that want to offer yield on crypto deposits to their retail customers. The first exchange to use the service will be DCG-owned Luno, and there are five or six other exchanges in the pipeline, Moro said.      Total trading volume in the third quarter was $4.5 billion, down from $5.25 billion in the second quarter but up by 285% from the third quarter last year. Around 90% of spot trading transactions and 30% of spot trading volumes happen through Genesis Prime’s smart-order routing engine, Moro said.      Read more: Genesis Trading Buys Crypto Custodian Vo1t in Bid to Become Prime Broker      The firm is also aiming to offer agency trading or aggregated access to exchanges with passthrough execution, from about a dozen exchanges.      Genesis also saw $1 billion in derivatives trading total volume, which was up from $400 million in the second quarter.      In the near future, Genesis also plans to offer capital introduction for family offices seeking crypto hedge funds that have the strategies, fee structure and asset exposure to fit their investing needs.

TRUMP contracts expire at $1 if Donald Trump wins the election and at $0 should he lose.

42433005,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2dBh,1604050226,UK Police Find no Crime in Alleged $3M Crypto 'Staking' Scam,"Investors who say they lost hundreds of thousands of British pounds in an alleged cryptocurrency fraud have had no luck persuading the police that there was, in fact, a crime committed.      According to an investigation by the Metro newspaper published Tuesday, a number of investors said they had invested in a cryptocurrency project called Lyfcoin on promises of hefty returns, but had not received their money back.      According to the allegations, investors were told to make staking commitments for five months to receive a 100% return, but as the period was ending they were told they'd have to extend to 12 or 24 months. Staking is a way of supporting some blockchain networks and earning rewards by committing funds for a period of time.      While it's not alleged by the newspaper that Lyfcoin itself is a fraudulent scheme – though investors likened it to the multi-billion dollar OneCoin scam – investors who spoke to Metro.co.uk said they had been encouraged to invest by individuals claiming to be involved with the project.      The group says it lost around £100,000 (US$130,000) in investing in the coin and estimates that up to £2.5 million ($3 million) could have been lost in the U.K. in total.      They claim an individual named Sakhi Rezaie recruited people for the alleged pyramid scheme, showing presentations, holding Zoom seminars and inviting potential investors to his Birmingham office. Payments to stake the token were sent to Rezaie's bank accounts and not to an official Lyfcoin account, they said.      Rezaie has claimed he was merely an investor in the crypto project, Metro said. However, the newspaper was shown WhatsApp chats and proof of payments to his account in the name of M.K. Brothers Ltd by an investor who lost £36,500 to the scheme.      The investors further allege there were several ""ringleaders"" in the U.K.      After payments were made, Rezaie ""ignored"" queries from investors about selling their stakes, they claim.      Also read: OneCoin Investors Allege BNY Mellon Aided $4B Fraud      The lyfcoin token had been touted as having a value of $1.60, but investors say they later found that it is not traded on most exchanges and in effect had a value of ""zero."" They were not provided with a wallet or tokens, they said.      One investor made a report to U.K. reporting organization Action Fraud, which Metro said passed it on to the West Midlands Police. This spring, he signed a contract – seen by the Metro – with Rezaie promising to drop the case and apologize on social media in return for monthly payments of roughly £5,000 ($6,470). He claims to have received only one payment.      The investor said he managed to claw back £18,500 of the £36,000 he put in after warning members of a Lyfcoin WhatsApp group about the alleged fraud.      West Midlands Police dropped the case, however, saying none of the evidence provided took the case ""further forward"" and in a later statement to the Metro said ""no offenses had been committed.""
