42415743,WkWFu5l5TZXnF1B32UXJt3,1631656097,Bitwise Joins Hunt for Bitcoin ETF Approval With Futures Product Filing,"ETF Series Solutions has filed to launch a bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) in partnership with Bitwise, a provider of crypto-based funds.  The application for the Bitwise Bitcoin Strategy ETF was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The fund seeks to invest in bitcoin futures and other financial products.  Proponents of bitcoin ETFs claim they would offer retail investors a regulated financial product that has exposure to bitcoin, giving those investors an alternative to investing in bitcoin directly. The SEC, the federal agency tasked with overseeing such products, has yet to approve one.  “The Fund will not invest directly in bitcoin,” the filing said. “While the Fund intends to obtain exposure to bitcoin primarily through indirect investments in standardized, cash-settled bitcoin futures contracts traded on commodity exchanges registered with the CFTC (’Bitcoin Futures’), it may also invest in pooled investment vehicles and Canadian-listed funds that provide exposure to bitcoin.” The CFTC is the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, another federal agency that regulates financial products.  Read more: Gensler’s Preference for Bitcoin Futures Products Is Likely Bad News for a Spot BTC ETF  The ETF might also invest in cash, U.S. government securities or money market funds, according to the filing. U.S. Bancorp Fund Services will act as the transfer agent and administrator, while U.S. Bank will serve as the custodian.  SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has indicated that the agency is more likely to approve a bitcoin futures ETF than a spot bitcoin ETF. A futures ETF will invest in a regulated bitcoin futures product offered by CME, rather than in bitcoin directly.  Gensler has raised concerns about crypto spot market regulation, echoing a view SEC staff has often hinted at in rejecting previous bitcoin ETF applications.  Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley declined to comment on the fund, but said, “Bitwise has been managing crypto index funds since 2017.

42376180,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwHI1n,1631653696,Solana Validators Plan Network ‘Restart’ as Outage Continues,"Solana node operators are coordinating a “restart” of the high-speed blockchain Tuesday in an attempt to bring the stuttering network back online.  “The validator community elected to coordinate a restart of the network” and is preparing a “new release” that will right the frozen blockchain, according to an afternoon tweet from the Solana Foundation.  In Solana’s Discord server, developers distributed restart instructions at 3:21 p.m. Eastern time.  The outage began early Tuesday after “resource exhaustion” on the network brought blockchain validation to an hours-long halt. On-chain activity froze across Solana’s multibillion-dollar ecosystem of trading, staking and lending projects.  A source familiar with the matter told CoinDesk that the outage “impacts everything built on Solana, but the issue is the underlying [layer 1].”  Tuesday’s outage came amid booming interest in Solana, a network seeking to attract Wall Street usage whose token has been on fire since late August. Investors have flocked to Solana as a low-fee platform for decentralized finance (DeFi).  The disruption was caused by bot trading of Grape Protocol’s Tuesday token offering, founder Anatoly Yakovenko said on Twitter. It is the second time in two weeks that Solana’s mainnet cluster experienced “instability,” according to a Messari research note reviewed by CoinDesk.  A flood of transactions pushed the network past its limits early Tuesday, Solana’s status account tweeted shortly after 3 p.m. Eastern time. The activity triggered a forking that knocked multiple nodes offline. Engineers tried and failed to triage the problem, according to Solana.  It’s not unheard of for blockchain networks to experience service disruptions. Solana’s mainnet is still in beta mode; it last experienced an outage in December, another source said. Last week’s hiccup was also related to a resource exhaustion event.  “It’s good for people to understand that Solana mainnet is still clearly in beta,” said a source building one of Solana’s popular DeFi protocols interrupted by the outage. “I have faith in the Solana core contributors and validators to resolve this issue promptly.”  Engineers were rushing to push a patch to Solana node runners, multiple sources told CoinDesk. Once it’s ready and running across 66% of validators (a supermajority on the network) Solana is expected to come back online.  Until then, the ecosystem with over $11 billion in total value locked (TVL) is in wait-and-see mode. Activity remains frozen at block #96538485.  It is unclear what implications the Tuesday outage may have for Solana. One source in the developer community pointed out that some projects have time-sensitive operations, like liquidations and IDO launches. Those could become thorny the longer the network remains down.  UPDATE (Sept. 14, 19:48 UTC): Adds information on developer response to Solana outage and background material.

42376181,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwHI33,1631653632,SEC Chair Gensler: Coinbase Should Register With Regulator,"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler warned that crypto exchanges like Coinbase should register with the regulator, an escalation of his previous statements regarding whether crypto trading platforms qualify as securities exchanges.  Gensler told the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday that the SEC, like other federal regulatory agencies, does not have direct oversight over crypto exchanges, in response to a hypothetical scenario from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) about selling cryptocurrencies during last week’s exchange outages.  “They haven’t yet registered with us, even though they have dozens of tokens that may be securities,” Gensler said.  That is the most explicit Gensler has been about having crypto trading platforms register as a securities trading platform. In prepared remarks for the committee published Monday, he wrote that any exchange that has a security listed must register with the SEC.  At the time, he did not name any specific companies. Warren used Coinbase as an example during a question about whether crypto actually bolsters financial inclusion.  “Let’s say that last Monday, I took out the last sliver of my savings, I went on the crypto exchange Coinbase, I bought $100 worth of ether, and then I woke up early on Tuesday morning, I saw that the market looked like it was beginning to tank and I thought I better sell right now, but when I tried to sell Coinbase, the exchange was down,” she said.  Gensler broadened his pitch for greater regulatory oversight of the crypto markets by asking for more resources to regulate different projects.  Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) asked if the SEC was sufficiently equipped to regulate crypto. Gensler said Congress can help coordinate oversight among banking regulators, as well as stablecoin supervision.  “I think funding wise we could use a lot more people. I just have to be frank with you, I mean there’s 6,000 projects. And while some of those are commodities, many of them are securities under the law,” he said.  Read more: Coinbase Goes Public In Its Fight With the SEC  A call for clarity  Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), one of the senators who pushed for an amendment to the Senate’s bipartisan infrastructure bill to narrow the definition of a “crypto broker” in a tax provision, pushed Gensler on a lack of explicit guidance on how a cryptocurrency might qualify as a security under federal law.  “A really important question is whether a cryptocurrency is a security for regulatory purposes under the Howey or some other tests. Based on your public statements, it’s pretty clear that you believe that some are securities, but others are not. So I’m frustrated by the lack of helpful SEC public guidance, explaining how you make this distinction. What makes some of them securities, while others are not securities,” Toomey asked in his opening remarks.  For his part, Gensler said in his remarks that “a small number” of cryptocurrencies are not securities, but he believes many are.  Toomey brought the issue up again during the back-and-forth segment of the hearing, asking about stablecoins as one example.  While Gensler pointed to different features of judicial precedent, including the Supreme Court’s “Reves” case, Toomey reiterated that his key point is a lack of explicit guidance from the SEC.  “I’m just saying as a layman who can read English, when I read those tests, stablecoins don’t seem to meet that test to me,” he said. “Maybe I’m wrong, but if I can misinterpret this, I think others could too and clarity, public clarity could be helpful.”",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/14/sec-chair-gensler-coinbase-should-register-with-regulator,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bae2fb9cdd7db8223b7be71d40ec8d0cea98ed1a-3816x2500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376183,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwHI6p,1631653549,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Returns to Above $46K Even as Indicator Shows Crypto Fear,"Cryptocurrencies were mostly higher Tuesday as U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler broadened his pitch for greater regulatory oversight of crypto markets. Bitcoin displayed little reaction to Gensler’s testimony to the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, and was up about 5% over the past 24 hours.  Gensler also warned that crypto exchanges like Coinbase should register with the SEC. “They haven’t yet registered with us, even though they have dozens of tokens that may be securities,” Gensler said.  As the SEC pushes Congress for more resources to regulate different crypto projects, large institutional investors are taking note.  “The institutionalization of digital assets means that cryptocurrencies will become more ingrained within the U.S. financial landscape,” Fitch Ratings wrote in a Tuesday report.  “The degree of clarity of regulatory guidance and oversight for digital assets is an important consideration when assessing credit implications for banks entering the space,” Fitch wrote.  Traditional banks are indirectly involved in the crypto industry by providing deposit and lending products to digital asset market participants, which could raise several compliance risks, according to Fitch. There are also client suitability, money laundering and cybersecurity concerns that need to be addressed for institutional investors to embrace cryptocurrencies at scale.

While the month kicked off strong, sentiment has deteriorated rather quickly.”  Previous episodes of negative sentiment preceded price rises similar to last September and this July, as shown in the chart below.  Bitcoin futures volume rises relative to spot market  “The importance of the bitcoin futures market is growing,” Arcane Research wrote in a Tuesday report. The daily trading volume in the bitcoin futures market has accounted for a growing share of total bitcoin trading volume, especially over the past few months.  BTC spot trading volume accounted for 20% of total trading volume at the beginning of the year, and now sits well below 10%.  “January until May saw a huge spot volume, with a slight drop in April,” Arcane Research wrote. “During this time, the institutional narrative was strong.”  Spot trading volume rose over the past few weeks as volatility increased, but it remains well below the levels seen in May.  Trend improvement for altcoins relative to bitcoin  The uptrend in alternative cryptocurrencies has improved relative to bitcoin over the past few months as some traders diversify their crypto holdings.  “Smaller cryptocurrencies have fallen out of favor over the past week, but we think only temporarily, noting the trajectory of the weekly RRG (relative rotation graph, seen below) is likely to continue turning in favor of the likes of Polkadot (DOT) and Chainlink (LINK),” said Katie Stockton, managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, a technical research firm.  The 12-week RRG chart (click here for animation) shows the intermediate-term cyclicality of altcoins relative to bitcoin. The graph’s clockwise rotation holds promise for altcoins in the intermediate term, although BTC could retain leadership over the short term, according to Stockton.

42376182,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwHI4J,1631651655,Synthetix’s SNX Token Jumps as DeFi Project Lyra Sets New Rewards Program,"The blockchain-based derivatives protocol Synthetix saw its SNX tokens jump in price Tuesday after another project, Lyra, announced a rewards program tied to the protocol’s sUSD stablecoins.  In order to mint new sUSD coins, traders need to first get the SNX tokens and then lock them into the Synthetix platform via a process known as staking.  Lyra, a decentralized options-trading platform launched in late August, says it wants to increase the supply of sUSD on Optimistic Ethereum – a so-called “layer 2” network that’s used to speed up and reduce the cost of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Lyra wrote Monday in a blog post that it relies on Synthetix’s sUSD tokens “as both a source of liquidity and a means of exchange.”  Under Lyra’s new “trial liquidity mining program,” some 750,000 LYRA tokens will be made available to liquidity providers. The LYRA tokens haven’t been released for trading in cryptocurrency markets, and so the value of the rewards isn’t yet clear in dollar terms.  “The rewards earned during this program will be distributed when the LYRA token is officially launched,” the blog post, dated Monday, said. “More information about the LYRA token will be released in the coming weeks.”  Synthetix is protocol that allows users to mint digital replicas of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin as well as real-world assets like the U.S. dollar and oil. These “synthetic” tokens can then be used in decentralized finance, or DeFi, where traders can trade, lend or deposit tokens using automated, blockchain-based protocols.  As of press time, the SNX price was up 10% over the past 24 hours to $13.34, for a market capitalization of $1.5 billion.  The episode illustrates an increasingly common theme in cryptocurrency markets: digital assets jumping in price due to demand from DeFi traders who need them to cash in on token giveaways. Many cryptocurrency projects offer these reward programs to market themselves and provide incentives to new users.  According to Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital, the Lyra project’s rewards program depends heavily on people getting SNX so that they can stake it, get the sUSD and start the process of trying to qualify for the Lyra rewards program.  “This specifically targets SNX stakers, and therefore is contributing to its rise,” said Vinokourov.  Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, said that “this has been something discussed and anticipated in the Synthetix community.”  He noted that the number of addresses holding the SNX token has climbed to an all-time high, closing in on 100,000: “This shows a growing community of participants for the Synthetix ecosystem,” Outumuro said.",POSITIVE,SNX,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SNX | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/14/synthetixs-snx-token-jumps-as-defi-project-lyra-sets-new-rewards-program,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6363568dbc880a028d7e2eb49e434f7ecc298b47-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As posted by an analyst on CryptoQuant, the historical chart for the Gemini netflow (30-day MA) vs the price reveals there could be a correlation between the indicator and BTC tops. The Bitcoin netflow here refers to the net number of coins exiting or entering the crypto exchange Gemini. The indicator&apos;s value is simply calculated by taking the difference between the inflows and the outflows. When the netflow takes negative values, it means more BTC is moving out of the exchange than in. During such periods, investors are withdrawing their coins to personal wallets, either for hodling or for selling through OTC deals. Similarly, positive values imply that investors are moving their Bitcoin to exchanges for altcoin purchasing or withdrawing to fiat.

42376298,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6A5IB,1631642541,Crypto Isn’t the Cause of Ransomware. It Might Be the Cure,"In the wake of the ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline, we have witnessed an assault on the payment mechanism, cryptocurrency. A recent New York Times op-ed even went as far as to suggest the use of offensive cyber warfare to disrupt cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Earlier this summer, a Wall Street Journal opinion piece titled, “Ban Cryptocurrency to Fight Ransomware,” argued, “We can live in a world with cryptocurrency or a world without ransomware, but we can’t have both.”  At a recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the committee’s chairman, asked, “Cryptocurrency and bitcoin are the coin of the realm when it comes to ransomware. What can we do – what specific laws should we enact in the United States to be responsive to this and diminish the role of cryptocurrency?”  A Department of Justice official responded, “I agree that cryptocurrency has unfortunately fueled this rise of crime. It has two key aspects to it. It’s often anonymous and non-reversible. Once it passed to the criminals, it is very difficult to claw it back.”  Ari Redbord is head of legal and government affairs for TRM Labs, a blockchain intelligence company. Previously, he was an Assistant United States Attorney and senior adviser to the Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence at the United States Treasury Department.  However, the reality is quite the opposite. While cryptocurrency allows ransom payments at the speed of the internet, making it attractive to illicit actors, the blockchain – the open ledger on which crypto lives and moves – allows law enforcement to track and trace the flow of funds in real time, providing unprecedented visibility on financial flows.  For example, in the Colonial Pipeline attack, law enforcement was able to track and ultimately seize the ransom payment. That recovery was possible only because cryptocurrency was the medium of payment. In other words, cryptocurrencies, far from being anonymous, allow law enforcement and regulators visibility on financial transactions in real time. Rather than being the cause of ransomware, crypto could very well be the solution.  In the recent New York Times op-ed, Paul Rosenzweig, former deputy assistant secretary for policy at the Department of Homeland Security, opined that with “alarming regularity, cybercriminals disrupt computer systems controlling important pieces of infrastructure and refuse to restore access until they are paid.”  Rosenzweig is right; cybercriminals, terrorist financiers, weapons proliferators and rogue nation state actors have moved online, launching attacks at unprecedented speed and scale. In the wake of the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack, FBI Director Christopher Wray compared recent cyberattacks to 9/11. As we confront this post-9/11 world, one thing is certain, the battlefield has shifted to the digital space. But law enforcement also has the tools necessary to combat cybercriminals where they live.  Read More: Don’t Blame Bitcoin for Ransomware | Dan Kuhn  The Biden administration has focused its efforts on the need for close interagency and public private coordination. The Department of Justice has ordered U.S. attorney’s offices across the country to coordinate cases involving ransomware and other cyberattacks with a newly created task force, raising these cases to the level of terrorism investigations. The White House, in a letter to business leaders, provided a playbook of best practices to harden cyber defenses against attacks from malicious actors.  While law enforcement and policy makers are focused on upgrading cyber defense and responsiveness, the sea of critics, instead, focus on cryptocurrency. For example, Rosenzweig argues that cryptocurrency is the root cause of ransomware attacks, allowing cybercriminals to “‘kidnap’ a company from afar and receive payment anonymously and securely.”  How should we neutralize the ransomware threat? He suggests stricter regulation, or if that doesn’t work, the use of offensive cyber warfare to hack and disrupt cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency exchanges. Not only would that be an attack on the tens of millions of law-abiding Americans who own and use bitcoin and the many legitimate businesses that make up the cryptocurrency industry, but it would be akin to having destroyed the early web in the 1990s because criminals also abused it.  Rosenzweig’s argument, and that of the “ban crypto” set, is predicated on the conclusion that the “[t]he United States does not have a ransomware problem so much as it has an anonymous ransom problem.” However, that does not take into account the ability of law enforcement, through the use of sophisticated blockchain analytics tools, to trace transactions, and ultimately, through great police work, to identify and potentially seize stolen funds. This type of investigation would not be possible had an illicit actor used another form of payment.  Rosenzweig points to the use of on-chain obfuscation techniques, such as the use of mixers or tumblers – services that combine cryptocurrencies and redistribute them – as an example of the need for additional regulation and something that would “be illegal in the non-virtual world.”  While the use of mixers is, in and of itself, not a crime, the Department of Justice has recently prosecuted and convicted individuals who conspire to launder funds through the use of these mixers. Just like in the off-chain world, you must have the intent to commit a crime. That is also true on-chain. To be convicted of money laundering, you have to possess the intent to launder the proceeds of illicit activity. In fact, because of the nature of the open ledger, and the use of blockchain analytics, it is far easier to track and trace the flow of funds across the blockchain than it is to track cash flowing through networks of shell companies and hawalas across the globe.  Without question, we need a clear legislative and regulatory framework for cryptocurrency that mitigates the risk from illicit actors, while, at the same time, encourages and promotes innovation. Anti-money laundering and cybersecurity are critical infrastructure for this new financial system – the internet of money. However, crypto exchanges are already regulated under the same laws as other money service businesses by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and are required to maintain robust risk-based compliance programs, which include transaction monitoring for exposure to terrorist financing, ransomware and other illicit activity.  Cryptocurrency is not the problem. In fact, it could very well be the solution. With the right tools, financial crime investigators are able to trace and track the flow of funds, build out ransomware networks and understand typologies of illicit activity on the blockchain in ways unimaginable in the fiat world.  We don’t talk about banning cash because of money laundering or bulk-cash smuggling. Instead, we focus on thwarting illicit actors behind that activity and hardening our defenses against them. There is one difference, however: In crypto we actually have the tools to follow the money.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | WALLET,Ari Redbord,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/14/crypto-isnt-the-cause-of-ransomware-it-might-be-the-cure,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fb6c880f4b08f8e2e1c9e73f48298b82f307c485-1024x682.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424675,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHVkFh,1631642234,Play-to-Earn Is Already the Biggest Star in the Metaverse,"If you want to play the role of God, you can’t overlook the fish. This is the implied message of a woman named Kelsei, aka “Pandapops,” who, over a video live-stream, gives a class on how to create digital worlds. Imagine an empty grid. Then the grid is filled with an aquarium, water and spooky fish. One of the fish has creepy eyes. One has a weird little tail. One looks like an alien.  Pandapops is upbeat and friendly, with a British accent and bright blue hair. “I really wanted the aquarium to look like there’s depth to it,” she explains.  For the next two hours she meticulously creates and tweaks her digital assets: She adds splash effects to the aquarium, she grows a flower and paints it an eerie shade of blue, she completes her “witch’s cottage.” (The asset’s meta-description: “Witch’s cottage: humble home for any aspiring woodland witch.”)  Jeff Wilser is the author of seven books including “Alexander Hamilton’s Guide to Life,” “The Book of Joe: The Life, Wit, and (Sometimes Accidental) Wisdom of Joe Biden” and an Amazon Best Book of the Month in both non-fiction and humor.  The work is strangely fascinating, like a 2021 version of watching Bob Ross paint. Soon the virtual world begins to expand. Pandapops finishes her aquarium, drops it into a tavern, then plunks the tavern itself into a village she has created, nestling it between a patch of trees.  The village is alive with people, and now it becomes clear that she’s designing a game. “This guy doesn’t give us quests yet, but he will,” Pandapops said of the barkeep, who, like all of the tiny avatars, look a bit like characters from the Lego movies. “That’s a bounty hunter,” she said. And soon we see our protagonist, the proverbial “player one,” who jogs through a courtyard with a cute little sword.  Pandapops is not a professional game designer. She’s not an employee of Epic, Sony or Electronic Arts. She’s using a program called VoxelEdits to create a game for The Sandbox, the newest blockchain-enabled metaverse, which launches its “public alpha” in late September.  And she’s not alone. Even before the launch of the metaverse, there have been over 100,000 downloads of Sandbox’s Game Maker engine (currently in beta), according to Sebastien Borget, the company’s co-founder and COO. “Our Game Maker requires no code, and you can make games without any experience,” Borget said. “That’s what we’ve been building for over three years.”  Read more: A Crypto Guide to the Metaverse  They’ve actually been building for 10 years. Sandbox, which originally launched in 2011 as a normal and non-blockchain start-up, represents the shift from traditional gaming to crypto-gaming. Sandbox started as a mobile app. Borget said that while the app was downloaded 40 million times, “the success of the game came from the users.” These users created 70 million assets. None of them earned a nickel, which is typically the case with traditional games like Minecraft and Roblox. After Borget learned of CryptoKitties, CryptoPunks and the user-owned wizardry of NFTs, he flipped the model of Sandbox to a decentralized blockchain metaverse, which would “turn players into creators” and then “help players and creators monetize all the content they make.”  Let’s back up. For the non-blockchain obsessed, the metaverse is still something of an obscure and opaque concept. That could soon change. The New York Times is running metaverse explainers; traditional brands like Sotheby’s and Coca Cola are dipping into the metaverse; and perhaps most consequentially, Mark Zuckerberg has hitched Facebook’s future to this virtual star, telling employees over the summer that the company’s overarching goal is to “help bring the metaverse to life.”  Which begs the question, what is the metaverse, exactly? Is it just one platform, or the sum total of all? Ask 10 different people at a crypto conference, and you’ll get 10 different definitions. “We should not expect a single, all-illuminating definition of the ‘Metaverse,’” writes venture capitalist Matthew Ball. “The Metaverse is best understood as ‘a quasi-successor state to the mobile internet’. This is because the Metaverse will not fundamentally replace the internet, but instead build upon and iteratively transform it.”  This is why the stakes are so high. Maybe today and tomorrow, the metaverse is just an online virtual world – like Decentraland, Crypto Voxel and The Sandbox – where you play a quick game, browse NFTs in an art gallery or have an online meet-up. This is the metaverse’s infancy. But in five or 10 or 20 years, perhaps the metaverse replaces much of what you do online, or even offline. Instead of a Zoom with your parents who live across the country, you join them for a metaverse game of tennis. Or instead of consuming the news on Twitter, maybe you’re dropped into a metaverse simulation of what’s happening in Afghanistan.  What path will we take to arrive at this metaverse future? Through the centralized, big tech route of Facebook? Or through a new decentralized model? As NFT artist “6529.eth” framed the question in a viral Twitter thread, “What we are playing for is whether our children will be fully free or residents in a digital company universe – with the illusion of free, but not really free.”  Covid, art, zombies  I first visited Decentraland a year ago. While I was intrigued by the world’s potential, it felt a touch under-populated. “I’ll be honest with you, we released a product before it was really ready,” said Sam Hamilton, who’s the community and events lead at Decentraland Foundation. “So we rolled our sleeves up.” The team pumped out more content, more events – art exhibits, conferences, music festivals, “ questshttps://decentraland.org/blog/announcement/decentraland-quests-the-journey-begins/” – and the crowds rolled in. Monthly users jumped from 7,000 to 70,000.  A few things help explain that growth: the boom in NFTs, the surge of play-to-earn crypto games and maybe even the pandemic. “COVID is a terrible, terrible thing, and we’ve all suffered greatly,” said Voxel Bunny, lead artist at Sandbox. (They use a pseudonym for anonymity.) “At the same time, going online is the norm. The metaverse feels even more approachable and appealing.”  The metaverse can be a home for art. And we now live in a world where celebrities like Steph Curry, Grimes, Paris Hilton, Jack Dorsey and Shawn Mendes are buying or minting NFTs. Suddenly the metaverse has newfound relevance, or even urgency. How do you showcase your art? How do you flaunt your Ape NFT? Decentraland’s Art District is one of the world’s standout features, creating a more immersive way to admire NFTs than to just stare at your phone. Artists are pouncing on the opportunity. The NFT collection “World of Women” – featuring 10,000 women, with an emphasis on diversity and inclusion – plans to buy a chunk of land in Sandbox, and then build a museum to hang paintings and animations.  “Is ‘metaverse maximalist’ a term yet?” asks Gordon Goner, one of the anonymous co-founders of The Bored Ape Yacht Club. Goner is a Metaverse Maximalist. (He just coined the term.) “I’m feeling fairly confident that we’re less than 20 years out from the “Ready Player One” experience,” said Goner. The Bored Apes are planting roots in both Decentraland and Sandbox; Goner said the club’s plan for Sandbox is still a “state secret,” but that you’ll be able to walk around in the metaverse as your three-dimensional “ape.” In Decentraland, you and your degenerates can hang in the Bored Ape Yacht Club riverboat casino.  And the metaverse, in turn, is investing in art. On Sept. 7, the Sandbox purchased one of the rarest Bored Apes, “The Captain,” for 740 ETH, or roughly $2.4 million. “We strongly believe that culture, whether games, music, visual arts, will be one of the pillars of the open crypto metaverse,” The Sandbox explained at the time. “We don’t just build and sell. We invest and help build the ecosystem.”  The building of that ecosystem is no longer just the work of spunky crypto startups, but also includes splashy brands. Sandbox’s partners include Atari, The Smurfs and “The Walking Dead.” Why zombies? “The Walking Dead” partnership gives at least two ways for Sandbox to create sticky content: First, the metaverse held “land sales” for people to buy coveted digital real-estate next to “Walking Dead” locations on the map, like the prison that featured prominently on the show. (Only in the upside-down world of crypto would land next to a zombie-prison be more valuable.) Second, the “Walking Dead” IP can be used as NFTs for games you create on Sandbox, boosting the crossover appeal.

Hamilton said that in the “early days” of the metaverse (last year), the only brands they partnered with were crypto players like Binance, Skale and Kraken. Then came Atari. Then came Sotheby’s, which opened a virtual art gallery in the metaverse. As the head of sales at Sotheby’s, Michael Bouhanna, told theartnewspaper, “We see spaces like Decentraland as the next frontier for digital art.”  Then came Coca-Cola. Decentraland created a “can-top party” where you could swim inside a bottle of Coke and experience being inside the bubbles. It’s easy to see the mutual benefits: The metaverse gets compelling content, the traditional brands get engaged eyeballs. “We loved how Decentraland embraced the brand and created unique experiences,” a Coke executive later said. “We loved seeing NFT and metaverse artists take the iconicity of the brand and put a fresh, modern twist on it.”  And then came the games.  To (Axie) Infinity and beyond  Crypto play-to-earn games, such as Axie Infinity and Alien Worlds, have exploded. (You’ll find a fine primer here.) I tried playing Axie as a stunt for this article. You start by purchasing three Axies, cute little cartoon blobby creatures, that you then breed and send to battle. At the time of my attempt, the cheapest of these blobs cost $200, which put the entry fee at around $600 ... and thus ended the shortest experiment in my writing career. Other gamers are bolder (or they got in before the prices skyrocketed), as Axie claims to have 250,000 daily active players and 90,000 ETH (or over $300 million) traded in its in-house marketplace.  “Everyone is looking at the success of Axie [Infinity] and saying, ‘Wow, this is definitely the future,’” said Decentraland’s Hamilton. He adds that it’s only part of the metaverse future, as “gaming isn’t everything,” but for many, it seems to be the real draw. Hamilton said that while events (such as the “To the Moon” music festival) provide spikes of traffic, play-to-earn crypto games have been “the most popular stuff on Decentraland on a consistent basis.”  And this takes us back to The Sandbox, to the live-streaming of Pandapops, and to the make-your-own-game ecosystem. The Sandbox is betting on games. Their “Game Maker” console allows you to create games (even complicated quest games) from scratch, such as the one Pandapops is working on, with the aquarium and the tavern: Your character will start the game with no memories, you will unlock the memories along your journey, and you’ll need to find a way to escape a maze. Eventually, you will free a once-evil ogre from the ogre king.  Honestly? The concept feels a bit flimsy, and Pandapops would later tell me with a laugh, “I’m not very good at the game-maker side of things.” (Her passion is live-streaming for blockchain gaming, which she does for both herself and Sandbox.) Yet some of the games are far more complex, thanks to an early decision by Sandbox. The company bankrolled a “Creator Fund,” recruiting digital artists to build the assets that would breathe life into this new metaverse.  “We wanted to make sure that when we open a virtual world, it’s not going to be like an empty mall,” said Borget. So they incentivized artists in two ways: 1) Compensation for creating the artwork, and then 2) If the artist is able to sell their art to someone on the Sandbox marketplace, they pocket 100% of the proceeds, with Sandbox taking an extra 5% commission. “It’s unbelievable. In all the years I’ve been making art, since 2007, I’ve never seen anything like it,” said Voxel Bunny, who once sold a Witch Tower for 3,150 SAND, or roughly $2,300 in today’s prices.  Then there’s the Game Maker fund. 450 artists and 54 studios, according to Borget, have been funded to create Sandbox games. One of these 54 studios is Sand Rush, co-founded by Christopher Weller, who goes by the alias of Necrobombicon. “I came into this industry as an artist,” said Weller. “I learned that Sandbox was willing to pay its artists with cryptocurrency.”  First he thought he’d bang out some assets himself, then he met other like-minded artists on the Sandbox Discord. They created a game studio, Sand Rush, that creates elaborate games like Jungle Rush, described as “a place of old magic, mystery and lore,” where “ancient technologies lurk in the shadows.” He has already found Sandbox to be lucrative. Sand Rush collaborated on the creation of “The Shrine of Truth,” a mystical structure meant as a centerpiece for someone’s digital land, and sold it for 100,000 SAND, or roughly $100k at current prices.  Beeple’s $69 million this is not, but now imagine a pipeline of artists who can sell their NFTs in the marketplace, which in turn can be used to build games. That’s already happening. Borget said that the Sandbox creator’s economy has topped $48 million in volume (pre-launch), with over 350,000 wallets created.  What’s in this Sandbox marketplace? As of the time of this writing, you could buy a “pool party cool guy” for $42, a beach van for $787, a tree house $840 and a “crazy pool” for $525 (it’s not at all clear how the pool is crazy). This is at the low-end. For those on a more luxurious budget, you might want to consider an “ancient magic statue” for $3,150 (it is neither ancient nor magic), a “robot incubator” for $10,429 or a “summer rock metal band” for $5,214.  On the one hand, sure, to state the obvious, you can hire an actual rock metal band, which plays actual music, for less than $5,214. Then again, this marketplace enables creators to be compensated for their work. “It’s an exciting moment in history, where suddenly a new sphere in work appears,” said Voxel Bunny. “Suddenly there are new jobs that were not here a few years back.”  This feels refreshingly concrete. While much of the capital sloshing around the crypto ecosystem is difficult to understand or process, here’s an example of the rising tide of crypto prices directly helping artists. This could have a domino effect. First Voxel Bunny creates the Witch Tower and sells it for $2,300, then perhaps a buyer – a game creator – uses it in a quest that she herself will monetize. Now the players of this game will earn crypto as they try and solve the quest, completing the virtuous cycle. Sure, speculation and profit-seeking is part of the model, but is that really any different than the profit-seeking of billion-dollar gaming corporations?  Enter Darth Vader  Decentraland or The Sandbox? Or maybe Crypto Voxels? Or another of the many metaverse projects popping up, such as Realm or Neon District? Which one “wins”? The various metaverse projects, at least for now, seem to view each other as more cooperative than competitive. “I don’t think it’s a winner-take-all situation,” said Decentraland’s Hamilton, who thinks that just as there’s room for a Twitter and Facebook and Snapchat and Tik-Tok – each playing a different role – there will be space for multiple platforms in the metaverse. Sandbox’s Borget said that “each one has a different strength,” with Decentraland more aligned with events, Crypto Voxels as “more simple and accessible,” and Sandbox with gaming.  But finally, of course, we have the issue that looms over all of this. It’s what I’ll call The Darth Vader Scenario.  In a weird coincidence, on the very same day I spoke to many of these crypto-metaverse advocates, I happened to visit a buddy who wanted to show off his new “Oculus,” a virtual reality headset. It’s made by Facebook. It’s the gateway to Horizons, Zuckerberg’s plan for the metaverse.  I slipped on the VR goggles, completed a quick tutorial, and then gasped as I found myself on the top of a skyscraper.  A virtual city enveloped me. Blue sky, honking cars, planes overhead – it all looked real. Maybe not quite photorealistic, but real enough so that when I peeked over the edge of the skyscraper, my stomach lurched at the sight of the ground far below. I don’t have a fear of heights. And my brain knew that in reality, yes, of course, I was safely in my friend’s living room. That didn’t matter. When I “walked the plank” to step out from the edge of the skyscraper, looking down at the 100-story drop beneath me, I was both terrified and thrilled.  Read more: Inside Alien Worlds, the Biggest Game in the Metaverse  “Jump off the plank!” My friend urged me.  “No way.”  “Do it!”  Below me was certain death. I hesitated. What tipped me over the edge, literally and figuratively, was the sound of my friend’s young son in the background, laughing at my cowardice. Finally, I jumped off the edge of the plank … and of course, landed safely on the carpet of the living room. It was exhilarating.  I then rode a virtual roller coaster, played a virtual shooter game, and then – to the delight of my inner 12-year-old – played a virtual reality (VR) game of Star Wars, complete with Darth Vader himself. I wanted to buy an Oculus. The game and the VR tech is not particularly new, but it’s one thing to know that in the abstract, and it’s another to see it and feel it in your bones.  While a blockchain metaverse might win every argument on the principles – empowering players, decentralizing the tech, actual ownership of digital assets– in practice, for the average user, how does that stack up to the easy lure of flying through the air or clashing lightsabers with Darth Vader? The tech behemoths have seemingly every advantage: bottomless resources, easy access to brands (Avengers metaverse?) and, in the case of Facebook, a built-in user base of 2.8 billion. Blockchain is still the underdog.  I thought back again to Pandapop’s humble aquarium, with the creepy fish and the splash effects that she painstakingly added. I thought of her simple game where you need to escape a maze and slay the ogre king. It’s true that Pandapops could own that aquarium, monetize her game and claim a legitimate sense of empowerment. (It’s also true, of course, that the blockchain games will likely get more sophisticated in time, especially as creators are incentivized to make more.)  But will the average gamer care?  Just look at the internet. For decades, most of us have chosen – whether we knew it or not – the sugary speed and convenience of big tech centralization. Even if it cost our privacy or agency, we enjoyed our stored passwords, auto log-ins and using Google, Apple, Facebook et al. to make our digital lives smoother.  We preferred a centralized Darth Vader to the decentralized maze. Time will tell if we choose differently in the metaverse.",POSITIVE,ETH,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MANA,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/14/play-to-earn-is-already-the-biggest-star-in-the-metaverse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d16f2ed99f09f6449b560ffa348981ff7dfd0014-1846x1038.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421745,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpJzJ,1631638851,What Epic vs. Apple Means for Crypto,"Where oh where is the metaverse? Not on the Apple App Store, apparently.  A heated legal battle between Apple and Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, may have opened the door to allowing cryptocurrency purchases within the tech giant’s iOS ecosystem. In the much-watched case, Epic argued that the tech giant maintained a monopoly over its App Store and engaged in anti-competitive practices by requiring all in-game purchases be routed through Apple’s proprietary payment system (for which it charges a hefty 30% commission).  U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of the Northern District of California issued a permanent injunction Friday loosening this restriction: Apple must now give users the choice to buy digital goods on the App Store or exit the app to buy directly from developers on the web, though the 30% fee remains.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  That is a victory for consumers, but it leaves a lot of questions unanswered. The first big case against a Big Tech company in the U.S. largely left Apple’s monopoly in place, and could have significant repercussions for the development of interoperable, open and user-centered worlds colloquially called the metaverse. In fact, Gonzalez Rogers punted on defining the term:  “At this time, the general market does not appear to recognize the metaverse and its corresponding game modes in Fortnite as anything separate and apart from the video game market,” she said. (She also didn’t define what makes a game a game, essentially saying you know it when you see it.)  Although not central to its case, Epic was taking a stand on the future of gaming and app development. Accelerated by crypto, digital reality is trending toward a world where virtual identities can move seamlessly across platforms, where digital goods can actually be owned and where the internet “feels” as real as meatspace. This is apart from the web we know, where large swaths are owned, maintained and controlled by centralized parties like Apple, Facebook and Google.  A functioning metaverse will require that payments be instantaneous and that commerce can spring up naturally between two consenting parties without restriction. Friday’s ruling moves us a step of the way there, by enabling developers to sell digital items directly to players. In practice, we don’t know what that will look like: Users may be forced to leave games, open a separate browser and enter their credit card information – a far greater hassle than a one-tap buy Apple Pay enables.  Indeed, Apple still has a vice grip over its iOS operating system. Although users can be “steered” toward other payment options, it appears that all goods that are sold must also be offered by Apple. That means goods on the forefront of cultural acceptance – like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) – are still in a gray area for iOS users.  Read more: A Crypto Guide to the Metaverse  Reportedly, Apple is blocking an update to wallet service Gnosis Safe, on the grounds that NFTs are “not appropriate for the App Store,” according to an email from an app store reviewer, tweeted out by Gnosis developer Lukas Schor this morning. Gnosis allows users to store NFTs and other crypto assets.  “Since NFT are digital assets that have a price and cost associated with them. App’s [sic] that access, whether it is just simple storage or marketplace, are not appropriate for the App Store. We suggest that you remove this feature from your app,” the email read.  And then, in a separate email, the review continued: “Specifically, app that access previously purchased digital content must make the digital content available to App Store users as in-app purchases.”  CoinDesk has not verified the emails, but if this is true, it seems remarkably shortsighted. There could soon be a day where my train tickets, music and restaurant reservations are all stored as NFTs on my phone.

42376201,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwHI5Z,1631637288,Layer 2 Network Arbitrum Experiences Hourlong Network Outage,"During a rocky Tuesday morning that saw a thwarted attack on layer 1 network Ethereum and an ongoing network outage for fellow smart contract platform Solana, layer 2 Ethereum scaling solution Arbitrum also experienced an outage of roughly an hour, leading to widespread commiseration between traders and DeFi farmers across various ecosystems.  Starting at 10:30 a.m. ET, users on Twitter and in Arbitrum’s official Discord Support channel began reporting problems with the network. Users could not process transactions, and chain explorers showed that blocks had ceased to validate.  The team acknowledged the outage in a tweet.  Traders, investors and farmers poked fun at the seemingly unrelated outages on two increasingly popular networks:  At 11:28 a.m.ET Offchain Labs director AJ Warner announced on Discord that “Arbitrum One is back online and operational,” and that the team would publish more information on the outage later today. The Arbitrum team did not respond to a request for comment by press time.  Read More: Inside Arbitrum’s Staggered Mainnet Launch  The layer 2 was experiencing a run of success leading up to Tuesday’s outage, with its closely watched total value locked (TVL) metric spiking as high as $2 billion as “meme farms” – DeFi products that implement existing verticals with unsustainably high liquidity mining rewards – attracted traders and gamblers to the chain.  Key DeFi protocol Curve also announced the launch of an implementation on the network late Monday night:  In an interview with CoinDesk in August, Warner and Offchain Labs co-founder Steven Goldfeder said that the rollout of the network would be more of a process than a moment, contrary to the desires of Ethereum users eager for scaling solutions.  “We’re very excited, very humbled by the support we’ve gotten,” said Goldfeder of the network’s launch. “Today’s the day we can finally provide scaling for the Ethereum user. But as exciting as that is, we’re rolling up our sleeves because there’s still work to be done.

The firm’s seventh venture fund is 75% larger than the preceding $200 million fund of October 2019.  One of the beneficiaries of Jump Capital’s earlier investments in crypto was Mexico-based exchange Bitso, which worked with El Salvador’s government in developing the Chivo wallet for the country’s citizens following El Salvador’s adoption of bitcoin as legal tender. Jump Capital joined a $62 million funding round into Bitso led by technology company Ripple in 2019.  As with previous funds, Jump Capital is eyeing early-stage investments in sectors such as fintech, IT infrastructure and B2B software as a service. However, the fund will have “an increased concentration on the evolving crypto ecosystem,” it announced Tuesday.  The fund will focus on base infrastructure layers, decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming and Web 3.0.

42376171,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwHHqT,1631633982,Bitcoin Bounces to 200-Day Moving Average Ahead of US CPI Data as China’s Evergrande Warns of Default,"Bitcoin has bounced to a key resistance level, dismissing weakness in stocks and the financial woes of property giant China Evergrande. The relief, however, could be short-lived if U.S. inflation continued to run hot in August.  According to FXStreet, the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) is expected to have risen by 5.3% year-on-year last month following July’s 5.4% rise. The data is scheduled for release at 12:30 UTC.  “If inflation comes in above forecast, it will reaffirm investor views that the Federal Reserve will need to think more about price stability,” Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Digital, said. “This will likely weigh on risk assets, which could ripple into short-term negative sentiment towards bitcoin.”  As discussed Monday, an above-5% inflation figure may speed up the Fed’s plans to begin unwinding the long-running liquidity-booting stimulus program by the end of the year. That could weigh on asset prices in general.  As of now, bitcoin investors don’t seem to be worried about the possibility of the U.S. CPI boosting the odds of the so-called Fed taper. The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading above the 200-day moving average (MA) resistance at $45,866, a 1.7% gain on the day.  Stocks, however, are trading weak on caution ahead of the release. Major European indexes are nursing moderate losses alongside flat-to-negative action in the S&P 500 futures.  Evergrande’s Crisis  Mainland Chinese stocks tanked early today along with those in Hong Kong, as shares in property developer China Evergrande fell 10% after the company signaled a possibility of a “significant continuing decline in contract sales in September.”  Bitcoin remains unnerved by the growing risk of an Evergrande default despite the lingering speculation that Tether was securing its stablecoin tether, or USDT, with commercial paper issued by the real estate company. Tether – with a market value of $68 billion, the largest stablecoin – has penetrated every corner of the crypto market. As such, a loss of confidence in tether could deliver a severe liquidity shock to the broader market.  “With almost $850 million of loan repayments left in 2021 and the company in a downward spiral, the questions surrounding Tether and Evergrande may be about to be answered,” Coinbase Institutional said in a weekly email dated Sept. 10.  According to Adam Cochran, a partner with Cinneamhain Ventures, an Evergrande collapse could send shock waves around the world. “Regardless of what commercial paper you hold, bonds and commercial paper would take a hit and some issuers may even fold,” Cochran said in a tweet thread published early today. “Currently both Tether and Circle [the company behind stablecoin USDC] hold commercial paper, and while I think it unlikely that either would have large swaths of Evergrande bonds, the whole market will reel a bit.”  Matthew Dibb, co-founder and chief operating officer of Stack Funds, voiced similar concerns, saying that “Asian equities look miserable and we are worried about contagion of risk-off flowing to crypto.”  Mid-week bounce?  Bitcoin may establish a secure foothold above the 200-day moving average if the U.S. inflation figure misses estimates by a big margin, forcing traders to scale back taper expectations. That would expose the recent peak near $53,000.  “We expect an oversold bounce mid-week when a counter-trend signal is likely per the DeMark indicators, and it would likely dispel the overbought downturn on the weekly chart,” Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, said in a weekly note published Monday.  The cryptocurrency fell by 11% a week ago and has been trading between $43,000 to $47,500 ever since. Prices fell by more than 2% on Monday as U.S. stocks dropped on fear of potential corporate tax hikes.

Ethereum’s mainnet is now operating normally, and the attack is unlikely to be replicated at a larger scale, according to Ethereum researcher and Go Ethereum software client developer Marius Van Der Wijden.  The attack was first flagged by Alex S. of Flexpool on the Ethereum R&D Discord shortly after 3 a.m. Eastern time. “Anything wrong with the mainnet again?” he wrote, referring to a chain split that occurred on the network in late August.  Read more: Ethereum Faces Chain Split as Node Operators Fail to Update Geth Hotfix  He noted that some of his nodes were recording the “highest block” of the chain at a block number that technically did not exist, as it was set at a sum greater than the “current block.”  Researchers speculated in Discord that the cause was a peer publishing a version of the chain with invalid proof-of-work.  Van Der Wijden told CoinDesk the attack was “experimental” in nature.  “Someone published an invalid chain that was rejected by most clients. ~25% of Nethermind clients accepted the invalid chain,” Van Der Wijden wrote. “Judging from ethernodes, ~20 nodes were affected or 0.8% of the network. I don’t think it was a directed attack against nethermind, but rather someone experimenting and validating their experiment on the live network.”  Tomasz Stańczak, founder of Ethereum infrastructure company Nethermind, posted on Twitter that a public statement would be forthcoming.  Van Der Wijden noted that due to the nature of the attack, it is unlikely that a similar exploit could scale to a degree to have a major impact on the network. Ethereum is validating blocks normally.  Van Der Wijden also noted that a diversity of clients is key for the health of the network, particularly as it prepares for a transition to a new proof-of-stake consensus model.  “Especially with the switch to proof-of-stake, client diversity is extremely important as a well-balanced distribution of clients greatly decreases the probability of creating an invalid chain,” he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/14/experimental-early-morning-attack-temporarily-diverts-8-of-ethereum-nodes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d10319e638ceed96110c81e61527826f3f220723-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a new note, he said COIN stock has also been hurt by news of a Wells notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over a forthcoming lending product from the cryptocurrency exchange.  Coinbase shares are down 4% in the third quarter, while bitcoin and ether prices have gained ~28% and ~43%, respectively. Coinbase consensus estimates for 3Q appear to be too low, Repetto wrote.  While he cut his third quarter earnings per share (EPS) estimates to $2.08 from $2.21, he thinks most other analysts assumed “much lower” volume run rates given Coinbase’s pre-announced “soft” crypto volumes in July.  “We suspect most estimates will need to come up with the current 3Q21 consensus EPS estimate at $1.30,” Repetto wrote.  Read more: Coinbase Goes Public in Its Fight With the SEC  Repetto, who has an overweight rating and $335 price target on the shares, said the crypto exchange’s decision to delay Coinbase Lend until October doesn’t impact his forward estimates because he never modeled Lend into his current or future revenue estimates.  “While we don’t believe it’s in any company’s best interest to confront their regulators, still (1) COIN has a history of working in close collaboration with regulators, and (2) we believe regulatory clarity & transparency is what the crypto industry could most utilize at this time,” Repetto wrote.  Separately, Moody’s on Monday assigned the planned $1.5 billion of debt that Coinbase is selling a Ba1 rating. Coinbase announced that it will sell the debt through a private offering and will use the funds for general corporate purpose, including product development and possible acquisitions.  Moody’s also assigned a Ba2 corporate family rating (CFR) to Coinbase.  “The firm has a leading franchise in offering crypto-based services to a large number of retail and institutional customers and has benefitted from strong revenue and earnings growth in recent periods,” Moody’s said in a statement. “However, the firm’s profitability and cash flow are almost entirely dependent upon the price and trading volume of cryptocurrencies, leaving it at risk of a substantial reduction in these factors.

42421754,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpKAf,1631629097,Coinbase Goes Public in Its Fight With the SEC,"Coinbase might be picking a fight with the SEC over its (maybe still pending?) Lend product. While the legal/regulatory questions are interesting, the way the San Francisco-based crypto exchange is approaching this fight is what’s really capturing my attention.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  A security by any other name  The narrative  Coinbase disclosed last week that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) viewed its proposed Coinbase Lend product as a possible security requiring registration and sent it a Wells Notice, a formal warning.  Why it matters  The SEC’s views on crypto lending extend well beyond Coinbase and its yet-to-be-launched product – several companies already offer such services. The SEC’s view on this specific market may hint that we will see more enforcement actions against the already live products. However, in announcing the SEC’s conclusions, Coinbase is also playing an interesting public relations game that is worth keeping an eye on, even if it’s unclear what sort of effect it might have on the legal questions.  Breaking it down  After Coinbase announced it had received a Wells Notice, the conversation on my Twitter feed generally broke down into two camps: There were non-crypto lawyers who believed that Coinbase Lend was definitely a security, while crypto lawyers were more inclined to view the SEC’s actions as being unhelpful or vague.  There are really two points of interest at play here. The first is the regulatory issue, which we’ll get to. But the other is the public relations game that Coinbase is playing. While this may affect the regulatory issue, the public relations game is its own beast, and this isn’t the first time we’ve seen it. It’s really not clear to me how effective it is, but it is absolutely fascinating to watch.  Coinbase isn’t the first company to proactively announce it may be sued by federal regulators (*cough* the SEC). Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also revealed that Ripple had received a Wells Notice, ahead of the SEC filing charges against the company.  Both Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Garlinghouse are pulling from Kik and Ted Livingston’s playbook, arguably more successfully.  Kik revealed in January 2019 that the SEC had sent it a Wells Notice (basically the regulator’s way of formally announcing it had enough evidence to support a civil enforcement action against a company) to the messaging platform.  Kik ultimately settled after the SEC sued the company, alleging that its initial coin offering violated securities laws.  In December, Garlinghouse similarly published Ripple’s Wells response.  The immediate takeaway could be that these companies are being transparent about their legal challenges. But they’re also, to some degree, mobilizing their customers.  A large number of the Ripple/SEC hearings have been open to the public by way of a phone line for people to dial in to. It’s still been almost impossible to dial in to listen to some of these hearings because they were maxed out. It’s almost as if the company, or its XRP asset, has an army of fans.  Interestingly, while Coinbase revealed it had received a Wells Notice, it has not yet published either the notice or its response, unlike Ripple and Kik. Two different spokespeople did not respond when I asked if it would.  Still, the public response to the SEC’s enforcement actions has been loudly critical. People want to invest in or trade these tokens or products, regardless of the SEC’s legal view.  For its part, the SEC has been typically tight-lipped on how it’s approaching these cases. Garlinghouse and Armstrong are leveraging that silence. Each executive publicly claimed to have engaged with the regulator for months before a Wells Notice was filed.  “The SEC has told us it wants to sue us over Lend. We don’t know why,” reads Coinbase’s blog post, which was written by Paul Grewal, the exchange’s chief legal officer and a former magistrate judge.  It’s a pretty one-sided battle in the court of public opinion (even if the SEC sub-tweeted Armstrong).  How that translates to a court of law remains to be seen.  Under federal law, notes, stocks and certificates of interest can all fall under the definition of a “security,” according to multiple lawyers I spoke to (these lawyers all spoke on background as they sometimes have to interact with the regulator).  The question for the SEC is: Does it consider an interest-bearing account to be, say, a certificate of interest?  “Maybe,” one of these lawyers said.  Another individual said the SEC typically doesn’t issue Wells Notices unless the enforcement attorneys at the agency are confident they can win the case.  However, it’s unusual for the SEC to issue a conditional Wells Notice – the agency is threatening to sue if Coinbase launches this not-yet-active product.  And if Coinbase’s Lend product is a security, it’s possible other crypto-related lending products also run afoul of federal securities laws.  “We asked if the SEC would share their reasoning with us, and yet again they refused. They have only told us that they are assessing our Lend product through the prism of decades-old Supreme Court cases called Howey and Reves. The SEC won’t share the assessment itself, only the fact that they have done it,” Coinbase’s blog post said.  Now, there’s a very real frustration with the SEC over its apparent refusal to publish bright-line guidance that companies can point to and say “yes, this is what we should keep in mind as we build things,” but the court precedents that Grewal mentioned are still well-established. Howey is one we’re all familiar with; we’ve been talking about it since the ICO bubble of 2017.  Reves isn’t a bright line, but courts have still carved out rules for defining when a note is or isn’t a security, said one of the lawyers I spoke to.  All that’s left is to see whether Coinbase still finds a way to launch Lend and how the SEC proceeds on crypto lending more generally.  Maybe the most confusing aspect of the SEC’s requests of Coinbase center around the personal information it wants. Grewal wrote that the agency asked for the name and contact information for everyone on the Lend wait list, but no reason for the request has been publicly made.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  President Joe Biden has officially announced he will nominate Rostin Behnam, the acting chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to serve a full term running the agency. He also plans to nominate Kristin Johnson, a law professor at Emory University specializing in “complex financial instruments,” and Christy Goldsmith Romero, a government official who is also an adjunct at the University of Virginia teaching cryptocurrency law, to be commissioners at the federal agency.  This comes after Commissioner Dan Berkovitz announced he plans to depart next month. Brian Quintenz, who left the CFTC on Aug. 31, has also accepted an advisory role at Andreessen Horowitz.  Elsewhere:  IRS Makes New Crypto Broker Guidance a ‘Priority’ in 2021-22 Plan: This is not related to the infrastructure bill, necessarily.

(Parachains are already live on Polkadot’s “canary” network, Kusama.)  Gearing up for that occasion, decentralized derivatives exchange dTrade, which will reside on Polkadot’s Moonbeam parachain, has raised a $22.3 million market-making fund to ensure a sufficient depth of liquidity at launch.  The market-making fund has been amassed with investment from big names like Alameda, Polychain, DeFiance, CMS, Hypersphere, Divergence and Altonomy. Last month, dTrade also received backing from the likes of Cumberland DRW and the DeFi Alliance.  The decentralized exchange (DEX), which raised a $6.4 million seed round back in May of this year, created an on-chain program to collect pledges of capital, which go directly to market-maker accounts – firms that place both buy and sell orders for some tradable asset and pocket the spread to provide liquidity on the exchange’s books.

But we can’t name them until legal agreements are signed.”  Solving the chicken-and-egg problem of attracting deep enough liquidity onto an exchange is a challenge, Jawaid said, adding that crypto pairs like BTC or DOT, the native asset on Polkadot, require around $600,000 to get trades flowing in a suitably efficient manner.  “You can see how each pair is expensive, and you need to have multiple pairs.

42421750,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpK4T,1631624405,The SEC to Coinbase: Crypto Banking Is Still Banking,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a Wells notice against Coinbase. This is an instruction to the company that the SEC intends to commence legal action against it. It’s like a final warning – get your house in order or we will throw the book at you.  The problem is Coinbase’s forthcoming crypto lending program, known as Lend. The SEC says it is an unregistered securities offering. Coinbase’s executives argue that securities laws devised nearly a century ago shouldn’t apply to crypto products that no one could have even imagined back then. But the principles underlying the 1933 and 1934 Securities Acts were designed to catch products that hadn’t yet been invented. Is Coinbase’s product really so innovative that these laws should no longer apply?  Frances Coppola, a CoinDesk columnist, is a freelance writer and speaker on banking, finance and economics. Her book, “The Case for People’s Quantitative Easing,” explains how modern money creation and quantitative easing work, and advocates “helicopter money” to help economies out of recession.  Lend hasn’t been launched yet, but it’s open for pre-enrolment, and Coinbase has been avidly marketing it to its customers. This is how Coinbase’s pre-enrolment web site describes Lend:  We lend your USD Coin to verified borrowers, allowing you to earn 4% APY1 - over 8x the national average for high-yield savings accounts.  It then goes on to say that your principal is safe. But in a footnote it warns depositors that Coinbase is not a bank, the deposits are not high-yield savings accounts and there is no deposit insurance. So the principal is not “safe” as it is in an insured savings account. It is fully at risk. To be sure, the high interest rate compensates you for the risk of loss – but the marketing is more than slightly misleading.  Lend pays you interest for lending out your funds to “verified borrowers.” But there’s no direct connection between the loans to these borrowers and the interest rate you receive. You won’t even know who these borrowers are. So this isn’t peer-to-peer lending.  More likely, your funds will be placed into a pool of deposits, from which Coinbase will lend to its chosen borrowers. Coinbase will pay all depositors the same fixed interest rate. It will pocket any difference between the interest it earns on lending and the interest it pays to depositors.  Read More: Why Nobody Wins in Coinbase vs. the SEC | Michael J. Casey  Borrowing at a fixed rate, lending at a higher (possibly variable) rate and pocketing the difference is the business model of a bank. But there is as yet no specific regulation for crypto banks. As previously noted, the Securities Acts are intended as the catch-all for bank-like services provided by non-banks. Coinbase has fallen foul of the SEC because it wants to do bank-style deposit-taking and lending using cryptocurrency.  It’s not the first crypto lender to run into serious trouble for trying to act like a bank. BlockFi was recently issued with cease and desist orders by several U.S. states for operating an unregistered securities offering. This is how the State of New Jersey’s cease and desist order describes BlockFi’s scheme:  Since March 4, 2019, BFI, through its affiliates BlockFi Lending, LLC (“BlockFi”) and BlockFi Trading, LLC (“Trading”) has been, at least in part, funding its lending operations and proprietary trading through the sale of unregistered securities in the form of cryptocurrency interest-earning accounts. BlockFi refers to these unregistered securities as its “Crypto Interest Account” or the “BlockFi Interest Account” (the “BIAs”).  BlockFi allows investors to purchase the BIAs by depositing certain eligible cryptocurrencies into accounts at BlockFi. BlockFi then pools these cryptocurrencies together to fund its lending operations and proprietary trading. In exchange for investing in the BIAs, investors are promised an attractive interest rate that is paid monthly in cryptocurrency.  Under the 1933 Securities Act, “investment contracts” are deemed securities. Issuers of investment contracts must register with the SEC and comply with disclosure requirements. But “investment contract” is a very broad definition. In the Howey case of 1946, the Supreme Court established criteria for determining whether a product is an investment contract and therefore should be subject to securities regulation. The product must constitute:  An investment of money  In a common enterprise  With the expectation of profit  To be derived from the efforts of others  The product must meet all four of these criteria to be deemed a security.  New Jersey’s cease and desist order says that BlockFi’s crypto lending scheme meets all four criteria: Depositors are investing money in the form of cryptocurrency; their deposits are pooled, so are in a “common enterprise”; they expect to receive interest on their deposits and the interest is earned by BlockFi lending their funds out to others.  The description of BlockFi’s product in New Jersey’s cease and desist order is remarkably similar to the way Lend appears to work. So if BlockFi’s BIAs meet the Howey criteria, it is likely Coinbase’s Lend deposits do too. It is now clear that this is the SEC’s view.  It would surely have been sensible for Coinbase to pause its plans to launch what looks like a carbon copy of BlockFi’s product. And Coinbase certainly should have pulled the product when the SEC indicated that it intended to regard it as an unregistered securities offering. But instead, it opted for defiance.  For a publicly listed company with millions of customers to defy securities laws in plain sight is wholly unacceptable. No wonder the SEC issued a Wells notice. And no wonder it refused to explain to Coinbase’s executives why it was throwing the book at it. In the SEC’s eyes, such a company is perfectly capable of understanding and complying with the law.  Coinbase’s executive team nevertheless pleaded innocence. In a trenchant blog post, Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s chief legal officer, reiterated his view that Lend was not an investment contract and lambasted the SEC for failing to explain its reasoning. And on Twitter, Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong asked how lending could be considered a security. This turned out to be a rather foolish question. In response, the investor John Hempton sent Armstrong a screen image of the front page of the 1933 Securities Act. And in a (perhaps unintentional) exhibition of gold standard trolling, the SEC tweeted a 30-second video explaining “what bonds are and how they work.” Bonds are, of course, securitized lending.  But Armstrong and Grewal have a point. What Coinbase is really offering is bank-like deposit-taking and lending, but in USDC instead of U.S. dollars. No-one says U.S. dollar bank deposits are securities, so why should USDC deposits be considered securities?  The answer is, once again, in New Jersey’s cease and desist order against BlockFi:  The BIAs are not protected by Securities Investor Protection Corporation (the “SIPC”) or insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”). The BIAs are subject to additional risk, compared to assets held at SIPC member broker-dealers, or assets held at banks and savings associations, almost all of which carry FDIC insurance. Nor are they registered with the Bureau or any other securities regulatory authority, or exempt from registration.  Coinbase is offering bank-like services but is not subject to bank regulation – indeed, there is at present no “bank regulation” for crypto deposit-taking and lending. USDC deposits in its Lend scheme are not protected by FDIC insurance. And since Coinbase has not registered with the SEC as a securities broker-dealer, its deposits are not protected by SIPC insurance either. It is marketing Lend as a safe alternative to high-yielding savings accounts, when in reality Lend is considerably riskier than savings accounts or regulated securities investments. That’s why the SEC is throwing the book at it.  Read More: Why Bitcoin Could Be Good for El Salvador | Frances Coppola  Grewal argues that the Securities Acts are far too old to apply to crypto products. But this is, I fear, to misunderstand the nature of the Acts. Although the 1933 Act includes a comprehensive (for its time) list of financial products, the products are not the point. The Acts aim to ensure that lending and investment products offered by non-banks are regulated to protect those investing in them. Coinbase’s Lend product solicits deposits with promises of attractive returns and uses those deposits to fund risky lending. That’s exactly the sort of activity that the Securities Acts were intended to catch.  The business model of banking is eternal. Whenever you see something borrowing at interest, lending at higher interest, and pocketing the difference, it is doing banking, whether or not it is covered by existing bank regulations. And although unregulated banks can survive for a while, regulators eventually catch up with them. Crypto lenders are merely the latest type of unregulated bank. The SEC is currently catching up with them. Banking regulators will follow.  Eventually, crypto lenders will be subject to bank-like regulation specifically designed for them, and have their own version of FDIC insurance. Today’s unregulated crypto lenders will become tomorrow’s regulated banks.

The consumer price index rose 5.3% over the past 12 months, below economists’ average prediction of a 5.4% increase. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.1% last month, lower than economists’ expectation of 0.3% growth and the slowest increase the U.S. has seen in six months.  Bitcoin’s price rose $690, or 1.5%, to $46,501 since the CPI report was published at 8:30 a.m. ET (12:30 UTC).  The soft inflation report may encourage the U.S. central bank to keep its stimulus program, known as “quantitative easing,” or QE, longer than expected. Many cryptocurrency investors speculate that QE could weaken the dollar, pushing up the value of bitcoin, which has a capped supply. Bitcoin is also still seen on Wall Street as a speculative asset, and the bet is that more investors will be forced to seek such investments as QE suppresses returns in traditional bond markets.  While August’s lower-than-expected numbers may be regarded as a positive sign for transitory inflation, they could also be a sign of increasing macroeconomic uncertainty as COVID-19 variants fill hospitals even in highly vaccinated countries. Airline fares fell dramatically, and decreasing hotel prices weighed on the shelter index.  ”At the margin, the recent data will dampen some of the more excitable inflation forecasts in the markets and at the Fed,” Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for the forecasting firm Pantheon, wrote to clients in an email.  On a month-over-month basis:  Used-vehicles prices declined by 1.5%, continuing July’s trend of supply-side inflation wearing off, when prices for used autos increased by only 0.2%.  Airline fares declined sharply by 9.1%, compared with July’s decrease of 0.1%.  Shelter rose 0.2%, compared with a 0.4% increase in July.

Read more: What Is Bitcoin’s Lightning Network?  Lightning integration will allow Paxful users to send bitcoin to other Lightning wallets or exchanges, the company stated. No special conversion will be required as Paxful users have a universal bitcoin balance which can be used for both Bitcoin and Lightning network transfers.

Mair, who will report to Chief Business Officer Lane Kasselman, will oversee the London-based company’s efforts to build relationships with policymakers and regulators both at the federal and state level and work internally to determine the policies for which it wants to advocate. He will initially head a four-person team.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Kasselman noted that Mair “has been well known in DC for having crypto expertise” and called him a boon to Blockchain.”  “We basically got one of the most experienced crypto lobbyists,” Kasselman added. “He already knows policy arguments. He knows (the) regulators who are involved in it.”  Mair spent eight years at The Smith-Free Group, a 26-year-old lobbying group that has offered advocacy and other services on a range of topics. As vice president at the firm, he advocated for fintech and financial services firms, among other clients, and produced Smith-Free’s weekly fintech newsletter.  Mair’s hiring is part of an ongoing effort to fill key positions as Blockchain.com looks to expand. In March, the company appointed Jim Messina, who was President Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign manager and White House deputy chief of staff, to its board. “We are at the very beginning of building our public policy team,” Kasselman said. “You’ll see us bring on additional talent, not just in DC but also in the major states.”  The company raised $420 million in venture funding over two separate rounds earlier this year, the latter $300 million tranche at a valuation of $5.2 billion. The company said that it has created 76 million digital wallets, and over the past year, had seen a threefold increase in active users. “In DC, there’s an old saying that if you don’t have a seat at the table, you’re on the menu,” Kasselman said. “So it’s critical that companies like ours have a seat.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/14/blockchaincom-hires-washington-insider-as-head-of-us-public-policy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/838e6b5c37e8df886346945d27a0730a2e405ed8-1500x853.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Laos is also looking to draft regulations on cryptocurrencies, according to the report, which cited a government notice.

The six companies receiving authorization to mine are: Wap Data Technology Laos, Phongsubthavy Road & Bridge Construction, Sisaket Construction, Boupha Road-Bridge Design Survey, Joint Development Bank and Phousy Group.  The crypto mining exodus from China has created opportunity in the sector for other countries in Asia and beyond.  The southeast Asian country issued a notice that banned crypto in 2018 and reiterated its stance in August.  Laos is one of the smallest and poorest countries in the region, with a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of $2,630 as of 2020, according to the World Bank. That compares with more than $10,500 for China.  But the country is trying to become the “Battery of Southeast Asia” by building dozens of hydroelectric dams on the Mekong River.

The company is offering 7.5 million ADSs, each representing 10 shares of the company’s common stock.  In its prospectus filed with the SEC on Sept. 14, Argo said it was assuming an initial offering price of $18.40 per ADS based on its last reported sale price of ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange on Sept. 10. But it said the actual IPO price would be be determined by the company and its underwriters at the time of pricing.  Argo shares rose as much as 9.5% in early London trading to £1.43 ($1.98).  The London-based company announced the sale last month, and has applied for the ADSs to trade under the ticker “ARBK.”  In March, Argo acquired the New York firm DPN LLC, bringing it ownership of a chunk of land in West Texas for the construction of a new cryptocurrency mining facility, and it has been raising funds in recent months.  In June, it secured a £14 million (US$19 million) loan from Galaxy Digital, which last week lent it another £18 million (US$25 million).

The Bundesbank president said that a digital euro risks overly extending the role of central banking, Reuters reported Tuesday.  “A gradual approach might make sense given the risks involved – that means a digital euro with a specific set of features and the option to add further functionalities later,” Weidmann said at a conference.  He highlighted the risk that in times of crisis consumers would hold all their money with the central bank. That could cut off funding for commercial banks and inhibit their ability to lend.  A European central bank digital currency (CBDC) is in the early stages of development. The European Central Bank approved 24-month investigation phase in July.  Weidmann was restating warnings he has made previously around the implications of a CBDC on the eurozone’s banking system.

Zip said it will be developing a number of features based on crypto and buy-now-pay- later (BNPL) plans – the company’s bread-and-butter business model that allows customers to pay for goods in installments.  Crypto features will initially be rolled out in the U.S., with plans to expand more “broadly” in the future. Zip is among the first BNPL firms to offer crypto services to its customers.  Last month, Jack Dorsey’s payments company Square purchased Zip rival AfterPay in a bid to integrate AfterPay into Square’s existing Seller and Cash App business units.  Zip will also allow its U.S. merchants to accept bitcoin as payment for goods and services while allowing customers to convert cash rewards into bitcoin on their purchases through the use of its “BitcoinBack” feature in 2022.  Trading in crypto through the use of a native digital wallet developed by the pay-later firm was one of the most sought-after product features from users, according to Gray.  Speaking during a Retail Investor Day presentation on Tuesday, Brad Lindenberg, co-founder of Zip’s U.S. subsidiary, said crypto was a “revolution” his company “had to be a part of.”  Research previously undertaken by the company and presented Tuesday showed BNPL customers were 67% more likely to trade in cryptocurrency than non-BNPL customers.  “The innovation of crypto today feels like the internet did in 1995,” Lindenberg said. “The distributed ledger is one of the most powerful concepts in fintech.”  Lindenberg also said Zip’s approach was to ensure its crypto offerings would comply with regulations, including those in the U.S. and Australia, while maintaining easy-to-use crypto functionality.  “We don’t know exactly where this is going to land,” Lindenberg said. “However, every day it becomes more clear that we need to be part of this movement.”  Read more: Australia-Listed Non-Bank Broker SelfWealth to Add Crypto to Its Platform",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | WALLET,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/14/australias-zip-co-unveils-crypto-roadmap-during-retail-investor-day,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/228d23a4aab59329cc5c1385e9d7a2d12f42e7ab-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Now, you can buy a piece of virtual paradise too. First, some context: The Hawaiian islands have a long history as vacation getaways for well-off Americans. In recent years, that&apos;s changed. The price of real estate on the islands has skyrocketed as vacationers struggle to afford the high costs of accommodations and activities. Not to mention, interest in traveling is way down in a post-COVID world. NFT-based virtual real estate ownership has the potential to bring this paradise back to the masses. The concept is simple: Buy virtual real estate assets on a blockchain, and hold them as your one-of-a-kind virtual property, or re-sell them. All this is made possible by Next Earth, the project that&apos;s put a digital replica of Earth on the blockchain. The Opportunity Virtual real estate ownership offers metaverse enthusiasts the opportunity to have a piece of virtual land that can be used for building houses, parks, casinos, hotels, and other structures. These plots of land are called &apos;tiles&apos; and they&apos;re sold as 10×10 square meter parcels. That&apos;s different from buying a plot of land in Hawaii or another popular vacation spot where you&apos;d need to buy an entire acreage.

Here’s New Info","A couple of weeks ago, a hacker with a heart of gold sold a fake Banksy NFT for 100 ETH and then gave the money back. They advertised the auction through Banksy&apos;s official site. If the NFT was fake, someone hacked that site. Which seemed unlikely. Also, there is the issue of the alias that the scammed NFT collector uses. Pranksy, a play on words referencing the elusive graffiti artist Banksy mixed with the word &apos;prank.&apos; Which is what this whole situation is. Too many coincidences. Suspicious, we posed our theory: &apos;Was Pranksy targeted by Banksy and his team? If Banksy wanted to create worldwide headlines and comment on the NFT boom at the same time, a notorious art collector was the missing ingredient. Pransky&apos;s prominence in the NFT community mixed with his name makes him an ideal target.&apos; It seemed to fit, but the case of the fake Banksy NFT never ceases to amaze. Security Experts Warned Banksy About His Website&apos;s Vulnerability Luckily for us, the BBC is on the case.

42412027,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otcEmv,1631581087,Consulting Firm EY to Work With Polygon on Ethereum Scaling,"Big Four consulting firm Ernst & Young (EY) will use Polygon’s protocol and framework to deploy its own EY blockchain products on the Ethereum blockchain.  EY will adopt Polygon’s scaling products to allow it to boost transaction volumes and to provide “predictable costs” and settlement for business customers, according to a press release on Monday,  EY will also have an option to move transactions onto the public Ethereum network, the company said.  Polygon’s “commit chain” – another term for a blockchain scaling product – has been retrofitted by EY to create permissioned, private industry chains that take advantage of new models used to verify transactions.  “The EY commitment to the public Ethereum ecosystem and to open standards was a big driver in evolving shared approaches,” Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal said.  The Ethereum blockchain has long been plagued by congestions and high fees associated with transactions on its network. The London hard fork last month was an attempt to fix that but has shown mixed results in reducing costs so far.  Scaling products have been praised for their ability to lighten the network load from major blockchains, including Bitcoin, because of their ability to process transactions on a sidechain. Arbitrum, for example, has seen significant growth in the past week rising from $24.5 million in “total value locked” at the start of this month to about $2.2 billion on Monday.  EY said its move increases efficiency and reduces transaction costs by providing an optimistic rollup. The company also said its new “industry chains” would provide customers with the security of a closed system while retaining a close relationship with the public Ethereum mainnet.  “Working with Polygon provides EY teams with a powerful set of tools to scale transactions for clients and offers a faster road map to integration on the public Ethereum mainnet,” said Paul Brody, EY’s global blockchain leader in the announcement. “We discovered our shared priorities around open system and networks and the Ethereum ecosystem would make collaboration in this area much easier.”  Read more: Valid Points: OpenSea, Arbitrum and Layer 1 Wars",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | SPONSORED | FORKS,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/14/consulting-firm-ey-to-work-with-polygon-on-ethereum-scaling,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3d4acfde0b205a9aad03f129fea598eb10044fa6-1440x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
