42382368,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rSel,1563837107,Tron Founder Justin Sun Postpones Lunch With Warren Buffett,"UPDATE (July 23, 18:19 UTC): In a Periscope video broadcast live Tuesday afternoon, Justin Sun appeared to be in San Francisco (with the Bay Bridge in the background), and not in China, as news outlet Caixin reported earlier.  UPDATE (July 23, 2019, 16:50 UTC): Chinese business news organization Caixin reported Tuesday that Justin Sun is under Chinese government control, meaning he is not allowed to leave the country pending an investigation. He is not facing formal charges at this time.  A local internet finance risks regulator has also recommended that police form a case against Sun.      Justin Sun's hotly-anticipated lunch with billionaire investor Warren Buffett has been postponed, the Tron Foundation announced Monday.  Sun has fallen ill with kidney stones, the foundation said on Twitter. The parties have ""agreed to reschedule at a later date.""  The lunch, scheduled for July 25, was the prize for winning a charity auction. Sun bid $4.6 million earlier this year and seemingly intended to introduce the notoriously crypto-skeptical Buffett to a number of influential figures in the space.  As of Monday, Sun had lined up Circle's Jeremy Allaire, Huobi's Chris Lee, eToro's Yoni Assia and litecoin creator Charlie Lee to join him.  The specific subjects to be discussed during the steak meal were not disclosed; however, Buffett has famously called bitcoin ""rat poison squared,"" and made a number of other unflattering remarks about cryptocurrencies.  Sun, himself a controversial figure, is the creator of the Tron cryptocurrency and head of its namesake foundation. He convinced Buffett to move the charity lunch from its traditional New York location to Silicon Valley.

42382362,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rSVx,1563833456,Bitfinex: 'New York Customers' Cited by NYAG Are Foreign Entities,"Arguments that Bitfinex and Tether served New York residents through 2018 are misleading, new legal filings by the companies claim.  A new affirmation  by Bitfinex and Tether general counsel Stuart Hoegner says a previous filing by the New York Attorney General's office claiming that Empire State residents used the companies' platforms for far longer than previously stated ""contain a number of inaccurate and misleading assertions.""  According to Hoegner, some documents presented as evidence by the NYAG which appear to outline how New York residents could trade on Bitfinex ""make clear that we would only do business with a foreign entity having no presence in New York,"" while other documents describing Bitfinex customers based out of New York were actually about ""foreign ECPs [eligible contract participants].""  These foreign ECPs, according to Hoegner, include former Fortress partner Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital, which has an address listed in New York City.  Other traders listed as being New York residents were also nonetheless ""foreign ECPs,"" Hoegner claims.  Moreover, Bitfinex ceased serving New York residents in January 2017 and all U.S. residents in August that same year, Hoegner claims. He added that all U.S.-based entities and corporate customers were banned a year later.  Other arguments  A separate filing by Bitfinex and Tether's attorneys  argues that the New York Supreme Court should dismiss the case because the NYAG's office did not serve papers to Bitfinex, Tether, or the other affiliated companies in time according to law; the companies ""have not purposefully availed themselves of doing business in New York""; USDT is not a security or commodity as defined by the state's Martin Act; and the law the NYAG's office is citing does not apply.  The filing also argues that the NYAG is wrong to claim jurisdiction on the grounds that New York residents may have utilized Bitfinex's platform through the summer of 2018, since this period ends well before the exchange first lost access to its funds in October 2018, which is the main issue the NYAG's office is purportedly looking into.  The case began in April 2019, when the NYAG's office filed a complaint against Bitfinex, Tether and other affiliated companies, claiming that Bitfinex covered up the loss of $850 million by borrowing from Tether's reserve.  Tether, issuer of the ostensibly dollar-backed stablecoin USDT, extended a $900 million line of credit to Bitfinex, though the crypto exchange did not borrow the full sum before a judge issued a temporary injunction freezing the movement of funds from the stablecoin issuer.  Attorneys for Bitfinex and Tether claim that the decision to extend the line of credit was made independently, although the companies share executives and owners.  Monday's documents are aimed at supporting Bitfinex and Tether's motion to dismiss the NYAG's case. The parties are due back in court on July 29.

42382366,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rSaz,1563827413,Daimler to Produce Crypto Hard Wallet for Automotive Industry,"Mercedes Benz parent company Daimler has partnered with blockchain firm Riddle & Code to produce a hardware wallet for automobiles.  Long term, the business alliance looks to provide solutions for self-driving vehicles and car-sharing platforms, relay traffic patterns in real-time, mesh with smart city infrastructure, and transfer accident information to the proper authorities and insurance providers.  The wallet, a tamper-resistant piece of hardware that was presented at Startupautobahn in Stuttgart, creates a cryptographic identity for vehicles. It also integrates with the vehicle's telematic control unit (TCU) to receive, sign, and attest to sensory data from the car and surrounding infrastructure.  This information can be used to record a vehicle’s performance and ensure it received proper maintenance. The wallet can be integrated into the hardware of trucks, luxury cars, and buses “to make car rental and fleet management more efficient,” said Ben Schwarz, Riddle & Code head of communications.  Schwarz said the pricing model hasn’t been finalized, but will be based on hardware costs and involve a license model for fleet owners who deploy the wallet. A transaction-based model is also under discussion.  “However, once vehicles become autonomous parties to a blockchain transactions, the marketplace is boundless,” he added.  Because the wallet syncs a vehicle with its surrounding environment, transactions can be made with any digitally communicative technology including toll booths, parking spaces, and mechanics. However, ""the genuinely disruptive new marketplaces will come from data.""  The technology may also one day pay remittances to insurance providers. In fact, Schwarz went as far as saying insurers or regulators may even “mandate these technologies,” to keep automative data secure like an airplane’s blackbox.  “Knowing which parameters were active at the time of an accident can help provide a trustworthy solution to understanding its cause,” the company said.

42382369,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rSdV,1563823243,Iran Legalizes Crypto Mining,"Iran is officially recognizing cryptocurrency mining as an industry within its borders.  According to the Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture, a government economic commission approved crypto mining on Sunday, with the government now looking for ways to regulate this activity within its existing legal structure.  ""A mechanism to mine digital coins was approved by the government’s economic commission and will later be put to discussion at a cabinet meeting,"" Central Bank of Iran governor Abdolnaser Hemmati said in a statement.  Similarly, deputy minister energy for electricity and energy Homayun Haeri said government ministers will vote on a measure to approve an electricity rate for mining farms.  The Iranian government has been vacillating on whether to approve of mining as an industry or not. Last month, two mining farms were seized and shut down by authorities.  Haeri has also been quoted in the past as saying that the government should not subsidize crypto mining efforts  However, the region has long been attractive to miners due to cheap electricity rates available.  Crypto usage  While crypto mining appears to have been given a tentative green light in Iran, it is unclear whether officials are changing their stance on using cryptocurrencies for domestic payments, and if so, how.  The central bank recommended barring crypto usage for domestic payments at the end of January, though local industry stakeholders are pushing back against such a ban.  Two Iranian nationals remain the only individuals to be placed onto the U.S. State Department Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC)'s sanctions list for bitcoin activities specifically.  Last year, OFAC sanctioned Ali Khorashadizadeh and Mohammad Ghorbaniyan for their alleged roles in facilitating payments for the SamSam ransomware.  While Ghorbaniyan admits to facilitating these payments, he claims he was not aware of the funds' origins.

The firm is in the pre-registration phase and will accept domain applications until August 10.  Similar to the domain name system (DNS) currently in play on the web, ENS will link to alphanumeric ethereum addresses through “human-readable” names, according to a statement. These domains appear like traditional URLs, are searchable on any web browser, and will link to ethereum web pages that exist either on or off the blockchain.  This additional layer of web identity will enable people to associate their brands, companies, or persons with ethereum accounts.  The announcement also acts as a call to action for pre-existing brands to stake their claim before domain-name squatters take valuable internet real-estate like apple.eth or ibm.eth.  The company writes in a statement:  “Blockchain domain names are not regulated like .com or .org domain names… The implication that Encirca wishes to convey is brand owners should act defensively to protect their trademarks in the .eth top-level domain.”  The firm said that short names, between 3 and 6 characters, will be reserved for brands that can show the longest continuous use of a particular URL on a pre-existing domain like .com or .org. While addresses starting at 7 characters or more will be auctioned off.  The company did not respond to a request for comment.  Encirca is a participant in the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, a non-profit that coordinates domain name listings, and has received a SOC-2 rating for privacy and security standards.

Circle announced Monday it received a full Digital Assets Business Act license in Bermuda for its crypto exchange Poloniex. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire told CoinDesk that 70 percent of Poloniex users hail from beyond the U.S. and the new Bermuda-based entity will handle those accounts from now on. In May, the company geofenced some assets on Poloniex from U.S. customers.  “Europe and Asia are both pretty significant markets for us in particular,” he said, adding the USDC stablecoin is particularly popular with institutional Asian investors. “The lack of regulatory frameworks significantly limits what can be offered to individuals and businesses in the U.S.”  Circle laid off around 30 employees earlier this year to “ensure our costs were in line with the market,” Allaire said. The cuts were attributed in part regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. Circle now says it plans to hire around the same number of people over the next 24 months, perhaps with different roles, to focus on global markets.  “The project to establish a new international operations hub for our market, exchange and wallet services, was a major project,” Allaire told CoinDesk, adding:  “It took a long time working with the Bermuda government and the Bermuda Monetary Authority.”  Looking forward, Allaire said more diverse assets will be available to global customers and that Poloniex might also expand to financial services, which the startup previously couldn’t offer in the U.S. He declined to specify what types of products and services those might entail. However, he did say users can expect to see more “yield-generating crypto accounts,” similar to the staking services already available for Cosmos and Stellar.

42382370,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rSg1,1563808503,Bakkt Is Scheduled to Start Testing Its Bitcoin Futures Contracts Today,"UPDATE (July 22, 2019, 19:35 UTC): Bakkt tweeted Monday afternoon that ""Testing is proceeding as planned with participants from around the world,"" with user acceptance testing including both its daily and its monthly contracts.      Bitcoin futures platform Bakkt is scheduled to begin testing its new contracts Monday.  Nearly a year since revealing its ambitious vision, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) is still waiting on regulatory approvals to take the platform live. Still, despite having to delay its new market multiple times, the parent of the New York Stock Exchange is moving forward with plans to offer potentially the first physically-settled bitcoin futures in the U.S.  Bakkt announced in May that it would begin testing its bitcoin futures contracts in July, later firming up a July 22 test date.  It will apparently be testing two different types of contracts Monday: a daily and a monthly contract. Bakkt aims to list the futures, which would be traded through ICE Futures U.S. and cleared through ICE Clear U.S., the parent company's clearinghouse.  It is unclear what specifically will be involved in the testing process. Bakkt did not reply to multiple requests for comment.  The company plans to offer U.S. traders access to physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts, which differ from the cash-settled futures contracts that Chicago exchanges CME and Cboe offered starting at the end of 2017. With cash-settled contracts, traders receive the cash equivalent to the contract's value when it expires, while with a physically-settled contract they receive the actual underlying commodity – in this case, bitcoin.  Bakkt hopes to draw fresh institutional funding to the bitcoin ecosystem with its regulated product, which may attract investors wary of the broader market.  Launch delays  Bakkt initially announced a December 2018 launch date, before delaying to January 2019. The company announced another, indefinite delay later as it continued working with regulators to secure the necessary approvals to launch.  While Bakkt was initially said to have asked the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to approve its new product, Bakkt announced in May that it had filed to self-certify the contracts instead.  Under a self-certification process, a company essentially verifies for the CFTC that its futures contracts fulfill all legal requirements. The CFTC can review this certification, but unless there are any legal or regulatory violations, it cannot stop the product from moving forward.  While Bakkt has self-certified its contracts, it cannot launch the product until it secures a trust company charter through the New York Department of Financial Services. It is unclear if Bakkt has also applied for one of New York's signature BitLicenses.  Bakkt isn't alone in trying to launch the first physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts in the U.S.: LedgerX and ErisX have both recently received CFTC approvals to offer their own such product. Neither company has yet announced a firm timeline for when they might launch.  Separately, Seed CX wants to launch forwards contracts, though it is waiting on regulatory approval.

In an announcement on Monday, MediConnect – a firm that has built a solution to track and manage prescription meds using blockchain –said it has received ""indicative"" support from the Ugandan government to explore the use of its product in the country.  The news comes after the company met with the president of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, as well as its Minister of Health, Dr Jane Ruth Aceng, and other government officials to discuss the benefits of a blockchain solution.  As well as pledging support for MediConnect’s solution in tackling the spread of fake drugs in Uganda, the government said it would be open to working with MediConnect on the issue, according to the press release.  MediConnect CEO Dexter Blackstock said:  “The Ugandan President, Minister of Health and National Drug Authority all understand the need to act fast to tackle the country’s counterfeit drug problem and recognise the benefits offered by tracing medication on the secure, scalable blockchain framework we are developing. We see this as an important opportunity for MediConnect to form part of Uganda’s national infrastructure and protect its citizens by ensuring all drugs in circulation are authentic and safe.”  The firm cited data from the Ugandan National Drug Authority as indicating that 10 percent of drugs prescribed in the country have below par or counterfeit copies sold on the market. The World Health Organization has also found that 10 percent of medical products in developing countries, many of which are in Africa, are substandard or fake.  At the meeting with government was also Uebert Angel, a founder of a Pentecostal ministry in the U.K. and strategic partner of MediConnect.  He said in the announcement:  ""Travelling to Uganda, I was shocked by the extent to which counterfeit drugs have ruined the lives of the most vulnerable people in society. It is therefore humbling to be able to make a difference by investing in the country’s pharmaceutical sector and partnering with MediConnect to identify fake dugs and prevent them from reaching end-users.

42382376,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rSop,1563800416,A New Platform Called AFOX Will Tokenize Media Buying Contracts,"Parsec, an advertising firm, has unveiled a pilot program for offering options and futures trades and settling digital advertising contracts on R3’s Corda blockchain.  MediaCom, a buyer of digital advertising contracts, and Future US – the company behind ten trade publications such as PC Accelerator, Guitar World, and TechRadar – are the first participants on the platform. The companies have announced the first futures contract traded without Parsec's third party mediation.  The Advertising Futures and Options Exchange (AFOX) platform utilizes a guaranteed quality metric, measured at one-second of full attention per advertisement, and encodes these ""impressions"" on the blockchain.  “Current media contracts don’t enforce quality standards, so buyers demand favorable cancellation terms,” Parsec representatives said in a statement. “Since contracts are cancellable, a publisher’s business is unpredictable.""  Charlie Fiordalis, managing partner of MediaCom, noted that media contracts that take weeks to write and months to reconcile can be cancelled within 24 hours of payment. “You get what you pay for,” he said.  Parsec aims to reduce contract cancellation by enabling buyers to track who saw an advertisement, “see where it ran, and how it was optimized by viewer variables,” said Fiordalis, thereby eliminating the need to have an “out” from an unfulfilled contract.  Fiordalis said that currently the best media asset is a Superbowl ad, which gains massive reach in just 30-seconds, though Parsec’s guarantee to supply one second of full attention per advertisement has an “absolute quality to them,"" because they are non-cancellable.  These “discretely defined” contracts behave as a currency, Fiordalis said, adding, “one second of attention is an easily tokenized asset.""  In fact, AFOX plans to tokenize these blockchain-supported media contracts and make them available on a secondary market as media futures and options. Futures contracts enable companies to hedge against their price inputs and potentially buy advertisements in advance at a 40 to 50 percent discount.  The second order effects of contract financialization may increase market liquidity, as media companies can bet against their guaranteed advertising revenues.  Parsec Media CEO Marc Guldimann said the next step would be to enable more publishers to sell contracts directly to media buyers, without the intervention of middlemen like his firm, and develop additional financial instruments based on a tokenized unit of advertising impressions.

Speaking to Financial News, Damian Collins, chair of the House of Commons’ Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said, given the company's past poor record on privacy, he has concerns that Facebook can adequately protect the financial details of its billions of potential Libra users.  Collins, who led a British investigation into Cambridge Analytica data scandal, said that, with Libra, Facebook appears to be ""almost trying to turn itself into its own country.” While not a nation with borders, Facebook ""has a global community who are solely under the oversight of Mark Zuckerberg.""  Collins said:  “If we’re going to have this payment system created by Facebook that exists within a Facebook walled garden, which no one really has access to or can question, then our concern has got to be that this system is going to be open to massive fraud.”  Addressing such concerns prior to Senate hearings in the U.S., Facebook's David Marcus said earlier this month, ""You won’t have to trust Facebook to get the benefit of Libra.”  He continued:  “And Facebook won’t have any special responsibility over the Libra Network. But we hope that people will respond favorably to [Libra's] Calibra wallet. We’ve been clear about our approach to financial data separation and we will live up to our commitments and work hard to deliver real utility.”  However, regulators the world over have called for more information on the project and said Libra must be regulated if it is to move forward.  The G7 specifically addressed Facebook's stablecoin in its France meeting last week, warning afterwards that cryptocurrencies like Libra are a threat to global financial stability and would require rules of the “highest” standards to minimize the risk of its use in money laundering and terrorism funding.  The Bank of England's governor, Mark Carney, made similar comments in June, though added he was “open minded” on the utility of Libra.

42382381,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rStr,1563793226,Bitcoin Price Ends Longest Losing Streak Since December,"View  Bitcoin logged gains in the three days to July 20, snapping the longest losing streak on the three-day chart since December.  The bias, however, is still bearish with prices holding below $11,080 (as per Bitstamp).  Key indicators on short-duration charts are biased for a fall back below $10,000.  A 4-hour close above $11,080 would activate twin bullish cues and could yield a rally to $12,000.  A weekly close (Sunday, UTC) or consecutive daily close above $12,000 is needed to confirm a continuation of the bull market.      Bitcoin (BTC) ended its longest losing streak in seven months over the weekend, but the outlook still remains bearish.  The top cryptocurrency by market capitalization eked out 10.83 percent gains in the three days to July 20, confirming a green candle on the three-day chart.  The green candle notably formed following three consecutive red candles, representing bitcoin's longest losing streak since the end of December, according to Bitstamp data.  Back then, BTC had created four straight read candles, as seen in the chart below.  Losing streak snapped  As seen above, bitcoin's recovery rally from the bear market low of $3,122 on Dec. 15 ended with a four-candle losing streak, which saw prices create a bearish lower high at $4,236 and drop by 15 percent to $3,560.  The resistance created at $4,236 remained intact for more than three months before bitcoin breached that on the back of higher volumes on April 2, confirming a long term bearish-to-bullish trend change.  What followed was a solid rise to $13,880 by June 24. Essentially, BTC more than tripled in value in six months to June 24 and was looking overbought at the start of the current month.  Therefore, the latest three-candle losing streak likely marked a healthy correction of the bull market, as noted by popular technical and fundamental analyst Alex Kruger.  While the losing trend has ended, the correction phase may not be over yet, as the cryptocurrency is yet to violate the bearish lower-highs pattern with a move above $11,080, as noted on Friday.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $10,460 on Bitstamp – down 1.47 percent on a 24-hour basis.  4-hour chart  Bitcoin clocked a high of $11,120 on Saturday, but failed to close above $11,080 and fell back to $10,300, leaving intact the bearish lower highs pattern created during the sell-off from $13,200 to $9,049.  The moving average convergence divergence histogram has crossed below zero, signaling a bullish-to-bearish trend change, meaning the bounce from the July 17 low of $9,049 has ended and prices may fall back below $10,000 over the next 24 hours.  Supporting the bearish case is the below 50-print on the relative strength index.  Bitcoin, however, may rise to $12,000 this week if prices break above $11,080, activating twin bullish cues: invalidation of lower highs and an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout (above right).  The neckline resistance of a potential inverse head-and-shoulders pattern is currently located at $11,130.  Weekly chart  On the weekly chart, $12,000 is the level to beat for the bulls.  A convincing weekly close on Sunday (UTC), or a back-to-back daily close above $12,000 would invalidate the buyer exhaustion signaled by bitcoin's repeated failure to hold onto gains above that level, as shown by candles with long upper wicks (see arrows).  That, however, looks unlikely, with the 14-week RSI rolling over from the overbought territory (above 70) and the MACD histogram losing altitude, a sign of weakening bullish momentum.  Also, on the three-day chart, the MACD has turned bearish for the first time since December.  All-in-all, the odds of BTC falling below $10,000 in the next day or two are high. On the downside, key support is located at $9,097 (May 30 high).  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

The tweetstorm, posted on July 19, offered a complete rundown of the problems facing a modern crypto-banking solution. The biggest problem? He ran out of cash.  https://twitter.com/fairxio/status/1152310679577059328  ""Ultimately, our business model was simple: introduce a new, licensed, fully regulated national bank, modeled as a financial market utility, that would work with individuals and banks to create a dematerialized bank deposit, denominated in USD. The bank was Frank Financial,"" wrote the founder, former CTO of IBM Blockchain Financial Solutions Michael Dowling, apparently without irony.  Further, the Dowling noted that blockchain might not be the best solution for banking. He did, however, wish Facebook and Libra well in their effort to turn things around on the regulatory front. ""I really do wish Marcus and his team all the best of luck. I wish Marcus had chosen…ANYONE…other than FB to partner with. I wish he had tried this at PayPal, which has a reputation of actually following the rules to get things done. Pretty sure they will require a bank license,"" he wrote.  In the end, Dowling said he and his team needed some time to regroup.  https://twitter.com/fairxio/status/1152311349608796160  The company planned to run on the Stellar network, and was to become an ""anchor"" on Stellar that could take in fiat and crypto and convert them to tokens on the network, according to researcher Gitzalytics.  Dowling noted that neither VCs or crypto investors liked the company. First, he was unable to give preferred shares to early investors because of banking regulations and he also could not create a proper stablecoin without centralization, a bugbear to the crypto whales. In the end, Dowling said, it cost too much fiat to disrupt the banking industry with crypto.  The upside? Visitors to the FairX website are now treated to the tiniest of smiles:  Image via FairX.io.

42382375,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rSmJ,1563788458,FINRA Extends Deadline for Firms to Report Crypto Activity,"Amid the kerfuffle last week over Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency project and its potential regulation, the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) quietly extended its deadline for firms to report their crypto activity.  The self-regulatory body for brokerages and exchanges had last year requested (it says ""encouraged"") that member companies inform their regulatory coordinator if the firm or associated individuals or affiliates, ""engaged, or intended to engage, in activities related to digital assets."" The request included ""digital assets that are non-securities"" – that is, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.  With the deadline for that notice expiring on July 31, FINRA posted a follow up late last week, extending the deadline until the same date in 2020.  The new notice explains that:  ""As securities regulators continue to provide guidance to members regarding the unique regulatory challenges presented by digital assets – e.g., Joint Statement on Broker-Dealer Custody of Digital Asset Securities – FINRA believes it is important to keep the lines of communication with members open on this important topic.""  Activities that FINRA suggests should be reported include buying, selling and transacting in digital assets, ICOs, crypto derivatives or funds investing in digital assets. Among others, it also lists offering advisory services or pooled funds, offering trading or custody services, mining cryptocurrencies and accepting cryptocurrencies as payment.  Any use of blockchain technology is also worthy of reporting, the authority said.  Earlier this month, FINRA and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) jointly said there are a number of questions to be addressed before they can approve crypto companies’ applications to become broker-dealers.  One factor is whether the assets are treated as securities under the Securities Investor Protection Act (SIPA) of 1970.  “The ability of a broker-dealer to comply with aspects of the Customer Protection Rule is greatly facilitated by established laws and practices regarding the loss or theft of a security, that may not be available or effective in the case of certain digital assets,” a statement said.  Another issued is that, while a broker can prove that it possesses the private keys to a crypto wallet, it would be difficult to prove that no other entity does, according to the agencies.

42382380,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rSrL,1563768041,Libra's Biggest Problem,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      Among the barrage of commentary accompanying the Libra circus on Capitol Hill last week was a single short tweet from lawyer Marco Santori that summed up the core problem confronting Facebook’s cryptocurrency project – and, for that matter, any corporate-led effort of its kind.  Satoshi was following a Cypherpunk dream. He/she or they wanted to bring privacy to digital payments, to translate the offline experience of cash transactions into the online realm. The idea: that a user needn’t prove their identity to execute a transaction with anyone else on the Internet – just as there’s no need for me to show a document proving that I’m Michael Casey every time I hand over some dollar notes to someone.  This matters not because everyone using cash or bitcoin is a money launderer evading law enforcement, but because identification poses a real barrier to commerce. If society has an interest in identifying people – as financial law enforcement agents would argue – then we must recognize that this comes with an enormous trade-off in terms of foregone economic activity.  Privacy Matters    Think of the 2 billion “unbanked” adults from the world’s developing countries, the people that Libra, ostensibly, wants to serve. A lack of education, poor credit records, and untrustworthy state-issued ID papers means these people can’t qualify for accounts at local banks (primarily because those local banks are themselves compelled to comply with strict international “know your customer” procedures lest they are cut off by their foreign banking counterparts.) For a very large number of the world’s adults, identity is a very real barrier to commerce.    But you can also think of the billionaires that run Wall Street’s hedge funds or the giant banks and brokerages that trade on their behalf. None of those guys want their identities revealed when they place a buy or sell order for a stock, bond or commodity. The market will just trade against them.  Identity also limits fungibility. As I’ve argued before , money is most useful if its past is unknown. Any single dollar, or single bitcoin, must be worth the same as any other single dollar or bitcoin. But if I receive a dollar or bitcoin that might subsequently be subject to a legal or enforcement claim due to its involvement in a previous transaction, the uncertainty attached to it will, by definition, reduce its utility. This leads to a depletion of monetary fungibility. As to why that’s a problem, just ask anyone with an account at a brokerage or other entity whose assets have been frozen for some criminal or civil action over which they themselves had no involvement.  So, privacy matters. If we are to bring digital, borderless commerce to the widest possible user base and expand the global economy, we must strive for privacy.  Privacy Tech Meets Increased Surveillance    Sadly, bitcoin failed to achieve sufficient privacy, at least in its initial form. Why? Because its public ledger is, well, public.      When combined with the “know your customer” procedures of legally compliant crypto exchanges, its traceability means a user can relatively easily be connected to past transactions once they have been identified at any one of those on- and off-ramps.    This is the problem that led to the creation of cryptocurrencies with more robust privacy protections such as Zcash and Monero, along with the invention of bitcoin mixers and potential sidechain solutions for obscuring transaction trails such as Mimblewimble.  Indeed, it’s quite noteworthy that at the same time that regulators are expanding their purview over cryptocurrencies – see the Financial Action Task Force’s new disclosure rules – and demanding increasingly more user-identifying information, cryptocurrency developers are driving in the opposite direction: toward more privacy, more self-custody, more trustless exchange solutions, more user autonomy. They’re striving for the goal of electronic cash.  The Centralization-Decentralization Contradiction    Here’s the catch: if you’re not building on top of a fully decentralized, permissionless system though, it’s impossible to assure users of privacy. If the nodes maintaining the ledger are identified as belonging to a particular list of authorized validators – e.g. the Libra Association’s 28 members – authorities can, and will, demand the identity of users when they so desire or they’ll have transactions censored or reversed. They’ll do so to meet anti-money laundering or counter-terrorism objectives, or, more cynically, they’ll make such demands to simply assert control over the population (e.g. digital surveillance in China.)    Facebook’s David Marcus, as the identifiable representative of a U.S. incorporated company, had no option, of course, but to swear that Facebook’s Libra application, Calibra, would comply with KYC requirements and cooperate with anti-money laundering initiatives. It was a legal no-brainer. It didn’t matter much, though, because law enforcement agencies – with just a little bit of cross-border cooperation – will be able to hold him to his word by way of the Libra Association members themselves.  Therein lies the “don’t worry, we’re centralized” side of the bifurcated argument Santori alluded to. It’s the assurance that says “you know where to find me.”  The problem is that the American people – and, by extension, their lawmakers – are kind of schizophrenic on these matters. That’s because, quite rightly, privacy is also becoming an increasing concern with regards to tech companies’ data collection, and especially with Facebook. It was quite striking – satisfying, in fact – to see how many questions from lawmakers addressed these concerns, where they sought assurances that Calibra would not exploit people’s personal data.  In essence, Marcus’s response was: “don’t worry, we’re decentralized.” The idea was that the structure simply won’t permit any member to invade a user’s privacy.  So, it’s a contradiction, but one that, by definition, doesn’t arise within bitcoin or other decentralized cryptocurrencies, which can much more accurately say, “you don’t know where to find me.” (In fact, there is no “me” in such cases.)  What Do We Want?    In many respects, this contradiction is not a function of Facebook’s involvement in this project or Libra’s structure per se but of competing public interests. We can’t have our cake and eat it too. We can’t simultaneously insist on absolute privacy and the power to intervene in transactions to catch bad guys laundering money.    I believe the answer lies in a combination of technologies, system designs and a more creative approach to regulation that, unfortunately, doesn't exist yet.  Hope lies in tools such as zero-knowledge proofs and in emerging “self-sovereign” identity concepts, as well as in a more open-minded regulatory model for curtailing crime – one that doesn’t depend on revealing people’s personal identifying information.  But these are a ways off; they will require user adoption and; to a still large extent, belief in them by policymakers.  For now, then, David Marcus and his cohorts have no choice but to keep speaking out of both sides of their mouths.
