42398832,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbghCH,1447361638,Royal Bank of Canada Exploring Blockchain Loyalty Program,"Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) president and CEO Dave McKay called bitcoin's underlying distributed ledger a ""quantum innovation"" during a roundtable discussion today.  At the RBC Capital Markets conference in New York, McKay discussed RBC’s ongoing experimentations with the blockchain, stating that the bank may seek to launch a loyalty program that uses the technology sometime in 2016, American Banker reports.  In his remarks, McKay indicated he believes the bank’s experiments with the blockchain need to be introduced with ""caution"", echoing statements made by the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) commissioner earlier this week.  ""It is a brand-new technology, and what do we really know about it? How cyber-secure is it? We are going to learn a lot more about it,"" McCay said. ""Given what is at stake, it is not something you can rush to market with and fix as you go. You want it to work.""  According to American Banker, McKay suggested that RBC was currently looking for low-risk ways to introduce its customers to the technology, and that it felt a loyalty program was the best fit at this time.  He stated:  ""It would be a nice hybrid step. A loyalty account is a good, safe currency to start with.""  McCay was less interested in bitcoin’s use case as a digital currency, according to the report, noting that he doesn’t believe this application solves consumer problems.  Notably, RBC was one of 13 major banks that announced a partnership with distributed ledger startup R3CEV this September. R3 that has so far attracted 25 of the world's largest financial institutions.  As such, McKay stressed that a collaborative approach was perhaps the best way for the technology to reach mass market.  According to company estimates, RBC is the largest bank in Canada by assets and market capitalization, employing 78,000 workers and boasting $343bn in assets under management as of the end of 2014.

42398817,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbggzU,1447354305,"Four Winners Split 44,000 Bitcoins in Final Silk Road Auction","The US Marshals Service (USMS) has revealed that its fourth and final auction of confiscated Silk Road bitcoins resulted in four winners.  The public announcement adds certainty to the speculation surrounding the 5th November event, which saw 11 registered bidders compete for blocks totalling 44,000 BTC (valued at roughly $14.6m at press time).  So far, only one winner has made public their purchasing of auction blocks, with New York-based bitcoin exchange itBit confirming it successfully secured five blocks on behalf of a syndicate of clients and investors.  Figures provided by the USMS indicate that itBit’s total was surpassed by another unknown entity, which garnered more than 24,000 BTC (worth roughly $8.1m). Other, as yet unknown bidders, claimed smaller percentages of the total.  The agency said:  ""The latest U.S. Marshals Service Bitcoin auction resulted in four winning bidders. The breakdown of bitcoins won by bidder[s] is 4,000, 6,000, 10,000 and approximately 24,341 bitcoins.”  Blockchain analysis conducted by online observers had previously suggested that as many as three to four winners had secured bitcoins as part of the auction.

42398816,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbggyV,1447349407,Washington State Issues Bitcoin Warning Amid Price Volatility,"The Washington State Department of Financial Institutions has issued a new warning to potential buyers of digital currencies such as bitcoin.  The advisory  , entitled ""Beware the Next Big Investment"", offers a warning about investing in digital currencies, marijuana-related businesses and binary options.  It reads:  ""Digital currency value fluctuates wildly because it is decentralized and often the subject of 'breaking' news and rumors.""  The majority of the item focused on the risk of unrealistic investment pitches, including those that seek to intentionally misinform investors.  ""Since different countries and jurisdictions have little uniformity on how bitcoin and digital currency is regulated, scammers will take advantage of the confusion and contradictions to misinform potential investors,"" the notice says.  The advisory also points to the fluctuating market value of digital currencies, as well as the threat of theft for holders.  ""The bottom line: There are many investment opportunities among the above mentioned categories, but before making any decisions with your money, ask questions, and do your homework,"" the note concludes.  This warning follows the publication of similar advice last March, and comes amid a heightened period of volatility that has seen the digital currency fluctuate between $300 and $500 over the past few weeks.

Created through Visa Europe Collab, the trade organization’s innovation initiative, the proof-of-concept is being built in collaboration with Epiphyte, an enterprise blockchain services firm that recently graduated from San Mateo incubator Boost VC.  Though details on the proof-of-concept were limited, the companies said they are working in a ""controlled test environment"" that is seeking to simulate real-world remittance transactions.  A press release by Visa Europe Collab indicated the company initiated the project as it believes blockchain technology could have valuable applications in the payment services industry, solving traditional industry pain points as it matures.  Visa Europe Collab innovation partner Jon Downing said in a statement:  ""There is a real opportunity to develop an improved remittance service for both the sender and receiver of payments in terms of fees, speed and ease of use.""  The news comes amid continued assertions by executives in the traditional remittance industry, such as MoneyGram and Western Union, that digital currencies and blockchain-based systems will not be able to solve problems in the sector.  A membership association that oversees Visa-branded products in European market, Visa Europe was recently purchased by Visa for as much as $23.4bn in cash and stock. Previously, Visa Europe had operated as a separate publicly traded entity.  The proof-of-concept announcement showcases the common ground at the now-united entities, as it follows Visa’s debut of a blockchain-based car leasing concept at the Money20/20 trade show in Las Vegas and its participation in Chain’s $30m Series A funding round, finalized this September.  The Visa Europe proof-of-concept is expected to be completed within two months, according to the company.

42378366,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i1gX,1447341016,Norwegian Bank Standards Office Plans Blockchain Summit,"Bankenes StandardiseringsKontor (BSK), a Norway-based private banking standards body, is planning to unite financial industry stakeholders for a forthcoming meeting on blockchain technology.  Founded in 1994  by all the domestic banks, BSK is tasked with establishing and maintaining industry standards for payment systems, IT security and information exchange. Further, BSK's board of directors include representatives from some of the country's largest financial institutions, including DNB and SpareBank.  An internal note issued by BSK indicated that, while the organization believes the impact of the technology is not assured, the rising interest in its use necessitates immediate supervisory action.  Terje Sletbak, principal advisor at BSK, told CoinDesk:  ""BSK will in the near future invite experts and executives from the financial industry in Norway and relevant regulatory authorities. Our purpose is in the first place to share our knowledge about the new technology, and discuss possible applications for the financial services industry.""  ""We will initially arrange a roundtable conference with some selected experts in the industry, with the purpose to establish a collaborative forum to conduct research into the technology, in addition to establishing practical test cases,"" he added.  According to Sletbak, BSK is not currently involved in any specific blockchain projects.

42378368,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i1j3,1447331416,Bitly Alternative Cred Rewards Social Sharers With Bitcoin,"A new bitcoin application is seeking to impact the online advertising space with a Bitly alternative that rewards users in bitcoin.  Called Cred, the application seeks to encourage readers to share content through specialized links that generate monetary rewards. The difference between Cred and existing URL management platforms is that, in addition to a link shortener, the application inserts its own advertisements into the user experience.  “There’s a page between the platforms and the content, so that’s an opportunity for an advertiser to display an ad based on where you’re going,” Cred creator and online advertising veteran Cameron Hejazi told CoinDesk.  Social influencers in turn will receive $1 for every thousand impressions they drive to the content, payments Cred aims to bootstrap while it seeks larger advertising partners.  Hejazi acknowledges that the service could use traditional payment methods, but said he was encouraged by the fact that the bitcoin community is already using more grassroots content monetization products, like social tipping service ChangeTip.  He said:  ""I chose the bitcoin community because ... there is a lot of recognition for how individual value can be measured and rewarded.""  Advertising first  To date, most bitcoin-based content monetization initiatives have focused on emphasizing how the digital currency can be an alternative to advertising.  Efforts like Bitmonet and BitWall, for example, have mostly focused on putting bitcoin payment barriers between users and content.  Hejazi, however, said that he believes advertisers and corporations represent a much bigger market, one that has stronger incentives than consumers to use bitcoin given the consumer-facing user experience issues that occur with an unfamiliar form of payment.  ""There’s always a channel between a publisher and an advertiser, and it’s becoming increasingly important for there to be an incentive for a user,"" Hejazi said. ""The person tweeting about content with 5,000 followers, there’s value there that hasn't been tapped.""  In turn, Hejazi said he believes that online advertisers will see value in the service as it will be able to target users based on their destination.  “This allows advertisers to display information relevant to where you’re about to see, rather than where you [have] been [as in the existing models],” he added.  Attracting users  That's not to say that Cred can exist without users. Now out of beta, Cred is promoting its product through targeted social media advertising and bitcoin community outreach.  To accommodate users at scale, the platform is also seeking to work around the issues that currently arise when sending micropayments over the bitcoin blockchain. For example, all Cred transactions are done ""off blockchain"" through bitcoin services firm Coinbase.  This means that smaller transactions can be sent without fees, but that both Cred advertisers and users will need to register for an account with Coinbase, though Hejazi said the option was the most convenient way for it to realize the user experience he wanted.  So far, Hejazi said the service has only attracted a few dozen users, though he is optimistic that social influencers will seek to be rewarded for practices they already engage in without incentive everyday.  He concluded:  ""This space is ripe for some sort of innovation.""
