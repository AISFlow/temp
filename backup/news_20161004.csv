42399380,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj1z7,1475607436,Bill Gross: Central Banks Are Pushing Investors to Bitcoin,"Risky markets and an incapable central banking culture could drive investors into the arms of bitcoin and gold, billionaire asset manager Bill Gross opined in a recent note to investors.  Gross, who founded the Pacific Investment Management Co and now spearheads the Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund, dubbed markets a ""casino"", and said that low returns in an environment of zero-cost debt could ultimately push some investors to take their money elsewhere – thus risking further destabilization.  He wrote in a note to Janus investors, published today:  ""Bitcoin and privately agreed upon blockchain technologies amongst a small set of global banks, are just a few examples of attempts to stabilize the value of their current assets in future purchasing power terms. Gold would be another example — historic relic that it is. In any case, the current system is beginning to be challenged.""  What that outflow might look like, Gross didn't elaborate on. However, he opined that markets are in a very risky position and that ""it is capitalism itself that is threatened"" by current central bank policies, which since the 2008 financial panic have pursued a strategy of low interest rates and the monetization of debt.  ""Investors/savers are now scrappin' like mongrel dogs for tidbits of return at the zero bound,"" Gross wrote, concluding:  ""This cannot end well.""

42378851,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mF4v,1475604727,IBM Invests $200 Million in Blockchain-Powered IoT,"IBM’s previously announced work intersecting blockchain and AI is moving forward with the establishment of a new office in Germany.  The announcement is part of a broader technology push initiated this week by IBM, which is investing $200m to fuel its internet of things (IoT) efforts.  IBM is opening a new office in Munich to spearhead those initiatives, within which its blockchain work on connected devices is based.  IBM, a founding member of the open-source Hyperledger project, emerged earlier this year as a strong advocate for the technology. It has since pursued a variety of projects involving blockchain, from dispute resolution systems to cloud-based security frameworks.  With the $200m in hand, IBM will staff its Munich office with as many as 1,000 employees.  The company said today:  “Businesses can share IoT data in a secure, private blockchain to reduce the costs and complexities of doing business across a network of people and goods. This capability is fully integrated into IBM Blockchain.”  IBM highlighted its work with Kinno, a Finnish firm that is using IBM’s blockchain-infused IoT tools to develop supply chain tracking capabilities.  “Using the technology, Kinno is developing a solution that tracks, monitors, and reports on container status and location, and optimizes packing and transfer of shipments through shipping lanes,” the company said in a statement.

42378849,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mF2P,1475593233,"Scams or Not, Crypto Tokens Have History on Their Side","Alex Millar is a blogger, podcaster and YouTube publisher with a degree in engineering physics from Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada.  In this opinion piece, Millar looks at how cryptographic tokens can be viewed in a long line of historical investment instruments, and why despite the scams, there remains an argument they should be allowed to continue.  Even before the emergence of money, victims of a crop failures often took short-term food loans and paid them back with interest. When money emerged, interest was usually paid in either a fraction or a multiple of 12 to simplify accounting.  The practice of charging interest on loans, called ""usury,"" has been frequently and widely condemned, regulated or outlawed by authorities beginning with the Buddhist Jatakas texts from 600-400 BC. Critics claim usury exploits the needy, is a form of unearned income, and contributes to inequality.  Basic economics shows that capping the price of anything creates a supply shortage.  Interest is simply the price of borrowing money and capping interest reduces the incentive to lend, thereby creating a shortage of loans. A shortage of loans means that lenders willing to lend on the black market can charge more interest than would be possible in an unregulated market.  In this way, those who attempt to protect borrowers by regulating usury risk doing more harm than good. To make matters worse, disputes in a black market cannot be settled using a public arbiter, which means that those who are wronged often turn to violence or threats of violence.  A window for scammers  In the Middle Ages, contracts emerged that legally skirted anti-usury laws by tying repayment to profit, rather than time. These contracts varied in terms of who profited and who would be held liable for losses. The classic commenda contract rewarded one-quarter of profits to the laboring partner, with three quarters of profits, and all the risk, to the investor.  Many early trade voyages were funded through contracts called societas, which introduced the concept of limited liability, and often divided the equity of a ship into 24 shares, called carati. After the completion of each voyage, the ship and its assets were liquidated, with profits returned to shareholders.  Over time, the complexity of these contracts grew. In 1602, the Dutch East India Company sold shares not in a voyage, but in a fleet of ships that continually traded with Asia. This made accounting more difficult, as amortization of assets had to estimated to calculate profits. To make accounting even more complicated, this new breed of companies had hundreds of shares, each of which could be traded on the free market.  It was impossible for shareholders to check the veracity of large companies' accounts. However, darkness in knowledge is hidden by the brightness of great profits.  This opened a window of opportunity for scammers. Before its first ship ever left harbor, the South Seas Company used investor funds to open posh offices in the best parts of London. Stock prices initially skyrocketed then crashed when dividends failed to materialize.  The effect of regulation  Over time, regulations have been enacted to protect investors.  However, like laws that cap interest rates, these new regulations often have negative unintended consequences. For example, take accredited investor laws, which make it illegal for low-net-worth individuals to invest in non-established companies.  The effect of these laws is to redirect capital from new ventures to established companies, like The First Hawaiian Bank. Founded in 1858, the bank now has 2,250 employees.  In August, it raised $485m in an IPO. Surely established banks have good reasons to raise funds, but in the absence of accredited investor laws, some of the capital that funds banks would instead fund innovative startups.  Accredited investor laws also give wealthy investors an unfair advantage because a reduced supply of capital for new ventures creates cheaper prices.  A new financial dawn  This article was inspired by Preston Byrne's article Against Tokens (And Token Crowdsales), in which he argues that crowdsales are illegal and are usually scams. I don't disagree with either of those statements. However, just because something is illegal, that doesn't make it wrong or undesirable. At one time, it was illegal for women to vote.  Furthermore, even a company with a thumbs up from the Securities and Exchange Commission isn't prevented from scamming shareholders, as evidenced by the options backdating scandal at Apple. This is an example of the fence paradox, which illustrates how regulations can often cause greater harm by making people feel safe.  Like the contracts that emerged, in part, to skirt anti-usury laws, cryptocurrency has emerged, in part, to skirt today's financial regulation. Anyone can now create, sell and trade cryptographic tokens that represent equity (or debt) in a company. Any investor can pay any entrepreneur, and remain anonymous if he wishes.  Of course, there will be scams and failures. And sometimes, there will be successes. Those who succeed will probably not do so with complicated 44-page white papers, they will do so with new, simple and transparent contracts and ideas for creating wealth.  Irrespective of the law, the legal suppression of innovators looking for funds and people looking to invest is ending. This is good news because it means the resource that is money will become more efficiently deployed.

42378860,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mFDj,1475582266,Why CGI Doubled Down on Ripple's Distributed Ledger Tech,"It began with nine CGI employees holed up at Ripple's San Francisco headquarters.  Spread out in two separate rooms, the team of engineers, developers, architects, testers and analysts worked side-by-side with the distributed ledger startup's staff for a week to integrate Ripple's DLT solutions into its infrastructure. And that was just the beginning of work that culminated at Sibos with the launch of CGI's new Ripple validator node.  Revealed on Tuesday in Geneva, the validator node gives the $14.1bn company a firsthand look into how a live distributed ledger network operates, offering a window into how their clients might be able to capitalize on Ripple's blockchain-inspired real-time payments solution.  ""It's a third eye,"" CGI's head of innovation Michael O’Loughlin told CoinDesk at Sibos last week.  To O'Loughlin, the node represents a shift in perspective from being able to explain to his clients how a distributed ledger operates to being able to describe what it feels like.  But according to Ripple's vice president of product, Asheesh Birla, the node also gives CGI influence.  Birla told CoinDesk:  ""By actually being part of the network through a validating node they can be part of the roadmap, they can give us features and direction to the way they want the project to go.""  A public declaration  According to O'Loughlin, the node is also a sign to CGI's 2,500 clients that his company is committed to distributed ledgers and will continue to be so if they decide to start building their own applications.  But the announcement that CGI is running a node is about more than just publicity or earning its client's trust to those involved. Rather, it's a part of the network's approach to consensus building.  Once a node is set up, its manager helps determine the validity of transactions based on certain protocol requirements. Specifically, a validator groups transactions into ordered units to help prevent the simultaneous spending of the same funds in two different places, also called double spending.  Unlike the bitcoin network, Ripple's consensus algorithm relies in part on trust.  To help ensure the accuracy of the most recent version of the ledger — the last closed ledger (LCL), validators curate a list of other nodes they believe are unlikely to defraud them.  Only transactions on a validator's Unique Node List (UNL) will be confirmed and the main two factors Ripple encourages operators to consider when building that list are a node's past performance and the operator's identity.  Though it is free to set up a validator, the only other companies or institutions that have publicly announced they have done so are Microsoft and MIT. There are currently a total of 122 nodes (none of which require any of the network's native XRP cryptocurrency to operate).  The intersection  Since building one of the earliest Ripple proofs-of-concept in 2014, CGI has expanded its work with the distributed ledger into new areas.  In July, CGI announced that it had integrated Ripple into its Intelligent Gateway service, used for sending Swift transaction messages.  Then, at Sibos earlier this week CGI announced it has launched a blockchain laboratory for its customers to experiment with using Ripple for trade finance.  The man in charge of that blockchain lab, vice president of consulting, Kittredge Carswell, said the Intelligent Gateway service is actually a nexus between CGI's trade finance work and the payments-related projects.  Carswell described how his trade effort would intersect with the work of O’Loughlin's payments team:  ""We also will be able to build out other application layers there for blockchain solutions and that we provide the integration layer through our intelligent gateway. This is the same gateway that’s also being used in the payments practice to add Ripple as a payment channel.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple.
