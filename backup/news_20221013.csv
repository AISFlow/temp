42393775,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpAnj7,1665700308,Popular Bitcoin Astrologer’s Star Falls on Twitter Following $30K in Celsius Payments,"Maren Altman, a popular bitcoin and ether-focused astrologist, is suddenly a fallen star among some Twitter critics. A newly surfaced court document shows she received $30,000 in marketing payments from the crypto lender Celsius Network in the months before it declared bankruptcy.  Altman’s Twitter critics say she received the money to create favorable content about Celsius while the company was suffering cash flow issues, and they criticized her for being less than forthcoming about the payments.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Altman, who offers investing predictions based partly on her astrological interpretations to a vast social media audience that includes more than 237,000 Twitter followers, acknowledged that Celsius paid her but called the Twitter accusations “a witch hunt.” She said she has spoken with an attorney about possible legal action, such as suing for defamation.  “My error was trusting Celsius,” she said. Did she know about Celsius’ finances, Altman said, “Not a clue, no visibility on anything other than my marketing campaign.”  The uproar comes as Celsius is embroiled in lengthy, complicated court proceedings over how to pay back irate shareholders and customers. A court document released last week showed Celsius founder and former CEO Alex Mashinsky and another executive withdrew $17 million from the platform right before the company froze user accounts and filed for bankruptcy.  Celsius’ problems have contributed to a wider free fall in crypto prices and a loss of confidence in the industry’s future. The lender attributed its woes to the implosion of algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST) and its sister coin LUNA.  In recent years, a number of crypto companies have paid social media influencers to widen awareness about their businesses.  But what Altman described as a “partnership” has raised the hackles of industry observers sensitive to Celsius’ financial management and the timing of her contract.  Like a fashion ad?  Altman, a prominent influencer who has more than 1.8 million followers across Tik Tok, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram, gained a significant following during the last bull run for posting crypto trading content that integrated astrology.  In March 2022, Celsius and Altman agreed to a marketing influencer sponsorship. In her YouTube videos Altman said Celsius is her home for crypto and highlighted the ease of buying crypto on Celsius.  Altman told CoinDesk in an interview that her partnership was “no different than me doing a fashion ad for a company.”  Shared with CoinDesk, Altman's contract with Celsius indicated that she would receive US$15,000 per calendar month “in exchange for 2 (two) YouTube video mid-roll advertisements per calendar month and 2 (two) mentions of Celsius delivered on Tik Tok.”  But the contract also stated that as a Celsius partner, Altman should “NOT TALK ABOUT CEL TOKEN. No past, present or future statements, analysis, charts of information of any kind.”  Altman added, “I’m not allowed to talk about anything illegal for U.S. standards, which includes the CEL token pumping or whatnot.”  Included in Altman’s Celsius-related YouTube videos was a disclosure that the lender paid for the promotion.  Altman’s last YouTube video promoting Celsius was on May 24.  According to Altman, Celsius suddenly ended the contract in May 2022, saying it was restructuring and would not continue any creator contracts. The turnabout came right as crypto markets were crashing: TerraForm Labs collapsed in May and Celsius halted withdrawals, swaps and transfers in June, citing “extreme market conditions.”  The backlash begins  The outrage about Altman’s relationship with Celsius emerged recently when the pseudonymous Twitter account @BowTiedIguana posted a screenshot from the 14,500 page Celsius court filing, which shows two $15,000 pay stubs from Celsius to Altman.  The publicly available court document, which shows the financial records of Celsius’ co-founders, also includes the April 21 and May 26 payments from Celsius to Altman.  The situation intensified when ZachXBT, a Twitter account that investigates on-chain hacks and scams, accused Altman of being dishonest about receiving payment from Celsius, highlighting an interview she’d done with Mashinsky. ZachXBT posted a screenshot of the interview’s comments section that showed Altman saying, “I wasn’t paid [crap]” in response to someone who asked, “Did Mashinsky pay you in CEL token?”  Crypto YouTuber Aaron Bennett, who has more than 54,300 subscribers, neatly summarized why critics were hounding Altman:  Other anons have accused Altman of being a “grifter” and “poop witch,” and said her company was a “Ponzi scheme.”  In an Oct. 9 blog post, Altman acknowledged the paid partnership with Celsius but said the Mashinsky interview was “a favor and not paid.”  The Twitter war of words did bring out some defenders for Altman, including Eric Wall X (@ercwl), who posted that Altman had “staked a significant portion of her social capital doing marketing for this business [Celsius] which she’d suffer from if they turned out to be scumbags, which she’s doing now, nothing crazy.”  Altman said that she couldn’t “overstate the viciousness and insanity of the threats. … It’s like a witch hunt for someone they don’t even know. … The equivalent of this would be like if I was paid by Peloton to talk about their bike and investors blamed me for the stock price going down.”  James Rubin and Bradley Keoun contributed to reporting.",NEGATIVE,LUNA,BTC | BUSINESS | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING,Sage D.

42394618,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASUehA,1665696522,"Market Wrap: Prices Plunge Following Hot Inflation Report, Then Reverse Course Completely","Price Action  Bitcoin and ether sold off sharply before reversing course following the release of unexpectedly high inflation numbers from Thursday's Consumer Price Index (CPI).  Bitcoin (BTC) sold off immediately after the report, declining 3% within minutes of the data release. Volume during the sell-off was eight times higher than average BTC volume for that time of day. BTC declined below $19,000 and approached lows of $18,100 on the day.  Ether (ETH) declined as well, falling 5% on excessive volume. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after bitcoin is now trading at just below $1,300  In broader crypto markets, the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, increased by 0.26%.  Macro View  The Consumer Price Index (CPI) data that markets have been waiting for arrived on Thursday morning with what appeared to be bad news for anyone bullish on risk assets, cryptocurrencies included.  The CPI, which monitors U.S. inflationary pressures, increased 8.2% in September versus the consensus estimate of 8.1%. “Core” CPI, which strips out volatile energy and food prices, rose 6.6% compared with expectations of 6.5%. September’s inflation figures are the highest in 40 years,  Month-over-month inflation rose 0.4%, the highest reading in three months, and above the consensus of estimates for a 0.2% increase. The increase stemmed from increases in the price of shelter and food, which were offset in part by declining gas prices.  Aside from a summertime dip in energy prices, inflation has remained stubbornly high. Energy costs could potentially be pushed higher by OPEC’s recent decision to reduce oil production.  The month-over-month figures seem especially troubling, given the lack of short-term price improvement, despite the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) efforts to stem inflation.  The bottom line: Following the CPI release, the probability of a 75 basis point increase in the federal funds rate increased to 95% from 85% a day prior, according to the CME FedWatch tool. The probability of a 100 basis point jumbo increase now stands at 5%.  Economic Calendar  Another report that investors likely eyed is Thursday’s EIA report on U.S. gasoline and oil inventories. Inventories for both crude oil and gasoline were shown to have declined in the previous week. An increase in supplies would likely have pushed energy prices significantly higher.  Finally, initial jobless claims for the week ending Oct. 8 came in at 228,000, above expectations for 215,000 claims.  Latest Prices  ● CoinDesk Market Index (CMI): 944.23 +0.4%        ● Bitcoin (BTC): $19,373 +1.2%        ● Ether (ETH): $1,294 −0.4%        ● S&P 500 daily close: 3,669.91 +2.6%        ● Gold: $1,673 per troy ounce +0.2%        ● Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.95% +0.05        Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  Bitcoin and Ether Dropped Sharply After Disappointing Inflation Figures  Bitcoin and ether both dropped sharply following the CPI release, but began to come back up in subsequent hours. After falling as sharply as 3% and 5% respectively in early trading, prices eventually rose 1% for BTC and declined 0.65% for ETH.  Traditional markets responded in similar fashion, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 declining as U.S. markets opened before reversing course. All three indexes finished the day in positive territory.  The extreme reversal over a two-hour span will likely confound most market participants expecting a steep, more permanent decline, and certainly not a return to the status quo of the last few weeks.  Investors may want to monitor the inflow of bitcoin onto exchanges within the coming days. Over the last week, wallets holding more than 1,000 BTC have been moving coins off exchanges, generally a bullish signal as those coins are often moved into cold storage.  A reversal of this trend would indicate that larger BTC investors were surprised by the inflation report and are now looking to reduce their positions. However, a continuation would signal ongoing bitcoin resiliency and sustained conviction by BTC holders.  If the latter is the case, today’s price reversal seems likely to have resulted from greater conviction among investors, who stepped in to acquire BTC at more favorable prices.  Put open interest at the $19,000 strike price sank approximately 39% as many investors exercised their puts while BTC fell close to $18,000. In spot markets, buying volume seemed to have increased as prices reached near the $18,400 level, with bullish investors stepping in to provide buying demand.  The Volume Profile Visible range tool shows BTC’s rapid descent through a low-volume node between $19,000 and $18,400 during the 12:00 UTC (8:00 a.m. ET) hour. The decline was matched in pace by the reversal higher through the same node during the 15:00 UTC (11:00 a.m. ET) hour.  BTC’s price now sits at just north of $19,150, coinciding with an area of significant agreement between buyers and sellers in recent weeks.  Despite markets’ hectic start, ultimately prices moved little on the day.

42421231,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXhqs1,1665696318,Stablecorp Wants to Reduce Cross-Border Payment Friction,"Venture investor Alex McDougall is embarking on a new endeavor that looks to simplify cross-border digital asset payments.  Stablecorp Inc., a fintech firm using bank-grade blockchain technology, was founded by 3iQ, Canada’s largest crypto asset manager and blockchain development company, Mavennet Systems.  Alex McDougall is presenting at Investing in Digital Enterprises and Assets Summit (I.D.E.A.S.), CoinDesk's newest event revealing the most scalable marketplaces in the digital economy that will attract institutional capital in the years to come.  Learn directly from entrepreneurs in leading innovation across digital assets, Web3, blockchain and the metaverse. Register here.  “We’re trying to deliver a bank-like experience,” McDougall said, “except with no bank attached to it.”  The Ontario-based startup saw an opportunity to participate in the financial system of digital assets after encountering challenges with traditional banking infrastructure, said McDougall.  “We built Stablecorp not as this radical getaway from TradeFi [traditional finance], but as the logical next step of evolution,” he said.  See also: StoryDAO and the Quest to Recreate Hollywood  Stablecorp aims to facilitate a cross-border version of on-chain commerce. To smooth out the friction inherent to this endeavor, Stablecorp has sought help from other platforms.  Presently, the company only works with American-based companies, including peer-to-peer payment company Circle as well as the nonprofit Stellar Development Foundation. In April, Stablecorp raised $1.5 million in a seed funding round, which was led by six companies, including Side Door Ventures and Genesis. Stablecorp is worth upwards of $5 million at the moment, said McDougall.  The company can be broken down into three parts. The first is the consumer-facing arm of the company, known as Grapes Finance, which launched last week and gives users the option to exchange their fiat currency for USDC or QCAD stablecoins.  Its second component is yield-as-a-service (YAAS), a tool that allows individuals and firms to borrow and lend data related to digital assets. Its final offering, known as the “Forge,” is a multi-chain software that gives individuals and firms alike the ability to track whether a deposit has been made.  The company is also working to bring cross-border capabilities to “spot desk, derivatives trading and currency hedging” while using on-chain assets. In addition, when a user onboards via Grapes Finance, it technically onboards with other counterparties, which can, in turn, grow the services that company offers, as well as their client base.  At its simplest level, McDougall said, Stablecorp is trading on models that already exist, but doing so with better risk analytics structures.  Prospective investors should “know that there's a kernel of magic in here, that is the blockchain world,” McDougall said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/10/13/stablecorp-wants-to-reduce-cross-border-payment-friction,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6267b33da0e832b8410fee616468a3f3e85365b3-3725x3432.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42394601,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASUeRQ,1665695458,CoinShares Releases Experimental AI Bot That Tries to Calculate the Fair Price for an NFT,"Europe-based digital asset management platform CoinShares released an experimental artificial intelligence (AI) bot on Thursday that might be able to help traders determine a fair price for some non-fungible tokens (NFT).  The experimental project, called CoinSharesNFTAI, aggregates different sets of data to provide a user with what it determines is afair price for a rotating list of top NFT collections on OpenSea, the most popular NFT marketplace. To interact with the bot, you need to grab the OpenSea link for a particular NFT of interest and tweet this at the bot. In turn, the bot will respond with an estimated value.  CoinDesk interacted with the bot using Doodle #8859, which last sold on October 18, 2021, for 4.5 ETH, or roughly $16,800 at the time. According to the bot, the NFT has since depreciated in value to 9.61 ETH, or about $12,234.  CoinShares says the bot runs an algorithm every week to calculate the prices of ""the freshest collections."" For the week of Oct. 10-16, this includes blue chip projects such as CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, Clonex, Moonbirds, Doodles, Azuki and 44 others. In the future, the bot will have permanent collections that it returns prices on, but as of Thursday, it did not list any NFT projects as a ""permanent collection.""  ""Pricing NFTs is no easy task,"" the company tweeted on Thursday. ""Their value is volatile and millions of them are available on the market, from established projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club to more obscure artists with no trading history.""  According to the bot's research paper, the algorithm builds upon the hedonic model to construct a price index from ""thousands of NFT transaction records."" Its data focuses on Ethereum NFTs and uses Opensea's official API to download the properties and past sales of certain NFT collections.  By Thursday afternoon, a number of people had tweeted at the bot, with the bot spitting out numbers that in some cases were much lower than the current best offers being made on OpenSea. Several users expressed skepticism of the tool's accuracy when the estimated value of their owned NFTs came back lower than expected.  ""Your model sucks lmao,"" tweeted Jack Hermes, aka systemic_bliss, whose GoblinTown NFT that he purchased on July 8 for 2.6 ETH (roughly $3,170) was valued at 0.88 ETH, or about $1,124.48.  ""The AI thought its value was below the [current] floor price,"" he told CoinDesk. ""That was interesting, so I figure it suggests the price that will get bought quickest.""  A spokesperson for CoinShares said that while NFT pricing might seem mysterious, its prices are driven by ""many factors"" such as hype, rarity traits and real-world utility.  ""Some of these attributes are quantifiable – even hype is not as elusive a factor as it might seem,"" the spokesperson said. ""To evaluate the hype of a specific collection, we can count its followers on social media platforms, as well as the volume and value of past transactions. The same applies to rarity within a collection, by looking at the attributes of the asset.""  ""An NFT collector may rely on market research or follow sentiment on social media to get a feel for each NFT’s value, but they might not put a specific number behind it,"" the spokesperson added. ""Our model accesses the same data but uses complex mathematical operations to make the best price prediction possible.""  Still, the spokesperson noted that the bot is still a ""prototype"" that uses relatively little data compared to the vast number of possible metrics that exist within the NFT market.  ""Use it to experiment with NFTs and your collection, and not as the sole data point to make purchase and sell decisions,"" the spokesperson advised.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Rosie Perper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/10/13/coinshares-releases-experimental-ai-bot-that-tries-to-calculate-the-fair-price-for-an-nft,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c4a6363b257d6a5263b01f811f0ea648ef5f7611-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Its mission was decentralized money and a peer-to-peer payment system. But pretty quickly people started to emphasize a different perspective on the Bitcoin project: its role not as a currency but as a new form of computing. Forming circa 2015-2016, these observers (known as Blockchain-Not-Bitcoin) said: “Well, I don’t care about decentralized money and a peer-to-peer payment system, but we’re really excited about the underlying blockchain technology.”  This sort of thought process is not unique to Bitcoin or crypto. The internet started as something prosaic (a means for researchers to share information) and has now evolved to shape the highly dynamic world of today.  Blockchain tech is a foundational shift in computing, allowing investors to get excited about new use cases for technology because with new use cases come new opportunities for financial return. Bitcoin’s success is in computing and digitization.  This article is part of CoinDesk's ""I.D.E.A.S. Week."" Register here to become a part of the Investing in Digital Enterprises and Assets Summit (I.D.E.A.S.), a new conference focused on the innovations happening across digital assets, Web3, blockchain and the metaverse.

Max is part of the team that developed CoinDesk’s Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS), which aims to provide taxonomy with comprehensive and standardized industry definitions and classifications for digital assets.  Let’s dive in.  What is computing?  The computing sector, as defined by CDI, consists of projects that aim to decentralize the sharing, storing and transmission of data. CDI further breaks down this sector into five industry groups: oracles, shared storage, internet-of-things, private computing and shared network.  The types of projects and companies included in these groups dabble in on-chain and off-chain data transmission, social data platforms, peer-to-peer secure data transactions, open networks, free-market private computation, and decentralized file storage and sharing.  OK, but what do all of these mean? My conversation with Max Good suggested that the two sub-categories in computing with the most to offer at present are oracles and shared storage.  Oracles  Oracles send data from the outside world, like the price of bitcoin or the temperature in Orange County, to a blockchain so specific data can execute the disbursement of money. Right now, the world of on-chain to on-chain oracles is relatively robust. For example, there are price index feeds available via oracle networks powered by Chainlink that feed into futures trading contracts powered by Ethereum. From Good’s perspective, the important thing about these price feeds is the “index’s methodology is replicable, which makes them candidates for easy and transparent auditing.”  When we discussed the “next big thing” in oracles, Good said the next natural step comes from effectively connecting the real world to on-chain by “providing an infrastructure service that facilitates on-chain activities governed by the incorporation of off-chain data.” This is where the so-called oracle problem lies. It is difficult for blockchains, even with oracles, to securely interact with external sources of data.  Read more: Investing in Web3: Culture and Entertainment  For clarity’s sake, here’s an example where an oracle may or may not help. Let’s imagine a thermometer that feeds into an oracle is put into a refrigerated 18-wheeler carrying perishable food. There is an insurance policy on that perishable food that is built into a smart contract. The insurance policy will cover the financial damage of the spoilage of that perishable food if a) the food is spoiled upon arrival and b) the temperature of the trailer was continually kept below 55 degrees. The insurance policy will automatically pay out if these a) and b) are satisfied.  Proving that a) happened is somewhat difficult but likely trivial for all stakeholders involved with the transport of the food; b) is even more difficult. How can we guarantee that the thermometer functioned properly or otherwise not tampered with? How do we know the oracle was not somehow paid off-chain (or on another chain) to lie about the temperature in the trailer? What’s the point of having a decentralized oracle as the source of truth on what the real-world data says if the real-world data can be manipulated and there’s no way to double-check the data?  But there are a lot of projects working on the oracle problem, which you can check out on CoinDesk’s Indices DACS 500 list.  Shared storage  Shared storage refers to the decentralization of storage servers that are, traditionally, owned and operated by a central organization. On its face, the shared storage protocols have a clear investment merit. In the world of cloud storage where big companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft dominate, keeping you or your company’s sensitive information safe from competitors and potential hackers is attractive.  Shared storage platforms, to their credit, aim to increase security of data storage by running on a blockchain network that allows for privacy and pseudonymity of data transmitters. That said, there are two particular places where shared storage projects might run into potential headwinds.  The first is simply economies of scale and the cost. It’s really not that expensive to store data with a centralized company when it has literally exabytes of capacity (an exabyte is huge, like 500 billion photos huge), plenty of deployable capital and know-how to store even more data in data centers.  The second is reliability, which needs to be achieved without a corporate third party. A corporate third party can be held liable for losing your data. To get around liability, current shared storage crypto projects use schemes such as proof-of-storage to check that the disparate parties storing your data do in fact have that data stored.  Given its immense competitive disadvantage, shared storage projects are not as well built-out as oracle projects. Given this, there doesn’t seem to be a short-term opportunity for investors, but there is certainly something attractive about decentralizing the storage of potentially sensitive and confidential data.  Digitization, digitization, digitization  The digitization sector, as defined by CDI, refers to the process by which real-world documents, contracts and the like are uploaded to a blockchain for the purpose of transparency, publicly verifiable ownership and immutability. According to DCI, digitization is currently the smallest sector in the DACS, but it has a wide range of potential use cases like helping brands establish digital identity or establishing ownership of real estate through blockchain-izing deeds to property.  Blockchain-enabled digitization has already taken root in the realm of digital identity with projects like Ethereum Name Service (ENS). ENS allows users to convert a public Ethereum address into a recognizable identifying name on the blockchain. Be it nike.eth or george.eth, these more digestible (and memorable) addresses, like domain names, have obvious advantages for companies for branding purposes, and for individuals for vanity purposes.  Read more: Bitcoin and Beyond: The Future of Cryptocurrency Investing  Of course, any discussion about digitization enabled by crypto will be incomplete without what feels like the oldest use case of them all: Allowing patients to digitize their medical records to enable faster exchange of information without loss of privacy. While this, on paper, sounds like a wonderful use case and implementation of digitization, there are significant headwinds inherent in how health-care information sharing, especially in the United States, is structured.  In the U.S., health-care provider billing practices and claims management large payers still rely on fax machines. Further complicating the issue is how the proliferation of electronic health records (EHR) occurred. In 2009, the U.S. Affordable Care Act provided incentives for health-care providers to implement federally approved IT systems. Companies were reeling after the 2008 financial crisis and took advantage of these incentives by swiftly putting together projects that were ultimately implemented in a disjointed manner.  Sure, this has become more cohesive with companies like Cerner, Epic and athenahealth working on the interoperability of these disparate systems. But the short-term issue with the “crypto” digitization of health care remains: The original digitization of health care was done so poorly there isn’t a layer that can be easily migrated from an old, dull non-crypto layer to a new, shiny crypto layer. You’d be better served blowing the system up and starting from scratch.  So is there nothing to invest in?  There are significant headwinds for the adoption of crypto projects focused on computing and digitization given how large the entrenched parties in the two spaces are. That doesn’t mean all attempts should be abandoned. To be sure, Bitcoin, the payment system, itself is looking for adoption in face of equally large entrenched parties.  All said, although these projects face significant headwinds in the short term, there are surely opportunities for the improved privacy, transparency and ownership that crypto promises to improve computing and digitization overall.

Crypto was coming off its biggest year yet, when coin prices reached all-time highs and mainstream adoption approached the tipping point. Hell, El Salvador had actually made bitcoin legal tender.  What followed is the Beijing Olympics, with almost no fans due to COVID-19 restrictions; the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, which has more nuclear warheads than any other country on the planet; and inflation at rates not seen since the 1970s and 1980s. Spectacular token failures and crypto scams gave way to crypto winter. Regulators across the globe are cracking down. Sanctions against Tornado Cash led to an arrest, and disbelief.  Meanwhile, non-fungible tokens (NFT) are on the decline (at least in terms of market value) after being the hottest thing in 2021. The metaverse is finding its way, and central bank digital currencies (CBDC) are plodding along in some countries while others continue to play will-they-or-won’t-they.

Veteran market analyst Peter Brandt tweeted last week that ADA, following sell off since the completion of the Vasil hardfork on the Cardano blockchain in September, will be on a decline all the way to $0.25.

42394605,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASUeWL,1665684371,Bitcoin Rebounds to Over $19K After Plunge Triggered by Hot Inflation Report,"Bitcoin rebounded to above $19,000 on Thursday in a wild day of trading that earlier saw the largest cryptocurrency dive after a hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation report.  Analysts were at pains to explain the logic of the move, because the Consumer Price Index report theoretically puts additional pressure on the Federal Reserve to keep ratcheting monetary policy tighter – usually a negative factor for prices of risky assets from stocks to cryptocurrencies.  U.S. stocks staged a comeback as well, and investors in traditional markets said it was possible that the negative news had already been accounted for by traders.  As of press time, bitcoin (BTC) was up 0.2% over the past 24 hours to about $19,100. In the minutes after the inflation report at 8:30 a.m. ET (12:30 UTC), the price tumbled to $18,198 – its lowest since Sept. 21 – but has been mostly climbing in the hours since. The CoinDesk Market Index is down 1.1%.  Read More: US Consumer Price Index for September Could Provide Push for Bitcoin to Break Out of Its Recent Range  “The (CPI) number came in quite close to expectations and thus had been largely priced in ahead of time,” said Riyad Carey, a research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko.  Ether (ETH) followed a similar trajectory on Thursday as BTC, plunging during the early U.S. trading hours and then recovering by midday. As of press time, it was off 0.9% to $1,280.  Thursday’s trading saga began when the Labor Department released its CPI report, showing that the inflation index rose 8.2% in September, which was faster than the 8.1% forecasted by economists.  Some market watchers homed in on a more striking figure – the ""core"" CPI that excludes volatile food and energy prices. That index rose 6.6% year-over-year to its highest level in four decades – a worrisome sign that the inflation might be becoming more entrenched in the economy.  But then, starting at around 11:05 a.m. ET, stocks rallied, with S&P 500 up 1.3%, Nasdaq rising 0.8% and Dow Jones gaining 1.8%, according to the Wall Street Journal’s data index. Crypto markets came along for the ride.  “For now, bitcoin buyers have to defend the $18,500 support with attempts to regain the $19,000 level remaining in the pursuit in the next couple of days,” Fuad Fatullaev, co-founder and CEO of Web3 ecosystem WeWay, said.  Despite the midday twist in stocks and crypto, investors in money markets clearly saw the report as hawkish: Trading in federal-fund futures on the CME reflects a 97% chance of a 75 basis point (0.75 percentage point) rate hike at the Federal Reserve’s next monetary-policy meeting in November; a hike of that size is triple the Fed’s more typical increment of 25 basis points in prior interest-rate cycles.  Data from the CME Group even now shows investors pricing in a 3% chance of a 100 basis point rate hike – practically unheard of since the high-inflation era of the early 1980s.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/13/bitcoin-rebounds-over-19k-after-plunge-triggered-by-hot-inflation-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c13a4d4d2343069d3203af6f4dd4075b0b283de7-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a partly redacted objection to Voyager’s proposed sale agreement, Voyager’s unsecured creditors committee (UCC) pushed back against the provision for “broad releases” that would shield the crypto lender’s directors and officers – the individuals “principally responsible for the debtors’ financial woes,” according to the filing – from future lawsuits.  In its current form, the sale agreement is contingent on the provision of legal immunity.  Attorneys for the UCC describe a “Hobson’s choice” for Voyager’s creditors: to either support the sale agreement as-is and have a chance at getting their money back faster while allowing Voyager’s executives to get off scot-free, or to fight the plan and risk the bankruptcy process “devolving into a morass of litigation, to the sole detriment of unsecured creditors, whose assets will continue to remain frozen for a far longer period of time.”  According to Wednesday’s filings, the UCC conducted an investigation into Voyager’s executives’ conduct to find out what the legal immunity would shield them from and called its findings “sobering.”  Details of the UCC’s findings are currently unavailable, but the attorneys argued that attempts to protect the executives from lawsuits were “particularly egregious” because of the potential for “colorable and valuable causes of action against these directors and officers.”  The UCC’s objection urges the court overseeing Voyager’s bankruptcy proceedings to reject the provision for legal immunity but proceed with the sale agreement.

Pine Street Labs wants to shake up the wallet experience for companies, funds, traders – really any business that needs to store tokens, says CEO Justin Gregorius. A veteran of crypto back offices, he told CoinDesk that enterprise newcomers find themselves in crypto wallet purgatory: They can’t rely on retail wallets like Ethereum’s MetaMask or Solana’s Phantom, but don’t have the know-how to build 10 wallets in-house.  Gregorius says his solution is a non-custodial crypto wallet API to let businesses plug and play across 12 different blockchains. Pine Street Labs’ five-person team takes care of the complex tech tuning – optimizing for staking in the Cosmos ecosystem, perhaps – so its novice clients won’t have to.  “We’re taking away the wallet engineering pains, the need for wallet engineers thinking in-house, “How do I build a DeFi, staking and NFT transaction on each different chain,’” Gregorius said of himself and co-founder Philip Glazman, referring to decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens.  The pair formed Pine Street Labs earlier this year after tackling some grant work building wallet infrastructure for Aleo and Umee. Gregorius said they realized there could be a niche for easy-to-use crypto wallet software that services multiple blockchains.  ""The industry is under a lot of strain dealing with the proliferation of different blockchains,” Glazman told CoinDesk.  Their own time deep in the crypto ecosystem’s business trenches helped direct the mission, Gregorius said. Firms such as Andresseen Horowitz and CoinList may be well-suited to scale their operations across multiple chains, but novice businesses don’t always have that luxury. And as businesses, they can’t just turn to browser-based solutions.  “We realized from our day to day experience how difficult it is for businesses to extend their wallets to do the types of things on chain that they want to do,” Gregorius said.

This comes after West shared anti-Semitic conspiracy theories in a series of social media ramblings in recent weeks, and his appearance on FOX’s “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” at times the most watched infotainment/evening news program in the U.S.  You’re reading this story on CoinDesk.com, a publication that’s sometimes called the “paper of record” for the cryptocurrency industry. Our mission is to provide balanced reporting and keen insights on the ongoing financial revolution kick-started by Bitcoin. The angle here, you can probably intuit just by context, is that this is why crypto matters.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Decentralized financial networks are color-blind, accessible to anyone with capital and a computer. Ye, as the artist and fashionista calls himself, has until Nov. 21 to find a new place to park his fortune. Maybe he’ll choose BTC or some yield-bearing decentralized finance (DeFi) program. There are also plenty of other banks or credit unions that, no doubt, would be thrilled to serve the billionaire.  I’m not going to wade into whether West’s recent antics cross the line – the guy revels in controversy and (quite conceivably) has a mental disorder. Unfortunately it’s impossible to judge whether Chase, the banking part of JPMorgan Chase, was justified in pushing him out – a letter from the bank, seemingly confirmed as real by West after it surfaced on Twitter, gives no formal reason.  But it’s worth saying a few things about “financial censorship.” Far from being a new phenomenon, this latter-day version of redlining seems to be accelerating in the U.S. and around the world. Regulators are even stepping into the realm of cryptocurrency to set boundaries around what protocols should (not can, because you can’t halt a smart contract) be used.  There are legitimate reasons for halting transactions and freezing accounts. As long as it's not discrimination based on race, sex, gender, religion, or other protected characteristics, businesses that refuse service are just practicing their rights. This is true, in my book, even when presidents get kicked off their favorite microblogging sites – it's a constitutional and moral matter.  What’s worrying is not the ability for banks to decide which clients they serve, but the arbitrariness with which they can act. The timing here, for West, seems to suggest the reputational risks for JPMorgan are no longer worth the business he brings in – but no one can say for sure.  West has had longstanding issues with JPMorgan Chase. Just last month he complained about not being able to get CEO Jamie Dimon on the phone, and also criticized executives in its wealth management and investment banking divisions. It’s entirely plausible West’s public condemnation of the bank was enough reason to prompt cutting him off, and that the timing of the revelation following the recent social media drama is coincidental.  See also: Web2 'Delenda Est,' You Say? | Opinion  The move by the bank parallels recent troubles with Adidas and Gap. It’s also not exactly clear if those longstanding corporate partners for West’s fashion line initiated the breakup or if it was Kanye. You can try reading his Instagram. But no one should be surprised when Corporate America bucks at a little controversy.  “It’s time for me to go it alone,” Ye said in an interview with Bloomberg last month. “It’s fine. I made the companies money. The companies made me money … Now it’s time for Ye to make the new industry. No more companies standing in between me and the audience.”  In one sense West is again ahead of the curve. Putting aside his apparent bigotry, his messages that are borderline incitements of violence, his egomania – West is deciding to go it alone. And likely the world will follow – not West himself, but in carving out their own paths.  This is a trend spurred by the advent of the internet, and supercharged by crypto: Digitization allows anyone to build a business, a brand, a life without intermediaries. Does it matter when banks penalize dissidents? Yes, but it has mattered less and less since bitcoin became an option.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/10/13/jpmorgan-closed-kanyes-account-yes-theres-a-crypto-angle,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5c2c4cf90336c0e14a1548dd2aee4540a406ddaa-4682x3116.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

What became everyday life would later define Miller's experience as a young adult, and would later manifest itself as organic dust toxic syndrome.  Developing hypersensitivity pneumonitis pushed Miller towards a degree in agriculture engineering. While studying agriculture, safety and health at the University of Iowa, Miller would find his purpose: helping people.  OccSaviors is a finalist in CoinDesk's Web3athon organized with CRADL. The winners are announced at the I.D.E.A.S. conference October 18 and 19.  Miller’s job as a certified industrial hygienist (CIH) has led him across the globe – to the outskirts of Idaho, the halfway islands of Marshall Islands, the Alyeska pipelines and even to Saudi Arabia – but time and time again he was reminded of the occupational health dangers affecting those working in gruesome jobs.  OccSaviors, an occupational health ecosystem founded by Miller, is turning to non-fungible tokens (NFT) and distributed ledger technology via the Hedera blockchain in an effort to increase awareness and education about occupational health hazards.  “There’s no system to tie everything together,” Miller told CoinDesk. “There’s no system in place to allow employees to track down their own employee exposure histories.”  According to the most recent report published by the Board for Global EHS Credentialing, a nonprofit organization, there are only 6,849 active certified industrial hygienists (CIH) worldwide, with a majority concentrated in the U.S.  See also: This Native American Tribe Leader Is Bringing Salmon Restoration to the Metaverse  Even with the resources behind the Occupational and Safety Health Administration (OSHA) in the U.S., “there’s just not enough help,” Miller said, including the need for better documentation methods to help future employees avoid exposure on the job.  OccSaviors is looking to tell the stories of those who have been affected in the past with the goal of relaying their experiences to those in the present. Fundamentally, the two-person team, consisting of Miller and developer Vinoth Gurusamy, looks to build “compassion with those who might not know” of the dangers that come with working in certain jobs.  The first “Radioactive” collection will feature 4,000 unique NFTs that will operate on a refer-to-earn basis. Miller says the idea behind this was to drive contributor participation, which will include feedback from specialists and consultants. Contributors may also include those who provide legal services and even those who may have had experience with ventilation controls or been exposed to a certain health hazard, he added.  Each of the OccSaviors NFTs will be tailored to a user and will feature an attached poem with a contributor’s specific story. Miller says the first iteration of NFTs will touch on the Radium Girls, a group of women who worked in factories painting watchdials and who suffered radium poisoning during the early 1920s. OccSavior NFT holders also have the option of creating their own message or poem, which will then be voted on by those within the community.  With a growing NFT ecosystem, Miller says Hedera was the best blockchain to build on because of its fast transaction speeds and its use of smart contracts.  Smart contracts in particular drew Miller to the blockchain. In a way, it establishes certain parameters, such as anonymity.  “Depending on how the information is gathered, it’s important to make sure it's confidential because they are medical records,” Miller said. “In our case, they’re exposure records.”  OccSaviors aims to be a decentralized system for employees to keep track of their own exposure history while also having the ability to take it with them if they so choose. The platform also hopes to break outside of the crypto ecosystem, and wants to be a tool that can be used by any worker anywhere in the world.  To date, there are 136 million chemical substances, but only 500 exposure limits in place. Resources too, are scarce, Miller added.  “[OccSaviors] is a disruptor and we’re trying to do it in a way that’s fair for everyone,” Miller said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/10/13/occsaviors-and-the-fight-for-honest-occupational-health-hazard-standards,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/25c611249f1e08b37f63c64cb052a560348b0e72-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394635,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASUgQP,1665677301,"Despite Crypto Bear Market, Web3 Developers Are Still Building, Study Shows","Some have seen the current crypto bear market as a good time for developers to build new products, and a new report by Web3 developer platform Alchemy shows that may already be happening.  The data shows the number of smart contracts deployed on Ethereum increased by more than 40% since the end of the first quarter, despite the price of ether falling about 60% since the start of 2022.  While decentralized finance (DeFi) total-value locked (TVL) has fallen 69% and non-fungible token (NFT) trading volume has fallen 88% from the third quarter of last year, the amount of Ethereum library installations have increased 178% in 2022.  Jason Shah, head of growth at Alchemy, told CoinDesk that the biggest takeaway from the data is that prices no longer serve as the only incentives to enter the space. Instead, developers are flocking to Web3 for the technological capabilities.  “I think the best representation of that is the fact that software developer kits (SDK) and smart contracts have more than doubled in their usage in the last year,” said Shah.  The data also shows that in September, 17,736 smart contracts were deployed – an all-time monthly high. Shah attributes this to the Ethereum Merge and an increased enthusiasm for building decentralized apps on the new proof-of-stake chain.  “It's definitely bringing a lot more developers into the space, a lot more brands, frankly, who are conscious of the environmental impact of proof-of-work,” said Shah.  Although this crypto winter has been touted as a good time to build Web3 products, it hasn’t been this way in previous bear markets. Alchemy’s data shows that the number of smart contracts deployed between 2018 and 2019 fell by 45%, while in 2022 so far that number has increased by 50% from last year.  Shah attributes this difference between bear markets to three key components: increased long-term conviction in the digital asset space, a larger number of Web3 educational resources and more advanced developer tools to encourage building in the space.  “As a result [of these components], there's no longer the same obstacles that people may have had that led them to lose a little bit of faith in 2019, which you see in the data,” said Shah.

42421246,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXhsIn,1665676197,'It’s Always the Community': Web3 and the Future of Movies,"Think about “Buffy the Vampire Slayer.” It was more than a show, it was one of the internet’s first cultural juggernauts: Fans obsessed in chat rooms, they wrote fan fiction, they organized conventions.  People did that for free. They did it because they loved Buffy and they wanted to be part of the world. In some ways they even expanded that universe, imbuing the Buffy “brand” – the intellectual property – with added value.  But what if fans could be rewarded for their work?  “Buffy was amazing television, but think about all of the fan communities around the show,” says Lindsey McInerney, CEO of Sixth Wall, a Web3 entertainment startup, and former head of technology and innovation at Anheuser-Busch InBev. “I think Web3 will give people an opportunity to participate in some of that in a much larger way.”  McInerney is presenting at Investing in Digital Enterprises and Assets Summit (I.D.E.A.S.), CoinDesk's newest event revealing the most scalable marketplaces in the digital economy. Learn directly from entrepreneurs in leading innovation across digital assets, Web3, blockchain and the metaverse. Register here.  “Buffy” had a rabid fan base because it was entertaining. And entertainment is a key part of McInerney’s thesis.  “Entertainment will bring the first 100 million, 500 million people to Web3,” McInerney says. That is one reason she co-founded Sixth Wall, along with the actresses Mila Kunis and Lisa Sterbakov and others. They are already cranking out content, including the NFT (non-fungible token)-injected animated “Stoner Cats,” which stars Kunis (along with a wild cast that includes actor Chris Rock and Ethereum blockchain co-founder Vitalik Buterin). Other content that was produced in partnership with animated studio Toonstar is “The Gimmicks,” a raunchy animated wrestling comedy that lets the community help tell the story (here’s my in-depth profile), as well as a “digi-physical” comic book series called “Armored Kingdom,” and soon an upcoming crypto trading card game.  Her mission? “Sixth Wall is really building the future of entertainment,” McInerney says, and she likes that this future can be co-owned by the community.  “It’s always the fandoms and the communities that make any IP what it is,” she says. “Whether it's Batman, whether it's Buffy, whether it’s Bored Ape. It’s always the community.”  For IDEAS week, she shares why she’s betting on Web3 culture and why it really does come down to fun and games.  “Entertainment is always the first reason people show up,” McInerney says. “As humans, we’re inherent storytellers, we're culture creators. It makes us who we are.”  This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  What is it about entertainment, specifically, that excites you about Web3?  When we moved from Web1 to Web2, what really drew people in was ways to entertain, and to be entertained, and to participate and hang with friends, right?  MySpace is a great example. You could provide the world with a version of your identity on the internet, and communicate who you were, and find other subcultures and groups that were like you. It made it really easy to share pictures and images. Web1 was really hard, right? You had to work to share something. Web2 became simple. You had Flickr, you had Blogger, Tumblr, Facebook, MySpace, YouTube. Those were the first big experiences of Web2.  Read more: Can Web3 Remake Hollywood?  Ask any investor, if they would love to have been an early, early investor in any of those companies, and they would say, ""Hell, yeah."" And guess what? That's what brought people to this next era of the internet and got people accustomed to the consumerization of software. The idea that software is so easy, it works like magic. That permitted the next era of companies – Airbnb, Uber, DoorDash, that kind of thing. It was the entertaining companies that opened the door for all these others.  Right. You couldn’t start with Uber.  Now if you think about Web3, if you think about the metaverse, the first experiences aren't going to be, like, ways to show up and do your taxes. That would be horrible. And I’m sorry if someone's building that, and I'm sure somebody is.  My belief is that entertainment will bring the first 100 million, 500 million people to Web3, to the metaverse, to the blockchain or whatever we wanna call it. Entertainment is always the first reason people show up. As humans, we’re inherent storytellers, we're culture creators. It makes us who we are.  How do you think traditional entertainment brands will embrace and harness Web3? Like, in theory, could Disney make a Web3 “Star Wars” project?  I like to think of it as joint upside. Because right now, it's such an unfair relationship, in some ways, between the fans and producers or creators. I think everybody's a creator, and especially fans.  Fans are some of the greatest creators. And it's a little bit of an unfair relationship when you have fans of “Star Wars” creating incredible side stories, and things that genuinely encourage the “Star Wars” community to become bigger and greater, and hungry for more things. It's an unfair relationship today. I think it's inevitable that we start to find ways to share upside with people in our fandoms, in our communities.  Read more: StoryDAO and the Quest to Recreate Hollywood  It's my core belief that some of the biggest brands of Web3 will be co-owned with the community, that they'll be co-created, that they'll be decentralized in some capacity. We're still trying to figure out what all that means, right? But we’ll find better and more rewarding ways to have relationships with the people who really help drive the success of a brand.  You’ve spoken before about how at Sixth Wall, there’s a strong emphasis on story. Always story, story, story. Why is this so paramount?  I am very biased, but I do think that the story side of things, and the entertainment side of things, is what makes our team truly special. You know, Mila [Kunis] has been working in entertainment her whole life, and Lisa [Sterbakov] pretty darn close. Our creators wake up, they live, breathe and die entertainment and story.  As humans we're storytellers and we're creators. So you have to make technology work its way into that, versus technology being the story itself. Steve Jobs’ keynotes weren’t exciting because he was talking about the tech, he was telling the story. And God, we all bought into his world and his vision and the future. Nothing works without stories. This is not a B2B situation. We're not selling databases and software. Everything has to be a story.  What do you see as the biggest challenges to making Web3-powered entertainment a mainstream reality?  I certainly can't speak for everybody. But for me, I think it’s figuring out what IP rights in this space can look like. What does it legally mean to own a thing on the blockchain, really? Because that's not getting contested yet, right? Nobody's had to really go to a court of law and figure out what it means to hold a CryptoPunks or a Bored Ape, and what they can do with it.  Let’s say that someone buys into all of this. They’re with you. They think that Web3 entertainment will be massive. How, specifically, do you make money off this concept? How do you monetize?  This is stuff that I think about every day. But candidly, I think we're probably a bit early to share exact ideas on that. But something this big doesn't come along without there being tremendous opportunity to make money. You know, there's going to be money flowing in and out of this space.  In the spirit of focusing on the entertainment, the story, and the tech, we’re just really focused on trying to make incredibly fun experiences and build great communities.  Fair enough! But what’s your main pitch for an investor? How do you entice them?  There's lots of different ways to look at this. But consider the McKinsey stat that the metaverse will be worth $5 trillion by 2030. And we believe entertainment will drive a lot of these primary and early experiences. That’s why you want to be talking to entertainment companies and people who are focused on the entertaining side of things right now.  Because when Facebook was released, it was a very nascent, silly idea to take pictures of your friends from the local yearbook and stick them on the internet. Like, what a silly and ridiculous thing, and here we are. It's always the entertaining experiences that land first. You want the teams with the biggest and deepest experiences in that space.

42394632,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASUgNS,1665675346,Janet Yellen Stresses Need for Central Bank Digital Currency Work,"Washington D.C. — U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Wednesday reiterated the importance of building a regulatory framework for digital assets, referencing Terra as one possible danger and the tether stablecoin's “breaking the buck” as a result of the crypto crash.  In a conversation at the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) annual meeting here, Yellen said that while there are more existing regulations “than people think” that can be applied to crypto, there are also many “holes” that need to be addressed.  Yellen said she would like to work with Congress to fill those holes as digital finance is “a tough thing to regulate,” she said.  As for a U.S. central bank digital currency, Yellen thinks a CBDC has advantages and the potential to solve many problems. While the process of creating a CBDC could take many years, it is “certainly worth getting involved in developing.”  “We can continue to think about whether it’s right to implement,” she said, but the U.S. should be “in a position where we could issue one.”  Last week, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), of which Yellen is a member along with Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell, among others, published a report asking Congress to step in to provide guidance on what should be the limits of securities regulation.

42421241,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXhsKr,1665675174,Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol Wants to Make Bitcoin a Climate-Positive Asset,"Addressing Bitcoin’s energy-intensive proof-of-work model would encourage greater institutional adoption, according to one chief executive who has focused on sustainability for more than eight years.  Bradford Van Voorhees, CEO and co-founder of Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol, told CoinDesk that negative media, misperceptions of Bitcoin’s environmental impact and its sizable energy consumption all currently hinder institutional adoption.  Bradford Van Voorhees is presenting at Investing in Digital Enterprises and Assets Summit (I.D.E.A.S.), CoinDesk's newest event revealing the most scalable marketplaces in the digital economy that will attract institutional capital in the years to come.  Learn directly from entrepreneurs in leading innovation across digital assets, Web3, blockchain and the metaverse. Register here.  “The problem with the Bitcoin network is that there’s lots of miners who are not using clean energy sources,” Voorhees said in an interview.  To address this problem, the Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol – which will be featured at CoinDesk’s IDEAS conference – introduced Sustainable Bitcoin Certificates, or SBCs, transferable assets that represent sustainably mined bitcoin.  The protocol mints and awards a single SBC to bitcoin miners, who have passed a renewable energy verification process, for each individual bitcoin (or sat) they mine sustainably. SBCs serve as the financial incentive for miners to use verified clean energy because they can sell SBCs to ESG-driven asset managers separately from the bitcoin they mine.  By purchasing SBCs, environmentally conscious companies can add “Proof of Sustainable Mining” to their bitcoin holdings, which means investors can benefit by holding BTC while simultaneously meeting their sustainability mandates.  The protocol, which is targeting the $12 billion renewable energy certificate market, aims to use the historically mined 19.17 million BTC to make it “our planet’s most powerful climate positive asset,” said Voorhees.  The protocol records Bitcoin’s current energy consumption from Cambridge University, purchases renewable energy certificates (REC), retires the number of RECs required for the energy consumption of one bitcoin to mint a single SBC and generates platform fees that are the spread of the cost of RECs and the market price of the SBCs.  “If we wanted to make SBCs for all 19 million bitcoins that exist today, it would require about $25 billion worth of RECs, and the entire REC market today is only $12 billion,” said Voorhees. “We would more than double the size of the renewable energy development market.”  Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol has multiple memorandum of understandings with several bitcoin miners including CleanSpark, Luxxfolio and BitDeer. Additionally, the protocol has raised $1.7 million in its from notable investors like partners from Goldman Sachs, Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu and BlackPine.  SBCs are not a tradable asset yet, but Voorhees says they’ll “likely trade for around 5% of the price of BTC, give or take.”  The project has yet to award its first Sustainable Bitcoin Certificate, but a pilot transaction is currently underway involving CleanSpark’s Georgia-located bitcoin mining operation, which is currently going through a renewable energy verification process.  “As this protocol takes off, there’s going to be substantial capital that’s driven into the renewable energy development market on behalf of Bitcoin. … This asset is our most powerful tool to fight climate change,” Voorhees said.  *Update on October 13, 2022 21:36:06 UTC: Clarified list of notable investors",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING,Sage D.

42393774,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpAndz,1665673777,TrueFi's $4M Bad Debt in Limbo Shows Risk of Crypto Lending Without Collateral,"The crypto bear market is teaching the still-in-its-infancy decentralized finance (DeFi) industry that banking can be a tough business.  On Oct. 9, TrueFi, a DeFi protocol where institutional investors can take out loans without collateral, issued a “notice of default” for the first time since its start in 2020. The borrower was Blockwater, a Korean crypto investment firm, which allegedly missed payment on a $3.4 million loan.  And that’s not the only troublesome loan on the protocol’s balance sheet. On the same day, TrueFi officials warned in a Twitter post that another borrower, Invictus Capital, might not repay a $1 million loan due Oct. 30; Invictus filed for voluntary liquidation earlier this summer.  TrueFi already is dealing with the fallout from the news last month that crypto market maker Wintermute fell into a precarious financial position after it lost $160 million in a hack. Wintermute is the single largest borrower on TrueFi with $92 million debt outstanding at press time, which is due to mature on Oct. 15. On Sept. 21, TrueFi said its “credit team has held multiple constructive discussions” with Wintermute, and that it could come up with a short-term loan if needed.  Unlike on DeFi protocols like Aave or Maker – where loans are secured by more assets than the loan’s value and a default prompts an automatic liquidation of the collateral – lenders on TrueFi have no other choice than to trust the protocol’s due diligence on borrowers taking out unsecured loans, because there’s no collateral to seize in a default.  “This is not too much different from the centralized model,” Dustin Teander, analyst at crypto intelligence platform Messari, told CoinDesk. “You kind of have to trust the people.""  TrueFi says its credit group ""believes that the loan book continues to remain in strong standing."" But the recent disclosures call into question the sustainability of the undercollateralized crypto lending business model and its level of decentralization. Borrowers and loans once deemed safe might be riskier than previously thought.  Bad crypto loans  Decentralized finance is a novel concept – enabled by fast-developing blockchain technology – that attempts to create a banking system without the need for bureaucracy and trust in the middlemen by deploying computer-coded smart contracts.  This year, automated DeFi lending protocols including Maker and Aave stood out by weathering the crypto market crash – even as several centralized crypto lenders, such as Celsius Network and Voyager Digital, became insolvent after making risky loans with customer deposits to crypto firms. The DeFi platforms’ requirement of ample collateral proved crucial in their ability to avoid losses.  TrueFi is one of the most prominent practitioners of undercollateralized lending in DeFi. The protocol, backed by big-time crypto investors such as Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and Alameda Research, creates lending pools where any investor can deposit crypto to earn yield; professional investors – ostensibly reputable crypto firms – comprise the bulk of borrowers; they can take out loans, at interest.  These loans are uncollateralized, meaning that borrowers do not pledge any of their own assets to secure the loan. The likelihood of the loan getting repaid is based on the protocol’s review of the borrowers’ creditworthiness – essentially an article of faith.  Hence, would-be borrowers have to go through TrueFi’s credit and know-your-customer (KYC) checks and pass the capital requirements to apply for a loan. Those who hold TRU, the platform’s governance token, vote to approve or deny the application.  ""Defaults are ordinary course in this asset class and critically important to refining risk parameters and pricing over time,"" Roshan Dharia, head of lending at Archblock, a core TrueFi contributor which oversees borrower relationships on the protocol, told CoinDesk. ""We have historically been heavily focused on borrower counterparty risk, asset composition and liquidity profile. These diligence items remain the highest priority as we face continued macro headwinds and a protracted bear market.""  TRU’s price dropped 15% in digital-asset markets since Blockwater’s default, though the decline was mostly in sync with a retreat in broader crypto markets. Currently, the token trades at 4.4 cents, close to an all-time low and down 90% over the past year, according to data by crypto price tracker CoinGecko.  Centralized solutions for DeFi’s problems  Undercollateralized lenders like TrueFi made loans when crypto prices and yields were high; it’s sort of like when subprime mortgage lenders issued oodles of loans during the home-price boom of the mid-2000s – just before the housing market crashed.  Experiencing the bear market for the first time, these crypto lenders have had to adjust to a new reality, where yields are lower but with bigger perceived risks. Yields in crypto lending depend on trading volumes rather than risks and central bank-set interest rates, and trading volumes on exchanges declined after a lot of traders left the market.  “It’s really hard to make long-term loans in a volatile market and expect a consistent payback,” Messari's Teander said. “I think the undercollateralized lending model is going to stick around,” but “folks have to improve the pricing of the risks.”  TrueFi, in anticipation of a non-zero amount of loan defaults, built in a “default protection” as a backstop insurance for lenders. The protocol slashes up to 10% of all staked (locked up) TRU tokens to compensate affected lenders.  The default protection, however, currently stands at $1.36 million, TrueFi’s dashboard shows. That’s only about a third of the outstanding bad debt on the platform, not enough to make lenders whole.  The process is not automatic, and the resolution of the Blockwater loan is “working its way through the internal checks,” Michael Bland, a senior counsel of Archblock, told CoinDesk.  Lenders seeking to recover their assets fully are left with traditional recourse, not automated at all – hoping that the protocol can negotiate with borrowers to restructure and repay the bad debt or go to court to liquidate the assets to get them back. Legal fees can add up.  According to a TrueFi blog post about the default notice on the Blockwater debt, “a potential court-supervised administrative proceeding would lead to a better outcome for stakeholders given the complexity around the sudden insolvency.”  Possible loan losses  If history is any indication, depositors of the TrueFi lending pool may have to stomach losses.  Maple Finance, a rival undercollateralized DeFi lending protocol, had reported on June 21 that it might face short-term liquidity challenges and have insufficient cash after Babel Finance, a crypto lending firm, became insolvent and defaulted on a $10 million loan. After liquidating the loan, depositors of the lending pool suffered $7.9 million in losses, which represented a 3.2% haircut on the $244 million total deposits in the pool.  TrueFi's $4 million bad debt represents a fraction of the $117 million loans outstanding. What may worry lenders is that the bad loans to Blockwater and Invictus are both from the same lending pool potentially nonperforming loans represent almost half of the pool's $8.4 million in assets.  TrueFi's credit team added in a tweet that “as result of active negotiations expected recovery value will be maximized on these distressed loans.”  What comes next is that TRU token holders, who govern the protocol, will discuss and vote on how to proceed with recovering the assets to mitigate the hit on lenders affected by the default.  How long that could take and how much assets could be recovered remains an open question.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | TUSD,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/13/truefis-4m-bad-debt-in-limbo-shows-risk-of-crypto-lending-without-collateral,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a435f31d2258322cacff796f77ba8ab6180dd9a4-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Headline inflation was 8.2%, also topping economist forecasts.  The news sent bitcoin (BTC) tumbling to $18,100 – not far off from its 2022 low of $17,600. At press time, the price has bounced modestly to $18,400. The major U.S. stock market averages all fell more than 2%, but are currently trying to mount a mid-morning bounce, with the S&P 500 narrowing its decline to just 1%.  Among the mining stocks, Marathon Digital (MARA) is trading lower by 7%, with Riot Blockchain (RIOT) and Core Scientific (CORZ) down similar amounts. U.K. miner Argo Blockchain (ARBK) continued to underperform the rest of the sector, down 16.5% to add to its losses following last week's decision to raise capital.  In an Oct. 12 research note, Roth Capital analyst Darren Aftahi downgraded his recommendation on Argo to neutral from buy, with a $2 price target. While Argo has taken steps to stabilize its balance sheet, wrote Aftahi, growth will become limited and the company may begin to lose market share versus other miners. Rising power costs alongside stagnant bitcoin prices are also a headwind for the company's margins, he said.  MicroStrategy (MSTR), the company that holds 130,000 BTC ($2.4 billion worth, and falling), is lower by 6.7%, while crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) is down 11.5%.

Hickenlooper said the current lack of a coordinated regulatory framework leads ""uneven enforcement"" and hinders clear understanding of investor protection in a letter to Gensler first published by Punchbowl News  ""At the same time, as you have repeatedly noted, existing securities regulation does not cleanly apply,"" he said. ""Applying the old rules to the new market could inadvertently cause financial services to be more expensive, less accessible, and the SEC’s disclosure regime to be less useful to the American people.""  Hickenlooper called for the SEC to take action in clarifying which digital assets are securities, how they should be issued and listed as such, determine what disclosures are necessary to inform investors, establish a registration regime for trading platforms and set rules for how trading and custody should be carried out.  Gensler and the SEC's approach to crypto has drawn criticism from political classes previously but generally from the other side of the aisle. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), for example, attacked the regulator for the lack of regulatory action which could have prevented the worst effects of the collapse of several crypto companies, such as Celsius Network.

The goal of the product, which is called Dubbed FalconX 360, is to combine liquidity, visibility and risk management.  Fragmentation across crypto trading platforms and exchanges creates challenges for clients who cannot get a unified look at their assets and liabilities, Samir Ghosh, FalconX’s head of product, told CoinDesk.  FalconX 360 gives clients “turnkey access to 94% of global spot and derivatives liquidity through one account and one platform,” Ghosh said.  Additional components of the new platform include access pricing from more than 70 liquidity venues with built-in smart order routing, treasury management, risk management and operations.

42394629,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASUgJW,1665667799,Police Complaints in This Indian District Are Going on the Polygon Blockchain,"Police in the Firozabad district of India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, have announced an initiative that will put public complaints on a blockchain.  The project is the first of its kind in India and is powered by Polygon, a scaling tool looking to facilitate lower-cost crypto transactions and uses the Ethereum blockchain. The portal, called ""police complaint on blockchain,"" will not charge users to file grievances or complaints and accommodates both Hindi and English languages. Complainants can check on the status of the case, know who the assigned officer is and get alerts on the progress of a complaint.  India has a historically messy process for registering police complaints marred by corruption, bureaucratic delays, and retractions by complainants themselves. Officers are known to cut their caseloads by refusing to register crime complaints, and there have been instances where complainants were either forced or intimidated into altering their original complaints. India has more than 40 million pending court cases thanks in part to delays fueled by the coronavirus pandemic.  ""Now, once the complaint has been filed, it cannot be removed or changed, it will be immutable,"" said Ashish Tiwari, senior superintendent of police, Firozabad Police. ""We felt the need for this technology. Police stations in the area will have QR codes to scan to complete the form to register a complaint.""  The portal was put together by Ankur Rakhi Sinha, the founder of AirChains, a Web3 software development platform, with the support of the police district's smart cell, which is a group of personnel within police departments equipped and acquainted with the latest technology to fight crime.  ""This is very close to my heart,"" tweeted Polygon's co-founder Sandeep Nailwal. ""We grow up hearing about so many of such cases wherein due to some corruption in a local police department, victims (mostly of rapes) are not even able to register complaints or the complaints being manipulated. This could be a game-changer in ensuring right to justice,"" he added.  In India, after a complaint is filed, a First Information Report (FIR) is prepared by the police if they determine an official investigation is required. All complaints filed will go on the blockchain but not every complaint will progress into an FIR.  “Every complaint will be assessed and if it is feasible then an FIR will be registered,"" Tiwari told CoinDesk, adding that the police will decide if an investigation is warranted within seven days of the complaint being filed.  Similar projects are in the pipeline in other states of India including Delhi, West Bengal, Assam and Chhattisgarh, according to a local news report.  Officials in India have also introduced blockchain “caste certificates” to up to 65,000 tribal members in a remote region in an attempt to stop fraudulent claims on government benefits for the disadvantaged.

42394634,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASUgOR,1665665509,Bitcoin Sinks After US CPI Report Shows Inflation Hotter Than Expected,"U.S. consumer prices in September slowed from the prior month, the Labor Department reported Thursday, but the inflation rate was still faster than what economists had predicted.  Bitcoin (BTC) tumbled nearly 3% in the minutes after the report to its lowest level since Sept. 21. As of press time, the largest cryptocurrency by market value was changing hands at around $18,400. Crypto traders track monthly inflation figures closely, because the Federal Reserve’s efforts to temper soaring inflation have pushed down prices for financial assets seen as risky, from stocks to bitcoin.  Update: Bitcoin Rebounds to Over $19K After Plunge Triggered by Hot Inflation Report  The Consumer Price Index report – the most widely watched gauge to track inflationary pressure in the U.S. – rose 8.2% in September from the same month a year ago, slightly higher than the 8.1% forecasted by economists. The index rose 0.4% from August.  The ""core"" CPI, which strips out volatile energy and food prices and is more closely watched by investors and policymakers because it’s seen as a more steady indicator of underlying price pressures, rose 0.6%, the same pace as it rose in August, well exceeding expectations. The core CPI rose 6.6% from a year ago to its highest level in four decades.  Inflation Whac-A-Mole  When some prices fall, others rise. While the price of gas, which was the main driver for high inflation in recent months, cooled off further, prices for other items offset price decreases and kept overall inflation at a high level.  Health insurance, for example, was up 28% year over year, which is the largest increase ever. Similarly, groceries were 13% more expensive than a year ago and rent prices surged 7.2%, the highest in four decades.  And even though gas prices slightly fell in September, economists expect energy to pick up again in coming months as to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries announced it would cut production by 2 million barrels a day, which might drive up prices again.  Investors should be attentive to “continued divergence in direction between headline and core measures as compared to prior periods,” Michael Weisz, president of Yieldstreet, said. “Core categories, such as housing costs, tend to be ‘stickier’ in terms of price movements, and can give insight into future inflation expectations.”  Central bankers have raised interest rates five times this year so far, by a total of 300 basis points, or 3 percentage points, in an effort to bring inflation down to 2%, but they have a long way to go. In a survey conducted by Bankrate, 43% of economists said they think that inflation hasn’t peaked yet and will be more significant over the next 12 to 18 months.  According to the minutes from the September meeting of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, which were released on Wednesday, central bankers indicated that they expect rates to be high until prices come down sharply.  “They had raised their assessment of the path of the federal funds rate that would likely be needed to achieve the committee’s goals,” according to the document, with inflation “showing little sign so far of abating.”  Bitcoin, which has fallen dramatically this year, could stay under pressure as traders fret over the prospect of further steep interest-rate hikes by the Federal Reserve on Nov. 1-2, when the FOMC meets next.

42411333,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNE2o,1665665100,Investors Wanting to Outsource Crypto Portfolio Management Have Options,"The knowledge required to manage a crypto portfolio is much different than what is required to manage a portfolio of traditional investments like stocks and bonds.  Although people recognize the potential disruption that cryptocurrency and blockchain technology may have on various industries and are optimistic about the future of the industry, many of them do not understand how to invest in it and allocate a portion of their overall portfolio to it.  It’s no secret that crypto is a complex market, much different than traditional markets, which makes it challenging for individuals new to the space. For example, cryptocurrencies have their own jargon and lingo. There are many things found in crypto that do not exist in traditional securities, including tokenomics, 24/7 markets, hard and soft forks, airdrops, language barriers, technological security issues, etc. And some crypto assets are layer 1 blockchains, while others are tokens associated with layer 2 protocols.  As a result, many investors are discouraged by the tremendous learning curve that must be mastered in order to properly build a portfolio of cryptocurrencies and tokens. The good news is that these investors can outsource the management of their crypto portfolio – just like they can traditional assets. By doing so, they are able to achieve an exposure to the asset class while avoiding the difficult task of managing the portfolio.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  Outsourcing portfolio management  Outsourcing investment management is not a new concept. Individuals have been doing exactly this in traditional markets for a long time. Investors in traditional markets can outsource stock and bond management by using mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The mutual fund and ETF market is quite large – and rapidly growing.  These products have fund managers that select securities based on the goal of the fund. For example, if an individual wishes to invest in US large cap stocks, they can either purchase and manage the individual stocks or they can buy a US large cap stock fund, pay a small fee to the fund manager, and outsource the management. Many investors use funds in their portfolios and have used these products for a long time.  Beyond this, some investors do not wish to even select funds in their portfolio, so they outsource fund selection to financial advisors and financial planners. Financial advisors build and manage portfolios for individuals based on their specific situations. Advisors may select funds and investment strategies for their clients, and in doing so the client is able to outsource nearly all parts of their investing to professionals.  Read more: 7 Key Ways to Evaluate a Cryptocurrency Before Buying It  Outsourcing crypto portfolio management  While fund strategies and advisors are a popular solution in traditional markets, these concepts are still new in the crypto world. However, some select financial advisors offer cryptocurrency management, similar to what they offer for traditional financial portfolios.  When an investor wishes to outsource their crypto portfolio management to an advisor, the advisor will perform all the research, crypto selection and management on behalf of their client. In this situation, the client has their own account with a crypto exchange and custodian like Gemini or Coinbase, and the advisor has the ability to manage the account on their behalf.  It is important to note that the client owns the account and the underlying assets in the account, and that the advisor simply has authority to manage the holdings within the account. This strategy is often called a “Separately Managed Account” or SMA.  SMAs offer a unique solution for clients, which allows the client to hold their own cryptocurrencies in their own account. Advisors usually charge a 1-2% fee on the assets they manage on behalf of their clients. These SMA accounts are not yet offered by the traditional custodians like Fidelity or TD Ameritrade, although Fidelity has announced crypto custody and trading services.

In a hedge fund, all investor capital is pooled together and managed in a general account by the hedge fund traders and portfolio managers.  Hedge funds allow investors to gain exposure to the crypto asset class and hedge funds also have the ability to not only buy coins and tokens that are offered on crypto exchanges, but they can also take advantage of on-chain opportunities like DeFi and other opportunities that are discovered by the manager of the fund.  On the downside, although hedge funds are flexible and can provide a great opportunity to investors, they are often more expensive than using a crypto-specific SMA strategy. The common fees in crypto hedge funds are a 2% annual fee and a 20% fee on the profits generated.  Read more: 3 Ways Traditional Investors Can Gain Crypto Exposure  Crypto ETFs and mutual funds still in limbo  Mutual Funds and ETFs that hold crypto directly do not yet exist. The US Securities and Exchange commission has repeatedly denied applications from investment companies to offer a crypto ETF.  While mutual funds and ETFs present a simple solution for many investors in traditional markets, the SEC has been vocal about their concerns with approving a crypto-based fund to exist in the US public markets.  Read more: Everything You Need to Know About Bitcoin ETFs  The crypto industry is pushing back on the SEC’s denial of crypto ETFs. Recently, Grayscale, a large crypto-focused investment firm, sued the SEC when their request to convert from a trust to an ETF was denied in the summer of 2022. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) currently has over $12 billion in assets under management (AUM). GBTC trades “over the counter” on public exchanges and many investors are able to purchase the asset in their traditional brokerage accounts.  Many people have pointed out that traditional investors are very interested in purchasing publicly traded crypto products, noting that to the size of GBTC’s AUM is evidence of investor appetite and interest in crypto. If a crypto-focused ETF or mutual fund were approved by the SEC, there are many investors that would prefer the simplicity of purchasing that type of fund directly in their already-existing investment accounts.  More crypto investment options underway  Options for professional crypto management are still limited, especially when compared to the options in the traditional markets.  However, while the market for professionally managed crypto accounts is still maturing, desire from traditional investors to invest in crypto is evident.  Fortunately, these investors have the ability to hire a financial advisor to manage a crypto portfolio for them via an SMA or may choose to allocate to a crypto-specific fund.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | FORKS,Jackson Wood,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/10/13/investors-wanting-to-outsource-crypto-portfolio-management-have-options,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/505b41cb84fe757575993d989be43fbb92d662ce-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Merge created the transition from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Unfortunately, the post-Merge events brought deflationary situations for the blockchain. As predicted by some crypto experts, the price of Ethereum has dropped drastically following its transition to PoS. Also, the dynamics of ETH supply have changed after the upgrade. Related Reading: Crypto Market Shows No Signs Of Positive Movement, Is &apos;Uptober&apos; A Myth? According to data from Ultrasound Money, there&apos;s a reduction in the daily amount of ETH that hit the market. Furthermore, the data revealed that the declining record was about 90% after the Merge. This change could be because Ether is no longer mined since it&apos;s now a PoS network. Burning Mechanism Reduces Ethereum Supply A careful study of Ethereum supply indicated a reduction over the past five days. With such a trend, the total supply for the second largest crypto asset plunged by about 5,500 ETHs since October 8. The decline is linked to the implication of EIP-1559 and the burning mechanism for the token. This ensures that a percentage of fees paid for ETH transactions is burned. Before the transition to PoS, miners receive about 13,000 ETH from the Ethereum network as rewards. The network makes payments daily to secure the ecosystem and for processing transactions.

42394636,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASUgRO,1665662528,Ether Exits Triangular Price Consolidation With 4% Drop,"Ether (ETH) is facing selling pressure ahead of the U.S. inflation report that could offer clues on whether the Federal Reserve has the room to slow liquidity tightening.  The Ethereum blockchain's native token dropped 4% to $1,220 on Thursday, exiting a three-week-long triangular consolidation pattern called a ""pennant,"" as the feature image sourced from TradingView shows.  The so-called pennant breakdown has bearish implications, according to Goncalo Moreira, a chartered market technician. Pennants represent brief consolidation after a notable rally or decline and usually pave the way for a continuation of the preceding trend.  Ether's pennant breakdown has opened the doors for a deeper decline, and the bears may capitalize on the same if the U.S. Consumer Price Index comes in hotter than expected.  According to Moreira, however, the ensuring sell-off may be short-lived, with bargain hunters taking advantage of cheaper valuations.  ""The good thing is that ether is nearing buyers' territory,"" Moreira told CoinDesk. ""If we extend the lower border of the pennant pattern to the left on a log-scale weekly chart, the extended trendline corresponds with the June low and the March 2020 low.""  The lower border of the pennant is represented by a trendline connecting the Sept. 21 and Oct 3 lows.  A logarithmic scale chart plots values between two points according to the percent change rather than the absolute change and is suitable for data with vast value disparity. For instance, ether has gone from being valued in two digits in March 2020 to four digits at press time. Technical analysts often use log charts to analyze long-term trends.  The pennant breakdown would become irrelevant if the U.S. data shows inflation cooled notably in September. That might revive hopes of a Fed pivot, bringing relief to risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.

Although fundraising efforts have seen success over the last three years, Keith A. Grossman, Time president and New York Cares board member, told CoinDesk he’s not only passionate about raising money for underprivileged students, but also about implementing technologies to propel a new wave of philanthropic efforts.  “In Web3, there is a desire and an intent for people to show that the space has tremendous good in it. Doing something like this is the best example to highlight the good,” said Grossman.  The collection will feature over 16,000 digital pieces created by Open AI’s DALL-E. Each artificial intelligence-generated piece is inspired by different Winston Churchill quotes that are interpreted in the style of 13 artists including Andy Warhol, Frida Kahlo and Jean-Michel Basquiat.  Individuals who previously signed up for Grossman’s “About Nothing” allow list can now mint digital artworks that are priced at 0.05 ETH (about $65) each. The site will be open to the public on Friday at midnight ET, and will close Sunday at noon.  Additionally, users who mint over five NFTs will receive a digital piece from artist Pablo Stanley’s Humankind collection, and those who mint more than 10 will receive a digital collectible from Micah Johnson, the artist behind the Aku World NFT collection.  All of the proceeds from the first and secondary sales will go towards bolstering academic programs, providing school supplies and enrichment programs throughout New York City.  New York City Department of Education Chancellor David C. Banks said in a press release that he is ready to embrace new technology to uplift over 1 million students across the roughly 2,000 schools he oversees.  “To ensure a bright future for our young people, we must collaboratively take a technologically driven approach to supporting our schools and our young people,” said Banks.  Several other efforts have also used NFTs as a philanthropy tool. In March, the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine created an NFT museum to digitize and reflect on moments from the Russian invasion, with proceeds donated to Ukrainian efforts. In October 2021, a high school student released a Solana-based NFT collection to raise money for Beluga whale conservation as well as children’s hospital funds.

This year, transaction volume in China's e-CNY has increased by 14% from the 87.6 billion yuan ($12 billion) recorded at the end of 2021, which is a big decrease when compared to the 154% growth seen between June and December of last year.  The PBOC did not provide an update on the number of e-CNY wallets opened, which reached 261 million at of the end of 2021, the report said.  The 100 billion yuan figure is also dwarfed by the volumes recorded by the country's top payment providers such as Tencent's WeChat Pay and Ant Group's Alipay. The latter, for example, processed payments worth 118 trillion yuan ($16.4 trillion) in the 12 months ending in June 2021, according to the SCMP's report. Ant Group is the fintech affiliate of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which also owns the SCMP.

It became deflationary as more ether was burned verifying transactions than was created in the same period, which led to a reduction of 0.13% in supply over the last week, equivalent to about 4,000 tokens, the note said.  The rate of new ether creation has fallen by nearly 90% since the Merge, the note added.  CoinDesk Special Coverage: The Ethereum Merge  The Merge was the first of five upgrades planned for the Ethereum blockchain and involved the transition to a more energy-efficient PoS consensus mechanism.  Some argued that a drop in the supply of ether should have resulted in higher prices (assuming demand stays constant), but Coinbase noted that the price of the cryptocurrency has fallen about 4% in the last week.  An Ethereum-based token project called XEN triggered ether’s deflationary burn rate when it fueled a large spike in network traffic last weekend, the report said.

Fair-value accounting of crypto would allow companies to report losses and gains immediately and treat the asset class as traditional financial assets. Currently, digital assets are considered as indefinite-lived intangible assets that only require reporting once a year.  In May, the FASB unanimously voted to review accounting rules for crypto following pressure from the likes of former MicroStrategy (MSTR) CEO Michael Saylor, who said that current rules discourage companies from holding bitcoin on their balance sheets.  Saylor tweeted his support for the new accounting system, calling it a major milestone on the road to institutional bitcoin adoption.  MicroStrategy currently holds 130,000 bitcoin valued at $2.47 billion, with the position at an unrealized loss of $1.51 billion.  “We expect the disconnect between the reported carrying value on our balance sheet and the fair market value of our bitcoin holdings to grow significantly over time,” MicrosStrategy CEO Phong Le said in a letter to the FASB last year, as quoted by WSJ.

42394620,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASUgBe,1665653760,Digital Asset Bank Custodia Files Petition in US Court Over BNY Mellon's Crypto Approval,"Digital assets bank Custodia Bank has filed a petition in a U.S. court in Wyoming over what it calls ""favoritism"" and a ""lack of respect"" by the Board of Directors of the Kansas City Fed in allowing BNY Mellon (BK) to engage in crypto custody but not granting Custodia approval for a Fed master account.  Custodia, which was formerly known as Avanti Bank, said it has been waiting for 19 months to hear back from the Fed on its approval for a master account. Master accounts would allow Custodia to deposit funds with the Fed and be connected directly to the global financial system.  By virtue of being a well-established bank, BNY would have a master account with the Fed. The bank announced on Tuesday it would allow certain institutional clients access to the new service.  Without a master account, institutions like Custodia would need to use an intermediary bank and be subject to that bank's rules, regulations, and fee structure. In June, Custodia filed suit against the Fed alleging that the U.S. central bank was unlawfully delaying its application and has the support of a number of Republican lawmakers.  “Last week, the Federal Reserve told a federal judge that keeping custody of digital assets, like bitcoin, posed a ‘novel, precedent-setting risk.’ This week, the Fed allowed BNY Mellon to do the exact same thing. So it has one rule for innovators like Custodia Bank, and another for the nation’s oldest bank,” said Nathan Miller, a spokesperson for Custodia Bank, in an email to CoinDesk. “After waiting more than 24 months, we are seeking nothing more than fair and equal treatment.”  For its part, the Fed has argued that granting master accounts to banks that provide custodial services for digital assets poses risks to the global financial system and thus it needs additional time to evaluate their applications fully. In August, the Fed published its final guidance for master account access which involves multiple tiers of access.  In its petition, Custodia said that BNY's approval ""directly refutes the central argument advanced by [the Fed].""  ""If holding custody of digital assets poses “novel, precedent-setting risk” to the United States financial system, as defendants suggest in their motions, then the board could have – indeed, should have – prevented BNY from engaging in such activities, especially since BNY is a global systematically important bank,"" Custodia argued.  Custodia is not seeking any sort of relief from the Court, only for it to examine a press release from BNY Mellon announcing its digital asset custody platform. The petition is part of the ongoing suit.  CORRECTION (Oct. 13, 2022, 21:40 UTC): Amends headline to clarify Wednesday's filing is part of an ongoing lawsuit, and not a new legal action.

The native coin of China's once-popular crypto exchange Huobi Global has rallied over 70% since Monday, reaching a four-month high of $7.60, according to data sourced from charting platform TradingView.  Considering the broader market lull and lingering macroeconomic uncertainty, that's an impressive performance. And it has put HT on the pedestal as the best-performing above $1 billion market cap cryptocurrency of the past seven days.  The token has decoupled from the broader market, seemingly on optimism that it will play a central role in a plan to revitalize the Huobi exchange.  ""We know that the key to revitalizing Huobi is to empower HT, and HT can only thrive on Huobi,"" Tron's founder Justin Sun tweeted Monday, announcing his membership on Huobi's global advisory board. ""In the future, there will be many big moves around HT, including brand upgrade, heavy empowerment, and business cooperation.""  During an appearance on Tuesday on CoinDesk's ""First Mover"" show, Sun said the HT token is central to Huobi's success, drawing parallels with Binance coin's (BNB) pivotal role in establishing Binance as the leading cryptocurrency exchange.  ""The success of BNB really benefits the Binance platform. So, I think in terms of operations, we need to focus on HT,"" Sun said.  Additionally, the change of management and fresh capital infusion looks to have given wings to the battered HT token, which remains 81.77% down from its all-time high set in May, 2021.  Last Friday, the exchange announced it has agreed to sell its entire shareholding to Hong Kong-based About Capital Management. The news came after months of speculation that founder Leon Li was looking to sell his 60% stake in the exchange for at least $1 billion.  The 2013-founded Huobi ran into a rough patch last year after China put a blanket ban on cryptocurrencies, taking a significant chunk of users away from the exchange. The exchange was reportedly mulling a 30% reduction in staff early this year to mitigate the loss in revenue due to the China crackdown.  Huobi, however, is confident about its prospects.  ""Under new ownership, the exchange is plotting an international expansion and will receive an injection of sufficient capital in margin and risk provision fund,"" the official announcement said.  Ted Chen, the CEO of About Capital Management, called the Huobi acquisition a significant milestone for the industry, saying the exchange is still in its early stage of development and there remains tremendous room for growth.

Data pointed out by Chainalysis on Thursday noted the amount was stolen from several decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols across 11 different attacks.  This year “will likely surpass 2021 as the biggest year for hacking on record,” Chainalysis researchers wrote. “So far, hackers have grossed over $3 billion across 125 hacks.”  ""Despite the current bear market, we’re seeing a lot of activity among hackers, who are targeting various protocols,"" said Jasper Lee, audit tech lead at crypto auditing firm Sooho.io.  ""For those protocols or dapps [decentralized apps] which have not been thoroughly audited, they make for easy and reliable short-term profit. Poorly protected protocols are low-hanging fruit for hackers, who make easy pickings of their too-easily accessed locked,"" Lee added.  Attackers gained over $3.2 billion in 2021. But 2022 was off to an even-rocky start with a $325 million exploit of popular cross-chain service Wormhole, which was followed by a $625 million attack on Axie Infinity’s Ronin bridge, and then a $200 million exploit of the Nomad bridge.  Attack vectors in the crypto sector range from exploiting bridges, a blockchain-based tool that allows users to transact between different networks, to market manipulation, where rogue traders utilize millions of dollars to move thinly traded markets in their favor to net several multiples of the initial capital deployed.  Over three bridges were breached this month alone, Chainalysis said, with an attack on a BNB Chain-based bridge over the weekend saw exploiters illicitly gaining over $100 million after the bridge was exploited for $566 million. Then, on Monday, the layer 1 blockchain QANplatform was the target of a bridge hack that resulted in the theft of nearly $1 million in QANX tokens.

42394032,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69buO3aN,1665648012,UK Lawmaker Matt Hancock Doesn’t Regret Pro-Crypto Swerve,"Matt Hancock hasn’t always backed the right horse – but he has no regrets about his support for crypto in spite of the recent market downturn, the British lawmaker told CoinDesk.  Hancock – who served as health minister during the COVID-19 pandemic during the Boris Johnson administration until he was caught in a lockdown-busting embrace with a female aide – swiveled to crypto advocacy around the beginning of this year.  A backbench member of Parliament from the ruling Conservative Party, Hancock is now one of the most high-profile crypto lobbyists in British politics – with an insight into the government’s thinking as it steers through crucial digital asset laws.  Hancock supported pro-crypto Finance Minister Rishi Sunak over eventual winner Liz Truss in the recent Conservative Party leadership contest. Hancock attempted to replace Theresa May as prime minister back in 2019, but pulled out of the contest that Johnson eventually won.  Despite 2022’s hiccups in crypto markets, Hancock, still a lawmaker, is no less convinced by the power of digital assets to improve financial services.  “There are endless killer applications that are coming into focus right now,” he told CoinDesk in an online interview – though he concedes that digital asset markets are more mature than the wider Web3 ecosystem.  “This is a massive revolution that's going to disrupt finance, in the same way that the digital revolution has disrupted music and retail and media – and nobody was explaining it,” he said.  Turmoil this year, including a fall in the price of major assets including bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), and the implosion of algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD, have only made crypto easier to lobby for, he said.  “My takeout from the market noise of the last six months or so is that the fundamentals are strong,” Hancock said. “This isn't about bitcoin. This is about a disruption much deeper … giving people more control over how they manage their affairs.”  Read more: Johnson's Exit as British Prime Minister Leaves UK Crypto Ambitions on Hold  “When the market is going up, heads are turned by the easy returns,” he said. “There's a much more substantial case to be made when the market is tricky … it isn't just a ‘get-rich-quick’ scheme.”  Kwarteng  Chief among people to influence is Kwasi Kwarteng, named finance minister by Truss on Sept. 6. Hancock admits Kwarteng has a lot on his plate; unfunded tax cuts the minister announced on Sept. 23 sent gilt and foreign exchange markets into a tailspin.  But with the new government focused on boosting growth, Hancock said he “fully expects” crypto to be the centerpiece of financial service reforms.  Kwarteng was “very, very positive” about crypto at a recent private meeting, Hancock said. “He gets the point of the disruptive power of digital assets and, crucially, that the U.K. has to be a natural home … I couldn't have been more pleased with the direction of travel.”  Competitive spirit adds fuel to the fire. The European Union, which the U.K. has left, is now finalizing its own crypto law known as MiCA; in Paris, President Emmanuel Macron is aggressively courting innovative firms such as Binance and crypto.com.  “There's nothing like a bit of Anglo-French rivalry to get British politicians on side,” Hancock said. “What's the point in Brexit if we're not going to make ourselves a more attractive regime than our continental neighbors?”  It’s been a turbulent few months in British politics. Mass resignations from Boris Johnson’s government in July were followed by a leadership contest to replace him, and then by the death of Queen Elizabeth – all leaving little time for policy tinkering. The industry is crying out for the government to act.  “A lot of the stuff that is set in train does need to be finalized,” said Andrew Whitworth, a policy director for crypto company Ripple who’s based in London, during an online interview. “We can't just trickle on, we do need this clarity.”  Whitworth took comfort from pro-crypto remarks from financial minister Richard Fuller made after Truss took office, but is still hoping for higher profile support from the government in the coming months.  Read more: Crypto Remains a Priority for UK Under New Leader, Drawing Industry Excitement  Hancock himself certainly has a few ideas for what changes need to happen – and isn’t satisfied with existing legislative plans initiated by Sunak back in April.  “The Financial Services and Markets Bill that's in front of Parliament now is, in my view, essentially a placeholder, it shows intent,” Hancock said – warning that he will get involved if the government itself doesn’t intervene in the coming weeks to, as he puts it, get the details right.  Hancock wants to switch the burden of proof so that “the regulator has to show that there's a problem,” rather than the current situation where startups must seek “permission” from the Financial Conduct Authority before they can even get going.  “I want people to be able to build, and only get involved with the regulator when [or] if there's a genuine problem,” he said.  Alongside changing the FCA’s “demeanor,” Hancock wants to see clarity on how existing rules apply to crypto, tax tweaks and a more favorable capital treatment for crypto to encourage traditional finance players in.  Turbulence  Achieving Hancock’s goal, and Whitworth’s, would rely on a calming of recent political turbulence. Though in principle the next election won’t be called before 2025, current polls seem to suggest a landslide for the opposition Labour Party – from which, Hancock says, there is less crypto enthusiasm.  “I don't think it [crypto] is particularly party political,” he said, “But I do think there are more people who get this on our side of the fence … the center-right of politics looks more for freedom.”  A spokesperson for the Labour Party did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment on Hancock’s remarks – but the evidence does seem to be that, indeed, the center-left opposition grouping is more crypto-skeptic.  “Many are rightly questioning whether crypto has a future at all,” Labour Party Treasury spokesperson Abena Oppong-Asare said during a Sept. 7 parliamentary debate, adding that the country had become a “center for illicit crypto activity” and that Russian oligarchs had used crypto to avoid western sanctions.  “A Labour government would be serious about attracting fintech companies to the U.K. and safely harnessing the progressive potential of blockchain technology,” Oppong-Asare said. “To do that properly, we need thorough and thoughtful regulation of the sector.”  There’s an app for that  Crypto isn’t Hancock’s first foray into online innovation: As minister responsible for digital policy back in 2018, he released his own social media app, named after himself. Intended to prove online discourse can be civil, he still seems rather proud of it.  “It became a really friendly, if slightly self-mocking, place... I'm fully aware of the many memes that it's sparked,” he said. “I post on it pretty regularly, about constituency stuff, generally.”  You can still download Matt Hancock from the Appstore, and recent posts on local issues such as hospital expansions and canceled bus routes have attracted a couple of likes each. Will there be a Web3 version, CoinDesk asked?  “No,” he said. “The technology's not mature enough yet.”  UPDATE (Oct. 13, 2022, 10:16 UTC): Amends reference to leadership contest; extends quote regarding app.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/13/uk-lawmaker-matt-hancock-doesnt-regret-pro-crypto-swerve,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/21cc2506a54985b8009b9311b5f1d91436368cc6-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Its business accounts support more than 100 cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), Cardano's ADA and Solana's SOL.

Christophe Durand, the deputy head of the French National Cyber Unit, told the AFP the investigation had started ""at the end of 2021.”  The police suspect the five individuals of having formed a network that fraudulently advertised a service that would produce an animated version of any users’ BAYC non-fungible tokens (NFT). The individuals operated out of BAYC’s official Discord channel, which lent a blanket of authenticity to their purported services.  The phishing scam required interested users to click on a link to generate an animation. But instead of animated apes, the users found the service stole their NFTs, digital assets on a blockchain that represent ownership of virtual or physical items, with the scammers managing to steal over $2.5 million in total.  ZachXBT uncovered the crime in an August post titled “Scammers in Paris.” An online trail of the crypto funds movement at the time eventually led to the unmasking of the scammers Mathys and Camille, who the Paris police now consider central to the operation.  The duo mainly targeted BAYC collections, but also seemed to have phished holders of Azuki and Doodles, two other popular NFT collections.  Meanwhile, the Paris police said the five individuals were born between 1998 and 2003 and lived in Paris, Caen and Tours. The parents of one of them were also initially indicted but later released without prosecution.  Among the five, two are suspected of having made the site and the marketing, and three others are said to have done the advertising and the money laundering operations.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/10/13/crypto-sleuth-zachxbts-efforts-lead-to-prosecution-of-alleged-bored-ape-nft-scammers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3a119814d6525ba3697af72e1caa9b84a4e592ea-1088x816.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The ROSE price action has recently rebounded from the $0.54 support and is heading upwards. The altcoin currently trades at $0.056 with an intraday gain of 0.88%. A 3% jump will hit the dynamic resistance trendline with sustained buying. However, until this trendline is intact, the coin holders are under bearish threat. Key Points: Multiple retests to the downsloping trendline indicate the trader are aggressively selling at rallies. A bullish divergence in the daily-RSI slope, the buying pressure increases at $0.0054 support. The intraday trading volume in Oasis Network is $17.3 Million. Source-Tradingview ROSE Technical Analysis Over the past seven weeks, the ROSE coin price has faced constant resistance from a downsloping trendline. Moreover, the ongoing bearish sentiment in the market fueled this downfall and contained the growth. Therefore, the series of lower highs indicates a gradual loss of bullish momentum, which may lead to a significant price drop. Currently, the $0.54 horizontal support is holding up the price and has prevented the altcoin from reaching the June-July bottom support of $0.45. Thus, a daily candle closing below the $0.54 floor will intensify the selling pressure and plunge the prices 20% down to the $0.45 mark.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading just over $19,100, about flat for the past 24 hours as investors waited for Thursday's release of the next U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report. Barring the unexpected, the CPI is expected to show a slight drop, but hardly sufficient to sway the U.S. central bank from its current monetary aggressiveness. BTC has remained range-bound for weeks, largely between $19,000 and $21,000, although it dipped briefly below the lower support on Wednesday. Trading volume has remained tepid, falling regularly below 20-day averages.  ""Nothing happening today, Bodhi Pinkner, a research analyst at crypto-focused financial services firm Arca, told CoinDesk. ""Markets were up marginally.""  Pinkner added: ""Very, very low trading volumes across the space. We've been stuck in a range.""  Ether, the second-largest crypto in market value, was recently changing hands below $1,300, about where it stood much of Wednesday but up roughly 1% from Tuesday, same time. Other major cryptos were mostly flat, although SUSHI recently fell more than 5%, while TRON was up more than 1%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, was flat.  Equities  Stocks cast their promising first two days of October further in the rearview mirror as the tech-heavy Nasdaq, the S&P 500, which has a strong technology component, and Dow Jones Industrial Average extended their current losing streaks to six days. Markets chewed nervously over a 0.4% increase in September's producer-price index, a discouraging sign following the previous month's slight decrease.  CPI observers anticipate the latest reading remaining above 8% with core inflation, which eliminates the impact of volatile food and energy prices, rising to 6.5%, a four-decade high. The increase would bolster an already determined Federal Reserve's argument for continuing its recent diet of sharp interest rate hikes, discouraging already skittish investors from riskier assets.  In an on-stage discussion Wednesday at the International Monetary Fund's annual meeting, the organization's Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, said that central banks should refrain from currency interventions, instead suggesting that they use interest-rate raises as the preferred tool for combating foreign-exchange weakness versus the dollar. “Do not waste your reserves to protect your currency,” Georgieva said  Arca's Pinkner noted a downward trend in the correlation between cryptocurrencies and other risk assets over the last couple of months. ""However, in order for any decoupling, you likely need a catalyst, and it's possible that catalyst would be widespread currency debasement across various economies and mostly to bitcoin as a non-sovereign, safe haven asset, and it's possible that catalyst is unforeseen or that there's just no catalyst, and we remain correlated to risk assets.""

A few have tried, but so far nobody can agree about the findings of the enumerators.  Horizon Worlds, like Decentraland and the metaverse at large, isn’t as popular as what Mark Zuckerberg or metaverse token holders want you to think. The problem is in the numbers.  Earlier this month, The Verge reported Meta’s VR social network Horizon Worlds is so bug-ridden that even its developers aren’t using it much.  “But currently feedback from our creators, users, playtesters, and many of us on the team is that the aggregate weight of paper cuts, stability issues, and bugs is making it too hard for our community to experience the magic of Horizon,” Meta’s vice president of metaverse, Vishal Shah, wrote in a memo obtained by The Verge. “Simply put, for an experience to become delightful and retentive, it must first be usable and well crafted.”  Meta claims that Horizon Worlds has 300,000 signups, but there’s no indication of how many are active users.  One proxy could involve looking at the population of related Facebook groups: The official Horizon Worlds page has 31,644 followers while an official Horizon Worlds Facebook community group has 28,200 members. Let’s assume there’s plenty of overlap meaning the higher number is the total addressable market.  If we want to figure out the serviceable available market we must look at the install base of virtual reality headsets.  Digital gaming store Steam – a must-have for any PC gamer – says that 2% of its 132 million monthly active users have a VR headset. Of this two million, 64% are using Meta’s Oculus headsets, putting the install base at 1.28 million.  So with that in mind, even if Meta’s figure of 300,000 is correct it only means that 23% of its VR install base is using what Meta believes to be the future of the company. But that’s the best-case scenario, the more realistic number is closer to 31,644 which would mean that around 2% of the VR install base is using Horizon Worlds as Meta intended.  Decentraland’s fuzzy math  But what about Decentraland? There was some MANA mania earlier this week when CoinDesk, citing DappRadar numbers, reported that it was a lonely world with 38 people in the $1.3 billion ecosystem.  DappRadar’s number relies on analyzing smart contracts from Decentraland that are being interacted with. Decentraland HQ says it's not looking at the whole picture and only a handful of the hundreds of available smart contracts.  Decentraland, instead, offers its own sets of numbers via its portal DCL-Metrics which says that there have been around 7,000 unique users in the last 24 hours visiting 6,900-odd virtual parcels.  The validity of these numbers begins to dissolve once you take a closer look at them. Their data shows that there are also dozens of ""marathon users"" that have spent the majority of the day in Decentraland.  There’s also another list of users – that don’t seem to overlap – that have visited hundreds of parcels during the course of the day.  Clearly, there are bots among us.  Perhaps the most realistic number from DCL-Metrics could be found in the daily active users at the ICE Poker house, which it says is just under 3,000. This might actually be where Decentraland’s real population lies as ICE Poker has an actual, documented player base.  There are two more stars in the sky of data that can help us triangulate a position.  On Github, Decentraland runs something called a Catalyst Monitor, a tool for tracking the load on each of its servers which it calls catalysts.  The count from the servers shows that there are 518 total users on the platform as of late Wednesday afternoon Asia time.  This number comes close to the headcount of 457 that Nansen estimates on its Entity Billboard tool. Nansen would like to stress that this tool is very much in Beta, and only tracks 72 of the smart contracts Decentraland uses.  At the same time, there are 269,698 unique holders of MANA tokens. Even if we use some best-case numbers from ICE’s poker house count of 3000 as a proxy for Decentraland’s total active population (this would be a best case scenario, realistically the number is closer to what Catalyst and Nansen provide) that means only 1% of MANA token holders are users of the platform.  Not exactly a bullish case for Decentraland and the Metaverse at large.  But we had all of this a decade ago with Second Life. Which had better graphics, smoother gameplay, and an actual community – not token holders pumping their bags trying to make you believe that this is the future of the internet.

With the hikes in interest rates from most of the global central banks, the global economy is getting tighter. The impact on both the crypto and traditional markets is significantly devastating. Following the events, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned about economic decline. Furthermore, it speaks of a possible worse global recession in 2023. This means that financial markets will go risk-off, creating extreme fear for the markets.

BTC Price Correlates With Stocks? The price of Bitcoin has depicted a strong correlation with equity assets for more than a year. This is seen with most of the trends for BTC and some stocks in most cases. Several factors and conditions have been highlighted as explanations for the correlation. One of the stocks with a solid link to Bitcoin is S&amp;P 500. Bitcoin witnessed a price drop during the global pandemic recession in 2020. This was the same story for equity stocks. But as the economic conditions gradually progressed positively, the system transited accordingly. As a result, the crypto and equity markets sold off in December 2021 and May 2022.

42434998,tMM71Y4MCzC4OCrGaGniNx,1665623936,US Judge Allows Crypto Advocates to Join Ooki Defense Against CFTC,"A federal judge ruled late Wednesday that two groups of crypto advocates could argue that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) should not be able to serve the members of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) through a website help bot.  U.S. District Judge William Orrick, of the Northern District of California, ordered that LeXpunK Army, a group of lawyers and software developers, and the DeFi Education Fund (DEF), a lobbyist group, could file amicus, or friend of the court, briefs. The two groups asked to join the case to argue the CFTC should identify and directly serve members of Ooki DAO in a lawsuit alleging they violated federal law, rather than serve the DAO itself through a website chat bot.  The CFTC sued Ooki DAO last month, alleging the collective group offered illegal leveraged and margin trading products, as had its predecessor company bZeroX. While the regulator settled the bZeroX charges with the company's founders, it was unable to identify key figures attached to the DAO, and sought permission to serve it by posting on a forum and a chat bot. Controversially, the CFTC also alleged that every voting member of the DAO should be held individually liable for the illicit activity.  Read more: Ooki DAO Case So ‘Egregious,’ CFTC Had No Choice, Chair Behnam Says  Earlier this month, Judge Orrick ruled in the CFTC's favor, the same day LeXpunk filed its motion for leave to file the amicus brief. DEF filed its own motion a few days later. In Wednesday's ruling, the judge gave LeXpunK until Oct. 17 to file its amicus brief. DeFi Fund filed its own amicus brief alongside its motion for leave.  ""Additionally, I interpret these requests as Motions for Reconsideration regarding my decision to permit alternative service in this case,"" the judge ruled.  The CFTC has until Nov. 7 to oppose the DEF and LeXpunK filings, while the two groups can respond to the CFTC's motion within a week after. There will be a hearing on Nov. 30 to hear the motions.  The ruling throws a lifeline to Ooki DAO, which appears to have geofenced U.S. users, but otherwise had a handful of days left to formally respond to the CFTC.",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/13/us-judge-allows-crypto-advocates-to-join-ooki-defense-against-cftc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9661fc5741a5a6310f3e8f3b251c12a55061b7fc-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
