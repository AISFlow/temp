42374748,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2EzT,1652655540,First Mover Asia: Singapore’s Regulators Will Be Eyeing Local Crypto Companies After Terra Collapse; Bitcoin Rebounds,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin mounts a small Sunday comeback.  Insights: Crypto companies may face more scrutiny in Singapore.  Technician's take: BTC is on track for its first consecutive seven-week decline.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $31,122 +3.5%  Ether (ETH): $2,139 +4.5%  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Cosmos ATOM +14.1% Smart Contract Platform Solana SOL +13.6% Smart Contract Platform Cardano ADA +12.7% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Bitcoin Cash BCH −3.4% Currency  Bitcoin rebounds  As comebacks go, it wasn't much. But Bitcoin will take what it can get at this point.  So will other cryptos hammered last week by the toxic mix of geopolitical unrest, rising interest rates, recessionary fears and the implosion of the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin and the LUNA token that backs it.  Bitcoin was recently trading above $31,000, up about 3.5% over the past 24 hours and roughly 16% from the $26,600 depths it sank to mid-Friday. ""Bitcoin did indeed face downward pressure that saw it losing the $30K support, but it did not fall below the 25K level,"" Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, wrote to CoinDesk.  Ether, the second largest crypto by market cap, was recently up similarly and changing hands at about $2,100 after earlier in the week dropping below $1,800 for the first time in two months. Most major altcoins spent Sunday well in the green, recovering some of the ground they lost last week as the crypto market cap tumbled by $300 billion. SOL rose more than 10% at one point, although its $55 price was down from over $70 at the start of the week.  ADA, AVAX and AXS posted increases ranging between 9% and 11%. BCH was among the few losers earlier Sunday.  Crypto gains dovetailed with equity markets that finally enjoyed some good news Friday after six straight days of declines. The tech-focused Nasdaq closed up 3.8%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial average rose 2.3% and 1.4%, respectively. Still, the week's economic bad news is unlikely to shake investors from their risk-averse positions of recent months.  On Wednesday, the U.S. Commerce Department announced that consumer prices had risen 8.3% in April, slightly better than the previous month but nevertheless a sign that inflation driving a range of goods and services would linger. Even the once torrid housing market has felt shockwaves as mortgage rates have risen over 5.3%, increasing the difficulty for would-be homeowners to finance their purchases. Investors have been concerned that U.S. central bank hawkishness was inadequate to tame rising prices without throwing the economy into recession.  In an email Friday, Hargreaves Lansdown Senior Investment and Markets Analyst Susannah Streeter highlighted ""investor worries over inflation, supply concerns and the UST fall, which sent LUNA tumbling to a fraction of a cent. ""For now the crypto wild west is taking a breather after reeling from the crash brought on by the collapse of a so-called stablecoin,"" Streeter wrote, adding: ""This latest plunge in the wheel of fortune demonstrates that speculating in cryptocurrencies is extremely high risk and is not suitable for investors who don’t have money they can afford to lose.’’  BitBull's DiPasquale noted that ""a near-term bounce"" in Bitcoin ""is still intact but a proper reversal needs more buying activity."" He called last week's low ""a decent buying opportunity for long-term exposure,"" but also warned that ""the coming month may bring additional volatility as more concrete steps by the FED to fight inflation come to the fore.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,023 +2.3%  DJIA: 32,196 +1.4%  Nasdaq: 11,805 +3.8%  Gold: $1,811 -0.5%  Insights  Singapore will be eyeing locally registered crypto firms  As the week closed in Asia, LUNA and UST were de-listed from most exchanges as the Terra blockchain was halted for nine hours, restarted and then halted again as the market seemed to reject a recovery plan.  The question on many people’s minds is, how will token holders be made whole? That’s where things get complicated.  Terraform Labs, the Singapore-registered company behind the Terra protocol, doesn’t have a permanent office. The Singapore address it provides is a registration agent, home to hundreds of Singaporean companies. Its offices are rented co-working spaces worldwide; like many Web 3 startups, there’s no formal headquarters.  The only assets the company has are from the Luna Foundation Guard. This non-profit organization, also registered in Singapore and overseen by Do Kwon, controls the wallets that were to support the UST peg during times of extreme volatility. The majority of these wallets are now empty, with the only thing of value remaining being the approximately $69 million in avalanche token (AVAX).  Singapore’s regulators are aware of the trend of crypto companies using a Singaporean entity to conduct business abroad with no material ties to the country. In April, its Parliament passed a bill into law that included provisions that require domestically registered crypto companies that do business abroad to be licensed primarily for anti-money laundering reasons, but leaves the door open in the future for this to expand.  As the year began, Terra’s LUNA token had a market cap of $33 billion. Its UST stablecoin had a market cap of $10 billion. Now, both have a virtual value of $0.  Should there be a legal case made against the companies behind the protocol by the token holders, what sort of assets could be seized? What jurisdiction does the Singapore government have over Do Kwon and co-founder Daniel Shin? On company filings with local authorities, both provide addresses in Singapore but it's unclear if they reside there full time, as Kwon maintains a residence in South Korea, too.  With its lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Terraform Labs and Do Kwon asserted that American regulators don’t have jurisdiction over Kwon, a Korean residing in Singapore. They have no ties to the U.S., so how can they be targeted by regulators? they argued. But they might find themselves dealing with Singapore’s justice system, and while the country has a favorable securities framework compared to the U.S. its courts are known to be otherwise strict.  Should the Singaporean government feel like the nation’s reputation is at stake because of a registered company with few material ties that blew up tens of billions of dollars, it will come after them hard and may start the process of closing the door entirely on crypto firms that use a Singaporean shell but do business abroad.  If that happens, will Terraform and Kwon also claim the “no jurisdiction” route?  Technician's take  Bitcoin Oversold, Resistance at $33K-$35K  Bitcoin (BTC) bounced toward $30,000 on Friday as buyers reacted to oversold conditions. Still, any upside appears to be limited, and the cryptocurrency could face resistance at $33,000 and $35,000.  Momentum signals remain negative on the daily, weekly and monthly charts, which typically leads to a period of low or negative returns. Further, BTC is on track for its first-ever consecutive seven-week decline, according to Coinbase (COIN) price data provided by TradingView, dating back to 2014. That's also a sign of negative price momentum.  For now, BTC is approaching lower support near its 200-week moving average, which is now at $21,800. Immediate support is between $27,000 and $30,000, which could stabilize price action over the next few days.  Also, on Thursday, short-term countertrend signals appeared on the charts, which typically leads to a brief price bounce.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the weekly chart is the most oversold since March 2020, although strong resistance and negative momentum suggests limited upside over the next few months.

42374749,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2F0j,1652653687,"At Nationals Ballpark, Terra’s Bad Week Never Happened","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Terra may be on the ropes after last week’s dramatic death spiral, but the cryptocurrency’s name is still loudly emblazoned at the ballpark of Major League Baseball’s Washington Nationals.  As the team wrapped up a series against the visiting Houston Astros on Sunday, CoinDesk went to see if the $38.5 million advertising deal had worked. Were people at the ballpark aware of Terra or its UST stablecoin? Had anyone bought the asset, now worth far less than a penny, when it was trading at $115 on opening day just a few months ago?  Responses from the stadium’s employees and patrons would suggest not. Few had heard of Terra’s demise despite the attention it captured in the cryptosphere, with even fewer owning the asset or any cryptocurrency, for that matter. One elevator operator said Terra was Latin for “dirt.”  Nevertheless, Terra may be a name Nationals fans eventually come to recognize. In February, LUNAtics rubber-stamped a proposal to place the blockchain’s name on in-stadium branding for the next five years, with payment for the deal being made up front and in U.S. dollars.  The deal includes Terra’s logo being stitched into the high-priced seats behind home plate, which are highly visible on television broadcasts, as well as the naming rights to the “Terra Club,” the stadium’s all-inclusive dining lounge reserved for luxury fans.  Whether the Nationals hold up their end of the deal remains in the air, as do plans to accept payments in UST slated for next season. Representatives of the franchise declined CoinDesk’s repeated requests for comment, and were not available for interviews at Sunday’s game.  Crypto entities seeking out sports sponsorships like the Nationals’ deal with Terra have been a regular occurrence in the past year. Another MLB sponsorship was from the crypto exchange FTX, whose logo can be seen on the uniforms of the game’s umpires. While the Nationals’ deal with Terra isn't the only protocol tie-up in the league (Tezos sponsors the New York Mets, for example) it’s certainly the first high-profile blowup.  But corporate sports sponsorships have a storied history of going south. Enron Field (a $100 million naming-rights deal that lasted just two of its intended 30 years) and Webvan (whose logo remained on 42,000 cupholders at the San Francisco Giants ballpark long after it went bankrupt in the 2001 dot-com crash) are notable MLB flops.  Read more: Terra Wants to Spend $40M on a Mystery Sports Deal. We Think It’s With This MLB Team  That’s not to say the Nationals faithful were completely in the dark about Terra. One man seated in the Terra Club was well aware of the multibillion-dollar implosion; on Sunday he was telling his friends how that one coin went to zero.  The fan told CoinDesk he held no crypto and wasn’t keen on changing that, especially after Terra. An ardent Nationals fan, he expressed something between dismay and grumbling acceptance for a deal the Nationals did “for the money.” He was happy to hear Terra paid up front.  Of the roughly two dozen people CoinDesk spoke with, only one, an usher in a nearby section, knew the details of last week’s stunning collapse, expressing something like wonder at the fact an asset trading above $100 was now virtually worthless.  Another, a bartender inside the Terra Club, knew Terra was some sort of “bitcoin” and seemed to know it had had a rough week. She said she had no money to invest in it and no plans to, but had heard it would “come back.”  The Astros went on to defeat the Nationals by a score of 8-0 on Sunday, finishing off the series sweep behind five strong innings from perennial ace pitcher Justin Verlander.",NEUTRAL,LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | LUNA | TRADING,"Eli Tan, Danny Nelson, Zack Seward",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/15/at-nationals-ballpark-terras-bad-week-never-happened,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1bcd05ef7e284a330350e372c9195e3d4873cff4-5184x3888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411470,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glO5Jx,1652626800,"The Collapse of UST and LUNA Was Devastating, but There Is Still Hope for Crypto","First, I want to highlight that a lot of regular, hardworking people lost money because of the crypto market crash over the last week or so. Some people lost all of their money. While money isn’t everything, losing a lot of it sure does feel like it. If you or someone you know lost money in the LUNA/UST crash, know that life is always worth living.  If you somehow don’t already know, terraUSD (UST), a cryptocurrency that is supposed to stay at $1 (aka a stablecoin), is no longer $1. When something is supposed to be $1 and it’s not, that’s usually not good. What’s more, the crypto token that backs UST, LUNA, also lost virtually all of its value. These losses have been widely reported on, and so in all likelihood, this is the umpteen-millionth piece about UST you’ve seen.  But it has to be done because readers will remember me gushing over the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) – the nonprofit aimed at promoting and stabilizing the Terra ecosystem (which issues UST and LUNA) – announcing it would buy $10 billion of bitcoin to back UST. In fairness to me, I was mostly excited that I was able to write about something that Hal Finney published to the famed Bitcoin Talk forum. But in fairness to … the truth, I was not not excited about the possibility of a bitcoin-backed stablecoin.  All said, I’m going to pack as much as I can into this column about Terra without being overwhelming or unoriginal.  Here goes …  – George Kaloudis  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  There are these things in crypto called stablecoins. Stablecoins are supposed to be $1. Usually. Sometimes they are 1 euro or 1 won, but usually not. Blame U.S. dollar hegemony. Stablecoins exist so that crypto-natives can get in and out of the dollar easily without needing a bank to approve deposits and withdrawals. Stablecoins facilitate most crypto trading volume and power the never-ending crypto carousel that is “DeFi” (decentralized finance). More importantly, stablecoins are used by citizens subject to totalitarian governments spurring on hyperinflation.  There are a few flavors of stablecoins out there, notably tether (USDT), USD coin (USDC), binance USD (BUSD) and dai (DAI). Also quite notably, we had terraUSD (UST). These are the five largest stablecoins and they represent roughly $160 billion of value. Three of these stablecoins (USDT, USDC, BUSD) are collateralized stablecoins issued by centralized entities. These entities own a treasury of dollars that back each coin so that each coin can be redeemed for $1 by the holder from the issuer.  DAI is different in that it is collateralized and backed by a diversified portfolio of crypto assets. Instead of being issued by a centralized entity, a decentralized autonomous organization (or “DAO”) called MakerDAO manages DAI. DAI is collateralized with crypto rather than dollars, but it is, and this is critical, overcollateralized.  UST is even more different. It’s not collateralized at all. It is an algorithmic stablecoin powered by the Terra protocol. Instead, it is backed by a crypto token called LUNA. I covered how this works in a previous newsletter writing:  When UST’s price is too high (>$1), the protocol incentivizes users to burn (destroy) LUNA and mint (make) UST. When UST’s price is too low (<$1), the protocol incentivizes users to burn (destroy) UST and mint (make) LUNA.  This is pretty clever on the surface. It’s simple. If the demand for UST is high enough to increase its price to $1.01, the protocol prints some UST in exchange for getting rid of some LUNA. The problem is that it works perfectly until it doesn’t. And boy did it stop working last Monday …  That’s supposed to be $1, not 11 cents. The LUNA chart somehow looks worse.  OK, naturally, you’re thinking that the mechanism broke or something. It didn’t break. It worked as designed and you can see that if you look at the amount of LUNA that has been issued as the protocol tried to algorithmically bring UST back to $1 while LUNA’s price was also tanking.  That’s right. The total supply of LUNA went from about 725 million tokens on May 5 to about 7 trillion on May 13. Meanwhile, LUNA lost 99.9% of its value. This is what hyperinflation looks like.  As mentioned above, Terraform Labs (the company behind Terra) laid out a plan to buy $10 billion of bitcoin and other crypto assets through the LFG in order to act as a backstop in case something like this happened. The problem remained, though. UST wasn’t fully collateralized like the other stablecoins in the top 5. Before the collapse, UST’s market capitalization was $18 billion, way more than the nearly $4 billion the foundation had in reserve.  Whatever happened, we got lucky  Our friends at crypto data provider Kaiko did a great job breaking down what exactly happened. The short of it is this: UST dipped below $1, and all attempts, both by the Terra protocol algorithm and by the lending out of LFG reserves to trading firms, couldn’t bring UST back to $1. Between UST and LUNA, over $40 billion of value was lost.  What exactly happened doesn’t really matter. What really matters is that when something bad happened, Terra couldn’t handle it. What really matters is that an undercollateralized, algorithmic stablecoin will fail no matter how long it succeeds.  The system failed. But if we’re honest, UST was a wild success up until the moment it wasn’t. History should serve as a lesson here, when we inevitably will see a successful UST copycat crop up in 2027 or whatever.  We also are incredibly lucky that UST and LUNA aren’t big or intertwined enough to cause mass hysteria across all markets. I honestly believe we were lucky this happened in 2022 and not in 2030. Bloomberg’s Matt Levine put it well:  Five years from now, if every cryptocurrency goes to zero … well, I don’t know what the next five years will be like, but a plausible story (as of last week anyway!) is that there will be continuing integration of crypto into the real economy. More crypto companies will be big and important and intertwined with other companies; their stock will be in the indexes and they will borrow money from banks and use their own money to finance real businesses. ... Crypto platforms will be used for real economic activity; ordinary people will invest their savings in those platforms, and those investments will be used to finance real, non-crypto business activity.  Spot on. Even if you’re like me, a bitcoin maximalist praying for the day where we go back to just one cryptocurrency, you have to admit that we are going to see more crypto in more industries in the short to medium term. Except next time an undercollateralized, algorithmic stablecoin fails, it’s not going to be $40 billion of lost value. It might be $400 billion. That could be catastrophic. We should look to avoid that scenario at all costs.  What else did we learn from the UST crash?  On the bright side, somehow bitcoin didn’t completely collapse. Over 80,000 BTC from that almost $4 billion treasury was potentially sold (we can’t yet confirm if the bitcoin was actually sold, but it was sent to exchanges) during the mad dash to get UST back to $1. That caused a price reaction, sure, but then again, the broader crypto market sold off because bad things were happening to a big crypto project (LUNA was once the 10th most valuable cryptocurrency). Add on the tenuous macroeconomic environment and general risk-off sentiment in the market, and it feels almost impossible that bitcoin still boasts a market cap of over $500 billion.  I think we are numb to these large numbers given the unprecedented bull market of the last 13 years, and so this bears repeating. Bitcoin was a worthless, purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash created by an unknown person in 2009. No big company or government put marketing, research or legal dollars behind it, and yet it is now a serious macro asset that important politicians and financiers feel the need to comment on.  A serious macro asset that can take huge swathes of selling volume and still … not … go … away. Bitcoin is here to stay. So is crypto. As long as we learn from this, that can be a good thing.  But if history is any indication, we still need to ensure that overconfidence doesn’t get the best of “future us.”",NEUTRAL,BTC | LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/15/the-collapse-of-ust-and-luna-was-devastating-but-there-is-still-hope-for-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4bc7e3b9b55f449922c932b798360b982d44cf5c-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
