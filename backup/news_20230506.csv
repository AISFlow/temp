In a week marked by market losses and little gains, the DeFi token showed much resilience to emerge as one of the biggest weekly gainers. Although most of the market stands in awe of the stunning bullish performance of the popular meme coin – PEPE -, UMA’s remarkable price gain has recorded much profit for its investors, drawing significant attention. Related Reading: PEPE Market Cap Crosses $1 Billion As Gemini Listing Rumors Spread UMA’s Price Action Initially, UMA began trading the week around a price region of $1.95. The token showed no significant movement until two days after when it attempted a bullish run but couldn’t break past the resistance level at $2.31. On May 5, i.e., yesterday, UMA experienced a hike in its market price, gaining by over 43% to move from $2.18 to break above the $3 price mark for the first time since August 2022. Although UMA’s price has since slipped from such high levels, the DeFi token appeared to have found support and could be gearing for another breakout. At the time of writing, UMA is trading around $2.55, with a 0.22% loss in the last 24 hours. In this same period, the token’s trading volume has boosted by a staggering 438.82% to attain a value of $336.70 million. Interestingly, UMA’s price growth is also reflected by the growing traction on its platform. Based on data from Stelareum, Total Value Locked (TVL) on the UMA protocol has grown from $10.33 million to $11.12 million over the last two days.

The Optimistic Snapshot Execution, or oSnap as it is known, enables the “execution onchain of transactions performed off-chain immediately but with protections against harmful proposal execution.” The last protocol to integrate the oSnap module was the popular decentralized exchange, ShapeShift. That said, UMA generally functions as a decentralized platform that allows other DeFi protocols to build “priceless” financial contracts on Ethereum while providing them with publicly verifiable market data. In essence, this project functions as an oracle, granting various DeFi protocols the underlying infrastructure to create fast, efficient, and secure synthetic derivatives on the Ethereum blockchain.

The cryptocurrency inspired by Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu pup has long been considered as the next big memecoin and it appears to be living up to its hype. Floki Inu is currently up 40% in the past 24 hours and is the second-best performing crypto-asset during this period after the fast-rising Pepe token. Floki Inu Benefiting From High-Profile Listings This latest price surge can be linked to a series of high-profile listings by exchanges in recent days. Bitfinex was the first to announce the listing of Floki on May 3rd in a move that came out of the blue and surprised many in the crypto community. This was followed by Binance, the largest exchange in the world, disclosing on May 5th that it would be listing Floki alongside Pepe in its innovation zone, with users able to deposit as of May 5th. The exchange further noted that it would begin trading the tokens on May 6th across four pairs: PEPE/USDT, PEPE/TUSDT, FLOKI/USDT, and FLOKI/TUSD. Binance also intends to permit borrowing on both assets and plans to add new margin pairs for FLOKI and PEPE on Isolated Margin in the next 48 hours. The Isolated Margin pairs include FLOKI/USDT and PEPE/USDT. News of this listing caused significant excitement to the crypto community, which led to a positive market movement for both assets. PEPE achieved a new market high of $0.0000028, surpassing the $1 billion market cap, while FLOKI also increased by 60% within a few hours. During this period, Floki Inu has experienced increased trading volume as many investors look to purchase the token in anticipation of a bull run. The recent bull-run of PEPE, which has risen by 11,000% in less than a month, has spurred the hype for memecoins and Floki Inu appears to be the major beneficiary. Related Reading: Former DoJ Kennedy Jr, Laments on Global Financial Censorship, Shows Support For Bitcoin What’s Next For Floki Inu?

Its low transaction fees and suite of products, including an NFT metaverse game, the FlokiFi Defi ecosystem, the Floki University, and the NFT marketplace, have placed it high among crypto enthusiasts.

While this trend may suggest a growing interest in the cryptocurrency, it also indicates that the price of ETH may experience surging volatility in the near future.

Presently, exchanges have recorded close to 9,200 unique deposits of ETH, which is the highest amount since the introduction of the Merge upgrade last year.

12391917,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=530232,1683366043,New York Attorney General Proposes New Crypto Regulatory Act,"New York Attorney General (AG) Letitia James has proposed a new state bill to regulate the cryptocurrency industry further, as she believes the space is enduring “rampant fraud and dysfunction”. This new set of crypto regulations would impose independent public audits of crypto exchanges, ensuring that New York residents do not lose their cryptocurrency investments to deceptive business practices. Related Reading: Pro-XRP Lawyer Castigates The SEC’s Argument Saying It’s Unfounded And Absurd New York AG Announces ‘Strongest And Most Comprehensive’ CRPTO Act On Friday, May 5th, the office of the New York Attorney General released a press statement, disclosing the plans to augment state regulations over cryptocurrency and crypto-related organizations. James proposed the “Crypto Regulation, Protection, Transparency, and Oversight” (CRPTO) Act as a new piece of crypto legislation. James described the CRPTO Act as “the strongest and most comprehensive” batch of regulations over the crypto industry in the United States. The AG’s office noted that the proposed bill, if passed, will safeguard investors, consumers, and the broader economy. In her proposal, the attorney general suggested that the state of New York impose independent public audits of crypto exchanges and prohibit residents from owning brokerages and cryptocurrency-issuing companies to prevent conflicts of interest. Additionally, the bill would mandate crypto organizations to reimburse customers for fraud-related losses. The CRPTO Act is quite comprehensive, as it also tackles the regulation of the stablecoin ecosystem. The proposed state law specifies that firms should only be allowed to market a digital asset as a stablecoin if it is backed one-to-one by “U.S. currency or high-quality liquid assets as defined in federal regulations”. The CRPTO proposal will make it to the floor of the New York State Senate and Assembly during the 2023 legislative session. If passed, it would give the attorney general’s office the authority to issue subpoenas for violations of the regulations and impose civil penalties (up to $10,000 for individuals and $100,000 for organizations). New York Regulators To Continue Crackdown On Crypto Following the huge collapses that rocked the crypto industry in 2022, various federal agencies, particularly the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have turned up the heat on the digital asset industry this year. In response, several crypto organizations have bemoaned the lack of clarity clouding cryptocurrency regulations in the country. Interestingly, not only the Federal regulatory authorities are currently on high alert. State regulators, like the New York AG’s office, have also intensified regulatory efforts on the crypto industry. For instance, the New York Attorney General’s office filed a lawsuit against the crypto platform KuCoin in March, alleging the firm provided brokerage services without properly registering. In February, the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) ordered Paxos to stop minting stablecoin BUSD, stating that the dollar-pegged asset is an unregistered security. With the proposed set of crypto regulations by attorney general Letitia James, it doesn’t appear that the New York regulators are slowing down in their clampdown on the crypto industry this year. In any case, the cryptocurrency industry continues to show strength, with a market cap of $1.177 trillion.

12391078,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=530196,1683363190,Bitcoin Miners Reap Profits As Mining Difficulty Hits 3-Month Low,"Bitcoin miners have received a boost in profits after the scheduled difficulty level adjustment resulted in a positive balance. This is the first time since February that the difficulty, which controls the issuance of coins on the network, has decreased. Recent data from Braiins showed that Bitcoin computing power experienced a drop of over 45+ EH/s between April 20 and 28. However, this trend has been reversed with the increase in miner profits over the last week. Despite the recovery of the hashrate to 350 EH/s, it was not sufficient to prevent a 1.45% difficulty adjustment retracement, as stated by Mempool.space. Currently, the mining difficulty level is at 48T (trillions). This change in difficulty level affects the miners’ profitability, as less competition for the reward means increased estimated income for those still connected to the network. Bitcoin Miners Profit As Hashprice Increases The current price for Bitcoin hashpower rose to 0.088 USD/TH/day (88 USD/PH/day), up from 0.077 USD/TH/day (77 USD/PH/day) on May 2. This 11.49% increase over three days is a positive development for Bitcoin miners, indicating increased profitability for their operations. The hashprice is a crucial metric for calculating the profitability of a mining operation, representing the value assigned to a unit of computation in dollars per terahash or petahash per day. While the cause of the significant hashrate drop last week is uncertain, the current state of the network justifies the quick reconnection of miners. Recently, there has been increased interest in BRC-20 tokens, which are used to create memecoins, leading to network congestion in Bitcoin within a few days of their release. As recently reported, this could be a possible factor in the hashrate drop. As a result of this high activity on the network, the fees are now making up 12.4% of the miners’ revenue. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Out: Experts Predict $36,000 Target As Market Outlook Remains Positive Bitcoin Commissions Rise After New Ordinals Record In the wake of the rising interest in tokens that can be registered to Bitcoin through Ordinals, the value of transaction fees paid by Bitcoin users has surged. Within a single day, the average transaction fees have more than doubled. As per the data from Mempool.space, the current transaction fees range from 70 sat/vB to 100 sat/vB. This implies that a transaction of 140 vB (median) would require payment of almost $4 USD to get confirmed within the first few minutes. Note that the sudden interest in tokens registered through Ordinals is responsible for the backlog of transactions that need confirmation, leading to a surge in average commissions. According to Murch, a Bitcoin developer, the mempool depth has reached 104 blocks despite having 8 blocks per hour for the last six hours. The rise of Ordinals NFTs has not been without controversy, as some Bitcoin maximalists blame this trend for the increased transaction fees that have resurfaced in recent months.

The Justice Department inquiry is another high-profile action against Binance after a 2021 joint investigation with the Internal Revenue Service against the global exchange. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also been investigating Binance for its relationship with two firms owned by its founder Changpeng Zhao since at least early 2022.  Spokespeople for Binance and the Justice Department did not immediately return CoinDesk's requests for comment.  The Justice Department declined a Bloomberg request for comment. A Binance statement to Bloomberg said the company complies fully with all U.S. and international financial sanctions.  In March, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sued Binance alleging the company knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S. against federal law.  The exchange has repeatedly pushed back against allegations by saying it has built the world's largest compliance team in the space – a 700-member team that ""addresses 1,300 law enforcement requests on a weekly basis,"" Tigran Gambaryan, Binance's head of financial crime compliance, said at CoinDesk's Consensus conference last week.  In recent days, Binance has claimed to have figured out how to keep North Koreans off its crypto exchange by kicking ""their a-- enough that they're actually able to recognize that Binance was not the place for them.""  Additionally, this month, Israel reportedly revealed it had seized roughly 190 Binance accounts with alleged ties to terrorist groups, including two accounts to ISIS.
