The GBX was first launched in July as an ""institutional-grade"" token sale platform and digital asset exchange. It currently offers U.S. dollar onboarding and a number of trading pairs against USD. More fiat options and trading pairs are planned in the future.  CEO Nick Cowan commented:  “Gibraltar has found the right blend of sensible and supportive regulation, which has helped position the jurisdiction as a lodestar for the global cryptocurrency space, while allowing blockchain companies to flourish.”  The GFSC announced the DLT regulatory framework in January of this year, making it mandatory for firms using blockchain to “store or transmit value belonging to others” to apply for a license. The plan to create the new licensing scheme was first revealed in December 2017.

42402271,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3lqA,1542978050,Ethereum Developers Are Quietly Planning an Accelerated Tech Roadmap,"Ethereum developers are quietly discussing a previously undisclosed upgrade that could boost the capabilities of the technology more aggressively in the short-term.  Specifically, the minutes from four private meetings that took place at the Devcon4 conference at the end of October, refer to an upgrade named ""ethereum 1x,"" possibly to be activated in June 2019.  An internal document containing the minutes was published to Github by an engineer of the ethereum virtual machine, Greg Colvin, on Friday.  While previously undisclosed, the minutes have been verified by one attendee who wished to remain anonymous. They told CoinDesk that developers believe the proposals are too early-stage to be discussed publicly. Other developers did not respond to requests for comment.  Still, the meeting notes give a window into one potential reason for the lack of response – ethereum’s more veteran developers appear to be of differing opinions of how best to solicit community feedback on technical proposals in sensitive ideation stages.  Writing on GitHub, release manager for the Parity ethereum client Afri Schoedon expressed that he had been unaware of the document or that plans were in motion for an impending upgrade.  As with all public blockchain networks, ethereum requires a distributed consensus among software users for any changes to its rules, though code changes are typically proposed by developers.  At one of the meetings, attendees included ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin; Joseph Lubin, the founder of the largest ethereum startup Brooklyn-based Consensys Systems; and notable community organizers and developers including Lane Rettig, Peter Szilagyi and Hudson Jameson.  The notes suggest that ethereum developers may be under pressure to augment their public roadmap in ways that seek to add improvements at an accelerated timeline. Several changes were discussed for inclusion in a system-wide upgrade, or hard fork, currently targeted for June, that have not previously been associated with a 2019 release.  The series of upgrades potentially includes replacing ethereum’s underlying virtual machine (EVM), the component that processes smart contract code. It would also introduce “rent,” or storage fees for smart contracts, that would seek to stem the growth of the ethereum blockchain (currently around 1 terabyte on a full archive node), which must be downloaded by all participating nodes.  A defining principle of the project, as outlined in the document, is a ""sense of urgency."" Other project values included ""small, sequential updates,"" ""as much public feedback as possible"" and ""data driven analysis to inform motivations for changes.""  While the upgrade is still in early stages, developers have previously discussed the implementation eWASM as an alternative to the EVM, which would allow a faster and more dexterous approach to ethereum computation.  Rent and similar mechanisms to curtail the growth rate of the blockchain have also been publicly considered, but may require a “large overhaul,” Vitalik Buterin suggested in the meeting. Other ideas to make the state size more manageable are also being discussed.  Developers at the meeting also stressed the importance of working privately in order to coordinate more rapidly around changes. Pushing for as much transparency as possible, Buterin is said to have stated he is “uncomfortable with institutional private calls and absolutely against private forum[s].”  Still, reacting to the meeting minutes on an internal developer chat Friday, Schoedon expressed disapproval that the planning had occurred without public involvement, writing, ""If you want to have private working groups, that’s [fine] and makes sense but you should be transparent and maybe start with a public announcement.""  In response to the meeting, at least three working groups have now been said to have formed – one to focus on the EVM changes, another to discuss changes to smart contract costs and another that would seek to simulate and model the impact of such alternations.  A call is now scheduled for Nov. 30 to reconvene the members of these groups.

The firm lodged an amended voluntary petition at the bankruptcy court in the Eastern District of Washington on Thursday, stating the value of its assets as being between $10 million and $50 million, far higher than the previously stated $0–$50,000 range.  The admin of Giga Watt’s official customer support channel on Telegram, ""Andrey,"" said Friday, “50k is an error. Amendment done. Process of filing was in rush. Mistakes in that case happens.”  The firm's estimated liabilities and number of creditors remain the same as in the previous petition, at $10 million–$50 million and 1–49, respectively.  Giga Watt filed for bankruptcy on Monday with millions of dollars still owed to creditors, including hundreds of thousands to two electricity providers. Its biggest 20 unsecured creditors have claims worth nearly $7 million, according to the firm.  The firm was launched by veteran bitcoin miner Dave Carlson in May 2017 and held an initial coin offering (ICO) the same month that raised about $22 million-worth of cryptocurrency at the time.  This January, however, a group of plaintiffs sued Giga Watt claiming it conducted an unregistered securities offering and seeking the return of their investments.  Carlson left the firm quietly in August, after a number of job layoffs, according to reports.  The company's collapse comes as times are increasingly hard for miners. The price of bitcoin, for example, hit a 14-month low near $4,000 earlier this week, having peaked at almost $20,000 last December. And the market capitalization of the wider crypto markets fell to $136 billion earlier today, its lowest since Sept. 26, 2017, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42402264,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3jy4,1542970866,Bitcoin Price Eyes Double Bottom Reversal After $4K Defense,"Bitcoin's defense of key long-term support for the second time in four days is a positive sign for a potential recovery rally.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell below $4,242 (low of Wednesday's inside-day candle) in the Asian trading hours, putting the bears back into the driver's seat. As a result, BTC fell below the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) of $4,182 earlier today.  The breach of the EMA support, however, may have trapped the bears on the wrong side of the market, as BTC is currently trading at $4,330 on Bitstamp, having clocked an intraday low of $4,061 earlier today.  It is worth noting that the long-term EMA was first breached on Tuesday. The subsequent sell-off, however, ended at the 14-month low of $4,048 and prices recovered to $4,500 on the following day.  The repeated failure to beat the long-term support indicates the bears have likely run out of steam. As a result, a stronger corrective rally could be in the offing.  4-hour chart  On the 4-hour chart, the relative strength index (RSI) has created a bullish divergence with higher lows.  As a result, BTC looks set to test $4,635 – the neckline of the double-bottom bullish reversal pattern. A break above that, if confirmed, would open up upside toward $5,100 (target as per the measured height method).  Daily chart  As seen above, the 14-day relative strength index is holding below 30.00 for the ninth day straight, signaling ongoing oversold conditions.  The 5- and 10-day EMAs, currently at $4,546 and $4,933, respectively, are still trending south. Therefore, corrective rallies above the 10-day EMA, if any, could face exhaustion near $5,000.  View  Repeated defense of the 200-week EMA likely indicates seller exhaustion. (edited  A break above $4,635 would confirm a double-bottom breakout on the 4-hour chart and could yield a stronger recovery rally to $5,100.  A weekly close on Sunday (UTC time) below the 200-week EMA of $4,182 could prove costly, as the next major support is located directly at $3,100 (200-week simple moving average).

42402249,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3jkI,1542965457,Mt Gox Trustee Seeks to Extend Civil Rehabilitation Claims Deadline,"Nobuaki Kobayashi, the trustee of the collapsed bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, is seeking to extend the deadline for filing civil rehabilitation claims to December.  Kobayashi announced Thursday that he will make ""efforts to request the court to accept proofs of rehabilitation claims received by December 26, 2018.”  The earlier deadline of Oct. 22 has already passed, but as the creditors are located worldwide, the trustee said more time is needed to collect proof of claims and ensure that all forms are delivered.  The online filing system for rehabilitation claims is still accessible, and creditors who are unable to access the system can also manually fill and send the forms to the office of the trustee, not later than Dec. 26.  “Whether proofs of rehabilitation claims filed after the deadline will be accepted is determined by the court,” the trustee explained.  Once the world’s largest bitcoin exchange by trading volume, Mt. Gox officially filed for liquidation in April 2014 after claiming to have been hacked for 850,000 bitcoin, some of which was later found. At the same time, it dealt a blow to investors by dropping its plan for civil rehabilitation.  After a long wait, creditors had a victory in June 2018, when the Tokyo District Court issued an order approving a petition to begin civil rehabilitation. The petition was initially submitted in November of 2017.  Now, if the court approves the December deadline, the creditors will have one more month to submit proof of their claims.  Mt.

42402244,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3jiK,1542961841,"Lightning-Powered Blog Sees 20,000 Bitcoin Micropayments in 7 Months","Few projects have done as much to explore crypto micropayments as the year-old Yalls blog created by Lightning Labs developer Alex Bosworth.  From April through early November, Bosworth said, blog participants have processed nearly 20,000 invoices with the Lightning Network, a bitcoin scaling solution that makes micropayments feasible by keeping them off the blockchain, sidestepping network transaction fees.  It costs roughly one cent to read a Yalls article, half a cent to leave a comment on a post, and 10 cents to react to a post with an emoji. Publishing an article costs around 6 cents.  “One nice thing about micropayments is that it brings back anonymity to the web,” Bosworth told CoinDesk. “I’m really a fan of the idea that your identity doesn’t have to be tied to a username and password.”  Explaining that readers can tap into Yall’s Lightning node-and-channels system without a traditional subscription, like most paywalled outlets, he added:  “Maybe you don’t even have a wallet yet ... So you go to the Yalls app page, you can connect to it.”  So far readers have opened more than 118 Lightning nodes through this platform, many of which are now facilitating payment channels, in which small amounts are sent back and forth between users before final settlement on the blockchain.  This allowed contributors to post 170 new articles from July to early November 2018, while readers paid for 675 emoji reactions and 194 comments. Plus, writers have claimed their bite-sized crypto rewards at least 432 times during the same period, collecting the fees from readers for their articles.  “It’s pennies, so every single invoice is small,” Bosworth said.  As such, some node operators have been operating channels for several months, and according to Bosworth, earning roughly $5 a month on routing fees. While this hardly constitutes a business model for daily publishing, it highlights how engaged readership can contribute to a platform’s broader infrastructure.  Speaking to how media outlets often find participatory ecosystems difficult to moderate, since trolls and marketers can flood comment sections at no cost, he added:  “The micropayments help there, because then you don’t have robots or spam.”  Not yet a business model  Since Bosworth created this blog as a hobby, with a corresponding Lightning node on-boarding process, he doesn’t regularly track readers or payments and provided the April-November data to CoinDesk on request. He hasn’t marketed the site or solicited contributions either. And yet, it’s clear that bitcoin fans are engaging.  “In the beginning of the site there were problems keeping the node online. If the node died, you couldn’t read any articles or do anything on the site. I had to really babysit the node,” Bosworth said. “Over time, that feedback made its way back to LND [Lightning Network Daemon] and now the node is pretty stable.”  On the other hand, Bosworth acknowledged it will take years for this type of community funding to work for professional media outlets.  For starters, few people know how to operate a Lightning-friendly crypto wallet or node. General crypto-literacy is in short supply among mainstream audiences.  Plus, syncing up wallets and nodes with the site itself takes time to develop in-house.  According to Bosworth, readers were “pretty forgiving” when payments worth less than a penny had trouble processing. But “if you start to charge people like $20 a month or something, you have to provide a higher quality of service, that there’s never any bugs,” he said, adding that reliable infrastructure for one-click payments is the only way readers will use crypto micropayments for content on-the-go.  “If the infrastructure were there, so that there were less mental costs on the user to make that payment,” he said, “I think it could take off.”  Lightning image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/11/23/lightning-powered-blog-sees-20000-bitcoin-micropayments-in-7-months,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/58d8aaaa60e838a26cd6642b818bf0cb7e7375e4-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
