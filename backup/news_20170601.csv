42427590,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWT5h,1496352932,Ethereum Developers Stymie Blockchain Spammer's New Attack,"An unknown attacker that previously disrupted operations on the ethereum blockchain returned today, but so far to limited effect.  In an effort that was reminiscent of attempts last year that succeeded in slowing down activity on network, the owner of an address associated with the wave of spam attacks is sending commands meant to use up 'gas', ethereum's unit of computational power.  However, in what's perhaps a sign of how far developers have progressed in the last year, the attack was quickly spotted by the community.  Péter Szilágyi, a developer who works on the project's Go implementation, noted that a few ethereum developers, including ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and geth developer Nick Johnson, contributed to ""raising the alarm"".  Within an hour, the popular implementation released a new version called 'Hat Trick', complete with a security fix that changed the structure of some types of data that were being utilized in the new attack.  As of press time, the attacker had not sent transactions from the account for an hour.

NEC Corporation, the Linux Foundation-backed initiative announced today, has become a premier member of the group. Daichi Iwata, who leads the NEC's fintech business development office, is also joining Hyperledger's governing board.  NEC was among a group of companies to join the Hyperledger project in early 2016, just weeks after the effort first began. Hyperledger formally launched in December 2015, backed by firms including IBM, JPMorgan and the London Stock Exchange, and has since grown to include more than 100 startups and established companies among its ranks.  In statements, the firm indicated that its expanded work with Hyperledger would build on its past efforts focused around the tech.  ""We believe blockchain is a transformative technology and are committed to advancing its adoption by contributing our expertise and knowledge to the Hyperledger community,"" Osamu Fujikawa, who heads NEC's business innovation unit, said in a statement.  In addition to its work with Hyperledger, NEC has played a role in blockchain development within Japan's finance space. Last October, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank announced that it was exploring concepts around trade finance and asset custody, working with NEC and IBM’s Japanese arm to test prototypes.

42427571,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWSXh,1496340917,USV's Fred Wilson: ICOs Won't Displace VC Investors,"Venture capitalist and Union Square Ventures co-founder Fred Wilson isn't concerned about initial coin offerings, or ICOs, disrupting his line of work.  In a new blog post, Wilson – whose firm has invested in startups like Coinbase, Blockstack and Mediachain, as well as token hedge fund Polychain Capital – opined in light of the lightning-fast token offering conducted by bitcoin browser startup Brave.  The ICO model – through which startups can access funding by selling tokens via a blockchain network – is a dominant subject in the space today, given rampant speculation in the open markets (though others argue that the model largely fuels fraudulent behavior toward unwitting investors).  In his blog, Wilson opined that some observers see the rising number of ICOs as evidence of ""the end of the hated VC era of startup funding"". He pushed back on this notion, arguing that, for startups, venture rounds and ICOs can serve equally valuable and distinct purposes.  Indeed, USV itself has several startups in its portfolio that have pursued the model, and according to Wilson, others are set to follow. But he went on to say that ""not every company can do an ICO"", arguing that they are ""about an entirely different business model"" rather than a means to raise money.  ""The token that you sell in your ICO is the atomic unit of your business model,"" he wrote. ""You are selling some of it to raise capital but the main purpose of the token is to monetize your product or service.""  Wilson also argued that, compared with a token holder that might not be around for the long-term, some VCs are there to do just that. And while he acknowledged that, in his view, ICOs represent ""a legitimate disruptive threat"" to the VC model, ""they are not something I am nervous about and they are not something USV is nervous about"".  He went on to say:  ""We are excited about them when they are the right thing for our portfolio companies and we are encouraging those companies to use this new approach.""

42427580,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWSnh,1496331044,Bitcoin Miner BTCS Raises $1 Million in New Funding,"Publicly traded bitcoin miner BTCS, formerly known as Bitcoin Shop, has raised $1m in new funding, public records show.  According to a Form D published today by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the Nevada-based firm sold $1m in equity. In a separate filing, the startup said that the sale had taken place on 25th May, involving four institutional investors.  Yet a filing from March suggests that BTCS may be on shaky ground-revenue wise – an issue that has dogged the bitcoin mining startup in the past. BTCS said that it expects to report $361,000 in revenue for the year ending 31st December 2016.  ""The Company expects to report a substantial increase in loss from operations which at the time of this report has yet to be dermined[sic] due to the complex nature of the Company’s derivative liabilities,"" the firm added in the filing.  The notice comes days after the company's stock, as reported by Street Register Yahoo! Finance, saw its publicly traded stock jump in price, rising from roughly $0.05 to about $0.15 between 23rd and 25th May. The current price is averaging $0.08, according to data from Yahoo! Finance.

42427582,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWSrh,1496325616,Russia's Vnesheconombank Reveals Blockchain Product Strategy,"A state-owned development bank in Russia has revealed its plans for launching products built around blockchain.  Vnesheconombank, an institution backed by the Russian government, is focusing its efforts on the areas of project management and supply chain finance, according to a report by Sputnik International. The publication quoted Vnesheconombank's chairman, Sergey Gorkov, who appeared this week at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum.  What they're doing: Gorkov's comments, as quoted, reveal a kind of two-prong approach: developing institutional knowledge and pursuing applications – trade finance in particular – that have captured the attention of a wide range of financial firms worldwide.  Here's how Gorkov framed the bank's project management initiative, according to Sputnik:  ""When we started to think about how to manage projects efficiently, we realized that there is no platform. Everything that we had became obsolete. We realized that the blockchain is a good fundamental and qualitative platform for the future.""  He said that the bank had since pursued a pilot project centered around the use case, with further iterations to follow.  ""We are launching the first prototype in terms of project management this fall,"" he told the publication.  Why it matters: That a state-backed bank in Russia is moving to launch services around the tech is a notable one – but perhaps not an altogether surprising one given the pace of blockchain development in the country's finance sector.  The unveiling comes months after Russia's prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, called for more research into the tech by a pair of government agencies. Government officials also said earlier this year that they expect to develop blockchain-specific regulations, looking to an introduction by 2019.  That work comes as Russia's central bank drafts new rules around bitcoin and digital currencies, with an eye to regulate them as kinds of digital goods.

42427591,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWT7h,1496316604,The IRS is Due to Present its Digital Currency Strategy to Congress Next Week,"The US Congress wants answers from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) about its investigation into bitcoin tax avoidance – and they’re due by next week.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, a trio of lawmakers – Senator Orrin Hatch, Representative Kevin Brady and Representative Vern Buchanan – requested information about the IRS’s overall strategy toward digital currencies in a letter dated 17th May.  Those answers are due by 7th June, or next Wednesday. A representative for the IRS was not immediately available to comment when contacted about its plans to respond.  Notably, the three politicians took a negative tack toward a major IRS investigation targeting users of digital currency exchange Coinbase, writing in the letter:  ""[W]e strongly question whether the IRS has actually established a reasonable basis to support the mass production of records for half of a million people, the vast majority of whom appear to not be conducting the volume of transactions needed to report them to the IRS. Based on the information before us, this summons seems overly broad, extremely burdensome, and highly intrusive to a large population of individuals.""  The letter represents the latest wrinkle in the months-long battle by the IRS to obtain user records from the exchange.  The tax agency first went to court in November, seeking to issue a summons for access to Coinbase's user records. In the most recent development, a group of the startup's customers – who have requested anonymity – formally asked a US judge in California to intervene and stop the IRS effort in its tracks.  The lawmakers' official roles also point to the significance of their criticism of the IRS investigation: Hatch chairs the Senate’s Finance Committee, Brady leads the House of Representatives’ Committee on Ways and Means, while Buchanan serves as chair of the House committee’s Oversight Subcommittee.  And others have also previously criticized the IRS approach to digital currencies. Last November, the agency's own inspector general called for a strategic overhaul, chastising the IRS over its current practices.

42427573,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWSdh,1496309410,Bitcoin's 'Segwit2x' Scaling Proposal: Core Developers Strike Critical Stance,"Days after a widely-supported but contentious proposal for increasing bitcoin's transaction capacity was unveiled, technical details about the plan are coming to light.  It might not be particularly surprising if you're very familiar with bitcoin's long-standing block-size debate, but the tentative code for what's now known as 'Segwitx2' hasn't been especially well-received by the project's open-source developer community.  One so-called pull request from Bloq co-founder Jeff Garzik, for example, was greeted with a chorus of skeptical comments. Most were rather technical, coming from some developers who have worked on bitcoin for a long time, but the response seemed to boil down to: 'Why isn't the group using a safer method – one that many of us suggested earlier on?'  Some of the comments seemed to carry a mocking tone. ""This pull request is quite odd,"" Colu blockchain research lead Udi Wertheimer stated in his reply.  ""There are still no tests,"" another developer stated simply.  Still, Garzik, a former Bitcoin Core developer employed by bitcoin processor BitPay, welcomed the feedback, and later in the day, he responded on Medium. ""This was a starting point,"" he said, indicating his stance that the current implementation on GitHub is meant to be a work in progress.  Garzik added that he agrees with the feedback received and endorses making changes that enable the code to be compatible with the existing version of Segregated Witness (or SegWit) – a plan to scale the blockchain proposed by Bitcoin Core contributors in 2015.  ""If the outcome maximizes compatibility even more, re-uses existing testing even more, that is a win. Forward progress,"" Garzik wrote.  Fork fears  Yet for all the implied derision, this developer debate could be viewed as an example of 'collaboration' and peer review.  It's probably worth noting that none of the volunteer developers behind Bitcoin Core signed the ‘agreement’ on the proposal, first announced by investment portfolio company DCG last week. As hinted in the concerns above, this was partly because of technical concerns, and partly because some don't believe that a hard fork is necessary right now.  Capacity increases beyond SegWit, some argue, can be brought about in other backwards-compatible ways that don't risk kicking some network participants out of the system.  Once the proposal was released, and even long before then, developers had given technical feedback about how best to deploy a hard fork, which might explain a hint of bitterness from developers in recent discussions.  But, even if many of them aren't keen on details of the proposal, so far that hasn't stopped developers from trying to improve the implementation.  ""I wrote BIP91 to try and make the proposal more sane,"" said bitcoin developer James Hilliard, adding that, in his eyes, the current hard fork timeline is ""completely unrealistic"".  Others put more weight behind the proposal, which has backing from more than 60 companies and more than 80% of bitcoin's mining pool operators and firms.  ""I think we should look to build from the proposal and improve it,"" Blockstream CEO Adam Back said. Overall, Back has emerged as perhaps one of the more positive voices, with comments suggesting pushback from developers could create perception issues.  In particular, he's trying to steer interest toward a proposal called 'spoonnet', a branch of hard fork research from Bitcoin Core contributor Johnson Lau.  Bitcoin Core contributor Eric Lombrozo, who worked on SegWit code, had a similar collaborative take. ""I will work hard with [DCG founder and CEO Barry Silbert] to make this a success,"" he wrote on social media, though not without some caveats.  Too much, too soon?  The bottom line, though, is that many developers don't think the proposal is a good one.  Bitcoin Core contributor Bryan Bishop summed up the concerns the most succinctly:  ""I think that ultimately the [DCG] hard-fork is going to fail to safely transition the entire network. There's no replay protection. It's an unreasonably short timeline. It doesn't make use of the prior hard-fork research efforts.""  ""I think the entire industry needs to wake up and realize how long these things take,"" he added, arguing that peer review and testing takes a long time. (Other developers and bitcoin users have also questioned the six-month timeline.)  Perhaps the more important question though is: if the group addresses these technical concerns, would more developers support it?  The response, as usual, was complicated and mixed, with some expressing a desire to consider all the tradeoffs.  ""There's a general sentiment among Bitcoin Core developers that a tremendous amount of capacity can be gained by soft forks and backwards-compatible upgrades. I don't think that Bitcoin Core developers are going to rally around a hard fork in the near future, especially not one dictated by a closed-door secret meeting,"" Bishop said.  Developer Jonas Schnelli, known for the libbtc library, said he could possibly get behind a hard fork for a block-size increase if given more time.  ""I’m happy with SegWit2x if it could reduce to 80% without being incompatible to the existing [SegWit] implementation,"" Schnelli said. ""And do the [hard fork] later.""  Others simply don't think that it will work, seeming to treat it with the same interest as they treated Bitcoin XT or Bitcoin Classic – other hard fork proposals that failed (although this new effort has garnered more support).  Other options  Many developers expressed the sentiment that transaction capacity could be increased in other, perhaps safer, ways. For one, some tend to think that SegWit is a better solution on its own – without the accompanying hard fork, which could lead to a network split.  ""On SegWit2x, there is no technical reason to couple [Segwit] with a [hard fork]. Only political. And bitcoin was created to stay away from politics … this is why I mainly [do] not support it,” said Schnelli.  Bitcoin Core contributor Luke Dashjr was open to yet another recent proposal, called COOP, which combines a bunch of hard-fork research into one bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP), for safer deployment. But, he had reservations about increasing the block size so quickly.  Dashjr has actively promoted BIP148, a controversial backwards-compatible mechanism that’s been gaining momentum and that also has a deadline for activation, though some worry it too could result in a chain split.  He concluded:  ""Either way, BIP148 begins in August.""    Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG).
