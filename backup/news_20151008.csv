42398716,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgR9a,1444341240,BitFury Hosts Secret Block Chain Summit in Middle East,"Following the first Block Chain Summit this April – a widely publicized affair held at Sir Richard Branson's private Necker Island, lead event sponsor BitFury has organized a less talked about follow up in the United Arab Emirates.  Though information on the event is scarce, the event is currently ongoing, running from the 7th to 10th October in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the UAE.  According to posts by attendees such as BitFury advisor and former US Department of Justice official Jason Weinstein, the summit will include ""informal sessions and discussions"" on blockchain technology and its potential global impact.  No further information can be found about the event online, though BitFury did confirm it was hosting unidentified ""distinguished guests"" for the occasion.  BitFury CEO Valery Vavilov said in a statement:  ""The purpose is to continue educating global decision-makers on the power of blockchain technology.""  Vavilov suggested the event had already held talks on potential use cases for a public blockchain, how it could be used as a platform for the Internet of Things and whether it could be used to open up ""new market opportunities"".  BitFury did not disclose further information about the conference, or the reason for the secrecy surrounding the event.  Company representatives were unable to point to resources where more information was available, and at press time, its public communications channels were not promoting the event.  The conference comes on the heels of continued growth for the major bitcoin mining company, which recently announced it would invest $100m in a new 100MW data center to be based in the European nation of Georgia.

42398735,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgRPK,1444327563,Ripple Releases Interledger to Connect Banks and Blockchains,"Ripple Labs shortened its name to Ripple this week, a move which according to company officials, signals its products are now ""out of the lab"" and ready for use.  Long one of the more well-funded startups in industry, Ripple was arguably the first to focus on use cases for distributed ledgers, introducing an alternative ledger that deviated from bitcoin's method for consensus and featured its own unique digital currency, XRP, as early as 2012.  Since then, Ripple has increasingly put forth in its public messaging that it is seeking to realize an ""Internet of Value"", a term that denotes a time when money could move as quickly as information does today. As a building block for this future, Ripple has introduced the Interledger protocol (ILP), which intends to act as an arbiter for all types of ledgers, both those that are distributed and traditional centralized alternatives.  Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas explained that ILP itself is not a ledger, as it does not seek consensus toward any state. Rather it provides a top-layer cryptographic escrow system that allows funds to move between ledgers with the help of intermediaries it calls ""connectors"".  Further, ILP has no native token, so individual ledgers operating its protocol will still hold balances in their native units of account. Thomas contends such interoperability solves the issue of one specific payment network – be it Ripple or Visa – needing to reach global ubiquitousness.  Thomas told CoinDesk:  ""As long as your ledger supports [Interledger], you can participate in a payment and someone will be able to provide liquidity. It can be PayPal, Alipay, bitcoin, bank ledgers or Skype, anywhere people hold balances, they have a ledger.""  ""Interledger is a protocol in a true sense,"" VP of marketing Monica Long added. ""It creates ways for ledgers to interact. Bitcoin and Ripple are payment systems, [they] require everyone to adopt that system for users to interact.""  ILP is also a bid to offer Ripple's enterprise customers a solution that they argue maintains customer privacy, allowing users to keep aggregate transaction data off a public blockchain by using a connector to move funds between private versions of the Ripple network.  With this in mind, ILP features two modes – Atomic and Universal – with the former using a selected group of ""notaries"" to approve transfers and the latter an incentive structure to allow untrusted institutions to fill the role.  Ripple contends ILP is also easy for any of its partners to adopt. ""If you're PayPal, all you would need to do is add a new payment to your API,"" Thomas said.  Today, Ripple said Interledger works with any ledger or payments system and that open-source reference implementations are to be released later this month.  Crypto escrow  As described in the official white paper, connectors would facilitate transfers between ledgers, performing the same function that companies today might achieve with market makers when they exchange currencies for business purposes.  Unlike traditional systems, however, Ripple says ILP removes the need for transaction participants to trust that the connector will not lose or steal the money, meaning such exchange doesn't need to be protected by legal contracts.  ""Ledger-provided escrow guarantees the sender that their funds will only be transferred to the connector once the ledger receives proof that the recipient has been paid. Escrow also assures the connector that they will receive the sender’s funds once they complete their end of the agreement,"" the paper states.  In interview, Thomas suggested entities acting as connectors would also benefit from lower barriers to access.  ""In order to lower the barrier, the first thing you have to do is so the connector doesn't have to be trusted, they can provide liquidity without being that well-vetted,"" he continued.  More uncertain, Thomas suggested, was who might serve as a connector on ILP, though he said digital currency exchanges could fill this role. ""Those kinds of systems could adopt the tech and adopt that standard to expose their liquidity in a standardized way,"" he said.  In terms more familiar in the industry, Thomas compared ILP to Blockstream's sidechains project, which is seeking to extend the functionality of the bitcoin network by allowing bitcoin assets to be moved back and forth between altnerate cryptographic ledgers and the public blockchain.  ""Interledger is a complement to sidechains,"" he said. ""Sidechains is about how do you create these ledgers, ILP is putting them together. At ILP we're mostly thinking about if you're trying to connect a bitcoin sidechain and a PayPal ledger, how do you get from one place to another.""  W3C inspired  Ripple indicated that, while not affiliated with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), ILP grew out of its participation in its Web Payments Interest Group, which is seeking to develop standards for payments on the web.  Founded by World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee, W3C is a member organization that connects Internet industry stakeholders in an effort to develop open standards for everything from online payments to connected cars.  ""We've been involved [with W3C] since 2013, and we've been in touch with them based on the [ILP] idea, making a payments standard to create open, free payments,"" Thomas said.  Currently, Ripple indicated it is workshopping the protocol in a W3C community group, with the goal for it to potentially be considered as a standard for web payments.  Members include representatives from the National Association of Convenience Stores, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and Eris Ltd.  Yet, the development also seeks to help enhance the competitiveness of Ripple's products, which Thomas said banks have criticized due to potential issues with scalability. Thomas indicated that banks believe that, as with the introduction of the Faster Payments network in the UK, lower costs systems inevitably produce a higher volume of transactions.  ""When you bring costs down, volumes increase dramatically,"" Thomas said. ""The key to scalability is to have something that doesn't rely on one global system. That was also a great solution for some of the things W3C had.""  Thomas said that, as with sidechains in bitcoin, this would potentially enable ""horizontal scalability"" so that the global transaction system can increase its total processing power.  Testing ground  Thomas and Long also expressed their belief that ILP – by placing ledger systems side by side in a market – would serve to highlight which of these are the most efficient, something they suspect will be advantageous to distributed ledger providers.  In this light, Thomas suggested ILP will help promote other new Ripple products, including its Cross-Currency Settlement and FX Market Makinghttps://ripple.com/solutions/fx-market-making/ solutions, introduced on Tuesday.  Both solutions, Long said, are software products that interact with Ripple and are packaged together. Customers are able to purchase the products for a license fee. Ripple earns added revenue from integrations, and said pricing is currently customized depending on the partner.  The products also position Ripple and its asset XRP ""as a bridge"" that can reduce the cost for cross-border settlement, according to the company. Long said that the Cross-Currency Settlement product, for example, would improve the information available for end-consumers in the foreign exchange process for when removing privacy restrictions is beneficial.  ""Today, a bank can send payment instructions to a receiving bank, but there's no way for the recipient to send information back. The sending institution can't give its customer accurate pricing for the transaction and can't give the customer accurate confirmation that the payment got there,"" Long said.  Market validation  Given its status as an early partner for financial institutions, and the rising interest among these entities in blockchain and distributed ledger solutions, Long suggested Ripple sees developments in 2015 as a validation of its market strategy.  Long claimed Ripple has 30 banks currently experimenting with its technology, and that the announcement on how this is being used would be forthcoming.  Overall, Long spoke positively of developments such as R3's recent partnerships with major banks, indicating that both groups seem to be focused on separate use cases, Ripple on cross-border settlement and R3 more on interbank settlement.  With the changes in the space, Long positioned ILP as part of the expanding use cases in the ""distributed financial technology"" industry, a definition she feels best captures projects that are not wholly blockchain-based but seek goals concurrent with the community.  Long concluded:  ""Blockchains are a part of that, but it's about moving away from centralized systems.""

42398731,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgRNM,1444321053,Tunisia's Post Office Trials Crypto-Powered Payments App,"Tunisia's post office, La Poste Tunisienne, today revealed it is testing a crypto-powered payments app for 600,000 of its customers.  In partnership with startups Monetas and DigitUs, the hybrid service provider – which runs eDinar, Tunisia's official mobile money – will launch a multi-purpose app for the growing number of smartphone users in the North African nation.  CEO M Moez Chakchouk said in a statement:  ""La Poste is a very important and trusted institution and is at the heart of financial inclusion efforts in Tunisia. At La Poste we are on a transformation journey to modernize our services with innovative technologies and power the digital economy. Digital, Mobile and Internet, are all key components in this transformation.""  The app, which runs on Monetas' crypto-transaction platform, will launch as a pilot for ""friends and family"", the startup said. Once the integration is complete, it will be rolled out to 600,000 eDinar users.  Once live, La Poste customers will be able to action instant money transfers, remittances and purchases in-store and online via QR codes. It will also give them the ability to pay bills and even manage their government ID documents.  Transaction fees will be negligible – with the maximum amounting to under one third of a Dinar (11p). To prevent illegal use, issuance and circulation will be controlled by La Poste, Monetas said.  Digital notary  The app is the first public release from the Swiss software firm, which CMO Vitus Ammann claims has raised over $6m from angel investors to date.  Monetas calls its platform a ""cryptographically secured digital notary"" that records but never touches value. Monetas effectively offers white-label solutions to its partners, who will run it day-to-day to ensure they comply with AML and KYC standards in their market. In this case, this partner is DigitUs.  The firm is also looking to expand further into Africa over the next year, followed by Latin America and Asia – where smartphone penetration is surging but access to financial services remains poor.  Ammann told CoinDesk:  ""Monetas wants to focus on where we can have the greatest impact. Although Monetas software is intended to change the entire world, we believe the best place to start is where transaction costs are highest and access to banking is very low.""  He added:    ""We believe that mobile financial services is rapidly growing in the region, and Monetas software means individuals will prosper with a transaction platform that is magnitudes cheaper than any alternative, and able to operate across mobile networks and access new financial tools.""

42398725,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgRFU,1444316509,BNY Mellon: Blockchain Tech Could Transform Payments,"Blockchain technology could potentially transform payments, says a new report by American multinational banking corporation BNY Mellon.  Although the report – titled "" Innovation in Payments: The Future is FinTechhttps://www.bnymellon.com/_global-assets/pdf/our-thinking/innovation-in-payments-the-future-is-fintech.pdf""– notes that bitcoin may not survive in the long-term, the blockchain, it says, could help to reduce risk, transaction costs and improve speed, efficiency and transparency in the realm of payments.  The report goes on to assert that this process does not come without a set of challenges:  ""Indeed, blockchain technology presents a number of challenges that have yet to be resolved, such as managing the ever-increasing length of the chain itself (a problem referred to as 'blockchain bloat'), as well as how banks can reconcile the blockchain's use of pseudonyms (used as a means of ensuring anonymity) with regulators' requirements for transparency.""  ""So while there is clearly a great deal of potential around the blockchain, the exploration of the applicability of such technology to global corporate transactions is still in its infancy,"" the report continues.  Having noted the challenges, the report recommends that banks consider educating their key staff on developments, threats and opportunities in the payments business.  ""Digital currencies and the blockchain in particular have the potential to significantly shake up payments, and vigilance in this area is necessary to ensure banks are not caught 'on the black foot' and remain relevant, prepared and proactive,"" it adds.  Crypto at BNY Mellon  The publication of the report comes after BNY Mellon was announced as one of distributed ledger startup R3 CEV's new bank partners just last week.  In April, a Wall Street Journal report said that the bank's developers had been experimenting with bitcoin's open-source code as a part of a newly created corporate recognition scheme.  As part of the programme, employees would receive the so-called ""BK Coins"" after contributing to the bank's software development and would be able to redeem them for rewards such as gift cards.

42398726,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgRIR,1444301365,Stellar Now Open to Developers Following Network Upgrade,"Developers will now be able to build on Stellar's distributed network following an upgrade to its codebase which will also protect it against forking.  According to a blog post  by founder Jed McCaleb, the upgraded network is now more secure, scalable and modular than before.  He added:  ""The Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) optimises for safety rather than liveness when the network loses quorum – meaning the system is secure against forking. The Stellar Core code is now more comprehensible and elegant. Less than half the size of the previous codebase, it runs faster and uses less memory and disk space.""  Though McCaleb said there were a lot of ""great things"" about the new code – which has been nine months in the making – he highlighted two features which would allow the creation of simple contracts; the batching of transactions into a chain of operations and multisig accounts which can be signed with multiple keys and signers.  The upgrade comes after Stellar's network was forked in December last year, resulting in temporary disruptions to its transaction system.

42398730,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgRKP,1444297325,GemCoin Investors Seek $100 Million in Class Action Lawsuit,"An $100m class action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of victims of an alleged Ponzi scheme involving the fake cryptocurrency 'Gemcoin' days after a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) crackdown.  The complaint, filed Monday by The Liu Law Group at the Los Angeles Superior Court, claims the scheme defrauded thousands of Chinese and Chinese-American investors beginning in 2014. It follows an SEC complaint late last month and a seizure of assets from the company’s Arcadia headquarters on 1st October.  The documents name 10 defendants allegedly involved in the Gemcoin scandal, including Steven Chen, who oversaw the alleged scam, and John Wuo, former mayor of Arcadia City who has resigned from his position as a city councilman in the wake of the lawsuit filing.  Wuo appeared at functions hosted by US Fine Investment Arts (USFIA), the company behind Gemcoin at the center of controversy. In past statements, he called Gemcoin a “breakthrough in finance”.  The now-former city councilman is also reportedly under investigation by the California Fair Political Practices Commission, a state agency that oversees campaign finance activity. Wuo has denied any wrongdoing or involvement with USFIA.  In a letter  read aloud during a public hearing earlier this week in Arcadia, Wuo wrote that he was resigning ""due to personal and health reasons"".  The defendants are accused of operating an international Ponzi scheme that targeted residents in both China and the United States.  In addition to Chen and Wuo, the suit named as defendants Solomon Yang, Leonard Johnson, John Zhang and Kun Jiang, as well as four corporations believed to be owned by Chen: USFIA, the US-China Consultation Association Liaison/Consulting Services (UCCA), AmKey Inc, and Alliance Financial Group.  Virtually worthless  According to the complaint, Gemcoin was used as a ruse to entice investors. Investors were initially pushed to invest their own money in USFIA and solicit others to invest as well.  Bonuses including money and luxury goods were promised at a number of investor events conducted during the scheme’s period of activity. Investors were also given precious stones called ambers that were said to be of high value but upon appraisal were subsequently deemed to be virtually worthless.  Later, investors were told that they would receive a new cryptocurrency – Gemcoin – prior to an explosive surge in value.  The complaint states:  “Defendants themselves, and through their entities and agents, sold worthless assets called Gemcoins, which were purportedly backed by their own amber mines in the Dominican Republic. Defendants heralded Gemcoin as a new cryptocurrency they invited that would be revolutionary and grow exponentially in value, and that Plaintiffs could become early investors.”  “In reality,” the complaint continues, “there was never any cryptocurrency, and Defendants used their false cryptocurrency and false legitimacy of USFIA to defraud the public.”  USFIA executives made claims of government backing, allegedly telling investors that their venture had the explicit support of the Chinese government as well as US President Barack Obama.  Yang is said to have told investors that he was related to Chinese President Xi Jinping and was the son of a senior Communist Party official. He also allegedly claimed a networth of nearly 300 million euros. These claims, according to the complaint, were designed to give the impression of legitimacy.  The complaint goes on to outline how individuals part of the USFIA scheme had previously operated in China and Thailand. A law enforcement crackdown in October 2014 conducted by Chinese and Thai authorities resulted in the shutdown of that scheme, the complaint reads.  In a recent interview, attorney Long C Liu, who filed the suit on behalf of a single John Doe investor and is seeking class-action status for as many as 3,000 victims, said that investors were promised a functioning virtual currency but received nothing in return.  “Basically the whole idea of Gemcoins is a fiction. It’s made up. It’s a fabrication,” Liu told CoinDesk.  Wuo did not respond to a request for comment. A representative for USFIA could not be reached.
