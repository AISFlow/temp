42379141,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7n95B,1483571715,Sell Orders Slow Bitcoin Rally as All-Time High Remains Elusive,"Bitcoin prices surged today, breaching $1,100 and rising to their highest average since 2013 before falling back and surrendering gains.  The digital currency’s price managed to climb more than 10% during the day, according to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), however, datahttps://www.bfxdata.com/orderbooks/btcusd reveals that this rally ran into a high number of sell orders.  By 21:45 UTC, the percentage of sell orders made through cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex over the previous hour exceeded 75%, data from BFXdata showed.  The data point is the first sign that investor confidence could be waning after weeks of steady gains.  With this in mind, cryptocurrency fund trader Jacob Eliosoff told CoinDesk he believes that bitcoin is currently overbought, and that bitcoin could head back down as low as the $800 range.  Eliosoff said:  ""Given the spike over the last few days, I'd say the surprising thing is how few sell orders have been encountered.""  Overall, bitcoin prices rose to as much as $1,141.05 during the session, their highest total since 5th December, 2013, BPI figures reveal.  By the time they had reached this daily peak, bitcoin prices had come within $25 of their all-time high set on 30th November, 2013.  Shortly after, the digital currency declined to a local low of $1,087.53, before later climbing back to $1,108.64, BPI data shows.  Bull run  While it's unclear if this current ""bull run"" is over, several market analysts were quick to position the rally as an extension of improvements in bitcoin as a technology and an ecosystem.  ""This rally has been a long time coming. I think it's telling that right now the biggest problem facing bitcoin is how to deal with all the demand it is facing,"" former cryptocurrency exchange employee Zane Tackett said.  At one point during the day's trading session, GDAX, the digital currency exchange operated by startup Coinbase went down, a factor the company attributed to higher-than-average volumes.  Other exchange operators were quick to note that they believe the price appreciation is due to ""new money"" entering the market, while emphasizing that data shows overall sentiment is strong.  Whaleclub's Petar Zivkovski added:  ""A large majority of [our] traders are long.""

42379136,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7n8v7,1483562887,SEC Delays Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF Again,"By the time Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss receive a final decision from the SEC on their long-proposed bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), a new president will be leading the US.  Though an earlier 10th January deadline would have placed the decision by the SEC to approve or disapprove the Winklevoss brothers' request, paperwork filed today now extends the deadline to 11thMarch.  While the extension isn't a surprise, one industry observer thinks the transition of power may have made it essential.  Blockchain products lead at ARK Investment Management, Chris Burniske, said that SEC chair Mary Jo White's plans to leave with the departure of President Barack Obama are likely just the beginning of the internal changes.  Burniske told CoinDesk:  ""With high turnover like this, it's easy for things to be delayed. If there's not time to attend to this, then it will be pushed back.""  This is just the latest extension the SEC has given itself to come to a final decision regarding the Winkelvoss ETF.  Neither Cameron nor Tyler Winklevoss were able to comment on the decision due to restrictions from the regulator.  Yes or no  While this is just the latest delay, it's important to note that the series of possible extensions permitted by law is capped at 240 days from the initial submission date in June 2016.  Traditionally, the likely course the SEC will follow is either to approve the request or, in the days leading up to the decision, allow the brothers to bow-out gracefully.  Burniske concluded:  ""What will typically happen in scenario like this is either the SEC will approve or the proposed rule change will be withdrawn prior to a denial.""

42427212,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0kZh,1483553626,Bitcoin Price Within $25 of New All-Time High,"Bitcoin prices are up $100 on the day, having already shot past the $1,100 mark.  Markets have risen nearly 10% over the course of the day’s trading, according to data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), which hit a high of $1,141 at time of writing before falling back.  With the move, global exchange averages have inched closer to the BPI's all-time high of $1,165.89, set on 30th November, 2013, leaving them roughly $25 below that level.  The digital currency's price appreciated sharply after crossing the $1,100 line, quickly spiking to a high of $1,129.28, before meeting some resistance.  Bitcoin prices will likely face continued resistance as they approach the all-time high, as figures from BFXdata.comhttps://www.bfxdata.com/orderbooks/btcusd show that there are more sell orders than buy orders at many price points between $1,137 and $1,140.  In the last 24 hours, more than 60% of BTC/USD orders on Bitfinex have been buy orders, according to BFXdata. Adding potential resistance, however, is that this figure has now fallen below 50% for the last hour.  CNY-denominated markets are also notably up more than 23% for the day, currently averaging ¥8,219.03 after opening the day at ¥6,686.60. The price is currently at ¥7,293.60, BPI data shows.  Bitcoin prices have surged since the start of the year, building on major gains seen at the close of 2016. Average bitcoin prices across global markets exceeded $1,000 on 1st January and have been edging upwards since.

42427209,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0kVh,1483549168,US Treasury Insurance Advisors to Discuss Blockchain,"An advisory council to the US Treasury Department focused on the insurance market will discuss blockchain tech at a meeting later this week.  Set for tomorrow afternoon in Washington, DC, the Federal Advisory Committee on Insurance (FACI) will discuss a range of issues, according to publicly available materials, including the use of the tech in the US insurance market.  The government said of the hearing:  “In this meeting, the Committee will discuss a number of issues, including blockchain technology in the insurance sector, the changing auto safety landscape, and an overview of insurance fraud.”  The meeting is expected to be held at 1 PM ET. A livestream of the event will be broadcast here.  Current members  of the advisory council include representatives from a number of state insurance regulators in the US as well as private enterprises, including USAA, which began offering an integration with Coinbase to its user base in late 2015.  The meeting comes as insurers worldwide have moved to explore products and services utilizing the tech.  In October, a group of European insurance and reinsurance firms moved to establish an industry body aimed at collaboratively testing use cases. The following month, a UK-based insurance trade group launched a blockchain research effort of its own  Major insurers like John Hancock, MetLife and Allianz, among others, have moved to test the tech on their own as well.

42427202,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0kHh,1483545625,New Bitcoin Software Update Boasts 55 Fixes,"Bitcoin's eighth birthday was marked by a new software update.  Though all eyes may have been on the escalating price, Tuesday's software upgrade (to version 0.13.2) is the latest of many ""minor version releases"" published by the volunteer developer group known popularly as Bitcoin Core.  It might not be as big of a release as say, 0.13.0, but it rounds up a number of bug and performance fixes, including an upgrade that will allow the built-in wallet to react to memory pool (mempool) changes more appropriately. Other improvements include increased block relay speed on the network and changes that aim to make it easier for miners to adopt SegWit, the scaling solution that's been particularly contentious lately.  Major releases add additional features, while minor releases generally polish on those releases by way of bug and performance fixes making the software more robust (although consensus rules are also sometimes added in minor releases).  In total, 28 contributors made 55 changes merged into the release.  Similar releases often need a few rounds of testing (which each manifest in a new ""release candidate""), but since no problems were reported since the first release candidate, the developer group packaged up and distributed it.  To make the upgrade (which developers suggest doing for a performance boost), users need to turn off their full node, install the latest version, then restart it. Not everyone upgrades to the latest software, but roughly 53% of nodes are now running version 0.13.0 or newer.  SegWit stalling  Meanwhile, the situation for the last release is arguably not ideal.  While an upgrade featuring the SegWit activation code was released in late October, only about 25% of miners have signaled support for the change, far from the 95% that will trigger the update.  Yet, despite this slow progress, this release indicates that developers are continuing to update the code.  Along those lines, Bitcoin Core is continuing work on the next major version, 0.14.0, which could be released as early as March 2017.  Generally, protocol developers appear to be focused on privacy and scalability improvements in the coming year.

42427217,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0kjh,1483542007,Why 2017 Will Prove 'Blockchain' Was a Bad Idea,"Ferdinando Ametrano teaches Bitcoin and Blockchain Technologies at Politecnico di Milano and Milano Bicocca University. He was chairman of Scaling Bitcoin 2016 and is also former Head of Blockchain and Virtual Currencies at Intesa Sanpaolo bank.  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Ametrano argues that, despite the hype around enterprise blockchain technologies, achievements in the bitcoin community have been greater.  Another year goes by, another intense chapter in the history of the bitcoin and blockchain ecosystem.  There has been no shortage of folklore and drama: 2016 started with the ""whiny ragequit"" of Bitcoin Core developer Mike Hearn, who shortly after joining banking consortium R3CEV declared bitcoin a failure and sold all his coins.  It's worth noting the price of bitcoin has now ended 2016 near a three-year high.  Elsewhere, the con artist Craig Wright claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, providing laughable cryptographic proofs to bamboozle and discredit reputable people. The unmissable yearly exchange heist this time hit Bitfinex, its $66m theft becoming notable also for the lengths it went to to avoid bankruptcy.  Major consortia competed for the membership of financial institutions and technological players, with Hyperledger beating R3 100 to 70 – numbers implausible for any kind of sensible action plan but representative of the overblown blockchain hype and the widespread fear of missing out.  People have been advocating blockchain as a magic wand to solve many global problems (like securing nuclear weapons and managing the power grid); I have been compelled to humbly add that its potential at scrambling eggs should not be underestimated.  In with DLT  Actually, as knowledgeable people are fully aware, blockchain has not been really cool in 2016. The 2014 champion, bitcoin was dethroned by blockchain in 2015, but this year the debate has crowned distributed ledger technology (DLT) as the relevant topic.  Instead of pondering why blockchain without bitcoin (or another native token) made no sense (and admitting that blockchain was just abused as a snake-oil marketing buzzword), many of the projects originally touted to ""bring blockchain to finance"" flippantly shifted to DLT.  Nobody has really figured out what this DLT chimera is about or which problem it should solve. (Yet, we have been told it could reduce banks' infrastructural costs by $20bn). Even the European Securities Market Authorities (ESMA) wonders about its applicability.  The ESMA consultation paper issued in June posed many sensible specific questions: unfortunately most of the answers received were generic rhetoric exercises. Adding insult to injury, even when it comes to derivatives trading and clearing (where ESMA is confident DLT cannot be applied), unfunded claims about interest rate swaps as smart contracts on DLT obfuscate the debate.  Last but not least, no DLT proposal has really delved into how to implement cash-on-the-ledger for effective delivery vs payment or, even more crucially, how to reach decentralized consensus.  Bitcoin and blockchain is more a cultural paradigm shift than just a technology. It is all about decentralization, so the attempt of intermediaries to repurpose it appears quite ludicrous.  As pointed out by Mainelli and Milne:  ""Current interest in mutual distributed ledgers has established significant momentum, but there is a danger of building unrealistic expectations [...] Understanding of the technology lags well behind the hype [...] ‘Blockchain’ technology seems to promise major change for capital markets and other financial services, but few can say exactly how or why.""  Given that bitcoin and blockchain is at the crossroads of game theory, cryptography, data networking, and monetary theory, a proper understanding of the subject is in fact quite rare.  One can consider the blockchain as the auditable immutable log of database updates: it can be used to reach the current database consensus state starting from an empty state (the UTXO database in the bitcoin case).  But how to make this log at least tamper-evident in a distributed network has often been neglected, and sometimes stultified, as with the proposal to make the blockchain rewritable. Decentralized consensus seems so far very hard to reach without the economic incentives provided by a blockchain native digital asset like bitcoin.  Partial solutions have been proposed in some special configurations of DLT – eg: by Digital Asset for the Australian Stock Exchange post-trade system.  Here a shared ledger registering the log of (the hash values of) all trades is generated, updated and cryptographically signed by a central counterparty in a distributed, but by no means decentralized, environment. The notary service of the central counterparty can hardly be generalized to a decentralized framework, unless ironically resorting to the bitcoin blockchain (the most secure one, since the effort and cost for its manipulation is prohibitive) as notary.  All hail notarization  We are back now to the most notable application of blockchain beyond bitcoin: timestamping, anchoring and notarization.  A generic data set (a file, a database, the status of a transaction network) can be hashed to produce a short unique identifier. Such a digital fingerprint can be associated to a bitcoin transaction and hence registered on the blockchain. The blockchain immutability then provides robust non-repudiable timestamping that can always prove, without doubt, the existence of that data set in that specific status at that precise moment in time.  This generic processhttps://eternitywall.it/notarize is even undergoing some standardization to achieve third-party auditable verification. This is what could be called databases on crypto-steroids: in the disruptive bitcoin nuclear explosion, applied cryptography will be the radioactive fallout driving database evolution. Or even better ""what jewelry is for gold, timestamping and notarization could be for bitcoin: not essential, but effective at leveraging its beauty"".  We are touching the crucial point here: How can so many miss the point about the importance of bitcoin as digital gold?  For the first time, we have a scarce digital asset which can be transmitted, but not duplicated (ie: spent, not double-spent): this is the groundbreaking achievement by Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin could prove to be digital gold: as relevant as physical gold has been in human history and in the development of trade, money and finance.  It has already realized a resilient permissionless transaction network and has appreciated more than 900x in less than six years.  How can people possibly care more for the sub-par append-only sequential data structure known as blockchain instead?  To the rescue  This year, central bankers at least have been better at recognizing bitcoin's relevance.  Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank (ECB), wrotehttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/legal/pdf/en_con_2016_49_f_sign.pdf to the EU Parliament:  ""The reliance of economic actors on virtual currency units could in principle affect the central banks' control the supply of money with potential risks to price stability [...] Thus [... EU legislative bodies....] should not seek to promote a wider use of virtual currencies.""  Sheng Songcheng, member of the National People's Congress and Director of the Investigation and Statistics Department of the People’s Bank of China, recently issued similar remarks.  Songcheng said:  ""With the expansion of the use of private digital money, sovereign money use will gradually decline, which will reduce the monetary authority of the sovereign currency control. At the same time, the influence of monetary policy control on the supply and circulation of fiat money will also decline and become unstable, which will weaken the effectiveness of monetary policy and distort the transmission mechanism.""  It seems like they are scared by the likelihood of the scenario where private money competes with fiat money; the dream illustrated by Nobel laureate Friedrich von Hayek in ""Denationalisation of Money"" finally becomes true, breaking the millenary government monopoly of money.  Through market competition, better money will eventually prevail, but the Emperor is mad at the idea of money without his stamp of approval.  Bitcoin's brilliance  In 2016, private cryptocurrencies have been vying for the top spot, with ethereum establishing itself as the most plausible bitcoin alternative.  This Hayekian scenario is to be loved, and indeed a lot has been learned by this fierce competition. Yet, I believe the only conclusion is that bitcoin has come out on top.  The frequent ethereum network outages (provoked by DDoS attacks) have proved how brilliant the bitcoin development team has been in managing its network for eight years without similar problems.  Further, the disagreement between alternative ethereum implementations has forked the ethereum blockchain, proving how essential it is for a cryptocurrency to have just one reference implementation. The DAO hack proved how Turing completeness is excessive hubris and how wise it was for bitcoin to be conservative when it comes to its scripting language.  In my view, the subsequent split between ethereum (ETH) and ethereum classic (ETC) weakened ETH and proved how dangerous it is to have a contentious hard fork, and how healthy it is for bitcoin development not to be driven by any “benevolent dictator”.  The ethereum failures have contributed in some fashion to lessen the bitcoin debate about a hard fork for bigger block size.  While still supported by a significant vocal minority, the issue is not as rampant as it was at the end of 2015. Especially now that Segregated Witness (SegWit, the soft-fork aimed at fixing the malleability problem and providing many other improvements) could be activated, allowing also for an effective block size increase.  SegWit  is crucial for many possible future developments and its adoption would mark a turning point in the bitcoin history.  Nonetheless, even if the bigger-block minority will stop it, some celebration should be in order because bitcoin is proving once again how resilient it is to manipulation attempts, even one advocated by a core development team with a brilliant track record.  But... fungibility  That's not to say bitcoin doesn't have big issues ahead.  As noted during the 2016 developer conference in Milan, this year has been mostly about two issues: the off-chain scaling approach proposed by Lightning Network and the fungibility and privacy issue.  Lightning Network  avoids the extreme security of having all nodes validating all transactions: it secures off-chain transactions with a cryptographic smart contract that relies on the main blockchain for dispute resolution.  Fungibility is the requirement for all bitcoin to be equal: an atom of physical gold is indistinguishable from any other gold atom, whatever its history. Unfortunately this is not really true for bitcoin, allowing for bitcoin of different value and legitimacy depending on their pedigree.  While often underappreciated, this is probably the most relevant limit in the current bitcoin implementation, but it can be mitigated through mixing techniques (in my view Joinmarket and TumbleBit are promising approaches that might lead to effective improvement).  It is evident here that the obfuscation needed for transaction privacy would ensure fungibility and vice versa.  It is again the Hayekian scenario of competing currencies, this time the rise of Monero and ZCash (and of the MimbleWimble idea), that has proven how relevant the demand for fungibility and privacy is. Indeed, how crucial the privacy debate has been represented by the FBI and Apple's encryption dispute, the Yahoo mass surveillance incident, the UK Investigatory Powers Act, the IRS's Coinbase data request, etc.  This mass surveillance approach is really despicable: on one hand, it is ineffective because criminals will be able to patch cryptographic backdoors adopting a second-layer robust encryption; on the other hand, it will put at risks everybody’s privacy, allowing criminals to use the backdoor to spy on the honest people.  Bitcoin will now have to prove its ability to grant financial privacy.  Last straw  Yet, all in all, 2017 might be the final year in the pump-and-dump scheme of blockchain-without-bitcoin , the last-ditch effort to prove the marginal utility of databases on crypto-steroids.  Probably some smart contract hype will clutter the debate, thanks to the smartest ones among the fools trying to outsmart even the smart contract inventor.  But most of this fuss will finally leave center stage, allowing for the 2018 return of (a hopefully more fungible) bitcoin.  Digital gold effective in the defence of privacy and at freeing money from state and central banks monopoly, bitcoin might bootstrap new monetary systems: it might be surpassed by more advanced forms of money, as happened to physical gold, without becoming obsolete. And it will ignite new economic and trade systems: for the first time really global, borderless, and inclusive.  In the meantime, please fasten your seatbelt for another rollercoaster of a year. To the moon!

42427220,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0knh,1483538436,Charlie Shrem's Post-Prison Blockchain Firm Sees Gold in Garbage,"Charlie Shrem wants to use blockchain technology to move millions of gallons of waste through the state of Michigan – six million gallons to be precise.  In a prospectus published today, the controversial and convicted founder of the shuttered bitcoin exchange service BitInstant revealed his intentions to use an ethereum-based platform to let investors around the world buy a slice of the undisclosed waste management firm.  While Shrem's investment platform could prove just the shot in the arm the 20-year-old company needs to become a leader in the $75bn US waste management industry, American investors won't be allowed to participate. Nor will investors in the UK, thanks to concerns about the nation's extensive regulatory requirements.  Instead, the only people who will be allowed to participate in the first-of-its kind investment vehicle will be those who fall outside these jurisdictions.  But blockchain won't simply be used to let investors back the companies vetted by Shrem's firm, Intellisys Capital. The tech will also be used to help turn those investments into highly profitable companies by streamlining back-end procedures.  Assuming all goes to plan.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Shrem explained the double-role he believes blockchain can play to modernize the entire investment industry.  Shrem said:  ""What we wanted to do was have a synergy plan where we can look at these companies and see how we can integrate blockchain technology into these companies and how can we save these companies money, reduce their cost, or use the technology to make them more money.""  With the epic failure of another blockchain-based investment platform known as The DAO, that last year disintegrated after a hack drained millions of dollars-worth of the currency, what not to do is now much more clear.  But as the launch date of a $25m fundraising round to invest in the unique portfolio rapidly approaches, the way forward is still only slowly coming into focus.  Different from The DAO  A key difference between The DAO and the fund – called Mainstreet Investment LP – is that while the former was primarily an experiment with blockchain itself, Shrem considers the latter an experiment with the technology's application in business.  He describes himself as ""frustrated"" with the proliferation of token-based fundraising rounds, or ICOs, as a way to build new technology, when he says the existing technology in bitcoin and ethereum are more than sufficient to support the construction of imaginative new applications.  So, instead he partnered with a member of the established investment community, Jason Granger, formerly of The Granger Group, to build what the duo calls the ""first securitized blockchain asset,"" called a Mainstreet Investment Token, or MIT.  Also unlike The DAO, the token owners themselves don't have any say in the investments, but rely on the due diligence performed by Granger and Intellisys's advisors to select what they can only hope are the best possible investments in US middle market companies.  Details of the fund were first published in December in its ""Initial Token Offering Memorandum"", though CoinDesk has learned that some crucial components of that memorandum have changed.  Based in the Cayman Islands, Mainstreet plans to raise its first round of capital over a 60-day period beginning 23rd January – a week later than originally planned. Tokens will be issued on two separate exchanges, one in China and another elsewhere, with know-your-customer diligence being performed by the hosting platforms to help ensure that only investors outside the US and UK participate.  MIT tokens that are not sold will be ""burned"", meaning they can't be used and no one involved in the development of the company will be awarded tokens in advance.  Instead, 10% of the MIT fund has been set aside for operational expenses, including paying Shrem and Granger's salaries. To increase security, $1m of the funds will be held in a wallet connected via the Internet for rapid deployment as necessary, with the remaining funds stored in a so-called ""cold wallet"", or digital currency account not connected to the internet.  While these measures are designed to enhance the security of the dual smart contract system that receives funds and disperses dividends, it may not be perfect.  In order to avoid the fate of The DAO, Intellisys said it is working with an international public accounting firm that will audit the entire portfolio. Intellisys has also contracted two outside code audit firms to trouble-shoot the smart contracts and has delayed its initial launch by a week to offer bounties, or rewards to those who might identify bugs in the code.  Shrem said:  ""We will open source that before the token sale, and I will say, if you do find anything, I will handsomely reward you before the token sale.""  Build, measure, learn  But it's not just the code that could be subject to change. The structure of the fund itself has already been modified and further changes could occur prior to the official launch.  After the initial publication of the investment memorandum, Shrem and Granger received feedback on how the possible benefits of the fund were scheduled to be divvied out.  Originally, 70% of the benefits would accrue to Intellisys and 30% to the stakeholders.  But following exchanges with potential investors, the fund itself is now structured so that 50% of the carried interest earned goes to Intellisys, with another 50% to be divided among the token holders, according to confidential documents provided to CoinDesk.  Further, the percentages vary based on other portfolio conditions.  ""We all know that not every investment is going to go exactly according to plan,"" said Granger, who owns three-quarters of the firm to Shrem's one-quarter stake. ""And as long as we're making sure that we're covering them first, we'll carry any losses forward and any expected returns forward and be able to pay that back so they're always made whole.""  Shrem described the reasoning behind the change:  ""We looked at the risk-reward ratio as levers and we wanted to make sure we got the levers correct.""  Profit from waste  Another key difference between The DAO and the Mainstreet fund is that details about the potential portfolio have been released prior to the crowdsale.  Today, Intellisys released exclusively to CoinDesk the prospectus for its first potential investment. Importantly, it is not a blockchain firm, but if backed, would be turned into a blockchain firm, a model they hope others might repeat in the future.  Though the name of the Michigan-based waste management company isn't yet being made public, the prospectus describes it as having been around for about 20 years. In addition to pumping six million gallons of waste last year, it has 570 portable toilets and is positioned in the top 10% of the largest waste management firms in Michigan, according to the prospectus.  Granger told CoinDesk the waste management firm is operating at ""roughly""40% margins of cash flow to operations.  To grow the firm, Granger plans to use part of the $25m he intends to raise via the tokensale to acquire between 60 and 100 independently owned firms over five years.  Based on the prospectus, Shrem and Granger expect the strategy of consolidating local companies to result in a 7.5% price increase to all services, and increased cash flow of approximately 15% after paying off debts. And that's without any savings that might result from moving part of the workflow to blockchain smart contracts.  ""That is kind of, I'll call it, our shining star,"" said Granger. ""That we want to be able bring into the portfolio and continue to grow that into a national company over the next 10 years.""  Specifically, Shrem said Intellisys could use the ethereum blockchain to help the waste management firm cut costs on the logistics of managing their fleet of trucks, streamline accounting and perhaps pay employees.  Shrem said:  ""We've got to look at, where are their major costs? Where are they spending a lot of money and where can they save money, potentially using blockchain technology?""  Double-edged Charlie  While investing always includes an element of risk, the Mainstreet fund is unique for more than just its business model. But the possible rewards are also immense.  In spite of Shrem's industry contacts (which have helped the young company build a board of advisors including Tradehill's Jared Kenna and Airbitz's Paul Puey), his past convictions for money laundering-related crimes could spell trouble for the project.  As a result, Shrem and Granger hired cryptocurrency lawyer Marco Santori, a partner at Cooley LLP, to write a letter of opinion on the possible impact of Shrem's history on the business.  Santori declined our request to see the letter, citing both attorney client and work product privilege. But Shrem summed up its contents as advising him to go ""full-steam ahead"".  ""The message we got back was the risk is very low, if not at all,"" Shrem said.  Staying free  But that doesn't mean they aren't being cautious.  Shrem said what he missed most while in jail was a ""real cup of coffee"", something he doesn't intend to go through again.  As already noted, to help keep on the right side of the law, US investors are currently disqualified from participating, and Shrem and Granger are optimistic that planned actions in the state of Delaware might pave the road for eventual changes at the SEC level.  Also possible in the future are implementations similar to Airbitz, which used Title III of the SEC's US JOBS Act to raise $1.15m from five investors in exchange for actual equity in the company.  What's at stake is nothing less than the future venture capital investment itself.  While a total of $58.8bn was invested in US companies in 2015, only about $1bn was invested in blockchain companies.  To give an idea of the potential growth, in 2016, token-based fundraising rounds using similar technology as Mainstreet resulted in a meager $232m raised from 66 firms – the lion's share of which came from The DAO, according to analytics from Smith + Crown.  But until the regulatory uncertainty that concerns Shrem and others is straightened out, firms like Intellisys are being advised to play it safe and self-regulate.  Shrem concluded:  ""It's too much of a gray area in blockchain securities in the US right now. Maybe down the road, when it's become a lot more clear, we can open it up. But at this point, the risk assessment is too high to keep it open to the US market. But you know what? I don't want to go back to jail.""  Editor's note: An earlier version of this story based on an interview with Charlie Shrem reported that the fund was being sold via an SEC exception to Reg D, known as rule 506. The company has since clarified that is not the case.

Announced today  , Du will partner with NMC Healthcare to implement electronic health records using blockchain tech. The aim, according to the firms, is to bring data integrity, security and trust to the relationship between health providers and patients.  Carlos Domingo, chief new business and innovation officer at Du, sought to stress these benefits in remarks, stating:  ""By digitizing all health records, and putting them in blockchain technology, data can be shared and distributed across all hospitals. We are looking at fully digitizing the health system with blockchain technology to assure data integrity with zero error and guarantee end-to-end accountability of the patients’ records.”  The project, which will see the firms collaborate with Estonian blockchain technology startup Guardtime, is slated for final delivery early next year.  Overall, the move is the latest for Du, one of two authorized telecom providers in the UAE.  The company first announced its proposed focus on health records in June, unveiling its effort as part of a showcase for Dubai's government-backed Global Blockchain Council. Launched in early 2016, the group boasts more than 30 local businesses as members.

42427221,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0kph,1483531229,Preparing for Blockchain Regulation in the Post-Obama Era,"Juan Llanos  is a seasoned risk, blockchain and financial compliance expert and certified anti-money-laundering specialist. He writes about risk and virtual currencies on his blogContrarianCompliance.com.  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Llanos provides a broad look at the trends impacting global regulation in the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors.  Looking back on 2016, it feels as though most regulators around the world took a year-long vacation from the blockchain and cryptocurrency space.  To be fair, apart from dealing with the anxieties typical of an election year (or the anti-globalization times we are living in), they were listening and learning. The amount of collaboration and mutual education between government and industry over the past year has been remarkable – and for good reason.  Whether on the policymaking, the rulemaking or law enforcement side of government, regulators are grappling with a wave of innovation that is challenging assumptions, beliefs and positions.  Indeed, there's a long list of questions to consider.  Are blockchains and crypto-tokens attractive to criminals or a threat to national security? Can the new financial intermediaries that use them use the same compliance tools and techniques as traditional financial institutions? Is it possible to evade taxes or break other laws with them? Can better information-sharing and monitoring systems be built?  Are blockchains simple to understand and safe for consumers and businesses to use? What are the risks of financial loss to consumers and investors? If ledgers are public or shared across multiple parties, can privacy and confidentiality be protected and preserved? How far can we go in letting innovators experiment with them? Did company X break any laws with that initial coin offering? What is a smart contract?  Are existing regulatory safeguards adequate and appropriate? Can the same regulations be applied to both closed and centralized decentralized technologies? Can our own oversight of financial intermediaries be streamlined?  How do we enforce our laws without third-party intermediaries? We barely can afford to supervise thousands of entities, how are we going to supervise millions?  Before we unpack these questions, let's first take a step back.  A year of leniency  That's not say that nothing happened in 2016. Yet, compared to previous years (and against the expectations of many), government intervention in the cryptocurrency space was almost non-existent.  In January, we learned that the Manhattan District Attorney had shut down over 70 bitcoin scams. Not much else happened throughout the year on the law enforcement side, except for a similar crackdown in Taiwan in May.  A month later, a different type of enforcement action was taken by the CFTC against Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange Bitfinex. The reason was a series of technical trading violations that cost the exchange $75,000 in civil penalties and an operational retooling that may have also introduced looming vulnerabilities.  On the famously confusing US state-by-state licensing regime front, we learned in August that California had completely overhauled its proposed digital currency bill, effectively kicking the can down the road till next year. In early December, the bitcoin community welcomed the innovation-friendly policy and a new Digital Currency Regulatory Guidance presented by regulatory agencies in Illinois.  Finally, in what was probably the biggest shocker of the year, in mid-November, the IRS requested a massive amount of user and transaction data from cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase as part of a taxpayer investigation. (A few months before, the IRS had received a slap on the wrist for not enforcing cryptocurrency tax compliance).  Elsewhere in the world, Russia and Italy were also pondering taxation of cryptocurrencies.  Two big market failures over the summer, however, The DAO debacle and the Bitfinex hack, have yet to elicit a visible reaction from a regulator.  Many of us suspect that will happen in 2017.  Taming a complex animal  When looking at how this will change, I find it useful to first make a distinction between the three distinct yet interconnected elements that make up a modern nation's regulatory toolkit: policy, regulation and enforcement.  Also, it is worth bearing in mind that regulation is generally industry-specific (aviation, pharma, financial services), activity-based (market making, money transmission, deposit-taking) and jurisdiction-dependent (each country).  Policy objectives are fairly harmonized across the globe and relatively slow to change. Consumer protection, safety and soundness, stability, transparency are examples of policy objectives in the financial services world.  In a different industry, say aviation, a policy goal would be aircraft security and passenger safety.  Regulation and enforcement tend to be more jurisdiction-specific and malleable to special special-interest influence. Regulatory authority emanates from broad statutes generally prompted by catastrophic market failures, such as the Great Recession, or events, such as 9/11 or the 2004 tsunami in Thailand.  Given its dominant position, the US will impose and enforce rules on trade and national security more forcefully than, say, Argentina, which may not have any.  Naturally, there are differences in approach and attitude towards policy, regulation and enforcement among different political factions.  If formally flawed, regulation can be excessively prescriptive (heavy on detail and length) and difficult to comply with and enforce. If substantively flawed, regulation can have serious unintended consequences: hamper economic growth, and encroach upon people’s freedoms.  Arguably, until now, serious FinTech innovation does not seem to have been a public policy priority in the US under either party.  If the US has reluctantly begunhttps://www.occ.treas.gov/topics/bank-operations/innovation/special-purpose-national-bank-charters-for-fintech.pdf to contemplate alternative licensing mechanisms for FinTech startups, it is a salutary unintended consequence of the apparent ""FinTech innovation Cold War"" triggered by the UK, Singapore and Switzerland.  Reading Trump's tea leaves  But, trying to predict the policy direction and enforcement attitudes of the Trump administration is a challenge. The reason is that, in his own words, he is ""so unpredictable"".  Yet, Trump aside, change is likely. The US now risks losing its dominant position unless it too reluctantly addresses its ""regulatory debt"" issues and adapts its regulatory frameworks.  Against this backdrop, both Trump and the Republican Congress are expected to take a laissez-faire stance on regulation. The questions are what sectors or policy objectives will be the new priorities, and whether enforcement would also be loosened up. Tax compliance enforcement is probably a good candidate for lax treatment.  Elsewhere, the massive set of financial regulations known as Dodd-Frank is perceived to be heavy-handed and misguided, and Republicans already have a plan to replace it. The elimination of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, created by that statute, would benefit the blockchain industry, but would leave the individual states as the sole prudential regulators of money transmitters.  This quiet spell is probably the closest to a regulatory sandbox that we, US residents, will ever get to experience.  Yes, I do not hold my breath waiting for a financial services sandbox to become a reality in the US. Not even in the Trump administration, and not for bitcoin or open blockchains, at least.  My sense is that, for the foreseeable future, Trump will have bigger fish to fry.  The heaviest and sharpest sword  AML (anti-money laundering) and CFT (countering the financing of terrorism) regulations are the most harmonized globally, and the most difficult to change or ignore. They are, however, selectively enforced based on the authority and resources of each jurisdiction.  Based on his campaign promises, Trump is bound to step up law enforcement and national security efforts.  We would all do well to remain vigilant and concerned about Trump's foreign policy. A jingoistic policy and enforcement attitude is bound to engender hostility and retaliation. Further, the proven association of cryptocurrencies to terrorism could be catastrophic for bitcoin and privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies.  This would change the status quo, as bitcoin has arguably had an easy ride over the last few years.  Granted, it still carries the negative stigma of its association with scams and criminal use. But, it remains to be seen how long it will take for the US government to begin to consider why it is selectively enforcing regulation in the general finance sector and not in the cryptocurrency space.  Hope for the best, prepare for the worst  In this climate, it's wise to remember that regulation is inevitable, yet valid, while compliance is onerous, but valuable.  There is always a positive outcome intended by a piece of regulation. I encourage entrepreneurs to focus on attaining those outcomes and policy goals first (spirit over letter) and to strengthen their product and organization from within (substance over form).  In my view, that path forward is along the lines of legitimacy-building and automation.  There has never been a better time to rethink and redefine policy and regulations, to influence and allow oneself to be influenced. I encourage entrepreneurs and regulators to build bridges and collaborate to jointly find answers to the difficult questions above.  Both the industry and the government need it to be on the right side of history.

42427219,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0klh,1483529591,"A $2,000 Bitcoin (and 9 Other 2017 Blockchain Predictions)","Ajit Tripathi is a director of FinTech and digital at PwC, a startup mentor at Startupbootcamp and an avid blockchain enthusiast.  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Tripathi issues his predictions for the blockchain industry in the year ahead.  The opinions expressed in this article are the personal opinions of the author at the time of publication and not of their employer. While these opinions may require significant computing power to change, they are certainly not immutable.  2016 might have been a good year for technology – but it was a difficult year for much else.  The UK took a step back on free trade and immigration by voting to leave the EU (causing a fragile EU to teeter toward dissolution); the US elected a president whose transition saw daring squabbles with a country that owns over a trillion in its debt; each of the BRICs shot themselves in the foot (Brazil with corruption, India with demonetization, Russia with Crimea and China with non-performing loans); and the Middle East continued to burn like an oil well on fire.  None of these disasters show signs of letting up in 2017.  As the major currencies of the world start to tumble in 2017, the flight to quality will lead most investors back into the safety of gold. Some return-hungry ones will seek to exploit market inefficiencies and digital assets like bitcoin will draw a large enough segment of these investors, pushing bitcoin to double its current market cap.  When we do the math, $15bn is the kind of money that the Chinese or Saudi sovereign wealth can punt in their sleep… and I am pretty sure some will...  If you are an asset manager, yes, I am talking about flight to quality, clientele effect and search for yield, all rolled in one.  Now, who’d have thought one day the term 'flight to quality' will be used in the context of the same asset that people associated with drug dealing on the dark web a year ago? But then, the times, they are a changin’, and changin’ faster then ever.  It seems safe to say a bitcoin price of $2,000 or more is likely.  But in this uncertain world, it's hard to say what will happen in 2017. Here's my take on the blockchain scenarios we're likely to see.  1. Private blockchains will converge  Paying for plumbing is an out-of-body experience where I live in London, and you’re blessed if the plumbing gets done at all.  What does this have to do with blockchain?  It turns out Brian Behlendorf is bang on the mark when he says that most blockchain startups have had to spend too much time and money on plumbing and would prefer to get on with building business solutions instead.  This is exactly the path at least one reputed startup called Everledger has taken: use Hyperledger Fabric and spend their time tracking diamonds, bottles of wine and the like.  This trickle of common sense is soon to become a flood.  Lots and lots of other blockchain firms will start this migration from their own custom chain to everyone's plumbing chains. Around the end of Q1 2017, I expect Hyperledger Fabric 1.0 will finally arrive and private blockchains will start a rapid march toward enterprise readiness.  Then, around September 2017, R3's Corda will be production ready and give the Fabric stiff competition in the financial sector.  Soon afterwards, variants of ethereum like Quorum and Monax will start to mature and provide a highly resilient alternatives to Fabric and Corda.  In the meantime, hard-boiled crypto companies like Blockstream and Blockchain will launch their enterprise-friendly platforms built on top of the bitcoin blockchain knowledge base and the Grand Ascot race of blockchains will begin.  Other private permissioned blockchains will either be built for very specialized problems, such as Sawtooth Lake for IoT, or start to merge with one of the four major (bitcoin, ethereum, Hyperledger, Corda) ecosystems.  Remember, we've have seen this before with Linux and Apache Web server coming to quietly dominate the Web without much fanfare.  2. At least one supply chain blockchain will go live  It hasn't taken savvy technologists long to recognize that the first killer apps for private blockchains are to be found in making supply chains more efficient.  Let's face it, a technology upgrade of securities settlements or OTC clearing comes with $1tn dollar prize, but the guys who spend the money may not necessarily be the guys who take the spoils. Further, the volume of regulatory change required to enable settlements and clearing on a decentralized ledger architecture makes this a prospect only for the brave and the really well-funded.  Similarly, we have learned from the travails of Ripple that being the company that gets paid an altcoin for each cross-border payment would be awesome*, but you need to convince banks or cash-rich platform businesses to let yours be that company.  May the force be with Ripple.  Elsewhere, insurers have tens of billions to gain from blockchain-led efficiencies in the London insurance market alone, but it's not an industry that has ever been in a rush to drive such efficiencies, mainly because of a relatively profitable industry structure and significant coordination costs, at least until now.  Unlike within-industry consortia like R3 (that need to solve for the dynamics of 'coopetition'), supply chains are made of existing participants that have a natural incentive to collaborate and make the entire chain more efficient.  Many supply chains also have one dominant player such as Disney, Walmart or Toyota that can force network effects and reap the bulk of the gains from their investment.  These existing 'ecosystems' will start to adopt decentralized ledgers as a 'cross-enterprise-ERP' architecture first. Indeed, SAP and Oracle have a lot to gain... or lose, as IBM and Microsoft push the agenda on DLT.  Editor's note: A Ripple representative contested this perception of its business model, stating:    ""Ripple generates revenue by selling software and services to banks to help them dramatically improve their cross-border payment offerings and lower the costs of settlement.""    3. Privacy will be 'solved'  The big fuss in 2015 was scalability.  Almost every client I spoke to would say: ""But I heard bitcoin only does seven transactions per second"" and I'd say: ""But you are not building a decentralized currency for the public Internet, and by the way, have you heard about Tendermint?""  A year later, with lots of proofs-of-concept (PoCs) delivered, I don't get much trouble about scalability. Now, the ‘going concern’ is privacy.  With the general data protection regulation (GDPR) on the horizon and the wariness of banks about sharing anything, privacy is such a big deal that both Hyperledger Fabric and Corda have spent barrels of intellectual fuel either solving, or working around the problem.  In my opinion, privacy is a much harder problem to solve than scalability, but several approaches exist today that are appropriate depending on the business problem one is trying to solve.  Alex Batlin of BNY Mellon has done a terrific job of outlining these on his blog, and the situation will go from hot air to product by the force of demand and ingenuity in 2017.  4. Ethereum will get its act together  Watching ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and the crew in 2016 was like watching The Charge of the Light Brigade.  We started the year with the rallying cry of 'Code is Law' and ended the year with the whimper of 'Legally Enforceable Smart Contracts', thanks to a $100m experiment called The DAO that broke the faith of the millions of true believers that worshipped the immutable public blockchain.  A leading systems integrator immediately followed with chameleon hashes and editable blockchains, to which the response of the blockchain developer community was at best mixed.  Then followed a series of hard forks and the mutiny of ethereum classic, leading many nurturing parent types to launch backyard barbecues to provide governance and many critical parent types to launch into moralizing speeches about the need for discipline amongst children.  As a business advisor, I am platform neutral, but as a developer, I am closing my year with tremendous respect and optimism for ethereum.  Unlike bitcoin (which takes pride in its value, but has taken two years to see SegWit in production), and unlike the emerging field of half-baked blockchains, the people in charge of ethereum are not afraid to make bold fixes and evolve the platform quickly, even at their financial peril.  At this stage of maturity, this willingness to change and fix is the sign of a community that puts the dream before the money, and honestly, that's exactly how we got to the transistors, the mobile phone, the Internet and just about anything that has made our world a better place.  It’s always the dream, not the dollars.  I suspect that in 2017, ethereum will go live with its own version of proof-of-stake, fix several of the known bugs in EVM, probably clean up the mushroom forest of tools and implementations and make something that can be useful in the computer world rather than only on a world computer.  5. Blockchain tech will become boring  I hate to confess that I am an unexcitable 40-year-old survivor of the dotcom boom and the financial crisis.  All this while, I have seen people get really poor from booms and really rich from busts. It also works in the reverse. Not many thought leaders feel particularly excited about putting their head down and testing production code, and not many people working on real money spinners like to talk.  To an outsider, this hype curve phenomenon appears as the endless bipolar psychology of the nerds. ""I have seen this before… yawn"", is the refrain. My Zen eyes have seen the same too, just the other way round.  To an insider, boring is money. When people stopped talking about e-commerce, Amazon started growing like a rocket. When people stopped talking about search, online advertising became a multi-billion industry.  Now, big data is so yesterday and data lakes are starting to go live. After years of disappointment, AI has become Siri, Alexa, recommendation engines and maps.  For blockchain, 2017 is the year when dull ex-coders like me get to do real work, and the charming thought leaders move on to the next interesting thing. Those who are in the depth of blockchain today need to hang in with their teeth and let the excitement and the hot money wither away.  Wait, this happened with bitcoin in 2016 – bitcoin became the honey badger of money.  6. A central bank will put cash on a blockchain  James Carlyle of R3 said this best at the Hyperledger meetup in London this month and I paraphrase: you need two assets to make decentralized ledgers truly useful, the first is cash and the second is identity.  Talking about identity is like talking about religion, so let's talk about the secular notion of cash for now.  To use decentralized ledger tech in securities markets, you need true delivery versus payment (DVP). In order to do DVP, the cash leg must settle (ie arrive in the recipient’s account) without credit or market risk, which means you need a cash token backed by the governing central bank in the market you are operating in.  No matter how many macroeconomic simulations have been attempted, I think general purpose cryptocurrency on a blockchain is a promising (but risky) economic experiment and no central bank should launch one without a clear roadmap starting with a very limited purpose.  The logical place to start is a cash token similar to the utility settlement coin (USC) that banks can use to settle transactions ranging from securities trades and OTC derivatives to commercial mortgages and trade finance.  My prediction is at least one OECD central bank will pilot the idea before end of year 2017.  7. Identity arguments will continue  Despite this, it's likely we will still be stuck in arguments about whether identity belongs on a blockchain.  As a utilitarian simpleton, my starting point for digital identity is a mere token shared by a retailer and a bank with open APIs for the mundane purpose of selling things that a user doesn't need but wants anyway.  I believe we need to solve this simple problem before we can address self-sovereign legal identity for over 7 billion people in the world.The benefit of global, macro, near-impossible visions is that these visions make us attack the really hard problems that boring capitalists are too boring to pursue.  The verifiable claims project probably best represented by Evernym's Sovrin solution is an example of what self-sovereign identity for a global, public Internet of value needs to look like. Boring capitalists like me who are looking to solve the identity puzzle for the shameless material consumption of the masses can learn a lot from the vision espoused by Evernym.Yet, unlike cash on blockchain (which excites almost no one from liberal arts), identity on the blockchain makes humanists and philosophers scream in a fit of rage. The only group that benefits either way is the lawyers, and since lots of lawyers of all feathers will be involved in any discussion of identity on the blockchain, progress will be glacial.Come December 2017, we will have much better technology to deliver solutions for shared identity on the blockchain but not much progress in the real world.  8. Blockchain startups will perish like lemmings  Again, we have seen this whole wave with bitcoin already.  Three years ago, driven by FOMO and FUD, VCs of all sorts rolled into lots of startups that promised to 'disrupt banking with bitcoin'. This year, even the rather well-funded Circle has abandoned bitcoin without really abandoning it.  For much of this year, bitcoin has been a bad word, and everyone, (including people building bog standard RDBMS), claim to be working on blockchain (definitely not bitcoin).  All the excitement created by the theory of distributed ledgers has led anyone who's sold a company before to at least think about launching a bitcoin company.  As a result, a lot of me-too companies without a half-decent business idea or technical capability are now working on blockchain.  As the blockchain gold rush starts to calm down and the hype condenses into products, most of these investors will cut and run into the next hype – probably AI or IoT.  9. Blockchain conferences will lose money  This is my favorite prediction – even at the risk of becoming persona non grata at all the cool blockchain socials.  Leaving aside the top 20 conferences such as Money2020, Ethereum's DevCon, CoinDesk's Consensus and Construct, Eurofinance and Sibos, it's not always been clear what value all the panels that I have myself been on have contributed to the society or the blockchain community.  Alright, not all of us can build product and every emerging technology deserves a thriving ecosystem of media coverage, podcasts, panels and presentations to accelerate its progress.  That said, I really don't think I have seen this kind of mass panel overdose since Hotmail went live in 1996 and people discovered free email on the Internet.  In 2017, most business leaders will stop asking 'What is blockchain?', stop listening to sentences starting with THE blockchain, filter out the keywords, 'revolutionize', 'disrupt' and 'transform' and start asking how they can make money from this technology.  That is when blockchain will start making money and blockchain conferences will start losing it.

In total, the global exchange average was the highest observed since 5th December, 2013, when bitcoin traded at a high of nearly $1,150.  According to BPI data, the price remains just over $100 short of its all-time high of $1,165.89, reached on 30th November, 2013.  Notably, the uptick occurred during a time of heightened interest for the digital currency, which has drawn media attention from publications including BBC News, The New York Times and The Washington Post since passing the $1,000 threshold on 1st January.  Not all of the news of late has been positive, however, with the Financial Times going so far as to label bitcoin a ""pyramid scheme"".  Despite this lack of press confidence, however, analysts largely remain bullish on the price, which has appreciated roughly $100 over the last seven days, a movement that effectively puts it within striking distance of its all-time highs.  While bitcoin has been given a boost recently by macroeconomic factors, and its use in emerging markets, it remains to be seen if this rally will grow more speculative, and more volatile.  At press time, volumes and prices still appear to be driven by China-based trading, with prices trending $40 higher on CNY exchanges, according to BPI data.

The decision marks the latest validation for the privacy-oriented digital currency, which in 2016 found traction in appealing to users interested in transacting on dark markets or who otherwise desired, or believed there could be demand for, digital currencies with added privacy features.  The digital currency has to date been picked up by notable darknet marketplaces, with AlphaBay announcing in August of last year it would accept the cryptocurrency and darknet market Oasis Market following suit.  However, it could be said to have struggled courting the interest of major exchanges.  With the move, Kraken could be poised to reverse the trend, joining other major exchanges Bitfinex and Poloniex as one of the largest to accept the cryptocurrency.

""Monero is one of the leading cryptocurrencies that has seen huge 40x market cap growth in 2016 and trades with high volume and liquidity,"" Kraken stated on its blog. ""Monero is built on the core principles of privacy, decentralization, open development, scalability and fungibility.""
