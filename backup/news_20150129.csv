42398194,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSlhv,1422573014,USAA: Our Members Are 'Actively Engaged' in Bitcoin,"USAA's recent entrance into the bitcoin space may have been driven, in part, by interest in the technology among its own membership.  The Fortune 500 financial services company, based in Texas, was among a diverse group of investors that took part in Coinbase's $75 million Series C funding round, which was announced earlier this month. USAA, founded in 1922, focuses primarily on the US military and veteran market.  The financial group's head of corporate development, Vic Pascucci, said that USAA envisions digital currencies playing a possible role in future services, and cited internal data that points to interest in bitcoin among its customers.  Pascucci told CoinDesk:  “We see great future potential in bitcoin and digital currencies to allow us to better serve our members. We’re starting to see USAA members embrace bitcoin. Our research shows that USAA members are more actively engaged in bitcoin than the average consumer.”  USAA's statements suggest that the investment in Coinbase serves a dual purpose, to both position it in the alternative digital finance space, as well as the bitcoin market itself.  Interest in returns  Pascucci said that USAA took part in the funding round out of a desire to both explore new technologies as well as generate profitable returns.  At the same time, he pointed to Coinbase as a successful company within the growing bitcoin space, noting:  “USAA regularly looks for investments that achieve financial return that contributes to our financial strength, enhance the services we provide to our members or help address strategic business reasons.""  “[Coinbase is] the market leader in the bitcoin wallet space,” Pascucci added. “They have tremendous technology and management.”  The company left the door open to a potential application of bitcoin to its operational process, though it remains unclear how the financial group might utilize the protocol.  ""We see [bitcoin] as more of an enabler, with great future potential for us to better serve our members,"" he said.  Tanaya Macheel contributed reporting.

The announcements come amid a string of new details about the company’s business progress. Since raising $550,000 in November 2013, GoCoin has arguably become a big-three payment processor alongside BitPay and Coinbase due to its agnostic approach to digital currencies, accepting litecoin and dogecoin alongside bitcoin.

42398200,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSloo,1422560301,FTC Complaints Detail Troubled Past of Bankrupt Bitcoin Miner CoinTerra,"“I feel like I [was] cheated.”  The statement is just an excerpt from one of the 39 formal complaints filed with the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) against now-bankrupt bitcoin mining company CoinTerra and revealed in a new Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.  The 39 complaints are a far cry from nearly 300 complaints lodged against competitor Butterfly Labs before it was temporarily shut down by the FTC in September. However, the complaints paint a detailed picture of the frustrations long faced by CoinTerra customers.  The full complaints, which were received with personal information redacted, showcase the breadth of customer accusations that CoinTerra failed to meet advertised shipping dates, build hardware to the desired specifications or issue refunds in a timely manner.  One customer complaint reads:  “On 12/1/2013 I purchased a computing unit for a total of $6,288.35 (including all applicable taxes and shipping). The unit purchased had stated performance numbers. Once the units started shipping, they were not close to meeting the performance numbers promised.”  The customer goes on to state that Cointerra missed suggested refund times, before ceasing communications with the customer, in what was just one of many customer service frustrations detailed in the assembled remarks.  Others showcase the alarm many customers felt at the lack of response from the company.  “Just yesterday, 7th May, I had called the company more than 30 times, and after calling and calling, I finally was able to talk to someone, however, I got disconnected halfway,” another complaint reads.  Escalating issues  The complaints indicate that customer frustrations were heightened in April, when the company continued to delay refunds for TerraMiner IV products.  One filing illustrates the lack of faith among customers at the time that their concerns would be addressed by CoinTerra.  “After repeatedly asking when my funds would be returned, today (22nd April), Cointerra replied with this: ‘We are drawing near to your queue position for your refund, but before we process it I wanted to reach out to you regarding an offer,’ which clearly indicates that they have made no effort to return my funds,” the filing reads.  Pre-order refund updates related to the mining unit would continue through June. During this time, CoinDesk continued to receive complaints about the refund process from customers as well.  Responses suggest international customers also appealed to the FTC for assistance with refunds.  “It's a terrible shopping experience in US. I had believed American company will never do anything against law,” reads another complaint. “It seems I have made a mistake.”  Reimbursement unknown  Though customer complaints indicate many customers may still be owed funds from CoinTerra, it remains unclear when or if buyers will be reimbursed.  Statements from the company as recently as 8th October suggest 70% of customers had been reimbursed as of that time. However, some customers have reported failing to receive refunds as recently as 2nd January.  CoinTerra would later announce that it had defaulted on its secured notes and that payments made to customers would be suspended indefinitely.  CoinTerra filed for a Chapter 7 bankrupcty on 24th January, citing between $10m and $50m in liabilities and including a lengthy list of creditors that included commercial partners like data services provider CenturyLink, US bank Wells Fargo and C7 Data Centers, along with a wide range of private citizens and investors.  Still, CoinTerra CEO Ravi Iyengar has remained steadfast in statements that suggest he believes the company did its best to satisfy its customers, but that it was sometimes hindered by its own success.  “We were probably among the only few who delivered on time and in most cases ahead of time,” Iyengar told CoinDesk on 14th January. “We have no customers who wanted their hardware that didn’t receive it.”  Image via CoinTerra",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/29/ftc-complaints-detail-troubled-past-of-bankrupt-bitcoin-miner-cointerra,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a34affdad1d2d7e2e0b9ce7a1a40f1ba4b0f73db-2560x1860.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398196,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSlks,1422558996,Perkins Coie: The UCC and Bitcoins – Solution to Existing Fatal Flaw,"In this article, George K Fogg at law firm Perkins Coie examines why bitcoins might be subject to security interests that reduce their value for owners, and if this can be resolved.  Would you purchase a house if you had no information on its mortgages?  That’s comparable to what buyers of bitcoin do everyday: purchase bitcoin without any information about liens on their bitcoins.  A lien is an interest in a borrower’s property that serves as collateral to be used to pay off a lender, should the borrower default. If there are liens on bitcoins, the blockchain wouldn’t provide that information.  For now, it just indicates assurance of ownership.  Bitcoins are encumbered with security interests granted by one or more prior owners – this is the fatal flaw of the ecosystem. A securities intermediary – someone that would agree to treat bitcoins credited to a securities account as a financial asset – could be the solution.  The following report looks at the way this flaw leaves bitcoins potentially subject to security interests that would reduce their economic value to owners and how it can be resolved.  Today’s bitcoin ecosystem – The fatal flaw  Bitcoin provides transparency by having all transactions listed on a public ledger that allows one to trace the ownership of each bitcoin. This transparency – together with the irreversibility of each transfer of bitcoins – creates the assurance that the transferee is receiving ownership of the bitcoins being transferred. Unfortunately, the public ledger only identifies ownership. It provides no information on liens.  Article 9  security interests are created on personal property (known as collateral) by the owner granting the secured party a security interest. The secured party must take certain action to “perfect” its security interest in order to have the full benefit of the rights provided by Article 9.  Article 9 divides collateral into types, which are defined in the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC),[1] and provides different rules with respect to the different types. Under the current bitcoin ecosystem, bitcoins are “general intangibles” – the UCC’s catchall type.  A security interest in general intangibles is perfected only by filing a financing statement in the appropriate public office. The financing statement must describe the collateral, which description can be as vague as “all assets,” or as specific as the secured party decides to make it.  A security interest in general intangibles like bitcoin continues, notwithstanding the sale, license or other disposition of the collateral, unless the secured party consents to the transfer free of its security interest, the obligations secured by the security interest have been satisfied or the security interest has otherwise terminated.[2]  Thus, each time a bitcoin passes through the hands of an owner whose property is subject to a security interest in general intangibles that bitcoin becomes burdened with that security interest.  Security interests in general intangibles are very common, especially for a business with a bank secured line of credit. It is the combination of bitcoins being general intangibles, security interests in general intangibles not being automatically released upon transfer and the ubiquity of security interests in general intangibles that creates the fatal flaw – bitcoins that are encumbered with security interests granted by one or more prior owners.  UCC Article 8 – The Solution  The fatal flaw can be eliminated by changing the Article 9 collateral type of bitcoins from general intangibles to “investment property,” which is accomplished by using a structure that causes them to be Article 8 financial assets.  “Financial assets” are assets held by a “securities intermediary”[3] that maintains “securities accounts”[4] for others (“accountholders”) in the ordinary course of business, provided the intermediary agrees to treat the assets as financial assets under Article 8.  Thus, the bitcoin metamorphosis from general intangibles to investment property is accomplished by a securities intermediary agreeing to treat bitcoins credited to a securities account as a financial asset subject to Article 8.  The Article 8 structure has the following benefits:  A security interest in the accountholder’s account could be perfected by a control agreement (rather than a public filing), which maintains privacy  Bitcoins are no longer subject to liens granted in general intangibles  Bitcoins can be transferred free from existing security interests, provided the accountholder gave value for the bitcoins in the account without notice of existence security interests [5]  Bitcoins held in such accounts are not property of the intermediary and would not be subject to claims of the intermediary’s creditors [6]  Existing (but unknown) security interests are eliminated.  Perfection by control also gives the secured creditor superior control, which should make credit both more available and less expensive.  Since transfers of bitcoins are made by the intermediary on instructions of the accountholder, there is an additional layer of privacy for the accountholder  The intermediary has the obligation to maintain bitcoins in a quantity corresponding to the total of all bitcoins credited to such accounts [7]  This structure is well-known in commercial transactions, creates legal certainty, makes bitcoins held this way more attractive as collateral and will facilitate leveraging bitcoin investments with debt financing.  Summary  Under the current Bitcoin ecosystem, parties lack information regarding existing security interests. This circumstance leaves acquirers of bitcoins with the risk that their bitcoins may be subject to security interests that diminish or eliminate the economic value of the bitcoins to owners.  For bitcoins to become useful in significant commercial transactions, the present uncertainties regarding existing security interests must be removed. These uncertainties not only affect the ability of the acquirer to be certain it is receiving the value it bargained for, but also greatly diminishes the ability of the acquirer to finance such investments.  The Article 8 structure provides the solution for these deficiencies. It is a system that has worked well for securities and is flexible enough to do the same for bitcoins.      [1]  Collateral types under Article 9 (exclusive of sub-types) are: accounts, chattel paper, commercial tort claims, deposit accounts, documents, general intangibles, goods (which includes inventory, equipment, fixtures and consumer goods), instruments, investment property, letter-of-credit rights, letters of credit, money and oil, gas and other minerals before extraction.  [2]  UCC §9-315(a).  [3]  “Securities intermediary” is defined in UCC §8-102(a)(14). The prototypical securities intermediary is a trust company or a brokerage firm.  [4]  “Securities accounts” are a type of account defined in UCC §8-501(a).  [5]  UCC §8-502  [6]  UCC §8-503(a), UCC §8-507.

42398187,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSld0,1422548979,Research: Over $11 Million Lost in Bitcoin Scams Since 2011,"Scams promising bitcoin riches have netted swindlers at least $11m in the last four years, researchers have found.  Some 13,000 victims handed over their money unwittingly in 42 different scams over that time period, their data suggests.  However, the total amount of funds cheated from victims over this period is almost certainly higher than the estimated $11m the research identified.  A co-author of the research, Marie Vasek, said:  ""There are a lot of scams that we couldn't measure at all. There were scams we couldn't find or verify ... We think presenting our findings as they are, a lower bound, makes a lot of room for us and others to further quantify scams in this space.""  Vasek, who researches computer security at Southern Methodist University, co-wrote the paper with Tyler Moore, an assistant professor in computer science at the same institution.  Painstaking search  The paper, titled There's No Free Lunch, Even Using Bitcoin: Tracking the Popularity and Profits of Virtual Currency Scams, has been presented at the Financial Cryptography and Data Security conference taking place in Puerto Rico this week.  Vasek and Moore combed online repositories of scam accusations, including a mega-thread of scams, hacks and heists on the Bitcointalk forum that has been maintained since 2012, as well as the subreddit r/bitcoin, BadBitcoin.org and CryptoHYIPs.com.  This process required the researchers to painstakingly go through forum threads post by post, even translating messages that were written in languages other then English, as well as visiting the websites that scammers created to publicise themselves.  ""We went through every single post to determine if the scheme was a scam, any associated bitcoin addresses with the scheme, and any associated scams,"" Vasek said.  Using this method they found 349 scams, which were then whittled down to 192 deceptions after excluding phishing, malware and pay-for-click websites, which fall outside the scope of the study.  The researchers then extracted bitcoin addresses linked to the frauds, enabling them to look at transactions from victims to fraudsters recorded on the blockchain.  The paper groups scams into four categories: wallet software, exchanges, mining 'vapourware' and 'high-yield' investment programmes that operate as Ponzi schemes.  The authors notably exclude the collapsed bitcoin exchange Mt Gox from their study because it's unclear if the platform was originally set up to defraud users or was simply poorly run.  As Vasek put it:  ""Being bad at running a business does not make you a scammer, even if many people accuse you of that on the Internet.""  Catching the 'big fish'  The most lucrative scams were Ponzis, which yielded $7.3m to the fraudsters that the researchers were able to track. Mining scams were next, generating $2.9m in ill-gotten gains for the cryptocurrency hustlers. Exchange and wallet scams, by comparison, yielded a paltry $455,000 and $360,000 respectively.  The Ponzi schemes, which are called 'high-yield investment programs' (HYIPs) in the paper, come in three different flavours, ranging from 'traditional' programs to bitcoin-only variants. Moore has previously conducted research into HYIPs.  Notably, it is the schemes that cross over from the traditional HYIP world to the bitcoin realm that are the most successful, the paper finds. Nine scams bagged $6.5m-worth of coins in the 12 months from September 2013. These include schemes like Leancy, Cryptory and Rockwell Partners.  These 'bridge' HYIPs also keep the carousel going the longest, operating on average for 125 days before folding. Bitcoin-only schemes, like First Pirate Savings and Trust, by contrast run for only 37 days on average.  The analysis also produced insights into what makes a scam successful. The deceptions that generated the most money did so by getting a handful of ""big fish"" victims to pay in the majority of the funds.  ""For a scam to be successful, it appears that it must catch the few 'big fish' who will pay the bulk of the money into the scam,"" the authors write.  Vasek said the opportunity to use the blockchain to quantify the amount of money fraudsters were making was one reason she and Moore conducted their research.  ""The blockchain creates an opportunity in that transactions may often be tracked, which could make it easier to assess the true risk posed by scams,"" the authors write.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MINING | RESEARCH,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/29/research-over-11-million-lost-in-bitcoin-scams-since-2011,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2b7d9608065e610680fb2c21c374e3ca79e327b3-2547x1800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398201,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSlpn,1422540725,"The Winklevoss Brothers on Gemini, the 'NASDAQ of Bitcoin'","Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss aren’t shy about issuing bold predictions for Gemini, their recently revealed bitcoin exchange project.  Calling it the ""NASDAQ or Google of bitcoin"", the president and CEO, respectively, believe Gemini will be the fully regulated, fully compliant and fully banked institution the US bitcoin ecosystem needs to develop to its full potential.  In a new interview with CoinDesk, the brothers – prominent bitcoin investors and two of the largest-known holders of bitcoin – opened up about Gemini, discussing why they feel the exchange can become the market leader in what has been an increasingly active part of the bitcoin space.  While neither addressed competitors directly, both alluded to how their approach with Gemini stands in contrast to the other exchanges currently in the US market, even those that have recently dominated the headlines with claimed regulated offerings.  Cameron summed up this difference, stating:  ""We aren't interested in trying to find a way to be semi-operational, or operate around the fringe or hack our way in.""  Competitors aside, Cameron and Tyler focused much of the interview on evoking their long history as participants in the bitcoin space in comments that suggest that, to them, the fight to build a market-leading US exchange is personal.  “Without a doubt, we spent a great deal of time properly securing our own bitcoin,"" Tyler said. “We felt like we were uniquely positioned to speak to those issues and take the friction and the risk and all the things that we saw and convert them into a product and an experience that we thought would be unmatched.”  Tyler went on to suggest that Gemini was also the result of their failed efforts to find a team that would be able to handle the tall task of launching an exchange in what to date has been an uncertain jurisdiction for entrepreneurs.  ""We’re investors as well – we would have invested in a bitcoin exchange by now if we were confident they were covering all the bases,"" Tyler added.  'Best and brightest' team  As perhaps an extension of this passion, Cameron and Tyler took pains to express their belief that they have assembled the best possible team for the job.  Over the course of the interview, Cameron and Tyler rifled through the names of their employees’ former employers, mentioning the likes of sharing economy startup Airbnb, Google Wallet and tech giant Microsoft, among others.  The list of professionals now employed by Gemini includes Cem Paya, the former CSO of Airbnb and a former information security engineer at Google, and Michael Breu, a former head of security at investment management firm Bridgewater.  ""Our team members are individuals who have been in companies where there were lots of assets, and valuable information at stake,"" Cameron pointed out.  Gemini’s no-expense-spared approach to personnel is also apparent in its choice of partners.  For example, its regulatory lawyers hail from Katten Muchin Rosenman, while its anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) policies were crafted by specialists K2 Intelligence, a firm that helps banks comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and Patriot Act, while crafting policies for corporate governance and compliance.  Tyler said:  “We’ve worked very hard to understand what it would take to be a fully licensed, regulated entity in all the states, and we’re making sure we get this right. We’re not pretending we’re kids that don’t have to play by certain rules, I don’t think that’s the right way to approach it.""  All of this adds up to what the brothers suggested would be a complete product ready for market upon its debut.  “There’s regulation, compliance and then there’s security and product,"" Tyler noted. ""A lot of people just look at product and forget the other three. We consider all four of these issues as crucial to being a successful business.""  Front-door approach  Tyler suggested that Gemini’s proactive approach to regulation is another differentiating factor that positions it for success, as the project has actively courted the approval of regulators since its founding in February 2014.  “We felt like the only way to do this was to open up an active dialogue with the regulators, which we have done, and to establish a relationship with a US regulated bank, which we have done, and approach this with a security-first mentality from day one,” Tyler said.  While both are optimistic about launching the exchange in the first quarter of 2015, they were adamant that Gemini’s launch would be contingent on the passage of New York’s BitLicense proposal, which is expected to be finalized this month.  “We’re not launching until we’re licensed,"" Tyler remarked. ""Most people are taking a different approach, but we're not interested in operating without a license.""  Both brothers also lauded the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and its superintendent Ben Lawsky for their progressive approach to bitcoin regulation, calling the state the “clear choice” for their headquarters.  Gemini is currently in the process of securing licenses in all necessary US states, according to Tyler, and he anticipates the exchange will serve the entire nation at launch.  Security first  When discussing exchange security, Cameron and Tyler here too turned attention to the team behind Gemini, noting that these personnel were the first appointed.  ""When you talk to these security guys, usually they’re brought in when the train has already left the station, so it's refreshing to them that we're including them from the beginning,"" Tyler said.  He went on to frame this as different than existing exchanges, noting his belief that the exchange industry has already seen a few events he billed as “wake-up calls”.  While boastful about the security team behind the exchange, Cameron and Tyler were also open when discussing the specific security components that would be available at the exchange when it opens.  Planned features to be included in the Gemini exchange include multi-signature wallet support and two tiers of offline storage, dubbed 'cold' and 'cryo' for 'cryogenic' – both with different service-level agreements for access and withdrawal time.  The user-facing website will include two-factor authentication, and further internal-only sections of the site will use separate access controls that are not exposed to Internet.  Gemini will also mandate the coordinated actions of multiple employees to transfer any funds out of offline storage.  Flagship exchange  Both Cameron and Tyler stressed their belief that the lack of a leading bitcoin exchange in the US continues to set back the country’s bitcoin ecosystem.  ""To us it just seemed like an obvious hole in the infrastructure. If people can't easily and safely buy and sell bitcoin, it will be harder to build the application layer of native bitcoin apps and fuel the bitcoin economy in America,"" Cameron said.  Part of this approach entails being inclusive with the exchange by using design elements that appeal to individuals and institutions with a big-tent philosophy.  ""We are definitely targeting both individuals and institutions. Our offering will be suitable for anyone from individual hobbyist traders all the way to professional institutional traders. We are very much focused on servicing the investor crowd,"" Tyler explained.  The brothers expressed their belief that this balance, while difficult, is achievable provided they seek to differentiate from existing offerings.  ""If you look at terminal-like systems, they look overly technical and unfriendly, and they don't need to be that way in order to be powerful,"" he continued. ""We think we can achieve a clean, simple and friendly product that is also super powerful and robust.""  Passion project  Still, Cameron and Tyler further sought to make the case that they were the right leaders for the Gemini project given their experience and background.  Both stressed that Gemini has been their day-to-day project for the last year, and that other planned efforts to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) are unlikely to deter them from their work.  “Gemini is what we are and have been working on 100% of the time,” Tyler added.  Cameron went on to reiterate that the Gemini project, while set in motion last February, is the result of long-standing frustrations the brothers have had since the earliest days of the ecosystem.  “We didn’t start looking at this when Mt Gox collapsed, or when it stopped withdrawals,"" he continued. ""We started looking at this problem almost two years ago when Cyprus happened, when Mt Gox had a DDoS attack and was down for 12 hours.”  Past issues aside, both indicated that they are eager to move forward toward helping secure a brighter future for the bitcoin ecosystem.  Cameron concluded:  ""We're building the best product experience possible. If you want to think of this like how Google would approach bitcoin, so be it, Gemini is not going to be like anything else out there.”  Images via Gemini",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/29/the-winklevoss-brothers-on-gemini-the-nasdaq-of-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a6d89c6ce5903c3b890ff9b73edd007f8c4547e8-1267x605.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Previously users could only use programming language Python to execute trading strategies. However, the new product opens up the automated platform to bitcoin trading newcomers or those without programming ability.  James Potter, the platform's founder, said:  ""We looked at our collected experience over the past year, with our users coding thousands of Python-based strategies through the platform.

'Flattening the curve'  The new tool, called Scribe, works by taking trader's strategies and converting them into Python code ""on the fly"". Once a strategy is traded in live time, Tradewave hosts it on its servers and runs it for as long as it is required, placing trades on behalf of the user at their chosen exchange.  When asked about whether Scribe could run on the blockchain, Potter said the infrastructure ""simply is not mature enough yet"". He explained:  ""Each of the exchanges that we support has their own custom set of APIs and so integrating those in a uniform manner has been a challenge in itself.""  Potter said that a few companies had tried to come up with a solution to make automated trading more accessible to non-experts, but that most ""overwhelmingly tend towards creating a drag-and-drop interface representing something like a flow diagram, with endless switches and options"".  ""We are flattening the curve considerably"", said Potter, confirming that he also planned to focus on ""growing the site, as well as adding support for more exchanges and other useful features"".  Growing user base  According to the company, Tradewave received an undisclosed amount of ""angel-sized"" funding from the Digital Currency Group, which so far, is being used to ""expand the team, improve security and help with marketing costs"".  Potter said:  ""We are approaching 3,000 users at this point. We have seen 50% growth in traffic this month since we rolled out a new site design and revenue is up seven times from December. A lot of our technology could be equally well applied to forex, equities and other existing asset classes.""  The company offers several tiers of service, from a starter pack ($14 per month) with one trading bot, to a pro pack ($29 per month) with five bots, and a ""Gekko"" pack ($99 per month) with 15 concurrent bots.

The focus of the AMA was philanthropy and the work of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. As a result, Gates’ answer revolved around potential bitcoin applications in charity.  In response to the question ""What is your opinion on bitcoins or cryptocurrency as a whole? Also do you own any yourself?"", Gates wrote:  “Bitcoin is an exciting new technology. For our Foundation work we are doing digital currency to help the poor get banking services. We don't use bitcoin specifically for two reasons. One is that the poor shouldn't have a currency whose value goes up and down a lot compared to their local currency. Second is that if a mistake is made in who you pay then you need to be able to reverse it so anonymity wouldn't work.”  “Overall financial transactions will get cheaper using the work we do and bitcoin-related approaches,” he added. “Making sure that it doesn't help terrorists is a challenge for all new technology.”  Gates has discussed digital currency technology on a number of occasions and most recently he argued that bitcoin alone would not solve global payments challenges.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/29/why-the-gates-foundation-doesnt-use-bitcoin,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
42398170,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSjBU,1422523479,LocalBitcoins User Funds Stolen After Chat Client Hack,"Peer-to-peer bitcoin marketplace LocalBitcoins suffered a hack this week that resulted in the distribution of malware and a loss of customer funds.  Affected users will be granted refunds after taking steps to address security vulnerabilities, according to the company.  LocalBitcoins  vice president Nikolaus Kangas acknowledged the hackhttps://localbitcoins.com/forums/#!/general-discussion:localbitcoins-livechat-comp?ch=35qy on 27th January in a forum post, outlining how the intrusion took place through its LiveChat account, with an estimated 17 BTC lost from customer wallets.  The bitcoin marketplace has experienced security-related problems before, including an incident last year when a hacker gained access to its servers for a brief period of time, though according to LocalBitcoins no customer data was lost. Customers have also reported running afoul of fraudulent users in the past.  Kangas told CoinDesk that he believed the hackers used an unknown kind of malware that was able to bypass existing security measures, and took personal responsibility for the LiveChat intrusion.  He explained:  “The attacker used that LiveChat access to spread some kind of Windows executable, which probably was some new kind of keylogger software which is not yet detected by virus protection mechanisms. If the user got that executable installed, with some social engineering, the attacker managed to get access to different accounts of those victims.”  Customer postings on LocalBitcoins suggest that at least one user reportedly lost funds through other bitcoin-related accounts, but that user later reported that discussions with the company were underway on a possible solution.  Awareness prevented spread  According to the company, three users were identified as having lost funds during the hack. Reports indicate that a lack of two-factor authentication may have been to blame for the fraudulent withdrawals, and LocalBitcoins advised customers to ensure that they are using such security measures to protect their accounts.  Kangas said that thanks to the combined efforts of LocalBitcoins employees and users of the site, information about the LiveChat compromise was disseminated relatively quickly, noting:  “Due to fast actions by the Localbitcoins support staff and Localbitcoins.com community, the impact of the attack remained limited. The amount of users affected was fairly low due to general awareness of the users.”  Kangas added that the company is looking at how they can improve their internal security protocols to avoid similar incidents in the future, and suggested that the incident was illustrative of the costs and challenges of participating in a digital economy.  “This is not only a challenge to bitcoin users, but to all Internet services and users in general, about how to make those attacks equally expensive for those attackers,” he said.
