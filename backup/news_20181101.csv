42422918,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qzRh,1541109632,"Binance Signs Up 40,000 Crypto Traders in Its First Week in Uganda","Despite global market doldrums, demand for cryptocurrency appears to be booming across Uganda, a country where nearly three out of four people don't have bank accounts.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Binance Uganda signed up 40,000 users in the first week since the world's largest crypto exchange launched its local subsidiary in October.  The early results suggest a strong appetite among unbanked Ugandans for purchasing bitcoin or ether, the two coins the new Binance unit currently lists.  According to a paper by Stanford University researchers recently published in the American Economic Journal, 74 percent of Ugandan households are unbanked. As such, Binance's chief financial officer Wei Zhou told CoinDesk:  ""They [users] just have to have money within the mobile payment system. They don't have to have bank accounts.""  Aside from the local focus, the effort differs from Binance's flagship global trading platform in at least two other notable ways.  While Binance only offers trading of cryptos for other cryptos, its new unit in Uganda is partnering with a local mobile payments provider that will convert fiat to crypto or vice versa. (The partner asked not to be named, due to safety concerns related to managing large quantities of cash.) Unlike its Malta-based parent company, a spokesperson told CoinDesk that Binance Uganda plans to eventually open local bank accounts.  ""One of the major issues in the region, in the continent, right now is liquidity and Binance will bring us liquidity,"" Nairobi-based entrepreneur Marvin Coleby in nearby Kenya, co-trustee of the African Digital Asset Framework, told CoinDesk. ""These digital assets can move, borderless, around the continent.""  Further, the prospective Ugandan users are still undergoing the know-your-customer (KYC) onboarding process, verifying their government-issued IDs. Binance was historically known for only requiring an email address to trade crypto-to-crypto.  Previously, Ugandans who wanted to trade crypto were mostly reliant on peer-to-peer exchanges like LocalBitcoins or nearby services such as the Zimbabwean exchange Golix. However, Kwame Rugunda, chairman of the Uganda Blockchain Association and co-founder of the Ugandan blockchain startup CryptoSavannah, told CoinDesk such platforms hardly represent a ""large population in the country that are unbanked"" and ""hungry"" for access to cryptocurrency.  Since Binance Uganda opened, Rugunda said, several other global exchanges have started contacting local regulators.  ""We've already heard of interest from other players that are looking at the Ugandan market,"" he said.  Meanwhile, Zhou told CoinDesk that Binance Uganda is looking to hire local operational staff for both local support and expansion of similar subsidiaries in 2019 to either Kenya, Nigeria, or South Africa.  ""Uganda is our pivot to reach out to other African markets,"" Zhou said.  Driving factors  Remittance is a crucial factor driving demand for bitcoin in Uganda, Rugunda said.  A 2014 national census revealed nearly 10 percent of Ugandan households received remittance from neighboring Kenya, only a few percentage points below the most popular remittance sources in Europe, Sweden and Germany. But these transfers carry high conversion fees, creating demand for alternatives.  ""There's a lot of cost in the financial system when you switch the currencies back and forth, in addition to inflation,"" Zhou said, adding:  ""That tells us that a use case for cryptocurrency in Africa is as a hedge against inflation.""  Other factors driving cryptocurrency adoption in Uganda are rampant unemployment beyond the agricultural industry and demand for imported products, Rugunda said.  ""There's a large consumer market for people purchasing cars, for example, because bitcoin is legal tender in Japan,"" where the cars are manufactured, Rugunda said.  Meanwhile, the International Labour Office estimated in 2017 that almost 15 percent of working-age Ugandans under 30 were unemployed, plus nearly 49 percent who were employed only had irregular or temporary work. As such, many are becoming self-employed.  ""Unemployment is another real factor,"" Rugunda added. ""It forces people to look outside of formal employment structures.""  This harkens to similar factors noted by cryptocurrency advocates in the Palestinian territories, where educated young people look online for opportunities to earn, shop with, and trade crypto when white-collar jobs are scarce.  On the other hand, there's still a long way to go until those 40,000 Binance Uganda users start to rely on bitcoin for daily remittances.  BitPesa CEO Elizabeth Rossiello, based in nearby Kenya, told CoinDesk that many Ugandans became skeptical of bitcoin after criminal operations promised Ugandans bitcoin then defrauded them instead.  ""Uganda is a heavily offline market, where trust is built through face-to-face interactions,"" Rossiello said. ""We are very hopeful in regards to regulation and government support, as they have been recently very open to new blockchain events and innovations.""  In his dealings with local authorities, Rugunda said he's seen an increasing openness to the cryptocurrency industry, including the establishment of a National Taskforce for Blockchain. In fact, Ugandan royal Prince Kudra Kalema is currently spearheading an energy project with the crypto startup Wala, which already has thousands of Ugandan mobile app users.  Zhou agreed Uganda is ""an up-and-coming African country"" with a relatively crypto-friendly and stable political system. Speaking to the high demand for fiat liquidity and affordable cross-border crypto transactions, he concluded:  ""For Africa as a whole, this is just step one for Binance to serve Africa.""

42429918,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM27Dh,1541105143,'Ruff' Month? Dogecoin's Price Slid 36 Percent in October,"Market data shows that the meme-themed dogecoin was the worst-performing coin out of the world's largest 25 cryptocurrencies by capitalization for the month of October.  The cryptocurrency – derided as a joke by some, beloved by others – first hit the market in 2014 and has since been through a series of boom-and-bust cycles ever since in terms of overall market performance.  The cryptocurrency's most recent price boom began at the end of August and extended into early September, when its price surged over 160 percent to reach a six-month high of $0.0068 on September 10th, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Those fortunes reversed in October, resulting in a 36 percent monthly loss that brought the coin's price more than 50 percent below that September high-water mark.  And as can be seen in the chart below, these cyclical price movements are nothing new to DOGE.  According to data from Coinmetrics.io, DOGE often provides a 30-day return in excess of 100 percent as depicted by the thin orange line. DOGE's price vs. BTC is comprised of the orange area in the background, which further shows the cyclical nature of its price action.  In fact, 2015 was the only year to not include a 30-day return above 100 percent, although it did come close with a 94 percent return in a 30-day span.  What's more, the 30-day percent returns have exceeded 300 percent on multiple occasions since 2014.  As can be seen, the booms are often followed by busts when the monthly returns hover just above or significantly below zero. This metric entered negative territory on October 10th and has yet to return to a positive value.  Indeed, it was a poor month for DOGE in terms of percent change, but with 22 of the top 25 world's largest cryptocurrencies reporting losses over the course of October, DOGE's performance wasn't unique.  Monthly performance  Monthly performance: -36 percent  All-time high: $0.017  Closing price on October 31: $0.003764  Rank as per market capitalization: 23  DOGE was in a slow but steady decline since the month began at a price of $0.0058, until it concluded at a 36 percent lower price of $0.003764.  From open to close, October was DOGE's worst-performing month since last March, when it fell 52 percent.  In terms of monthly trading volume, October's $403 billion was just 30 percent of the prior month's volume of $1.2 billion and its lowest since July, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Daily Chart  On August 31, DOGE's price broke bullish out of a falling wedge (bullish reversal pattern) which set the stage for its latest ""boom"" cycle.  As with all of DOGE's boom cycles, though, it eventually topped out on Sept. 10 at the price of $0.007, according to data from Poloniex, and the price began its descent thereafter.  Using the Fibonacci retracement tool by connecting the low of $0.0023 on Aug. 14 to its $0.007 peak, it can be seen that price is hovering near the golden ratio of 0.618 retracement, which may offer support for a temporary up move. That said, the price has found acceptance below the 200-day EMA, so a sustained rally will not come easily.  Coincidentally, the 0.618 Fibonacci is located at the same price level as the high of DOGE's previous bull cycles, $0.0041. Resistance tends to flip to support once it's broken, which bodes well for the immediate price action of DOGE.  What's more, the relative strength index (RSI) is approaching oversold territory, meaning sellers could lose strength in the near-term. The moving average convergence and divergence indicator (MACD) is echoing similar sentiments and the short-term bullish case would strengthen if the indicators produce a bullish crossover in the next few days.  It should be noted that DOGE tends to retrace significantly after a strong incline, sometimes beyond 100 percent, so history would suggest that it's unlikely that the price holds its current level for too long.  If the daily Guppy Multiple Moving Average indicator (GMMA) flips red, it will likely confirm there is more downside action ahead for DOGE, in which case the next Fibonacci retracement of 0.786 near the price level $0.0030 could be looked to for support.

42429902,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM26ph,1541097030,Sia Completes Hard Fork as Bricked Miners Form Rival Blockchain,"The distributed cloud storage blockchain network Sia has successfully completed a planned hard fork, changing its consensus rules in a way that prevents some specialized hardware from mining on the network.  ""All is working normally now,"" David Vorick, co-founder and CEO of Nebulous, the for-profit company behind the Sia network, told CoinDesk on Thursday.  The fork, planned for the previous day, was set to take place at block 179,000 in the Sia chain, but miners found themselves stuck at block 178,999 for hours because, as Vorick wrote in a community forum Wednesday evening, an error in the code meant that miners ""will need to mine at least one block at full difficulty before the adjustment kicks in. This may take anywhere from 6 to 48 hours.""  The block was found shortly before 6:00 a.m. ET. Following that block, the difficulty – a parameter that blockchains use to ensure that blocks are mined at fairly regular time intervals, whatever the total computing power of the network – dropped by around 98 percent, allowing miners to resume finding blocks every 10 minutes on average.  Following the fork, though, the Sia network had far fewer miners.  The purpose of the change to Sia's consensus rules was to ""brick"" or disable specialized mining hardware manufactured by Bitmain and especially Innosilicon. And in that respect, Vorick said, ""the hardfork trick worked.""  As a result, there is only one type of mining equipment able to crunch through Sia's new hash algorithm fast enough to compete – and these are manufactured by Obelisk, a subsidiary of Nebulous.  Obelisk was unveiled in June 2017 as a chip manufacturer to challenge Bitmain – the dominant player in the market for cryptocurrency application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), as specialized mining equipment is known. Obelisk announced that its first product would be an ASIC for Sia, but within months it had become clear that Bitmain had beaten Obelisk to market and was using its Sia ASICs to mine on the network in secret.  In January, Bitmain went public with its product, and in April another manufacturer, Innosilicon, came out with an even faster Sia ASIC. Obelisk had still not shipped its ASICs, and its June 30 deadline for doing so came and went. Threats of legal action followed. The first Obelisk ASICs shipped in August, with the last going out in mid-October.  Nebulous had a trick up its sleeve, however: a kill switch that would enable the company to change the Sia algorithm in a way that would disable other miners, but let Obelisk miners keep running. After nearly a year of debate, Nebulous announced at the beginning of October that it would flip that kill switch and fork the network.  Vorick told CoinDesk Thursday:  ""The reason we had the secret circuit was to activate it in the event of a malicious mining attack. While there was not ever a direct attack on the consensus system, much of the community felt that the secret development of ASICs was an attack, and also felt that one farm owning 45 percent of the hash rate was risky, and justified forcing a [proof of work] change.""  SiaClassic  Not everyone was happy with the decision to fork – in particular those who had invested in Innosilicon hardware. While Vorick characterized community support for the move as over 90 percent, some have characterized it as a ""protectionist"" bailout for the company he leads.  As has happened with other controversial hard forks – most notably ethereum's following the DAO theft – part of the community has decided to continue using the old Sia protocol. SiaClassic, as this group calls itself (in a conscious nod to Ethereum Classic), has set up a separate foundation and separate social media forums.  The group has also published a ""Declaration of Independence."" SiaClassic miners kept finding blocks without interruption, even as the ""main,"" Nebulous-endorsed chain stalled briefly.  SiaClassic ""has very low community support,"" Vorick said. ""They say they believe in the vision though, and that they wish to have a collaborative relationship with the main chain. If SiaClassic does get support, then we are happy to engage them collaboratively. But so far we've seen little evidence of actual support outside of SiaClassic employees.""  The SiaClassic Foundation said in a statement to CoinDesk, ""We greatly respect Siacoin's founding principles, and the people who have supported them since the very beginning. We are focused on the future. We are excited about the team we've built, and we look forward to working with the SiaClassic community to take this project to the next level.""  At least two other non-Nebulous groups have also emerged: Sia Prime, which Vorick said was ""also collaborative with Nebulous,"" leaving the mechanism that funds Nebulous in the code in what he called ""a big sign of good faith.""  Finally, Hyperspace is ""an adversarial fork that wishes to replace Nebulous,"" Vorick said, although they ""have not written any storage platform code themselves.""  Mark Huetsch, project lead at Hyperspace, responded, ""We are not looking to replace Nebulous. We've made a number of innovations on the codebase including scriptless atomic swaps using Schnorr signatures as well as SPV node support. We encourage Nebulous to merge these enhancements into Sia but, particularly with respect to SPV node support, they have seemed uninclined to do so.  Vorick characterized the fork as a success for the Sia community. ""The hashrate is much much more decentralized than before the fork,"" he said, estimating that 87 percent of the network's computing power was accounted for by ""community members.""  While it may be too early to tell, however, it seems that there may no longer be just one Sia community.

42429901,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM26lh,1541093436,Another Stablecoin Just Launched With 'Real-Time' View of Dollar Backing,"Yet another stablecoin has just launched – this time from a blockchain startup founded with the explicit aim of taking on the controversial but dominant tether (USDT) token.  Stably announced Thursday that its StableUSD (USDS) is now available for purchase and redemption. The token is backed by U.S. dollars held in escrow by Prime Trust, a regulated trust company in Nevada that has carved out a niche playing this supporting role in a number of stablecoin projects.  Perhaps most notably, Stably claimed in a blog post it would be transparent about its fiat holdings, saying:  ""Stably recognizes that a fiat-backed stablecoin requires a high standard of public transparency for consumers and businesses to build trust ... Users of Stably's future platform will be able to view our fiat reserve's balance in real-time via a live feed from Prime Trust's API.""  Accounting firm Cohen & Co. will also ""conduct weekly attestations for our fiat reserve,"" the post continued.  The launch comes as the market's leading stablecoin, USDT, has come under fire due to concerns that it is not fully backed by fiat. The company behind it, Tether Ltd., has long maintained that USDT is collateralized 1-for-1 but has been unable to get an audit to put the doubts to rest. The token lost its market parity with the dollar last month, falling nearly 15 cents on at least one exchange, though it has since recovered.  On Thursday, Tether produced a letter that appeared to be from Deltec Bank and Trust Limited, confirming that the bank was holding roughly $1.8 billion for the company. It is unclear whether this balance has changed recently to match Tether's withdrawal of nearly 1 billion USDT tokens from circulation over the past few weeks, and no name was attached to the letter.  Stablecoins like USDS and USDT allow investors to more quickly trade cryptocurrencies by bypassing any delays caused by transferring funds via banks to exchanges. Other recent entrants to this space include the Winklevoss twins' Gemini dollar (GUSD), TrustToken's TrueUSD (TUSD), the CENTRE Consortium's USD//Coin (USDC) and the Paxos Standard (PAX), among others.  'Proven centralized model'  Prospective users can apply to Stably's early-access program but must complete a know-your-customer process (KYC) to begin generating or redeeming USDS.  The tokens are generated through the use of smart contracts, according to the company's announcement. Verified users can transfer funds to the trustee, at which point Stably will send the transaction to its smart contract. The platform will then mint new USDS tokens, which are sent to the user.  ""StableUSD will utilize a proven centralized model to fully back every token issued,"" the announcement stated.  Registered users can already conduct this process, though Stably intends to release a web portal to simplify the process.  ""The creation process will also work with bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), or tether (USDT),"" the post added. ""The sent cryptocurrency will be converted to U.S. dollars on the open market by our regulated third-party trustee. The corresponding amount of StableUSD will then be minted and sent back to the client through our smart contract.""  Stably has been working to develop USDS for the better part of the year. In April, the startup raised $500,000 in seed funding, with co-founder Kory Hong writing at the time that ""the blockchain economy desperately needs a reliable and price-stable medium of exchange as well as a store of value in order to evolve and scale beyond its current speculative state.""  Hong also specifically mentioned USDT in that post as the incumbent Stably would challenge. ""Tether's first-mover advantage has paid off handsomely, but their dominance probably won't last forever as more stablecoins start coming onto the scene,"" he wrote.  Editor's note: This article has been updated to reflect that while Circle initially issued USDC, the CENTRE Consortium, co-founded by Circle and Coinbase, is now the issuing company.

The company, which issues the controversial tether (USDT) stablecoin, has long been under fire over concerns that it does not have the fiat holdings to fully back the tokens in circulation. It had been rumored for weeks to be working with Deltec but did not previously acknowledge the relationship.  ""The acceptance of Tether Limited as a client of Deltec came after their due diligence review of our company,"" the issuer said in a blog post, adding:  ""This included, notably, an analysis of our compliance processes, policies and procedures; a full background check of the shareholders, ultimate beneficiaries and officers of our company; and assessments of our ability to maintain the USD-peg at any moment and our treasury management policies.""  To show proof of its bank balance, Tether released a letter dated November 1 that appeared to come from Deltec, confirming ""the portfolio cash value of your account with our bank was US$1,831,322,828"" as of October 31.  Yet there is no person's name attached to the letter, and the signature is a simple cubic curve. Further, the letter contained two notable caveats: it was provided ""without liability, however arising, on the part of"" the bank, its shareholders, directors, employees or officers; and the letter is ""solely based on the information currently in our possession.""  Deltec will continue to review Tether ""on an ongoing basis,"" the latter company said.  The bank previously declined to confirm any relationship with Tether when reached. In an email dated October 18, a representative told CoinDesk that ""Due to governing legislation and our own privacy policies, we cannot comment on whether any entity is or is not a client of the Bank.""  The representative added: ""However, we can state that Deltec conducts all client relationships in a manner that is fully compliant with all applicable banking regulations, and consistent with our internal policies with respect to safety and sound risk management.""  Deltec and Tether could not be immediately reached for comment Thursday.  Still no audit  The bank letter is the latest attempt by Tether to reassure the market about its reserves without an audit, which the company has said is not obtainable. Like the Deltec letter, those previous third-party assurances came with qualifications.  Tether previously tasked a law firm to check on its bank balance. In June, the firm – Freeh Sporkin & Sullivan, LLP – said it was ""confident"" that Tether had more funds in its account than there were tokens in circulation on a single day, June 1.  However, the law firm said in its report that the work it did was ""not for the purpose of providing assurance.""  Earlier, a preliminary report by audit firm Friedman LLP issued in September 2017 indicated that the company had at least $440 million and €1,590 in various bank accounts, fully backing the tokens then in circulation.  But the names of the banks were redacted, and Friedman never did a full audit; Tether parted ways with the firm in January.  Tether has notably been removing USDT tokens from circulation over the past month after the stablecoin lost its parity with the dollar.  Some 930 million USDT tokens, which in theory represent $930 million, have been taken out of circulation since October 14.  As of Wednesday, there were under 1.8 billion tokens remaining in circulation, and USDT was trading at $0.998579, according to CoinMarketCap.  David Floyd contributed reporting.

42429909,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM26zh,1541084349,New York Awards First-Ever BitLicense to Bitcoin ATM Company,"Bitcoin teller machine (BTM) operator Coinsource has just become the 12th crypto company to receive a license from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).  The firm announced approval of the so-called BitLicense on Thursday, with the firm's general counsel Arnold Spencer noting that it was the first granted to a bitcoin ATM provider to date. The company already has 40 BTMs in the state, having been operating under a provisional license pending full approval.  In a statement, NYDFS superintendent Maria Vullo confirmed the news, saying the license approval is ""a further step in implementing strong regulatory safeguards and effective risk-based controls while encouraging the responsible growth of financial innovation.""  Receiving the BitLicense, Spencer told CoinDesk, ""is a validation of our business model [and] our compliance model.""  He explained:  ""It's been a long, involved process. The initial application was [in 2015, and] since then what we've seen is a great deal of diligence on NYDFS' part, really pushing us to both explain and in some cases improve our policies and procedures.""  These ranged from having a business disaster continuity plan to state-of-the-art cybersecurity measures, Spencer indicated. During the evaluation period, Coinsource grew from being an unaudited firm with three employees and a handful of BTMs to being fully audited and growing to more than 20 employees and over 200 machines.  ""We've had 500 percent growth over three consecutive years in terms of machines, and we've had comparable growth in revenue until spring of 2018, when it slowed down substantially,"" he said.  Compared with traditional exchanges, the firm's BTMs are convenient and offer direct peer-to-peer transactions, Spencer said, adding: ""We do our account opening and compliance in real-time.""  The machines' speed comes from a proprietary system that Coinsource developed to conduct know-your-customer checks. Where a customer would have to send a crypto exchange bank details and other proof of identification, Coinsource only needs a driver's license, a selfie and a cellphone number.  Coinsource also makes it easier for unbanked individuals to access cryptocurrencies, Spencer said, as they do not need to possess a bank account to purchase bitcoin and can pay with cash.  Going forward  At present, Coinsource customers can only buy or sell bitcoin through the BTMs – they can't actually send funds to other wallets yet.  Spencer explained that this is by design, as allowing that would be facilitating money transmission, so ""you have to have a money transmission license in both jurisdictions – where you're starting the transaction and where you're ending the transaction.  However, the company currently has money transmission licenses in 18 states, with pending licenses in another 15. Spencer anticipates that by sometime next year, Coinsource will have be licensed in all 50 states.  ""At that point in time, we'd be in a position to have people deposit cash into machines and transfer bitcoin into a third-party wallet, provided both customers were registered,"" he said.  Outside of the U.S., Coinsource plans to expand operations potentially to Japan, South Africa and Puerto Rico.  Of these, Puerto Rico is likely to happen first, with the company already having a money transmitting license for the territory.  ""We have had preliminary discussions with regulators in Japan to use that as a springboard for Asia, and we've had initial conversations with bankers and regulators in South Africa, but that's probably the furthest out in terms of development,"" Spencer said.  Further, being incorporated in Argentina, Coinsource already has a base for Latin and South American expansion.  The addition of cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin across all the firm's machines is also on the cards in the ""near future,"" but ""that's contingent, of course, on regulatory approval,"" he said.

42429911,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM275h,1541077171,Cute Cats Power Serious $15 Million Funding for CryptoKitties Creators,"The company behind the viral blockchain phenomenon CryptoKitties is planning to enhance its platform – and it's received backing from some major tech firms to do it.  Announced Wednesday, Dapper Labs, the startup that spun out of parent firm Axiom Zen to continue working on CryptoKitties, has secured $15 million in funding. The round was led by Venrock and was joined by Google Ventures, SamsungNEXT and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), as well as names not normally associated with venture investing, such as the talent agency William Morris Endeavor and e-sports firm aXiomatic.  The new funding comes months after Dapper Labs secured $12 million in a round led by a16z and Union Square Ventures.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Venrock partner David Pakman struck a bullish tone on what he sees as a massive collectibles market being created in the digital world.  ""For the first time we can make scarce digital items, and I think that can usher in a mega-market of digital collectibles,"" Packman argued.  While Venrock is not known as a blockchain or crypto-focused investment company, Pakman sees CryptoKitties as a specific case wherein blockchain can allow people to do something online that so far they have only done offline: collect rare (or scarce) things.  ""I look for activities that consumers are already doing in very large numbers and then look for the digital equivalent,"" he explained.  No stranger to digital intellectual property, prior to Venrock, Pakman led eMusic, a pioneering company in digital music sales. Dieter Shirley – Dapper's chief technical officer and the author of the ERC-721 token standard on which the crypto collectable economy operates – said that his startup was especially happy to work with Pakman as it needed guidance as it looks to grow from a small startup team to a much larger company.  With $27 million in new funding so far this year, all signs point to Dapper Labs being on the cusp of a new release.  Shirley declined to give any details about what's to come, but he did say something should come in the next weeks – not months. To that end, the company has put up a teaser page on its website, and one of their engineers shared it in the stream of tweets surrounding Devcon, the ethereum developers conference taking place in Prague right now.  With a possible eye to the future, Shirley said that originally run CryptoKitties would no longer be regularly released at the end of November.  Indeed, he indicated that the company is looking to leverage its latest funding round to build interesting new experiences for users of decentralized apps.  Shirley told CoinDesk:  ""Ultimately, our mission here is to bring a billion people to the blockchain. We think blockchain has real value for consumers but we're never going to get them to see that value by explaining it.""  Games are coming  CryptoKitties is itself a game, but it's a low-intensity one wherein collectors can create new characters from the CryptoKitties they already possess.  It's not difficult to read the tea leaves around the company's recent news to see that something more energetic is coming, something a lot more like a traditional gaming experience.  ""We have a lot more experiences and plans for CryptoKitties and their users,"" Shirley said.  Among the other indications that games will form a bigger part of their plans going forward: new hires from companies like Ubisoft, Zynga and EA Sports – all major firms that have built huge followings around their interactive properties.  One of the advantages of creating a decentralized system is that other teams can start building on top without asking for permission.  Shirley pointed to some of these examples as proof of the success of the game. Take for instance, the site that lets users dress up their cats, KittyHats. And this past summer, the CryptoKitties team updated its licenses to clarify the rights held by owners of particular cats.  That said, CryptoKitties wants to participate in building these new experiences.  ""The sky's the limit. CryptoKitties are characters,"" Shirley said.  Building out  Dapper Labs' new funding will also support the creation of a U.S. subsidiary for the Canadian company.  On top of that, Shirley spoke broadly of opportunities with brands in an effort to open up additional avenues for business.  ""There's tons of IP brands that would love to issue digital collectibles,"" Pakman said.  Companies that have already done really well in physical collectibles, he said, have been waiting for a way to do it right online.  ""The evolution of true digital ownership and the interoperability of smart contracts creates new ways for consumers, creators and platform providers to interact completely peer-to-peer, with no middlemen,"" explained Dapper Labs' CEO Roham Gharegozlou in a statement.  Shirley said that the work Dapper would do with a brand would vary a lot, depending on the partner. He gave the example of the National Basketball Association – in that case, the basketball league would probably look to Dapper to build most of the experience.  On the other hand, if it worked with a gaming giant like Ubisoft, Dapper might be called on to build a much more narrow part of the overall specification.  Regardless, Shirley believes more and more opportunities will arise as the younger generations get older and experience more of their upbringing online.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The generation growing up now is the first one that has more relationships through digital means rather than physical means.""

42429915,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM279h,1541071295,Bitcoin Price May Break Three-Month Losing Streak in November,"Bitcoin ended October on a weak note, confirming its first three-month losing streak since 2015, but things may be looking up for November.  The leading cryptocurrency closed yesterday at $6,320 – down 4.32 percent from the Oct. 1 opening price of $6,606, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Over August and September, prices had dropped 9.22 percent and 5.8 percent, respectively.  The last time BTC suffered losses for three consecutive months was in the first half of 2015. Back then, BTC was averaging $250 and prices dropped 4 percent, 2.8 percent and 2.7 percent in March, April and May, respectively.  As seen in the chart above, however, October's 4 percent drop is the lowest in three months. Furthermore, BTC rallied 14 percent in June 2015 after posting losses in the previous three months.  So, it's possible bitcoin will repeat that pattern and snap its three-month losing streak in November, according to seasonality analysis and technical studies.  The historical data shows that BTC has always reported gains in November, except in 2011, when it dropped 8.6 percent.  It's also worth noting that BTC's best-ever monthly performance was a 467 percent price rise seen in November 2013.  Sellers may have run dry  BTC has defended the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA) for the fifth month running, signaling that a bottom could be in place close to $6,000.  That argument is bolstered if we take into account the fact that the cryptocurrency avoided a bearish monthly close yesterday, despite a negative crossover between the 5- and 10-month EMAs.  The outlook as per the monthly chart remains neutral as long as prices are trapped between the September high of $7,402 and the 21-day EMA of $6,130.  It is worth noting that the longer the narrow trading range persists, the lower price volatility will go. A number of volatility measures have already hit yearly lows in the last two months. Notably, daily price volatility remained below $100 for seven consecutive days last month – the longest at such levels since April 2017.  View  Bitcoin may see a rise in November if seasonal patterns repeat.  The long-term technical charts indicate bearish exhaustion and a bottom was likely reached around $6,000.  A bullish reversal would be confirmed only if BTC invalidates the series of lower highs with a move above the September high of $7,400.

42429900,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM26hh,1541066411,Coinbase's Emilie Choi: $300 Million Raise Was 'For a Rainy Day',"With its latest funding round, Coinbase, the cryptocurrency exchange turned Silicon Valley unicorn, is amassing a ""war chest"" for a ""rainy day.""  At least, that's how Coinbase's vice president of corporate and business development, Emilie Choi, described the $300 million the company recently raised in a Series E round with investors such as Tiger Global Management and Polychain, the latter of which is headed by former Coinbase employee Olaf Carlson-Wee.  ""It was opportunistic,"" Choi told CoinDesk Wednesday. ""We didn't need to raise it.""  Speaking to why a company reportedly generating $1.3 billion in annual revenue would continue to court venture capitalists, she added:  ""We want to have money for a rainy day, to be able to act on any opportunities that we think are going to be really important.""  Namely, the leading opportunity that Choi sees is adding support for new assets across Coinbase platforms, eventually ""thousands"" of prospective cryptos.  Beyond the Circle-issued stablecoin that Coinbase already supports, USDC, other fiat-pegged assets may also be under consideration.  ""With adding assets, stablecoins are a natural extension of that,"" Choi said. ""As we move towards this utility phase of crypto, we recognize that one of the big things holding users back from actually using crypto was the volatility of it. So a stablecoin helps pave the way for crypto to be more usable and more stable.""  She added that diverse categories, such as stablecoins or privacy coins, will naturally emerge as Coinbase adds support for more assets. The company is already considering the privacy-centric asset zcash.  When asked if Coinbase might someday list initial coin offerings (ICOs), tokens launched to fundraise for blockchain projects, Choi replied the company didn't want to ""close the door"" to any opportunity down the road.  ""All the priorities right now are focused on adding assets, adding international rails, all that kind of stuff."" she said.  Crypto veteran Arianna Simpson, founder and managing director of Autonomous Partners, described this raise as unusual, but not surprising.  ""Usually, when a company of this size raises, it's because they aren't profitable,"" Simpson told CoinDesk, suggesting the extra funds could bolster the company's global expansion. ""[Coinbase] saw the opportunity to raise on favorable terms and they took it.""  More to come  The exact total raised in this Series E is yet to be released; a second batch of investors is still processing paperwork and endowments.  ""This was the first tranche of the primary, we still have a few remaining investors who will do the second tranche,"" Choi said. But ""that [$300 million] will be the bulk of this round.""  Venture capitalist Lasse Clausen, co-founder of the Berlin-based fund 1kx, told CoinDesk this raise was particularly impressive since Coinbase reportedly experienced a dramatic drop in active users over the last two quarters. Overall, the research firm Diar found Coinbase's dollar volumes fell 80 percent since last year.  ""The revenue and active users of Coinbase have been tanking since December 2017,"" Clausen said. ""So the fact that the investors still deployed this large investment now shows how bullish they are on crypto in the medium and long-term.""  That's why Choi said Coinbase is raising now and playing ""the long game."" The proceeds will also help fund international expansion, she said.  ""Certainly the U.K. has been a big focus for us. We'll probably have more expansion and extension in the EU more broadly,"" Choi said. ""We're definitely very bullish on Japan as the first Asian market that we really want to enter.""  Indeed, Coinbase is hiring for several roles in the new London and Tokyo offices. As such, Choi said the Series E, which valued the company at a record $8 billion, will help it make competitive employment offers.  Speaking to Coinbase's aim to eventually raise funds through an initial public offering as well, albeit not any time soon, Choi added:  ""Whenever we feel ready to be a public company, we will do that.""

In a circular issued Thursday, the financial regulator said that investment funds based in Hong Kong and that intend to invest more than 10 percent of their gross portfolios into ""virtual assets,"" either directly or indirectly via intermediaries, will have to be licensed and registered with the agency.  In a footnote, the SFC further explained that ""virtual assets"" are defined as ""digital tokens (such as digital currencies, utility tokens or security or asset-backed tokens) and any other virtual commodities, crypto assets and other assets of essentially the same nature.""  This rule applies irrespective of whether the underlying crypto assets amount to securities or futures contracts as defined in the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO), according to the statement.  Ashley Alder, the SFC's chief executive officer, said in a news release:  ""The measures announced today allow us to regulate the management or distribution of virtual asset funds in one way or another so that investors' interests would be protected either at the fund management level, at the distribution level, or both""  Jehan Chu, managing director of the Hong Kong-based crypto investment firm Kenetic Capital, said the move comes after the SFC had reached out to the industry, seeking feedback and insights.  ""We are happy to see the SFC taking concrete steps to provide clarity and guidance around digital asset management, distribution of fund interests and trading platforms, which shows that the SFC is willing to support the growth of the crypto and blockchain eco-system in a safe and sustainable manner,"" he said.  The regulator also indicated it is planning to allow cryptocurrency exchanges in the city to opt-in to a new sandbox program in a bid to determine whether to impose a licensing scheme for trading platforms in the future – an approach taken by SFC's counterpart in Japan.  Under the sandbox, the SFC said it will observe the operations of cryptocurrency exchanges and place interested and qualified parties in the regulatory sandbox after careful consideration.  ""Factors to be considered include the adequacy and effectiveness of the proposed conceptual framework; ability to comply with the terms and conditions; investors' interests; as well as local market and international regulatory developments,"" the statement reads.  Currently, none of the crypto exchanges in Hong Kong are licensed, as per the conceptual framework paper published today. If granted, they will be subject to intensive reporting and monitoring to ensure that strict internal controls are operating as expected and investor interests are protected.

42429880,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM22Th,1541044839,Bitcoin's White Paper Is Not a Bible – Stop Worshipping It,"Samson Mow is chief strategy officer at Blockstream.  This exclusive opinion piece is part of CoinDesk's ""Bitcoin at 10: The Satoshi White Paper"" series.      It's been 10 years since Bitcoin's white paper was released, and the world has had 10 years to understand the profound impact of Bitcoin. We've also had 10 years of development to improve usability and scaling.  Yet despite all this time to evolve our understanding, we somehow have had the emergence of zealots that attempt to interpret the Bitcoin white paper as if it were scripture.  The Bitcoin white paper is not a bible, it wasn't even meant to be definitive.  Case in point, Bitcoin's white paper was released in October 2008, just a few months before the source code for version 0.1 was made publicly available. But, the software itself had already been in development for a year and a half and contained features and important consensus rules that were not mentioned at all in the white paper.  ""The functional details are not covered in the paper, but the sourcecode is coming soon,"" – Satoshi Nakamoto, November 2008.  The white paper was intended as an introductory text for the cypherpunk community. Satoshi went as far as to say he was ""better with code than words"" in an email to Hal Finney shortly after the white paper's release.  This will prove obvious to those who know the code, as there are quite a few things not mentioned in the white paper, and it even included some claims that were incorrect.  21 million coin cap. Although a 'predetermined number' is referred to, Satoshi only provided the schedule and cap when he announced the release of the code.  Longest chain. The chain representing the majority-accepted transaction history is frequently referred to as the ""longest chain,"" when today we know that this is not the case. The change from 'Height' to 'ChainWork' was authored by Satoshi in July 2010. The white paper itself was not updated.  ASIC mining. CPU mining is mentioned throughout the paper. Satoshi later stated that ""compute clusters will eventually hog all the generated coins"" and that he didn't ""want to hasten that day."" Looking back, it's inevitable that a successful Bitcoin would result in CPU mining becoming irrelevant.  Difficulty algorithm. As outlined in the white paper, this would have used a moving average and not the set 2016 block periods implemented in the code, seriously altering the incentives to resist change.  Bitcoin script or smart-contract system. Satoshi would later suggest that Bitcoin scripts could be used for ""escrow transactions, bonded contracts, third party arbitration, multi-party signature,"" but script capability was not mentioned at all in the white paper.  Text in the Wind  But if the white paper quickly fell out of date, Satoshi didn't seem to notice.  He didn't even bother to correct the white paper to make it more accurately reflect the code he released. I imagine that his focus was very much on the live network's code base and not a paper that was already becoming irrelevant.  This is important to note as despite changes that altered the design of the live network substantially, the white paper has become a pseudo-religious text for some who seemed to view the subsequent open-source evolution of the code as tantamount to sacrilege. This still baffles me.  Of course, Satoshi continued to comment on and commit code to Bitcoin long after its initial release. This was a period where Satoshi was finally able to discuss with others how the system might evolve over time. His ideas were not always perfectly thought out and he didn't present himself as being infallible, yet he continued to have flairs of ingenuity.  One idea, which eventually caught the imagination of others, was payment channels or ""high frequency trades"" as he called them. This allowed users to repeatedly update the state of an unconfirmed transaction prior to it being broadcast and leveraged some of the features present in Bitcoin's code, which (*gasp*) weren't mentioned in the white paper.  This particular ""post-white paper"" idea, along with Dr. Christian Decker's ""Duplex Micropayment Channels"" paper, formed the basis of today's Lightning Network. As other developers took the concept, addressed security issues, and extended it, we now have created a rapid, peer-to-peer Bitcoin micropayments network.  The point I'm making with these examples of white paper omissions and differences to the implementation itself is that while software evolves, read-only text documents do not. The white paper was an attempt at a high-level introduction by someone who had already put far more time and care into writing the code itself.  It omitted many details that have been key to Bitcoin's success so far, and yet some people have tried elevating it to the position of holy scripture in misguided attempts to force minority design decisions.  Evolution in Progress  All this goes to show that the software itself defines what Bitcoin is and that it's been shaped by the collective vision of the majority over the years to programmatically express what rules they want to see enforced on the network.  The written word is open to personal interpretation. The execution of code isn't, and for the rules encoded in a consensus critical system, the code is all that matters.  When he published Bitcoin's source code, I think Satoshi knew that he was handing over a creation of great social value to the public, but I don't think he could have imagined how far it would come in just 10 years.  Putting the price and other distractions aside, the amount of human effort being poured into Bitcoin's infrastructure today is something that encourages me, especially as so much work is carried out by volunteers. Just consider that the latest major release (0.17) contains over 700 pull requests and 135 developers contributed to it.  Sync times are improving even though the blockchain continues to grow; we can still sync the entire Bitcoin blockchain from genesis block to chain tip in under two-and-a-half hours. Ethereum, not so much.  We have new technologies like G'Root, Bulletproofs, Confidential Transactions, Confidential Assets, PSBT, and Signature Aggregation (Schnorr) for the base layer, while the Lightning Network allows developers to experiment permissionlessly without needing consensus changes to the base protocol.  With the launch of the Liquid Network, we're starting to realize the promise of sidechains with the first real solution to improving inter-exchange settlement. All of these developments will allow innovation in the Bitcoin space to accelerate at an unprecedented pace.  A New Course  There's no question that Satoshi did everyone a great service when he released the Bitcoin source code. He used economic and social incentives to solve a problem computer scientists had been working on for years.  Perhaps an equal stroke of genius was his decision to leave the project.  By removing himself as a single point of failure and definitively handing over control of the protocol to everyone else, he let the world have a say in its evolution through the majority consensus mechanism his code incentivized.  ""Never ask what I would do. Just do what's right."" – Steve Jobs  Before Steve Jobs passed, he left these words of advice to Tim Cook. It makes sense because it wouldn't be productive or effective for Apple employees to spend their time guessing what Jobs would have wanted.  The future is always changing and past wisdom alone cannot serve as a crutch for making the correct decisions to move forward.  I'm sure Satoshi also wouldn't have wanted people to try and divine the future from his white paper, especially since the Bitcoin codebase has been extensively amended by both himself and others. You certainly can't hold up a piece of 10-year-old text and expect it to have any authority over a decentralized network of individuals making personal choices.  Let the code speak for itself.

42429882,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM22Vh,1541037902,Morgan Stanley Report Says Crypto Now An Institutional Asset Class,"Institutional investors are increasingly getting involved in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies – while the number of retail investors in the space is staying stagnant – according to a new report by Morgan Stanley.  In an update to ""Bitcoin Decrypted: A Brief Teach-In and Implications,"" the global banking giant's research division delved into the last six months of bitcoin and highlighted certain trends it noticed. The report is dated October 31.  Perhaps most notably, the report emphasized its writers' view of the market's ""rapidly morphing thesis,"" which began by defining bitcoin as ""digital cash"" and noting that investors had full confidence in it, to a solution for issues in the financial system, to a new payment system to ultimately a new institutional investment class.  Various issues and discoveries around the bitcoin ecosystem have caused the thesis to evolve, including the permanent ledger recording all transactions, a number of hacks, hard forks, new technologies which are cheaper than bitcoin, market volatility and other concerns, the report explains.  As such, the market's current thesis appears to be that bitcoin is a ""new institutional investment class,"" and has been for almost a year, the authors wrote. The amount of crypto assets under management has been increasing since January 2016, with $7.11 billion currently being stored by hedge funds, venture capital firms and private equity firms.  The fact that major financial institutions are increasingly getting involved supports this thesis, the report continued, citing Fidelity's new crypto services division, investments in Seed CX, BitGo and Binance, regulatory approvals and Coinbase's recent fundraising round.  That being said, the report did cite three issues clients had with investing in the cryptocurrency space: regulatory uncertainty, a lack of regulated custodian solutions and a current lack of large financial institutions in the space.  Stablecoin trading  The report also delved into a popular topic as of late: stablecoins, or types of cryptocurrencies that seek to enable some form of price stability.  Bitcoin is ""moving increasingly towards trading vs the stable coin USD-Tether (USDT) [sic],"" the report states, referring to the controversial, dollar-linked token operated by Tether. Half of all current bitcoin trading is now against another digital asset, continuing a trend which began last year.  The fact that many crypto exchanges do not accept fiat currencies contributed to this state of affairs, the report's authors said.  They went on to explain:  ""USDT took an increasing share of BTC trading volumes as cryptocurrency prices started falling. This occurred because many exchanges only trade crypto->crypto and not crypto->fiat. Trading crypto->fiat requires going through the banking sector which charges a higher fee. Also as bitcoin prices fell, so did most all other coins so if owners wanted to come out of bitcoin holdings, they needed to go to another asset which was closer to the valuation of the U.S. dollar.""  Crypto startups are now hopping on the trend, with exchanges and other companies developing their own stablecoins as ""part of the next wave of development.""  That being said, the researchers do not see all stablecoins surviving: only those ""with the lowest transaction costs, highest liquidity and defined regulatory structure"" are likely to see increased adoption.  Editor's note: This article has been updated to clarify that report represents the Morgan Stanley research team's view of the market's evolving thesis on bitcoin and cryptos, not their own specific thesis.
