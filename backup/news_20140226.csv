42425497,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIFc9h,1393448510,US Senator Calls for Bitcoin Ban in Letter to Top Federal Regulators,"U.S. Senator Joe Manchin, a democrat from West Virginia, has formally sent a letter to federal regulators calling for an outright ban on bitcoin and suggesting that the failure of immediate action could negatively impact US consumers.  Manchin most recently made headlines for allegedly saying that he would vote to repeal the US Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), a hallmark law of the Obama administration aimed at expanding public and private insurance coverage, though he later backtracked on the statements.  The letter  , which was sent to Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen, among other top regulators, called the digital currency ""unregulated and unstable"", and cited increasing warnings from central banks around the globe.  Said Manchin:  ""I am most concerned that as bitcoin is inevitably banned in other countries, Americans will be left holding the bag on a valueless currency.""  Notably, this is not the first time the senator has spoken out about bitcoin, having written a lengthy letter on the now-defunct online black marketplace Silk Road last June.  Black market connections  Manchin began the letter by providing a background on bitcoin, before addressing his laundry list of concerns about its use.  The senator suggested that bitcoin's features make it inherently attractive to criminals, who have used the currency to ""steal millions from bitcoins users"", and to buy drugs and weapons illegally. Further, he critiqued the irreversible nature of bitcoin transactions as the primary contributor to such issues.  ""Bitcoin’s ability to finalize transactions quickly, makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to reverse fraudulent transactions,"" the Senator said.  Consumer protection issues  The senator also suggested that bitcoin's price volatility adds to its dangers, and he cited recent developments at troubled Japan-based exchange Mt. Gox as an example. Manchin painted a picture of bitcoin as an elaborate scheme in which only early buyers, investors and miners benefit. Said Manchin:  ""There is no doubt average American consumers stand to lose by transacting in bitcoin.""  In summation, Manchin again returned to the issue of bitcoin's deflationary nature, comparing its 98% deflation to the 1.3% inflation shown in the Consumer Pricing Index. Manchin used this data to suggest spending bitcoin now would cost users wealth in the future.  ""This flaw makes Bitcoin’s value to the U.S. economy suspect, if not outright detrimental,"" said Manchin.  Regulatory impact  Manchin is not the only lawmaker weighing in on bitcoin in the wake of issues at Mt. Gox. The Texas State Securities Board and the Alabama Securities Commission have each published consumer warnings in the recent days.  However, this letter, addressed directly to new Federal Reserve Chairwoman Yellen, is unique as it will likely add fuel to speculation that the US central bank head will issue a comment or statement on digital currencies soon.

42425493,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIFc3h,1393441332,Robocoin Bitcoin ATM to Debut in North America's Largest Mall,"Las Vegas-based bitcoin ATM provider Robocoin has announced that its newest unit will open for business on 26th February at the West Edmonton Mall in Alberta, Canada, the largest shopping center in North America, and until the 2000s, the biggest shopping mall in the world.  Inspired by traditional urban bazaars, West Edmonton Mall includes 5.3 million square feet of retail space, features more than 800 stores and sees 30.8 million visitors annually. As if this wasn't enough, the mall boasts an ice skating rink, a water park and the world's largest indoor amusement park.  Drew Glover, co-CEO of BitNational, the local owners and operators of the ATM, said that West Edmonton Mall was excited to host the Robocoin unit upon learning of his plans last October, and that the attraction fit with its high-tech focus.  Explained Glover:  ""The excitement from the mall was the thing that initiated it all. We sent them a one-page letter regarding the current status of bitcoin, and we had an interview with them in two days.""  The news comes one week after the first Robocoin machine went live in Austin, Texas, a feat the company claims marked the first US bitcoin ATM, though reports suggest two Lamassu units, one in New Mexico and another in Boston, were operational prior to its launch.  Notably, no merchants at the mall accept bitcoin directly, Glover said.  Behind the launch  The unveiling will take place Thursday at 2 pm local time, an event for which Glover and his team will provide on-the-ground support in order to help interested buyers and sellers.  Unlike other ATM unveilings, Glover reported BitNational is not providing any special giveaways or discounts to the machine's first users. Glover said that the ATM's location had served as publicity enough to ensure those in the community know of its debut.  However, that isn't to say BitNational doesn't want to give back to the community.  Glover said that his own exploration of bitcoin found him frequenting the first Vancouver ATM, and he voiced his hopes this new location will help provide a similar experience to others.  ""The amount of innovative connections I made being around these centralized points of bitcoin exchange was definitely beneficial,"" Glover said.  About the operators  Framed as an investor support network, BitNational views the ATM as part of a larger plan to parlay its ""in-depth knowledge and understanding of bitcoin"" into various business opportunities.  For now, the focus will be on expanding its ATM network, and Glover said that the mall should provide a powerful platform for its goals.  Glover indicated that BitNational isn't going to be solely focusing on malls, however, as he noted the team will also be searching for new merchant and retail partners in Canada.

42425503,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIFcLh,1393437665,You Can Now Send Bitcoins Over Email With Tip Bot,"Good news, perhaps, for bitcoin owners frustrated by Apple’s recent removal of Blockchain’s wallet app from its stores.  A service just launched promises to let people make bitcoin transactions via email, promoting itself as a solution that “works natively on the iPhone, and can’t be banned by Apple”.  The fully automated ‘Email Tip Bot’ is the product of developer Christian Genco, who also moonlights as a stage actor and speaker at TEDx events in Texas.  The Tip Bot functions as a standalone system, meaning that once bitcoins are there, they can be transferred around without the need for any wallet software.  Anyone who has experienced the process of giving or receiving bitcoin tips on reddit will be familiar with the way the Tip Bot works, as the transaction process is similar.  How it works  To send some bitcoin, you first need to register your email address by sending an empty message to bitcoin@emailtipbot.com. An auto-generated reply sends you a link to confirm your email address, and provides you with a new bitcoin address. To save time, you can also pre-register email addresses on the site.  Now comes the slightly nerve-wracking part: you then send bitcoin from your own wallet to the address you have been sent. Any amount can be transferred – as much as needed for a purchase, say, or a token amount to test the system.  The system charges 0.0002 BTC (approximately 11 US cents at today’s rate) per transfer (0.0001 for the miners, 0.0001 to the bot), so make sure you allow for that in the amount sent.  Once the transaction details been emailed, send a new email to the person or address you wish to pay – putting the bitcoin@emailtipbot.com address in the ‘CC’ field and the amount (in bitcoin or dollars) in the ‘subject’ field. The email body can contain any message you like.  When their initial email has arrived, the receiver will need to click a link to confirm their email address is correct – a security measure to prevent email address spoofing.  The system will wait until it has the required amount of block chain transactions before the transaction. Then a new bitcoin address will be generated for the receiver, and their funds transferred.  It is also possible to send funds directly to a bitcoin address, by sending the email to [bitcoin address]@emailtipbot.com (while remembering, of course, to add bitcoin@emailtipbot.com to the ‘CC’ field).  For example, to donate to Wikileaks, the email address would look like this: 1HB5XMLmzFVj8ALj6mfBsbifRoD4miY36v@emailtipbot.com.  If all you have is a QR code, merely scan the code and paste the key into the address.  Similar solutions  Blockchain has a similar system, which also allows you to send bitcoins via email, SMS or even Facebook.  With this method, a private key is also sent to the user, which they can then use to withdraw to a wallet immediately and without an extra transaction fee. A Blockchain account is necessary to send, but not to receive.  Coinbase also allows users to send to an email address, the only catch being that you have to send from a Coinbase account.  Email Tip Bot's website provides an HTML button that will auto-generate the required email, if you wanted to place it on your own site. This would make it very simple for people to send you funds.  Testing, testing  CoinDesk tried the Email Tip Bot system and can report that it works, although the first time the sending email received an ‘insufficient funds’ message thanks to our not factoring in the 0.0002 BTC transaction fee.  Confirming both email addresses and waiting for block chain confirmations before sending funds is obviously not as elegant as sending directly from a wallet – at least not the first time.  Furthermore, although wallet software is not required to move the bitcoins around once the email account is set up, the sender must have one from which to transfer the initial funds.  The receiver could leave their funds in their Email Tip Bot account, but a dedicated wallet would be advisable as a more secure means of storing their coins.  However, for those times when wallet software is not readily available (hello again, iOS users), it would be handy to have a small stash of coins available to send via email.  Careful with those coins  Naturally, sending bitcoins to an address generated and emailed to you by some nameless Internet bot requires a degree of trust in the system, so it’s worth doing a test run with a small amount of BTC to start with.  Genco himself recommends people do not use the service to store any significant amount of bitcoins.  “Ultimately,” he says, “your primary store of bitcoins shouldn’t be trusted with any third-party provider. They should be stored in an offline, encrypted wallet in your control.”  “You really don’t want to be trusting even the big names in bitcoin with large amounts of your money, Most ‘bitcoin heist’ stories are possible because of improper security implementations on the bitcoin service side, and could be avoided by keeping the majority of your coins yourself.”  The email-based system means users can send coins without needing to log into web-based wallet software, and Genco acknowledges the risk that comes with that.  “This convenience means, of course, that anyone with access to your email can send coins with Email Tip Bot,” he says. “So it’s ultimately only as secure as access to your email account is.”  “Though I have secured Email Tip Bot to the best of my ability, it should be your bitcoin checking account, not your savings account.”  “I would encourage your readers to test it out with a small amount, say, $1 to $10,” he explained, “and try sending money to friends who aren’t on the bitcoin network yet, or making a small purchase from a phone.”  For nervous bitcoin users who are still hesitant to try the system out, Genco says he will be adding dogecoin support “very soon”, and plans to load up every Email Tip Bot account with a couple of hundred doge, just to play with.  The process for transacting in doge or any other digital currencies will be identical to bitcoin method described above.  Disclaimer: This article should not be viewed as an endorsement of Email Tip Bot. Please do your own research before considering spending any funds via this service.

42425507,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIFcTh,1393434466,Bitcoin Foundation Board Reveals Hopes for Charlie Shrem’s Replacement,"Following the sudden resignation of founding member and vice chairman Charlie Shrem, the Bitcoin Foundation has initiated moves to fill its first open Board of Directors seat.  The process got under way on 18th February, when it announced a formal schedule for the voting process. Under the proposed timeline, a new board member will be elected in roughly two months’ time.  Shrem’s seat has been vacant since 28th January, when he resigned amid accusations that he helped facilitate money laundering through the notorious and now-defunct online black market Silk Road.  Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles also resigned from the board on 24th February, though no timeline has yet been introduced for vetting his replacement.  In the wake of these events, the remaining members of the board continue to work to promote and protect bitcoin – a task that they say is growing in importance and difficulty in accordance with the community’s own expansion.  For example, in just the last few weeks, the foundation has needed to reassure global consumers of the safety of the Bitcoin protocol, vet local groups that can help it expand its reach, and guard against people whose bitcoin associations might harm its reputation; in addition to dealing with two high-profile resignations.  Key skills  Speaking with current board members, it becomes clear that the organization is in need of a member with a broad-ranging skill set to help the foundation advance its cause, given these new challenges.  When CoinDesk asked Shrem to describe the ideal candidate for his replacement, he said:  “Whoever takes [my] place needs to be a leader. Someone who holds the foundation at a standard of excellence and who realizes that the foundation represents what people think of bitcoin. This power does come with an immense amount of responsibility.”  The resulting appointee will also be the first individual elected to the board since September 2013, when Elizabeth T. Ploshay, manager of communications at Bitcoin Magazine, and Meyer ‘Micky’ Malka, founder and general partner at Ribbit Capital, were awarded an individual and an industry seat, respectively.  With this in mind, CoinDesk spoke to current and past board members about the upcoming election and what attributes they feel the new board member will require.  Leadership qualities  Of course, while leadership is a rather broad concept, current members of the Bitcoin Foundation were able to paint a picture of the kind of person that could most benefit the organisation.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, many of these qualities were a reflection of its recent objectives and challenges.  Bitcoin Foundation Executive Director and CoinDesk contributor Jon Matonis described his ideal candidate, emphasizing that communication will be a key attribute:  “A good candidate would understand bitcoin’s fundamental importance in the world and have a demonstrated capability of articulating that vision to a global audience.”  Ploshay, Malka and Shrem also stressed that candidates must understand that, as a board member, their actions will have a broad impact on the community. Shrem noted that this is a crucial component, in part, because of some members have erred on this point in the past.  “Unfortunately, some of the current members do not hold this responsibility and bring themselves to meaningless ‘blame games’ and lawsuits, where a real leader would look at the bigger picture,” Shrem said.  While this may seem negative, Shrem sought to be constructive with his remarks, which also cited the hard work that continues to be done by the body and his intention to do everything he legally can to provide it with support going forward.  Global expertise  Another common response from current board members was that the newest appointee should reflect the foundation’s motto, “Think Globally, Act Locally”.  This objective is top of agenda at the organization, very likely because of the recent addition of approved international chapters in Australia and Canada.  Malka echoed this necessity, saying that he believes his global experience was integral to his election. Malka grew up in Latin America, has lived in Europe, and now calls the US home.  “I believe that the more people with global experiences, or an understanding of global markets, or visions for the protocol, will be welcome,” he said.  Ploshay, however, said that candidates don’t need to have a diverse background to help the organisation improve its position globally, noting that applicants should be evaluated “regardless of where their passport is [from]”. She added:  “The most important thing is that the best candidate wins.”  Community interaction  Ploshay suggested that the election was not only the best way for the foundation to move forward, but for the community to address pertinent issues and ultimately choose an individual who can help lead such group discussions.  The board member continued, saying that the new appointee needs to be willing to share new ideas, interact with the community and operate in environments where their actions are noticed.  Malka suggested that the new member should be able to collaborate on matters of regulation. Noting the divergent opinions of bitcoin users on the subject, he explained that this means striking a sometimes complicated balance:  “You have to understand regulatory environments. I’m not saying going against them, or go for 100% of what they ask you do to [...] but you have to be willing to have that kind of mentality.”  The voting process  Of course, while the board members may have well-defined attributes in mind for an ideal colleague, only industry members of Bitcoin Foundation can vote for the open seat – meaning some of those interviewed here will not have a final say in the appointment.  As Shrem was currently serving a two-year board term set to end in December, a representative from the Bitcoin Foundation suggested the upcoming election may actually be a special election for the remainder of this period, not the full two-years. However, the Bitcoin Foundation has not responded formally to requests for clarification on the matter.  Voting will be held on 21st April. For more information on the voting process, visit the Bitcoin Foundation’s official blog for more details.

Today, CoinDesk is pleased to release its first ever 'State of Bitcoin' report.  This report is not intended to be another guide answering the question 'what is bitcoin?', which we cover in detail elsewhere on our site. Instead, the main aim is to provide an overview of key cryptocurrency trends, challenges, and opportunities, while also highlighting the most important developments over the last year.  Earlier this week we published two articles on trends in bitcoin venture capital investment which drew analysis from the report, and additional articles will follow in the weeks to come. CoinDesk will also be presenting highlights from the report at the upcoming CoinSummit conference in San Francisco on 25th - 26th March.  As anyone who follows Bitcoin closely knows, this is an extremely fast-moving space – making the production of a comprehensive while still up-to-date report extremely difficult.  Case in point: the recent developments at Mt. Gox and resultant impact on bitcoin exchanges is still very much a fluid situation. Throughout the report, every effort has been made to provide the most current data available.  Thank you to our readers for making CoinDesk the world's leading source of Bitcoin news, analysis and perspective. Our intention is to publish the 'State of Bitcoin' report on an annual or even more frequent basis, and we very much welcome your feedback and ideas on how we can make it better.

42425494,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIFc5h,1393427110,"Bitcoin is Legal, Says Central Bank of Cyprus","“Bitcoin is not illegal” say anonymous sources from the Central Bank of Cyprus (CBC), according to a report by the Cyprus Mail.  The fact remains that bitcoin is in a grey area for banks – neither a currency nor a financial instrument – and the sources warned that the digital currency isn't “subject to control or regulation”.  The Cypriot bank has recently indicated disapproval of cryptocurrencies, stating on 7th February that they were not classified as legal tender:  “The CBC does not authorise any activity falling within its mandate unless legal compliance is ensured. Any activity without the required license is liable for breach of law.”  The latest statement should, therefore, come as good news to bitcoiners fearing a government crackdown to limit rampant tax evasion as people desert a banking system they see working against their interests.  In actual fact, as a member of the Eurozone, Cyprus’s banking affairs are overseen by the European Central Bank and any future legislation of digital currencies is likely to be passed down from there.  Cash crisis  During 2012 and 2013, Cyprus experienced crippling financial problems in the fallout from the Greek debt crisis. In the months that followed, it implemented a host of austerity measures, including an infamous one-time levy on all uninsured bank deposits.  Cypriots were enraged by the move, seeing it as a robbery of the people. Interest in alternative currencies rose dramatically, causing a spike in the global price of bitcoin.  The country has a history as a financial centre and, with traditional banking deemed as a failure by much of the population, some expect Cyprus will forge a new future as a centre of bitcoin use and commerce.  Since the crisis, the University of Nicosia has started accepting bitcoin for everything from tuition fees to books and meals, and is even offering a Masters degree in Digital Currencies.  More recently, the world’s first brick-and-mortar bitcoin deposit and financial services portal, Neo, opened its flagship branch in Nicosia, with the aim of being a ‘bank’ for bitcoin.

42374545,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvlHBh,1393423663,Bitcoin Alliance of Canada to Host Bitcoin Expo in Toronto,"It is perhaps ironic that Canada, a country considering rather draconian regulations for cryptocurrency businesses, is to play host to what organizers claim will be “one of the largest planned international bitcoin events to date”.  The event, dubbed “Bitcoin Expo 2014”, is being hosted by the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada (BAC), and will take place in Toronto from 11th-13th April.  According to the BAC website, the prevailing theme of the event will revolve around the “growth and development of bitcoin communities worldwide with a focus on collaborative and decentralized models”.  Prominent bitcoin leaders, speakers, and businesses will be talking at the event, and Canada’s bitcoin communities and business startups will be given special prominence on a dedicated stage.  Impending regulation  Income from bitcoin transactions is already taxable in Canada and, although the government has been somewhat hands-off in its approach to bitcoin in the past, it is now threatening to clamp down on the country’s burgeoning cryptocurrency industry.  The country’s finance minister Jim Flaherty singled out bitcoin by name in his federal budget statement on 13th February, as he announced new laws to regulate cryptocurrencies.  Furthermore, after the publication of an internal governmental report, there are fears that the North American nation may try to ‘choke the oxygen’ out of its bitcoin ecosystem by denying Canadians access to foreign exchange markets.  Collaborative event  In spite of this, Canada currently has a thriving population of active bitcoiners and crypto companies, which the event organizers are keen to showcase.  The BAC emphasizes, however, that this is an international event, claiming it will be carried out “in a collaborative way that will benefit bitcoin communities not just in Canada but also specifically in under-developed areas and in areas where Bitcoin is still in its infancy”.  To that end, the BAC is offering scholarships to allow speakers, who might otherwise not be able to attend, the chance to make an appearance at the expo and “share valuable perspectives on bitcoin”.  BAC says that the expo will be organized and run on a non-profit basis, with all proceeds to be “returned to the Bitcoin community in a crowdsourced way”.  The speakers  Master of Ceremonies at the event will be Andreas M Antonopoulos, entrepreneur and Chief Security Officer of Blockchain.info, while over 50 notable members of the international bitcoin community will be speaking, from CEOs to libertarians and proponents of Deep Web organisations.  Notable among these are Charlie Lee, a software engineer at Coinbase and the creator of litecoin; Vitalik Buterin, co-creator of Ethereum, a decentralized mining network and software development platform; and Stephanie Murphy, co-host of the Let’s Talk Bitcoin podcast.  Jason King, founder of Sean’s Outpost – a homeless outreach programme funded by bitcoin donations – will also be speaking.  The venue  Bitcoin Expo 2014 will be held at Metro Toronto Convention Center, Canada's largest conference facility,. The venue is situated close to the city’s financial district (view an interactive map here).  The MTCC has ample parking, and a wide variety of hotels and eateries within easy reach.

Gox has issued yet another brief statement and this time it is coming straight from CEO Mark Karpeles. The troubled exchange issued a very short statement late yesterday, saying that it decided to “close all transactions” for the time being in order to “protect the site” and its users.  No change  The latest statement won’t do much to reassure customers, either. Here is what Karpeles had to say:    February 26th 2014      Dear MtGox Customers,    As there is a lot of speculation regarding Mt. Gox and its future, I would like to use this opportunity to reassure everyone that I am still in Japan, and working very hard with the support of different parties to find a solution to our recent issues.    Furthermore I would like to kindly ask that people refrain from asking questions to our staff: they have been instructed not to give any response or information. Please visit this page for further announcements and updates.    Sincerely,    Mark Karpeles    It should be noted that Karpeles is still nowhere to be found. Mt. Gox moved to new offices and Karpeles isn’t talking to the media (apart from a short statement made to Reuters). This appears to be his only formal statement since the exchange was closed a few days ago.  Serious questions persist  The fact that Karpeles and the rest of the Mt. Gox team have been so secretive ever since the exchange suspended bitcoin withdrawals is just adding insult to injury. A leaked document indicates that the exchange is insolvent, quite spectacularly so.  An online chat conversation published by Fox Business last night reportedly shows Karpeles telling a consultant that he is not giving up on Mt. Gox. In the chat, Karpeles says the leaked document was not produced by Mt. Gox, but he admits that there is some truth to it.  Even before Mt. Gox closed its doors and abandoned its offices, it was in a world of trouble. It suspended bitcoin withdrawals citing technical issues, namely transaction malleability.  Shortly thereafter, members of the bitcoin community started organising protests in front of the Mt. Gox headquarters in Tokyo. For days the offices were picketed by customers demanding their cash or bitcoins back, but eventually the company simply vanished.  Two days ago Karpeles resigned from the Bitcoin Foundation's Board of Directors. The foundation announced that Karpeles submitted his resignation and that it was effective immediately.  Now we know that Karpeles is still in Japan and that something is happening behind the scenes.

""Many USD withdrawals have been delayed beyond a limit we can accept, and it reflects poorly on our service,"" a customer support representative said.  ""All pending USD withdrawals not already in transit are being cancelled and the funds will be automatically credited back to your account.""  Customers can now select the 'Convert USD to EUR' option on its support page, either for one withdrawal or the entire account. Converting EUR amounts back to USD for USD-only bank accounts would incur a fee of less than 1%, Kraken said.  The company claims the problem was caused by a recent increase in US dollar transaction volume, much of which came from outside the United States, and temporarily overwhelmed Kraken's current US banking partner.  Don't use USD  The exchange has indicated that it actually prefers customers to use non-US currencies.  Kraken CEO Jesse Powell said US dollars represented only a small piece of the company's business, and that dealing with USD and its associated headaches cost it more in customer service and agent time than it earned in revenue.  ""We're still doing dollar withdrawals and dollar trading; we just don't want to take any more new dollars,"" he said.  ""They can still withdraw, they can still trade with dollars. We just didn't want to create any new liabilities.""  Most Kraken customers trading in USD are not even US residents. Powell recommended those customers should switch to euros, where liquidity was greater and transaction fees were lower.  ""We haven't even been going after the US market at all. We just offer the dollar because we're able to. In hindsight we probably should not have [...] at least until we have a more robust banking partner.""  ""In the meantime we're emailing all the users with dollar balances, offering to convert their balances to euros; they can trade on the euro if they want to.""  New banking partner  The company was currently in negotiation with a couple of other banks, Powell said, and would reactivate USD deposits then.  Despite the recent debacle surrounding Mt. Gox, he said while Kraken had ""not heard any panicked phone calls"" the topic had a chilling effect and was bound to come up in meetings over the next couple of days.  ""I don't see the point of offering a service that's just going to be an exercise in frustration,"" he concluded.  ""If it's not a good service, if we can't do it well, then why do it?""",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/26/kraken-halts-usd-deposits-asks-customers-to-switch-to-euros,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ee573bd500e18702c47e5dd9d481aea9b76b3c7f-1000x734.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425499,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIFcDh,1393413909,Mt. Gox Faces US Subpoena and Investigation in Japan,"The Mt. Gox maelstrom is starting to attract attention from law enforcement in Japan and the US.  According to the Wall Street Journal, Mt. Gox has been subpoenaed by the US Attorney’s office in New York. Additionally, a few thousand miles west, Japanese officials have confirmed that local authorities are looking into the matter, too.  The Wall Street Journal cites an unnamed source, which revealed the federal subpoena was sent this month. Details are rather thin on the ground and at this point in time it remains unclear when the subpoena was sent, or what it is all about.  In any case, federal prosecutors don’t tend to waste their time in vain and the fact that the attorney’s office is declining to comment the matter is consistent with an ongoing investigation.  Japan authorities ""gathering information""  As for Japan, it might be even more serious, as Japanese authorities are already looking into the closure of Mt. Gox.  ""At this stage the relevant financial authorities, the police, the Finance Ministry and others are gathering information on the case,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference, Reuters reports.  Suga stopped short of saying what sort of investigation has been launched. It should be pointed out that Japan’s Financial Services Agency and the Ministry of Finance insist that they simply do not have jurisdiction over Mt. Gox. The Bank of Japan has not commented publicly, either.  However, Suga also mentioned the police, so it is plausible that he is talking about a criminal investigation – although this is not something we can confirm at this time.  Mt. Gox still isn't saying much  For its part, Mt. Gox is still practically silent. Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles isn’t talking to the media, but he did tell Reuters that the exchange should have an official announcement ready “soon-ish”. He added that Mt. Gox is “at a turning point” and that he cannot say more as other parties are involved.  The only things coming out of Mt. Gox are new revelations that are anything but positive.  Fox Business published an online chat between Karpleles and consultant Jon Fisher that all but confirmed that leaked documents purporting the exchange’s insolvency are more or less true, although he insists they were not produced by Mt. Gox.  Karpeles mentioned “other parties” in his response to Reuters, but it remains unclear who produced the documents and how (or why) they were leaked.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/26/mt-gox-faces-us-subpoena-and-investigation-in-japan,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4125828b2dc511895755f4ef3028e77ae9e585cd-1000x663.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425510,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIFcZh,1393379497,Mt. Gox CEO Says Leaked Documents More or Less Legit,"Mark Karpeles, CEO of troubled Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, has responded informally to reports of major problems at his business and rumors that his company will be rebranding its services.  In an online chat conversation published by Fox Business, Karpeles told consultant Jon Fisher that he is not giving up on Mt. Gox.  When asked by Fisher if documents purporting the exchange's insolvency are true, Karpeles replied:  ""As the name suggests it's a draft, and it's a bunch of proposals to deal with the issue at hand, not things that are actually planned and/or done.""  Karpeles also revealed his company was not the author of the document, titled 'Crisis Strategy Draft', saying:  ""This document was not produced by MtGox""  The news comes as the ripple effects of Mt. Gox's abrupt closure continue to be felt in the industry in the actions of business partners and the movements of the overall market.  Volume  Regulatory pressure has been a big problem for Mt. Gox according to Karpeles:  ""The pressure we got from banks and governments make things very hard""  Prior to the suspension of trading that then led to the site going offline, Mt. Gox was one of the biggest US dollar bitcoin exchanges.  According to Bitcoin Charts market data, Mt. Gox's previous 30-day volume was 1,030,921 BTC, valued at $377,383,264.92 USD.  By volume, Mt. Gox was still the biggest exchange for the BTC/USD trading pair.  Reaction  Major news outlets are reporting that Mt. Gox's problems ""spell doom"" for bitcoin, or that there is at least ""bitcoin turmoil"".  Jon Matonis, the president of the Bitcoin Foundation, tweeted that a systematic failure of this major bitcoin exchange is quite different from centralized financial systems:    If MtGox operated in traditional financial system, losses would be ""papered over"" by the regulators and government insurers (i.e. taxpayers)          — Jon Matonis (@jonmatonis) February 25, 2014    Some are taking heed to investor Marc Andreessen's assessment that there is a MF Global comparison to be made regarding Mt Gox.    @jonmatonis While no one is happy about #MFGox, at least there is no bail out.          — BTC Talks (@BTCTalks) February 25, 2014    Karpeles maintains he is not in hiding, posting this image of his workspace, and as reported by Fox Business he is:  “At home, with my cat being a pain sleeping on the keyboard.”  Full Chat Log  CoinDesk is monitoring this developing story, and will post updates as they become known.
