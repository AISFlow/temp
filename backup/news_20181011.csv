42429812,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1Tnh,1539286854,Crypto Defender Spars With Famed Critic During US Senate Hearing,"Advocacy versus skepticism. ""Dr. Doom"" versus ""Captain Coin."" Whatever you want to call it, two divergent viewpoints on the topic of cryptocurrency collided before a group of U.S senators on Thursday.  Economist Nouriel Roubini – famous for predicting the 2008 financial crisis testified about the blockchain and crypto ecosystems before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs alongside Coin Center director of Research Peter Van Valkenburgh.  And as his written testimony indicated, Roubini took a harsh stance against the technology and its proponents in front of the lawmakers.  ""Crypto is the mother and father of all scams … [and] blockchain is the most overhyped technology ever and is no better than a glorified database,"" Roubini said in his opening statement.  Van Valkenburgh took a somewhat more nuanced approach, telling the committee that while blockchain and cryptocurrencies are not perfect or even fully complete at present, they are a significant step in improving the financial situation for many.  He cited the story of Roya Mahboob, who was unable to pay her employees as many did not have bank accounts. Instead, she paid using bitcoin.  In his statement, Van Valkenburgh said:  ""Bitcoin is the world's first globally accessible public money. Is it perfect? No. Neither was email when it was invented in 1972. Bitcoin's not the best money on every margin. It's not yet accepted everywhere. It's not used often to quote prices and it's not a stable store of value.""  ""But it is working, and the fact that it works without intermediaries is amazing,"" he added.  Congressional focus  The eight senators (out of a possible 25 on the committee) who asked questions at the hearing split their time relatively evenly between concerns about criminal activity, market activities and use cases.  However, unlike some of the previous hearings on the industry, Thursday's hearing was entirely educational on the lawmakers' part. No actions regarding the cryptocurrency space were proposed or called for during the proceedings.  As such, much of the focus during the session remained on what issues blockchain might pose and what problems the technology might help solve. It was here that the two witnesses diverged sharply.  Corporations and banks will likely not use decentralized ledgers unless they can maintain full control, Roubini asserted.  On the other hand, ""roughly half of all Americans, 143 million people, had their Social Security numbers stolen because of a breach at Equifax,"" Van Valkenburgh noted during a list of potential disruptions caused by centralized institutions which maintain poor security practices.  In response to another question by Senator Doug Jones, Roubini stated that criminals are using cryptocurrencies in a number of activities, including tax evasion, claiming that the anonymity granted to users allows them to hide from legal authorities.  ""I would be interested in knowing how you can use something that isn't money to evade taxes ... It's not anonymous at all ... several law enforcement officials and investigators who enjoy doing blockchain investigations because you can track [activities],"" Van Valkenburgh retorted.  What the ideals behind blockchain ultimately come down to, Van Valkenburgh said during his testimony, is the fact that many private corporations currently act as single points of failure in banking, communications and other services, and though these corporations may be important to society, ""no critical infrastructure should be wholly dependent on one or two.""  He concluded:  ""[Blockchain] is not yet ready to answer all of these problems but it is our best hope, and as with the Internet in the 90s, we need light-touch pro-innovation policy to ensure that these innovations flourish in America for the benefit and security of all Americans.""  Post-hearing takes  The differences between the two attendees were further put on display by way of comments published after the appearance before the U.S. senators.  Following the event, Van Valkenburgh said in a statement that he appreciated ""the opportunity to present the committee with real-world examples of the value public blockchain networks can bring to society, and to respond to some of the criticisms that have been leveled against them for years.""  In contrast, Roubini took aim at the many social media critics who responded disdainfully to his remarks as the hearing went on.  Roubini tweeted  :  ""Crypto twitter is a cesspool of bots, trolls, shills, scammers, crypto zealots and lunatics. Barking dogs that attack me after losing 90 [percent] in last year. None read my paper & none have any substantial critique. This motley crew is a bunch of pathetic lunatics & HODLing losers""  Nouriel Roubini image via U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/10/11/crypto-defender-spars-with-famed-critic-during-us-senate-hearing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e00fc142551fd7e75679f5d0f4cdab5f595eed63-1919x1073.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced Thursday, the exchange said in a blog post that it had begun accepting deposits for ZRX, and would enable trading around 5:00 A.M. UTC, or after at least 12 hours after the initial announcement. The move represents the first time the platform has added support for an ERC-20 token that runs on the ethereum network.  ""Once sufficient liquidity is established, trading will begin on the ZRX/USD, ZRX/EUR and ZRX/BTC order books. ZRX trading will be accessible for users in most jurisdictions, but will not initially be available for residents of the state of New York,"" Coinbase Pro general manager David Farmer wrote.  While ZRX is available through Coinbase Pro, it is not presently available to investors through coinbase.com, or its iOS and Android apps.  Like some of its previous rollouts, the addition of ZRX will see four stages: transfer-only, post-only, limit-only and full trading.  The token's price began pumping after the announcement, jumping to its highest point since mid-August, according to data from CoinMarketCap. As of press time, the token's price hovered at 84.9 cents, up 13 percent on the day.  ZRX/USD Daily Chart  As can be seen in the above chart, the surge in ZRX price began a few minutes before 17:00 UTC to ultimately reach a 31 percent increase from the daily low of $0.64. The announcement was published at 17:00.  A Coinbase spokesperson confirmed that the announcement was published at exactly 17:00, but noted that the platform began accepting deposits at 16:55 UTC to ensure the process would work smoothly.  Coinbase first indicated that it might add ZRX to its platform in July when it announced it was looking into a number of tokens for listing.

CipherTrace estimates the total figure will reach over $1 billion by the end of 2018.  The most notable theft of the year 2018 was the hack of Japanese exchange Coincheck, which saw $530 million-worth of cryptos stolen.  Other major breaches included a number of crypto exchanges such as Italy's BitGrail ($195 million), Japan's Zaif (around $60 million) and South Korea's Coinrail (over $40 million) and Bithumb (over $30 million). Other types of businesses hit included token creation platform Bancor ($23.5 million) and Geth, an ethereum client (over $20 million).  While the biggest attacks dominated the headlines, the report also cited a steadily growing number of ""smaller"" thefts in the range of $20 million–$60 million, totaling $166 million since the second quarter report.  The report states:  ""This data indicates a pattern of smaller robberies on a regular basis and sophisticated professional cyber thieves who carry out hacks at both the exchange and platform levels by capitalizing on exposed vulnerabilities, as well as by socially engineering employees who work at these companies.""  Some other hacks such as the CoinHoarder phishing thefts, estimated at $50 million, were excluded from the report, CipherTrace said, adding that it will include them in the 2018 annual report if the figures can be confirmed. The firm also said that it is aware of an over $60 million hack, which has not been reported publicly.  CipherTrace further revealed that 97 percent of the direct bitcoin payments from criminals went to exchanges in countries with weak anti-money laundering (AML) laws, and that the exchanges have laundered a significant amount of bitcoin, totaling 380,000 BTC or $2.5 billion at current prices.  Some governments around the world have taken stricter measures to curb the thefts, the report said, while many other governments are expected to come up with tighter cryptocurrency AML regulations by the end of this year.  Dave Jevans, CEO of CipherTrace, said in a press release:  ""Different geographies are competing on regulations and trying to become 'trusted' digital currency hubs in order to grow their economies. We will see the opportunities to launder cryptocurrencies greatly reduced in the coming 18 months as cryptocurrency AML regulations are rolled out globally.""  Earlier today, CoinDesk reported that Tech Bureau, the firm behind Zaif, has revealed a new plan to compensate users after a major hack last month that would see it taken over by another crypto exchange.  CoinDesk also previously reported that the Bancor team managed to block the transfer of 2.5 million of its BNT tokens (worth around $10 million), reducing its total loss to $13.5 million.

Ringgold and BlockVest, the agency said, ""were using the SEC seal without permission, a violation of federal law, and falsely claiming their crypto fund was 'licensed and regulated.'""  ""Blockvest and Ringgold also allegedly misrepresented Blockvest's connections to a well-known accounting firm, and continued their fraudulent conduct even after the National Futures Association (NFA) sent them a cease-and-desist letter to stop them from using the NFA's seal and from making false claims about their status with that organization,"" the SEC said in a statement.

A hearing is scheduled for Oct. 18, the SEC said, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California.

42429810,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1Tlh,1539266984,Twitter Promoted a Fake Elon Musk Crypto Giveaway Scam,"A verified Twitter account masquerading as Elon Musk was used to publish and circulate a promoted tweet for a crypto giveaway scam Thursday morning.  The since-deleted tweet was posted through the account @TylerFlorence, which as of press time is still accessible. A link posted to the tweet directs to a giveaway site (which CoinDesk is not linking), prompting users to ""sеnd frоm 0.2 to 5 BTC tо the address bеlow and gеt frоm 1 to 100 ВTC back!""  The news triggered an outcry from users who saw the tweet, renewing scrutiny of the social media platform's anti-scam practices.  The incident is notable given that it involved a verified account but also that the scam information was circulated by way of a promoted tweet. Promoted tweets are paid for and are generally used by advertisers to reach a wider audience than they normally would through their existing network of followers, taking advantage of search trends (in this case, the public interest around the controversial Tesla CEO) to boost performance and visibility.  Twitter has long faced criticism for the prevalence of giveaway scams. Indeed, Elon Musk's identity has been used in the past by other would-be scammers hoping to parlay Musk's popularity in order to trick users into thinking that he is, in fact, giving away cryptocurrency.  In August, a group of researchers published evidence of a massive botnet fueling crypto scams on Twitter, utilizing fake accounts to give the appearance that real people were interacting with the giveaway organizers.  It's an issue that Musk himself is fully aware of, having posted about the issue last month. At the time, he sought help from crypto-community members, including dogecoin creator Jackson Palmer, in an effort to block the scam solicitations from his feed.  Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Hurun, the organization that tracks high net-worth individuals in China and worldwide, on Wednesday released its latest list of the wealthiest executives in China – all being worth at least 2 billion yuan, or $288 million.  Based on the report, six people from major bitcoin mining firms and cryptocurrency exchanges now hold a net worth of more than $1 billion each, while, in total, 13 executives from the industry made it to the list.  Notably, Zhan Ketuan, chairman and co-founder of the five year-old, Beijing-based mining firm Bitmain, is the only person to be listed among the top 100 richest in China (ranked 95th), with 29.5 billion yuan (or $4.25 billion), the report shows.  Zhan is followed by Wu Jihan, also a co-founder of Bitmain, who has 16.5 billion yuan, or $2.38 billion, in net worth.  Founders of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges have also become newly made billionaires, despite the recent downturn in the cryptocurrency market. Binance's Zhao Changpeng, Huobi's Li Lin and OKCoin's Star Xu, are the next on the list among the richest cryptocurrency entrepreneurs, with $2.1 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1 billion in net worth, respectively.  The report also estimated the wealth of Li Xiaolai, the English teacher-turned crypto investor, at around 7 billion yuan, or $1 billion.  Also notably, six out of the total 13 crypto executives who made it to the list are from Bitmain, while three come from the firm's rival chip maker Canaan Creative. Another hails from the network hardware-turned bitcoin miner maker Ebang.  So far, all of the three mining firms have filed applications to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, seeking to go public in the Chinese autonomous territory and economic hub. Huobi, on the other hand, recently announced it had purchased over 60 percent of a Hong Kong-listed company – a move that could help the exchange go public via a reverse takeover.

According to various employment ads posted on Tuesday, the central bank is currently hiring four engineers with expertise on system architecture, chip design, blockchain development and application, cryptography and security protocol design.  Based on the job descriptions, the engineers will be responsible for developing a fiat-linked digital currency software, a cryptography and security model, and a chip processor for making end-point digital currency transactions.  Further, the central bank is also seeking to boost its manpower for the study of the legal and economic implications of launching a CBDC.  The PBoC lab aims to recruit two experts in finance and economics to focus on analyzing the economic theory and designing a monetary mechanism for issuing a CBDC, as well as any potential regulatory risks.  While the central bank didn't reveal the current size of its digital currency research team, which was launched in July last year, the hunt for new talent signals the central bank is doubling down on its efforts to develop and roll out a yuan-based national digital currency with the core features of a cryptocurrency.  The recruitment drive follows a recent CoinDesk report that the digital currency lab had filed more than 40 patent applications within 12 months of its establishment, which combine to outline the big picture of how the PBoC is approaching its goal.  Each of the application focuses on a certain aspect of a digital currency system.

42429822,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1U7h,1539255626,4 Reasons Why Bitcoin's Price Could Now Drop to $6K,"Bitcoin's drop to three-week lows today has likely kick-started a bearish move towards the major support at $6,000, technical charts indicate.  The leading cryptocurrency fell to $6,252 at 7:15 UTC on Bitfinex – the lowest level since Sept. 19 – and was last seen trading at $6,300, representing a 5-percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  The failure to capitalize on Monday's move above the crucial 10-week exponential moving average (EMA) resistance of $6,998, despite the upside break of a key falling trendline, ended up emboldening the bears, as expected.  More importantly, the sell-off witnessed in the last few hours has put an end to a prolonged period of lateral trading. The technical indicators have rolled over in favor of the bears, adding credence to the bearish setup on the long duration charts.  Further, the big drop in the equity markets this morning may not bode well for BTC, as the cryptocurrency is still being treated as a risk asset.  As a result, the cryptocurrency is eyeing a drop toward $6,000. Here are four reasons why that is looking likely:  Bollinger band breakdown  The Bollinger bands (standard deviation of +2, -2 on the 20-day moving average) on the daily chart have been moving in a sideways manner since Sept. 22, signaling a lack of clear directional bias.  As a result, bitcoin price volatility, as represented by Bollinger bandwidth and the gap between weekly high and low, fell to 21-month lows and 15-month lows, respectively, last week.  A prolonged period of low volatility usually makes way for a big move in either direction. In BTC's case, that move looks to have already started to the downside, with a breach of the lower band, and may move further towards $6,000.  Indicators are biased toward the bears  The relative strength index (RSI) has breached the rising trendline and fell into the bearish territory below 50.00. Notably, it is pointing lower and is well short of the oversold region (below 30.00), meaning there is enough room for a sell-off to $6,000.  Meanwhile, the choppiness index has dropped below the 61.8 level and is pointing south, indicating that bearish move is gathering strength.  Further, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) has produced a bearish crossover.  Long-term charts retain a bearish bias  The bearish view put forward by the negative crossover between the 5-month and 10-month EMAs has gained more credence, courtesy of BTC's failed breakout and a drop to three-week lows.  Notably, the moving averages turned bearish last month for the first time since September 2014.  Stock market sell-off could add to the bearish pressure  BTC's drop to lows below $6,300 comes a day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) shed 800 points. This isn't the first time that the leading cryptocurrency has followed the action in the equity markets.  As seen in the chart above, BTC pretty much mimicked the DJIA in the last quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018.  Looking ahead, the equities could drop further, courtesy of the rising bond yields, and push BTC lower.  While many argue that BTC is a safe haven asset, the historical price action suggests that it in fact tracks equity markets. This is hardly surprising as BTC is still struggling to get mainstream exposure and investors may feel more secure with other classic safe-haven assets like gold (currently at $1,200 per Oz), which is also struggling to post gains.  View  BTC risks falling to $6,000 in the short-term as various indicators have turned bearish  A violation there would allow a deeper drop to $5,870 – support of the trendline drawn from the June low of $5,755 and the August low of $5,859.  The bearish case would weaken if the 21-month EMA, currently located at $6,122, proves a tough nut to crack.  On the higher side, the 10-day EMA is the level to beat for the bulls. A weekly close on Sunday (as per UTC) above that level would put the bulls back into the driver's seat.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42429816,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1Txh,1539248445,'Doctor Doom' vs Crypto: Here's What to Expect in Congress Today,"Famed economist Nouriel Roubini plans to strike a fiery tone on cryptocurrency and blockchain before a group of U.S. senators on Thursday.  Roubini will testify before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs alongside Coin Center director of research Peter Van Valkenburgh in a hearing entitled ""Exploring the Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Ecosystem.""  Announced last week, the hearing marks the latest move by members of the U.S. Congress to better understand the emerging technology and asset class.  In prepared remarks published Wednesday, Roubini, who was given the nickname ""Dr. Doom"" for his predictions about the 2008 financial crisis, plans to come out swinging, arguing cryptocurrencies are not a viable unit of account, means of payment or store of value.  Among the arguments: Roubini contends that ""wealth in crypto-land is more concentrated than in North Korea, where the inequality Gini coefficient is 0.86.""  The Gini coefficient is a measure of economic inequality and works by comparing income distribution (or possibly wealth distribution) among a population, according to Investopedia. The coefficient can range from 0, or perfect equality, to 1, or perfect inequality.Bitcoin's Gini coefficient is 0.88, he said, though he did not reference how he established that number.  In contrast to Roubini's rhetoric on ""a failing set of technologies,"" Van Valkenburgh's prepared testimony argues that ""decentralized computing"" can prove beneficial in a number of different use cases, provided lawmakers and regulators allow developers to experiment with the technology and grow the space.  Van Valkenburgh's testimony pushes back against some of the hype surrounding the space as well, noting that blockchain ""is not"" a ""solution to any number of social, economic, organizational or cybersecurity problems.""  It even goes as far as to say that the phrase ""'blockchain technology' is a vague and undefined buzzword.""  His tone strikes a stark difference from Roubini's, calling for ""a light-touch approach"" to regulation, similarly to how former U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration approached the development of the internet.  Elsewhere, Roubini notes that ""blockchains can make sense in cases where the speed/verifiability tradeoff is actually worth it,"" but adds that ""this is rarely how the technology is marketed. Blockchain investment propositions routinely make wild promises to overthrow entire industries, such as cloud computing, without acknowledging the technology's obvious limitations.""  Ongoing conversation  The Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee has discussed the cryptocurrency space before. Earlier this year, the committee saw U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Jay Clayton and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chair J. Christopher Giancarlo testify on what their agencies saw as pressing needs for regulating the space.  While Clayton said at the time that the securities regulator may ask for legislation approving additional oversight on the space, neither the request nor any such legislation has materialized to date.  In fact, while there are a number of bills sitting before the Senate and the House of Representatives, few have been signed into law so far.  That hasn't stopped startups from launching tokens or working toward building the ""Web 3.0,"" inspiring much of Roubini's previous pushback.  Nor has Roubini held back in the run-up to the hearing.  On Twitter, the economist has blasted cryptocurrencies and the space in general, saying in one tweet that ""Decentralization in crypto is a myth ... miners are centralized, exchanges are centralized, developers are centralized dictators (Buterin is ""dictator for life"").""  In another tweet, he piled on, saying that ""calling this crappy garbage of 1000s of alt-coins – that lost 99 percent of their value since peak – as 'shit-coins' is a grave insult to manure that is a most useful, precious and productive good as fertilizer in agriculture. So apologies to manure for this offensive comparison.""  (He also apologized to the Senate committee for using the word ""shitcoin,"" but noted that it was a commonly used ""technical term"" in the space, citing a Google search.)  On the other side of the debate, Van Valkenburgh concludes in his remarks:  ""Just as few would have predicted the emergence of Facebook or Uber given only an understanding of the internet circa 1995, it is impossible to know what creative and diverse minds will build when offered a free and public platform for experimentation.""

42429809,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1Tjh,1539244812,US Customs Agency Hopes to Evaluate Blockchain Pilot by December,"The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) plans to evaluate its foray into blockchain technology by the end of the year.  Members of a government advisory group, the Commercial Customs Operations Advisory Committee (COAC), met on October 3 to advocate for regulatory reform around different trade-focused areas, with ""emerging technologies"" coming up as a point of conversation.  In particular, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) representatives said the agency has concluded its latest round of testing blockchain technology for supply chain management, according to a press release published Tuesday.  CBP is working to determine if a blockchain-based platform can streamline the agency's efforts to track shipments around the world as part of the soon-to-be-replaced North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), as previously reported.  Celeste Catano, global product manager at BluJay Solutions, a supply chain software company working with the agency, said CBP is currently evaluating its proposed use of blockchain technology, adding that ""we hope to have some recommendations by the December meeting.""  ""We just completed our testing last week on the blockchain solution for NAFTA and CAFTA verifications,"" Catano told the meeting's attendees.  Members of the project met after last week's meeting to assess the test, including what can be improved and whether blockchain ""is ... the right technology for these types of projects,"" she said.  Testing underway  CBP is one of a number of U.S. agencies looking at possible applications of blockchain, having detailed its ""live fire"" testing in August.  Vincent Annunziato, director of the CBP's Automated Commercial Environment Business Office, explained during the October meeting that the agency is currently in the ""proof-of-concept"" phase, adding:  ""We've produced a hybrid system that allows public sharing of data and also maintains the security of that data. It's particularly important for keeping trade secrets and that's what this architecture is designed to do.""  That being said, the agency is proceeding cautiously and is only looking to provide a small level of funding at the moment.  ""If we find something that doesn't work, we don't invest anymore. If we find that it does work, then we move forward with confidence. This is new ground for us, so it's exciting,"" he said.

42401946,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd38e0,1539240038,"South Korea to Decide on ICO Legality in November, Official Says","The South Korean government will make a decision in November on whether it will allow initial coin offerings (ICOs) again in the country, a top-level official has said.  Hong Nam-ki, head of the office for government policy coordination, told lawmakers during the National Assembly's annual audit on government actions that regulators in the country have been reviewing the topic in recent months, as CoinDesk Korea reported on Thursday.  Hong added that the Financial Services Commission (FSC), South Korea's markets watchdog, has been conducting surveys on ICOs since September.  ""We are going to form the position of the government in November based on the results of the investigation at the end of October,"" he went on to say.  Hong was responding to the question on ICO permission raised by Jeon Haecheol, a lawmaker from the ruling Democratic Party, who voiced support for lifting the current ICO ban.  Jeon said during the questioning:  ""If we waste time, the blockchain industry could face huge difficulties. We need to look at very realistic and specific ways to nurture the blockchain industry, and I think permitting ICOs is one of them.""  That said, Choi Jong-gu, chairman of the FSC, voiced his concern again in a meeting today against the idea of allowing ICOs, according to a news report from Yonhap.  ""Many people say ICOs should be allowed, but ... uncertainty remains, and the damage is too serious and obvious,"" he was quoted as saying.  In September 2017, the FSC notably issued a ban on domestic ICOs, following a similar move made by regulators in China. However, Hong said some crypto projects continued selling tokens to domestic residents by registering their businesses overseas.  In May, lawmakers from the National Assembly, the country's legislative arm, pushed for the removal of the ICO ban. And last month, CoinDesk reported the FSC was investigating token sales projects with a questionnaire seeking information on extensive project details as part of its effort to review the ICO ban case.  Elsewhere in Hong's remarks, he reiterated the government's commitment to supporting blockchain development with a government budget of 34 billion won ($30 million) in the coming years.

Tech Bureau said in a release Wednesday that it had signed an agreement with Fisco – a publicly listed investment firm in Japan – to transfer in full the Zaif business to Fisco's existing cryptocurrency exchange.  In return, the new owner will take on the responsibility for compensating users who lost funds in the breach. The two stated this approach would avoid further risks for Fisco and users on the platform.  Zaif, currently one of the 16 licensed crypto exchanges in Japan, experienced the hack on Sept. 20, when some $60 million in cryptocurrencies were stolen, including nearly 6,000 bitcoin. Other compromised assets included bitcoin cash and the monacoin cryptocurrency, as CoinDesk reported at the time.  The statement indicated that Fisco would use its own bitcoin and bitcoin cash to refund users who had lost holdings of the two crypto assets. According to a statement by Fisco, the company started operating a bitcoin exchange in August 2016.  As for those who lost monacoin, Tech Bureau said Fisco would pay back users in the Japanese yen at a rate of 144.548 yen, or $1.28, per token. At press time, one monacoin is trading at $1.14, according to CoinMarketCap data.  Immediately after the hack, Tech Bureau had made an initial agreement with Fisco that the latter would offer 5 billion yen, or $44.5 million, to support Zaif's compensation plan and to acquire a major stake in the platform. Yet after negotiations, the initial plan was changed to encompass a full transfer of the company.  The two now expect to host shareholder meetings in October before they execute the business transfer on Nov. 22.  Once the process is complete, Tech Bureau plans to dissolve its cryptocurrency exchange business and cancel its license with the Financial Services Agency, Japan's financial market regulator, the statement said.

Bitcoin was last seen trading at $6,238.  At press time, bitcoin has lost momentum, having stalled briefly at around $6,125, the lowest figure since September 19, before crossing back above $6,200.

42401956,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd38mr,1539216352,A War-Torn Country in Syria Will Use Crypto to Power an Anarchist State,"A region home to 4 million people in Northern Syria is looking to cryptocurrency as a way to overcome economic sanctions.  Rojava, also known as the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria, has spent the last six years at war for its territory. Now under a fragile peace, the region is under economic sanctions from all sides – Turkey, Iran, Syria, Iraq. In the midst of this uncertainty, however, those backing the state are putting a new emphasis on monetary independence.  Because its primary currency is the Syrian lira, the main currency of the Syrian state (which Rojava has just spent years fighting), there's a growing belief in some quarters that cryptocurrency could provide a better alternative, Erselan Serdem, a leader of Rojava's technological development program, told CoinDesk.  Alongside a system of self-governing communes, Rojava plans to implement new technological academies, with a particular emphasis on cryptography and cryptocurrency, Serdem said.  Assisting the change is Amir Taaki, an early bitcoin developer who fought alongside Rojava in the war. As detailed by CoinDesk, Taaki is also in the process of setting up a European-based technological academy in Barcelona.  ""[Rojava is] a revolutionary project that wants to build a new society based on anarchist principles, and that means law, defense, society and culture,"" Taaki told CoinDesk.  The new academies follow the philosophy of Kurdish political theorist Abdullah Ocalan, who is promoting a form of governance called ""democratic confederalism."" Advocating for direct democracy, feminism and ecology, Serdem said that blockchain and cryptocurrency are crucial for achieving this vision.  ""You need technology to spend less water, you need technology to have an equal relation with the earth, you need technology to use networks, like the blockchain. We see blockchain as a practical network in society that people use,"" Serdem said.  And while achieving adoption for a cryptocurrency throughout the region is an ambitious project, Serdem believes Rojava's experience in war has given it the ability to both organize effectively and to set a positive example for the world.  ""We have to think deeply about the future of the new system, and how the people can arrange and manage resources democratically without any form of centralization,"" Serdem continued, adding:  ""We call our system a decentralized system of society.""  New infrastructure  The push toward cryptocurrency is notable because, at the time of writing, Rojava's economy is based purely on paper currencies, according to Taaki, who spent nearly two years in the country during the conflict.  Taaki reports that, as a consequence, a large infrastructure has developed around the processing of fiat currencies, with centers throughout the country dedicated solely to accounting. Combined with high inflation, this means that locals depend on large amounts of cash to secure trades.  Economic sanctions with neighboring countries also mean that in order to send money outside the region, payments are subject to high fees.  ""The cost of making a transaction with Istanbul is currently 10 percent,"" Taaki said, ""We believe that with cryptocurrency we can make this 2 percent globally, not just with Istanbul.""  As such, Taaki said the first steps are to equip local currency exchanges with bitcoin and providing residents with wallet software that has been translated into local languages. Additionally, payment infrastructures such as bitcoin's lightning network, or a custom payment network, could be deployed to make trade fast, cheap and secure.  Research is currently being conducted into solutions that don't rely on the internet, such as cryptocurrency transmitted over radio, and paper-based currencies that are pegged to crypto.  ""Not everybody has mobile phones, so we see research into paper currency as an important project,"" Taaki said.  Yet, while work still remains before cryptocurrency adoption is actionable in the region, Taaki and Serdem emphasized that the steps are necessary to ensure Rojava's autonomy from neighboring forces.  ""We do not like to depend on the Syrian government money, which is state money, we want to trade our own cryptocurrency,"" Serdem said.  Still, he emphasized that an underlying analysis must be completed before cryptocurrency can be implemented, one that will require intensive documentation of human population and surveys of geography and natural resources, such as oil, water and sunlight.  ""It's about resources,"" Serdem said, ""To create academies you need to have a resource, to make blockchain network we also need resources. We need to calculate all the resources and use it in the process.""  Beyond money  Underpinning Rojava's new society is a system of cooperatives that each fulfill different functions within society.  For example, cooperatives that perform roles like healthcare, agriculture, media and the arts, are comprised of volunteers – maintaining a strong principle of non-coercion. Going forward, Taaki said the technological committee will help establish local cryptocurrencies to allow these cooperatives to engage in trade, as well as issuing financial instruments that can be used for fundraising.  ""The cooperatives can trade with each other based on currencies that are pegged to a basket of goods, or just free floating in the market,"" Taaki said.  Additionally, the technological committee has plans to use blockchain beyond its implications in finance as well.  For example, Serdem said that blockchain could be deployed as a new governance infrastructure that allows for distributed, democratic control and a high level of transparency.  ""With technologies like blockchain we can have a system, like a network, between all the communes we're going to create in the future,"" Serdem said,  ""With the base of the blockchain we can create a process of self administration. We can distribute all the roles in the society.""  Toward this, the technological committee will experiment with new forms of digital governance that fulfill Rojava's democratic ideals.  For example, blockchain technologies could allow people to assert power over institutions, to establish smart contracts to formalize relationships and to oversee operations in a transparent manner.  ""Rojava is a good opportunity to see how it works in practice,"" Serdem said.  Revolutionary hackers  With these tools, Rojava wishes to set an example of democratic society throughout the Middle East and the world.  Crucially, Serdem emphasized that such change will be achieved not by violent measures, but by demonstrating to the world that another system is possible – one that operates in tandem with ecology, autonomy and self-administration.  ""We do not use the force to develop this idea, it's about evolution,"" Serdem said.  Such evolution resides on a subtle updating of old systems with new technologies, Serdem continued, that lends the movement a strength that former revolutions haven't achieved.  Additionally, the project looks to attract allies throughout the world, ""revolutionary hackers,"" Serdem said, that can help the project realize itself.  ""We know that there are many people with the expertise and with the philosophy. They know very well the current system doesn't work. Globally, it doesn't work,"" Serdem continued.  In part, Taaki's efforts in Europe to attract idealistic young programmers interested in putting ideas of decentralized, societal change into practice are related to this.  According to Serdem, Rojava represents the last opportunity for which such a revolution in possible – to overthrow the old system of globalization, capitalist exploitation and a new form of consumer slavery.  ""Rojava, this is for me, this is the last opportunity for humans,"" Serdem told CoinDesk, concluding:  ""We need to create this as an example. Rojava can be our first step of how we can be captain of our planet which is occupied by the old system.""
