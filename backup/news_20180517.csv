42401558,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd01RN,1526596233,Cornell Professor Unveils 'Simple Yet Powerful' Consensus Protocols,"A pseudonymous team of developers have created a family of new consensus protocols for blockchains.  Cornell University professor and blockchain researcher Emin Gun Sirer announced the new protocols Thursday at Token Summit III in New York, explaining that they combine what he referred to as the ""classical consensus"" and ""Nakamoto consensus"" models in blockchain network decision-making.  “The way this protocol works is incredibly simple yet incredibly powerful,” he said.  Sirer and his team have been working on the white paper for this protocol family for months, he said, but it was developed by a pseudonymous team called “Team Rocket” after the Pokemon characters.  Referred to as Snowflake, Snowball and Avalanche, the protocols randomly sample network participants, and ultimately choose a single result, Sirer said. “They rely on randomness and they rely on random interactions and yet they ensure after the interactions everyone has decided the same thing.”  According to the white paper:  “Inspired by gossip algorithms, this new family gains its safety through a deliberately metastable mechanism. Specifically, the system operates by repeatedly sampling the network at random, and steering the correct nodes towards the same outcome.”  Nakamoto consensus protocols (of which bitcoin is the best known) require miners to agree to a specific decision before it can be enacted, while classical consensus requires a two-thirds plus one majority, Sirer said during his talk.  However, not everyone agrees that this is a novel breakthrough.  Ethereum developer Vlad Zamfir said on Twitter that due to the nature of the protocols, they fail to combine “the best of Nakamoto consensus with the best of classical consensus” as Sirer asserted.  Zamfir, who is the leading researcher behind ethereum's upcoming proof-of-stake protocol Casper CBC, said the new protocols combine ""the worst of both worlds,"" due to aspects of the code that could lead to weakened security.  “It's not asynchronously safe and it's probabilistic,” he said, later adding “We don't get to take a probabilistic model of the network for granted [in my opinion].”  William Mougayar and Emin Gün Sirer image by Nikhilesh De for CoinDesk",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/05/17/cornell-professor-unveils-simple-yet-powerful-consensus-protocols,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ee740c84dac81a71e8b3acfb46d58648c46ad4c0-2560x1244.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Speaking at the Decoding Digital Currency Conference yesterday in San Francisco, Brainard said that, while central bank digital currencies may seem to address a number of challenges associated with cryptocurrencies, they ""may not withstand closer scrutiny.""  Further, with people finding easier ways to exchange digital payments directly through mobile applications and other means, American consumers are likely to receive multiple ways of making electronic payments in real-time.  She noted:  ""Finally, there is no compelling demonstrated need for a Fed-issued digital currency.""  Elsewhere in the speech, Brainard once again made it clear that she believes that cryptocurrencies not pose a threat to financial stability.  She noted that the central bank is actively monitoring developments in cryptocurrencies in areas such as payments policy, supervision and regulation, financial stability, monetary policy and more.  Discussing security concerns with respect to cryptocurrencies, including breaches and fraudulent activities, Brainard said:  ""However, the still relatively small scale of cryptocurrencies in relation to our broader financial system and relatively limited connections to our banking sector suggest that they do not currently pose a threat to financial stability.""  The governor continued to say that adverse developments and shifts in the cryptocurrency market might lead to extreme price fluctuations, trading difficulties or even market breakdowns. In order to prevent such activities, Brainard stressed that Fed Reserve ""will continue to monitor cryptocurrencies as they evolve, with particular vigilance for any signs of growing materiality to the broader financial system.""  As noted, this not the first time the Fed governor has spoken on the subject of cryptocurrencies.

In the regulator's release, New York financial services superintendent Maria Vullo said, ""New York continues to lead the nation in regulating the growing fintech industry.""  But the BitLicense has come in for intense criticism from cryptocurrency entrepreneurs. Speaking at CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 conference Tuesday, ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees called the regulation an ""absolute failure"" that ""should be removed."" He said it was ""pathetic"" that only a handful of firms had received BitLicenses after three years. ""That's the rate of innovation in New York.""  Several exchanges have stopped operating in the state, including ShapeShift and Kraken.  Despite lacking a BitLicense prior to this week, Genesis Trading has been operating in New York under a safe harbor provision.  The market maker caters to high net worth and institutional investors and offers round-the-clock trading in bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether, ethereum classic, XRP, litecoin and zcash.

Paxos holds a limited-purpose trust company charter from DFS, as does Gemini Trust Company, a cryptocurrency exchange.  New York became the first state to craft a regulatory structure specifically for cryptocurrencies in 2014, and finalized the BitLicense in August 2015.  The other four firms to receive the license are Circle, in 2015; XRP II, a Ripple subsidiary that sells XRP, the following year; and Coinbase and bitFlyer in 2017.

42429091,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrdrh,1526564700,Social Network Adopts Civic's Blockchain ID System,"Blockchain identity startup Civic has launched a decentralized verification system – and a social media platform for the crypto community is already moving to adopt it.  Dubbed ""ID Codes,"" the mechanism has been integrated with the website of Hilo, a social network platform for both experienced cryptocurrency traders and ""newbies"" that, when launched, will provide information on crypto tokens and prices.  According to Civic, ID Codes provide users and institutions with an independent way to authenticate their identity for social media profiles, company profiles and more. After users undergo verification by submitting a selfie and scans of their driver's license and passport, the company provides them with a unique link and verified profile that is then encoded on Civic's network.  CEO Vinny Lingham told CoinDesk in an interview that Civic is attempting to resolve what he considers to be the problematic notion that anonymity is a good thing.  ""It's not always needed and not always necessary. And in fact, it's actually dangerous for people because they lose money,"" he said – through giveaway scams, for example.  First conceptualized over a year ago, the development of the verification technology was prompted by the proliferation of fraud and scams in the cryptocurrency industry, particularly with initial coin offerings (ICOs) or token sales.  One common scheme Civic hopes to prevent, in particular, is the false listing of top industry executives as advisors on scam ICO websites – something of which Lingham himself has been a victim.  Community boost  It's this use case, in part, that motivated Hilo to adopt the technology.  ""Why we're excited about Civic ID Codes to start off with is it allows us to authenticate our team members, our investors and our advisors on our website,"" Hilo founder and CEO Monica Puchner told CoinDesk.  She went on to say:  ""As we release to a global community, that's kind of the first level point of contact that people will have with our website. So, being able to authenticate our investors and advisors is very paramount and important for us.""  Although still in beta, Hilo will also use Civic's technology to validate its users' identities. While they will not be required to use the service, users who do not undergo the verification process will be unable to comment on the site and reap any rewards. Puchner estimates that this will mitigate the issues with bots and trolls faced by social platforms like Twitter.  ""We think that having that level of transparency and authenticating users at login is very important to kind of get away from the trolling experience and the bad behavior that is surrounding other sites,"" she said.  Looking ahead  Lingham said Civic plans to fully roll out ID Codes in the third quarter of this year. The technology will be free for users, but businesses will have to pay to use the service.  In the short term, however, the company is giving businesses more than 100,000 tokens raised through its $30 million ICO held in 2017.  ""That subsidizes the cost of operating the network because these tokens effectively pay for whatever they would normally pay out of pocket for,"" Lingham said.  He thinks moving quickly is critical to being successful in the industry, and he has wasted no time finding other partners.

42429087,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrdlh,1526544028,Capital Markets Blockchains Are Finally Getting Go-Live Dates,"If minimum viable products (MVPs) have so far proved elusive for companies building blockchain solutions for capital markets, Consensus 2018 marked a notable change in the narrative.  Assembled in New York this week, a handful were even confident enough to give firm timetables for production. For those tired of blue-sky talk, it was refreshing to hear large-scale financial infrastructure projects discussed openly and frankly, in clear terms of where they are and when we can expect to see things going live.  ""We are now starting to see at Consensus, examples of where financial services are taking this technology into production with real timelines that they have committed to,"" Chris Church, the head of business development at Digital Asset, said.  He told CoinDesk:  ""I think that’s a very important proof point for the industry.""  Indeed, DA, a blockchain startup founded by former JP Morgan executive Blythe Masters, has itself been making headway with its overhaul of the Australian Securities Exchange's (ASX) Clearing House Electronic Sub-register System (CHESS).  Underscoring the seriousness of the undertaking, ASX recently produced an 87-page progress report. Roll-out is targeted for late 2020 or early 2021.  ""A lot of people have talked about hype and reality,"" Church said. But with the ASX's commitment, at the end of last year, to replace CHESS with DA's technology, ""we now have evidence that a systemically consequential, highly regulated, national market infrastructure has made the decision to take this technology to put it into production for their marketplace.""  Church stressed that this project is not simply ""adding something on,"" but rather, taking out a chunk of the CHESS system and replacing it.  Looking ahead, Church said that DA is now working with a bunch of other financial market infrastructure providers, including exchange groups in all three major regions – Europe, North America and Asia/Pacific.  Though he wouldn't name names, Church indicated that these conversations were not about doing more proofs-of-concept.  ""A science experiment is not what we are interested in,"" he said.  In the weeds  But DA isn't the only company that's actually finally getting somewhere with DLT for financial market rails.  For example, the re-platforming of the DTCC's trade information warehouse is one of the highest profile financial infrastructure blockchain projects bitten off by anyone. Robert Palatnick, DTCC's chief technology architect, confirmed that coding is expected to finish at the end of this quarter; what will follow and take until year-end, is a complex process of integration, testing and data migration.  Palatnick told CoinDesk:  ""It’s exciting, but we are currently in the weeds and learning new and interesting things about working with this nascent technology as we progress.""  He went on to explain that changing to a blockchain isn’t a ""magical flip of a switch."" It involves a migration of all the data that is currently in the legacy system into the blockchain before anything can go live.  The enormity of such a project may not be obvious to those unfamiliar with the creaky plumbing of the capital markets.  ""It’s hard to explain how you connect to legacy systems, for example, if you don’t have legacy systems,"" Palatnick said. ""We don’t have any benchmarks to compare to when it comes to blockchain, so while this is unchartered territory, we continue to be pleased with our progress.""  In the third quarter of this year, DTCC expects user acceptance and the migration process to start in earnest, with an expectation of going live in next year's first quarter.  ""We are comfortable we can meet that schedule,"" said Palatnick.  Drilling down a little, the very first phase involves running the ledger nodes inside of DTCC's environment. So firms will not be running nodes themselves in the first instance until the whole challenge of managing those nodes is understood.  At the completion of phase one, DTCC will have nodes set up internally for every firm that it knows will run one, plus some general nodes that will take care of supporting the transactions and processing for the firms that do not wish to support a node of their own.  For this project, DTCC has taken a multi-vendor approach. Ethereum-inspired startup Axoni is providing the technology, with IBM helping to manage the project, and R3 providing best practice guidance on areas like selecting the right data models.  'Changing a whole industry'  Meanwhile, in Europe, a blockchain project involving the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and a growing contingent of buy-side firms is now scheduled to go live in January 2019. Professional services firm KPMG picked the clearing and settlement of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the Luxembourg exchange as a use case for blockchain – which, it turns out, is a very big deal.  Luxembourg is the largest fund management hub outside of the U.S. The jurisdiction holds many trillions of dollars worth of assets under management.  ""This is not just about changing the Luxembourg exchange – it's about changing a whole industry,"" Eamonn Maguire, a managing director in charge of advisory banking services at KPMG, told CoinDesk. ""The primary netting point, if you will, for funds trading in Europe is Luxembourg.""  Explaining the impetus for such a change, Maguire pointed out that the charging of commissions for the distribution of funds is going to end under the European Union's second Markets in Financial Infrastructure Directive (MiFID II). The hit to revenue means costs must be cut somewhere.  As part of its response, Luxembourg is embracing a newer ""fintech"" approach using apps and mobile devices for direct-to-consumer distribution.  But combining this front-end revamp with blockchains in the back office will mean a roughly 60% reduction in costs for the exchange, said Maguire.  The KPMG-led project includes banks like BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole and others, as well as over 400 asset managers. The technology used is ethereum-based Quorum, the popular open-source project run by JP Morgan.  KPMG found that Quorum in this private deployment was achieving a throughput of 800 transactions per second, and that would need to be ramped up for production, especially considering Luxembourg's direct-to-consumer funds-picking model.  Maguire is proud of the magnitude of the project, which started out as a kind of garage idea inside KPMG. He concluded:  ""There are different strategies.

42429085,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrdZh,1526529622,"Axoni, Clearmatics Claim Milestone for Blockchain Interoperability","Two of the most prominent startups in enterprise blockchain are teaming up to tackle the hard, but now seemingly inescapable problem of interoperability.  At Consensus 2018 this week, Clearmatics and Axoni demonstrated how a financial derivative can be issued via a smart contract, trigger a payment and then instigate a cross-chain atomic transfer of value between two distinct networks. This marked the first time a derivatives contract has been originated on one enterprise blockchain and settled on another.  The milestone is important because interoperability is now emerging as a key design goal of distributed ledger technology (DLT).  While the financial world may be moving from a state of many ledgers to fewer ones, blockchain architects have come to realize that trades, deals and transactions will probably never be originated, processed and settled by a single, monolithic system.  Robert Sams, the CEO of Clearmatics, told CoinDesk:  “Facilitating end-to-end processing from point of trade to settlement, we need to make the assumption that that process is going travel through multiple systems, rather than a single monolithic settlement system, distributed or otherwise.""  The collaboration is significant also because of the clout of the players involved.  Axoni, based in New York, is working with a wide range of leading financial institutions and infrastructure providers to move trillions of notional value in U.S. dollars onto blockchain tech across a variety of asset classes.  Meanwhile, its partner in the demo, Clearmatics of London, is working with a consortium of banks and financial institutions to create digital fiat that is fully collateralized by cash at the corresponding central bank and transferable on a distributed ledger.  Axoni has also been doing a lot of work in the derivatives space and other areas of post-trade processes, while Clearmatics is focused on the settlement side of things, so the pairing was an obvious fit (both are building technology based on ethereum-derived architecture).  ""If we can collaborate appropriately and facilitate linkage between those networks, what you end up with is a highly automated, highly transparent process all the way from trade agreement through to settlement finality,"" said Greg Schvey, the CEO of Axoni.  Lessons from crypto  Stepping back, it's fair to say blockchain interoperability is at the R&D stage.  To make sense of the problem involves a lot of requirements based on use cases and the domain applications, which all have to be considered together. Sams emphasized that the interoperability demo was just a proof of concept – but an important one, because it drives the spirit of open source collaboration.  “Interoperability needs to be tackled in a open and collaborative fashion and built around open standards and open source implementations,” he said, adding:  “There will probably be multiple types of interoperability solutions – not many, but more than one.”  The same spirit extends to the public blockchain community, where a lot of cutting-edge work is being done on the very technical aspects of the topic.  “There's a lot of overlap between cross-chain atomic swaps in the cryptocurrency space and the stuff that we are doing,” said Sams. “Even though the domain application is entirely different, the underlying technological primitives are very similar.”  The contract in question was modeled using Axoni’s domain-specific language, AxLang, and then settlement finality of the resulting cash payments was achieved across different permissioned, ethereum-compatible ledgers.  Clearmatics' contribution to the demo was Ion, an open source interoperability protocol, designed to perform atomic cross-chain transactions.  Lingua franca  The AxLang smart programing language used here was developed by Axoni to make working with smart contracts in an enterprise setting a sure thing, so to speak.  Axlang is based on Scala and enables formal verification of smart contracts, a rigorous mathematical method used to prove the correctness of computer programs. It can also compile to both the Java and the ethereum virtual machines.  However, developers are often asked, why another programing language?  Schvey said that doing lots of work with large-scale application design on blockchains revealed certain requirements not being met by Solidity, the first step into programming smart contracts among the ethereum community.  In particular, Solidity lacks formal verification, which is the ability to have mathematical proofs that the code written has compiled properly, Schvey said.  “Being able to check for certain error vectors is a very powerful concept, especially if you are deploying a large scale multi-party infrastructure with a lot of value going through it,” he said.  Indeed, the proof of concept marries two hard technical challenges: interoperability and formal verification. And there’s an important connection between the two, Sams pointed out.  “Imagine an end state of distributed market infrastructure where you have an end-to-end process flow, occurring through multiple systems,"" he said.  “It's obviously going to be very important that at the semantic layer, a system taking over a process from another system, and vice versa, understands and can demonstrate exactly what the business logic is that they are consuming or producing for another system to consume.”  Two roads image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/05/17/axoni-clearmatics-claim-milestone-for-blockchain-interoperability,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd9d3038d847eb09dae5bcc9462635faa3562448-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
