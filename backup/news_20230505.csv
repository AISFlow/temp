The now popular PEPE meme token based on Ethereum was originally inspired by the Bitcoin BRC-20 PEPE which launched earlier in March, 2023. PEPE’s exponential price growth in its barely first month recorded close to 38,900% ROI for early investors. This has led to crypto enthusiasts and developers to explore the original BRC-20 token standard version with which the first PEPE was created on. The BRC-20 is a new and unique token standard that has recently gained massive popularity and exposure due to the successes of the Ethereum based PEPE. Related Reading: Pepe Shakes Off CZ’s Controversial Views On Meme Coins, Shoots Up 709% A Dive Into The BRC-20 Token Standard The BRC-20 token standard is an experimental mechanism to launch a token based on the Bitcoin blockchain network. This new token standard was created by a pseudonymous on-chain analyst called Domo. Domo created the BRC-20 token standard in March 2023 to facilitate transfers of fungible tokens across the Bitcoin network. This new experimental standard would also enable developers and programmers to create and send fungible tokens, including memecoins, via the Bitcoin ordinals protocol. While several token standards are present in the blockchain industry, the BRC-20 was modeled after the popular Ethereum ERC-20 standard, although there are some fundamental differences. The ERC-20 standard which requires using smart contracts to launch a token is quite different from the BRC-20. The latter simply requires a Bitcoin wallet to mint and create tokens without using smart contracts. Related Reading: SUI Gets A Bear Introduction On Day 2, Will Sell Pressure Continue? PEPE Sets A Precedence For Newer Memecoins Recently, there has been a frenzy of newer memecoins launching into the crypto market using the BRC-20 token standard due to its popularity. According to data reports from Coinmarketcap, 8,500 tokens, including memecoins, have been minted and launched using this standard. This has resulted in a massive surge in the BRC-20 token market capitalization and transaction volume which were reported to outperform Bitcoin by over 50% between April 29 and May 2, 2023. We can see that in the last 10 days number of BRC20 tx has largely surpassed that of ordinals. They might even soon overload the bitcoin network and cause issues. pic.twitter.com/FSGzkfeTJT — Crypto Koryo (@CryptoKoryo) May 2, 2023 The increasing transaction volumes and market capitalization of BRC-20, have drawn the interests of many investors who explore a variety of tokens created using this new token standard. However, it is important to note that the BRC-20 standard is still in its experimental phase, and as such, caution should be exerted when exploring tokens based on it.

The Ethreum Classic network activity is still very minimal. Given the large concentration of ownership by related parties, I'd personally avoid trying to arb trade this one. I've covered Grayscale's Ethereum Classic Trust ( ETCG ) a couple times in the past and most recently in early March. My general feel on ETCG is that until there is meaningful activity growth on the Ethereum Classic ( ETC-USD ) blockchain, it's probably best to avoid playing the enormous NAV arbitrage that is evident by the current 62% discount to the fund's underlying ETC holdings. I won't beat a dead horse in this article, but I will explore some possible outcomes based on news that Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert recently sold a portion of his ETCG holdings. Related Party Sales In a recent filing with the SEC, Barry Silbert disclosed the selling of 119,320 shares of ETCG. At the time of those sales, the market value of the distribution was a little over $755k. This is newsworthy because Silbert is the CEO of Grayscale parent company Digital Currency Group. Silbert is also a Director for the Ethereum Classic Trust and a 10% holder in the trust shares. The liquidated ETCG shares represent a little less than 1% of the 13,993,800 shares outstanding. In addition to these sales, Grayscale also released its latest 10-Q for the trust Friday morning. The company disclosed a reduction in related party holdings from 3,258,770 shares at the end of December down to 3,122,214 shares at the end of March. Because that period pre-dates the disclosed Silbert distribution, I believe we can reasonably assume that related party holdings is actually now down to 3,002,894. That's a year to date reduction in holdings of almost 8%. Interestingly, ETCG isn't actually the only Grayscale fund that is experiencing related party sales. Grayscale released updated 10-Qs for all eight of the company's single asset trusts Friday morning. It's actually Grayscale's Ethereum Trust ( OTCQX:ETHE ) that has seen the largest reduction in related party holdings going back to the previous filings: Grayscale Trusts Last reporting period Current reporting period Change Bitcoin (GBTC) 36,065,470 36,066,527 0.00% ETHE 11,811,797 8,728,797 -26.10% ETCG 3,258,770 3,122,214 -4.19% Horizen ( OTCQX:HZEN ) 3,643,924 3,614,804 -0.80% Litecoin ( OTCQX:LTCN ) 1,296,956 1,126,498 -13.14% Stellar ( OTCQX:GXLM ) 118,192 118,589 0.34% Zcash ( OTCQX:ZCSH ) 875,407 875,407 0.00% Bitcoin Cash ( OTCQX:BCHG ) 1,786,273 1,443,441 -19.19% Source: Grayscale I think there are a few ways to look at this. With the exception of the Bitcoin (BTC-USD) trust, the majority of the remaining funds that were largely untouched are much smaller and far more illiquid: Grayscale Trusts AUM Related Party Owns Ownership Change GBTC $18,141,053,264 5.21% 0.00% ETHE $5,652,509,179 2.81% -26.10% ETCG $225,779,407 22.31% -4.19% LTCN $132,775,270 6.55% -13.14% BCHG $35,797,465 4.15% -19.19% ZCSH $11,926,286 23.17% 0.00% GXLM $6,889,168 14.38% 0.34% HZEN $5,805,837 52.86% -0.80% Source: Grayscale Furthermore, related parties own a much smaller proportion of the shares outstanding in the funds that were sold the most, possibly indicating that those funds have a more robust bid in the open market. Again, GBTC was an outlier here and I imagine it's because of the lawsuit with the SEC. Pertaining to the ETCG shares, related parties own such a large percentage of the shares outstanding that it's likely very difficult to distribute a larger percentage of those holdings without completely nuking the NAV discount further. Data by YCharts While most of those funds trade between 25% and 50% discounts, ETCG is bringing up the rear at 62%. My view is that discount has more to do with the ownership concentration than the Ethereum Classic network itself. But even considering that, the activity level on-chain doesn't justify longing ETCG for the arb. Ethereum Classic Still Lacks Activity Growth I'll reiterate that I have no interest in beating a dead horse in this article. So to quickly provide some context on the level of activity happening on the Ethereum Classic blockchain, nothing has meaningfully changed since my last article in March: ETC Mean Hash Rate (CoinMetrics) Mean hash rate is still at higher levels from August but down about 50% of the post ""Merge"" high. ETC DAUs (CoinMetrics) Additionally, daily active addresses just made a new two year low of 16.9k on April 29th. Summary There are multiple ways to look at ETCG. On one hand, it's a simple bet on the network utility and adoption of Ethereum Classic. I don't personally view that as a good bet today. The other way to look at ETCG is as an arbitrage on liquidation value. Meaning, if Grayscale ultimately moves to liquidate the fund entirely and distribute the proceeds to ETCG holders, ETCG gets very attractive as the cash return on that distribution would be much higher than the market value of the shares presently. Of course, that's provided there is market demand for Grayscale's ETC sales. Likewise, if Grayscale wins its SEC case and can begin transitioning additional funds to ETFs, a redemption mechanism should be able to close the NAV discount in these funds as well. But if that were a likely possibility, it is doubtful in my view that Barry Silbert and other related parties would be selling shares at a 62% discount unless they are desperate for cash - which is certainly a possibility. As I said in my last article, I can empathize with the ""code is law"" mentality of ETC supporters. But without an increase in organic demand for ETC, I don't think the story is there for ETCG arb plays. Given how much ETCG is owned by related parties and the apparent motivation from those parties to sell, I'd probably cut out of ETCG if I was holding it.",NEUTRAL,BCH | ETC,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | ETC | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4600746-ethereum-classic-trust-ownership-concentration-problem?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12380366.jpeg

The Fed raised its benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points, as expected, and softened its stance slightly to signal that the central bank isn't necessarily expecting further firming. However, the latest jobs report could pressure the Fed to consider an additional rate hike, or at least maintain elevated rates for longer.

The announcement, made in a court filing on Friday, comes 10 days after Binance US abruptly pulled out of a $1 billion deal to purchase Voyager Digital’s assets following a U.S. government intervention to block part of it. Before the deal with Binance US, the crypto had a deal to sell itself to FTX – a transaction that fell apart when FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in November.  According to the filing, Voyager’s customers will receive an initial recovery of 36% of their crypto holdings – an abysmally low recovery rate compared to both estimates of their recovery rate of 72-73% if either of the acquisition plans were successful, as well as recovery estimates for creditors of other bankrupt crypto platforms. Celsius’ creditors, for example, will receive an estimated 70% of their holdings.  The recovery rate could rise, according to the filing, if defunct crypto trading firm Alameda Research’s attempt to claw back $446 million from Voyager’s estate fails. In addition to reserving $446 million of the estate’s holdings for the Alameda suit, Voyager’s lawyers are also withholding an additional $259.6 million for litigation costs, administrative claims and assorted other “holdbacks.”  Creditors who have any of the 67 “supported” tokens, including bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), stuck on the platform will be able to withdraw the allowable percent of their crypto directly. For those with any of the 38 “unsupported tokens,” including Solana's SOL and Algorand's ALGO, Voyager will liquidate everything and pay customers back with USD coin (USDC), a stablecoin.

Its success is partly due to its captivating name and adorable mascot, which has been a hit with social media users. However, beyond the hype, how does SHIB compare to other meme coins such as PEPE and DOGE? PEPE is the newly hyped memecoin in the crypto market. With the token doing over 20x since its creation, it has attracted many traders and investors. Dogecoin (DOGE), on the other hand, is known as Elon Musk’s favorite. Related Reading: BREAKING: Binance Lists PEPE And FLOKI In Innovation Zone SHIB, PEPE, And DOGE: The Comparison On May 5, Coingecko released a study that analyzed the price returns of meme coins over a period, utilizing data from CoinGecko. The study considered the start of data availability as the hypothetical date of purchase, while the all-time high price, as of May 4, 2023, was taken as the selling point to achieve profits. According to the data from Coingecko, SHIB required an initial investment of just $12 to reach $1M in 2021, making it one of the most affordable meme coins in the market. In contrast, DOGE required an initial investment of $820 in 2013, which is significantly higher. Other meme coins, such as PEPE and WOJAK, require an initial investment of $158,312 and $175,330, respectively, making them far less accessible to the average investor in 2023. Regarding price gains, SHIB was the most successful meme coin, with an incredible 8,424,202.3% increase at its peak compared to its starting price on August 1, 2020. This is a testament to the popularity of SHIB and its ability to attract investors worldwide. On the other hand, DOGE has been a successful meme coin over the long run, having been a pioneer in the category since 2013. DOGE’s price performance has been impressive and consistently in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu has struggled to reach the top 10 while still ranking 16th in the global crypto market. Related Reading: Is It Too Late To Buy Shiba Inu (SHIB)?

At the time of writing, SHIB trades at $0.00001000, representing an 88.43% decline from its all-time high. SHIB’s market capitalization has gradually plummeted in the past 7 days, moving from a high of $6.1 billion on April 29 to as low as $5.8 billion.

Look at the stock market,"Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) is ending the week on a strong note, flirting with the key $2K technical level, as investors' risk appetite increased alongside a rebound in regional bank stocks. The world's largest altcoin by market cap ( ETH-USD ) drove up 6.1% to $1.99K as of shortly before 5:00 p.m. ET and is on track to end the week 4.9% higher. By comparison, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) advanced 2.3% to $29.54K, hovering just below the closely-watched $30K resistance level. The swings were accompanied by a strong rally in U.S. equities , with all three major indices each jumping at least 1.5%, even as April's nonfarm payrolls report came in hotter than expected. Also, beaten-down regional bank stocks rebounded off their lows after slumping the first four days of the week on fears over the health of the sector. Despite uncertainty surrounding regional banks and rising interest rates, the labor market is still tight and might pressure the Federal Reserve to ratchet up rates once more, a move that could bode poorly for cryptos and other riskier assets. All eyes will be on April's CPI report, due out next week, to gauge whether core inflation continued to be stubbornly high. The overall crypto market value perked up 2.7% to $1.22T, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

12377963,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=530147,1683318612,"Bitcoin Breaks Out: Experts Predict $36,000 Target As Market Outlook Remains Positive","Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency, could be set for a significant price surge in the coming weeks, according to experts at Matrixport, a leading provider of cryptocurrency financial services. The company has projected a target of $36,000 for Bitcoin, based on a technical breakout that signals a strong rally amidst a positive market outlook fueled by stock buybacks and meme coins. Related Reading: 4 Reasons To Be Bullish On Bitcoin In Short-And Mid-Term Bitcoin Set To Soar With Strong Technical Breakout And Meme Coin Frenzy Matrixport’s analysis shows that Bitcoin is currently trading within a narrowing triangle formation, which is about to break to the upside. This could potentially project a move higher by around 6,100 points, which would bring the price of Bitcoin to the projected target of $36,000. The positive market outlook for Bitcoin is driven in part by the popularity of meme coins, which have seen a surge in interest among retail investors. Additionally, stock buybacks by major corporations have provided a boost to the broader market, which has spilled over into the cryptocurrency space. Furthermore, according to Matrixport, Bitcoin could see a significant price increase of up to 20% from current levels. This would set a target of $35,000 to $36,000 for Bitcoin, driven by a potential breakout in the market. Matrixport’s analysis shows that a breakout could be imminent for Bitcoin, which could lead to significant gains for the cryptocurrency. Additionally, the recent 25 basis point interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve may be the last for this cycle, potentially setting up the market for another strong rally. Moreover, Despite a recent decline in trading volume, Matrixport notes that the path higher for Bitcoin sees only limited resistance, with transactions on the network reaching new all-time highs and the number of active addresses remaining strong. Another interesting trend highlighted by Matrixport is the increasing popularity of meme coins such as DinoLFG, Pepe, Wojak, ChadCoin, and IgnoreFud. While these meme coins may be small, their trading activity is worth noting as it signals a shift in market sentiment towards a more positive outlook. BTC’s MVRV Ratio Breaks Key Threshold, Signaling Bull Run Ahead According to a recent analysis by CryptoQuant’s researcher, “Onchained”, In January 2023, Bitcoin’s market-value-to-realized-value (MVRV) ratio broke the 1 level in an upward direction, indicating a substantial increase in its price due to significant accumulation in both the spot and derivatives markets. The MVRV ratio has revealed that the 1.5 level is of significant importance, serving as a crucial threshold for Bitcoin to enter its bull run. Currently, Bitcoin’s MVRV has been fluctuating between 1.55 and 1.45 this month, with large investors closely monitoring the indicator to capitalize on Bitcoin dips and accumulate discounted BTC to fill their bags. Furthermore, According to Onchained’s analysis, the MVRV ratio experiences a trend change when it breaks its 365-day simple moving average (365DSMA). If the ratio breaks this moving average in an upward trend, it signifies the start of a bull market, with the MVRV ratio changing direction to reach high levels typically between 2 to 3.75 or more. Conversely, if the MVRV ratio breaks the 365DSMA in a downward trend, it signals the start of a bear market, with the ratio changing direction to reach low values of 1 or less. These patterns are visible in the chart. Onchained’s analysis has revealed that when the MVRV ratio breaks the 1.5 level, the 365DSMA becomes flattened before changing direction upward. Currently, it appears that BTC is experiencing this trend, as its MVRV ratio fluctuates in the range of 1.5 values. If Bitcoin breaks the $30,000 level, a rapid change in its MVRV ratio is expected, which is likely to shift to a range of values between 1.8 and 2.

The statement served to justify Aragon’s exile of at least half a dozen community members for “spamming” Aragon’s Discord server with questions over its finances.  The response escalated a brewing fight between Aragon and a cadre of activist investors who have taken interest in the project’s ANT token and multimillion-dollar treasury. But the nature of Aragon’s response also raised thorny questions over proper implementation of crypto governance itself, the subject at the center of the Aragon project.  A DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, is a method of governance in which crypto investors vote to decide how a project is run. Aragon builds tools to help other DAOs operate and is itself partially governed by a DAO. This week it began moving its treasury toward community control, an effort nearly a year in the making.  While governance decisions over those riches will happen via votes on the blockchain, it is on Discord and project governance forums that members of Aragon’s community – like those at nearly every other DAO – organize their thoughts and coordinate action.  On Wednesday Aragon insiders booted people whose speech was deemed detrimental to the community. Many – but not all – of the members it exiled are aligned with crypto’s underground activist investor movement, the RFV raiders, who have taken an interest in Aragon. In its Friday blog post, Aragon declared it would stand firm against them.  “The AA will continue to carefully and empirically pace our decentralization to ensure that individuals and groups cannot use ANT for personal profit at the expense of building the technology which ANT is intended to govern,” the Aragon Association said.  The Aragon Association gave no timeline for future efforts to move its treasury to community control. This week’s governance debacle had concluded with the mass banning and an announcement that Aragon had moved $300,000 of a nearly $70 million treasury to a wallet that the DAO will ultimately operate.  It also gave no timeline for reinstating the banned members to Discord, some of whom told CoinDesk they were also booted from Aragon’s governance forum.

In 2019, Russian authorities froze over 100 bank accounts related to the opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Though the authorities stated that the action aligned with a money laundering investigation, many citizens believed it was politically inclined. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin And Crypto Up Today? Last year, Canada froze over 200 accounts of people and firms connected to the protests in Ottawa against Covid-19 mandates. According to the reports, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) froze several financial products, which included bank and corporate accounts. Also, it froze a payment processing account with a valuation of about $3.8 million. After citing these instances, the environmental lawyer stated that financial censorship is gradually creeping into the United States. This means a person’s account could be frozen due to his comments on social media or political stance.

Notably, the suspension was through the command of the US State Department. DoJ Kennedy Jr On Bitcoin And CBDCs The central banks of countries manage Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). This means that the government will control the financial accounts of all residents in a country that runs CBDC. Kenndy Jr believes CBDCs could magnify a government’s power to suppress meaningful political dissent. The authorities could decide to cut the financial access of some individuals just because of political statements and opinions. Related Reading: Bitcoin On-Chain Transactions Reach New Heights, What’s Fueling the Surge? The lawyer noted that a meaningful dissent should include people’s ability to save and use their finances without political interference. It should be about maintaining the proper political protection from powerful personal interests regarding democracy. But citizens’ meaningful dissent is at risk with the adoption of CBDCs and their power to the government. As such, Kennedy Jr supported Bitcoin, stating that the crypto asset would allow anyone to operate financially without government interference. In his words, Bitcoin is a lifesaver that enables people’s free global movement and actions.

In a tweet, John Deaton claims the SEC undermined its once credible case by quoting an unrelated legal document. Deaton believes the document, dubbed ECF 640, supported his claim when the SEC stated that the XRP purchase was an investment in a “common enterprise.” “The quoted legal document supports [what I said] by stating that even if some country recognizes XRP as fiat currency in the future, it would still be considered a security.” If El Salvador 🇸🇻 recognized XRP as legal tender, like #BTC – the SEC claims it still a security. 🤦‍♂️ https://t.co/fI1Ofn23iN — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) May 5, 2023 According to Deaton, the SEC will still regard XRP as a security even if other countries recognize it as a legal tender. SEC’s XRP Theory Is Indefinable In Time And Space, Says Deaton Deaton argued that the SEC cannot boycott the Howey test by alleging that every XRP sale (before, now, and future) meets all the test’s prongs. He noted that no underlying asset in an investment contract was ever tagged security since the Howey test started 76 years ago. Related Reading: Bitcoin On-Chain Transactions Reach New Heights, What’s Fueling the Surge? The legal expert further explained that no investment contract exists without a legal relationship between the buyer and promoter. Deaton’s tweets suggest the SEC’s argument is absurd and lacks credibility. Deaton cited his Amici motion to the federal judge presiding over the Ripple case, Judge Torres. He addressed the SEC’s argument as a shorthand and analytically lazy contention, slamming the agency for tagging every XRP sale, from its ICO to the present, financial security. In the lawyer’s opinion, the scope of the SEC’s arguments is overstretched and indefinable in time and space. Community’s Responses to Deaton’s Argument Deaton’s tweets attracted other crypto proponents. While responding, a Twitter user @Kashta9 said he thinks the SEC’s position in the lawsuit is that all XRP sales, including those in the secondary market, are investment contracts. Other respondents said they don’t care about anybody’s opinion but the judge’s. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin And Crypto Up Today? Deaton ended his argument by expressing his confidence in Judge Torres’ ability to recognize and act according to the massive public interest in the XRP lawsuit. The Ripple lawsuit is among the most viral topics in the crypto industry, with many anticipating a ruling in Q2 2023. A total of 75,000 XRP holders from the United States and 143 countries joined the Ripple lawsuit. However, no one can predict if it will become security until the judge pronounces judgment.

A perfect example: a pseudonymous trader named dimethyltryptamine.eth spent $263 just three weeks ago to buy trillions of PEPE tokens. That former pittance has turned into $3.8 million in profits from tokens they’ve already sold, and their remaining holdings are worth about $9 million, according to data by blockchain research firm Arkham Intelligence. That’s an almost 5,000,000% profit.  The trader is benefitting from the breakneck rally of a coin based on the “pepe the frog” meme, a popular symbol in crypto circles. Launched in April, the meme coin’s market capitalization astonishingly surpassed $1 billion on Friday and, according to CoinGecko, at one point was worth more than Arbitrum’s ARB, which is also among the hottest newly issued tokens of 2023.  Analysts, however, have raised concerns about the concentrated ownership of pepecoin, pointing to a handful of traders acquiring substantial amounts of PEPE when the token was released last month. Blockchain sleuth Lookonchain unveiled five accounts connected to a wallet belonging to pepecexwallet.eth, which received funds directly from the token’s deployer contract, acquired over 8.87 trillion PEPE after issuance for just $385.  Dimethyltryptamine.eth, which wasn’t cited among the insider wallets by Lookonchain but belongs among the earliest buyers, purchased 5.907 trillion of PEPE tokens for $263 in two transactions on April 14 using UniSwap, Arkham shows. The trader also paid $17 for gas fees.  Since then, the trader has been gradually taking profits by sending smaller amounts multiple times a day to UniSwap, and receiving ether (ETH) in exchange. The wallet has sent $3.8 million of PEPE to UniSwap in the past month, per Arkham data, presumably to take profits, with $2.4 million of that transferred in the past 24 hours.

42420531,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqCvV,1683310685,NFT Lending Platform Blend Sparks Concerns Over Ecosystem Liquidity,"Pro-focused non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Blur is making headlines again, this time for entering the NFT lending space. The move has raised questions about its broader market impact.  On Monday, Blur launched Blend, a peer-to-peer NFT lending platform that allows traders to lease out their NFTs to collectors looking to buy blue-chip NFTs with a smaller upfront payment. Holders hoping to earn extra money can put up their NFT, receive loan offers and then transfer their token via an escrow smart contract to the renter for a specified period of time – similar to a digital pawn shop.  According to Blur, Blend aims to help introduce new buyers to its ecosystem by lowering fiscal barriers to entry for popular NFT collections. As a result, it helps drive liquidity into the greater NFT ecosystem by increasing the amount of traders and transactions.  It’s possible that Blend has contributed to a short-term rise in the floor prices of some blue-chip NFT collections, according to data from NFT marketplace OpenSea. Since May 1, when Blend launched, the floor price of the popular Bored Ape Yacht Club collection has increased from 47 ETH (about $93,500) to about 50 ETH ($99,400). As for its Mutant Ape Yacht Club, the floor price increased from about 10.5 ETH ($20,900) to 11 ETH ($21,900).  Although it appears that Blend may be helping nudge NFT markets upward, it may not be a product that every amateur trader should be eager to “ape” into. The danger is that NFT lending platforms such as Blur allow collectors to purchase tokens with funds they don’t have, creating liquidity risks down the line when collection floors or cryptocurrency prices crumble.  Twitter user Carl_m101, founder of NFT collection Sky Scooters, shared a thread explaining some of the risks of Blend, where after a large price floor jump, a “margin call” event might follow where traders sell off their NFTs and, as a result, end up tanking the market.  “While systems like these are of course basic knowledge to experienced traders, they are new to most NFT traders who can now all of a sudden afford to buy that shiny profile picture (PFP) they have been dreaming of,” said Carl. “We will have many unexperienced buyers fomo-ing into projects they couldn’t afford before or taking loans on their PFPs to buy more.”  While other platforms in the NFT space offer lending, the concern with Blend is that it’s a product directly from Blur, one of the leading NFT marketplaces in terms of trading volume, according to data from Dune analytics. Considering its market share, its already-eager users may be more likely to opt into leasing NFTs rather than purchasing tokens at their full price.  Not only might it hurt the market, but it also may hurt the native BLUR token. Pseudonymous Twitter user Bamboo, strategic lead at NFT trader’s club Invite Only Lounge, said in a Twitter thread that as the NFT market becomes impacted by lenders on Blend, it will hurt people’s BLUR holdings as well as negatively impact the greater crypto ecosystem.  “Blur is employing game theory with its tokenomics and unique airdrop distribution mechanics,” said Bamboo. “But as game theory experts, they must remember – increasing players' winnings at others' expense is not Pareto optimal.”  The NFT lender’s point of view  While Blur is one of the first major NFT marketplaces to roll out its own in-house lending platform, it certainly isn’t the first to introduce the concept of pawning NFTs.  PirateCode and Cryptobiosis, the pseudonymous co-founders of peer-to-peer NFT lending platform BendDAO, told CoinDesk that while NFT lending is generally beneficial for the market and can help bolster liquidity, some of Blend’s financing strategies spark concerns over whether or not its “refinancing” process will actually keep lenders safe.  One issue they called out was the mechanism by which lenders can exit their positions. To do so, they would trigger a Dutch auction to find a new lender and refinance.  “The viability of the refinancing process introduced by Blend remains uncertain,” said PirateCode and Cryptobiosos. “In practice, refinancing becomes relevant only when the number of lenders exceeds that of borrowers.”  Another point of concern regarding Blend is the process of taking out loans to purchase NFTs on the platform.  Jonathan Gabler, co-founder of peer-to-peer NFT lending platform NFTFi, told CoinDesk that while Blend’s initiative to help introduce liquidity into the market is innovative, it’s also dangerous to incentivize traders to take out loans at loan-to-value (LTV) which is troublesome for highly volatile digital assets.  “Unchanged, the current incentive design will likely lead to bad outcomes for borrowers such as mass defaults or liquidations of high-risk loans, flush NFTs into the hands of point farmers, and in consequence, may lead to much higher market volatility,” said Gabler. “Existing peer-to-peer protocols tend to be more borrower-friendly and lead to healthier loan markets.”  Read More: What Is NFT Lending?",NEUTRAL,ETH | BLUR,ETH | MARKET | TRADING | BLUR | AIRDROP,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/05/05/nft-lending-platform-blend-sparks-concerns-over-ecosystem-liquidity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3aeb619a58728a4ed2c4b71aea25925adebcb01e-1248x615.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

12375066,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=530109,1683308408,Coinbase Q1 Report: Net Revenue Skyrockets 22% Quarter-Over-Quarter,"Coinbase, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has reported impressive results for the first quarter of 2023. The company’s efforts toward building a more efficient and financially disciplined business have started to pay off. Despite a net loss of $79 million, Coinbase returned to positive Adjusted EBITDA, earnings before interests, taxes, and amortization, of $284 million, indicating a significant improvement in its financial metrics. According to Coinbase’s first quarter report, the company reduced costs and doubled down on operational excellence and risk management. These efforts resulted in a 22% Q/Q growth in net revenue and a 24% Q/Q decline in operating expenses. Coinbase Posts Strong Q1 Performance Coinbase announced a shift in focus in its latest quarterly report. The report showed that the company was no longer leading with messaging around SAAS, a cloud-based product that can be used directly by the users from their web browser via Coinbase One, as it did in the previous quarter. Related Reading: BREAKING: Binance Lists PEPE And FLOKI In Innovation Zone According to Ram Ahluwalia, the CEO of Lumida Wealth, the shift in focus is due to several factors. One of the main reasons is that Coinbase received feedback from customers indicating that they wanted the company to focus more on its core business of cryptocurrency trading and investing rather than expanding into other areas like SAAS. Additionally, the company recognized that there is a long road ahead for SAAS recurring revenue and that it may take some time to see significant results in this area. Despite this, Coinbase’s latest quarterly report showed that the company’s recurring revenue is still strong. However, a significant portion of this revenue comes from USDC interest income, which has been a primary driver of Coinbase’s success over the past year. Ahluwalia acknowledged that the company is aware of the risks associated with relying heavily on interest income and is actively working to diversify its revenue streams. According to Ahluwalia, the company’s interest income has grown rapidly in recent quarters, reaching $240 million in the first quarter of 2023. While loans grew by 20% quarter-over-quarter, indicating a strong appetite for loan products among Coinbase’s customers. Another interesting trend highlighted in the report is the fact that altcoins accounted for 45% of volume, indicating that Coinbase benefitted from a flight to safety as investors sought out more established cryptocurrencies. Also, assets on the platform grew by a massive 62% QoQ to $130 billion, a figure that is typically seen over a year rather than in a single quarter. Resilience In The Face Of Turmoil Coinbase revealed the rules governing the financial system are “outdated”, and the technology used to support it has been slow to catch up. This has resulted in a system that is “inefficient, costly, and often inaccessible” to large segments of the population. To address these issues, Coinbase is calling for a fundamental rethinking of the financial system. The company believes that blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies can play a key role in creating a more open, transparent, and efficient financial system that can serve the needs of everyone. Furthermore, Coinbase has been making strategic moves to position itself for growth and expansion in the cryptocurrency market. According to Ahluwalia, the company has over $5 billion in capital and liquidity, which is expected to strengthen the bid on Coinbase’s bond.

But after rallying over 20,000x since its launch three weeks ago, what could be driving this fresh rally for the meme coin? Gemini Listing Rumors Spurs New Growth On Thursday, Tyler Winklevoss, one of the co-founders of the Gemini exchange, tweeted a frog emoji that spurred listing rumors in the PEPE community.

Related Reading: Pro-XRP Attorney Shares Information That Could Be Bullish For Ripple Following the tweets, rumors quickly spread that the exchange may be planning to list the meme coin which has been pulling in significant volume since its launch. The rumors were further fueled by the PEPE team moving its treasury holdings to a multi-sig wallet. The reason for this is that larger exchanges oftentimes require team treasury funds to be secured before they are listed. So speculations rose quickly about a possible listing and the Winklevoss tweet has the community convinced that the Gemini listing is coming next. over the next hour you will see some transactions taking place from $PEPE pepecexwallet.eth. a multi-sig is being created and the cex-wallet tokens will be transferred to the safe. pic.twitter.com/anh6VGxjeN — Pepe (@pepecoineth) May 4, 2023 PEPE Rises 100% In One Day At this point, it is no longer a surprise when PEPE moves so quickly.

Data from on-chain aggregator CoinGecko shows that PEPE’s price moved from a price of $0.00000114 which it opened the day with to a new all-time high of $0.00000310. This brought its market cap to a peak of $1.1 billion.

Its 24-hour trading volume of $800 million is also significantly higher than that of its largest competitors, including Dogecoin at $253 million and Shiba Inu at $94 million.

Revenue for the quarter of $773 million topped estimates of $655 million and was up 23% from the fourth quarter.  Barclays’ analyst Benjamin Buddis was particularly impressed by the increase in interest yield that resulted from higher spreads on certain ""simple"" (i.e., non-Advanced Trade) trades that rolled out through Q1. While the trend “may not be sustainable long term,” he wrote, “[it] appears to be fairly sticky for now.”  Analysts at JPMorgan, were somewhat more dour, noting that volumes are under pressure thus far in the second quarter. They also remarked that the decline in USDC market capitalization is worrisome, while staking services aren’t performing as well as anticipated.  “While earnings were meaningfully better than expected, the outlook generally doesn’t seem as good,” they wrote, continuing with a neutral rating on the stock.  Goldman Sachs was also cautious, reminding of the “highly uncertain” regulatory outlook.  “We see risk that limited bandwidth in Congress increases the likelihood that regulatory developments will largely be driven by regulators, rather than policymakers,” the Goldman team wrote. “Thus, we see limited near-term catalysts for increased retail engagement, adoption in the U.S.”  Goldman maintained its sell rating on shares given the “lack of visibility around organic growth” and continuing uncertainty about the impact of regulation. The bank, however, increased its 12-month price target to $45 from $40, still about 20% lower than the current price of $57.60.  For its part, Coinbase has been extremely active advocating for better regulatory transparency in Washington D.C., continuing those efforts even after receiving a Wells Notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), informing the company of plans to pursue an enforcement action against the exchange and its staking services.

42420530,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqCtR,1683304260,The Need for Clarity in Washington – Not Just on Crypto,"So, will the Federal Reserve raise rates again at its next meeting?  Maybe. Maybe not. But, then again, it depends. I mean, Fed Chair Jerome Powell seemed like he sounded more dovish. Or perhaps it was that the FOMC’s statement felt less hawkish. Right? Kinda, no?  The ambiguous messaging from this week’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, with a statement from the committee and commentary from Powell that hinted at a monetary softening but was far from definitive, was frustrating for markets. But it was par for the course in the modern art of central bank policy-setting.  I see these moments, in which markets must dissect the cryptic signals of these 12 people to figure out what price to pay for financial assets, as a reminder that our economic lives hinge on the decisions of small groups of fallible humans. That’s an interesting situation for an AI age in which we are surrounded by digital technologies that can review, interpret and program responses to massive amounts of data in seconds. Now, more than ever, we should be demanding more clarity and transparency in policy-setting.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  That all probably sounds like I’m laying up a “trust in the math” argument to replace our flawed human institutions with predictable, decentralized, censorship-resistant cryptographic monetary systems such as Bitcoin’s. But I actually believe the sheer complexity of our global economy – made up of human beings with different needs, political views, incomes, wealth and debt scenarios – demands some flexibility and uncertainty in policy making. A rigid, deflationary monetary policy isn’t always the best thing; we need a human kill switch.  Nonetheless, given the repeated central banking failures of the past few crisis-wracked decades – not to mention all the mistakes made by our elected officials and regulators – shouldn’t we at least be demanding that our leaders enable some of these new tools to guide their and our decisions?  Data and tools  There’s a wealth of valuable data in blockchains that shed a light on human behavior. There are cryptographic verification systems such as proof-of-reserves that could provide real-time confidence in the liquidity of banks and other vital institutions. With hedge funds and other market heavyweights deploying powerful artificial intelligence tools to out-run all other market participants, policymakers are going to need powerful analytical tools of their own.  Read more: Proof of Reserves Explained  Instead, officials are increasingly reverting to opacity, deliberate ambiguity and equivocation. When asked during his Wednesday press conference if he thought monetary policy was too restrictive right now, Powell said, ""That's going to be an ongoing assessment. We're going to need data to accumulate on that. Not an assessment that we've made – that would mean we've reached that point. And I just think it's not possible to say that with confidence now.""  Forty-two words. Nothing said.  To be fair, the art of obfuscation is not a new practice among central bankers. The standard-bearer was Alan Greenspan, who occupied the powerful Fed chairmanship for 19 years before his exit in 2006, two years before the global financial crisis produced the ultimate legacy of his “new economy” position encouraging big banks, low rates and financial innovations such credit default swaps: the financial crisis of 2008. Greenspan’s meandering, obtuse commentaries spawned the term “Fedspeak.”  There’s strategic logic to the cryptic approach. Central bankers want to guide markets to an appropriate balance; they don’t want them to misinterpret their intentions and make an excessive response in either direction. But there’s also some CYA going on: the less you can commit to taking a clear position, the less you can be blamed for getting it wrong when circumstances turn against you.  Other officials  This tendency toward the opaque isn’t just for central bankers.  Consider the now famous exchange between the Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler’s during the latter’s appearance before the committee two weeks ago. McHenry repeatedly tried to get Gensler to provide his opinion on whether ether is a security and the SEC Chair kept reverting to a stock line drawn from the Howey Test. Sensing, each time he tried, that Gensler was avoiding the question, McHenry would interrupt him and ask the question again, pointedly. The effect was to expose the SEC’s lack of clarity on these issues as a counterpoint to the Chairman’s repeated claim that the “law is clear” for crypto companies.  Gensler was between a rock and a hard place. Much like Jerome Powell, he had to equivocate because a pronouncement either way would trigger a mass over-reaction in either direction in crypto markets. But McHenry is still right: the crypto industry deserves much more clarity from its regulators.  Read more: Securities vs. Commodities: Why It Matters For Crypto  Part of what’s happening is that Congress itself is unable to provide clarity. It can’t overcome its differences and legislate in a way that would set the right ground rules for the SEC, the Commodities Futures Trade Commission and other agencies that regulate crypto.  That, in turn, is a function of how divided it is – really of how divided the American population is. The result is the opposite of the empty word salads used by Powell and Gensler: we get very pointed, unambiguous, opposing statements from influential lawmakers on either side of the political divide. The lack of clarity in this case comes from their failure to come together, to find compromise and make laws. Just look at the debt ceiling standoff.  Regulators and policymakers like Gensler and Powell have to operate within this broken political environment, one marked by the lowest trust ratings in history for government. Their own lack of clarity is a survival mechanism for grappling with this wider uncertainty and malaise.  As I mentioned, blockchain and crypto have tools that might be helpful to cut through all that BS.

The influencer asserted that Ripple and XRP could get a new ally in the ongoing SEC lawsuit. Following Bitboy’s assertion, the potential ally is the largest US-based crypto exchange, Coinbase, which recently filed a petition against the SEC. Bitboy’s revelation follows a meeting between the chief legal officers of Ripple and Coinbase, Stuart Alderoty and Paul Grewal. Recent Events Hint At Potential Coinbase And Ripple Alliance Coinbase has been at cross-chairs with the SEC over the regulator’s approach to crypto regulation. This issue led Coinbase to sue the SEC in response to a Wells notice from the regulator alleging securities law violation. Related Reading: Bitcoin On-Chain Transactions Reach New Heights, What’s Fueling the Surge? Stuart Aderoty’s remark in response to Coinbase’s fight against the SEC led many to believe the two firms might align against the regulator. The recent statement by Bitboy and the meeting of the two lawyers further confirm these speculations. Although the specifics of the meetings remain unknown, both lawyers seemed excited about it. Grewal confirmed this by saying that they need to meet more often. More so, Stuart Alderoty expressed his gratitude, adding that Ripple’s legal team spent time discussing with Grewal. This statement suggests the meeting was professional and involved Ripple and Coinbase, not just a chance encounter. Why This Alliance May Be Imminent Due to the scarce information about the meeting, the XRP community began speculating on an alliance between the firms. John Deaton, commenting on the meeting between the two attorneys, noted that survival in the US regulatory atmosphere could require a team-up with one’s enemy. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin And Crypto Up Today? The alliance speculations follow advice from prominent personalities like US congress candidate January Walker and attorney John Deaton. These two have urged the crypto community to team up and fight against the SEC’s regulatory war on cryptocurrencies. Coinbase’s recent lawsuit against the SEC asking the regulator for clear regulatory guidelines excited the XRP community and the broader crypto industry. Moreover, Alderoty’s remark, “the enemy of my enemy is my friend,” shortly after Coinbase confirmed the Wells notice hinted at a potential alliance between both firms.

42420541,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqD6r,1683304044,Pump the BRCs: The Promise and Peril of Bitcoin-backed Tokens,"A new frenzy is sweeping cryptoland – so-called “BRC-20s” are fungible tokens deployed on the Bitcoin blockchain, and some are beginning to see major market activity. The proposed new standard was introduced in March by a coder known online as Domo, and it has a lot of interesting potential.  Tokens on Bitcoin aren’t a radically new idea – in fact, one of the earliest big experiments in crypto, “colored coins,” was an attempt to do something very similar. But BRC-20s, like Ordinal non-fungible tokens (NFTs), were enabled by new features introduced in Bitcoin’s recent Taproot upgrade.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  That’s the main point of the BRC-20 experiment – to see exactly what the new tech can do. When I reached out, Domo generously recommended a few resources for techies who want to dig deeper on BRC-20s. This basic intro for builders explains how to deploy BRC-20s and discusses some of the broader questions yet to be resolved. This is a more in-depth technical rundown by Domo. And this is a video introduction by YouTuber pazNGMI, which includes info on minting and wallets.  But Domo, and most other experts, have issued strong warnings against financial speculation in the new token format. In fact, just after the experimental standard was launched, Domo declared that “These will be worthless. Please do not waste money mass minting.”  With a flood of new BRC-20 memecoins being traded for real money, at least some people are clearly ignoring that warning. And it’s hard to blame them: in crypto, getting in first on anything new tends to be a decent strategy for speculators.  ‘These will be worthless’  So why would the first assets created with this exciting new technology be “worthless?” There are two prongs to the explanation.  On the one hand, the BRC-20 standard is just a proposal at this point, and there’s no guarantee it will be widely integrated into blockchain tools like wallets and exchanges. Average users will probably have a hard time accessing BRC-20s for the foreseeable future. Wallets have to have special features to read ordinals, and even more special features to read the new BRC-20s. Same goes for exchanges – as Domo warned in March, “It is unlikely that balances will be safely tradable using existing marketplace infrastructure.” Some exchanges are certainly gearing up to integrate BRC-20s, but the markets won’t be fully liquid for some time, even if BRC-20s become a widely-accepted standard.  But even that standardization could be a long way off: the design of BRC-20 isn’t necessarily finalized, much less fully vetted or adopted. In theory, there might be other ways to deploy tokens on Bitcoin, or further improvements to BRC-20 in its current form. If a competing or improved standard winds up being more widely adopted, the current wave of BRC-20s could become little more than digital museum pieces.  But second, and more fundamentally, it remains unclear just where the economic value of tokens issued on Bitcoin might come from.  Above all, this is a question because BRC-20s aren’t broadly compatible with smart contract or decentralized finance (DeFi) systems. Despite borrowing their nomenclature from Ethereum’s ERC-20s, they’re not technically parallel, and regardless, Bitcoin itself doesn’t have DeFi features. So if and when workarounds emerge, getting BRC-20s onto DeFi will likely involve bridges or other higher-risk structures.  For now, this means BRC-20s can’t serve as the backbone of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) or other more complex systems that would give them utility and value. There are certainly possible use cases for simple tokens on Bitcoin, but their structure may wind up being radically different from tokens on Ethereum – a topic for a deep dive at another time.  There’s a much more immediate downside to BRC-20s current limitations, even for degens happy to play the decentralized Ponzi game of memecoins. The lack of DeFi compatibility means that BRC-20s can’t benefit from liquidity provided by DeFi services like trading pools. So even pure speculation in the tokens may not have the frothy upside of a similar token issued on Ethereum.  See also: Pepecoin Short Sellers Lose Millions as PEPE Nears $1B Valuation  In fact, we’re seeing that play out right now. A BRC-20 known as “Pepe” is among those now being traded by a few daring basement-dwellers. BRC Pepe and all the other BRC-20s that currently exist had a combined fully diluted value (FDV) of $137 million as of May 2.  But there’s also a “Pepe” memecoin on Ethereum, which was launched in April. Its FDV now sits at $1.2 billion.  In short, BRC-20s are a fascinating innovation with seriously interesting potential. But if you’re looking for the lowbrow thrill of riding ephemeral pumps in animal-based casino tokens, it seems Ethereum should still be your home base.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,David Z.

42420539,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqD4n,1683302342,The Next Big Web3 Trend Wasn't on Stage at Consensus,"Last week at Consensus, Yat Siu nearly missed his talk on the Main Stage because he was swamped by a throng of adoring fans, desperate to steal a minute with the metaverse mogul. Siu’s fellow panelist, Maya Zehavi, and I, his moderator, were getting mic’d up backstage, watching as the production crew got more nervous with each passing minute. When someone finally found him and relayed back what had happened, I thought it was brilliant. Brilliant, because not even three years ago, Web3 and NFTs weren’t a thing. Blockchain gaming wasn’t a thing, and Yat Siu wasn’t getting mobbed by groupies. Early Web3 believers like Yat were more likely found at the fringes of major conferences, hosting meetups between themselves.  Leah Callon-Butler is the director of Emfarsis, an advisory and investment firm focused on Web3 and open Metaverse. With a special interest in the way that crypto is advancing emerging economies, Leah is a Coindesk opinion columnist and writer/narrator of the award-winning mini documentary, ""Play-to-Earn: NFT Gaming in the Philippines.”  I know this because I got involved before Web3 went gangbusters. I wrote the first-ever article about Axie Infinity on CoinDesk in August 2020, which many people think was early – and it was early – given Axie had less than 500 daily users at the time, before peaking at nearly three million a year later. But from my perspective, I was late. Because in hindsight, I can see that Web3 was taking shape as early as 2018. That was the year that Axie launched; Animoca Brands was seeding future Web3 juggernauts like DapperLabs and OpenSea; and the Blockchain Game Alliance (BGA) was formed. All this is remarkable, considering the rest of the blockchain industry still viewed blockchain gaming as more of an oxymoron than a legitimate use case. It wasn’t until later, when we got proof points such as the Beeple Everydays NFT that sold for $69.3 million in March 2021, that “NFT” was suddenly everyone’s favorite acronym.  And now in 2023, I’ve never been more confident that Web3 is here to stay. CoinDesk’s decision to dedicate an entire stage to the topics of metaverse and gaming at Consensus this year was a huge contributor to my bullishness, given the event is a prestigious annual check on the state of our industry, providing a snapshot of the characters, and sometimes, the chaos that has become the lore of our industry. For metaverse and gaming, it provides legitimacy to something that’s been a long time in the making. However, this in itself should remind us that conferences are a lagging indicator. And, as someone who is looking to identify the next trend before it goes mainstream, I’m inclined to think it’s already late-stage for the projects we see on stage.  It’s easy to be critical, that is, until you find yourself actually programming one of these stages – as I did, for the Metaverse and Gaming Stage at Consensus 2023. These big events need to draw a crowd, and without much traction or a substantial following, I can understand how risky it is to give up precious air time to some fledgling use case that might still be NGMI. So, in curating this three-day conversation, I aimed to strike a balance between the big-name draw cards like Jeffrey ‘Jihoz’ Zirlin of Sky Mavis, Sebastien Borget of The Sandbox, Spencer Tucker of Yuga Labs, and of course, Yat, while also giving space to lesser-known but equally impactful and inspiring people and projects that I’ve encountered over the last few years.  Like Cloudwhite, the second-largest holder of virtual land in Axie’s metaverse, Lunacia. This guy recognized the value of digital ownership and verifiable scarcity way before big brands like Atari, Warner Music and Gucci aped in on the trend – not because he had a fancy college degree or millions of dollars to deploy, but because he was an obsessive collector as a kid, hoarding Pokémon cards and selling Beanie Babies out the trunk of his mom’s car.  Or Anand Venkateswaran, formerly known as Twobadour, a pseudonym owned by his previous employer, the Metapurse fund. While most know Metapurse as the fund behind that fabled $69.3 million Beeple buy, they don’t know that Metapurse also bought the most expensive NFT of 2019; its $100,000 price tag is pittance compared to what people pay for NFTs today, but given the immaturity of the market at that time, in my eyes, that was an even crazier move, requiring even higher conviction, when almost nobody was watching.  Their scrappy beginnings make romantic fodder for a fireside chat, but nostalgia is no advantage if you’re looking to catch a trend before it hits the headlines. For each of the men I mentioned here, this was their first year speaking at Consensus – which means it was years before they made it to the big leagues. Which is why I hope you listened to the speakers at Consensus 2023 that didn’t make it onto any official stage. That random who pitched you in the coffee queue or that degen ranting at the after party could’ve been the next Yat, the next Cloudwhite, or quite literally, the next Twobadour. The vuvuzelas honking in the stadium are certainly hard to ignore, but you should also try to listen for the squeaking of mice beneath the grandstand. Because a murmur heard amid the winter could be the next bull run’s roar.

42420537,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqD3l,1683301879,"Craig Wright Shows ‘Prima Facie Evidence’ of Contemptuous Conduct, U.S. Judge Says","Craig Wright, who has claimed to be the founder of Bitcoin, has shown “prima facie evidence” of contemptuous conduct in court proceedings for failing to correctly provide information linked to $143 million in disputed cryptocurrency, a U.S. judge said in a ruling published Friday.  Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart issued the ruling as a case grinds on between Wright, who claims to be Satoshi Nakomoto, the pseudonymous author of the 2008 Bitcoin white paper, and Ira Kleiman, who claimed rights to crypto he said was mined by his late brother David.  In 2022, a judge found in favor of Kleiman and linked company W&K. But W&K says Wright never fully provided the personal information needed to enforce the payment, and has asked the court to conduct contempt of court proceedings, and impose fines of $250,000 per day.  “On the present record, there is prima facie evidence of contemptuous conduct,” Reinhart said in response to that request, saying Wright had “refused to provide basic information about his spouse and her assets” on the form.  Wright’s claim that the form should be kept for attorney’s eyes only to avoid revealing sensitive personal data “is factually false…the designation was improper from the beginning,” Reinhart said.  The form, now unsealed by Reinhart, gives Satoshi Nakomoto as Wright’s nickname or alias, and states that his assets have been transferred or assigned to others.  Wright and his attorneys have until May 18 to show why they should not face a sanction for seeking to keep information confidential, under legal provisions designed to stop unreasonable or vexatious inflation of court costs. A further hearing on July 6 in Palm Beach, Florida, will consider the facts linked to the alleged non-compliance.  Wright – who has argued the information he provided on the form was accurate, but that he is unable or legally restricted from providing some of the data requested – will be given a further opportunity to make that case, Reinhart said.  In April, a judge at the High Court in England ruled it wasn’t in the public interest to continue to pursue contempt of court proceedings against Wright even if there was, at first sight, evidence that he had revealed details of a judgment before it was supposed to be published.  In December, Wright was granted permission to appeal a Norwegian court’s finding that social media user Magnus Granath, also known as Hodlonaut, had been entitled to post tweets in 2019 calling Wright a “fraud” and a “scammer” for his claim to be Sastoshi.

12373110,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=530089,1683301207,Stacks (STX) Stumbles As Bulls Fail To Remain Intact,"On March 20, 2023, Stacks (STX) hit an all-time high of $1.30. But the price declined below the $1 mark on March 25 as the bears increased momentum. The asset has remained under the mark from March until May 5. The 4-hour time frame chart today indicates that the STX token is trading on a downtrend movement due to high selling pressure. The token is also in a long-term downtrend, with the bears increasing its selling pressure forming lower highs and higher lows. Will The Bulls Dethrone The Bears From The Market? The overall structure of the STX market is bearish, with the bears battling with the bulls to take full control. The 4-hour chart shows that the STACK token is trading at $0.7276, with a decrease of -6.47% within the last 24 hours. Related Reading: This Meme Coin Created By GPT-4 Is Now Worth $40 Million, Here’s Why STX’s 24-hour trading volume is down by 56.76%, with a total market cap of $1 billion. This also shows that STX is not experiencing many activities at the moment. Despite the increased selling momentum resulting from the investor’s sentiment, the bulls are attempting to regain control by taking advantage of the support level at $0.67. Stacks (STX) Price Analysis Currently, STX is trading within the range of the 200-day simple moving average and the 50-day simple moving average, suggesting a neutral market position or consolidation phase. Related Reading: Pro-XRP Attorney Shares Information That Could Be Bullish For Ripple Consequently, traders and investors may use the 50-day and 200-day SMAs as reliable support and resistance levels while trading. Notably, a breach above the 50-day SMA may signal a potential short-term uptrend, presenting a buying opportunity for traders. The fact that STX lacks an obvious trend, either upward or downward, suggests that the price is stable. Currently, the RSI level of STX is 41, which shows that the STX market is heading towards the neutral zone, and there’s indecision. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line is below the signal line, which suggests a potential sell opportunity. Moreover, the histogram, which measures the distance between the MACD line and the signal line, is below the zero line, indicating that the security is trading below its long-term trend. Additionally, the histogram is increasing, implying that the bearish momentum is gaining strength. This situation suggests that STX is facing downward pressure, which could continue for some time, allowing traders to short the token. STX trades between the $0.6666 and $0.8275 primary support and resistance levels. Stack’s first important resistance level is $0.8275. If the price rises above this level, the next significant resistance levels are $1.0212 and 1.3103. Conversely, with high selling pressure, the price of STX may fall below its important support levels of $0.5220 & $0.2684.

42420532,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqCwX,1683299583,Securities vs. Commodities: Why It Matters For Crypto,"Securities and commodities are two very different financial instruments and in the U.S., are regulated by two different government organizations. When it comes to cryptocurrencies, a legal determination that a cryptocurrency is either one of those financial instruments has wide-ranging implications about how it can be sold, where it can be listed and who might sue if an issuer oversteps the mark.  The matter is far from decided, and given the breadth of the crypto market, it is likely that there won’t be a one-size-fits-all decision, but will vary depending on the token.  In this article, we will try to explain the differences between securities and commodities and explore the ongoing debate about whether or not cryptocurrencies should be classified as one or the other.  Securities and commodities explained  To get started, let’s first define securities and commodities.  Securities are financial instruments that represent a claim on the issuer, such as stocks, bonds and derivatives and are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Following a landmark lawsuit from 1946, SEC v W. J. Howey Co., U.S. securities law defined sales of securities as “investment contracts” – meaning that a person who invests money in a security “is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party,” according to the decision. The investors could later realize that profit through the sale of the security, or by collecting dividends or interest payments. The “Howey test” that derives from this decision has already been used in several SEC enforcement cases, notably in The DAO case, a suit against Ripple’s XRP token and more recently in a case against Dapper Labs, who created NBA Top Shot, a sports collectible non-fungible token (NFT), and associated marketplace.  Commodities, on the other hand, are physical goods that are traded on exchanges in wholesale quantities. These can include agricultural products like corn and wheat, as well as precious metals like gold and silver. Commodities are typically traded based on their current market value. In the U.S., certain wrongdoing in commodities trading is policed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), but the agency doesn't yet have broader regulatory authority over spot trading, like the SEC's powers over securities.  Why it matters whether crypto is a security or a commodity  So, how does this affect cryptocurrencies and their regulation?  If a cryptocurrency is a security, cryptocurrency issuers and exchanges must seek the necessary licenses from their securities regulators. This is usually pretty difficult to do, so the crypto industry spends a huge amount of effort trying to ensure that cryptocurrency sales and developments avoid securities laws.  The principal way in which issuers seek to avoid violating securities law is through decentralization. If a cryptocurrency is developed in such a way that a securities regulator could not identify a central, coordinated group responsible for driving up the value of the token, then the asset is less likely to be considered a security. That is one reason why decentralized finance (DeFi) projects take measures to decentralize the development of their projects and split up governance with decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), as well as involve mechanisms like proof-of-stake as a consensus mechanism. The argument being that if people are both investors as well as participate in the growth of the project, either by staking the coin and becoming validators, or voting in DAO decisions, they are no longer solely relying on the “third party” to produce returns that the Howey test requires.  The risk for cryptocurrencies being classified as securities is that exchanges may not list them to avoid the risk of being fined by the SEC for listing unregistered securities. There are also further state-by-state rules and regulations that cryptocurrencies can run afoul of, such as the suit against KuCoin by the New York Attorney General or multiple states’ regulators teaming up to target a coin featuring Elon Musk’s image.  One of the first formal guidance publications by the SEC related to the ICO (initial coin offering) boom. The SEC’s Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology reinforced its guidance in April 2019 with its “Framework for the Investment Contract Analysis of Digital Assets,” which noted the speculative nature of many of the ICOs, their lack of utility and inability to be used as a payment or store of value as some factors that would lead those coins to be classified as securities.  One ICO that failed to get it right was Kik. When the CEO of Kik, Ted Livingston, accidentally told a crowd that buying Kin tokens would make them a “ton of money,” the SEC sued Kik, arguing that he had pushed investors to purchase Kin tokens with an expectation of profits. The SEC eventually fined Kik $5 million; the lawsuit nearly bankrupted the company.  On the other side, the CFTC has long argued that cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether are commodities and can be regulated as such under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA).  This underpinning argument of the CTFC is that because bitcoin, for example, is interchangeable on exchanges – each bitcoin is of identical worth, just like how a sack of corn is of equal worth to another sack of corn of the same grade – it is a commodity. This determination was solidified in the CFTC’s case against crypto exchange Bitfinex and its sister company, stablecoin issuer Tether. In an October 2021 filing, the agency said that “digital assets such as bitcoin, ether, litecoin and tether” are all commodities.  Where the regulatory debate stands  There are a lot of interested parties and a lot of moving parts, so it’s hard to predict what the regulatory landscape will look like a year from now. Many of the U.S. congressional efforts have focused on granting the CFTC wider latitude to regulate spot trading of the non-securities tokens, of which bitcoin is so far the only one openly agreed on by both agencies.  One potential outcome of this debate would be that some cryptocurrencies are classified as securities, while others are classified as commodities. This could lead to an even more complex regulatory landscape in which different cryptocurrencies are subject to different rules and regulations.  Another alternative is that lawmakers could decide to treat crypto as its own asset class, with bespoke rules. That’s the approach largely taken by the European Union, where the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation sets out the steps to be followed by crypto issuers, wallet providers and exchanges to protect consumers and ensure fair trading. Even then, there are still likely to be legal gray areas which will need to be looked at case by case – such as whether a particular series of non-fungible tokens will need to follow the rules.  In April 2023, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R–N.C.) said that the U.S. will have a crypto bill in two months that will address both securities and commodities issues, which was supported by Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), who is known as the senate’s “Crypto Queen.” In 2022, Lummis teamed up with Sen. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) to introduce the Responsible Financial Innovation Act (RFIA) with the aim to clearly demarcate what is a security and what is a commodity. Lummis expects to introduce a new, improved version of the bill in the summer of 2023.  Meanwhile, SEC chair Gary Gensler, has said he believes his agency has the authority to oversee crypto and that ""most crypto tokens are securities,"" but during a contentious hearing in April 2023, refused to answer whether or not ether was a security. SEC attorneys have indicated that staffers may view crypto tokens such as Voyager’s VGX as securities, even where the agency hasn’t reached a formal view.  In May 2023, the SEC removed its definition of “digital asset” in the final version of a hedge fund rule, which would have been its first formal definition of the term, saying they are “continuing to consider this term” at this time.

12371402,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=530081,1683295248,"Mystery Wallet Burns 1.69 Billion Shiba Inu, Will It Result In Price Bump?","An unidentified Shiba Inu wallet holder burnt about 1.69 billion SHIB in a single transaction. This burn event caused the overall SHIB burn rate to increase by 38,986.28%, exceeding yesterday’s burn rate of 1.34 million SHIB. SHIB burn events are critical to its price movement since they eliminate excess tokens in circulation and the 1.69 billion SHIB burn represents the third-largest burn event this week. However, the burn event did not significantly impact SHIB’s price, although it could improve its performance in the long term. SHIB Burn Rate Increasing This Week Shiba Inu experienced massive burn events this week from some of its top holders. CultPunks and a mysterious wallet are among the main contributors to these burns. A total of 2.25 billion SHIB token burns occurred on May 3-4. These transactions significantly increase the SHIB burns on the network in 2023. Related Reading: Pro-XRP Attorney Shares Information That Could Be Bullish For Ripple The new NFT collection on the Modulus Network, Cultpunks, burnt 246.74 million SHIB in a single transaction. Also, Blaze Token sent approximately 2 billion SHIB to the dead wallet in a single transaction. These burns contributed to the overall burn rate that increased progressively to date. Amid the ongoing burn transactions, some whales continue to accumulate SHIB tokens. Etherscan.io revealed that a prominent SHIB whale purchased 221.72 million SHIB worth $2.23 million in a single transaction. The whale started its purchases on April 25, 2023, when it bought 730.61 million SHIB. Also, on April 27, the same whale acquired an additional 76.31 billion SHIB worth $770,036. Additionally, the SHIB whale bought 49.34 billion SHIB worth $495,868 on April 29. Lastly, the same SHIB whale purchased 348.11 billion SHIB tokens worth $3.50 million last week in four transactions, bringing its current holdings to 21.6 trillion SHIB tokens ($218.19 million). Will The Burns And Whale Accumulation Boost Shiba Inu? Shiba Inu is fluctuating today despite the news of increasing token burns and accumulations. It has formed a Gravestone Doji candlestick indicating the possibility of further decline in its price. SHIB is trading below its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), suggesting a bearish sentiment in the short and long term. Also, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) value is 35.97, close to the oversold region of 30. However, the indicator is moving sideways, reflecting traders’ uncertainty in the market today. Related Reading: This Meme Coin Created By GPT-4 Is Now Worth $40 Million, Here’s Why SHIB has dropped below the $0.0000102 support level turning it to resistance. Its closest support level is $0.00000963 and a decline below this level will push the asset into the oversold region. Also, its resistance levels are $0.0000102, $0.00001188, $0.000014, and $0.0000159. SHIB will likely decline to rest on the $0.00000963 support if the bears sustain their charge.

42420542,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqD7t,1683291667,New York Attorney General Seeks New Crypto Powers for State Regulators,"The New York Department of Financial Services would have stronger authority to regulate digital assets, with exchanges having to reimburse customers if they’re the victims of fraud, under a bill proposed by Attorney General Letitia James on Friday.  ""We're proposing commonsense measures to protect investors and end the fraud and dysfunction that have become the hallmarks of cryptocurrency,"" James said.  The New York legislation could directly oppose some core tendencies of crypto companies to provide a range of activity, such as trading platforms, custody and brokerage services. That all-in-one approach would be counted as an illegal conflict of interests under the attorney general's proposal. The legislation also seeks to ban marketplaces from keeping custody of customer funds.  In recent months James has taken actions involving crypto companies Celsius, KuCoin and Nexo, claiming a number of crypto tokens are commodities or securities despite a considerable gray area over the scope of existing law, and the bill would also give her extra enforcement powers, James tweeted Friday. In the absence of federal oversight of crypto, New York has been a de facto leader in U.S. regulation of the industry – an approach that other states including California and Illinois have sought to follow but haven't yet established regulations.  The proposed legislation targets a range of stakeholders from crypto issuers and exchange platforms to digital asset influencers, with all to be held to detailed disclosure requirements. Investors would be offered details of risks and conflicts of interest, and crypto companies wouldn't be able to borrow or lend customers' assets, James' tweet said.  ""The bill would grant the Attorney General jurisdiction to enforce any violation of the law, issue subpoenas, impose civil penalties of $10,000 per violation per individual or $100,000 per violation per firm, collect restitution, damages, and penalties, and shut down businesses engaging in fraud and illegality,"" a press statement from Friday said.  The state's crypto activities are regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services' (NYDFS), the supervisor of the controversial ""BitLicense,"" but the support James' bill has received from several members of the state's legislature suggests the regulator may not have had sufficient authority to oversee the sector.  “I applaud New York State Attorney General Letitia James for the timely introduction of this legislation to protect New Yorkers from financial harm by establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for the opaque cryptocurrency market,” State Senator Kevin Parker said in a press statement, while Steve Otis, state lawmaker representing Westchester County, called the legislation ""groundbreaking.""  “The lack of transparency plaguing the crypto industry causes immense harm to countless investors, especially low-income New Yorkers and people of color who carry a disproportionate share of the losses,” New York City Comptroller Brad Lander said.  An NYDFS spokesperson told CoinDesk in a statement that the regulator was currently the ""only prudential regulator"" that has crypto-specific authority in the U.S., and ""it is DFS’s priority to ensure that consumers and markets are protected and New York continues to be the global financial center.""  ""Recent DFS guidance has made clear expectations around the use of blockchain analytics technology, U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin issuance, banks engaging in virtual asset activity, and consumer protections in light of insolvencies,"" the spokesperson said. ""Earlier this year, the Department was the first regulator to address Binance, ordering Paxos to cease minting Paxos-issued BUSD, ameliorating risks before consumers were harmed. The Department also reached a $100 million settlement with Coinbase after an investigation found that the platform was vulnerable to serious criminal conduct, such as money laundering, suspected child sexual abuse material-related activity, and potential narcotics trafficking.""  In March, James’ suit against KuCoin claimed that tokens including ether (ETH) constitute securities that should have been registered with her office, and in a case against CoinEx made similar claims about the LUNA token connected with the now-defunct stablecoin terraUSD.  Earlier this week, Alex Mashinsky, the founder of Celsius, denied claims by James that he had misled investors about the crypto lender before it filed for bankruptcy last year, saying that James had cherry picked statements made to investors.  James' bill will codify NYDFS' authority to license and oversee crypto brokers, marketplaces, investment advisors and issuers prior to operating in the state.  Andrew Hinkes, a partner at law firm K&L Gates, tweeted that the bill was “destined to fail” because it misunderstood crypto. It won’t be possible to apply the provisions to decentralized organizations, and the market doesn’t exist to offer the kind of auditing or insurances James is proposing, Hinkes said.  The bill must still be passed by state lawmakers for it to become state law.  The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg had reported on the bill earlier on Friday.

12370375,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=530067,1683291642,4 Reasons To Be Bullish On Bitcoin In Short-And Mid-Term,"The Bitcoin price continues to consolidate within the trading range between $27,800 and $30,000. Even though the buy side currently seems to have lost momentum and the bears feel in control, there are numerous good arguments why the Bitcoin price will write new yearly highs in the short and medium term. 4-Hour Chart Of Bitcoin A look at the 4-hour chart of Bitcoin shows that the price has been writing higher lows since the price reached a low of $27,000 on April 24. A higher low occurs when the price hits a new low that is higher than the previous low, without a lower low preceding it. Thus, the current price movement of BTC indicates an uptrend. The $30,000 level should be the next target as long as BTC stays above $28,800. US Banking Crisis Another driver for the Bitcoin price in the short and medium term can be the ongoing US banking crisis. The last few weeks have shown that BTC has reacted strongly to the news, and for the most part has seen a rise. Ultimately, Bitcoin was created for this very purpose: an escape from the fractional reserve banking system. Because of this, it is also not surprising that Bitcoin has seen its highest correlation with gold in two years. Physical gold has written new all-time highs in recent days, Bitcoin could be spurred by this. Related Reading: Bitcoin On-Chain Transactions Reach New Heights, What’s Fueling the Surge? The lead economist at $646 billion asset manager AllianceBernstein, Jared Bernstein, recently acknowledged that Bitcoin will establish itself as an alternative financial system in times of bank failure, and urged people to buy Bitcoin. Bernstein predicted that the U.S. banking crisis is “far from over,” adding, “We believe Bitcoin will emerge again as a faster horse than gold.” FED’s Interest Rate Pause In June? Even though the financial markets initially gave a bearish reaction to the FOMC press conference on Wednesday, the market does not believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) will raise interest rates again in June. Effectively, the market is expecting a pivot, meaning an initial pause in rate hikes on June 14. The CME’s FedWatch tool shows that an overwhelming majority of 99.1% currently expect a pause in interest rates in June. More than 85% expect the first rate cut as early as September and at least three rate cuts by the end of the year. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin And Crypto Up Today? And even JP Morgan’s Davis believes that “this is definitely the end of the rate hike cycle for the Fed” and a Fed pivot could come “as early as September.” Due to the credit crunch and banking woes, the Fed will be forced to pump liquidity into the market prematurely, BTC will benefit greatly. Bitcoin Will Rise If History Repeats Itself As the analysts at Rekt Capital write, the Bitcoin price is currently in a similar consolidation phase as it was in 2019.

42420547,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqDD3,1683291280,First Mover Americas: Meme Coin PEPE Surges to $1B Market Cap,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Pepecoin (PEPE), the new token based on “pepe the frog” meme, has reached a $1 billion market capitalization after it debuted last month. The token has gained 70% over the past 24 hours, reaching an all-time high, according to data from CoinGeko. The PEPE rally has spurred increased trading activity in other meme tokens on decentralized exchanges, according to data from IntoTheBlock. For instance, WOJAK and PEEPO have climbed more than 600% in a week. Longer-standing meme tokens such as dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB) have not witnessed the same price movement, both trading in the red on the week.  U.K.'s financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), continues its crackdown on unlawful crypto ATMs. The FCA said it has inspected sites in Exeter, Nottingham and Sheffield alongside the regional police. The devices for turning fiat currency into crypto are seen as a money laundering threat, and none are logged with the FCA as is required by law, the regulator said in a statement on Friday. “Crypto ATMs operating without FCA registration are illegal,” said Therese Chambers, the FCA’s Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight. “We will act to stop illegal activity.”  Crypto exchange Coinbase reported Q1 revenue of $773 million, exceeding analysts’ estimates of $655 million, according to FactSet, and up from Q4 revenue of $629 million. The company reported an adjusted loss of $0.34 per share, versus estimated loss of $1.45 per share and a narrowing from Q4’s loss of $2.45 per share. Trading volume came in at $145 billion versus estimates of $147.7 million for the quarter. Trading volume was roughly $146 billion in the fourth quarter. Shares of Coinbase were up about 8% to $53 in after-hours trading Thursday. Shares are up about 40% this year, with bitcoin’s rise of roughly 74% year to date.     Chart of the Day  The chart shows gold's weekly price action since May 2017.  The yellow metal is looking to break out its three-year trading range amid many uncertainties, including the U.S. debt ceiling issue, banking sector instability, and recession fears.  According to Matrixport, a breakout in gold would bode well for bitcoin.  ""Gold has been leading Bitcoin since November 2022 and both assets appear to be correlated,"" Markus Thielen, research and strategy head at Matrixport and the author of Crypto Titans said in a weekly report.  ""Bitcoin will likely fly higher under the wing of gold as the yellow metal makes new all-time highs,"" Thielen added.

With lower prices and some investor reluctance, several ETFs have closed in 2023. Many investors are choosing to access bitcoin and broader crypto themes through traditional ETF wrappers due to their relative simplicity and familiarity. Year-to-date, bitcoin prices are up 72.7%, and crypto ETFs like the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI) are also impressively up 128.9%. WMGI is currently the highest performing equity ETF YTD, while the remaining top 10 ETFs are all also crypto-related ETFs. This outperformance has been catching investor interest, but flows haven’t been matching up. WGMI has only $5.7 million net inflows this year, which places it at 647 out of 1,969 equity ETFs — just barely in the top third. Some investors may still be reluctant to invest in crypto despite bitcoin prices rising back to near the $30,000 level, while some long-term crypto fans are still adding to their crypto allocations. Even for those that aren’t huge believers in the crypto industry, crypto ETFs can be a simple, familiar way to invest in a high-reward/high-risk portion of a market — which may fit into many investor portfolios in small allocations of 1%–5%. This note looks at a brief history of crypto ETFs, including what ETFs are currently available, while explaining some of the key differences between the different types of crypto ETFs. What Crypto ETFs Currently Exist? Before I describe the different types of crypto ETFs, it is useful to look at the crypto ETF industry timeline. The ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) , which holds the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Coinbase Global (COIN) as its largest holdings, can be traced back to its inception in September 2014. Back then, the ETF was called the ARK Web x.0 with top holdings like LinkedIn (eventually acquired by Microsoft (MSFT) , Netflix (NFLX) , and Amazon (AMZN) . True blockchain ETFs didn’t appear until a few years later in 2018. The Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) and the Siren Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF (BLCN) were the first blockchain ETFs to launch on January 17, 2018 (although BLOK was actually the first to file for registration). After a couple of more launches, things were relatively calm for several years, until 2021 when more unique products began to appear partly due to higher Bitcoin prices and more investor interest (see chart below). The VanEck Digital Transformation ETF (DAPP) kicked off a new wave of launches in April 2021, but it wasn’t until May 2021 that the Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ) was launched as the first ETF with crypto in its name. Several other crypto equity ETFs appeared as bitcoin headed toward another peak. In October 2021, another significant milestone occurred — the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) was launched, which was the first futures-based ETF. This was followed by other futures-based bitcoin ETFs like the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF) and the VanEck Strategy ETF (XBTF) . The ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITI) , which is the first and only inverse futures bitcoin ETF was launched in June 2022. Since then, only a few ETFs have launched — the latest was launched on September 30, 2022. In 4Q22, the crypto industry hit a rut with the collapse of FTX and bitcoin prices falling below $20,000. With lower prices and some investor reluctance, several ETFs have closed in 2023. The Viridi Bitcoin Miners ETF (RIGZ) closed on January 4, 2023, followed by the Volt Crypto Industry Revolution and Tech ETF (BTCR), which closed on January 17, and the VanEck Digital Assets Mining ETF (DAM), which closed on April 24. With the closures of RIGZ and DAM, WGMI is now the only bitcoin mining ETF in the U.S. Despite the number of closures, there are still around 25 crypto ETFs in the U.S. which serve various purposes and can provide investors with different options. A few of these types are listed below. Futures-Based ETFs Closely Track the Price of Bitcoin Using Futures Contracts While many have tried to launch a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S., the SEC has continued to reject spot bitcoin ETF applications, citing a lack of investor protection and market uncertainty. Grayscale — which is the most high-profile case — has been trying to convert its existing Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot-based bitcoin ETF for several years. Application rejections also include those from ETF giants like ARK 21Shares, WisdomTree, Global X, Fidelity, First Trust, and VanEck, among several others. Futures-based bitcoin ETFs are the next alternative to a spot bitcoin ETF. These ETFs track bitcoin futures to replicate the price of bitcoin. They can give investors exposure to bitcoin in a more familiar structure that may be easier to invest in through certain accounts. While futures exposure provides a close comparison to spot exposure, many argue that using futures may lead to lower returns and higher fees due to the rolling forward of future contracts. But so far, the SEC has been more willing to approve a futures-based ETF because bitcoin futures are already overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). While most advisors and investors have cited a preference toward spot-based ETFs, futures-based ETFs have still been well-received. When the first U.S. futures-based ETF (BITO) was launched in October 2021, it became the second-most heavily traded ETF in history on its launch date and currently has the highest AUM out of all bitcoin and digital asset ETFs in the U.S. (not including ARKW, which is one of the more diversified crypto ETFs). Besides the futures-based ETFs above, other crypto ETFs may include futures in combination with crypto equities, crypto ETFs, and other assets. Crypto Equity ETFs — High Correlation to Bitcoin in Addition to Long-Term Themes In the most recent crypto asset benchmark survey by Bitwise and VettaFi, advisors were asked if they would rather invest in crypto assets or crypto equity ETFs. The majority of advisors preferred crypto equity ETFs (25%) to crypto assets (17%). Crypto-related ETFs provide an indirect (yet still strong) exposure to the price of bitcoin. These companies include crypto miners, crypto exchanges, crypto banks, crypto buyers, and other players in the crypto ecosystem (see this note for more details). Even though these ETFs have high correlations with bitcoin, the purpose of these ETFs is not to track the price of bitcoin. Instead, these ETFs aim to provide sector and/or thematic exposure to digital asset and blockchain companies, which support long-term megatrends like digital transformation and innovation. Most of these companies are high-growth, small-cap technology stocks, so these ETFs can be included as a portion of a broader technology allocation. None of these ETFs use “bitcoin” within their names, but instead use phrases like blockchain , digital assets , crypto economy , and crypto innovators to convey a broader investment purpose rather than just tracking the price of bitcoin. You can also think of this like investing in energy companies instead of investing in oil as a commodity. Bottom Line Many investors are choosing to access bitcoin and broader crypto themes through traditional ETF wrappers due to their relative simplicity and familiarity. While there have been some crypto ETF closures in 2023, there are still around 25 crypto ETFs in the U.S. which can provide a diverse range of options for investors looking to add an allocation to bitcoin or the crypto economy.

But we must still evaluate each altcoin. I consider altcoins risky assets, but many will rally with Bitcoin. I am highlighting three altcoins you might consider as long as Bitcoin remains bullish: ImmutableX, GMX, and Rocketpool. The most recent articles that Jason and I released discussed the possibility that Bitcoin (BTC-USD) will behave bullishly for the remainder of 2023. But we do not foresee the price action in Bitcoin as clean. If Bitcoin makes it into six-figure prices over the next year or two, it will do so in a very choppy fashion. I see the price action in Bitcoin from 2018 until today as a large ending diagonal. That means the leg from $15,500 to my expected $125K should take on an ABC structure. That is much harder to trade than the five-wave structure of an impulse, which tends to have more upward velocity and shallower pullbacks than ABC structures. As difficult as I expect the price action to be, since its November 2022 low, Bitcoin has printed higher lows on its daily chart with no sign of a let-up. Bitcoin, Daily Chart (Created in Motivewave) A Warning Before we dive into a few choice altcoins, we have to acknowledge the risks. Firstly, I liken investing in altcoins to participating in venture capitalism, but without the legal rights imbued in the deals in which VCs participate. Altcoin investors make bets on projects they are passionate about. However, most of the time the tokens involved don't offer rights to the cash flows of such projects if they are successful. That said, I still believe the crypto sector has birthed many projects that have changed finance forever. As an example, the utility of decentralized DEXs has led to their volume eclipsing those of centralized exchanges in the last year. I am cheering on many such projects. But that doesn't mean one must own a DEX's token. Most often, the best way to participate in the fees from DEX traders is to participate in the liquidity pools of such DEXs. The tokens of leading DEXs such as Uniswap (UNI-USD), SushiSwap (SUSHI-USD), and PancakeSwap (CAKE-USD), by and large, have done terribly despite the success of the products they represent. Jason and I have seen many counts in altcoins fail. They consistently tend not to fill in large-scale impulses, often failing in three waves before they commence a path to all-time lows. With that said, applying Elliott Wave analysis to altcoins is a means to evaluate when sentiment is likely to drive prices higher. We have been able to trail stops and get out when failure happens. Trailing stops coupled with regular profit-taking leads to great gain. This is to say: if you are an investor, don't touch altcoins. Stick with Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH-USD) as they have proven their long-term trends. And, if you venture into altcoins, you need to know when to get out early, sometimes at a loss, when warranted. After hearing my fair warning, let's look at three that I am interested in now. ImmutableX ImmutableX is a company building web3 infrastructure for creating play-to-earn games and NFTs. It is a Layer-2 scaling solution on the Ethereum blockchain. The ImmutableX token, IMX (IMX-USD), is a highly speculative play. It was launched at the beginning of the 2021-22 bear market, in November 2021. Naturally, after its launch, it remained in an incessant downtrend through December 2022. That means there are lots of earnest sellers anxious to get their money back. However, after printing its all-time low of 37 cents on December 30, 2022, IMX started a strong rally that brought it to $1.59 on March 18, 2023. That made many previous owners whole. But after that high, a new downtrend started. From an Elliott Wave perspective, the 2023 rally in IMX appears to be a nice impulsive rally with five waves into the March high. That means the current correction since that high is likely a wave 2 before IMX starts to form a larger degree five-wave structure. This wave 2, shown on my chart below, should bottom between 77 and 54 cents. Right now it looks like it will come very close to the lower number. Below 54 cents, sustained, I will no longer have a bullish perspective and will expect new all-time lows. But assuming IMX can hold up, and depending on where it finds a final bottom, my target for the next degree can range from $4.85 to $10. IMX Daily Chart (Tradingview) GMX The GMX (GMX-USD) token is issued by GMX.io, a decentralized perpetual futures exchange that runs on the Arbitrum (ARB-USD) and Avalanche (AVAX-USD) networks. It functions as a governance token and the exchange shares 30% of fees with the holders. That makes it one of the few tokens that provides a cash flow that is not produced by inflation, but rather a cash flow that comes into the ecosystem from users via trading fees. GMX was born during the crypto bear market of 2022 but never participated in that year's downtrend, as volume on the exchange continued to grow. The low on my chart was on June 15, 2022, when it traded at $9.70. At that time, Bitcoin traded at $22,500. When Bitcoin posted its 52-week low on November 9, 2022, near $15,500, GMX traded at $26.45. As Bitcoin began its recent uptrend from that low, GMX only strengthened. It trades at $69.17 at the time of writing. I don't find the long chart incredibly clean, partly because of its short history. That causes caution when it comes to suggesting longer-term swing trades. However, today we have a nice, immediately bullish, low-risk set-up in GMX. Support for the trade is $59.30. Breaking that is not necessarily bearish but it makes an already murky long-term chart even less clear. So I will use that level as a stop. If that level holds, GMX is aimed at $164. That level is presumably the top of the third in a large C wave. But after that level is hit, I will take substantial profit until the long-term intentions of the chart are more clear. GMX Daily Chart (Tradingview) Rocketpool This next coin is a long-term set-up. That's not intended to conflict with my warning statements about altcoins. I am saying that this set-up may take time to materialize into gains. One must still be careful about how much to risk in this coin. Rocketpool is among a few protocols that allow users to participate in Ethereum validation and its monetary rewards by staking as little as 0.01 Ethereum. Without the protocol, to be an Ethereum validator one must stake at least 32 Ethereum. The difference at today's prices is $18 versus $58,400. The protocol's token, RPL (RPL-USD), is used as a governance token and a currency with which to pay protocol fees. RPL rallied from $1.20 to $63 in 2021 in a structure that may be called a leading diagonal. After topping in 2021, it declined into the $7 region in June 2022. But it didn't continue to decline with Bitcoin into November of that year. It reversed, went back to $35, and started a series of higher highs and lows. Finally, in the last two months, it made new all-time highs. In the short term, I can see RPL continuing into the $90 to $120 region as long as $33 holds. However, this region requires care. If at any time it sustains below $33 it can drop back to the $7 region in my red c-wave. I am treating that as likely and keeping my position very light. I will scale into the $30s, should that pullback occur. That is because the circle-2 is valid down to $2.91. If it holds, RPL has a shot at reaching $600 above in its third wave. If it never prints that lower red C-wave, so be it; my small position will produce great profit on a percentile basis. These are monstrous ranges to deal with, so you can't take on the position size you are used to in low-beta stocks, or high-beta for that matter. You have to keep it light so you can afford to capture volatility. I pride myself on making a lot in crypto by risking very little on each trade. RPL Daily Chart (Tradingview) Conclusion In conclusion, Bitcoin is likely to be bullish for the rest of 2023. But unfortunately, the action so far suggests a very choppy path to $125K. If at any time $18K breaks, this view becomes questionable. Because Bitcoin tends to bring many altcoins with it, a bullish Bitcoin cycle is a safer time to trade altcoins. But we can't pick just any altcoin and assume it will act bullishly. We must judge the structure of any chart in which we are interested. In light of this perspective, I have chosen three altcoins for your consideration: IMX, GMX, and RPL.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH | IMX,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | TRADING | IMX,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4600178-three-altcoins-to-consider-in-2023?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12369335.jpeg

The crackdown has increased pressure on crypto firms, JPMorgan said, but more importantly there is still no clarity on important issues such as ether’s (ETH) status as a security, which will ultimately impact the cryptocurrency’s demand and liquidity.  The regulatory clampdown has also “deterred institutional investors from engaging with crypto,” and because of this investors have been buying gold rather than bitcoin (BTC) as a hedge against a potential “catastrophic scenario” in the wake of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the note said.  Bitcoin’s rally this year appears to have been driven by retail buying rather than institutional investors, the bank said. The largest cryptocurrency has gained 76% year-to-date.  Another catalyst for bitcoin’s outperformance has been Bitcoin Ordinals, the report added. Ordinals is a new protocol that allows non-fungible-tokens (NFTs) to be stored on the Bitcoin blockchain.

42420562,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqFm1,1683285708,Bitcoin Chalks Out 'Head and Shoulders' Pattern Ahead of U.S. Nonfarm Payrolls: Valkyrie Investments,"Analysts at alternative asset management firm Valkyrie Investments are closely monitoring what looks like a bearish head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern on bitcoin's (BTC) daily chart.  The popular technical analysis pattern is characterized by two rallies or shoulders flanking a bigger one, representing the head. Chart analysts see it as a sign of an impending bullish-to-bearish shift in the market trend, with traders often taking bearish bets once prices drop under the trendline connecting the first and second troughs.  ""High timeframe trend metrics remain firmly bullish, a near-term [bearish] reversal chart pattern has emerged. Although not classically meeting the textbook criteria of a head and shoulders, price action since March 19 has painted an extreme high with flanking lower highs,"" Valkyrie's analysts, led by Chief Investment Officer Steven McClurg, wrote in a note to clients early this week.  ""If price breaches below the neckline, a suggested target zone of $24,000 is possible based on the measured depth of the pattern extended below the neckline,"" the note added.  A UTC close under the neckline support at around $27,300 would confirm a H&S breakdown, opening the doors for a deeper decline.  While a graphical representation of price action in the form of lines or candlesticks helps illustrate psychology, the patterns are a subjective form of analysis and often do not work as intended. In other words, a breakdown of the head and shoulders may not always lead to a more profound price drop and can trap traders on the wrong side of the market.  Macroeconomic developments can make or break trends and invalidate patterns. In other words, bitcoin may rally, invalidating the H&S if Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls data signal labor market weakness. That would strengthen the case for the Federal Reserve (Fed) to pivot in favor of liquidity-boosting interest rate cuts.  Early this week, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell opened the doors for a potential pause in the rate hike cycle, but, at the same time, stressed that the next move depends largely on the incoming data. The Fed has raised rates by 500 basis points (or 5%) since March 2022 – the tightening cycle aimed at controlling inflation roiled cryptocurrencies last year.  According to a Reuters estimate sourced from FXStreet, the data due at 12:30 UTC is likely to show the economy added 179,000 jobs in April following a better-than-expected 236,000 additions in March. The unemployment rate likely held steady at 3.5%. The average hourly earnings are forecast to have risen 0.3% month-on-month and 4.2% year-on-year, matching March's pace.  The odds of bitcoin witnessing a head-and-shoulders breakdown soon will increase if the wage growth and payrolls figure blows past expectations, putting a bid under the heavily shorted U.S. dollar.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/05/bitcoin-faces-downside-risks-on-head-and-shoulders-pattern-us-nonfarm-payrolls-eyed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/16b29e51d16b8a57e68299517769eb93edeab495-1920x801.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
12368623,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=530036,1683285609,Arbitrum (ARB): Is A Major Price Rally Coming Now?,"Ethereum’s layer-2 blockchain Arbitrum is facing a pivotal moment: will it break out of the descending triangle (in the 4-hour chart) or will it see an even deeper correction in the coming days. As NewsBTC reported, Arbitrum’s on-chain data remains extremely strong and could signal an end to the downtrend. However, an important question will also be whether investors regain confidence in altcoins (except PEPE). Bitcoin dominance has been on the rise again against altcoins since May 1, approaching the local high of 49%. Once confidence returns, ARB could benefit greatly. But if not, another plunge could be next. Arbitrum Price Analysis Arbitrum’s price corrected sharply in the last two trading weeks after reaching an all-time high of $1.81 on April 23. It was only in the area of the old breakout zone at $1.30 that the ARB price found a floor after a 30% price decline. Now, this price level is also the frontier in the 4 hours, which bulls should defend at all costs. It is the support line in a descending triangle pattern that has been forming over the past two weeks. The descending triangle is a bearish pattern that anticipates a breakdown to the downside. In order to invalidate the chart pattern, the ARB price must break the resistance line to the upside in the next few days. The support line was defended by the buy side several times recently. However, now is the time to make the breakout to the upside. Related Reading: Arbitrum (ARB) Price Displays Strength, Backed By On-Chain Activity However, the ARB price must overcome not only the ascending trendline, but also the 50-EMA (orange) and the 200-EMA (blue) in the 4-hour chart. Otherwise, a plunge towards the support at $1.20 can be expected. The RSI is trending downwards in the 4-hour chart and was at 42 at press time. A further price drop could generate a sell signal. In the daily chart, the RSI is showing a weakness and is hovering around the lower edge of the neutral zone. Bullish Scenario For ARB In a bullish scenario, Arbitrum manages to break out of the descending triangle pattern to the upside, initiating a rally to the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $1.4071. Major selling pressure is expected at this point. If the buy side succeeds in breaking above this resistance, the focus shifts to the heavy resistance zone at $1.48 (38.2% Fibonacci). The ARB price already failed here in two attempts at the end of April. Related Reading: Bullish Momentum Expected For ARB As Arbitrum Completes DAO Airdrop However, if the buy side can also crush this resistance, a subsequent rise to $1.6122 (61.8% Fibonacci) is possible. If Arbitrum also breaks through this price hurdle in the coming weeks, a retest of the previous month’s high at $1.82 seems more than likely.

Scaling Cardano Using Hydra Heads According to Cardano documentation, Hydra Head will be the first in a suite of protocols that will help the smart contracting platform further process more transactions. This is vital considering Cardano’s gradual enhancement of its mainnet to eventually handle enterprise-grade DApps demanding higher throughput. Observers note that the release of the first layer-2 Hydra Head is a milestone in the current Basho State in Cardano, where scaling and network enhancement is a priority. Hydra is a family of layer 2 protocols designed to make #Cardano more scalable and adaptable for various use cases that require fast and cheap transactions. The first Hydra head recently opened on mainnet. This video is a great starting point for exploring the current release,… pic.twitter.com/g1moYifGNj — Input Output (@InputOutputHK) May 4, 2023 The Hydra Head, now live on mainnet, provides what platform developers describe as a “secure isomorphic state channel” that works off-chain, connecting participants. Notably, transactions sent within a Head are settled instantly. Hydra uses the same architecture as the Bitcoin Lightning Network (LN) that also uses channels. Like the LN, those keen on using the Hydra Head must first deposit funds. Researchers said these Heads could be connected in the future, effectively forming a network. While this development is bullish in the long term, ADA prices are falling when writing in early May 2023. This could be because though Cardano promises to surpass Ethereum as the home of DApps, offering better scaling and decentralization, activity is still relatively low.

At the same time, CoinMarketCap data shows a sharp contraction in trading volumes. To illustrate, ADA’s trading volumes in the previous 24 hours stand at $163,490,485, down 36%.

These developments suggest that Cardano’s growth on the development front is likely to continue, which could lead to further TVL growth in the future. ADA’s Usage And Popularity Among Whales Cardano’s current price on Coingecko is recorded as $0.391593. Although it experienced a 1.1% slump in the past 24 hours and a 4.4% decrease in the past seven days, recent data indicates increased network usage. The number of daily active addresses spiked recently, and the staking market cap of Cardano was recorded as $9,037,199,931. The number of ADA stakers remained relatively stable despite the slump in price. However, the number of token holders has declined, reflecting a dent in investor confidence. On the other hand, the popularity of ADA among whales is high, which is evident from the consistent number of whale transaction counts. Despite the recent decline in price, Cardano’s growing network usage and popularity among whales could be indicative of a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency in the future.

Pepe is a recent example of a meme coin that has seen an incredible surge in price since its launch on April 14, with a price increase of nearly 38,900%.

42420555,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqFfp,1683267513,Pepecoin Short Sellers Lose Millions as PEPE Nears $1B Valuation,"The nascent meme coin pepecoin (PEPE) is the token that keeps on giving, at least so far, surging to an almost $1 billion market capitalization just weeks after its birth.  The tokens have run from strength to strength in the past week even as skeptics warned of an impending collapse, gaining some 500% in the past two weeks as per CoinGecko data.  These warnings centered around the apparent number of whales – or entities who hold large amounts of any token – who purchased PEPE in the hours after it was first issued in mid-April.  That has led to short interest booming among futures traders, as CoinDesk reported. Shorts refer to bets against a token’s price.  Funding rates in perpetual futures tied to the token remain negative, indicating the dominance of bearish positions in the derivatives market. A negative funding rate indicates that shorts are dominant and are willing to pay longs to keep their bearish bets open.  An 80% price bump in the past 24 hours has led to outsized losses for these traders, however. CoinGlass data shows shorts against PEPE lost at least $11 million on several exchanges over the past 24 hours – with traders losing $5.5 million on crypto exchange OKX alone, the highest figure among counterparts.  Traders lost another $2.2 million on Huobi, some $3.6 million on Bybit, and a few hundred thousand dollars on BitMEX. All these exchanges started offering PEPE futures trading in the past week.  PEPE losses were third to only bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) futures liquidations, which usually rack up the highest futures losses.  Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  Large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a steep price move, which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly.",POSITIVE,BTC | PEPE,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | PEPE,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/05/pepe-coin-shorters-lose-millions-as-pepe-jumps-to-900m-valuation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/37e518dbcb7c8bc037450601b2497f9d98a1edc8-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420552,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqFbh,1683251102,Israel Has Seized 190 Binance Accounts With Alleged Terrorist Ties Since 2021: Reuters,"Israeli authorities have seized roughly 190 Binance accounts with alleged ties to terrorist groups such as Hamas and Daesh since 2021, Reuters reported Thursday.  The report cites never-before-published documents from Israel's National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing (NBCTF), a counter-terrorism division of the Israeli Defense Ministry.  According to those documents, the NBCTF confiscated in January an undisclosed amount of crypto from two accounts with alleged links to Daesh, a terrorist group based in Syria and Iraq. Other government records, dating as far back as 2021, allege more than 100 of the seized Binance accounts had ties to Hamas, an armed Palestinian group that has often clashed with the Israeli Defense Forces.  Israeli authorities seized the funds to ""thwart the activity"" of Daesh and ""impair its ability to further its goals,"" the NBCTF said on its website.  The NBCTF did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.  Israeli law permits the country's defense minister to order the confiscation of terrorist-affiliated assets, as determined by the Israeli ministry.  Anti-Money laundering missteps  Binance came under fire last year for policies that critics say encouraged the exchange’s users to flout its money laundering controls. Since 2017, the exchange has processed more than $10 billion in payments executed by criminal enterprises and other bad actors attempting to circumvent U.S. sanctions, Reuters reported.  Binance says it complies with all regulators to ensure its platform is not accessible to terrorist and other nefarious actors. It also said that it must go through a long process to determine whether an individual account actually has clear ties to any criminal organizations.  ""With regard to the specific organizations mentioned in the article, it’s important to clarify that bad actors don’t register accounts under the names of their criminal enterprises,” the company said Thursday in a public response to the Reuters report. “This is why our team collaborates with law enforcement, and leverages information that is only available to them in order to identify individuals operating accounts for illicit organizations.”  The exchange has a 700-member compliance team that processes 1,300 law enforcement requests on a weekly basis,"" Binance VP of Global Intelligence and Investigations Tigran Gambaryan told CoinDesk at Consensus 2023 in April.  Daesh resurgence  Daesh has seen a resurgence in southern Syria since last year, according to the Middle East Institute.  The once-sprawling caliphate controlled between 100,000 and 110,000 sq. kilometers of land across Syria and Iraq at its peak in late 2014. That area shrank to roughly 4,000 sq. kilometers after a series of armed conflicts with American and other military groups forced the group to retreat. Daesh abandoned its last stronghold in Baghuz, Syria in 2019.

As the East begins its trading day, crypto is confused.  Bitcoin is down 0.5% to $28,869 and ether is down 1.45% to $1,878. Meanwhile, the frog-themed PEPE coin is up almost 80% in the last 24 hours, though we’ll see how long that lasts as clouds of a bear sentiment are forming over the frog coin.  Nobody can make much sense of this market. CryptoQuant data says that there’s both high selling pressure because of an uptick in exchange reserves. But at the same time, there’s both a high Coinbase premium and a high Korean premium indicating a lot of buying pressure.  Meanwhile, over in the world of macroeconomic signals, China’s economy looks like it's slowing down.  Thursday's (Asia time) release of the Caixin China General Manufacturing PMI, which measures the performance of the manufacturing sector, showed things dropping – but not looking grim.  Caixin’s PMI metric fell to 49.5 in April 2022, marking the first contraction in factory activity since January due to a property downturn and global slowdown fears. Input prices decreased for the first time in seven months, causing the steepest drop in selling prices since December 2015 as firms sought to attract new business, according to a release.  Singapore’s QCP said in a recent note that the market is “confused and rangy” because it's caught between two minds.  “This lack of direction has led to an absolute crushing of implied volatility across asset classes,” QCP wrote on Telegram.  Conflicting narratives of a hawkish Fed and strong employment with sticky inflation are holding back breaking to new highs, while positioning in the USD is heavily skewed to the short side, the trading firm wrote.  Friday’s job numbers will likely be a good test as to what side of the narrative equation wins.

Fireband Florida Governor, and possible Republican presidential candidate, Ron DeSantis has taken a stand on all of these in the state legislature. Whether you agree with him or not, his tenure as governor is helping to define the next federal election narrative.  But what issue has gotten his office the most phone calls? Central bank digital currencies (CBDC), Samuel Armes, president of the Florida Blockchain Business Association, told CoinDesk.  ""If CBDCs are the encroachment on our civil liberties that the majority of people believe they are, we don't have time to wait,” Armes said. “At the end of the day, if the feds want something, they're going to try to get it. So it's our job to try and stop it.”  As CoinDesk has previously reported, CBDCs are unexpectantly becoming an election issue.  Armes and the Florida Blockchain Business Association helped draft the anti-CBDC bill, which recently passed Florida’s Senate.  As of now, the U.S. has no concrete plans to issue a CBDC. China continues its nationwide rollout of its CBDC, the eCNY, which as of January is 0.13% of the total circulation of the Chinese renminbi yuan. While many nations are researching CBDCs, aside from China, only the Bahamas sand dollar and the Bank of Jamaica’s JAM-DEX are deployed.  Republicans argue that a CBDC would give the government too much control. Armes notes that many who have immigrated to Florida from authoritarian states such as Cuba and Venezuela are horrified by the idea, as it reminds them of what they fled.  Not money in Florida  Florida’s bill declares that CBDCs will not be recognized by the state as money. Other anti-CBDC bills that are still on the drawing board, or have passed, have taken different approaches, which Armes says is great because there will be “no perfect policy.”  Florida not recognizing CBDCs as money will likely put the state on a warpath with the feds. If a state were to refuse to recognize a specific type of money that has been authorized by the federal government, it could potentially face a lawsuit for interfering with the federal government's constitutional power to regulate this — which it has a monopoly on.  Amers says if the federal government sues Florida, the resulting legal battle would delay the implementation of CBDCs and buy time for states to figure out different strategies to counter them. North Carolina's House of Representatives also voted this week to ban CBDCs.  ""Suing complicates matters, bogging them down in the administrative state to the point that by the time they're implemented, numerous disputes have caused significant delays,"" he told CoinDesk. ""It's going to be a federalism issue, like every other issue.""  CBDCs potentially undermine the autonomy of state-chartered banks and allow the federal government to encroach on state-level rights and regulations, Armes argues, pointing to Caitlin Long and Custodia’s long battle with the federal government, as an example of federal encroachment into the rights of states to charter financial institutions.  ""We've had this dual banking system between the states and the [Federal Reserve] that is really turning into just a federal banking system. And a CBDC is going to solidify that further,"" Armes said.  Lobbyists are ready  Regardless of what happens in Washington, D.C. with CBDCs, DeSantis seems to have touched a sensitive, even if his stance seems counterintuitive. Some might argue that Republicans should support CBDCs as a tool against de-platforming. A CBDC could theoretically allow for a constitutional defense that couldn’t be used against a private company.  All this is a particularly curious issue as, unlike other national debates that have pitted states against Washington, D.C, such as guns and abortion, this one hasn’t materialized yet; it’s currently not on the agenda. But there are well-paid lobbyists at the ready on Capitol Hill for when it gets on the agenda.  In the meantime, the issue continues to poll well for DeSantis.

42420548,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqFZd,1683246025,3% Tax on Crypto Transfers Part of Kenya's Proposed Budget: Bloomberg,"Kenya's Finance Ministry, the National Treasury, has proposed a 3% tax on the transfer of digital assets for the coming budget year, according to a Bloomberg report that cites proposals presented to lawmakers. The nation's budget will be presented on June 8.  Kenya elected William Ruto as its President in 2022 when its regulators had not yet proposed any sort of actual crypto rules. President Ruto was assumed to be more crypto-positive than losing candidate Raila Odinga. Later in 2022, lawmakers considered a bill that would allow for the taxation of crypto exchanges, digital wallets and transactions.  The proposed tax on digital assets appears to be a first without necessarily legitimizing the space, a move that other nations have undertaken in recent times too. Roughly 8.5% of the Kenyan population or 4.25 million people own cryptocurrencies, ranking the nation fifth in the world in global adoption of crypto, according to a report by the United Nations.  The Finance Bill 2023, seen by local news outlet Kenyans.co.ke, defines the term ""digital asset.""  ""Digital asset” includes anything of value that is not tangible and cryptocurrencies, token codes, and numbers held in digital form and generated through cryptographic means or otherwise, by whatever name called, providing a digital representation of value exchanged with or without consideration that can be transferred, stored or exchanged electronically; and a non-fungible token or any other token of similar nature, by whatever name called; and the income derived from transfer or exchange of a digital asset” means the gross fair market value consideration received or receivable at the point of exchange or transfer of a digital asset,"" read part of the Finance Bill 2023, according to Kenyans.co.ke.
