42384129,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0aiz,1594760599,This New Coding Language Could Help Unlock Bitcoin’s Smart Contract Potential,"Bitcoin Core contributor Jeremy Rubin has revealed his work on a new smart-contract language for Bitcoin, which he hopes will increase the ""financial self-sovereignty"" of users.      Rubin demoed the new language, Sapio, on Saturday at a RecklessVR meetup presentation in virtual reality, with many audience members joining the talk in VR headsets. He plans to release the programming language as a part of his new research organization, Judica.      Stateful smart contracts allow users to lock up money so funds can't be spent until certain conditions are met or a series of interactive steps have been taken. These contracts are most commonly associated with the Ethereum blockchain, which is very flexible, making stateful smart contracts easy to write.      Read more: How Do Ethereum Smart Contracts Work?      It's lesser-known though that Bitcoin also supports several different types of more complex smart contracts, such as requiring more than just one person to sign off on a transaction before it can be spent. But compared to Ethereum, Bitcoin smart contracts are much more complicated and unwieldy to create, or they are stateless – that is, the conditions are met either all at once or not at all. Thus far, this has meant that there have been fewer options for developing smart contracts on Bitcoin.      Rubin hopes to further expand the smart contract use cases for Bitcoin to give users even more control over what they can do with their money.    New possibilities for Bitcoin smart contracts    Sapio could work for Bitcoin smart contracts today. But most of the types of smart contracts Rubin envisions aren't available on Bitcoin yet.      He built Sapio specifically around CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY (CTV), a change that, if adopted, could bring more smart contract features to the Bitcoin network, namely allowing users to secure their bitcoin in new ways.      In his talk, Rubin described CTV as a ""a simple covenanting system for bitcoin."" The idea of covenants, which has been around for a long time, is to add security measures, such as baking in extra rules to a batch of bitcoin, preventing the owner of the bitcoin from sending to all but a few addresses.      ""In practice, it means it allows you to do some more complex smart contracting [determining] how bitcoin can be spent when a coin is created,"" Rubin said.      One use case for covenants is bitcoin ""vaults."" Usually once a private key is taken, a malicious actor can scurry away with the associated coins. But locking up your funds in such a vault adds restrictions on the movement of bitcoin in the case of a mistake or another security issue.      ""I think vaults are one of the most important use cases that CTV is going to bring to the table. They bring an immense amount of financial sovereignty tools to a wide audience,"" Rubin said, adding that this technology opens up the opportunity for users to do this by themselves without a third-party service provider.      Read more: The ‘Great Lockdown’ Is Boosting Demand for Bitcoin Custody Solutions      Vaults are currently possible in bitcoin, but could be much easier to create with CTV, Rubin argued.      While Rubin is most excited about vaults, CTV opens up a variety of other use cases, such as congestion control. CTV could help bitcoin users wait out high fees for a time where the blockchain has less transaction traffic, and, as such, lower fees.      Now that Rubin has created Sapio, a smart-contract language specifically for CTV, these use cases will become easier for developers to program and thus, easier for everyday users to implement.    Bitcoin as a 'judiciary'    Rubin's newly born research organization Judica will focus on this bundle of technologies. It plans to release tools it hopes will ""massively expand the Bitcoin economy,"" Rubin told CoinDesk in an email.      The word ""Judica"" is Latin for ""judgment"": Rubin sees Bitcoin as a judiciary, and he wants to push it to grow in this role.      ""If you look at the relationship between the market and the government, usually free-market absolutists will say that the government merely is an interfering agent and will go away. But if you take a closer look, the functionality of the courts is actually critical to the development of the economy. Without reliable courts or some judicial system (private arbitration counts, too), transacting with relative strangers is far too risky which severely limits economic activity.""  Bitcoin comes in and makes this all easier. ""The ability to enforce contacts through a legal system (rather than through personal force) enables an economy to flourish,"" he said.      But he argues Bitcoin is too limited in what it can do today.      ""The Bitcoin blockchain serves the role as a judiciary, but right now the types of contracts it can resolve is fairly limited and it's difficult to develop more advanced contracts,"" Rubin added.      As a part of Judica, Rubin plans to release Sapio ""along with designs for a myriad of smart contracts"" implemented in the smart-contract language. As Judica is still in its early stages, Rubin said he's looking for grants, funds and fellow team members to join in.    Shipping CTV and Sapio    But it's unclear when (and if) CTV will be deployed, Rubin explained in his talk. It's a bigger Bitcoin change, so it might take time before the opcode is usable.      ""I don't know exactly when it's going to happen. I'd like to see it sooner rather than later,"" Rubin said.      Because Bitcoin is decentralized, there is no central authority to make decisions. As such, developers don't always agree about the way forward.      ""If you ask each developer when [CTV will be deployed], you'll get a very different answer,"" Rubin said in his lecture. ""There are a reasonable amount of people who say it's three years from now – at least.""      Rubin has been championing CTV, which, if successfully activated, would add these abilities to Bitcoin. Most changes to Bitcoin – large or small – are implementation details or local policies. However, because CTV changes a global consensus rule, it would be delivered via a ""soft fork,"" even though the actual code changes required for CTV are small. As such, it would require enough network participants to support it in order to activate smoothly. So, Rubin isn't sure when the change will become available.      Read more: Hard Fork vs Soft Fork      Many bitcoin developers are more cautious, only giving their blessings to changes that have been vetted to a certain degree.      But, in Rubin's opinion, a timeline of three years is far too lengthy. He called this timeline ""sad"" and said, ""It's hard for me to make the case that this is important stuff to work on if it's not really usable until at least three years from now.""      ""Some people are, like, 'Ship it and see if we can get it in in six months.' I fall more in that camp,"" he said, suggesting that changes should be made quickly while Bitcoin is still in its early stages and is more malleable. ""I argue that Bitcoin is so early and experimental that we need to be pushing really quickly. Other people feel that Bitcoin is more ossified and needs to move really slowly.""      Rubin thinks that this sort of change is important to Bitcoin's future.      As he said in his presentation, ""We need a lot of new [features], so that when we say ‘Bitcoin fixes this,’ it actually means what we think it does.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | RESEARCH | FORKS,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/07/14/this-new-coding-language-could-help-unlock-bitcoins-smart-contract-potential,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2e34059d68b2c3540206bd6d6db7be28beefee59-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $9,264 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. EDT). gaining 0.43% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $9,099-$9,275  BTC above 10-day and 50-day moving average, a bullish signal for market technicians.    The price of bitcoin is stuck in the $9,200 price range as low volumes continue to plague the markets, said Katie Stockton, an analyst for Fairlead Strategies. “Bitcoin has been tethered to its 50-day moving average recently after having suffered a loss of short-term momentum in June.” Bitcoin’s 50-day moving average is around $9,240 as of Tuesday.      Read More: Bitcoin Volatility Metrics Are Like November 2018 All Over Again      Stockton says anything above that level would be a sign of bullish sentiment. “We would view a decisive move above the 50-day MA as an incremental positive because it would help prevent intermediate-term momentum from turning negative,” she added.      The summer doldrums for the bitcoin market likely started not long after the May 12 halving, said David Lifchitz, chief investment officer for Paris-based quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha.      “Bitcoin has been trading very technical post-halving since mid-May, essentially bouncing into a $8,100-$10,400 band,” Lifchitz said. “Since mid-June, Bitcoin has gone nowhere moving in a very narrow range of $9,000-$9,400,” he added.      Read More: Bitcoin Halving 2020, Explained      Sasha Goldberg, senior trading specialist for crypto firm Efficient Frontier, said markets overall might not be pricing in the long-term economic impacts of the coronavirus yet. “Right now it seems that the markets are disconnected from what’s going globally. I think bitcoin will continue to stay in the range of $8,900-$9,400,” he said.      Still, bitcoin is up almost 30% this year. Sweden-based over-the-counter trader Henrik Kugelberg said economic uncertainty bodes well for bitcoin as investors look for places to sock away money. “People are anticipating a real bad global fall, with the actual toll of the first six months not seen until Q4,” he said. “I believe more and more asset managers are at least shifting some portfolio percentages into bitcoin.”    Uniswap dominating DEXs    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was up Tuesday, trading around $241 after climbing 1.3% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET). For the year, ether is up 75%, and part of that story has been the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi).      The decentralized exchange, or DEX, Uniswap, which has been deployed since late 2018, is seriously taking on early mover advantages. With over $33 million in daily volume, Uniswap is conquering almost 60% of the DeFi market.      Efficient Frontier’s Goldberg said other DEXs rely on Uniswap because of the platform’s diversity of offerings, which helps its volume numbers. “Uniswap has other services like flash loans and they are powering some other DeFi projects,” Goldberg told CoinDesk. “I also believe that some DEX’s are hedging their positions in Uniswap.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly in the green Tuesday.

42384136,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0auJ,1594757953,Cryptocurrencies Have 'No Way' to Comply With US Anti-Encryption Bills,"Multiple bills that threaten encryption are moving through the U.S. Senate and could pose a threat to technology that protects users' privacy, industry pros say.      These bills include the Lawful Access to Encrypted Data (LAED) Act and the Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies (“EARN IT”) Act. While the LAED was only recently introduced to the Senate, the EARN IT act has been in the works for months, and has been amended a number of times.      Privacy advocates and product designers say such legislation would also curtail people’s privacy to a huge degree, fundamentally change existing technology and have an impact on everything from messaging and file sharing to privacy coins.      “The government basically would have mass surveillance powers into all of our communications,“ said Zcoin Project Steward Reuben Yap, referring to the LAED Act. “It’s saying, ‘Let's drop the pretense and let's just go for it.’ I think it’s really scary. It's not just about cryptocurrencies as a whole though, it's really about freedom.”    The bills in question    Sponsored by three Republicans, the LAED Act seeks to end encrypted communications by building in a backdoor for law enforcement to use. The bill lays out a legal framework for law enforcement to access encrypted data with a court order.      The explicit goal of the EARN IT Act is to curb the spread of child exploitative content online, such as child sexual abuse imagery, though its impact could be far wider. In an initial draft, this was going to be done through stripping tech companies of liability protections for the content that is posted on their platforms. These protections currently exist in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which prevents social media companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Reddit from content liability.      Under an earlier draft of the EARN IT Act, companies would lose Section 230 protections if they didn’t follow the recommendations of a federal commission on child exploitative content. This could render companies like WhatsApp, which offers end-to-end encryption, liable for communications on the platform, unless they revoked end-to-end encryption.      ""They communicate using virtually unbreakable encryption. Predators' supposed privacy interests should not outweigh our privacy and security,"" said Attorney General William Barr at an event the day the bill was introduced.    There is no way for Ethereum, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to comply.    Barr has long been a critic of encryption, dating back to his days in the George W. Bush Administration.      The most recent version of the bill gets rid of the commission idea, delegating power to state legislatures to bring lawsuits against companies. It also adds an amendment that explicitly protects encryption. But organizations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), Center for Democracy and Technology and Internet Society claim the bill might respect encryption in name, but not in practice.      Tools like client-side scanning, which could be used to check for child exploitative content, employs software to check files that are being sent against a database of “hashes,” or unique digital fingerprints. If it finds a match to certain kinds of images, they could be blocked, with the recipient notified, or the message could be forwarded to a third party without the user’s knowledge. Organizations such as EFF have said this violates encryption on a fundamental level.      “Tech companies’ increasing reliance on encryption has turned their platforms into a new, lawless playground of criminal activity,” said Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and one of the sponsors (with Sens. Lindsey Graham and Marsha Blackburn) of the LAED, in a public statement.      “Criminals from child predators to terrorists are taking full advantage. This bill will ensure law enforcement can access encrypted material with a warrant based on probable cause and help put an end to the Wild West of crime on the Internet.”      See also: EU's Europol: Bitcoin Privacy Wallet 'Not Looking Good' For Law Enforcement      Child sexual abuse imagery is proliferating at an alarming rate on the internet. In 2019, tech companies reported nearly 70 million pieces of exploitative child content to authorities. Criminals also often use encrypted communications. EncroChat, a encrypted communications platform, protected criminals and their communications from the police, until law enforcement managed to infiltrate it.      But weakening tools that protect everyone’s privacy may not be the best solution, say privacy advocates.    The impact on tech and cryptocurrency    Yap, of Zcoin, said many kinds of technology could be impacted by the bill’s broad sweep.      The LAED Act is aimed at electronic devices and operating systems. Providers of “remote computing services” are included, presumably to cover cloud computing services like Dropbox.      However, Yap said the bill’s definition of remote computing services can be stretched to include cryptocurrencies as well, because financial transactions are conceivably just another form of electronic communication.      “Given the trajectory of this legislation, people in the cryptocurrency industry, especially those like Zcoin [that] are privacy-focused, will very likely be affected,” said Yap.      “It could mean that 'providers' of a privacy cryptocurrency that provided service to more than 1,000,000 users in the US are required to insert a backdoor.”    Privacy is not safe in their hands.    Ian Dixon, a Nevada-based programmer who previously mined bitcoin and runs a validator on a privacy-oriented blockchain network, said the bills are repackaged attacks on privacy, just with different language.      “It doesn’t really seem possible to enforce, but it would essentially make blockchains illegal in general,” said Dixon. “There is no way for ethereum, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to comply.”      Matt Hill, the co-founder of Start9 Labs in Colorado, which develops decentralized internet tech, says he sees both pieces of legislation as falling into the same bucket, even if they are different in flavor.      “The ultimate meaning is the same, which is that if you are a service provider of privacy or encryption, you are going to be subject to the whims of politics,” said Hill.      “We hope politicians and our political system stays rational, and upholds individual rights to privacy, but if they don't you are going to be subjected to force, whether it’s building a backdoor or handing over user data.”      See also: Public Opinion Shifts on Big Tech and Privacy During Pandemic      Hill said that even if these bills don’t pass, the very fact they're sitting on the table and being taken seriously should be enough of a warning sign for us to start thinking outside the political box.      “Privacy is not safe in their hands,” said Hill. “So we have to protect privacy with technology, as opposed to with laws.”      This is privacy-by-design tech, the kind that Start9 Labs develops, including a server that lets users run their own private networks and cut out middlemen who would otherwise have access to their data.      Start9 Lab’s tech is built such that it can’t hand over any user data, even if legally compelled to, because it doesn't have it. It builds the tech but doesn’t run the services on it. Given its products are open source, they can continue to run and protect user privacy, even if the company is shut down.      See also: How Apple's COVID-19 Policy Limited a Public Health App in Taiwan(Opens in a new browser tab)      Encrypted communications are regularly used by people such as dissidents and journalists, and are often a means of protecting sources or organizing in authoritarian countries. There is a risk that if the U.S., which has long held itself up as an example of freedom and democracy, moves to eliminate end-to-end encryption, other countries would also follow suit, and use such legislation to crack down on dissent.      Finally, backdoors inevitably get used by bad guys, not just law enforcement.      “There's no such thing as a backdoor just for good guys,” said Daisy Soderberg-Rivkin, a fellow focusing on children and technology at the R Street Institute, a policy think tank in Washington, D.C. “This opens up users' information to a whole mess of bad actors.”      UPDATE: The section about the EARN IT Act's potential impact on services like WhatsApp has been updated.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/07/14/cryptocurrencies-have-no-way-to-comply-with-us-anti-encryption-bills,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2d252dcc75d690befc46a83cddba0959f3d67790-1293x898.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Jesse Walden, who focused on blockchain investments at a16z, announced his Variant Fund in a blog post published Tuesday.      Walden said the new fund is focused on the idea that the people who make platforms and products strong can share in their growth. He wrote:    ""Crypto exposed the power of ownership as a tool to drive users to contribute to protocols they use in deeper ways. Now, the opportunity is to follow the pattern, and build more accessible products (and protocols) that bootstrap adoption & participation through better economic alignment with users.""    He cites examples like Compound, which is distributing a large portion of its governance tokens to users; Reddit, which is starting to sort out how tokens fit into the Web 2.0 giant's business model, and other examples.      In an email to CoinDesk, Walden said the fund is backed by a16z's Chris Dixon and Marc Andreessen, Union Square Ventures and Compound's Robert Leshner – ""mentors I respect and have built relationships with over the years as both an entrepreneur and investor.""      Variant Fund has made investments already, Walden said, but they've yet to be announced.    Founder's roots    Walden co-founded Mediachain, an a16z-backed blockchain startup that tracked ownership rights of online images and other intellectual property. After the firm was acquired by Spotify in 2017, Walden worked for the music-streaming giant for nine months before decamping to a16z.      ""To help build the ownership economy, I'll partner with entrepreneurs and communities at the earliest possible stages,"" Walden wrote.      Read more: Mediachain is Using Blockchain to Create a Global Rights Database      Longtime political watchers might draw a connection between the ""ownership economy"" thesis and former President George W. Bush's ""ownership society"" messaging.      In 2003, the president bemoaned a past where only a very few held equity in major companies, celebrating a present where it was possible for almost anyone to hold a share.      What President Bush probably didn't anticipate at that time was a future where people could own a company that exists only on the web and, like Bitcoin, has no one in particular in charge. As Walden described in another blog post from January, Variant appears built to help founders head in that direction.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/07/14/this-a16z-alum-is-launching-a-vc-fund-focused-on-platforms-you-can-own,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a919fb07c504186f04a6c8cbcf7ecb325e85d346-1800x1200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42384138,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0ay5,1594749759,Charlie Shrem TLDL: Ray Youssef and Crypto’s Role in Africa,"Crypto luminary Charlie Shrem is joined by Ray Youssef of Paxful for a wide-ranging conversation on Youssef’s work building schools in Africa, Paxful’s mission to unite the continent through financial inclusion and crypto’s role in revolution.      This conversation has been abridged and adapted from Shrem’s Untold Stories podcast, found here. Here are the highlights, fit for print, of their hour-long conversation.    On motivation    Youssef: I remember it was 2005 after Hurricane Katrina, I saw this picture of this American lady who didn't even have shoes. She had to make her shoes from garbage and cardboard. I said this is shameful. How can we support this in a civilized country? So I took my bags, went to New Orleans. I got there the first day they were letting people back in and walked into a ghost town.      I asked FEMA, the Salvation Army, Red Cross, everyone, trying to find people that could help. But no one knew a damn thing, it was the most disorganized effort you can imagine. No one knew anything except for five Dominican nuns I met. We helped rebuild the first school to open up in Old City, the New Orleans Cathedral Academy.      See also: From Ghana to the Bronx, These Teen Bitcoiners Are Building the Future      After we reopened the first school, the police and fire department could come back and that was like the official rebirth of the city. I looked at that and I was like, ""Wow, one school can make a difference."" It stayed with me for a long time. Then, when we were in Africa I [had an epiphany]. It all started from there.    On crypto’s role in Africa    So our top route is China to Nigeria. We created that trade route four years ago and it was absolutely integral to actually solving the problems [we saw] when we landed in Africa. [When I said] bitcoin can help them, everyone said I was crazy because there's no way people making $2 a day are going to invest in bitcoin.      That statement is true, but there's a lot of people in Africa who make a lot more than $2 a day. They're young, they're hungry, upwardly mobile and they're not using bitcoin as a form of investment. They're using it as a medium of exchange, and that is the narrative that we bring to the people. And they get it completely. They taught us everything about what bitcoin is actually good for.    It's amazing what these young African entrepreneurs come up with if you give them an open-ended system.    Our mission at Paxful is to generate wealth, we want to make our users wealthy. We want to create wealth everywhere we go because that's what financial liberation is all about. Africans have money; they just can't use it. It’s easier for them to actually transport their physical bodies than it is for them to move their own money.      The truth is, the banking network charges an invisible tax upon nations. If you're trying to move $10 million from Nigeria to Germany, the banks there will be like, ""Ah, we already took $10 million from this bank in this country two months ago, we can't put another one through."" They don't [always] accept the money that comes in.      See also: Why Binance and Akon Are Betting on Africa for Crypto Adoption      Every single bank in the world has their own standards. It is the most fractionalized, balkanized, messed up and downright – in a lot of ways – racist [system]. Because it's a blanket tax put on an entire continent, and these people are basically excluded from the monetary system. Bitcoin solves this.    On the Pax Africana    We call our 20-year plan Pax Africana, which is to connect the entire country intercontinentally. Number one … there must be seamless settlement with the network when you send money from one African country to another. Paxful already supports gift cards, online wallets, bank transfers. We have commissions with over 100 African payment methods and are set to add over another 100 African payment methods soon.      Number two, water. Number three, education. … That's the trifecta of civilization, so we're building these dams and wells across Africa. We built our first school in Rwanda. We let other people from the surrounding district come in and get water there and [are trying to] make this sustainable by charging a fraction of a penny for [a jug] of water, which is a huge deal for them. It's sustainable and it's changing the lives of people.      For example, one young boy got up and said, thank you so much for this well, I can go to school now. He spent six hours of his day fetching water for his family. Imagine having one of those wells in every district across Africa? We’d [contribute] an enormous sum to the African GDP by freeing up their eldest child's time, allowing them to go to school. That's the kind of power that we can have for people.      [People are saying] like, 'Hey, I built my own little version of Western Union on Paxful' and I focus on South Africa to Nigeria. It's amazing what these young African entrepreneurs come up with if you give them an open-ended system. It's why I say Africa's going to rule the world, because there's an army of these young people that are so brilliant, it's amazing.    On civil rights protests    I'm not a political guy, I try to keep my nose out of that. Every time humanity is about to embark upon a golden age, things happen to slow it down and they happen in different ways in different places. I would caution everyone in the United States to not be reactionary, do not join the process, sit down and think about order. Do not react to the things that are happening now…      See also: Michael Casey – Money Reimagined: The Ongoing Crisis Is Stirring a Crypto Awakening in Developing Nations      I would encourage you to keep a cool head, do not be reactive, use the time to get to your spiritual core. This could turn into an orange revolution very quickly and that could be the destruction of the United States. As a proud American patriot, I really do pray every day that does not happen. Sometimes, to take a real stand you don't have to do anything.    On the African franc    I was shocked and horrified to figure out a few years ago that the African franc is about as African as the Federal Reserve is. All the African francs are printed in Paris and the African countries have to actually pay the French for the right to use the money.      See also: Hyperinflation and Zimbabwe’s Multi-Currency Reality: Bitcoin in Africa Podcast, Part 2      The African franc is a monstrosity that has completely kept 14 economies balkanized and unable to grow. This is modern-day colonialism, modern-day slavery. I talked to some people who run these countries and they're disgusted by it. They say, ""It's kept our country basically in chains for the past 80 years. Why can't we change it?""      [Eventually we will see] young people starting their businesses, working around all these financial limitations, keeping significant chunks of their savings and earnings not in their local currencies, but in Bitcoin or cryptocurrency. Then these guys that have their bank accounts stuck in Paris might start to think, ""If all these young people are doing it this way, maybe I can do it this way, too.""",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Charlie Shrem,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/14/charlie-shrem-tldl-ray-youssef-and-cryptos-role-in-africa,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3801c34c7018086e49bd5cde6bd677838d5b57fb-2778x1552.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384125,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0ahj,1594747553,What It's Really Like to Live on Bitcoin in the Middle East,"Syrian developer Ghass Mo has been living off freelance bitcoin gigs from Kurdistan, Iraq, for nearly two years.      ""I get paid in bitcoin for doing work on open-source projects related to the cryptocurrency industry,"" Mo said. “The first programmer I met was Amir Taaki. … I learned a lot from him and he was supporting me.”      It’s impossible to say how many people are like Mo, inspired by a chance meeting with a bitcoiner to embark on an educational journey toward financial sovereignty. These cases are often isolated, at least in the developing world. Yet, they are increasingly familiar to people who work with digital nomads. They are showing bitcoin can work as intended, as a global currency without borders.      Read more: Bitcoin in Emerging Markets: The Middle East      Mo left Syria in his early 20s because of the civil war and became an unbanked migrant worker to support his family. This may sound bleak but Mo has a lot in common with the other developers he now works with online.      He is a quiet man, a self-taught developer who rarely leaves his chosen Batcave except for shopping and rare outings. Mo has a perpetual five o’clock shadow and a minimalist home office setup, with just a few laptops, a monitor and always a cup of Arabic coffee. He's never met most of the people he works with online, nor does he know of any local bitcoin meetups. He spends his evenings reading about Rust and studying at home with books like “Mastering Bitcoin.”      “The ongoing war in Syria and lack of stability affected me,” he said. “Sometimes I spend months trying to finish an online course, translating every single word [from English]. … The people [I know] interested in this field of study could be counted on one hand.”    Getting by    Like many other freelance developers earning bitcoin across the Middle East, Mo liquidates his bitcoin through a local exchange to pay for daily expenses. A local grad student who founded the Kurdcoin exchange, Abdurrahman Bapir, has been operating a hawala-adjacent business for customers like Mo since 2017.      Hawala is a traditional money network used to send value across the Islamic world for hundreds of years, long before bitcoin. Thanks to partnerships with long-standing hawala businesses, bitcoin has merely become another option offered by such money changers. This is very accessible to local people with a wide range of computer skills and access.      “Facebook is our primary source for discovery for new clients. Word of mouth is the second,” said Bapir. “We also sell hardware wallets ourselves. We recently started this service, we’ve sold 10 in Iraq, and it’s increasing.”      Read more: How Bitcoin Fits Into Lebanon’s Banking Crisis      Mo and users like him can message the Kurdcoin accounts on social media, including Telegram, Twitter or Instagram. The exchange is supported by a staff of 10 people. Clients can pay online with bitcoin and pick up their cash at almost any local hawala business from Syria to Kurdish Iran. Mo also uses bitcoin to send money to his family.    It was a great feeling when I realized I could buy food and other stuff using bitcoin.    “After the lockdown, due to the coronavirus, the borders between Iraqi Kurdistan and Rojava [Syria] have been closed,” Mo said. “Sometimes there are difficulties in transferring money and the fees increase several times.”      Local demand is much higher now, Bapir said, for the bitcoin that freelancers like Mo bring to the local market.    Kurdish markets    ""We’ve had some months where we did $10 million in volume and months with $500,000,"" Bapir said of Kurdcoin’s volumes.      Plus, business is up compared to the token-boom peak of late 2017.      “There are many, many new customers coming,” Bapir said. “There are 10-20 new leads for our exchange every day … some months we'll have 1,000 prospective clients.”      Token fans have long since abandoned the unaffiliated token sale that once shared the exchange’s name. Many people weren’t as lucky as Mo, to learn about bitcoin from a trusted mentor. Those who learned from token “scams,” Bapir said, are now returning to his platform for bitcoin.      Read more: Despite Bitcoin Price Dips, Crypto Is a Safe Haven in the Middle East      Bapir said he’s working with a team of lawyers and 10 advisers from abroad to try to establish a regulated way to conduct business in Kurdistan. Much like the American cannabis industry operates in a gray zone between state and federal laws, the Kurdish bitcoin industry operates despite vague restrictions issued by the Central Bank of Iraq. In the meantime, established hawala businesses handle the know-your-customer (KYC) process.    Loyal users    It’s been lucky that bitcoiners like Mo remain regular customers during the pandemic.      Before the coronavirus crisis, Bapir said more than half of his clients were from the southern, Arab regions of Iraq. They came to Northern Iraq (Kurdistan) to buy or sell bitcoin. Now, with travel restricted, such business is done online. Multi-currency remittances have picked up due to the lockdown and both Iranian and Syrian currencies collapsing.      “From the West of Iran, the Kurdish part, some people were also thinking of opening a Kurdish exchange,” Bapir said about growing demand for bitcoin. “Banking here is underdeveloped in Iraq, probably one in 20 people has a bank account they actually use. … Almost all of our daily transactions are in cash. You buy a house with cash.”      This cash economy suits unbanked migrants like Mo, who still manages to get enough freelance work to support himself and live comfortably in Iraq. Although electricity and WiFi access is reliable in Iraq, a vast improvement over Syria, he's still unable to run or use local data centers.      ""I rely on providers abroad,"" Mo said. “I’ve had to work several part-time jobs as a graphic designer and web developer to provide financial support for my family. … I’ve finished 10 online courses at Edx, four at Udemy and read more than 10 books about programming and bitcoin.”      He said learning about bitcoin dramatically changed his life over the past two years.      “It was a great feeling when I realized I could buy food and other stuff using bitcoin,” he added.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/14/what-its-really-like-to-live-on-bitcoin-in-the-middle-east,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3f933b496908a807a131327a397ac1f3caddb285-1500x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Joshua Thomas Argires received a $956,600 loan for “Texas Barbecue” and allegedly transferred those funds into a Coinbase account where they “generated a profit” by investing in crypto, according to a criminal complaint unsealed Monday in U.S District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The complaint didn’t disclose the size of the alleged profit or which cryptocurrencies were allegedly traded.  USPS investigators discovered Texas Barbecue had no documented employees, no online reviews and no bank account until four days prior to the loan request, according to a criminal complaint.  Argires suggested that Texas Barbecue’s Coinbase account was how employees were paid, saying: “I don’t really manage that aspect of” the business. Investigators assert Argires had exclusive control of the Coinbase account and Texas Barbecue never had any employees to pay.  Charges against Argires, who allegedly collected more than $1.1 million in fraudulent PPP loans total, include wire fraud, making false statements to a financial institution, bank fraud and engaging in prohibited monetary transfers.  In addition for his Texas Barbecue loan, Argires also received PPP funds for a company called Houston Landscaping, which also had no employees, the complaint reads. The funds obtained for Houston Landscaping were not deposited in Coinbase but were held in a bank account and depleted by ATM withdrawals, according to the complaint.  PPP records indicate a ""Texas Barbecue"" with identical information to Argires' outfit received a loan from PrimeWay Federal Credit Union in Houston.

A score of 100 indicates it is the maximum number of searches observed for a term during a given time frame.      Ethereum Reboot Ethereum developers are aspiring to launch Eth 2.0 in 2020. The sum of account balances maintained by the network’s nodes – called the state – continues to grow larger and larger as applications and projects transact. Adoption is good, but runaway growth is bad. Independent developer Alexey Akhunov may have a solution – one pulled from Cosmos, the interoperability blockchain. His new proposal, dubbed “ReGenesis,” posted on EthResearch on June 24, would bring stateless client research to the current Ethereum chain (also known as Eth 1.x) by “nuking” certain nodes’ states and swapping them with a math proof on a rolling basis.      CBDCs The U.K.’s central bank is discussing the possibility of launching a digital currency. Speaking during an online event, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey told a group of U.K. students on Monday his institution was having talks over the plan, as reported by Bloomberg Tuesday. Bailey said ongoing investigations would look at a central bank digital currency (CBDC), which would have implications across ""payments and society."" Calling it a ""very big issue,"" he anticipated the CBDC could be a real possibility in several years, once the coronavirus has passed.    Quick bites  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s half-brother was paid by the federal government to speak at a blockchain conference last year.  What do Ethereum developers do when there’s no conferences to attend?  Paradigm is sponsoring a Bitcoin Core developer. (The Block)  Bitcoin environmental impact grows following post-halving dip. (Decrypt)  Tax Day    The deadline to file and pay your taxes in the U.S. is tomorrow, and hodlers are as confused as ever.      CoinDesk’s Nikhilesh De looks into how the Internal Revenue Service’s public guidance on crypto tax reporting fails to account for much of the innovative financial tools enabled by decentralized tech. Passive income earned through staking, highly leveraged margin trading and crypto earned through airdrops or hardforks all have antecedents, but retail investors taking advantage of these products are still in the dark about they have to do. That’s because the IRS hasn’t clarified the precise tax implications or forms associated with these services, tax pros say.      “What the IRS has made clear is taxpayers need to file if they made (or lost) any money as a result of exchanging their crypto for fiat or another cryptocurrency, if they gained any crypto as a result of airdrops or hard forks, or if they gained funds as a result of staking or mining,” De writes.      “Sometimes the IRS publishes final regulations more than a decade after taxpayers wish they were available. But it does make for unpredictable outcomes and forces individuals and businesses to file more in hope than expectation that they’ve acted correctly,” Kirk Phillips, a certified public accountant and author of “The Ultimate Bitcoin Business Guide: For Entrepreneurs & Business Advisors,” wrote in an op-ed.      While the IRS is working to create a guide for tax obligations, Phillips notes historically much “de facto tax guidance” comes from audits and tax court. There’s an irony in this as one public advocate, the IRS’s own Taxpayer Advocate Service, now claims a letter sent to crypto holders last summer may have violated taxpayers’ right to privacy and the right to be informed.      Another irony: Despite Bitcoin’s initial anti-state ideological underpinnings, the current tax landscape is likely one of the biggest barriers to mainstream adoption today.    Market intel    Volatility Bands Bitcoin’s ongoing low-volatility range play is reminiscent of the price doldrums observed ahead of a sudden 40% price crash in the second half of November 2018. This time, however, the price squeeze may end with a bullish move, as the spread between volatility bands and the 20-day moving average suggests. “A prolonged period of low volatility consolidation often ends with a violent move in either direction,” CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole notes. But the macroeconomic climate – seen by monetary and fiscal stimulus and Bitcoin’s tripling from March lows – could precede a strong move to the higher side.      It Hit An index of 50 low-capitalization cryptocurrencies, the so-called Shitcoin Index, is up 114% so far this year. Launched in 2019 by FTX, the index was trading at an all-time high of $1,065 Monday after making all-time highs for the past three consecutive trading days. The novel futures product has outperformed bitcoin by 88 percentage points this year.    Opinion    Minecraft of Finance Camila Russo, founder of The Defiant and author of “The Infinite Machine,” the first book on the history of Ethereum, out today, thinks Ethereum has achieved much of what it set out to do five years ago: become a “Minecraft of crypto-finance.” From token issuance to decentralized exchanges through to novel derivatives platforms, Ethereum is the base layer to an alternative and open financial system. “The next five years will be about strengthening these scaling solutions and making these financial applications more robust and secure,” she predicts. You can read an excerpt of her new book here:    Podcast    The Real Story Behind Tesla’s Crazy Rally Elon Musk is now richer than Warren Buffett and Tesla comprises more than 25% of the value of the entire auto market. In the latest episode of The Breakdown, NLW looks at the narratives behind this stock-market phenomenon including Musk’s cult of personality, the Robinhood effect and whether Tesla is a tech company.

On Tuesday, the regulated U.S.-based company, founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, said supporting hardware security keys will allow users to authenticate their Gemini accounts through a cryptographic proof of a user's identity.  Users are now able to use their mobile devices to sign in via USB and near-field communication (NFC) security keys.  Mobile devices will authenticate via an internet standard known as Web Authentication (WebAuthn), a type of security interface designed for validating multiple users of internet applications using public-key cryptography.  The extra feature is in addition to Gemini's current security layers including TouchID and Windows Hello.  According to the firm, only owners of the physical hardware key may gain access to their accounts, even if their passwords are compromised or in the event they fall victim to a SIM-swap attack.  The new security stems from a partnership between Gemini and Yubico via its Works With Yubikey program.  Yubikey's hardware can be utilized cross-platform via Gemini's mobile app as an additional layer of defense.  In order to take full advantage of the keys, the companies said a user will need to register at least two hardware keys, including one that is supported by the user's mobile device.  Gemini recently became the first exchange to integrate with Samsung's blockchain wallet, allowing Canadians and U.S.-based citizens to buy and sell crypto through Gemini's mobile app.    See also: Israeli Firm Develops Tech Allowing Crypto Users to Retrieve Funds Sent in Error",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/14/gemini-boosts-user-security-with-hardware-security-key-support-for-android-and-ios,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

The storage will be offered on Kingdom Trust’s Choice retirement account, a hybrid self-service retirement platform where investors can buy, sell or hold stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and digital assets in one tax-advantaged account.      Kingdom Trust CEO Ryan Radloff hopes the partnership with Fidelity will nudge the investment giant closer to serving retail crypto investors.      “I think having Fidelity grow is so important for bitcoin and the market’s maturity that I’m willing to sacrifice a few basis points of margin for that,” Radloff said of the new business arrangement. “We think this is meaningful for a lot of people that already have Fidelity retirement accounts but have really been waiting for Fidelity Digital Assets’ mandate to mature from just an institutional one to institutional and retail.”      Read more: ‘Focus on Retirement’: Crypto Custodian Rolls Out Hybrid IRA Offering      While Fidelity Digital Assets continues to be solely focused on institutional customers, this is one of the first sub-custody service agreements that the fund manager has made public.

42384105,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0Wht,1594731601,Shyft Debuts ‘Decentralized Version of SWIFT’ for FATF 'Travel Rule',"Shyft Network is rolling out its blockchain-based solution to help crypto companies comply with the identity and data sharing requirements mandated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).      Announced Tuesday, Shyft is releasing its Veriscope system to identify virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and VASPScan, a kind of block explorer for identifying VASP transactions.      The FATF’s Travel Rule requires firms dealing in virtual assets to share personally identifiable information (PII) and know-your-customer (KYC) data between a transacting originator and beneficiary, concurrent with the transfer itself, for transactions above $1,000.      Shyft, which was recently chosen by Binance as the preferred way of addressing the ""travel rule"" requirement has been working on this problem for close to three years, according to the platform’s co-founder, Joseph Weinberg, with some 30 VASPs having tested the tech over the past few months.      Read more: Binance Throws Weight Behind Shyft Network in ‘Travel Rule’ Standards Race      For many solution providers, the main problem being addressed is how to move data, noted Weinberg, whereas Shyft has focused on building a discovery layer.      “It’s really end to end, like a decentralized version of SWIFT,” said Weinberg. “We are basically taking the entire central clearing and transaction order base, and are using the blockchain as a way to allow all the counterparties to onboard, register and go through their own discovery creation process.”      As a first step, firms can join the Shyft network by identifying themselves with a public address, which creates a public registry of companies on the network. Then, to identify an unknown counterparty to a transaction, a known VASP creates an attestation, which means broadcasting a request for information regarding the undiscovered counterparty's public address.      “The exchange is raising its hand on the network and saying, ‘Hey, everybody, we are about to send a transaction to this address.’ They are asking, ‘Does anyone own this address, is this a VASP address?’” said Weiberg. “If no one has responded to this address, it’s assumed it is a non-custodial address” outside of the exchange ecosystem.    Centralized vs. decentralized    Shyft does monthly calls with the FATF to discuss approaches to solving the travel rule, and the regulator is impartial when it comes to decentralized versus centralized approaches to the problem, Weinberg told CoinDesk.      “I think there’s a lot of the ecosystem right now that is trying to make an attempt at centralization,” he said. “To be honest, I don’t think the FATF really cares, they just want to make sure they can measure for effectiveness.”      Read more: Inside the Standards Race for Implementing FATF’s Travel Rule      Shyft is also gearing up for “jurisdictional coalitions” of VASPs that may have particular data sharing requirements or privacy regulations. “I will say the first coalition we are working on right now is in Singapore, and a lot of the VASPs that we are starting off with are in Singapore,” said Weinberg.      A reliable counterparty discovery engine could also open the forbidden realm of decentralized finance (DeFi) to institutional players, Weinberg added.      “Institutional capital can’t play in DeFi, and the reason why is that they don't know who their counterparty is,” said Weinberg. “They are not allowed to participate in any liquidity pools, which means all this institutional money can’t go into a MakerDAO or something like that.”    Weinberg could not say exactly what big exchanges are following Binance’s lead, but a look at the Shyft website showshttps://www.shyft.network/team Peter Warrack, chief compliance officer at Bitfinex, and Craig Sellers, Tether co-founder and CTO, among the firm’s advisers.    “This will be driven by the providers of the most liquidity, which isn’t the U.S. VASPs,” said Weinberg. “The biggest ones in the world are firms like Binance, BitMEX, Bitfinex. I also think they are more like the champions of the ethos of crypto, which is about keeping things open and not allowing too much centralization, right?”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MINING | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/14/shyft-debuts-decentralized-version-of-swift-for-fatf-travel-rule,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6fff83dade115678517bee63fcca59ad74d2ef68-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Read an extract here.      Almost five years ago on July 30, 2015, part of the Ethereum team had gathered in Berlin to see the network they helped build go live. A big screen overhanging their worktables served as the countdown clock for when the test network reached block 1,028,201. That’s the palindrome and prime number they picked as the key which would launch the mainnet. Others were waiting for the launch in Ethereum hubs in Amsterdam, Toronto, New York and Zug, Switzerland.      It was the culmination of months of work, where core developers did the heavy lifting on the technical side, but which also included designers, marketers, and community managers. Ethereans knew a distributed network with no community would fail.    Ethereum turns five on July 30, 2020. CoinDesk is marking five years of Ethereum with a series of retrospective stories and live-streamed Twitter conversations. There are even some “Easter eggs” for eagle-eyed readers. Tune in to our CoinDesk Live sessions July 27-31 at 4 p.m. Eastern each day or call +1 (661) 4-UNICRN.    Early Ethereum team members had also spent endless hours with lawyers leading up to the ether sale, some co-founders had gone through bitter fights, while many others had ravaged their savings working with no salaries towards one goal: Making the vision Vitalik Buterin laid out on a white paper in November 2013, a reality.    It’s happening    When the test network hit the predetermined block at 4:26 p.m. in Berlin, a meme of Ron Paul, jubilant, with his arms up and surrounded in green laser beams and white block letters that read IT’S HAPPENING, popped up on the monitor. The Ethereum team opened a bottle of champagne while rocket emojis filled chat rooms.      The Ethereum network quickly left other blockchain upstarts behind and has since grown to become the second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, with ether’s market capitalization (as of writing) at just under $30 billion.    Minecraft of crypto-finance    But a better measure of success is to examine whether Ethereum builders achieved what they set out to do. Ethereum aims to be a “fully-fledged, Turing-complete (but heavily fee-regulated) cryptographic ledger,” which allows developers to build any application they can dream of on top, Vitalik wrote in the white paper, which inspired early team members to drop everything and join him in building it.      “Rather than being limited to a specific set of transaction types, users will be able to use Ethereum as a sort of ‘Minecraft of crypto-finance’ – that is to say, one will be able to implement any feature that one desires simply by coding it in the protocol's internal scripting language,” he wrote. Minecraft is a sandbox-style video game, which gives players flexibility to explore and build whatever they want in the game’s virtual world.      Vitalik, who was 19 years old at the time, listed on the Ethereum white paper the applications he envisioned could be built on top of this generalized platform:      Sub-currencies “representing assets such as USD or gold to company stocks and even currencies with only one unit issued to represent collectibles or smart property.”      Financial derivatives, such as “hedging contracts.” He notes that “financial contracts of any form do need to be fully collateralized; the Ethereum network controls no enforcement agency and cannot collect debt.”      Identity and reputation systems where “users can register their names in a public database alongside other data,” for example, for domain-name systems.      Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, which replicate traditional companies but use blockchain technology for enforcement. The entity would have shareholders who collect dividends and decide how the corporation automatically allocates its funds, “using either bounties, salaries or even more exotic mechanisms such as an internal currency to reward work.”      Also listed were crop and generic insurance, decentralized data feeds, gambling and prediction markets, a full-scale on-chain stock market and an on-chain decentralized marketplace.      Five years later, all of the use cases envisioned by Vitalik have become a reality, though some with more success than others.    Sub-currencies’ success    What Vitalik called sub-currencies – what we now know as tokens, stablecoins and NFTs – have arguably been the most successful applications on Ethereum so far. Valued at over $33 billion, Ethereum’s ERC-20 tokens represent almost 13 percent of total cryptocurrency market capitalization, according to Etherscan. Together with ether, all of the Ethereum ecosystem is about one-fourth of crypto.      The innovation of entrepreneurs being able to issue their own coins and sell them to anyone in the world in fundraising rounds, which for the first time didn’t need venture capitalists or banks, helped fuel one of the most spectacular speculative manias in 2017-2018. This past year, most growth has come from stablecoins, with tokens pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar trading at about $12 billion – that’s about three times stablecoin market cap a year ago, according to Messari data – most of which is on Ethereum, due mainly to Tether’s migration to the network.      Non-fungible tokens and their marketplaces had their biggest moment with CryptoKitties in late 2017, but the space is arguably one of the brightest spots for innovation within Ethereum, with use cases from in-game items to art and limited-edition fashion.    Dexs and derivatives    “On-chain stock exchanges” are today’s decentralized exchanges. While they still represent a fraction of total volume traded on centralized crypto exchanges, growth has been staggering. Almost $5.7 billion have traded so far on DEXs this year, or more than twice the value trading hands in all of 2019, according to Dune Analytics. Beyond volume metrics, DEXs are delivering on the cypherpunk dream of seamless, global, non-custodial trading of cryptocurrencies.      Financial derivatives are also flourishing. Synthetic assets platforms such as Synthetix and UMA allow almost any assets to be represented on the Ethereum blockchain, while margin trading platforms such as dYdX have enabled futures trading, the most popular asset in centralized crypto finance.      Meanwhile, lending platforms including Compound and Aave allow users to gain interest on their crypto deposits, and tokenize those deposits so they can be simply bought on an exchange and held in users’ wallets.      DAOs started out early in Ethereum history as one of the strongest projects. The DAO attracted, at the time, the most capital ever for an Ethereum fundraiser, though we all know how that ended. After a traumatic experience, the Ethereum community steered clear of decentralized organizations for a couple of years, until 2019 ushered a DAO revival. Initially, these entities were focused on distributing donations, but that quickly evolved into for-profit DAOs, like The LAO and VentureDAO.      Ethereum has also given rise to applications in prediction markets, identity systems and insurance, but they’re lagging financial applications in terms of volume and adoption.    Internet of value    Financial applications have had the greatest success on Ethereum so far, arguably because it provides something that just can’t be replicated by the current financial system, or by bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency. It’s a global network that’s built to transfer value, and it can also process computer programs to allow for more sophisticated financial transactions. Value held in these financial platforms has soared to more than $2 billion this year, a fivefold increase from a year ago.      Ethereum has successfully become the Minecraft of crypto finance, as Vitalik envisioned. But beyond becoming a platform that can support all these different kinds of applications, the biggest impact is it’s creating an actual internet of value. It’s a network that enables fast, cheap, global value transfers and the ability to program that money to become anything from futures contracts to collectibles to derivatives pegged to stocks, forex and commodities. And it’s allowing users of this system to take charge of their own assets and data.      Almost any network metric will show there is demand for permissionless, trustless systems. Active addresses are near a record at just under 568,000, a stone throw’s away from bitcoin’s 745,000, according to CoinMetrics. Transaction fees paid to the network’s miners have surpassed bitcoin’s, while daily transaction count is almost four times that of the biggest cryptocurrency at about 1 million, the data show.    A good problem to have    The question isn’t whether there’s demand for Ethereum, but whether the network will continue developing fast enough to meet that demand. The wait for ETH 2.0, which would allow Ethereum to scale, has been a constant in Ethereum’s history. A barebones proof-of-stake chain, which was slated to launch early this year, has been delayed and now it’s unclear whether it will launch this year at all.      But progress with Layer 2 solutions, which take transactions off-chain, has been encouraging. Teams working on Optimistic Roll-Ups are testing prototypes, while solutions using Plasma and Zero Knowledge technology are live right now and able to handle thousands of transactions per second. While the wait for ETH2.0 continues, the wait for Ethereum scaling is over.      The next five years will be about strengthening these scaling solutions and making these financial applications more robust and secure. It will also be necessary to create better crypto onramps and building apps in the less developed areas of Ethereum, like identity and insurance. The result will be this Minecraft of finance stops being an insiders’ secret and more players can join.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Camila Russo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/07/14/five-years-on-ethereum-really-is-the-minecraft-of-crypto-finance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/00b773babe1f9d1a45457c8e14bfabbfb5f11caa-2048x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As a result, the Bollinger bandwidth, a price volatility gauge, has declined to 0.04, the lowest level since Nov. 12, 2018, according to data source TradingView.      Bollinger bands are placed two standard deviations above and below the 20-day moving average (MA) of price. Meanwhile, the Bollinger bandwidth is calculated by dividing the spread between the volatility bands by the 20-day MA.      Volatility, as represented by Bollinger bandwidth, topped out at 0.89 following the March 12 crash, dubbed Black Thursday, and has been on a declining trend ever since.      A similar pattern was observed in 2018 (above right), when the bandwidth fell from 0.5 to 0.04 in the two months to Nov. 12. The cryptocurrency had been locked in the narrow range of $6,000–$6,800.      A prolonged period of low volatility consolidation often ends with a violent move in either direction. That’s what happened in 2018, two days after the bandwidth slipped to 0.04. The cryptocurrency dived below $6,000 on Nov. 14 – two days after the bandwidth hit a low of 0.04 – then went on to hit lows below $3,500 by Nov. 25. The fall marked a 41% drop over two weeks.      Back then, though, the broader market structure was bearish. The cryptocurrency had charted lower highs in the first half of the year, having topped out at $20,000 in December 2017.      The latest consolidation, on the other hand, was preceded by a bullish structure. The cryptocurrency bottomed out at $3,867 in mid-March and has charted multiple higher lows over the past four months.

For instance, over 62% of BTC haven’t moved in over a year, according to Glassnode, a blockchain analytics firm.      Meanwhile, the unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus launched by the global authorities to counter the coronavirus-induced economic slowdown is widely expected to boost demand for bitcoin, often touted as digital gold and a hedge against inflation. As such, the ongoing consolidation may end soon with a strong move to the higher side.      However, if the global stock markets begin to slide on renewed coronavirus concerns and China-U.S. tensions, bitcoin could instead witness a big move to the downside.

42384121,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0X21,1594728328,First Mover: Bitcoiners Not Worried Fed Money Printer Has Stopped Going 'Brrrr',"It would be an understatement to say bitcoin has been a big disappointment for traders and investors over the past few months.      Ever since the coronavirus ravaged financial markets in March and sent the Federal Reserve scrambling to pump trillions of dollars of emergency liquidity into global financial markets, cryptocurrency analysts have speculated a resulting surge in inflation would eventually push up bitcoin prices. The community even celebrated a meme, ""Money printer go Brrr,"" satirizing the U.S. central bank's efforts.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Yet, since late April, bitcoin prices have barely increased – hovering around $9,000, which is up from around $7,600 at the start of 2020, but still well off the year's high of $10,500 reached in February. At a time when the largest cryptocurrency was supposed to shine, it's been pushed out of the limelight by rallies in tech stocks and gold, not to mention price zooms in a cadre of lesser-known digital tokens including Chainlink's LINK , Cardano's ADA and Aave's LEND.      Bitcoin investors, though, are undaunted. They still see the cryptocurrency as a hedge against everything from inflation to turmoil in the global financial system to widespread bankruptcies, which by themselves could prompt new rounds of stimulus and money printing. The bet is the apocalyptic economic scenario remains entirely possible during the remainder of this already-tumultuous year.      ""Capitalism is either breaking or is already broken, and investors know it even if they are still playing the game,"" the cryptocurrency investment fund Arca wrote Monday in a weekly update. ""We believe Bitcoin will remain the best insurance policy against currency collapse and a complete unwind of the financial system as we know it.""      Last week, the Fed's balance sheet shrank by $88 billion, the most in 11 years, falling below $7 trillion as foreign central banks repaid emergency dollar loans known as ""liquidity swaps.""      Theoretically, such a decrease might be seen as bearish for bitcoin: The U.S. central bank's money printer was essentially working in reverse as market funding strains eased. That might imply lower inflation in the future.      ""This is part of the Fed’s success story in stabilizing markets,"" Bloomberg News trumpeted in an email. Cryptocurrency analysts were more focused on developments in the fast-growing arena of ""decentralized finance"" than they were about bitcoin.      Even Federal Reserve officials acknowledge that further stimulus might be needed with coronavirus cases rising across the southern and western U.S., threatening the prospect of a quick economic recovery.      Bank of America predicted in a report last week the Fed's balance sheet will climb by the end this year to about $7.6 trillion, which would be a new record.      But Marc Cabana, an interest-rates strategist for the bank, said in a phone interview the ""risks to our forecast are to the high side"" because it's not unlikely the U.S. central bank would pump in a fresh round of emergency liquidity if traditional financial markets took a turn for the worse.      ""The U.S. appears to have the virus under control in no way, shape or form,"" Cabana said. ""If market conditions deteriorate, they would respond. If it was another very acute and rapid deterioration in liquidity conditions, it can be quite fast.""      In the U.S., extra unemployment checks of $600 are set to expire at the end of July, and lawmakers are debating a fresh round of stimulus. According to Reuters, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi says the Trump administration's call to limit the next relief package to $1 trillion ""doesn't come anywhere near"" meeting the need.      ""Anything less than a further $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion would be a damp squib,"" Ian Shepherdson, of the economic forecasting firm Pantheon, wrote on Sunday.      Corporate bankruptcies are mounting, with the two-century-old clothier Brooks Brothers succumbing last week. Big banks such as JPMorgan Chase are preparing to report second-quarter results this week that analysts say will likely be marred by billions of dollars of loan-loss reserves.      The U.S. government's budget deficit totaled $864 billion in June, nearly as much as in the entire fiscal 2019, the Treasury Department said Monday.      Economists at Deutsche Bank who have predicted the U.S. deficit could total $4.5 trillion for all of fiscal 2020, say they expect the Federal Reserve's balance sheet to expand to $8.3 trillion by the end of this year.      ""It seems inconceivable to me that the Fed and other central bank balance sheets will do anything other than explode over the next decade and perhaps beyond,"" Jim Reid, strategist at the German bank, wrote Monday in emailed comments.      Mike Novogratz, CEO of the digital-currency firm Galaxy Digital, told Bloomberg Television last week the buoyant U.S. stock market is ""unhinged from reality "" and that he's been investing in gold and bitcoin.      Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency-data site Glassnode, in an email on Monday, highlighted an arcane analytical metric known as the ""stablecoin supply ratio"" that is supposedly bullish for bitcoin. There are signs bitcoin is becoming more broadly distributed among a larger group of investors. And a key measure of the Bitcoin blockchain's security rose Monday to a record level, a sign of ongoing investment by network operators.      Notoriously volatile bitcoin prices haven't moved by more than 1% for five straight days. Christine Sandler, head of sales and marketing for digital assets at the money-management giant Fidelity Investments, told First Mover last week that greater price stability could induce more big institutional investors to consider an allocation to bitcoin.      ""Perhaps this tamping of volatility will lead the thundering herd to crypto,"" Sandler said.      For bitcoin investors, even the doldrums can seem bullish.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,181 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,340 | 24-Hr Low: $9,155      Trend: Bitcoin's restricted trading environment continues, with its 30-day volatility falling to 23.5%, the lowest level since March 2019.      Some believe the cryptocurrency is on the brink of embarking on a new bull market cycle in the month(s) ahead as prices are holding above the 50-week moving average (MA).      Indeed, the bulls have maintained a strong foothold above the 50-week MA over the past eight weeks. In addition, signs of seller exhaustion near $9,000 have emerged on the weekly chart over the past two weeks. As such, a move higher cannot be ruled out.      Major resistance is seen near $9,930, which is the upper end of a pennant pattern defined by trendlines connecting the December 2017 and June 2019 highs and March 2017 and February 2019 lows.      A weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above that level would imply a bullish breakout from the 2.5-year-long pennant pattern and open the doors for a stronger rally toward $13,880 (June 2019 high). Analysts at cryptocurrency exchange Kraken think $10,500 is the level to beat for the bulls. That's a logical target because a move above $10,500 would invalidate a bearish lower high on the weekly chart created in February.      Meanwhile, on the lower side, $8,900 – the low of a doji candle created in the first week of July – is key support. If breached, the 50-week MA support at $8,598 would be exposed.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $9,180, representing a 0.36% decline on the day.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/14/first-mover-bitcoiners-not-worried-fed-money-printer-has-stopped-going-brrrr,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/941d016dbd0a11e586c55a3a58a8b4b12ff02ed3-1200x750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384110,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0WoB,1594728000,BitGo Looks to Rally Exchange Clients Around FATF Travel Rule Product,"BitGo has joined the pack of solution providers attempting to bring crypto in line with global anti-money laundering (AML) standards.      Announced Tuesday, the multi-tentacled crypto firm is offering API support for the latest guidelines from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The watchdog’s so-called “Travel Rule” stipulates the originators and beneficiaries of financial transactions over $1,000 be identified, and that their personal data must “travel” with those transactions.      BitGo’s offering seeks to remove the headache of identifying wallets and transferring personally identifiable information between clients that use the San Francisco-based firm’s technology or custodial services.      Back in 2018, FATF said virtual asset service providers (VASPs) would be brought within its ambit, which means creating something akin to the SWIFT interbank network but for pseudonymous cryptocurrency transactions.      Read more: Crypto ‘Gray’ Markets Could Be Unintended Consequence of FATF Travel Rule      BitGo is in a unique situation, said Chris Metcalfe, the wallet platform’s senior product manager, because it is both a VASP and provider of technology to numerous other VASPs. Being a regulated custodian, in the form of BitGo Trust, helped spark the API solution, he said.      “We had to have a Travel Rule solution for our own trust clients because we are a regulated U.S. entity that is a VASP,” said Metcalfe. “So we had to build this tech or figure out how to source it, and since we are a tech provider we built it ourselves and can now offer Travel-Rule-as-a-service to our exchange clients.”    ‘Source of gravity’    The FATF’s recent plenary was thought by many to signal a one-year progress review and the crypto industry has responded with a growing array of technical solutions, to the extent that some commentators have warned this is creating its own interoperability issue.      Read more: FATF Meets Wednesday to Discuss ‘Travel Rule’ for Digital Assets      In Metcalfe’s opinion, large players in the space will exert a gravitational pull on smaller VASPs, thus gradually creating a network effect.      “Folks who have some of the largest exchanges in their network, using their solution will create the gravity that pulls the smaller players towards those networks,” he said. “So, BitGo, being the wallet platform to many of these large exchanges, has a good reason to believe we are going to be a source of gravity.”      BitGo was unable to say which large exchanges might be adopting its API Travel Rule solution, but the company’s website lists big names including BitStamp, CME and Genesis Trading (like CoinDesk, owned by Digital Currency Group) among its 40-plus trading clients. BitGo’s multi-signature wallet tech handles some 20% of all bitcoin transactions.    FATF fam    BitGo is also involved in the bank-backed Travel Rule Protocol (TRP) group alongside the likes of ING Bank, Standard Chartered and Fidelity, as well as a U.S. Travel Rule working group that also includes Coinbase.      “We are working towards an MVP (minimum viable product) with the TRP, as well as the U.S. Travel Rule working group, so we kind of have our toes in two ponds, and intend to play in both of those networks,” Metcalfe said.      Read more: In Banking First, ING Develops FATF-Friendly Protocol for Tracking Crypto Transfers      A spectrum of Travel Rule solutions has emerged with decentralized blockchain-based solutions at one end and slightly more centralized approaches at the other. Metcalfe believes a decentralized blockchain-based network is “a great destination to arrive at,” but said it could be a heavy lift getting there quickly.      “For the groups we are talking to, getting to an MVP is very important,” Metcalfe said. “That’s not to say we are anti-decentralization. But some of the more centralized solutions allow you to get to MVP much faster; we don’t think decentralization is the first step.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/14/bitgo-looks-to-rally-exchange-clients-around-fatf-travel-rule-product,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7143ca183a3f68625a7f426ab128584a7f6cdb52-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Users in the European Economic Area (EEA) will be able to apply for a card from August while those in the U.K. will be able to do so afterwards.  Powered by Swipe, the card allows users to spend crypto – currently bitcoin, Binance coin, Swipe coin and Binance USD – at any merchant that supports Visa payments.  First released in beta back in April, the card only converts crypto into the local fiat currency at the point of sale.  The card was first tested in Vietnam and Malaysia.  Binance announced last week it acquired Swipe, which is based in the Philippines, for an undisclosed sum.  Many existing crypto cards are prepaid and require users to top-up before using; Binance card is connected directly to a user's wallet and works like a traditional debit card.  Josh Goodbody, Binance's director for European growth, said the Binance Card was a ""critical"" part of the company's expanded offering.

42384112,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0Wqh,1594720806,Canadian Government Paid Justin Trudeau Family Member to Talk at Blockchain Event,"Canadian politicians are seeking answers after the half-brother of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was paid by the federal government to speak at a blockchain conference last year.    According to a Monday report by The Globe and Mail, Kyle Kemper was paid C$12,430 (US$9,127) for speaking about blockchain technology at a conference in Zug, Switzerland, in June 2019.  Kemper had reportedly been asked by Canadian government officials to take on the speaker role after they'd heard him discussing the tech at a previous conference in Dubai.  Kemper said the choice was not made because of his family connection with Justin Trudeau.  The Prime Minister's Office said the role was given the seal of approval by Global Affairs Canada, the country's consular support and diplomatic relations department.  Opposition members of parliament (MPs) have said Trudeau's government should detail how the contract came to be gifted to Kemper.  A spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada, Krystyna Dodds, said the selection criteria for speakers are based on their recognition in the business community, their subject knowledge and their ability to speak in public.  Kemper was until last year the executive director of the Blockchain Association of Canada and is still an adviser to the group, according to his LinkedIn profile.  He's also written a book titled ""The Unified Wallet: Unlocking the Digital Golden Age,"" and has founded a wallet firm called Swiss Key.

Sweden's Riksbank, the world's oldest central bank, recently looked into the viability of CBDCs and arrived at mixed results for the purpose of central banking, citing the substantial change and cost involved in the shift to digital.  The Federal Reserve of Philidelphia also determined that CBDCs might one day replace the role of commercial banks, but with the added risk of potentially harming money markets.

42384120,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0WzV,1594713600,2020: The Year Ethereum Stayed Home,"This is a weird year for everyone and everything, but it's a particularly weird year for Ethereum.      Why? The second-largest blockchain by market cap and the largest by contributing developers has always been known for having lots of events. COVID-19 has put the kibosh on that.      ""These folks are in a state of constant BUIDLing"" Amanda Cassatt, a ConsenSys alum who launched its Ethereal event series, told CoinDesk in an email. ""Ethereum is also, by design, a uniquely collaborative community. These factors contribute to the prevalence of and enthusiasm for in-person events.""    Ethereum turns five on July 30, 2020. CoinDesk is marking five years of Ethereum with a series of retrospective stories and live-streamed Twitter conversations. There are even some “Easter eggs” for eagle-eyed readers. Tune in to our CoinDesk Live sessions July 27-31 at 4 p.m. Eastern each day or call +1 (661) 4-UNICRN.    In normal times, there's roughly one fairly big Ethereum conference somewhere in the world every month, but that has all come to a halt in 2020. The community's tentpole event, October's Devcon, announced its next gathering will be in 2021. Similarly, the Community Ethereum Development Conference, or EDCON, has taken 2020 off.      ""I guess normally the number of international events feels a little excessive, but EDCON and Devcon are mainstays and it does feel like a loss not to be able to have them,"" Jinglan Wang, leader of the Optimism scaling project, told CoinDesk.    Ethereum during coronavirus    This reticence to meet up makes sense due to safety concerns around COVID-19.      After all, one of the last big Ethereum events, EthCC, turned out to be the source of a COVID-19 cluster. Still, it makes for a very different time in the community, particularly if this dearth of gatherings drags on into next year.      Read more: Ethereum Community Grapples With Coronavirus as EthCC Cases Tick Upward      Lane Rettig, an Ethereum core contributor and former Ethereum Foundation employee (now at SpaceMesh), told CoinDesk this time at home has made him realize how much he wasn't getting done.      ""I think I had convinced myself I was operating at 60%-70% productivity. I was probably more at 20% productivity,"" Rettig said.      While he's enjoying this greater sense of accomplishment, Rettig also believes there's more to Ethereum's tendency to gather than just having the largest community of devs.      The enjoyment of being together is part of the stickiness of Ethereum's underlying technology.      ""I do think the in-person events are part of the DNA of the community and part of what binds us all together. And some of the affinity we share could hypothetically begin to dissipate,"" Rettig said of the current situation. ""If this was to go on some indefinite period, I would really be worried.""    Remote-first    But token investor William Mougayar was eager to downplay any risk. ""The Ethereum community has been used to working virtually anyway,"" Mougayar told CoinDesk.      Rettig, however, cited a comment from a friend to express what he's worried about if folks go too long without hanging out and having spontaneous encounters at events. ""The reason I'm here and the reason we're all here is because we want to work on cool shit with people we like and do it in a sustainable way,"" Rettig said, paraphrasing the comment from his Ethereum colleague.      It's that ""with people we like"" part that gets harder and harder to replicate virtually.      Read more: Ethereum Economics Gets Spotlight in Vitalik Buterin EDCON Keynote      No one knows quite when to look for the next big Ethereum gatherings to take place.      ""Given our community's interest in events, I could see larger in-person gatherings resuming in 2021,"" Cassatt predicted, but she also expects hybrid on- and off-line gatherings will be the norm from here on out. The virtual experience will vastly improve during COVID-19, she added, even for events that go back to an in-person focus.    What's missing    ""There's been a lot of snarky discussion around people saying we're glad in-person conferences aren't happening because now we are building more, which I think is a little shortsighted,"" ConsenSys developer relations staffer Coogan Brennan told CoinDesk.      Optimism's Wang agreed on the value of in-person events: ""They’re great opportunities to meet projects that you've been chatting online with, or random crypto people whose tweets you enjoy.""      Rettig shared a particularly concrete example of how events can be helpful for distributed teams. When he was working for the Ethereum Foundation's eWASM team (which is porting the popular WebAssembly framework, in part, over to Ethereum), he said they tended to gather a few times each year, anchored to some Ethereum event, be it Devcon, ETHDenver or some hackathon. They'd rent a whole-house Airbnb and live together and work side-by-side for a week. A physical hangout that was otherwise unheard of.      ""It would be very intense. Professionally as well as socially,"" Rettig said.      Jared Wasinger, still of the eWASM team at the Ethereum Foundation, confirmed that these side gatherings have been key.      ""I would say that the in-person events are definitely important from a morale point of view,"" he said.      Similarly, ConsenSys's Brennan said events served as a kind of punctuation in the year that Ethereum teams could organize their work around. A lot of product launches and debuts where driven by reveals at events. That was a way of driving excitement.      ""Ethereum conferences are very very known for dogfooding,"" the Ethereum Foundation's Hudson Jameson said. ""It inspires a lot of confidence in the community. People are using the things they are building and that brings people a lot of joy.""      Read more: The Next Big Ethereum Conference Will Run Almost Entirely on Blockchains      The online events themselves have been more beta tests than real products as of yet, though, as Cassatt noted.      ""I haven't seen any event completely crack the code on virtual networking, virtual sponsorships, or ticket sales,"" she said. ""Virtual events may be a tougher sell to sponsors, but I'm looking forward to seeing creative solutions emerge for virtual events to offer sponsors value in new ways.""    What's gained    ""Maybe there were too many events. This kind of break, if anything, it's positive. It's a benefit because there's been more productivity,"" Mougayar said.      ""Most events felt like a distraction to me, if I'm being honest,"" Spencer Noon, of DTC Capital, told CoinDesk. ""I'm actually pretty bullish on people in the community organizing some awesome virtual events, though.""      Noon may have been the only person CoinDesk spoke with that had real excitement about the potential of virtual gatherings. In fact, Rettig in particular noted how virtual events do a bad job of replicating the hallway (or lobby) conference, which is what people really go for. Still, many are looking forward to saving money on travel now and seeing more conference content delivered electronically.      For Jameson, there is an advantage in making the discussion around Ethereum more accessible.      ""It is a privilege to be able to travel the world,"" Jameson said. ""That intrinsically creates this different class system.""      Read more: Devcon Shows Ethereum’s ‘World Computer’ Is a Movement, Not a Product      Moving these things online has a leveling effect that brings more people into discussions in real time, which is when people want to participate in them.      Brennan took this a step further, saying that with online events ""you really have to engage people in a way about tangible technologies.""      He said his team has found a need to actually give people a way to work on their code rather than just wowing folks with a charismatic on-stage presentation. ""One of the things we have been trying to do with our ConsenSys Live series is to actually have code on screen,"" he said.      Mougayar also spoke about having done a long workshop with on-screen code and feeling that by doing it from home he could really focus in on it more.      The Ethereum Foundation's Jameson concurred. ""I think this creates a whole new paradigm of having to keep people's attention rather than waiting for the next big event to hear the next big announcement,"" he said.

42384115,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0WtD,1594705320,IRS Violated 'Taxpayer Bill of Rights' With 2019 Crypto Letters: Watchdog,"Cryptocurrency users in the U.S. remember July 26, 2019, as the day the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) came out swinging. It now turns out the agency may have been hitting below the belt.      That day, for the first time in its history, the IRS demanded thousands of virtual currency-holding taxpayers fess up to unreported crypto trading gains.      “We have information” on your cryptocurrency accounts, the agency warned these presumably tax-flouting taxpayers in a so-called “soft letter” that took an oddly hard line for being a compliance-promoting mass mailing. What this “information” was or how the IRS had gotten it was left unexplained by Letter 6173.      More clear was this: If these taxpayers did not refile their tax returns, address the apparent crypto discrepancies or, if they believed themselves already compliant, meticulously explain how and why in a sworn response, the letter warned they could be referred for “an examination” – an audit.      The letters did not spell out to these taxpayers that they were not yet under IRS examination. America’s Taxman wanted answers – and it wanted them in 30 days or less.    Crypto and Taxes 2020: Wednesday is this year's deadline for Americans to file their tax returns, and cryptocurrency users' obligations are as confusing as ever. This series of articles explores the complex issues facing digital asset investors.Read more:Even the IRS Admits Some Crypto Tax Regulations Are 'Not Ideal'Crypto Taxes: Still Confused After All These YearsHodlers Can Donate Crypto to Charity to Minimize Tax PaymentsView on Flipboard    Nearly a year later, the agency’s own Taxpayer Advocate Service is alleging that letter violated the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, adopted by the IRS under pressure from Congress.      The little-noticed controversy over Letter 6173 is part of an emerging struggle over codified rights supposedly guaranteed to every federal taxpayer in the United States. It also comes as the IRS mounts a distinct but intimately related campaign to enforce cryptocurrency tax compliance across all sectors of the cryptocurrency space.    A not-so-soft letter  In 2014, the IRS adopted 10 U.S. Constitution’s Bill of Rights-like safeguards in an attempt to educate and protect a U.S public skeptical they had any rights before the IRS, according to WeiserMazars LLPhttps://mazarsusa.com/ledger/irs-unveils-taxpayer-bill-of-rights/. The Taxpayer Bill of Rights is codified in the Internal Revenue Code.    According to Erin M. Collins, the National Taxpayer Advocate, an independent office within the IRS that combines the roles of an ombudsman and a public defender, Letter 6173 ran roughshod over those rights.      Read more: IRS Solicits Contractors to Help Examine Crypto Traders’ Tax Returns      “The Code, Congress and the IRS have repeatedly acknowledged taxpayers’ rights and protections, and this letter not only does not provide them — it undermines them,” Collins wrote in her ""2021 Objectives Report to Congress,"" released June 29. Collins heads the IRS’ nearly 2,000-strong team of independent advocates.      The virtual currency letter smashed through two tenets of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights – the right to privacy and the right to be informed – when it ordered taxpayers who were not under audit to submit examination-esque information to the IRS, she argued.    The Code, Congress and the IRS have repeatedly acknowledged taxpayers’ rights and protections, and this letter not only does not provide them — it undermines them.    Among Letter 6173’s demands: the taxpayer’s entire crypto trading history; a “statement of facts”; an explanation of how they got their crypto books clean; and copies of tax documents from 2013 through 2017, even though the statute of limitations caps the number of reviewable years at three. Recipients had 30 days to submit the sworn package “under penalty of perjury,” the letter said.      The IRS and the Taxpayer Advocate Service did not respond to individual requests for comment. But tax experts interviewed by CoinDesk generally agreed with Collins’ assessment of the letter.      “It does sound a little ominous,” said Mark Mazur, director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. “Normally, in my experience, soft letters are softer in that the deadlines are, you know, indefinite – in the future or something. But this one does seem a little tougher.”      Collins called that ominous toughness “disturbing” in her congressional report. Letter 6173 “appears to be a threat directed at taxpayers who believe they are compliant,” she said, and identified it as part of a larger pattern of the IRS using soft letters to “bypass” examinations and the procedural protections they afford.      She requested the IRS remove the examination-like demands from Letter 6173 and a second unrelated soft letter on the grounds they violated compliant taxpayers’ right to privacy and right to be informed. The IRS refused.    Nothing personal    Observers familiar with the space told CoinDesk the IRS’ soft letter was not likely a targeted attack on crypto users.      Letter 6173 was only the most aggressive variant in a trio of soft letter types the IRS sent to more than 10,000 suspected crypto holders in the summer of 2019, but the only variant that included explicit evidentiary demands (the IRS did did not provide a breakdown of how many of each type of letter were sent out).      In fact, Roger Brown, a former IRS lawyer who now heads regulatory affairs for crypto tax firm Lukka, speculated the agency was actually trying to educate crypto holders on compliance before matters got worse.      “The IRS thought, ‘I’m doing you a favor because instead of coming after you with a very serious accusation, a notice saying you owe me this money, I’m helping you along to comply,’” he said.      Read more: Crypto Holders Still Face Issues Reporting Tax Liabilities, Survey of CPAs Finds      Part of the reason such favors would be necessary at all is the tax system’s general incompatibility with cryptocurrency markets. It only began defining its treatment of the space in 2014.      Mazur, the tax policy expert, worked at the Treasury Department when it issued its 2014 cryptocurrency tax guidance, which he acknowledged had a rather limited scope.      The 2014 guidance “didn't do much more than say, ‘buying and selling virtual currency leads to gains or losses.’ It’s income. And then the analogy was like trading physical commodities,” he said.      But that analogy failed to account for the diversity of investment types, outcomes, potentialities and novelties that are rampant in crypto space but wholly absent from traditional markets, like hard forks and air drops. Five years passed before the IRS issued its second, more expansive guidance (two months after Letter 6173).      Add to that the simpler fact that crypto traders can quickly bungle documentation as they move their cryptocurrencies between exchanges and wallets, creating intricacies that even the most adept record keeper may be hard pressed to follow, said Brown. This, plus the emerging nature of the space, makes a soft-touch, soft-letter approach all the more important.      But the letter’s hard-line language towards compliant taxpayers becomes even more perplexing when read through that lens. The notice’s harshness blurred the line between soft inquiry and examinations, Brown said.    What’s next    Collins said in her report to Congress that the Taxpayer Advocate Service will “continue to work with the” IRS on eliminating these types of demands from soft letters, even though the agency has already refused such requests.      Taxpayers who received Letter 6173 and have not already settled could bring Collins' argument up as evidence in court, said Mazur.      “It could potentially lead to litigation from taxpayers who, if they're in a dispute with the IRS for not fulfilling the request from this letter, could say, ‘Oh no, this letter is a violation of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights.’”      Read more: IRS Crypto Summit Was About the Exchange of Ideas, Not Tax Guidance      Meantime, the letter’s “incredibly Orwellian” demand for sworn evidence may leave compliant taxpayers feeling trapped, said Jerry Brito, executive director of the crypto advocacy nonprofit Coin Center.      “You've filed a tax return [and] you've already signed under penalty of perjury that the information that you gave was accurate,” he said. “So this second, sort of out of nowhere, unrequired but sort of implied threat of ‘well if you don't file this, well, what are you signaling,’ it just puts the taxpayer in a Catch-22.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | FORKS,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/07/14/irs-violated-taxpayer-bill-of-rights-with-2019-crypto-letters-watchdog,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9be08f7e13c8fe39b399af23d89e75e937cd8d18-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42384108,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0WpR,1594705200,Crypto Taxes: Still Confused After All These Years,"Kirk Phillips is an entrepreneur, certified public accountant (CPA) and author of ""The Ultimate Bitcoin Business Guide: For Entrepreneurs & Business Advisors.""      You need to be nimble to be a crypto tax professional. As the industry has evolved over the last few years, there have been many technology changes, and many changes in how the IRS treats crypto taxation issues.      Between 2014, when the IRS issued its first virtual currency notice, and 2019, when it published new virtual currency FAQs, we saw all kinds of innovation requiring tax rethinks. Chain-splits, airdrops, token swaps, staking, DeFi yield farming, synthetic assets and more emerged in that period.      This explains why the AICPA (which represents accountants), the American Bar Association, and Coin Center have worked feverishly behind the scenes explaining to the IRS how “virtual currency events” should be taxed. As a member of the AICPA Virtual Currency Task Force, I’ve been fortunate to participate in these conversations and get a first hand view.    Crypto and Taxes 2020: Wednesday is this year's deadline for Americans to file their tax returns, and cryptocurrency users' obligations are as confusing as ever. This series of articles explores the complex issues facing digital asset investors.Read more:Even the IRS Admits Some Crypto Tax Regulations Are 'Not Ideal'IRS Violated 'Taxpayer Bill of Rights' With 2019 Crypto Letters: WatchdogHodlers Can Donate Crypto to Charity to Minimize Tax PaymentsView on Flipboard    Even today, it’s arguable whether we have greater clarity than before. Many tax professionals claim the recent guidance didn’t provide much clarity and created more confusion than it dispelled. For example, Rev. Rul. 2019-24 describes an “airdrop after a hard fork.” However these are independent and unrelated events, so professionals find it challenging to interpret the meaning and how to apply it.      This situation isn’t unique to crypto. Sometimes the IRS publishes final regulations more than a decade after taxpayers wish they were available. But it does make for unpredictable outcomes and forces individuals and businesses to file more in hope than expectation that they’ve acted correctly.      Even in a world where all taxpayers operate in good faith and make their best compliance efforts, they might take a completely different approach to the same scenario. For example, Taxpayer A arrives at a non-taxable or tax-deferred scenario while Taxpayer B concludes they have ordinary income, yet both were engaged in the same Virtual Currency Transaction X.      Tax positions are a game of risk management taking account the likelihood of audit, the strength of the position and amount of the tax liability, penalty and interest due if a taxpayer “loses the game.”      Risk management gets more complex when tax advisors are involved because their asses are on the line. There are more professional liability claims for tax services than any other service offered by CPAs. (Audit claims are higher in dollar value but lower in number.)      With this in mind, some tax preparers are undercharging for services and many taxpayers don’t understand how tax preparer risk is properly reflected in the price. Almost anyone can prepare taxes for hire and you don’t have to be a CPA. But like Robert Kiyosaki says, ""free advice is the most expensive advice,” referring to people who like to get advice from an “expert friend.”      Tax compliance and tax reporting are a collaborative dance between taxpayer and tax advisor. A taxpayer may prefer a more aggressive tax position, but both the taxpayer and tax advisor are simultaneously on the hook, albeit in different ways. Both parties have to come to and be comfortable with their consensus. Just add in crypto and the process becomes more challenging.      What we’ve seen since the IRS’s 2014 Notice makes it easy to conclude there'll be a larger cornucopia of “virtual currency events” over the next six years for the crypto tax industry to digest. Taxpayers will continue to take varied positions, some of which will be audited as the IRS steps up compliance efforts and finds a long-term approach.      The audits that end up in tax court will set “de facto tax guidance” for the whole industry to follow. The rulings are sure to be as entertaining but it’s a long road to reveal the answers taxpayers want today. Perhaps tax courts will chime in on whether chain-split coins are ordinary income when a taxpayer exercises dominion and control, capital gains only when sold or something else.      In the meantime, the AICPA, Lukka Library and individual CPA and law firms are producing excellent resources to help navigate uncertain crypto seas. The result is a ""collective knowledge base” allowing everyone to benefit. Tax clarity is ever-evolving, so get educated.      Enjoy your ride on the crypto tax rollercoaster.

But they can write it off by donating to a worthy cause of their choice, according to one crypto-focused charity.      The Giving Block, a platform that enables nonprofit organizations to accept donations in cryptocurrency and has helped raise over $1 million to support pandemic relief efforts through its #cryptoCOVID19 campaign this year, is hoping to make it easier for taxpayers to file their returns by publishing a guide on how to donate their holdings and maybe minimize some taxes.      The group collaborated with crypto tax software TAXbit to create the guide, said co-founder Alex Wilson.      “In our opinion, most crypto users still don’t know that they can donate crypto and save money on their taxes,” Wilson said.    Crypto and Taxes 2020: Wednesday is this year's deadline for Americans to file their tax returns, and cryptocurrency users' obligations are as confusing as ever. This series of articles explores the complex issues facing digital asset investors.Read more:IRS Violated ‘Taxpayer Bill of Rights’ With 2019 Crypto Letters: WatchdogCrypto Taxes: Still Confused After All These YearsEven the IRS Admits Some Crypto Tax Regulations Are 'Not Ideal'View on Flipboard    According to the tax guide, which was first published last week, if a taxpayer donates cryptocurrency to a 501(c)(3) qualified nonprofit organization, it is a “non-taxable event for givers and receivers.” This means the donation will not be recognized as income or as a gain or loss. Donors do not have to pay capital gains tax on appreciated cryptocurrency, and will qualify for itemized charitable deductions depending on how long they held the crypto asset before the donation was made.      “If you held the cryptocurrency for more than a year (‘long-term’) prior to the donation then you will be eligible for the itemized charitable deduction for the fair market value (FMV) of the cryptocurrency at the time of contribution, in addition to not incurring a taxable gain on an appreciated asset,” said the guide.      This claim is backed up by the IRS's non-binding Frequently Asked Questions.      Wilson said that 29 nonprofit organizations signed up to receive funds through the COVID-19 campaign, while 50 different corporate partners came together to help raise funds and awareness. Bitcoin (BTC) was the most donated cryptocurrency followed by ether (ETH).      “Now we are looking to replicate that success with the #CryptoForBlackLives campaign,” Wilson said.      Launched last month, the initiative hopes to raise $1 million for the civil rights campaign, with about $50,000 raised so far.      The Giving Block was founded two years ago by Wilson and Pat Duffy, when they realized crypto users had a tax incentive to donate their virtual currency directly to nonprofits. Wilson said the platform currently supports over 50 nonprofit organizations.      Crypto tax attorney Justin Woodward, the guide’s author, said in a statement to the press that it was “far more tax advantageous to donate capital assets rather than traditional fiat.”      “We believe it to be the future of charitable giving,"" Woodward said.

I’ve been covering taxes around the crypto space for most of the past year and have talked to more than half a dozen certified public accountants, tax lawyers and other professionals about what the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) issued crypto tax guidances are actually telling us. If a reporter who’s been embedded in the space is having this much trouble, imagine how hard it might be for a complete newcomer.      This is going to remain one of the biggest barriers to mainstream adoption.    Crypto and Taxes 2020: Wednesday is this year's deadline for Americans to file their tax returns, and cryptocurrency users' obligations are as confusing as ever. This series of articles explores the complex issues facing digital asset investors.Read more:IRS Violated 'Taxpayer Bill of Rights' With 2019 Crypto Letters: WatchdogCrypto Taxes: Still Confused After All These YearsHodlers Can Donate Crypto to Charity to Minimize Tax PaymentsView on Flipboard    Even the IRS admits the guidance leaves questions unanswered. An IRS official said taxpayers should take advantage of both the forms that exchanges are issuing to list taxable events and the different software tools that have been built to help simplify the process.      The official, who did not have authorization to speak publicly, acknowledged that some of the guidance published to date could be clarified and “is not ideal,” saying the agency is working to keep up with the crypto industry.      One of the major outstanding questions falls around information reporting, said Michael Meisler, a partner at Ernst and Young (EY) who specializes in taxes and is the Big Four auditor’s global blockchain tax leader.      Taxpayers can use different methods to report how much they believe they owe, but they should be consistent when calculating gains and losses. Using weighted averages, for example, might be impermissible under existing guidance and the FAQs (which Meisler noted is not “published guidance” in the legal sense).      The IRS official agreed, telling CoinDesk this is the next issue on its list around crypto.      “The IRS is working on guidance about how to get proper information reporting and what is the proper form of information reporting, and the IRS has recognized that that guidance is lacking as far as what the exchanges should report on,” the official said. “We're working on that as part of our guidance plan and that is really probably the top most guidance priority for the IRS, in, in the realm of virtual currency at this time.”    Other questions    Another unanswered question around crypto taxes revolves around staking, said Shehan Chandrasekara of CoinTracker, a crypto tax service. He pointed to Ethereum’s pending upgrade to Eth 2.0, which will see the second-largest cryptocurrency’s consensus mechanism switch from proof-of-work (where computers maintain the network by running complex calculations and issuing blocks with crypto in them as a reward for miners) to proof-of-stake (where computers maintain the network by locking in large amount of wealth from validators that earn annualized interest as new blocks are issued).      “There’s a lot of people making passive income through staking,” he said.      It gets weirder with decentralized finance (DeFi). While centralized exchanges are publishing 1099 forms and sending both the IRS and taxpayers information about their transactions, decentralized platforms might not be.      “DeFi platforms aren’t issuing tax forms,” Lodha said.      Margin trading is another issue where unsophisticated users are ending up with leveraged positions, since crypto derivatives settled in crypto essentially mean the taxpayer is receiving property at the end of the transaction.      “There's pretty clear guidance on non-crypto futures, like if you're trading regulated commodity futures that are [U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission] regulated, there's like a ton of legislation around how that works,” he said.      Crypto futures fall into a fuzzier category, particularly as unsophisticated traders (like some Robinhood users) might end up with highly leveraged positions without understanding the tax implications, he said.      Read more: IRS Crypto Summit Was About the Exchange of Ideas, Not Tax Guidance      The way IRS guidance on airdrops and hard forks is currently worded may be unclear, the official added.      At present, the biggest issue the IRS has is a resource one, given how quickly the industry changes and the other issues facing the agency today, including the response to COVID-19.      “[The] industry changes so quickly that to try and keep up with the industry and make the guidance relevant [is challenging]. At the same time the IRS has been facing other legislations with regard to the Taxpayer First Act and then some of the legislation with respect to COVID,” the official said. “The biggest challenge is just kind of resource, and facing the other legislative priorities that have been coming out.”      Still, the IRS has published multiple pieces of guidance and its FAQs, which shed some light on what taxpayers might owe and how they should calculate those costs.    Filing your taxes    What the IRS has made clear is taxpayers need to file if they made (or lost) any money as a result of exchanging their crypto for fiat or another cryptocurrency; if they gained any crypto as a result of airdrops or hard forks; or if they gained funds as a result of staking or mining.      The IRS added a mandatory question to the U.S. tax return last year, asking if the individual held or transacted with crypto during the year.      “That question proves intent, so if you lie to that and then the IRS finds out through [a] 1099 that exchanges issue or through scanning the blockchain … then all of a sudden it can turn criminal,” said Austin Woodward at crypto tax startup TaxBit. “It is important to take that question seriously and answer it honestly.”      The IRS is cracking down on crypto taxes this year in a way the agency hasn’t in past years, said Chandan Lodha of CoinTracker.      He pointed to the 1040 form, last year’s updated guidance and the 10,000 warning letters the IRS sent to taxpayers last year. IRS job postings also seem to indicate the agency is “doubling down on hiring consultants” to track transactions and de-anonymize transactions.      Read more: IRS Solicits Contractors to Help Examine Crypto Traders’ Tax Returns      If taxpayers don't have the necessary information to fully file their taxes, they should file for an extension, said CoinTracker’s Chandrasekara. Lodha added that doing so is “super trivial,” with no downside.      Chandrasekara noted the extension only allows taxpayers to file their forms later, but any payments they owe are still due on July 15.      Just by filing an extension, taxpayers might avoid having to pay a penalty for being late on their paperwork, he said. Still, they might owe some penalties for paying late (which is better than not filing at all and potentially being audited).      “My recommendation is if somebody doesn’t have all the information to figure out their tax liability, just be more conservative,” he said. If a filer says they made more on crypto than they actually did, they’ll get whatever excess they paid back.    Remaining compliant    The IRS takes enforcement more seriously than comparable agencies in most other countries, Woodward said, similar to the Australian Tax Office.      The agency mailed some 10,000 letters to taxpayers in 2019, asking them to verify their crypto transactions and offering hints at how to calculate their fair holdings’ fair market value. A second set of letters warned taxpayers they may have incorrectly reported their holdings, and detailing what the agency believed to be the correct amount owed.      “I think right now [the IRS’ taxation treatment] falls in line pretty closely with that of equities so it's nothing new. It's been around for you know decades now,” Woodward said. “It's just cumbersome in the crypto space as opposed to the equity space because there's so much more transaction volume.”      The IRS is definitely taking the space seriously though, he said, a sentiment Lodha echoed.      There’s “significant evidence” the IRS cares, including through its recent postings seeking expertise around crypto transactions, Lodha said.      The IRS official CoinDesk spoke to recommended using the different software tools that have been released.      “Taxpayers should at least use the information that their exchanges provide and reflect that on their returns, and there are tools out there that they can use that interact with these exchanges that [conduct] the process now kind of seamless in the realm of someone who's engaging in cryptocurrency transactions,” they said.      Read more: The IRS Just Issued Its First Cryptocurrency Tax Guidance in 5 Years      It’s important to be careful when using different software products as well, Meisler warned. Different software solutions running the same data might calculate different gains/losses due to how they interpret guidance. This could happen if one solution calculates fees different from another, for example.      The taxpayer would still be responsible for accurately reporting their holdings to the agency, he said.      “If the guidance is lacking, the taxpayer should use their best efforts and then take consistent positions from their reporting,” the IRS official said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | FORKS,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/07/14/even-the-irs-admits-some-crypto-tax-regulations-are-not-ideal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/98613f66e0d30ab3ff79154ddb0274b1dda91e7d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
