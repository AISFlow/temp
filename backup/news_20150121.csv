42377946,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LY9h,1421880934,Mastercoin Seeks Second Start With Omni Reboot,"Mastercoin's leadership team admits it has been fighting an uphill battle.  The project, one of the first in the crypto 2.0 space – perhaps by virtue of its early status and public controversies – continues to be dogged by outspoken critics who seek to decry the project as dead. The decline has been sharpened by the spike in interest surrounding competitor Counterparty, which after launching in 2014 forged a partnership with Overstock and has seen new entrepreneurs use its platform to release assets on the bitcoin blockchain.  In 2015, however, Mastercoin is seeking to turn the page as Omni, rebranding in a new bid to change this narrative. As a result of the move, many of the remaining Mastercoin leadership, including chief architect JR Willet, CTO Craig Sellars and board member and BitAngels co-founder David Johnston, will migrate to Omni to solidify their message and clear up marketplace confusion that they feel has held back their efforts.  Speaking to CoinDesk, the Omni team sought to reframe its offering as the only crypto 2.0 protocol that provides a tested platform that can support ambitious projects like decentralised recordkeeping network Factom, decentralised Internet provider MaidSafe and currency-backed token project Tether – all of which use the rebranded Omni layer.  Despite public perception, the Omni team remains confident that it has identified its core weakness, messaging, which it believes has failed to properly tout the core technological competencies of the project to the wider community.  Johnston told CoinDesk:  “It’s funny we’ve done these huge projects, but haven’t trumpeted them to the community. I think having the projects more involved in that structure – they have a way to trumpet themselves.”  Johnston is speaking of how Omni will seek to promote its efforts, by relying on the community of projects that uses its protocol to speak to its attributes. He also touched on misconceptions that have been partly proliferated by the project’s past decisions.  One of the first projects to hold a crowdsale, Omni argues that, because of such misconceptions, the Mastercoin Foundation was often looked to as a company that should be responsible for building on top of, instead of evangelizing for its platform.  “No one would look at the Bitcoin Foundation and say, ‘Why haven't you built Coinbase yet?’” Johnston continued. “That’s totally outside of the competency, but people had that misconception that the Foundation was going to do everything.”  Mastercoin Foundation continues  Going forward, the Omni project wants to make sure its efforts are more distributed.  Two of Mastercoin’s projects – its decentralised exchange and Omniwallet, for example – will be operated by the Omni Foundation. Conversely, the Mastercoin Foundation will continue to be responsible solely for distributing mastercoin tokens to developers.  “We’ve left one role for the old foundation, which is to hand out the developer tokens and that board will be elected by the people that own tokens in the system,” Johnston said. “The proof of stake – that’s what it does – it’s responsible for handing out developer tokens, and they’re giving out half the first year, one quarter the second year and so on.”  “All [the original Mastercoin crowdsale participants] still own their same tokens,” he continued. “Nothing changes with that.”  By contrast, the Omni team framed its efforts as largely geared toward inspiring developers to innovate and build on the platform. Johnston portrayed Omni as a project that would empower those building on it to take the lead in its efforts.  “It’s a community-driven effort meaning that MaidSafe, Tether and Factom – and all the people that are using that protocol are members of the foundation – they’re sponsoring the developers to work on the decentralised exchange and improve the code,” he said.  Focus on messaging  Throughout the conversation, the Omni team strived to emphasize that while Counterparty may have succeeded at bringing in new developers, its platform is the one that supports those with the largest market capitalizations.  Michael Terpin, CEO of PR firm Social Radius, which is now working with Omni, cited the fact that MaidSafeCoin, an asset on the omni protocol, has a $13m market cap at press time – which is greater than that of both Counterparty’s tokens and Mastercoin, now Omni’s, tokens combined.  “Counterparty has put some focus on promoting what they’ve been doing,” said Terpin. “Mastercoin was focused internally, and there was some backlash to that. I think going forward, we’re going to be more proactive in communicating to the marketplace what we’re doing.”  As to how exactly Omni would inspire its developers to be more vocal about the Omni protocol, Sellars was less clear, though he said efforts are on the way to highlight the technological capabilities of the platform.  “Amazon doesn’t come out and say, ‘Hey we’re using HTTP, because it’s the foundational layer. It’s ‘Well, of course they are’. So, what we’d like to see is broader and wider adoption such as we become a foundational layer, and that communication is the responsibility of the innovators and not anyone at Omni,” Sellars said.  Open elections  Johnston indicated that the Omni Foundation will seek to hold elections open to all its members to create a new board.  “It’s a totally clean break, it will all be elected by the community,” Johnston said.  Johnston further explained that the former Mastercoin community has been a part of what it's long described as its “great transition” to Omni, first discussed in October. Since then, Omni said it has been open with its community in blog posts and on Reddit about the transition, and that while far from the headlines, it was soliciting feedback on its work.  “It’s about a six-month discussion and it was a vote by the foundation to do this,” Terpin said. “The old board elected to make this transition.”  The case for the technology  The Omni team also continued to stress the benefits of its partnerships, citing one recently completed agreement between Comstock Mining and HOPE Gold Coin Charitable Trust. The 150-year-old gold and silver mining company licensed five tons of gold and gold-equivalent to allow the project to back the value of HOPE Gold Coins, a new cryptocurrency on the Omni protocol.  Sellars also emphasized that all of the tools available on Bitcoin Core are now available to Omni developers, and spoke to the positive feedback Omni has received on the ease of use of its technology.  But while just one in an increasingly divided crypto 2.0 space, Sellars ended on an inclusive message to the community, citing his excitement about all applications, from Counterparty to colored coins.  “I see Omni as being an all-inclusive platform, if there was a way for all these projects to leverage the work we’ve put in over the last 18 months, I would be ecstatic,” he said, adding:  “In essence we’ve released software and that software can be expanded and we’re hoping the community steps up and uses us as a base to expand their own platforms.”  Image via Omni  For further information on cryptocurrency 2.0 projects download our research report.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/21/mastercoin-seeks-second-start-with-omni-reboot,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d605d401d46750bd4918f74e6c89c084aafb1023-1239x543.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Acting US attorney Annette Hayes announced that Brian Richard Farrell, 26, was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of being a ""key administrator"" of Silk Road 2.0 under the pseudonym ""Doctor Clu"".  Farrell's arrest comes two months after Blake Benthall, the alleged leader of Silk Road 2.0 was arrested by federal authorities on counts of conspiring to commit drug trafficking, computer hacking, dealing in fraudulent documents and a count of money laundering conspiracy.  Farrell, who drew the attention of Homeland Security Investigations agents last July has been charged with conspiracy to distribute heroin, methamphetamine and cocaine.  When the search warrant was served at Farrell's residence in Seattle, agents seized $35,000 in cash as well as varied drug paraphernalia.  According to the criminal complaint, Farrell was allegedly involved ""in activities such as approving new staff and vendors for the website, and organising a denial of service attack on a competitor"".  In the statement, announced on the FBI website, Hayes said:  ""The arrest of Mr. Farrell is proof that federal law enforcement continues its efforts to root out those who subvert the Internet to set up black markets for illegal goods.""  Paving the way    The original Silk Road website was launched in February 2011 and was closed by the FBI in 2013. Its alleged founder, Ross Ulbricht, is currently undergoing trial in New York’s federal court.      The remaining administrators of the service launched its second version, Silk Road 2.0, in November 2013 and it wasn't long before they started to attract users.    According to the bureau, Silk Road 2.0 generated estimated sales of $8m per month and had approximately 150,000 active users by September 2014.  In May the Digital Citizens Alliance published a study that looked into the emergence of deep web black markets following Silk Road's demise. It explains that other marketplaces profited after Silk Road shut down, with Black Market Reloaded (BMR) and Sheep Market as key players.  Shortly afterwards, a similar site, Atlantis, closed in what many considered a scam that left it holding customers' bitcoins. It was around the same time that Silk Road 2.0 sprung into action.  Like its predecessor, it is notorious for being one of the most sophisticated and widely used online marketplaces for illicit products. The site, which operated on the Tor network, was designed to conceal the IP addresses of computers that used it.",NEGATIVE,없음,MARKET | REGULATION,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/21/alleged-silk-road-20-accomplice-arrested-on-conspiracy-charges,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7711e2108c2f2856bf6f6bdde33acac4e7be1f25-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377957,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LYMH,1421860837,PayPal Speaker Series Examines Good and Bad of Bitcoin,"Online payments leader PayPal held an introduction to bitcoin event as part of its monthly TechXploration speaker series yesterday, packing hundreds into its Town Hall auditorium in San Jose, California.  Attendees gathered for a deep, yet entertaining, session on how bitcoin works, overseen by the digital payments innovator that took the industry by storm in its early days with email-based money transfers.  Leading the talk was Lorne Lantz, a developer and technical contributor for Andreas Antonopoulos' book ‘Mastering Bitcoin’.  While known principally as a payments solution, however, Lantz told the audience that is a small part of what bitcoin's greater technology and potential.  He said:  “Money is just the first app for bitcoin. Just like email was the first app for the Internet.”  The PayPal TechXploration event was held in part to promote the O’Reilly Bitcoin and Blockchain conference being held 27th January in San Francisco. Lantz is an organizer for the one-day affair, which will feature speakers such as Reid Hoffman of Greylock Partners, Balaji Srinivasan of Andreessen Horowitz and Andreas Antonopoulos.  Positives and negatives  The presentation began with Lantz playing a video of various media clips often falsely portraying bitcoin, including one of famed investor Warren Buffet saying bitcoin is ""a mirage, basically"".  How bitcoin transactions are confirmed and how cryptography plays a part were important aspects discussed during the session.  The presentation also dived deep into bitcoin’s open-sourced ledger.  Lantz said:  “The power behind bitcoin is the blockchain.”  He did not gloss over the fact that bitcoin has its drawbacks, though he did promote bitcoin as a great merchant tool that has lower fees and cash-like properties.  Lantz went on to note that although bitcoin could be a great tool for the unbanked, there are fewer consumer protections.  PayPal and bitcoin  As a company always keeping close watch the on digital payments industry, PayPal has already integrated online bitcoin payments via its Payments Hub.  That PayPal offers educational content on bitcoin could perhaps be indicative of the digital currency's liftoff. That Lantz said he sees bitcoin innovating online payments – PayPal’s core business – is a promising indicator for enthusiasts of bitcoin and its wider adoption.  “Online is actually taking off. It’s got some nice traction,” he said.  However, Lantz added:  “There’s a series of things that add up making it difficult for merchants to accept bitcoin offline.”  One of the big problems Lantz pointed out was the often difficult integration of bitcoin into the existing point-of-sale systems used by bricks-and-mortar businesses.

42377952,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LYFz,1421845208,Bitspark Rolls Out Remittance Service to Indonesia,"Bitspark is targeting Hong Kong's sizeable population of Indonesian migrant workers with a new bitcoin-enabled remittance corridor.  The announcement comes just a month after launching an identical service servicing the Philippines.  The firm is pitching its low-cost way of sending money back home to more than 165,000 Indonesians residing in Hong Kong – 90% of whom are employed as foreign domestic helpers, according to the Census and Statistics Department.  For the new service, Bitspark is sticking to the model it developed for Philippine remittances last month.  This means a customer walks up to the firm's counter at World-Wide House, a popular migrant worker hangout, to hand over their Hong Kong dollars. Bitspark coordinates with its Indonesian partner, Artabit, which enables the recipient to collect Indonesian rupiah from a bank or post office within 24 hours.  The process allows customers to deposit and withdraw cash, without touching bitcoin, while Bitspark and Artabit transact in the cryptocurrency. In the Philippines, Bitspark works with bitcoin exchange Rebit.  Bitspark co-founder George Harrap said:  ""We can now do same-day transfers in Indonesian rupiah to the other end.""  Diversifying the customer pool  The firm has moved to charging a flat fee for remittances instead of the 1% cut it levied for transfers to the Philippines last month. Customers sending funds to Indonesia pay HK$25 (US$3.22), while those making transfers to the Philippines pay HK$15 (US$1.93).  Even as the firm expands its remittance reach, it's also diversifying its pool of customers.  Harrap says that his firm is now transferring more money for companies instead of individuals. Employment agencies for foreign labour in Hong Kong, for example, remit funds to their home countries regularly to meet overhead expenses there.  ""Employment agencies will often have an office in the Philippines where they source many of the candidates. They have bills to pay in the Philippines,"" Harrap said.  Bitspark is currently completing 10 to 20 transfers a day, according to Harrap, and volume has been doubling every week. Business customers are driving the higher volume, Harrap says, because they typically remit funds fortnightly compared to monthly remittances by individuals.  Traditional fiat currency remittances to Indonesia from Singapore cost 5% of the transferred amount on average, rising to as high as 10% of funds, according to the World Bank. The World Bank doesn't track the cost of funds sent from Hong Kong, but the Singapore-Indonesia corridor is comparable.  Unscathed by bitcoin price crash  Bitcoin's crashing price hasn't triggered any losses for Bitspark, Harrap said, although he declined to state his firm's methods for insulating its funds from bitcoin's price volatility.  He said only that he didn't necessarily exchange remitted funds for bitcoin immediately, and that he had figured out a ""better"" method.  Harrap is among those who are trying to exploit bitcoin's potential as a means for cross-border transfers rather than its properties as a speculative financial asset.  He said:  ""For our remittance service we don't care if the price is $1 or $1m. Bitcoin is the means of transmission. We're getting the message across that bitcoin has real-world applications besides speculation.""

42377953,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LYIV,1421833887,How One Startup Will Use Blockchain Tech to Disrupt Online Gaming,"Play, a Chinese/international startup team that plans to disrupt the incumbent online game industry using blockchain tech to remove trust, has recently 'gone public' as a decentralized autonomous company (DAC) on crowdfunding platform DACx.com.  In its prospectus, Play claims it offers a third-party verifiable mechanism to ensure true randomness and fairness for gamers by placing the games' logic on a blockchain. This would remove the need for trust in centralized institutions, it says.  The startup will also offer a platform to aggregate all games using its proprietary technology, and an in-game assets-trading platform to make tokens, props acquired from different games and Play’s crypto-shares exchangeable.  The DACx platform is operated by ZAFED, a Shanghai-based financial service provider established in September last year, which itself has raised seven-figure dollar investment via Lightspeed Partners in China.  Distributed company model  The ambitious-sounding project will not take the form of a company, in the formal sense, meaning it will not be subject to regular company laws, but will instead be governed purely through the alignment of incentives.  Play's own description of itself as a DAC reflects its aim to disrupt the existing company model.  The project seeks to raise anywhere up to 3,000 BTC by selling 20% of its total two billion total shares to global investors who, regardless of the jurisdictions they operate in, can invest in this project by sending bitcoins to the designated address.  As of 15th January, 2015, Play's website indicates it has raised 1,777 BTC.  According to DACx, the shares investors buy will be tradable through BitShares' Play P2P exchange.  Trusting smaller developers  Speaking to CoinDesk, ZAFED president James Gong explained Play's key value propositions.  One problem that hinders the success of small-chance game developers (games such as dice and online poker), he said, is the ""trust issue"".  While larger developers have stronger incentives to ensure fairness when their reputation is at stake, for smaller game developers such incentive can be easily overwhelmed by the prospect of short-term gain. Users, aware of the risk, tend to shun the latter as a result.  The proposed solution is what Gong calls 'on-chain games'. These are ""games that run their entire logic on the blockchain and that are independent from any external centralized intuitions"", he said, and will lead to reduction of trust-related risks.  The project’s white paper, which can be downloaded on its website here, elaborates more on the topic:  ""Chance games have come to rely almost exclusively on trusted third parties to provide random feeds. While this system works well enough, it is based on a centralized trust model, and suffers from the possibility of cheating by players. Even thought some crypto based games on the Internet have probably random feeds, which can be verified by the public, hidden players can cheat by submitting selective favorable transactions because they know the random secret in advance.""  Real-life predictions  Play has also described new types of games that will utilize the technology that it develops, although the company claims the games will be developed by third-party developers.  ""The goal of Play is to afford the players with access to a rich variety of games on the Play platform, all to be provided by third-party developers. The platform will not only offer probability games, but also include more advanced games like betting on real events, chess games and board games.""  It goes on to describe some games. One is a real-event betting game, otherwise known as a 'prediction market'.  Participants will bet on whether an event will happen, or how something will happen, in the future. For example, if a particular celebrity will get married or divorced in a specific amount of time.  Play explains:  ""This data needs to be inserted into the blockchain, a job that can be done by 'delegates'. Because delegates are elected by shareholders, we assume the results of vote are reliable. If not, the consequence is shared by Play shareholders who elected the delegates, which means that it will fall on the whole community, in which case, it is still fair.""  Building an economic system  Aside from the enhanced fairness and innovation in the games, Play also proposes to build an exchange platform to form a wider economic system surrounding them.  According to its white paper, ""Play allows users to issue customized assets, which will be tradable on the platform of Play and can be sold for the crypto shares that Play issued.""  Gamers will be able to buy and sell their game tokens and props on the exchange, which results in what the paper calls an ""inter-server and inter-game P2P economic system"".

According to a Bloomberg report, Faiella said:  ""At the time of the event, I saw no other way ... it still doesn’t mitigate that I broke the law.""  Faiella, a 53 year-old Florida native, is a former plumber who claimed he had turned to the bitcoin exchange business to support his family after becoming disabled with back problems. He and Shrem were arrested in January 2014.  Sentenced by US District Judge Jed Rakoff, who also presided over Shrem's case, Faiella faced a five-year maximum term.  Related cases  Shrem himself was sentenced in December to two years in prison after making a plea deal with prosecutors. While currently living at home, he must surrender himself at a date yet to be determined and any travel prior to that needs to be approved by a judge.  He was not able to obtain permission to attend the recent North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami.  Shrem also admitted his actions had broken the law, and said his sentence was light considering the 30-year maximum he had faced, and up to 60 months even with the plea bargain.  He also had to forfeit $950,000 in profits and will have three years of supervised release after his sentence is complete.  Ross Ulbricht, accused of being the ringleader of the Silk Road operation called 'Dread Pirate Roberts', is currently on trial for drug trafficking, money laundering and computer hacking in New York.  Ulbricht has not made a plea deal and faces life in prison if found guilty.

42377963,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LYRJ,1421801421,BBVA: We Wanted to Better Understand the Bitcoin Opportunity,"While there were many big-name participants in Coinbase’s most recent $75m funding round, perhaps no name caught more attention than BBVA Ventures, the private equity subsidiary of Spanish multinational bank Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA).  BBVA  ’s direct investment in the round is especially notable given the continued difficulties companies in the bitcoin and wider digital currencies space face obtaining even operational bank accounts.  However, according to BBVA Ventures executive director Jay Reinemann, his company’s decision to invest in Coinbase does not indicate that its parent bank is willing to open its doors to bitcoin companies just yet.  Reinemann told CoinDesk:  “This is unfortunately not an announcement that we’re opening up the bank to do that, it’s moreso a precursor. We need to better understand the industry and understand how merchants and consumers are interacting with bitcoin.”  However, Reinemann suggested that such a step could be a possibility in the long term, as BBVA Ventures exists to help the bank understand what its consumers will want in the future, and grow to meet those needs.  “Hopefully that’s something we can participate in in an active way, but first things first, this is about us learning,” Reinemann stressed.  Still, Reinemann indicated the bank is cognizant of the potential opportunity posed by bitcoin and its surrounding ecosystem.  “Crypto holds the possibility for huge disruption in financial services,” Reinemann said. “Obviously, it can be applied to a lot of other things, but that’s something we’re interested in.”  The comments are the latest in what has been a slow trickle of investor comment on the Coinbase funding round, the largest ever completed in the bitcoin space.  A learning experience  Like others involved in the funding round, Reinemann stressed that BBVA’s investment in Coinbase is one that will provide it the ability to educate itself about the ecosystem.  “We’re making these investments to learn, to start the engagement, and we think that through these investments, the bank can do a better job of learning than just sitting on the sidelines, than trying to read about it,” Reinemann said. “It’s about trying to actively participate.”  Reinemann said that in contrast to other businesses in the space, Coinbase will allow it to observe a bitcoin business operating at scale.  Further, Reinemann was also encouraged by Coinbase and its commitment to leading the space with its own educational efforts, citing how the company has so far excelled at regulation and compliance while also providing ease of use.  “I think it’s helping people transact in a way that they’re used to transacting,” Reinemann said of the Coinbase user experience.  Ribbit’s leading influence  Of all the investors in the round, Reinemann talked most passionately about Ribbit Capital, the financial services investment firm of which BBVA Ventures is also a backer.  For example, Reinemann cited Ribbit founder 'Micky' Malka as a influencer that helped encourage it to more directly engage with the bitcoin space through its investment in Coinbase.  “Micky’s been pretty outspoken in the industry and he’s been a great evangelist for the industry,” Reinemann said.  Reinemann also gave credit to portfolio firm 500 Startups, one of the more active incubators in the digital currency space.  Early days  While enthusiastic about the investment, Reinemann continued to emphasize that BBVA Ventures believes the bitcoin ecosystem to still be in its infancy.  Though he called bitcoin “hot from a media perspective”, he suggested that in his view there are still very few merchants and consumers actually using the technology and that the industry needs to work to move past early adopters.  Overall, Reinemann said he believes Coinbase can become a foundational company that helps others find real use cases for bitcoin and empowers others to further explore blockchain technology.  Reinemann concluded:  “It’s still early days, there’s a lot of risk, but we think the opportunity out there is much larger.”  BBVA image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/21/bbva-we-wanted-to-better-understand-the-bitcoin-opportunity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a18867797cf99217822a1b1f93994680f4c24413-1262x529.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
