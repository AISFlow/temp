42411936,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glhDxo,1616713060,"Your NFT Tax Questions, Answered","If you’ve created or bought and sold a non-fungible token (NFT) for a profit over the last 12 months, chances are you probably owe tax to Uncle Sam.  The U.S Internal Revenue Service recently announced it has extended the deadline for individuals filing and paying tax returns from April 15 to May 17, so you now have more time to prepare.  NFTs continue to be the dominant crypto trend of 2021, with 5.5 million sales to date and overall trade volumes totaling more than half a billion dollars. These popular, one-of-a-kind digital assets have drawn worldwide attention, including from major brands like the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) as well as celebrities including William Shatner and Tony Hawk.  Taxable NFT activities  Despite their unique and indivisible nature, all digital assets, including non-fungible tokens, are regarded as “property” for tax purposes per IRS Notice 2014-21. This means that capital gains and losses need to be recorded for the following taxable activities:  Purchasing an NFT using a fungible crypto asset such as binance coin, ether or flow.  Selling an NFT for another NFT.  Selling an NFT for a fungible crypto asset.  Gains and losses are calculated based on the difference between the price paid for the NFT and the price it was sold at. If you used a fungible crypto token to purchase an NFT, you will also need to record the difference between the purchase price of the tokens and the price at disposal.  Example: Jane sees a digital artwork NFT for sale on the Ethereum-based OpenSea platform for two ether (approximately $3,300 at press time) and decides to buy it. Five months later, the artist who created the NFT Jane bought is now trending on social media and there is suddenly huge demand for the artist’s work. Jane decides to capitalize on this and lists her NFT for sale for five ether – which is worth $10,000 at the time. Within minutes, someone buys it from her.  Here’s what Jane now needs to calculate for her tax returns:  The fiat price difference between what she originally purchased her two ether for and the price at which she exchanged the two ether to purchase the NFT. Let’s say Jane purchased her two ether for $450 each over a year ago.  The current price of Jane’s 2 ether = $3,300. The original price she purchased them both for = $900.  $3,300-$900 = $2,400.  Secondly, Jane needs to calculate the fiat difference between the purchase and sale price of the NFT.  Jane initially bought the NFT for $3,300. Jane then sold it on for $10,000.  $10,000 - $3,300 = $6,700  Total gain = $9,100  Long- and short-term capital gains  Because Jane held the ether for over a year, the $2,400 gain would be treated as a long-term capital gain and would incur a lower tax rate of 0%, 15% or 20% depending on her annual or combined marital income. Check out our full U.S. crypto guide here for more information.  Read more: How to Create, Buy and Sell NFTs  The profit Jane made from her NFT sale, however, would be treated as a short-term capital gain as she held the asset less than one year. This means the capital gain will be taxed at the same rate as her income tax bracket. An updated list of U.S. income tax brackets can be found here.  All capital gains and losses need to be recorded on Form 8949 and added to the Schedule D form.  Tip: When calculating capital gains, you can offset the amount of tax you owe by deducting any transaction or gas fees incurred from listing, selling, creating or purchasing the NFT.  It’s worth noting the IRS has a separate tax bracket for collectibles under Code 408(m) that could extend to certain NFTs. This carries a much higher 28% capital gain tax for collectibles held over one year so it is advisable to seek professional assistance from a tax advisor when filing NFT taxes.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,Ollie Leech,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/25/your-nft-tax-questions-answered,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/089e9a7d490f09d72116a2bd0d0d5aacadbf84c0-1067x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386264,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSFG9,1616708351,Want to Buy a Tesla With Bitcoin? It Ain't Easy,"Tesla is not making it attractive to pay for a model S, 3, X or Y in bitcoin.      This week, CEO Elon Musk announced via Twitter (where else?) that his upstart automaker had begun letting interested buyers pay for their electric vehicles in bitcoin. It’s part of a corporate push to acquire as much of the original cryptocurrency as possible – or at least that’s how it seems because the manufacturer has no plans to convert the cryptocurrency to fiat.    But the idiosyncrasies of crypto make it difficult to take advantage of this option. For example, according to the company’s Bitcoin Payment Terms and Conditionshttps://www.tesla.com/assets/pdf/btc_terms_and_conditions_en_US.pdf, bitcoin transactions must be completed within a certain window of time or else the price in BTC expires and the buyer must ask for a new price.    “You have about 30 minutes to make a payment,” a Tesla representative for the Northeast region said Thursday.      While that condition is not surprising given bitcoin’s infamous volatility – depending which direction the price moves, either the car buyer or Tesla could get hosed by a wide swing – it underscores how even in a roaring bull market crypto still struggles to gain widespread acceptance as a payment method.      The fault lies with the native complexities of the Bitcoin system, the U.S. tax policy around cryptocurrencies and, in this case, a paucity of information available from Tesla’s customer support team. (At least, if you’re a member of the press looking for answers.)    No BTC discount    Tesla has been notoriously media-shy after disbanding its public relations department late last year. So after calling headquarters in Palo Alto, Calif., and getting bounced around, and then separately emailing Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn and the black-hole address for press inquiries, this reporter phoned a number of Tesla retailers based in the Northeast and along the West Coast and learned very little about purchasing a vehicle with bitcoin.      “It’s very simple. If they ask about purchasing it, we can assist them with making an appointment,” the Northeast Tesla representative said, unhelpfully. To be fair, a New Jersey resident who is actually in the market for a vehicle said she called a Tesla branch and got all her questions answered.      She told CoinDesk the Paramus-Route 17 gallery accepts bitcoin – though was told flat-out there was no early-adopter’s discount.      But we were able to glean a few telling insights, including the 30-minute payment window.      Another is that Tesla will only accept exact amounts and will not reimburse payments sent to an incorrect alpha-numeric address.      In fact, a bolded passage punctuates the company’s Bitcoin Payment Terms & Conditions document with a warning that includes the following:    ""IF YOU INPUT THE BITCOIN ADDRESS INCORRECTLY, YOUR BITCOIN MAY BE IRRETRIEVABLY LOST OR DESTROYED.”    And...    ""YOU MUST EXERCISE CARE WHEN INPUTTING THE BITCOIN ADDRESS INTO THE RECIPIENT FIELD BECAUSE BITCOIN TRANSACTIONS CANNOT BE REVERSED. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY FAILURE TO ACCURATELY INPUT THE ALPHANUMERIC CODE INTO THE RECIPIENT FIELD.”  ‘Not quite sure’    That document says nothing about tax liabilities, though this is another consideration for U.S. buyers. Under current policy, a purchase of goods or services made with cryptocurrency is a taxable event – even if it’s just a cup of coffee.      That means car buyers must account for potential gains or losses if their bitcoin is worth more or less now than when they first purchased it.      Finally, there are the deflationary incentives in the Bitcoin ecosystem that may discourage potential buyers from spending their coins on cars, or anything. A hard cap of 21 million coins, a decreasing rate of issuance and a growing number of buyers create favorable conditions for the price of BTC to rise, all else equal.      While Lamborghinis have long been the objet petit afor many bitcoiners, those who have made the purchase – or any purchase – often come to regret it. In 2013, someone purchased a $103,000 Tesla Model S Performance for 91.4 BTC. Those coins today would be worth $4.7 million.      Asked whether there has been any interest from HODLers since Musk tweeted this week, the Tesla representative said, “Not quite sure if anything sold yet in bitcoin.”      But another employee sounded excited: “I don't really know that much, and don't want to take on the liability of speaking to the press, to be frank. It’s great news,” the Tesla representative said.

Slipping 4.77% over the previous 24 hours.

Bitcoin traders urged caution as prices for the cryptocurrency slid toward $50,000 for the first time in two weeks while the options market braced for volatility ahead of a record $6 billion contract expiration Friday.      “This is a time to make sure that you have some dry powder and are not overextended,” Chad Steinglass, head of trading at CrossTower, said in an emailed comment. “It seems as though buyers are stepping back, and instead of buying the dip are simply waiting on the sidelines to see what happens.”      Read More: Bitcoin Traders Brace for Record $6B in Options to Expire Friday      The largest cryptocurrency was unchanged to slightly lower Thursday, at around $52,100 as of 19:19 UTC (3:19 p.m. ET). Earlier, prices slid as low as $50,360. Bitcoin hasn’t traded below $50,000 since March 8, well off its all-time high above $61,000.      U.S. stocks were barely higher Thursday, churning below record highs, while Asian and European markets were lower. Some of that weakness could be hampering risk-taking spirits among bitcoin traders.      The U.S. dollar has strengthened recently to new highs in foreign exchange markets. Bitcoin is negatively correlated with the greenback, which means they often trade in opposite directions.      There’s also the monthly expiration looming Friday in the bitcoin options market. Analysts have warned the “max pain” point – where buyers have the most to lose and sellers the most to gain – would occur if the price plunged to around $44,000. The risk is considered remote but plausible.      “We're currently looking for support in the range between $50,000 and $48,000,” Hunain Naseer, senior editor at OKEx Insights, told CoinDesk. “Any concrete signs of recovery are likely to show up after the options expiry on Friday.”      In the meantime, CoinDesk reported Thursday that blockchain data might be turning more bullish: An unusually large number of bitcoins are being withdrawn from cryptocurrency exchanges and going to an illiquid status – possibly an indication they’re being taken down by long-term holders who are unlikely to sell their tokens anytime soon.      Read More: Long-Term Holders Keep Accumulating Bitcoin Amid Latest Sell-Off: Blockchain Data      “Support only holds as long as there are a multitude of large buyers willing to step in if prices decline,” Steinglass said. “We’ll all have to wait and see.”    Ether faces near-term pressure    Ether (ETH) was down on Thursday, trading around $1,605.95 and slipping 1.86% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      A key support level to watch is in the range of $1,500 and $1,600, according to OKEx Insights’ Naseer. If that support fails, a deeper sell-off could ensue.      Ether “has been unable to bounce back in the absence of a strong signal from bitcoin,” he said.      A key factor that analysts are dissecting in the ether market is the role of dollar-pegged stablecoins in the fast-growing digital economy, much of which is centered on the Ethereum blockchain.      Read more: Ethereum’s Transition Could Be Months, Not Years, Away      According to Messari research analyst Ryan Watkins, Ethereum is at risk of becoming “dollarized” because of the prevalence of stablecoins including tether (USDT) and USD coin (USDC).      “Ethereum has dollarized, and the dollar is ultimately controlled by the Federal Reserve, clouding dreams of an independent monetary system,” he wrote.      The market has taken notice, and one solution might be so-called non-pegged stablecoins. By sacrificing a “fixed exchange rate,” one of three points in a triangular currency model known as “the impossible trinity,” a new type of stablecoin might be able to achieve an independent monetary policy.      Watkins explained the concept in this tweet thread.    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly in red Thursday.

In a press release, parent company Avanti Financial Group said Coinbase Ventures, Binance.US, Morgan Creek Digital, Slow Ventures and the University of Wyoming Foundation, among others, participated in the funding round. Avanti has raised $44 million total, the group said.      Avanti said it will put the funds toward meeting regulatory capital requirements and further invest in its engineering team. It gained special-purpose depository institution (SPDI) status in October, joining fellow Wyoming-based crypto firm Kraken as one of the few digital companies with the banking charter.      At the time, CEO Caitlin Long told CoinDesk that Avanti needed to raise more capital before it could receive a certificate of authority to operate.      Avanti is preparing to launch later this year, Long said in the press release.      “A lot of people and crypto-native companies of all stripes, exchanges, traders, lenders, banks and also a number of non-crypto companies have also actively reached out to us because they understand [CTO] Bryan Bishop and his team have different capabilities” than traditional banks, Long said in an interview.      Avanti’s final pre-launch task will be getting clearance to bank with the Federal Reserve, Long said.      “Plugging crypto directly into the us dollar payment system, that has never been done before,” she added.      ""Many look at our statutory requirement of $5 million, but I can tell you it is actually far in excess of that,"" Wyoming Division of Banking Commissioner Albert Forkner told CoinDesk via email.

CryptoKitties creator Dapper Labs began working with Alchemy a few years back. So the partnership announced Thursday will provide the same support for Flow, the home of NBA Top Shot. The latter accounts for more transactions than all the other NFT projects combined, according to Dapper Labs CEO Roham Gharegozlou.      Alchemy, a kind of Amazon Web Services (AWS) for powering blockchains, also provides developers with the ""picks and shovels"" to easily build more user-friendly services. This typically means tools to debug their code, increase performance and allow better transparency.      “When you open Uber or Netflix or Airbnb, that infrastructure is powered by AWS underneath the hood. And alchemy does the same for accessing blockchains,” Alchemy CEO Nikil Viswanathan said in an interview.

Effect Network developers said Thursday the main reason for the shift to BSC, a smart contract-based blockchain backed by exchange giant Binance, is due to concerns about the future of the EOS blockchain and its leadership.      In January, serial blockchain entrepreneur and EOS CTO Dan Larimer left Block.one ""to pursue new personal projects.""      Effect Network cites ""unfulfilled promises to address the many issues that plague the EOS mainnet"" prior to Larimer’s departure as motivating factors for its search for greener pastures. The team claims its network, which purports to be building the ""decentralized Future of Work,"" is the ""most-used and largest project"" on the EOS mainnet to date, with clients including Kraft Heinz, Linus Tech Tips and the United Nations. The team cautions that with Effect's departure this may well mean ""the end of applications with real use cases on the EOS chain.""    Why BSC?    Effect Network CEO Chris Dawe explained the move to BSC is due to his confidence in the long-term vision of the Binance ecosystem.      ""Look at what the Binance organization has accomplished in only the last three years. It is a testament of dedication, hard work but above all its laser-focused vision. The amount of products and services our clients and workforce can tap into with the Binance ecosystem are amazing and will help accelerate the growth of the Effect Network like never before,"" said Dawe.

42386265,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSFHP,1616698261,US Bitcoin Exchanges See No Major Uptick in Stimulus-Related Buying,"Cryptocurrency exchanges aren't seeing a much-anticipated surge in bitcoin (BTC) purchases by retail customers using the $1,400 stimulus checks they received from the U.S. government as part of President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill.      The news might come as a disappointment to bitcoin bulls who speculated the latest round of ""stimmy checks"" might push up bitcoin prices past $60,000 or beyond. The cryptocurrency is down 11% this week after slipping 2.8% last week. It is changing hands at press time around $51,300.      The checks are still being distributed, so it might be too early to call the hyped-up episode a dud. But that's what it looks like so far. The Japanese brokerage firm Mizuho relied on a survey to estimate earlier this month that some $40 billion of the latest round of direct stimulus checks could be spent on bitcoin and stocks.      Read more: Nearly $40B in US Stimulus Checks May Be Spent on Bitcoin and Stocks: Mizuho Survey      ""While it is too early to comment on the amount of money coming to our platform from the recent stimulus, we'd note that during the previous stimulus fundings, we saw significant deposits with like amounts to the individual stimulus checks,"" Steve Ehrlich, CEO of Voyager, a U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, told CoinDesk in an email sent by a spokesperson.      An earlier round of stimulus resulted in a spike in deposits that were exactly the same amount as the $1,200 stimulus check at the time, according to an April 2020 tweet by Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S.      The tweet has since been deleted, and Coinbase declined to comment on the latest round of stimulus due to the regulatory ""quiet period"" leading up to its public market debut. Fortunately, the tweet was preserved as a screenshot:      So the question is: Why aren't the exchanges seeing the flow?      It could be that retail traders are taking a pause after bidding up high-flying tech stocks and cryptocurrencies over the past few months. Trading volumes in call options of stocks favored by members of Reddit's WallStreetBets forum are down, according to Bloomberg.      The retail trader retreat could also be driven by macro-economic factors. Consumers are more comfortable with spending cash as the U.S. economy recovers from a pandemic-induced recession. Credit card spending among millennials spiked over the past month, according to data from JPMorgan. And that cash hasn't made its way to cryptocurrency exchanges.      It's also possible that bitcoin's doubling in prices has made the cryptocurrency look more expensive to prospective buyers.      There's still a chance a bitcoin-buying bonanza could materialize: The U.S. Internal Revenue Service expects the next batch of stimulus payments to be issued this week.      But so far? Not much to report.      Kraken, a U.S. based cryptocurrency exchange, also told CoinDesk it hasn't seen a significant uptick in $1,400 purchases.

42386259,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSF9r,1616691041,Crypto Must Apply Safety Lessons of the Existing Financial System,"There is a revealing, albeit slightly morbid, maxim that “safety standards are written in blood.” Humans and human-created systems generally tend to be reactive rather than proactive when it comes to developing protective rules. Nevertheless, today’s construction workers and consumers are more shielded from danger than those of the past because we’ve learned from prior mistakes.    Rick McDonell was the executive secretary of the Financial Action Task Force from 2007 until 2016. Prior to that, he was chief of the United Nations Global Program against Money Laundering at the UNODC. He is now executive director of ACAMS, the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists.    The same dynamic exists in financial regulation, where it could be said that “financial standards are written in fraud.” For example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission didn’t exist in the first iterations of the stock market. It was only after ""Black Tuesday,"" the 1929 stock market crash so severe that it was a major contributing factor to the Great Depression, that new laws and regulations were introduced that continue to define modern finance. But the world has morphed into two: the real world and the virtual world. The old rules do not suit either of them.      See also: FATF Says It Is Open to Amending Crypto Travel Rule Guidance      Parts of the cryptocurrency industry have been culturally slow to accept and implement compliance requirements of the existing (traditional) financial system. This extends from basic know-your-customer (KYC) protocols to the more challenging requirements of the ""Travel Rule."" Companies offering services in the crypto industry – commonly called “virtual asset service providers,” or VASPs – need to comply in full force and spirit with global anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing conventions or risk being sanctioned or shut out by regulators or criminally pursued by law enforcement if they intentionally breach the law in jurisdictions in which they reside or operate.      Practically speaking, governments have very little incentive to change the rules to accommodate crypto but have significant incentive to insist on a level playing field with traditional financial institutions. While cryptocurrencies and virtual assets are digital, the reality is that VASPs still need to operate out of countries. Governments might be behind the curve on crypto but they are quickly catching up, and VASPs should be prepared to be held to the same standards as the rest of the financial system.      For example, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a U.S.-based regulator that is also a bellwether of global financial regulatory enforcement, recently proposed lowering the threshold of the Travel Rule from $3,000 to $250.      See also: Campbell-Verduyn/Moritz Hutten - Is the Travel Rule Good or Bad for Crypto? Both      The Travel Rule requires financial institutions transferring money across international borders to collect and share certain information about the sender and recipient. It is a key tool in the fight against money laundering, terrorism financing, transnational criminal activity and fraud. VASPs that create on-ramps to the crypto economy, enabling the exchange of fiat money for crypto, are clearly a critical link in effective enforcement of the Travel Rule.      It is not lost on regulators that cryptocurrencies, with an ability to transmit value instantly outside the rails of the traditional financial system, present special challenges when it comes to complying with this rule. The existing financial system sits within a reporting framework that enables enforcement of the Travel Rule. Crypto does not.    VASPs should be prepared to be held to the same standards as the rest of the financial system.    Beyond the hundreds of active distributed protocols transferring millions of dollars worth of digital currencies every second, many blockchains tie up value in complex arrangements like decentralized finance (DeFi), layer 2 protocols, sidechains and smart contracts. It is no small challenge to retrofit a system designed for information sharing between centralized, regulated entities to a web of decentralized networks where anyone with an internet connection can participate.      That doesn’t absolve VASPs of responsibility. On the contrary, it makes their participation in enforcing existing rules all the more critical.      Crypto has a perception problem in many countries – created in part by a historical association with ransomware extortionists, exchange hacks, dark web merchants and sanction-evading nations. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently expressed concerns over bitcoin’s association with illicit activities. In a recent survey, more than half of respondents among government and financial compliance professionals said crypto was a risk to the financial system, yet 80% of crypto industry insiders viewed crypto as an opportunity. Clearly, there is much more work to be done to close the gap.      See also: Inside the Standards Race for Implementing FATF’s Travel Rule      Vocal support from VASPs for a consistent, regulatory regime, such as one outlined by industry advocacy group Coin Center, is one step that industry supporters could take to demonstrate a commitment to legitimacy.      On the other hand, governments should be aggressive in prosecuting VASPs that resist regulatory oversight. The recent enforcement action brought against Tether demonstrates why regulators need to shine a spotlight on this area. In this arena, there is little difference from the traditional finance world. Pursuing bad actors improves faith in the entire system, and deters potential criminal activity in the future.      If VASPs take the concerns of regulators seriously and demonstrate concerted, good-faith efforts to comply with the international financial crime enforcement regime, governments will be more willing to recognize the legitimate, unique benefits cryptocurrencies offer: accessibility, financial inclusion, programmable money and more.      The modern global financial system is one of humanity’s greatest feats of social and economic engineering, centuries in the making. Despite its flaws, it has helped foster an unprecedented era of global economic activity and stability. If the cryptocurrency industry and governments can work together to apply the lessons learned in the painstaking development of the current system, the financial system of the future will be more fair, more productive, more efficient and more accessible than ever before.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Rick McDonell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/03/25/crypto-must-apply-safety-lessons-of-the-existing-financial-system,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/497313d9fd3cc4de9d47f46a62780b3fc8b1ca94-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It might not be a coincidence that the agency plans to sell more than $300,000 worth of bitcoin at an auction next week.      According to an announcement posted Wednesday on the agency's website, the GSA is offering commission-free bidding on 6.79 BTC, divided into 10 lots. On Thursday, bitcoin was changing hands around $50,800, so the total amount set for auction works out to roughly $345,000. The auction will take place on the GSA Auctions website, starting on March 29 at 5 p.m. ET.      ""Get ready for cryptocurrency spring fever on GSA Auctions,"" according to the press release. ""It’s time to let your bitcoin portfolio bloom by placing a winning bid during GSA Auctions’ upcoming cryptocurrency sale.""      The auction comes just weeks after the GSA conducted its first auction of bitcoin – a chunk of 0.7501 BTC that went for $53,104.    While the federal government has been auctioning bitcoin since 2014, this will be the second time cryptocurrency is being sold using GSA Auctions.  The previous auction took place on March 17 with 31 bidders. The winning bid was at $53,104 at 0.7501 BTC. That works out to $70,796 for a full bitcoin – more than 20% over the market price of about $59,000 on March 17. So it wasn't exactly a bargain. But the government apparently got a good price.  “Our first steps wading into the cryptocurrency market quickly became one of our hottest auctions of 2021, but it was really just a test run for our latest bitcoin auction,” Thomas Meiron, regional commissioner for GSA’s Federal Acquisition Service, said in the press release.  “We expect this auction will generate even more excitement among cryptocurrency investors,” Meiron said.

42386228,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSBfT,1616689036,The Node: Bitcoin Is 'Armageddon Insurance'?,"Yesterday, Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla will hold any bitcoin it brings in from paying customers (instead of converting that BTC to fiat). And it appears the future king of Mars is building a bitcoin stockpile to last through the ages.      This got me thinking whether Earth-bound sovereigns would ever put “bitcoin on the balance sheet,” as the saying goes.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Under what scenarios would a government follow Tesla and decide to buy bitcoin?      I put the question to James Angel, an associate professor at Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business, who specializes in global financial markets.      Here’s what he said:      First, call him Jim.      Second, most rich, developed, western governments are unlikely to ever add bitcoin to their balance sheets. Bitcoin is a private competitor to their “seigniorage franchises.” If it ever catches on – like really catches on beyond Elon Musk’s imaginary moon colony – “they’ll have to tax people in other ways,” Angel said.      In fact, governments ""might be happy if it went away entirely,” he said. “There is a long, long, long history of governments shooing aside private currencies.”      Rogue states likely already hold some bitcoin, but not in the same way that MicroStrategy, Tesla or Square do, Angel said. Nations like North Korea or Venezuela view cryptocurrency as a way to evade sanctions, similar to how bitcoin has become a dominant medium of transaction on the dark web (after credit cards, of course).      See also: ‘Ship-to-Ship’ Trade and Other Secrets of North Korea’s Illicit $1.5B Crypto Stash      Governments plugged into the fiat-based, global financial system are unlikely to reap any of the uncensorable benefits bitcoin provides. And while bitcoin is a comparatively cheap way to move large amounts of capital, Angel thinks governments have gotten hip to the “technological revolution” and will have their own stablecoin-like central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) online soon.      But what of the digital gold narrative? Of course no government would hold bitcoin to transact with – no, people do that!      Well, Angel invites us to consider why there are places like Fort Knox or crypts below the Bank of England. In other words, why do governments hoard gold?      “It’s Armageddon insurance,” Angel said. Under a scenario where it becomes too risky to accept dollars or pound sterling, when lenders stop lending, gold becomes a backstop. Fiat currencies are relatively new innovations in the history of money, a departure from centuries of commerce conducted in the yellow metal.      But it’s an expensive hedge. “You have to store it and protect it,” Angel said. Governments are willing to tie up resources (tax resources) because of gold’s history. Bitcoin, newer than fiat currencies, would be a cheaper and potentially more secure way to hold state reserves, but it comes with an added risk of the blockchain’s future.      “It’s an option on the future that you will have a solid blockchain that someone will figure out a need for,” Angel said. He’s skeptical on that front.      The last wrinkle: Governments also hold foreign asset reserves. According to our Virgil, leading us through the scenarios of monetary Armageddon, this is mostly a vanity project. Nations hold other countries' currencies to show they’re able to support their own local money.      If, say, the lira becomes weak, Turkey can purchase foreign assets as a way to stabilize local prices. “If you run out of foreign reserves, your currency plummets,” Angel said.      So why not bitcoin? It is, by some measures, the third-largest world currency. Well, Angel points to the cost-benefit analysis some CIA official has probably war-gamed. If bitcoin receives a state stamp of approval, it opens up a whole host of issues (like the taxation considerations above).      Further, as EY’s Blockchain Lead Paul Brody put it: “Lots of governments hold dollars as a reserve asset both because of the asset value/stability over time but also because a lot of key international trade assets like oil are priced in dollars.”      That isn’t necessarily the case for bitcoin. As Carnegie Mellon Associate Professor of Economics Ariel Zetlin-Jones notes, “The enormous volatility in day-to-day price changes associated with cryptocurrencies shows no sign of slowing.”      That’s part of the reason why programs to collect taxes in crypto, such as in Ohio, have been wound down. Also, why agencies like the U.S. General Services Administration or U.S. Marshals Service that come into possession of bitcoin through criminal asset seizures or other means, auction it off.      Last year, it was unthinkable that a public company would issue several rounds of debt to buy bitcoin. Today, there’s MicroStrategy. I’m not sure anything is off the table when it comes to bitcoin.

42376236,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwL5Y9,1616688007,Microsoft’s ION Digital ID Network Is Live on Bitcoin,"A radical new framework for how to authenticate online identities just went live on the Bitcoin network.  Microsoft’s Decentralized Identity team has launched the ION Decentralized Identifier (DID) network on the Bitcoin mainnet. This network is a layer 2 technology similar to Lightning except that instead of focusing on payments it uses Bitcoin’s blockchain to create digital IDs for authenticating identity online.  An ID network like ION could be the key to unlocking a web where users no longer have to fumble with passwords, emails and cell phones for verification.  “We are excited to share that [version 1] of ION is complete and has been launched on Bitcoin mainnet. We have deployed an ION node to our production infrastructure and are working together with other companies and organizations to do so as well. ION does not rely on centralized entities, trusted validators or special protocol tokens. ION answers to no one but you, the community,” Microsoft’s Daniel Buchner writes in a blog post.  What is Microsoft’s ION?  As noted by Buchner, ION is open source, so anyone can download the code and run an ION node to use the service. It uses Sidetree, an open-source protocol for decentralized identifiers built by devs from Microsoft, ConsenSys, Mattr and Transmute.  Open to the public after being in closed beta since June 2020, ION uses the same logic as Bitcoin’s transaction layers to sign off on identity. A public key and its associated private key are used to verify that a user owns an ID.  For example, to log into your email or social media in a world that uses ION, you would verify you own your account by ""signing"" your DID with your ION account. Thanks to the cryptographic links that ION creates to Bitcoin, the ION network would verify for the service provider that you own the ID associated with your account.  Any personal data (name, age, etc) tied to that ID is stored off-chain, depending on the service. ION’s IDs are anchored to Bitcoin’s blockchain using the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) protocol, and ION nodes can process up to 10,000 ID requests in a single transaction.  Users can create and manage multiple IDs with different keys for different services. Some of these may be used recurrently to log into services that users access daily including email and social media, or could be used in one-off ways such as verifying concert or event tickets.  Anyone interested in running ION can do so through a remote node or by downloading it directly on a native device.  Microsoft has developed an application programming interface (API) for developers who would like to interact with the service without downloading a node or wallet. The company has also built an explorer for looking up DIDs created on the network.  With version 1 launched, the team will focus on releasing a “light client” for bootstrapping nodes faster and streamlining ID resolution by authorizing an ID while its related transaction is still in Bitcoin’s mempool.  Are decentralized IDs the future?  Microsoft’s ION has attracted contributions from Bitcoin and crypto mainstays including Casa, ConsenSys, Gemini, BitPay and Protocol Labs, as well as a hand from the teams at Cloudflare, Spruce and others.  ION has also worked with the Transmute and SecureKey teams who are building their own DID networks.  Decentralized Identity is a good example of a non-monetary use case for public blockchains like Bitcoin, and it’s even on the radar of the World Economic Forum’s blockchain chief. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), a body for web standards founded in 1994), is currently evaluating DIDs as a candidate recommendation, meaning the forum is considering recognizing these identity frameworks as an international standard.  Blockchain Commons head and crypto veteran Christopher Allen told CoinDesk in 2019 that Microsoft embracing Bitcoin’s properties for DIDs is “a step in the right direction.”  “You could have a service that is in the cloud hosted by Microsoft Azure, but is absolutely secure because everything in it is encrypted with your keys that you control and everything that run under your authority, even though it’s in the cloud,” Allen said.

To digital-market analysts, it's a bullish signal traders or investors might be preparing to hold their BTC for the long term.    More than 1,365 BTCs were removed from cryptocurrency exchanges during the 24 hours through 12:00 UTC Thursday, the highest for a 24-hour period so far this year, according to the blockchain data firm Glassnode.  The spike in withdrawals from exchange addresses came as the No. 1 cryptocurrency by market capitalization slumped on Thursday to near $50,000, from a high at $56,783.86 in the past 24 hours.  ""Today we have a new all-time high in BTC leaving the exchanges for 2021 and a new dip-buying prize to award,"" bitcoin analyst Willy Woo tweeted Thursday.  At the same time, more coins are being withdrawn to an illiquid status, separate blockchain data show.  The monthly net change of supply held by liquid and highly liquid entities have pushed into deeply negative levels, to a degree not seen in three years, according to Glassnode. (See chart above.)  That might be related to many investors' growing use of bitcoin as a hedge against inflation in the face of trillions of dollars of monetary stimulus pumped into global financial markets over the past year by central banks around the world.  ""The trend of coins withdrawn and locked away into long-term holding patterns is a direct response to the world's central bank response to 2020,"" Glassnode wrote in its newsletter earlier this month.

42386224,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSBWf,1616682924,Staked Introduces Eth 2.0 Trust for Accredited Investors,"A blockchain startup has created an investment trust that will allow individuals to bet on the next generation of Ethereum, with interest.      The blockchain behind the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market value is scheduled at some point over the next year or so for an upgrade, to Ethereum 2.0. One benefit for investors is they can receive “staking rewards,” similar to interest payments, from the upgrade. In this case, that works out to about 8% annually.      The new Staked Eth Trust lets accredited investors tap into those rewards with the ease of buying a stock. It joins a cottage industry of new trusts and exchange-traded products aiming to give investors in traditional markets a way of betting on cryptocurrencies, without the hassle of having to buy the digital assets directly.      “An investor in the trust gets the benefit of exposure to ether, plus the rewards from staking that ether without having to purchase it, custody it and stake it independently. It's all handled by the trust,” CEO Tim Ogilvie told CoinDesk in an interview.      The product will be available for accredited investors for the time being, as are other crypto-focused funds including the Grayscale Trust suite or Bitwise’s index funds. Grayscale, the world’s largest cryptocurrency asset manager, is a unit of Digital Currency Group, the owner of CoinDesk.      However, the Staked Eth Trust sits more squarely in line with other Eth 2.0 financial products such as Lido Finance’s liquid staking or Coinbase’s Beacon Chain ether (BETH). Those products remain walled off from institutional players given the high degree of crypto-specific knowledge needed to implement them.      “As you see a lot of institutional interest in bitcoin, I think a very natural next step is how does Ethereum work? There are a bunch of investors who believe that the risk/return on Ethereum is significantly higher than that on Bitcoin,” Ogilvie said. “If Eth 2.0 successfully pulls off what they say they are going to do, you have this combination of a supply that is shrinking all the time plus the fact you can stake it and earn yield on top of that.”",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/25/staked-introduces-eth-20-trust-for-accredited-investors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/185e31b48737f04a598bda44bb2fcdf06613a20f-1501x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Per an announcement shared with CoinDesk, the Solana Foundation, a governing body for the solana proof-of-stake protocol and coin (SOL), is partnering with the southeast Asian exchanges to fund developers and projects building on the platform.      “The [decentralized finance] ecosystem on Solana is strong and growing rapidly. Our focus is to offer the best possible experience to users, teams building on Solana and partners in the ecosystem. The Solana Foundation will continue to support innovative new approaches to DeFi around the world,” Solana Foundation President Anatoly Yakovenko told CoinDesk.    Read more: Solana: Blockchain Developers Are Focused on the Wrong Problem    OKEx will make its investment through its newly founded Block Dream Fund, while MXC is making its investment straight up. The exchanges will receive equity in the form of tokens for their investments. Developers or teams who would like to apply for funding can do so here.      “MXC’s investments within the Solana Ecosystem will focus on expanding [non-fungible token] support and product-centered projects building on Solana. Our fund looks for projects developing technology-focused solutions in DeFi and other emerging fields,” Katherine Deng, the vice president of MXC, told CoinDesk.    Solana: Another 'Ethereum-killer' contender?    One of the top dogs in a pack of Ethereum competitors that have cropped up in the past few years, Solana’s proof-of-stake platform uses validators to process transactions. Founded by a team of ex-Intel, Dropbox and Qualcomm engineers, the blockchain is pitched as a faster, cheaper alternative to Ethereum.      Solana is young but growing, with one of its new-gen DeFi projects, Oxygen, receiving $40 million in funding from the likes of Alameda, Multicoin and Genesis Capital. The network hosts a “decentralized exchange” run by FTX, houses its own novel DeFi projects and has even attracted the interest of the companies behind stablecoins USDC and USDT.      The network is one of many so-called “ETH killers,” as their fan bases like to call them, which offer smart-contract applications for similar DeFi use cases. Anticipating Ethereum’s own migration to proof-of-stake, these rivals almost always use some PoS design, which uses validators in place of miners to process transactions.    Read more: What Is Proof-of-Stake    OKEx Block Dream Fund founder Dora told CoinDesk that the fund will include $100 million in total. Some of this will go toward Solana, but other chunks of the funding will go toward other public blockchain projects, layer 2 technology and other DeFi building blocks like derivatives markets and oracles.      “Our mission is to explore the best blockchain projects around the world and promote sustainable development across the entire industry,” Dora told CoinDesk. “Additionally, we will help our invested projects to establish valuable connections with trading platforms.

42386234,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSBkV,1616679739,Coinbase and ZenGo Spar Over QR Code Standards That Could Strand ERC-20 Tokens,"Small problems, compounded by a lack of developer coordination, can have a huge impact on the safety of crypto users’ coins.      Case in point:      Wednesday, the head of security at ZenGo, a cryptocurrency wallet provider, tweeted out research showing that issues with QR codes generated by Coinbase.com's app had resulted in some users sending funds to the contract address rather than to the intended wallet address within the app. This error effectively strands the funds, with no way to reverse the transaction.      The QR code issue ZenGo identified is based on a backward-compatibility issue between ERC-67 (the original QR URL format standard) and the newer EIP-681 standard. Coinbase uses EIP-681, creating compatibility issues between it and other wallets using the older standard.      “QR codes are a very problematic format for the cryptocurrency domain,” said Tal Be'ery, co-founder and security researcher at ZenGo. “As QR codes are not humanly readable, it’s hard for users to detect errors, introduced either by malice or by mistake. Due to the irreversibility of cryptocurrency, errors are usually fatal.”      That being said, QR codes can be more reliable and less prone to error overall than a human copying and pasting a wallet address.      This issue has affected some users within the last eight months and, according to Be’ery has likely been around longer. It was publicly reported in December 2020 as well.    The EIP and ERC QR code standards    ZenGo discovered the issue as part of its quality assurance process. Be’ery said the team was testing the ZenGo QR decoding module by feeding it QR codes, generated by a variety of wallets, and noticed the ZenGo app does not handle Coinbase app QRs for ERC-20 tokens, such as tether or dai.      ERC-20 tokens can typically be used to represent objects, give voting rights, pay transaction fees, crowdfund and incorporate new features into a token. ERC-20 is currently the most popular ERC token standard on Ethereum.    Read more: What Is the ERC-20 Ethereum Token Standard?    Once QR codes are decoded according to the older QR code URL standard used by ZenGo, the URL appears in the address field below the QR code as, essentially, “ethereum:<address>” followed by some optional parameters.      In the newer format, supported by Coinbase's app, the decoded URL appears below the QR code as “ERC-20 ethereum:<contract address>/transfer?address=<recipient address>“.      This means that if developers are not careful with their implementation, an algorithm may decide to just take the first parameter as the relevant address to send to and ignore all others, according to Be’ery.      “When this ‘naive’ algorithm is applied on the newer format, it will cause the wallet user to erroneously send funds to the ERC-20 contract itself and not the intended recipient, resulting in money loss,” said Be’ery.      Be'ery tweeted out an example from Coinbase's app, with the first address being the contract address rather than the wallet address.    The EIP-681 standardhttps://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-681%23backwards-compatibility documentation acknowledges this problem, essentially stating that it’s backwards compatible for ETH but not ERC-20 payments.  Read more: We Went Hunting for Crypto Scams in Google and Apple App Stores. Here’s What We Found  'A terrible standard'    Coinbase did not supply a requested comment by press time but Pete Kim, head of engineering for the Coinbase Wallet replied to Be’ery’s tweet.      Be’ery said while Coinbase is not “wrong” because it is following some standard, the team at ZenGo believes it’s a classic case of ""It’s better to be smart than to be right.""      “When implementing a cross-wallet functionality such as QR codes that can be created by one wallet and consumed by another it’s better to use a ‘lowest common denominator’ attitude,” said Be’ery.      “Specifically, ZenGo creates QR codes which encode the address in a raw format (Trust wallet does it, too) that just specifies the address and nothing else. It’s basic and therefore leaves less room for mistakes and incompatibilities.”      Kim later corrected himself, noting that the new standard was being used on Coinbase's retail app, or their exchange app, rather than Coinbase Wallet, which is a noncustodial wallet app.      Kim went on to say this was a bug in ZenGo for not supporting the EIP-681 standard, noting that other wallets like Trust, Exodus, Crypto.com and Metamask all support EIP-681 correctly.    Choosing the right address    In the meantime, as a general rule, Be’ery said users who must use QR codes should verify transaction details before finally confirming the transaction. For example, searching an address on Etherscan will tell you whether the address is a contract address or a wallet address. Unfortunately checking which standards your preferred wallet supports is quite difficult.      All this may seem arduous for newcomers to the space who are unfamiliar with the contours of crypto, and it can be. However, it's something that may save them quite a bit of money and headaches in the long run.      “That’s why in ZenGo we augment our QR codes with some visual indicators on the coin/token type and also the address itself for easy comparison and verification,” Be'ery said.      ""The most important thing with QR code reading is not getting confused by the different formats and standards, and it's better to fail in case of an unsupported format (as we do) and not try to 'guess' and put our customers' funds at risk. We may decide in future to support this format too, and then we will pick the 'right' address, so no funds [will be lost].""      Correction: Thursday, March 3, 2021, 16:00 UTC: The original version of this article stated that the issue was with the Coinbase Wallet.

The test demonstrates that new technologies and conventional payment systems can work to settle securities in central bank money without relying on a central bank digital currency (CBDC).      In conjunction with Deutsche Börse and the German Finance Energy, the Bundesbank announced Wednesday that, for demonstration purposes, the test had created a 10-year government bond issued using distributed ledger technology (DLT) with subsequent trading in primary and secondary markets settled in the same system.      It then developed a ""trigger solution,"" and connected the DLT securities system with the eurosystem's large-value payment system TARGET2. In this interface, a ""trigger"" is initiated when a transaction has been settled on the DLT system, signaling to TARGET2 that money can change hands.      The project invovled a number of market participants, including Barclays, Citibank, Commerzbank, DZ Bank, Goldman Sachs and Société Générale.

42386237,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSBn1,1616676720,The Real Problem With Crypto,"The problem with crypto is not that it is a scam. Or a bubble. Or used in any significant way today to evade taxes and finance terrorism.      The problem with crypto is it presents a viable alternative to monetary monopolies by national governments. A viable alternative to banks and other financial institutions. A viable alternative to intermediated exchange.    Pondering Durian is a tech-focused investor and writer who explores connections involving the U.S., China, and Emerging Asia (India and Southeast Asia) in the Emerging newsletter and blog.    The real problem – for politicians, nation-states and the less tech-savvy and affluent within their borders – is that holding non-sovereign, algorithmically scarce digital assets today may be a better vehicle to protect one’s future purchasing power than fiat backed by nation-states. The sky-rocketing prices of BTC and ETH are evidence of many reaching a similar conclusion. The shift in power between hierarchy and networks is underway.      “But Pondering,” you plead, “Divorcing monetary sovereignty from nation-states is a bit far-fetched, don’t you think? Surely, you don’t mean to suggest we are heading for a cliché ‘sovereign individual-esk’ world where nations lose control of their own monetary policy to ... distributed algorithms? I mean, sure – the internet has challenged faith in institutions and boosted the relative power of networks and polarized populations. But Pondering, let’s be real. The power of governments has never been more secure. Please, stop the hyperbole”      To which I respond: EXACTLY. Which is why this crypto stuff is so wild. It’s why Act 3 of the internet may be the most dramatic yet.      In a way, the demise of the current financial system was embedded within its own creation. The real question was always: “What comes next?”    The Triffin dilemma    Robert Triffin was a 1960s economist who highlighted the paradox of a single nation’s currency serving as the reserve currency for the globe. In short, the inflated international demand for the reserve currency (U.S. dollars, in this case) to conduct trade and host FX reserves will lead to structural trade deficits for the issuer.      While an inflated value for the dollar makes imports cheaper, the cost is less competitive exports and mounting deficits. In its effort to supply the world with needed dollars, the U.S. has squeezed many of its own industries offshore, propelled inequality within its borders and fostered the return of more extreme politics.    It’s why Act 3 of the internet may be the most dramatic yet.    In many ways, the deficits of the U.S. are structural in nature. The U.S. now accounts for about 15% of global GDP, but the dollar still accounts for more than 50% of international trade. With a population of abouty 330 million on a globe of approximately 7.9 billion people, the writing was on the wall from the start. It took until 2021 but the petro-dollar system is starting to show cracks.      A decade of stimulus, accelerating deficits and $6+ trillion in COVID-19 relief spending are bringing questions of sustainability to the forefront. Just last week, Bridgewater’s Ray Dalio penned: “Why in the world would you own bonds when … bond markets offer ridiculously low yields?”      The sad reality is real returns on government debt have gone negative – you are literally guaranteed to lose purchasing power holding these assets. International demand for Treasury bonds is drying up at the exact moment governments are accelerating new issuances. With over $75 trillion in U.S. debts outstanding and rising by the day, buyers are beginning to flinch.      If you are a boomer, the status quo of inflated asset prices and entitlement spending is someone else’s problem. Just a few more kicks of the can. However, millennials are taking in this macro portrait and quietly asking: “Does this rickety scaffolding really have another 30-40 years? How does this play out?”      Looking at my social media feed, I can’t help but notice the relentless barrage of “money printer go brrrr” memes, a disdain for institutions and #Bitcoin hashtags burned into the minds of young people as if to say:      “Do you really want to be holding the bag when the trillions in debt, entitlement spending and monetary shenanigans come due from propping up the asset prices and lifestyle of the boomer generation? Are you really going to sit here and take decades of decreasing purchasing power on the chin as governments inflate away debts that benefited others?”      See also: Sofia Blikstad - MMT, Crypto and the New Nature of Money      I’m not saying it’s right or wrong. I’m just saying it’s viral.      One of the leading indicators of inflation is increasing expectations of inflation. Social media algorithms have been finely tuned to spread these exact messages of fear and greed like wildfire. Small matches have already been lit in many fringe communities online.      Taking in this increasingly precarious scaffolding, young people have started looking around for an exit. Like a just-in-time liferaft, the budding world of cryptocurrencies has emerged as an early favorite.      So here we find our millennial protagonists squeezed between 1) a rigged financial system and a controlled yield curve likely to destroy their future purchasing power, and 2) a risky, unproven libertarian experiment taking on the most powerful institutions on Earth.      Rock, hard place.    A tale of two cities    But which one is better?      On the one hand, the existing monetary regime is surprisingly regressive. Artificially depressed rates and cheap debt disadvantage the working class whose wages struggle to keep up with inflation – especially inflation in financial assets – benefitting investors/financiers at the expense of labor. Dovish monetary policy, globalization and automation are a three-headed monster rampaging through the blue-collar towns of western democracies claiming ever more territory for the expanding “rust belt.”      On the other hand, there is a budding “internet of value” built on distributed systems and cryptography, promising users an alternative to today’s “rigged” system. A system based on transparency, individual sovereignty, and a return to hard money principles with a deflationary currency like bitcoin at its core. A system promising to end the unsustainable fractional reserve banking excess of fiat and the regressive outcomes they encourage.      See also: Pondering Durian - Why >15% of My Net Worth Is in Bitcoin      Similar to the power-laws of the internet, I imagine a new crypto-centric financial system would be ruthlessly meritocratic, allocating resources to those who truly create value for others in a market-based economy on a global scale. The difference is the value-capture is now native to cyberspace and harder to redistribute for the large swaths within a nation’s borders who will struggle to compete in this brave new world.      Cutting out intermediaries is a double-edged sword. Sure, you can cut out banks, bankers and Big Tech from levying high fees and taxes on peer-to-peer transactions. A popular remedy, no doubt.      However, what happens when more wealth is stored in non-domiciled smart contract platforms or decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) – accruing value in the decentralized web, away from the reaches of the nation-state, the primary vehicle of redistribution? I imagine that will be decidedly less popular, especially in developed economies where populations have grown accustomed to transfer payments.      In a world where crypto succeeds as a nation-state resistant store of value (a big if), the most talented, most connected, most tech-savvy individuals globally will thrive to a degree never before seen. Inequality between the “haves” and the “have nots” will yawn further and votes towards ever greater redistribution will be increasingly impotent.    Taking in this increasingly precarious scaffolding, young people have started looking around for an exit.    So, friends, we find ourselves here: a broken, regressive financial system whose only realistic path to paying off its massive debts is devaluing the currency, which will only further accelerate the adoption of a new hyper-meritocratic crypto-economy that will likely lead to further social unrest.      I obviously expect nation-states to put up a fight, which is why crypto assets are still sublimely “risky.” Yet, governments will find themselves in a bind. As several have noted, governments can’t actually ban crypto assets. They can only ban their own constituents from owning them, pushing the innovation (and the financial gains) of the internet’s next iteration to the shores of geopolitical rivals.      The game theory for national leaders is a nightmare.    The real problem (for governments)    The next 10 years or so will be wild, but it’s impossible to put the genie back in the bottle. Crypto is here to stay. Instead of the hourly price updates from resident cheerleaders on Twitter, more people should be asking:      What would a crypto-denominated world actually look like?      Many people in emerging markets will be less subject to corrupt politicians and fiscal mismanagement that is still too fresh in the minds of many in Southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa. No longer would political negligence or corruption destroy citizens’ life savings. Financial access would be equal opportunity.      See also: Michael Casey - Why Quantitative Easing Is Here to Stay      On the other hand, equal opportunity from quite uneven starting points in a game without a referee to smooth out outcomes. Despite all the talk in decentralized finance (DeFi) about access to the un- or underbanked, Ant, Google, OVO, Mynt and mPesa have done far more for financial access in emerging markets than DeFi to date.      Despite the distribution of ownership to users or early adopters, my sense is that a crypto-denominated world will bring about an even more cutthroat meritocracy than the internet-laced world we inhabit today. The early and tech savvy with Swiss bank accounts in their pocket will bounce from friendly jurisdiction to jurisdiction while left-behind nationalists rage against the status quo.      Governments will be progressively stripped of their powers of redistribution to smooth out the unequal gains of a rapidly digitizing world. The majority will find a world of tech-enabled global markets unencumbered by protectionist policies, in which they cannot compete.      The real problem with crypto is it just might work.

Speaking to Yahoo Finance's Andy Serwer on Wednesday, the billionaire investor said it was ""very likely under a certain set of circumstances"" that bitcoin would be ""outlawed"" as gold was in the 1930s.      Under the U.S. Gold Reserve Act of 1934, it became illegal for individuals to own gold because, according to Dalio, governments did not want gold to compete with money or credit as a store of value.      ""Every country treasures its monopoly on controlling the supply and demand. They don't want other monies to be operating or competing, because things can get out of control,"" Dalio added, citing India's proposed ban on crypto as an example.    Read more: Indian Government Officials Give Mixed Signals Over Planned Crypto Legislation    He added that bitcoin has ""proven itself over the last 10 years,"" having not been hacked and building a significant following.      Dalio has previously warned about the possibility of cryptocurrency bans by governments.      On other occasions, he expressed positive sentiment about bitcoin's role as a diversifier in investment portfolios.      In November, prior to BTC's staggering run-up to $50,000 and beyond, Dalio said if bitcoin or other cryptos become ""material,"" governments will ""outlaw"" it.

42386243,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSBs3,1616671792,Bitcoin Options Traders Position for Gains (to $80K?) in Historically Bullish April,"Some bitcoin options traders are betting this year's price rally, which paused in recent weeks, will resume in April – historically a strong month for the market.      Among options listed on the dominant Deribit exchange with an April 30 expiry, the most common open position is the $80,000 call, data shared by the options analytics platform Laevitas shows. Deribit is the world's largest crypto options exchange by trading volumes and open interest.      That's a sign of high price expectations for April, as noted on Twitter by on-chain analytics firm Glassnode founders Jan Happel and Jann Allemann. Bitcoin is currently changing hands around $53,000, up 83% on the year. But the market has stagnated since reaching an all-time high above $61,000 on March 13.      As highlighted by CoinDesk on Wednesday, the near-term focus in the bitcoin options market is on this Friday's March expiry, where a record $6 billion of contracts are set to come due, with some analysts warning of an extreme pullback to what's known as the ""max pain"" point, seen at $44,000.      But if that expiry comes and goes without any major price fluctuations, the bullish bets for April would come into view.      A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. Essentially, it's a bullish bet on the underlying asset.      The total open interest in the $80,000 call option is 4,469 contracts, or 240 million at press time. The option is currently drawing a premium of 0.0160 BTC on Deribit, a relatively cheap rate that reflects just how far out of the money is the $80,000 strike price.      Theoretically, the $80,000 call represents a bet that bitcoin would settle above that level on April 30. That doesn't necessarily mean buyers of the $80,000 call option are anticipating a rally above that level by the end of April.      Traders often purchase deep out-of-the-money calls even when expecting a moderate bull run because they can gain significant value as prices rise, yielding handsome returns on a small investment.      Statistically speaking, the seasonality for April is biased bullish.      Historical data shows bitcoin has chalked out gains in April in eight out of the last 10 years.

42386231,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSBgj,1616648400,"IBM Ventures Further Into Crypto Custody With METACO, Deutsche Bank Tie-Ups","IBM, known for pitching banks and blue-chip firms on private blockchain technology (the sector’s equivalent of alcohol-free beer) is taking decisive steps toward working with the hard stuff.      The 110-year-old computing giant is licensing its software to METACO, a Switzerland-based firm that specializes in custodying digital assets for financial institutions, the companies said Thursday. This is the business of safeguarding the cryptographic private keys that control a cryptocurrency wallet, the 21st-century version of protecting a vault full of gold bars.      Separately, Deutsche Bank, Europe’s eighth-largest bank, is enlisting IBM’s help to build its planned crypto custody and trading services offering, two people familiar with the arrangement told CoinDesk. The parties are close but no deal is signed yet.      These are not IBM’s first steps into crypto custody; Big Blue has been quietly making moves into digital asset safekeeping since at least early 2019. Most recently, IBM’s Cloud Hyper Protect was teaming up with Zug, Switzerland-based decentralized finance (DeFi) data oracle, DIA (Decentralised Information Asset).      IBM’s further wading into these waters speaks to a broader change in the posture of corporates toward crypto. In the late 2010s, the preferred approach for banks and other large companies was to try to shoehorn blockchain, the decentralized recordkeeping method pioneered by Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, into their processes to create more efficient databases. Like many big companies, IBM enthusiastically backed the enterprise blockchain trend, which has turned out to be a slow and relatively fruitless grind.      Read more: NY Gov. Cuomo Announces Pilot Project Using IBM’s Blockchain-Based COVID-19 App      Meanwhile, financial institutions have woken up to public blockchains and crypto assets, and that’s where the action is, the sector’s well-known volatility and manifold operational and regulatory risks notwithstanding. Banking being the biggest client industry sector at IBM, it’s the natural infrastructure choice for most banks and large financials looking for a toehold in the growing crypto asset space.      “Large enterprises are going to focus on where the rapid growth of demand is, and right now that is on decentralized finance services on public blockchains,” said Paul Brody, blockchain lead at consulting giant EY. “Firstly, transaction-centric banks want to offer crypto assets to their customers, and secondly, firms want to tokenize traditional assets, and plug them into the DeFi.”    Here come the suits    The bitcoin price rally this year has caught many market participants by surprise, leaving some native crypto firms looking to improve their infrastructure, and banks scrambling to build out digital asset strategies, according to Adrian Patten, co-founder of Cobalt, a firm that’s trying to rewire crypto to work as smoothly as institutional foreign exchange trading.      “IBM naturally sells to banks and is very well positioned,” said Patten, whose firm has also partnered with METACO around crypto custody. “A core part of providing custody is the secure management of keys. Many firms use IBM hardware for that and it’s going to be interesting to see what they do next to enhance the functionality of what’s being offered.”      Under the deal announced Thursday, METACO will protect against data breaches and cyber threats using IBM’s Cloud Hyper Protect Services and “Keep Your Own Key” (KYOK) encryption software. The solution can be offered wholly in the cloud (i.e., in IBM’s data centers), on premises (METACO clients’ servers), or in a hybrid environment, the companies said.      METACO has emerged as a go-to digital asset custody provider for banks and financial institutions, particularly in crypto-friendly Switzerland and across Europe, having provided tech to allow safekeeping of bitcoin and other virtual assets for megabanks Standard Chartered, BBVA and the Swiss-based division of Russia’s GazpromBank.

Hillery Hunter, an IBM fellow, vice president and the chief technology officer of IBM Cloud, said in a statement:    “As companies such as METACO continue to help the world’s top banks and exchanges manage their digital assets, IBM’s confidential computing capabilities help its clients ensure their data and processes are managed securely, bringing trust into the ecosystem and providing privacy assurance.”    “This integration will allow us to deliver greater levels of security and trust to our clients as they innovate in the digital asset space,” said Adrien Treccani, the CEO and founder of METACO.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/25/ibm-ventures-further-into-crypto-custody-with-metaco-deutsche-bank-tie-ups,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ed9abd77f9f427b3a455bf47f6c3cbb7488c959-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
