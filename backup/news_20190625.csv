42382203,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qtYJ,1561491909,Ex-Trump Economist Joins 'Crypto Central Bank' After Failed Fed Bid,"Stephen Moore, who recently rescinded his bid to join the Federal Reserve, announced plans to start his own cryptocurrency-based mini-Fed – billed as “the world’s decentralized central bank,” according to Fox Business.  A pitch deck sent exclusively to Fox allegedly said Moore has teamed with a group of unnamed entrepreneurs to develop a “central bank” – ironically called “Decentral” – aimed at reducing the volatility among digital currencies.  The bank will attempt to regulate the supply of crypto, just as the Fed controls monetary policy in the U.S. It will exchange its own dollar-backed token for other cryptocurrencies and use an algorithm to control the amount of stable tokens in circulation, Decentral officials told FOX. This stable coin is similar to Facebook’s Libra, and aims to promote uniformity and reliability among a fractured landscape of digital assets.  “I’m really excited about doing this,” Moore told the business media outlet. “I hope it makes me rich.”  Moore said he will officially join Decentral on July 1, as chief economic officer and report to Sam Kazemian, Decentral CEO. “These guys are super smart,” he said of his partners.  He also told Fox, he believes cryptocurrencies can circulate in the economy in such a way that they don’t conflict with the Fed's monetary policy, adding, “This is an alternative way of making payments.”  Kazemian told Fox that Decentral isn’t trying to compete with the Fed, but plans to introduce their business model to Fed officials at some point.  “Decentral will solve the biggest problem facing regulators when it comes to the crypto space: The current instability of pricing,” he said.  “Our goal is to be collaborative, not combative,” he said. “The next big wave in the crypto space is a digital currency that is designed to be useful to consumers and keep stable prices instead of acting as volatile, speculative investments. Stable coins are the next big innovation in the crypto industry.”  It’s unclear how Decentral will convince holders to trade their crypto for this new token, or how the firm will act to prevent inflation – a core mandate of Fed – if the business does not have authority to act as a central clearinghouse.  Kedar Iyer will serve as chief technology officer, Travis Moore as director of software, and Henry Liu as chief operating officer —all of whom have backgrounds in crypto and technology startups. The remaining three partners have political backgrounds.  Mike Novogratz is cited as an investor in Decentral’s parent company.  Moore previously worked as an editorial writer for the Wall Street Journal, and was a member of the conservative Heritage Foundation. He is also a distinguished visiting fellow to the White House, following his advisement on President Trump’s 2017 tax plan.  Moore was picked by Trump in March to fill one of two vacant positions at the Fed, but had not been formally nominated. He withdrew his bid in early May after weeks of criticism about his political partisanship, shifting views on interest rate policy, and sexist comments about women.  His discussions with Decentral began at recent SALT conference, a hedge fund and investing confab in early May run by Anthony Scaramucci of SkyBridge Capital.

The SEC published a rule change proposal Tuesday which would allow Wilshire Phoenix Funds to list shares of the ETF on the NYSE Arca exchange, announcing the beginning of a 21-day public comment period. The document must still be published in the Federal Register before this clock formally starts, though the regulator is already accepting input.  Wilshire Phoenix and NYSE Arca applied for the rule change proposal last month, hoping to offer shares in the United States Bitcoin and Treasury Investment Trust. The fund manager would oversee the trust, investing exclusively in bitcoin and short-term U.S. Treasury securities.  The firm tapped Coinbase's custody wing to hold the trust's bitcoin, with $200 million in theft insurance covering its holdings.  Under U.S. law, the SEC has 45 days from the filing's publication in the Federal Register to make an initial decision, though it can extend this to 90 days.

42382217,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qtkt,1561485640,Minnesota House Bill Aims to Outlaw Cryptocurrency Donations,"A group of Democratic Minnesota House Representatives have some opinions on crypto and, well, they don't want it mixing into political donations. Minnesota House Bill 2884, introduced by Rep. Rick Hansen (D), Rep. Jamie Becker-finn (D), Rep. Raymond Dehn (D), and Rep. Peter Fischer (D), wants to outlaw ""from any source a contribution or donation of any digital unit of exchange, including but not limited to bitcoin, that is not backed by a government-issued legal tender.""  Interestingly, it's not clear where stablecoins would fall here.  The full text of the Bill is below:  An individual, political committee, political fund, principal campaign committee, or party unit may not solicit or accept from any source a contribution or donation of any digital unit of exchange, including but not limited to bitcoin, that is not backed by a government-issued legal tender. An individual, political committee, political fund, principal campaign committee, or party unit that knowingly solicits or accepts any digital unit of exchange is subject to a civil penalty imposed by the board of up to $3,000. A person who knowingly accepts any digital unit of exchange in violation of this section is guilty of a felony.  As we can see, this could be a serious deterrent for a certain swathe of voter, especially since crypto is slowly entering politics. The first candidate to accept bitcoin, Andrew Hemingway, took donations in it as early as 2014 and it appears Andrew Yang is accepting crypto donations for his presidential bid. Many others are following suit.  The representatives introduced the Bill on May 14, 2019 and the House is currently in recess. We've reached out to them for further comment.

The cryptocurrency rose to €10,024 at 13:10 UTC today – a level last seen on Jan. 21, 2018 – according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, as prices refreshed 15-month highs in US dollar terms with a move above $11,400.  As of writing, BTC’s EUR-denominated exchange rate (BTC/EUR) is trading at €9,939.40, representing 2.75 percent gains on the day. On a month-to-date basis, BTC/EUR is up about 28.7 percent, while BTC/USD is flashing a 31.2 percent price rise.  Bitcoin’s underperformance in EUR terms could be associated with the fact that the 17-nation currency has strengthened 2 percent against the greenback this month. The investors have sold the greenback across the board on rising odds of an interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve.  Looking forward, BTC/EUR may continue to lag BTC/USD as interest rate futures are pricing a 100% chance the Fed will cut rates at the end of July. More importantly, markets are betting on a high probability that the US central bank will reduce rates two more times after that.  The performance differential may narrow or could flip in favor of BTC/USD in the near future if the focus shifts from the Fed to strengthening expectations of fresh monetary easing by the European Central Bank (ECB).  BTC/EUR weekly chart  Bitcoin has retraced more than 50 percent of the bear market drop and is currently 260 percent from the low of €2,780 seen in December 2018.  The cryptocurrency is looking overbought at 17-month highs, as per the above-70 reading on the 14-week relative strength index.  The price, however, is showing little signs of bullish exhaustion, with the Chaikin money flow reporting strongest buying pressure since December 2016.  The bullish outlook would be invalidated if the price invalidates bullish higher lows, higher highs pattern with a move below the May 30 high of €8,191.

42382216,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qtof,1561482006,Samourai Wallet Releases Privacy-Enhancing CoinJoin Feature,"Samourai  Wallet has unveiled a beta version of Whirlpool, a CoinJoin service that enhances transaction privacy. The company previously said that Whirlpool would be released to operate on Dojo, a much awaited bitcoin node built to work with the wallet.  This added feature disassociates crypto senders and their recipients, and makes it difficult to track the financial exchange. Samourai, a leading wallet service, is providing an easy-to-adopt layer of financial privacy for mainstream bitcoin users – and is emerging as one of the first companies to provide this technology.  CoinJoin is a process of anonymization that utilizes various privacy-enhancing software tools. First proposed by Gregory Maxwell in 2013, a “Chaumian CoinJoin” integrates Chaum blind signatures that allow the entry and exit of a transaction to be hidden by grouping and scrambling it with a collection of concurrent transactions.  The Whirlpool framework is a fully modular CoinJoin implementation that has been developed through a “heavily modified” fork of the ZeroLink theory, according to the company.  As noted in previous CoinJoin experiments, the challenge in garnering a mass of participants necessary to conduct blind transactions quickly can be difficult. It took several hours for 100 users of the privacy-centric bitcoin app Wasabi Wallet to gather and collectively execute a CoinJoin. To be sure, this transaction may have been the biggest of its kind.  Apart from the human challenge of organizing a CoinJoin, there are also built-in restrictions on the bitcoin network – such as the limit on the amount of data that can be included in a single transaction block – that limit the viability of CoinJoin. Additionally, some bitcoin enthusiasts believe that some forms of privacy and bitcoin's built-in transparency are mutually exclusive. To which Samourai has responded:  Bitcoin Magazine  also noted that CoinJoins may also increase the overall fungibility – a crucial attribute of money that ensures all units are identical – of the bitcoin network, by removing the tainted history of bitcoins previously used in illicit trades. By making bitcoin untraceable, CoinJoin diminishes the possibility of merchants refusing to accept “dirty money. This, as they say, may or may not be good for bitcoin.

The in-browser app Lolli, which allows users to earn bitcoin rewards for online purchases, just added Hotels.com to its list of partners. Now with Booking.com, Priceline, Hilton and Marriott, Lolli CEO Alex Adelman told CoinDesk travel purchases account for 40 percent of sales.  “We are leveraging our Hotels.com and Booking.com partnerships to begin international expansion in the coming months,” Adelman said about plans for the next six months. “Canada has been in high demand and we think that’s going to be a great test market for us. That will help us expand to other countries as well.”  He estimated almost half of Lolli’s “tens of thousands” of users are getting bitcoin for the first time, based on the types of user feedback his team gets. When it comes to trips costing several thousand dollars, including both flights and hotels, some Lolli users have managed to earn more than $100 worth of bitcoin rewards.  “We want that number to grow,” Adelman said of new bitcoiners. “Now we’re starting to test content for teaching people what ‘stacking stats’ means. … Hopefully, someday 90 percent of our customers will be new because we want to make the market bigger.”  Stepping back, Lolli launched in September 2018 after raising $2.35 million from Forerunner Ventures, Digital Currency Group, Square engineer Gokul Rajaram and other investors.  Speaking of Square, the company’s Cash app has its own cash-back rewards system, called Boost. But Adelman isn’t daunted by the prospect of competition. To the contrary, Lolli is starting work on its own mobile app as part of plans for international expansion. Lolli users skew younger than other cash-back-affiliate programs, which is swaying new merchants to join the company’s 900-member network and lure customers away from Amazon.  “Most international customers are on mobile, so launching mobile in the U.S. is a good way for us to prepare to go international,” Adelman said. “People who want bitcoin are young, millennial customers that merchants are interested in. there’s an opportunity for merchants to make money and that drives bitcoin adoption.”  Switzerland-based Lolli fan Stephanie Verin told CoinDesk she looks forward to the startup's international expansion, adding:  ""They managed to went away from this kinda black, gloomy and very masculine branding that a lot bitcoin related content/startups are still using...It’s the first startup I am seeing that is thinking outside the bitcoin ethos and yet is accepted by all the bitcoiners.""

42382210,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qtfr,1561475813,CFTC Approves LedgerX to Settle Futures in Real Bitcoin,"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has cleared bitcoin derivatives provider LedgerX to offer physically settled bitcoin futures contracts.  The CFTC said Tuesday it had approved LedgerX's application for a designated contract market (DCM) license, meaning the company can now offer the new futures contracts. LedgerX is the second company to receive approval to offer physically settled bitcoin futures; other firms, such as Intercontinental Exchange's Bakkt, Seed CX and ErisX plan to enter this market. (While Bakkt's own futures contracts have been self-certified, the firm is waiting for the New York Department of Financial Services to license its warehouse).  Unlike the cash-settled bitcoin futures listed by the Chicago exchanges Cboe and CME, in physically settled futures the buyer receives the underlying commodity when a contract expires, rather than the fiat equivalent.  Monday's approval means that New York-based LedgerX can not only list these bitcoin futures contracts but crucially can offer its products to retail clients, not just institutional ones.  No timeline was provided for when LedgerX might start to offer futures. but chief operating and risk officer Juthica Chou told CoinDesk that the company was looking to be the first provider of this product in the U.S.  ""There’s no doubt that we’re looking to be first, we’re looking to be the incumbent,"" she said. ""We think we’re better positioned and we want to be there to serve customers of all sizes.""  LedgerX would follow the same self-certification process that it already underwent to offer swaps and options, Chou said, adding:  ""Ultimately the products are not that economically different than what we’re already offering … but this would open up to a broader [market].""  While Bakkt has previously announced that it would be testing its own physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts in July, a firm launch date has yet to be announced. Seed CX and ErisX have likewise not yet announced when they would launch their futures products (or forwards, in Seed CX's case).  Months-long process  LedgerX applied for the DCM in November 2018 and has since been working with the CFTC. It already offers swaps and options contracts for customers.  The DCM application came on top of LedgerX's existing Swap Execution Facility (SEF) and Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO) licenses, which approve the company's exchange platform and clearinghouse, respectively.  The new license carries with it the same set of responsibilities that the other two have, Chou said, though securing the latest approval ""was a pretty difficult process"" due to the issues involved.  LedgerX is now eyeing a gradual rollout of its new products, including its retail-focused Omni platform.  ""We want to be careful and conservative so we'll soft-launch the Omni product,"" she said. ""We'll take customer feedback and we'll make sure it works.""  The company will roll out its existing swaps and options product to all customers, as well as a new block height option product which the company recently self-certified.  Chou added:  ""We have a pretty extensive waitlist and we'll work through that until we feel comfortable.""

42382221,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qtrB,1561475413,Synthetix Trader Rolls Back Broken Trades That Netted $1 Billion Profit,"In what amounts to a particularly heart-warming example of the power - and responsibilities - of decentralization, Synthetix founder Kain Warwick announced that an error that netted one legitimate user over $1 billion in profit has been fixed and that the user rolled back all the transactions in exchange for a bug bounty.  The error occurred when a commercial API began reporting wildly high prices for the Korean Won.  ""Our price oracle has a mechanism for discarding outliers and should have absorbed this discrepancy gracefully, unfortunately the price feed for KRW was only being served by two API’s at that time due to an earlier unrelated outage which had not been caught by our exception reporting,"" wrote Warwick.  From the report:  There are currently a number of trading bots actively trading on Synthetix.exchange using different strategies, one of these bots was able to detect this price error and exploit it to trade into and out of sKRW during the window where the API was incorrectly reporting the price. This resulted in several trades with profits of 1000x, resulting in over $1b in profit in less than an hour.  Luckily the bot owner understood their preposterous position and agreed to send the crypto back, a noble and/or important part of growing ecosystems like this one.  ""No funds were lost, the owner of the bot who exploited the issue agreed to reverse the trades,"" Warwick said. ""He was unaware of the issue (his bot was fully automated) until after the news broke. He reached out on Reddit once he knew and we negotiated a bounty for reversing he trades. His goal was to build a profitable bot and he wanted to make sure the profit he had made up to that point, about 30k, was safe. So we paid him a bounty for reversing the trade, since his bot was the only one that was able to exploit the oracle defect.""

42382213,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qtjd,1561474835,Wait for October: New Bitcoin Miner Demand Is Again Outstripping Supply,"Bitcoin's ongoing bull run has juiced demand for new mining equipment, putting pressure on manufacturers to produce enough machines to satiate buyers.  The world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap is currently trading at above $11,000 after it surpassed the $10,000 level over the weekend – a nearly 200 percent jump since February.  “The surge in bitcoin resulted in increased demand and supplies were already short,” said Steven Mosher, head of global sales and marketing at Canaan Creative, maker of the Avalon miner.  While he declined to disclose the firm’s order volume, Mosher said in an email that “the current state of the industry is that inventories are down and demand is high.”  He told CoinDesk:  “It looks like a return to the 2017 Q3, Q4 conditions, where demand was three times the supply.”  Back then, bitcoin’s price had doubled from July to September in 2017 and further jumped by four times in the last quarter, reaching almost $20,000.  The price increase over the past several months also led to a significant drop of the time it takes for new mining equipment to pay for itself, according to data provided by TokenInsight, a crypto startup that focuses on mining and trading research.  The firm estimates the average payback period for most mining equipment in the second quarter has dropped to 60 to 150 days, a notable decrease from the previous range of 120 to 280 days.  New models  To capture the new opportunities, Canaan launched a new mining model last month, the AvalonMiner 1041, which it claims can compute as much as 37 terahashes per second (TH/s) with electricity consumption at 2,361 watts per hour.  By comparison, an older model, the Avalon 851, performs its calculations at a speed of around 14.5Th/s, consuming 1450 watts an hour.  Mosher added that pre-orders for such models are already queued up to as late as October delivery, due to the bulk of buying interest coming from larger customers.  Similarly, crypto mining giant Bitmain rolled out for sale improved versions of its AntMiner S9 model, dubbed AntMiner S9 SE and S9k just last week. Shipment of the first batch won't be scheduled until August, according to the firm’s website.  Even more expensive and powerful products, such as the WhatsMiner M20, launched by ex-Bitmain chip design director Zuoxing Yang, are seeing an increasing level of buying interest.  Yang told CoinDesk that the next batch of M20s, which are scheduled for shipment as late as October, is ""almost sold out"" at the moment.  But Yang added another important reason why the industry's supply is having difficulty catching up with the demand is production capacity due to the limited supply of chips from various vendors to begin with.  ""Bitcoin's hash rate increase just can't keep up with the pace of the price jump,"" Yang said. ""Production capacity is the bottleneck.""  Hash rate boost  Indeed, the resurgence of mining interest is also reflected in the overall amount of computing power devoted to securing the bitcoin network, which recently hit an all-time high.  Based on data from mining pool BTC.com, the latest one day and seven-day average hash rates are at 65 million TH/s and 58 million TH/s, respectively.  This aggregated computing power has jumped by about 80 percent since late last year when the 14-day average bitcoin mining hash rate dropped to as low as 36 million TH/s amid bitcoin’s price decline.  Assuming all such additional computing power has come from more widely used mining models like the AntMiner S9 or Avalon 851 with an average hashing power of about 14 TH/s, that would translate to roughly 2 million mining units having been switched on over the past few months.  As a result, BTC.com estimates that bitcoin mining difficulty – a measure of how hard it is to solve the math problems that earn new coins – will further increase by six percent at the beginning of the next adjustment cycle to an all-time-high level above 7.8 trillion.

42382208,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qteb,1561471260,"Walmart China Teams with VeChain, PwC on Blockchain Food Safety Platform","Walmart China has launched a blockchain-based platform aimed to address food safety concerns in the country.  Announced Tuesday in a press release, the Chinese arm of the U.S. supermarket giant said it has teamed up with blockchain project VeChain, PwC and others on the initiative, which comes as the latest in a line of food tracking projects launched by the firm.  The new Walmart China Blockchain Traceability Platform already boasts 23 product lines tested and listed, VeChain said, with another 100 planned by the end of the year across 10 product categories including fresh meat, rice, mushrooms, cooking oil and more.  According to the press release, by the end of next year, the firm expects to see the fresh meat products tracked on the platform accounting for 50 percent of its total sales in that category. Further, blockchain-tracked products will account for 40 percent of total vegetables sales and 12.5 percent of seafood sales.      By scanning the products with a smartphone, Walmart China customers can access detailed information, such as the source of the tracked products and geographic location, the route the product took to the supermarket, product inspection reports and more.  Elton Yeung, strategy and innovation lead at PwC Mainland China and Hong Kong, said in the release:    ""We believe that Walmart's Blockchain Traceability System will be an excellent example of blockchain technology applied in the retail industry, helping to improve food safety and quality management, and providing a strong guarantee for building consumer trust.""        It’s notable how many different blockchain technologies Walmart is now utilizing with its various track-and-trace projects across a range of products.  The Walmart China products will be tracked via the VeChainThor blockchain, meaning the retail giant is, unusually, exploring a public blockchain.  Walmart is also a founding member with IBM of Food Trust, a permissioned platform which runs on Hyperledger Fabric, and participating in two Food and Drug Administration- approved pharmaceutical tracking pilots, the first with Mediledger using the Parity chain and a second on Fabric.  VeChain went live almost exactly a year ago today, aiming to be the first to put “real business” applications on a public blockchain. It uses a form of permissioned consensus called proof-of-authority, an alternative to mechanisms like proof-of-work mining (as used by bitcoin) or proof-of-stake.  Looking ahead, Walmart China's blockchain platform is expected to synchronize data from local government traceability platforms and suppliers' platforms.  China has notably been hit by numerous food safety scandals, from malamine-laden baby milk, to pork that glowed in the dark, to ""gutter oil"" that was recycled for human consumption.  ""VeChain will work with Walmart China to actively take heed of the call of the government, by utilizing technology to promote the traceability of fresh food, and to provide innovative solutions for the traceability platform through digital technology, so as to generate more transparent and reassuring consumption experience,"" said Kevin Feng, COO of VeChain.

42382204,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qtc5,1561464012,Swiss Central Banker 'Relaxed' About Facebook's Libra Crypto,"A Swiss central banker has suggested that Facebook's recently announced cryptocurrency project, Libra, is not ruffling any feathers with the regulator.  As reported by Reuters on Tuesday, Thomas Moser, alternate member of the governing board at the Swiss National Bank, said Facebook has indicated it is ""willing to play according to the rules"" and has been in touch with regulators over the Libra project.  As such, “I think it’s an interesting development and I’m pretty relaxed about it,” said Moser, speaking at the Crypto Valley Conference in Zug, Switzerland.  The comments will likely be welcome at Facebook, which has set up the cryptocurrency's guiding Libra Association in the country, and is also facing calls for regulatory scrutiny over the effort in other jurisdictions.  Also quoted in the Reuters report, Domenico Gammaldi, head of market and payment system oversight at Italy’s central bank, said more information is need on on the Libra project and that a mere white paper is not sufficient.  “I’ve read more than 200 pages of comments, and it’s very strange for me to give a personal opinion on 12 pages in the white paper,” Gammaldi said.  Elsewhere in recent days, France has moved to create a task force within the Group of Seven nations to examine the issues raised by Libra.  Governor of the French central bank Francois Villeroy de Galhau indicated last week that the task force would be led by European Central Bank board member Benoit Coeure and would look at how cryptocurrencies are regulated to avoid money laundering, consumer protection and other potential issues.  In the U.S., the House Financial Services Committee has announced it will host a hearing on Facebook’s cryptocurrency next month, just a day after the Senate Banking Committee holds its own hearing.  Maxine Waters, chair of the House committee called on Facebook to suspend development of the project several times last week. The hearing is scheduled for July 17, and no witness list has yet been released.  “We’ve got to protect our consumers. We just can’t allow [Facebook] to go to Switzerland with all of its associates and begin to compete with the dollar,” Waters reportedly said on Thursday.  In another article from Reuters today, the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) added to the voices calling for more information on Facebooks plans for crypto payments.  Facebook's Libra could ultimately be important in terms of public policy, said FCA CEO Andrew Bailey, therefore the company should make more information available.  Speaking to the British parliament’s Treasury Select Committee, Bailey warned:  “They are not going to walk through authorisation without that.""

42430673,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwdzh,1561460423,Bitcoin Buying Pressure Hits 2-Month High as Price Tops $11.4K,"View  Bitcoin jumped to fresh 15-month highs near $11,430 on Bitstamp earlier today, invalidating a bearish divergence on the 4-hour chart.  With a key indicator reporting the strongest buying pressure in over two months, prices appear on track to test resistances lined up at $11,688 (March 2018 high) and $11,780 (February 2018 high).  Repeated failure to hold on to gains at the crucial Fibonacci retracement level of $11,394 could yield a price pullback to the 100-hour price average, currently at $10,667.  The bullish outlook would be invalidated only if prices drop below $9,097 (May 30 high).      Bitcoin’s (BTC) price rose to fresh 15-month highs today, with a key technical indicator pointing to strongest buying pressure in over two months.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value rose to $11,430 at 10:45 UTC on Bitstamp to hit the highest level since March 6, 2018, surpassing the previous multi-month high of $11,247 seen on Sunday.  The average price across major exchanges, as seen on CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, also hit a 15-month high of $11,437 earlier today.  The rally looks set to continue toward $12,000 too, as the Chaikin money flow indicator (which shows buying and selling pressure by combining price and volume into one metric) is currently hovering at 0.32 – the highest reading since April 2.  That said, at the current price of $11,400, BTC is up 176 percent on a quarter-to-date basis and 34 percent on a month-to-date basis. Bulls usually take a breather following such stellar rallies. As a result, a sudden correction cannot be ruled out.  Any pullbacks, however, will likely be transient, as more long-term technical studies have flipped in favor of the bulls. Further, the narrative that Facebook’s fiat and bond-backed cryptocurrency Libra will end up boosting bitcoin’s appeal is becoming entrenched within the investor community.  Joe Kernen, one of the hosts of CNBC's Squawk Box, is the latest to join the bandwagon of observers calling Facebook’s Libra a net positive for bitcoin.  As can be seen above left, the Chaikin money flow index is trending north and is currently at the highest level since the beginning of April. The indicator turned positive in March, signaling a bearish-to-bullish trend change.  The relative strength index (above right) is reporting overbought conditions with an above-70 print, but is still well below the high of 86.00 seen in mid-May. Further, the overbought readings on the RSI would gain credence only if the price shows sign of bullish exhaustion, as discussed yesterday.  As of now, the bulls are showing few signs of slowing down.  4-hour chart  The ascending channel breakout seen on the 4-hour chart indicates a continuation of the rally. The RSI has breached the falling trendline, invalidating the bearish lower highs (bearish divergence) pattern.  The breakout is also backed by a surge in buy volume, as represented by the green bar (marked by arrow).  Therefore, the path of least resistance is to the higher side and prices could rise to resistances at $11,688 (March 2018 high) and $11,780 (February 2018 high).  Watch out for a repeated failure at $11,394 – 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the bear market drop – as that could yield a pullback to the hourly chart support of $10,550.

42430670,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwdvh,1561457711,"Over 2,000 Investors Back Kraken Crypto Exchange’s $13 Million Crowdfunding","Regulated spot and futures crypto exchange Kraken has completed a $13.5 million round of financing on Bnk To The Future (BF), an online investment platform.  With 2,263 participants, at press time, the campaign also represents BF’s most successful funding round by individual donors.  The exchange sought the capital as a way to push its valuation past the $4 billion mark and fund new acquisitions, according to Simon Dixon, co-founder of BF.  The firm previously acquired CryptoWatch, a US-based market data and trading platform, as well as Crypto Facilities, based in London, which provides a platform for derivatives and futures trading.  One of the busiest exchanges with more than $85 billion in trade volume in 2018 – from 4 million clients spread across nearly 200 countries – Kraken envisions itself expanding into and providing additional financial services and products for the crypto industry.  BF created a Special Purpose Vehicle for Kraken to receive equity indirectly from more than 2,200 investors – in what is known as an illiquid investment. The SPV then pools all the individual funders and acts as a single capital investor. This technique allows Kraken to bypass the SEC requirement that force it register as a public company under the 1934 Securities and Exchange Act.  These investors are therefore not shareholders of Kraken, and will only realize a return if Kraken floats its shares through an IPO, is purchased through another organization, or if the exchange undergoes a Management Buy-Out.  “This is a high risk high returns platform – please understand this before investing,” wrote BF representatives in a chatroom dedicated to the equity grab. Though speculative, Kraken noted that this was also a preferred share class with liquidation preference, which minimizes some risk.  The company’s original ask of $10.2 million was extended due to market interest after four days. The company did not reach its second goal of $15.45 million. Dixon said they are waiting for around 250 bank wires to clear for the final total. He suspects a final tabulation around $14 million.  To make an omelet you have to Kraken a few eggs  Dixon said the average investor put in around $100,000 dollars, nearly ten times the average investment from BF’s 120 previous funding rounds.  He also said that 60 percent chose to stake fiat, with the remaining 40 percent putting up some assemblage of crypto. This is another anomaly of this funding round, as BF usually sees a 70/30 split between crypto and fiat. “People may have wanted to keep hold of crypto because of rising prices,” he suggested. He also said the unusual interest in this project may be due to the perks Kraken offered.  According to an email investors received staking capital in Kraken came with ancillary benefits, including:  “CryptoWatch Premium membership, the ability to leverage shares for margin collateral, priority service from our client support team, invitation to Kraken’s exclusive investor chat room, subscription to Kraken’s Daily Hash newsletter and OTC Daily report, bi-annual Kraken investor update, beta access to new Kraken products and features, limited edition Kraken swag, [and] 5% investment rebate in KFEE.”  Despite the swag, one incredulous BF client crunched the numbers and found:  “Your $1k investment bought you about 48 future shares (from 201.612.210 in total). If Kraken is really worth $4bn in the end you own 0,00002380808% of this pie. And that's about the sum that you invested. But as you are in the ""preferred share class"" you get your investment back even if Kraken sells only for $112 million. Only if Kraken sells for more than 4bn we will make money.”  In the investment deck, Kraken noted that it is a high growth company, with a higher compound annual growth rate than traditional firms. They see most of their value coming from future cash flow potential.  The company supports trading in 24 crypto assets and 74 trading pairs, with plans of offering more. Additionally, Kraken earns margins of up to 5 percent on transactions, and up to 50 percent on futures trading, according to the company.  “Kraken is already leading in terms of delivery of must-have trader services and tools, and our product road-map is packed with new features aimed at growing our revenues and increasing market share,” a company representative wrote in the chatroom.  Release the valuation  Dixon alleged that investors had to sign a nondisclosure agreement to view a document that broke down how Kraken valued itself around $4 billion.  CoinDesk previously reported  that the company was looking to tap a small number of clients for a fundraising round, not open to the public, which would push the firm towards a $4 billion market capitalization.  Dixon also alluded to a coterminous round of private equity funding.  “The main thing is, they are allowing investors to diversify in a niche industry against a wide pool,” said Dixon. “I think it’s a great alignment of interest to take traders on their exchange and make them shareholders.”  To register for the BF platform all investors must either prove they have incomes over $200,000 for the past two years, a combined income with a partner of $300,000 over the past two years, or have a net worth of over $1 million. They must also comply with local KYC regulations.  The exchange received $1.5 million in a seed round investment in 2011, $5 million in a 2012 Series A, and $100,000 in a second Series A in 2016. Dixon also said his company staked $100,000 in an earlier funding round.  Additionally, the exchange has forged relationships with seven established bank and payments partners.  BF charges a 5 percent fee – paid up front in the share price – and can expect another 5 percent when investors cash out, a 5 percent charge on any future dividends, and a 2.5 percent fee to sell their stock on Kraken’s secondary market.

42430662,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwdlh,1561455807,"Bitcoin IRA, BitGo Launch Insured IRA Composed Entirely of Crypto","Bitcoin IRA, a digital asset IRA company, has launched the first self-directed cryptocurrency IRA.  Created through a partnership with BitGo Trust, the retirement account features $100 million in insurance protection, 30 percent lower wallet fees, and the ability for clients to diversify their holdings in 12 digital assets.  As a self-directed investment, “the authority lies with account owner, who directs us on what to hold,” said Dick Corcoran, CEO of BitGo, who left retirement to work on this partnership and product. “The rules are identical to a traditional IRA, the only difference is the asset is crypto instead of stocks, bonds, etc.”  Bitcoin IRA began offering retirement accounts in 2016, and has built more than 5,000 hybrid crypto IRAs. Since launch, the company has processed over $300 million in digital asset transactions, according to its own figures.  Bitcoin IRA registered as a Third-Party Administrator for BitGo, through its Digital IRA division to handle all administrative responsibilities including transfer applications, compliance, and transaction monitoring.  BitGo will protect these new securities by providing cold storage ""maintained in a secure, bank-quality vault offline in South Dakota,” with a clearly defined protocol on who can access the holdings, Corcoran said. Apart from physical security, Corcoran claims that the company also exceeds the regulators’ demands for the amount of capitalization and insurance behind the assets.  While he was unable to disclose those figures, but said the company acts as a fiduciary. “BitGo is a master engineer of risk and security, whether for largest institutional investor or someone beginning their retirement savings,” said Bitcoin IRA COO Chris Kline. “The whole spectrum will benefit.”  These investors are “very diverse. Not the typical archetype seen for traditional assets,” he said.  Every generation is apparently interested for different reasons, while Kline is proud of the general parity between male and female investors, as well as with the geographical spread. “We have clients in every state of the union.” “Except New York,” he adds after pausing to reflect on the requirement in the state for the so-called BitLicense.  Opening an account is instantaneous, he explained, but, because the firm “can’t automate compliance,” it may take more than a day to pass know-your-customer procedures. Additionally, funding one’s account can take as long as 10 to 15 days depending on the client’s current custodian.  Kline suggested that these new IRAs move at the speed of the internet and are a “solution raised from digital era built for digital era.”  Coin jar image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/25/bitcoin-ira-bitgo-launch-insured-ira-composed-entirely-of-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c5118987fd025b1092d7a0574a12cf87874eb8d3-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In the past, Facebook has purchased any company that threatened it, e.g. Instagram and WhatsApp. And, when it spots a company that won’t sell itself or would be difficult to purchase, it uses the “embrace, enhance and extinguish” technique.  Facebook saw Snap Inc. (maker of Snapchat) contesting a small part of its franchise, so it embraced Snap’s best features and integrated them into its app. Now, Facebook is hoping to extinguish Snap as a competitor. Compare the stock performance of Snap and Facebook, and you will probably place your bet on Facebook.  But it is not simply Facebook's business practices that are of concern.  Neither Facebook nor Google charges for their consumer products, obscuring the fact that all-encompassing consumer tracking is their real product. In many cases, their data is better than what the KGB or CIA could have gathered 20 years ago. And their data is certainly a lot cheaper, since it is voluntarily provided and easily accessible.  We would not want our government agencies to have this sort of power, nor should we want it to be in the hands of corporations.  Facebook and Google have already shown their political muscle. With their duopoly on digital marketing advertising, these companies have transformed the nature of news. Only a few news sites, such as The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, can resist their gravitational pull and still attract direct advertisers as well as subscribers.  Most other publications must use Google ads, which provide far less revenue to the outlet, slice and dice their readership, and force newspapers to write clickbait. Ads to readers are so well-placed because of the mountain of information that can be inputted into their algorithms. The same holds true for news content viewed on Facebook.  Now, with the Libra project, Facebook wants to exponentially increase its monopolistic power by accessing unparalleled information about our consumer purchasing habits. If allowed to proceed with Libra, a company that knows your every mood and virtually controls the news you see will also have access to the deepest insights into your spending patterns.  Privacy threat  Of course, Facebook will speak piously about privacy controls and its concern for the consumer, yet it will still figure out a way to sell the data or others who buy the data will figure it out for them.  Furthermore, with the richness of the social media data Facebook consistently garners, even anonymized data can be recalibrated to distill specific individual-related information and preferences. Facebook, along with its other monopolist rent-seeking cohorts, such as eBay, Uber and Mastercard, all say they won’t do that.  Quite frankly, there is zero reason to believe such promises. Their culture is based strictly on brand concerns and access to personal data. Additionally, hacks of social media are now so common that we are inured to them.  Consumers can have the benefit of a digital payment mechanism without allowing Facebook to gain more power. In the financial services sector, my institution, Signature Bank, was the first to introduce a 24/7 blockchain-enabled payment system. As one would expect, others, such as JPMorgan, are trying to follow suit and will no doubt be competitors someday.  Banks and financial institutions are limited in their access to, and transmission of, information, and for good reason. If Facebook, on the other hand, establishes Libra, no other competitor will have equal access to its data, and therefore, a chance at the consumer payment market.  In this way, Libra is in keeping with Facebook's monopolistic business style.  Further, the information monopoly Facebook would possess will be similar to what the Chinese government possesses but needs the Great Firewall to execute. Monopolistic forces will produce the same result through different means.  Call to action  Action needs to be taken quickly to stop Libra and break up Big Tech, not only for the welfare of consumers but for the good of the nation.  The first step is to force Facebook to divest or spin off Instagram, WhatsApp, Instagram and Chainspace, the blockchain startup it acqui-hired early this year.  Facebook also must be mandated to offer a parallel, ad-free, ""no collection of information"" site supported by fee-based subscriptions. Over time, this would provide some transparency as to the value of the consumer information currently being gifted to Facebook.  Google should be forced to divest or spin off YouTube, Double Click and other advertising entities, cloud services and Android. Amazon similarly needs a radical breakup as it too poses systemic threats to a transparent market. (Alexa is a prime example of the private data Amazon gathers on users’ lifestyle and personal habits.)  The breakup of these behemoths cannot wait until after the 2020 election. Such action must be taken on a bipartisan basis as soon as possible.  Even once stripped down, Facebook should remain separated from commerce due to privacy concerns. Congress, which has scheduled hearings on Libra for next month, is right to intervene.  Editor’s note: Have a reaction to the Facebook news? Email news@coindesk.com to pitch your opinion.
