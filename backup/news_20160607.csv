42426938,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxezh,1465332344,Why Russia’s CSD Believes Blockchain is a ‘Blue Ocean’ Opportunity,"Thus far, 2016 has seen no shortage of financial incumbents touting blockchain, but perhaps the most surprising has been the warm embrace the tech has received from central securities depositories (CSDs), the entities that serve as intermediaries for securities transactions.  Given the role of these businesses as often the sole arbiters of national and international markets, there has long been speculation they might be among the businesses threatened by distributed ledgers, or blockchain-enabled database environments in which the entities that are today served by CSDs are able to transact more directly.  But, movements by the the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) in the US and the National Settlement Depository (NSD) in Russia have shown a willingness to use blockchain as a tool to expand and improve CSD operations. The NSD announced in late April that it had carried out a proof-of-concept for how blockchain could be leveraged for electronic shareholder voting.  Built on the alternative blockchain platform NXT in partnership with DSX Technologies, the prototype seeks to help reduce pain points that, today, discourage shareholder participation at major meetings.  Alex Yakovlev, head of decentralized solutions at NSD, however, believes that this project only scratches the surface of what could be built with a blockchain-based system.  According to Yakovlev, blockchain opportunities currently fall into two camps: those that pursue cost reductions and “blue ocean” opportunities, and those that seek to rethink how the financial industry operates as a whole.  Perhaps surprisingly, Yakovlev said that for the NSD, its interest remains in the uncharted territory that is being carved out by cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.  Yakovlev told CoinDesk:  ""At the very beginning, we came to conclusion that blockchain cannot provide more operation excellence within existing business processes and inter-company relations without global changes. … Blockchain is about business models that cannot be supported using centralized applications paradigm.""  Yakovlev said that the NSD believes that blockchains are perhaps not best suited for replacing traditional database systems, but rather should be used by financial institutions to seek new customers, new markets and new digital assets.  Yet, he sought to position the NSD as more unique among its peers in recognizing and pursuing more experimental or novel applications.  ""Traditional financial organizations tend to think more about the first type [of use case], though many are starting to realize that blockchain could possibly allow them to navigate through the 'blue ocean', for example, by inventing new asset classes,"" he said.  Path to concept  According to company representatives, the NSD first began looking into blockchain in April of 2015, an exploration process that was further encouraged as more major financial institutions began to go public with similar tech trials.  Yakovlev said a cross-discipline working body was soon created to unite NSD’s business leaders and IT specialists into a dedicated blockchain group, a tactic that is becoming increasingly common at major financial firms.  From there, he said, five to six proofs-of-concept were proposed, with proxy voting emerging as the choice for the company’s experiments, as it “wasn’t achievable” in a centralized system, Yakovlev said.  ""The main problem with all e-voting solutions is, first of all, the voter is not able to verify his vote has not been modified before it is processed, or that votes are correctly counted. The transparency of blockchain and its distributed nature allowed us to create a voting process that provides a voter with [the] right tools to address both problems,"" he continued.  The NSD is not alone in seeking to explore this use case, as it follows an announcement in early 2016 from Nasdaq that has found it developing blockchain tech for proxy voting for its marketplace in Estonia.  Choosing NXT  Yet another factor that separates the NSD from its peers is its choice of technology.  Though it has also elected to implement a private blockchain system, it has done so using technology provided by alternative blockchain community NXT. An early standout of the crypto 2.0 community, NXT was designed as a pure proof-of-stake blockchain, though it has long faced criticisms for perceived centralization problems as they relate to the ownership makeup of its network token.  But, Yakovlev said that the specific technology was secondary to its ability to verify high transaction volumes.  He added:  “But we cannot say that NXT is a silver bullet for all use cases – there are other cases where other platforms or proprietary solutions need to be used.”  As part of its research, the NSD invited developer teams from Estonia, Israel, Russia, the US and the UK to pitch the company on how their technology could enable the use case, with DSX emerging as the winner with its NXT-based proposal.  Through the system, bondholders submit votes to parties authorized to receive those votes. Votes are then counted and submitted to the blockchain by the NSD, where they would be publicly verifiable.  Next steps  As far as further blockchain developments at the NSD, for now, the financial firm is focused on completing its voting-oriented pilot.  Yakovlev said that the NSD now will seek customer feedback to help build on the early stages of the project, with security audits and legal due diligence to follow. Still, despite the sometimes sensational headlines from the region, the NSD doesn’t believe its efforts on the latter issue will be impeded.  While certain authorities within Russia have long been pushing for a ban on cryptocurrencies, Yakovlev said that the controversy surrounding the technology was ""far from the reality"".  “It is needed to distinguish cryptocurrencies which legitimacy is still under discussion there and blockchain itself as underlying technology,” he said.  Such comments follow statements and actions from Russia's central bank that have found it taking a lead in exploring the technology. This has included forming an industry roundtable and encouraging further research into the topic, developments Yakovlev said are encouraging innovation within Russia.  He concluded:  ""Blockchain research will be invested and continued in Russia and more prototypes are to follow as a result.""

42426931,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxedh,1465327790,Stellar Co-Founder Resigns As Executive Director,"One of the co-founders of digital currency payment network Stellar has announced her resignation.  In a statement published to her personal blog, Joyce Kim said that she would be “passing on the torch” of executive director to her co-founder, Jed McCaleb, who co-founded Ripple and was the original owner of Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt Gox.  Though resigning from the executive director post, Kim said that she would continue in her capacity as chairperson of the startup's board.  In the blog post, Kim indicated that slow-moving legal changes in the financial industry and increasingly specialized product design played a role in her decision. But she added with a hint of optimism that her work abroad in micro-finance would impact her involvement with future projects.  Kim wrote:  ""I count myself lucky for this experience as there are very few times in our careers when we design products beyond the tech-included demographic. I want to take these learnings with me to other parts of our ecosystem as well.""  Looking back  Kim and McCaleb founded Stellar in 2014 with the aim of helping to facilitate low-cost transactions for users that lack access to traditional payments channels. Early on, the project positioned itself as geared toward the world's underbanked in developing regions.  As its basis, Stellar used a fork of the original Ripple consensus algorithm that was later altered following network issues.  Stellar would find itself the subject of controversy after its founding, when a lengthy report in the New York Observer offered a take on Kim's and McCaleb's exit from the Ripple project.  Stellar would ultimately be drawn into a legal dispute between Ripple and several other parties over roughly $1m in disputed funds. Earlier this year, the dispute was resolved when those funds were released to Stellar.  A new beginning  Last month, McCaleb posted a roadmap for Stellar's future, focusing on an effort to provide payments connectivity in Nigeria. The initiative involves a developer-ready platform for building apps and the establishment of partnerships with financial institutions in the African country  Kim says she plans to take the summer off to “think, read, and reflect” on her next steps during an exploratory trip that will include visits to Ecuador, Sweden and Spain. She said expects to return by the end of this summer.  Kim concluded her post:  ""I will return from my travels bursting with energy, ideas and likely a dinged up surfboard.""

42426929,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxelh,1465321027,Bloomberg Editorial Board: Public and Private Blockchains Need Level Playing Field,"The editorial board for Bloomberg News has called for a permissive regulatory environment for blockchain development, particularly in the area of public versions of the technology such as bitcoin.  In an editorial published yesterday, the board advocated for the use of so-called regulatory sandboxes, or rule-making frameworks that allow companies to test financial products within a limited scope and customer range. Comprised of a team of news and features editors, the board joins a number of countries, including the UK, that have pushed for creating such environments specifically for blockchain applications.  Comparing private and public blockchain projects, the Bloomberg editorial board posits that while public versions of the technology carry the most promise, ""current financial regulations put them at a disadvantage"".  The article goes on to state:  ""The blockchain really could change the world, making financial crises much less damaging and reducing frictions in global commerce. It could also fade into the relative obscurity of narrowly conceived technical innovation. The technology deserves to be properly explored. Regulators can make the difference by giving it some space.""  It’s a sentiment that appears to have gained traction among the world’s regulatory bodies and the central banks that oversee their respective national payment systems.  At an event  in Washington, DC earlier this month, representatives from roughly 90 central banks reportedly displayed openness about the technology, both in terms of its impact on the financial landscape as well as their own institutions.  On the other hand, some parts of the digital currency ecosystem, particularly exchanges, continue to face calls for additional scrutiny. The drive to regulate exchanges more closely has been notably seen in Europe and Asia, with Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the central bank of the Philippines, stating it would pursue such action this week.

42426933,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxeph,1465313026,French Presidential Hopeful Calls for Bitcoin Ban,"The head of a major far-right political party in France has called for ending the use of bitcoin and other digital currencies in the European country.  In a notehttp://www.frontnational.com/2016/05/les-monnaies-virtuelles-non-a-lalienation-des-citoyens-programmee-par-lue/ published last last month, Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Front and its expected candidate in the 2017 French presidential election, accused world leaders of seeking to create a world with no cash and positioned bitcoin as an effort fueled by Wall Street power brokers.  Le Pen wrote:  ""The powerful business lobby Wall Street banks (JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs) relayed by the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2016, sold two ideas to states and institutions like the EU: virtual currencies or cryptocurrencies (the best known is the bitcoin) and a cashless society.""  Le Pen went on to write that her party believes that a currency is a ""national public good, given [to] the sovereign people"", and that the digitization of money will result in broader financial monitoring by the world’s governments.  ""Therefore, in the context of the implementation of its model of economic patriotism, [the National Front] will prevent the use of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin in France,"" she wrote.  Whether the National Front, which maintains a small presence in the country’s legislature, could enact this policy goal remains to be seen.  Recent polls  suggest that the National Front could capture a significant number of votes in the presidential election, with the first round set for April of next year followed by a run-off in May among the top two candidates.  Le Pen is expected to face off against sitting French president Francois Hollande as well as Nicolas Sarkozy, the former president of France who was unseated by Hollande in 2012.

42426940,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxf5h,1465306235,UAE Telecom Giant Du Sees 'Infinite' Potential for Blockchain,"If the Technicolor lobby at Du's Dubai headquarters is a showcase of the latest and greatest in mobile tech, the registration desk for its office visitors provides a starkly different experience.  As if to illustrate the extent of the divide between progress made on technologies that create information, and those that authenticate and manage it, Du visitors are each asked to present a plastic ID so it can be filed in bright blue, wooden box. At the time of my arrival, a series of yellow sticky notes, each augmented with handwritten numbers, indicates that up to 700 IDs are being stored in the state-of-the-art system.  High above the entrance, however, the foundation for the technology that could solve this problem is in its early stages of development.  There, Jose Valles, Du’s vice president of enterprise commerce, is working to identify how blockchain could position the company to help create new applications in identity and authentication. Such a move would be an extension of Du’s current business, he argues, as the company already provides this service by assisting in the validation of bank transactions.  Together with Etisalat, Du is one of two authorized telecom providers in the UAE, earning revenues of AED 12.34bn (around $3m) from over 7 million customers. As such, Valles believes Du has the reach and customers to roll out what could one day be a wide variety of blockchain solutions.  Valles told CoinDesk:  ""The number of opportunities is infinity. Blockchain is an underlying layer that can be used for a lot of things, wherever there is a transaction.""  As a first move toward this possible future, Du has joined Dubai’s Global Blockchain Council (GBC), a more than 40-member union of regulatory bodies, financial firms and tech startups investigating the technology under the direction of the Museum of the Future, the government’s incubation arm.  In a bid to show progress, seven proof-of-concepts (PoCs) were presented by the GBC last week, however, it was Du’s announcement it would seek to determine the applicability of the technology in securing health records that has perhaps grabbed the lion’s share of the headlines.  Healthcare interest  According to Valles, Du’s investigation of the healthcare market was inspired by the Dubai government's exploration of how health records could be better secured and protected from malicious activities.  The effort is also being explored in the industry itself, and follows recent announcements from blockchain startups like Gem and healthcare providers such as Philips.  “When we saw these activities, there is a risk in terms of managing this data, having it secure. We thought we could secure all that data of health with blockchain,"" Valles said.  Valles went on to state that Du was encouraged to pick a similarly expansive topic based on what he described as the expansive aims of the GBC as a whole.  So far, other PoCs have focused on topics such as improving tourism (an effort that also involves Du) and allowing international businesses to more easily establish a presence in the country’s free zones.  For the healthcare project specifically, Du has partnered with Estonian distributed ledger startup GuardTime, a startup that recently rose to prominence in the wider distributed ledger discussion following the news it would secure 1 million health records in Estonia.  Valles said the two companies are in the process of finalizing the PoC and seeking to recruit local hospitals to join in trials of the technology.  Long-term opportunities  However, Du has a longer-term view of the technology, one that's more comparable to Valles' 35-story view of the city, complete with crystal-blue beaches, seven-star hotels and the dusty desert beyond.  Valles invoked an expansive yet distant vision for how Du could play a role in delivering new forms of identity.  ""I do believe there is a business opportunity [in blockchain], because we run the know-your-customer process. We can be an accreditation blockchain users can verify through the telephone,"" he said.  As for when the business check-in process may be easier at Du, however, he believes this future is less clear.  Valles was keen to caution that Du still has due diligence to perform on the technology, even while he revealed himself to an optimist about its potential.  ""When people started building roads, nobody thinks about the cement, they thing about the car. With blockchain, it will provide value for new businesses,"" he said, concluding:  ""Blockchain is going to enhance the lives of people.""
