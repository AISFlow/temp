42398054,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFVz7,1418168839,Blockchain Addresses Security Controversy: 'We Need to Do Better',"It has been a terrible couple of weeks for bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain.  First, the firm’s product lead got into an online spat with a Coinbase engineer on Reddit. Then, Blockchain's wallet was pulled from Bitcoin.org, an informational website managed by bitcoin core developers and community members, for poor security.  The company found itself publicly promising to reimburse customers after a random number generator flaw that led to hundreds of addresses being compromised. Further, unsubstantiated online reports suggested that bitcoins had been stolen as a result of the issue.  So, what went wrong, and what’s going to happen next?  Let’s take the most recent issue first. The firm was forced to make a security disclosure on its blog and on Reddit, admitting that a development error had led to a problem with the generation of private keys. Private keys (effectively the private addresses used to hold bitcoin) were generated with a low degree of entropy, making them easy for attackers to retrieve.  Online blowback  Blockchain offered to reimburse all customers for lost funds, but the online blowback was still huge, with commenters accusing the company of bad development work and managerial problems.  Commenters on Bitcoin Talk criticised Blockchain for several things, including letting developers push code to a production environment.  One Reddit commentator said:  “This is seriously simple stuff. Web business 101. A developer should literally not have the ability to put anything near production, because if they do they will eventually do something stupid.”  “I don’t think that’s accurate to say that this is a real criticism on Reddit,” Blockchain CEO Nicolas Cary told CoinDesk, about accusations of poor development processes.  He added:  “I think a few outspoken community members that have a lot of their own personal brand at stake are making some accusations. We’re listening to those. We know that we have to do better. We have a very strong development team.""  ""We have built a huge amount of software,"" he continued. ""We have released safely all the time, we have quality assurance leads. We have a security team. The real message to the community is that we are going to get better. We know we need to do a better job. At the same time, we have the humility to do what's right and take care of our users when there are issues.""  Core bitcoin developer Peter Todd also criticised the company for only having a manual testing repository in its GitHub repository, rather than a fully automated test suite.  Blockchain’s senior executives did not offer a formal response to Todd’s tweet. Neither did they confirm that there was an automated test suite in the company, discuss their development process or comment about the $30.5m Series A funding deal Blockchain completed in October.  Redditors had criticised the firm for failing to tighten security issues with the money. Sources close to the company privately pointed out that it takes time for a freshly funded company to use that money and make the necessary internal changes.  The Bitcoin.org delisting  All of this happened just days after the organisers of Bitcoin.org took Blockchain off the list of wallets that it provides for bitcoin users, with commenters suggesting that ""it should be revisited with reasonable criteria at least as demanding as other wallets"".  In the discussion within the GitHub pull request concerning the wallet’s listing on Bitcoin.org, site maintainer Saïvann Carignan highlighted several factors. The first was bugs and losses, of which there have been several, he said.  The second was backup and password security. ""[Blockchain] hasn't adopted security features which are slowly becoming standard in other wallets (e.g. BIP32, random passphrases, backup on setup, rotating addresses, 2FA by default),” he said.  He also criticised the company for not being transparent enough, and not resetting the app’s source code, adding:  “To be fair, each of these issues would have blocked or delayed listing Blockchain if the wallet was submitted today. Accordingly, I think the logical next step to incentivize security and reduce risks for the user is to raise the bar for Blockchain like other wallets”.  Ben Reeves, Blockchain’s CTO, posted a response in that GitHub discussion addressing the complaints and promising several changes. This was praised by the other participants, on the basis that the initial criticisms concerned the track record of the Blockchain service. So, the consensus remained to delist the wallet for at least 60 days, and to let Blockchain resubmit it after that.  Carignan acknowledged complaints that there was no set policy for listing or delisting wallets from Bitcoin.org, and opened another discussion to develop a standard process.  ""We are eager to resubmit there. We respect their decision, but ultimately we have made a lengthy defense for our position. We are still the only open-source company,"" said Cary, who added that the company is making changes to its software, and that people should expect ""exciting things coming to market in 2015"".  A wider FinTech problem  Blockchain has made its mistakes, but Emin Gün Sirer, an associate professor of computer science at Cornell University and an expert in bitcoin security issues, warned against a witch hunt.  He said:  ""To their credit they have realised that their processes were broken when they made some personnel changes internally to bring different people in charge of security. I have had private conversations with them and it sounds like this is a bunch of people trying very hard to patch the flaws as they appear.""  These security issues are a sign of a wider problem in the cryptocurrency space, warned Sirer.  ""There is no room for the smallest screwup, and we’re finding out that standard practices that are normal in Silicon Valley are unacceptable in the bitcoin world because there’s so much at stake,"" he said, arguing that the rate of security failures is high across the bitcoin industry.  Online spat  Cary also called the timing for this whole affair ""suboptimal"". That seems accurate, given an online spat that broke out between Coinbase and Blockchain executives earlier this month over bitcoin wallet security, in which Blockchain staff criticised Coinbase’s operating model.  It all started with a Reddit post by Charlie Lee, the creator of litecoin, who took a job at Coinbase 18 months ago. Lee, now engineer manager at the company, wanted to set the record straight about security at the centralised wallet service.  Lee described what the service has done for the security of its users. Among those he listed were default requests for two-factor authentication (using something you have, such as a phone, in addition to something you know, like a password) if making transactions above $100. The service also included a bitcoin vault for its users, and stores 97% of its own coins in cold storage, said Lee (CoinDesk has covered some of Coinbase’s security before).  All this information is part of the public record. The interesting part came in one part of Lee’s post, in which he compared CoinBase’s security to that of Blockchain. One part of the post (later removed) read:  “Over the past year though, Coinbase kept introducing new security features while Blockchain wallet's security has stayed exactly the same, and arguably became worse.”  This led to an angry riposte by Keonne Rodriguez, product lead at Blockchain, who criticised Lee for chasing his own agenda, and likened him to “a shady lawyer chasing an ambulance”.  A serious approach  Name calling and criticising doesn’t help anyone, suggested Michael Perklin president of Bitcoinsultants, and a specialist in bitcoin security. Perklin, also a director at the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, has a background in security within other industries.  “I enjoy accurate discussions based on the merits of the argument,” concluded Perklin. “But whenever anyone throws mud at someone else, they have to get themselves dirty first.“  Those comments all occurred before Blockchain’s latest security debacle. What does Cary have to say about it now? He is still eager to draw distinctions between the two models.  Cary said:  “We have a lot of respect for what Coinbase are doing. We’re not here to start a mud-throwing contest with anyone. We want to have a company that basically has a long-term vision for the success of bitcoin, and takes consumer protection very seriously, and takes care of consumers where there are problems, but also continues to take a non-custodial approach to managing risk.”  Cary said that the company was eager to actively engage and listen. “We take all of these things super-seriously. We are here for the long term,” he concluded.

42398061,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFW60,1418160982,SecondMarket: Syndicate Bidders Real Winners of Bitcoin Auction,"The US Marshals Service (USMS) confirmed today that a bidding syndicate organised by Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) and the trading division of SecondMarket took 48,000 BTC in its second bitcoin auction.  The 48,000 BTC (worth roughly $16.9m at press time) is the largest ever won in a USMS bitcoin auction, trumping the nearly 30,000 BTC won by venture capitalist Tim Draper this June. In total, SecondMarket and BIT secured 19 of the 20 bitcoin blocks put up for bid, while the remaining block was claimed by Draper.  Speaking to CoinDesk, SecondMarket managing director Brendan O’Connor expressed his excitement about the news given the work that went in to assembling the 104-person syndicate.  O'Connor said:  “When you put a lot of effort into something like this you want to win, you want to be able to bear some fruit and show some results. For all the folks internally that spent a lot of time and effort on this it was a very good conclusion.”  SecondMarket itself was not a bidder in its own syndicate, however, he confirmed, meaning none of the 48,000 BTC will be used by the illiquid asset exchange or as part of BIT, its open-ended bitcoin-only trust.  “The bitcoin was won by the participants in the syndicate,"" O'Connor said. ""We were not purchasing any of it.”  The auction winners were notified of the outcome on 5th December. SecondMarket came forward with its announcement earlier today, having distributed all of the 48,000 BTC to the winners in the syndicate over the weekend, O’Connor said.  SecondMarket declined to comment on the price of the takings or the members of the syndicate.  Access to interested bidders  Although SecondMarket won't hold any of the winning bitcoin, O’Connor said the firm’s interest in participating was motivated by the need to provide an outlet for others to participate but skip the tiresome authorization process.  “[It was] for folks out there that wanted to participate in having a chance to win some fairly large blocks of bitcoin that do not come to the market all that frequently without having to go through the trouble of actually going through the approval process with the USMS,” he said.  The syndicate model opened the USMS auction to a wider range of foreign and domestic investors, as well as smaller investors who wanted to bid but could not meet the required $100,000 minimum deposit necessary.  ""You have to kind of pass muster from a variety of different perspectives and it requires a lot of time and effort to become an approved bidder in the auction,"" O'Connor said.  SecondMarket received 104 bids and the BTC quantity bid was 124,127, adding that it was “basically two and a half times the subscription”.  US holiday distractions  When asked about the decline in registered bidders between this auction and the previous one held in July, O’Connor surmised the Thanksgiving holiday in the US might have played a part.  “I’m not 100% sure why they continue to target major holiday times,” he said. “Last time they did this was around the 4th of July and this time it was around Thanksgiving, so its tough to really say.”  A USMS spokesperson has claimed that the timing of the auctions is planned to avoid market disruption. Nevertheless O’Connor said the drop in auction participation is no indication of more bearish attitudes, as bidders needed to place competitive bids to edge out the competition.  He concluded:  “I think you had a lot of very serious folks come to the table that had a strong interest in participating and are very bullish on bitcoin in general. That I think is a very serious statement to say.”  Image via SecondMarket",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/12/09/secondmarket-syndicate-bidders-real-winners-of-bitcoin-auction,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f9bb40320429b7c001335420d9d0057708ac6315-1500x1144.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398045,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFVpH,1418156775,Stellar Network Fork Prompts Concerns Over Ripple Consensus Protocol,"A recent unintended ledger fork in the Stellar network led to a temporary disruption of its transaction system and a broader debate about the integrity of the Ripple consensus protocol.  The debate began on 5th December, when Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) executive director Joyce Kim published a blog post outlining a fork in the Stellar network that the company attributed to problems within the Ripple consensus protocol.  Both Ripple Labs and Stellar use the open-source protocol to provide competing transaction networks that allow fiat money to be sent over the blockchain. The development calls into question the viability of technology both companies hope will appeal to individuals and businesses seeking a powerful way to reduce the costs of moving money, though the incident last week only impacted the Stellar network.  A core question that resulted was whether Stellar’s network problems are possible in Ripple’s as well, or whether the issues arose from changes in the consensus protocol code. Stellar itself is a modified fork of Ripple, an initiative led by Jed McCaleb following his exit in 2013 from Ripple Labs, which he co-founded.  Unsurprisingly given the history of disputes between the organisations, Ripple Labs has contested the Stellar team’s conclusions in a response blog post penned by Ripple Labs chief technology officer Stefan Thomas. Thomas argued that the problems lie in Stellar's changes to the consensus protocol prior to implementation and said that the Ripple network has not experienced these problems in the past.  New protocol needed?  According to Stellar’s initial report, network nodes failed to agree on a common ledger, essentially creating twin transaction histories that the development team later corrected over a period of several hours. This process resulted in the loss of customer funds on at least one exchange that offers a marketplace for Stellar’s token asset, stellars, and the deletion of transactions that were included on the eventually altered chain.  McCaleb, who also founded now-defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, later released a technical assessment that pointed to a persistent stability issue within the stellar network.  McCaleb wrote:  “We've seen the nodes exhibit a tendency to get out of sync since at least September. The network would split three or four ways and then eventually come back together, but it would do so relatively quickly and without loss. Last week’s fork was a case of this happening but the ledger was not able to come together quickly.”  He reiterated that the Ripple consensus protocol is to blame, pointing to a flaw by which nodes verify transactions based on data from a smaller pool of nodes than originally intended. McCaleb added that the Stellar team is working to “make the code safe”.  As a result of the incident, the SDF will redouble efforts on a replacement consensus protocol being led by David Mazières of Stanford University’s Secure Computing Group.  In the meantime, the Stellar transaction network will run on a single verifying node in order to avoid similar problems while the new protocol is being developed.  Criticism focuses on protocol safety  The consensus protocol forms the basis for how transactions are verified in both the Stellar and Ripple networks, with participating nodes agreeing on rounds of transactions that are then hard-coded into the respective ledgers of those networks.  In Stellar’s initial post on the fork, Kim stated that the Ripple protocol has two primary issues: the minimization of transaction safety in favor of system activity and node integrity, and that the ability of the consensus algorithm to achieve correctness.  Kim wrote:  “The existing Ripple/Stellar consensus algorithm is implemented in a way that favors fault tolerance and termination over safety. This means it prioritizes ledger closes and availability over everyone actually agreeing on what the ledger is—thus opening up several potential risk scenarios.”  Kim added that research conducted by Mazières “reached the conclusion that the existing algorithm was unlikely to be safe under all circumstances"". A new white paper featuring the proposed consensus protocol, as well as its code are expected to be released in the next few months, she continued.  Ripple responds  Ripple Labs CTO Thomas wrote in the company’s rebuttal that some of the assertions in Stellar's blog posts were misleading or incorrect, citing its white paper as sufficient proof that its consensus protocol is secure.  He wrote:  ""We have not reviewed Stellar’s modified version of Ripple consensus, but as far as the Ripple consensus algorithm is concerned, the protocol provides safety and fault tolerance assuming the validators are configured correctly.""  Thomas also disputed the mechanism by which nodes in the network reach consensus on transaction rounds, and said that the Ripple team looks forward to reviewing the findings prepared by Mazières.  Ripple chief cryptographer David Schwartz later told CoinDesk in a statement that systems like the Ripple consensus protocol “only work reliably when a sufficiently large percentage of validators or miners are working properly"".  “Based on the information available, we suspect a large percentage of Stellar's validators failed, which caused the ledger fork,” he said.

42398052,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFVx9,1418140554,"Bitcoin Investment Trust Syndicate Wins 48,000 BTC in US Marshals Auction","A bidding syndicate organized by Bitcoin Investment Trust and the trading division at SecondMarket has been revealed as the winner of nearly all of the 50,000 BTC auctioned by the US Marshals Service (USMS) last Thursday.  The syndicate won 19 of the 20 blocks put up for auction by the USMS, or a total of 48,000 BTC (worth roughly $16.6m at press time). The 50,000 BTC confiscated from alleged Silk Road leader Ross Ulbricht and sold were divided into 10 blocks of 2,000 BTC and 10 blocks of 3,000 BTC.  Bitcoin Investment Trust announced the news on Twitter, while the USMS separately confirmed the announcement in an email.  ""The U.S. Marshals Service is confirming that the recent bitcoin auction resulted in two winning bidders. One bidder won 19 blocks, totaling 48,000 bitcoins, and the other won one block of 2,000 bitcoins. Because SecondMarket has voluntarily come forward, we can confirm that it was the winner of 48,000 bitcoins, and the transfer of those bitcoins was completed Monday.""  Brendan O’Connor, managing director at SecondMarket, told CoinDesk that he was pleased with the results the syndicate was able to provide its participants.  ""We're very excited that the work that we put in in terms of organising the syndicate was able to bear some fruit this time around,"" he said.  Draper Fisher Jurvetson managing director and avid bitcoin enthusiast Tim Draper was revealed as the winner of a smaller block of 2,000 BTC (worth roughly $750,000 at press time) last Friday. Draper purchased 29,656 BTC seized from the now-defunct online black market Silk Road in June, announcing at the time that the bitcoins would be used to help bitcoin exchange Mirror (formerly Vaurum) serve more global consumers.  Event partication  The auction was held over a six-hour period beginning at 8:00am EST and ending at 2:00pm EST. The USMS announced last week that just 11 registered bidders participated in the auction, down from the 45 observed during its first bitcoin auction in June.  Though overall bidder registration was down, participation in bidding syndicates appears to have increased. SecondMarket chairman Barry Silbert took to Twitter to reveal that 104 bidders participated in the auction group led by Bitcoin Investment Trust and SecondMarket, a figure that was up from 42 in June.  As a result, the 48,000 BTC will be divided among the 104 participants in the syndicate.  ""The bitcoin were won by folks who participated in the syndicate, so we don't know what the plans are for the bitcoin,"" O'Connor added.  Bitcoin Investment Trust is the private, open-ended trust invested exclusively in bitcoin and helmed by investor and bitcoin enthusiast Barry Silbert, while SecondMarket provides an illiquid asset exchange marketplace.

42398047,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFVsE,1418130174,"6,000 Merchants in Romania Can Now 'Opt In' for Bitcoin Payments","UPDATE (16th December 17:45 GMT): Netopia's partner exchange BTCXchange.ro has announced that it is suspending operations due to security issues. It is asking all users to withdraw all funds in fiat and BTC by 19th of December. CoinDesk has reached out to Netopia for comment and will update the article upon receiving additional information.      One of the biggest online payment processors in Romania is integrating a bitcoin option into its services for merchants.  Netopia mobilPay  said the move would provide more than 6,000 partner retailers with the ability to process bitcoin payments, with no additional development costs.  To make the integration possible, the company has partnered with Romanian bitcoin exchange BTCXChange and Dutch-Romanian company ​Coinzone.com.  Antonio Eram, Netopia mobilPay's CEO and founder, told CoinDesk:  ""We see a great future for bitcoins, however, we cannot estimate the impact on the market. There are a lot of things to take in consideration. We are setting the foundations, and future will tell us if we are right (or not). ""  He explained that the company will set ""very low"" percentage fees per transaction and is working on simplifying the acceptance model to enable faster adoption.  ""Bitcoin transactions will certainly see growth in the next six months and we are probably looking at something up to €100,000 in the first months,"" Eram said.  The company – which specialises in small transactions in the €0.50 to €20.00 range – is currently processing around 50% of all mobile payments in Romania, according to the CEO, and offers a range of services, such as payments by SMS or telephone, and credit card payments.  Growing the bitcoin ecosystem  The company's goal for cryptocurrencies, Eram continued, is to create an environment in which bitcoin is widely accepted, creating an ecosystem based on blockchain technology.  Eram explained:  ""We have opened bitcoin processing and made it available to all our 6,000-plus merchants (online and offline). Bitcoin implementation is an opt-in service. This is due to Romanian and EU regulation, and is basically done by checking 'I want to accept bitcoin' within our payment gateway.""  Romania has vibrant bitcoin community, he added, with bitcoin ATMs, point-of-sale (POS) services that accept and sell bitcoins, along with at least one operational exchange.  ""You can buy bitcoin at more than 2,000 ZebraPay and Qiwi Kiosk terminals throughout the country. I don’t think that there is any country where it is easier to get bitcoin. You can literally buy them on every corner,"" said Eram.  The company has also launched a mobile wallet in Romania, in partnership with MasterCard. While the company is considering integrating bitcoin into the wallet, Eram admits this is ""a bit of a stretch"".  Netopia mobilPay was incorporated in 2003 and currently has offices in Bucharest, Romania, and Sunnyvale, California. It is active in Romania and Mexico with several payments-related services.

42398048,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFVuC,1418125627,Yacuna Exchange Introduces Instant GBP Deposits for UK Customers,"International cryptocurrency exchange Yacuna has announced the launch of a new service that will enable UK customers to complete instant pound sterling (GBP) deposits to buy bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin.  The news will likely come as a relief for UK exchange users who are currently largely limited to using slow Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) payments for deposits at most exchanges. This sometimes frustrating hurdle comes about due to the difficulty experienced by Britain's bitcoin companies in finding banks that will work with them.  London-based Yacuna, which launched in September of this year, described the new funding feature as an important step for its international expansion, one that will ease the purchasing ability of customers in its home market.  Yacuna executive director Mark Caruso further emphasized this point, stating:  ""The UK is a vital market for every major bitcoin exchange.""  'Lightning fast' payments  Instant processing for the new service will be handled by SOFORT Bankinghttps://www.sofort.com/eng-GB/buyer/sb/how-sofort-banking-works/, another factor the company touted as a benefit of its service over the competition's.  ""SOFORT Banking makes deposits lightning fast,"" said Yacuna VP of marketing and communications Mike Schnoor. ""Therefore, we're using SOFORT Banking for high-speed transactions to ensure a customer finds the deposits as soon as possible in their Yacuna account.""  He pointed out that the UK Faster Payments System, while free of charge, takes a few hours until money is moved.  ""With SOFORT Banking, we are able to process deposits within seconds and it works the exact same way as a UK online wire transfer,"" explained Schnoor.  Withdrawals to bank accounts cost 3.00 GBP, while the fee for SOFORT deposits is 4.90%.  Yacuna said it plans to introduce more convenient deposit methods in the future, covering more markets and supporting more national currencies.  Last month, Yacuna launched a 'no-verification' bitcoin buying service designed specifically for new bitcoin buyers. Dubbed YacunaDirect, the user-friendly service is an attempt for the growing exchange to appeal to a wider, international audience.  Emphasizing the UK market  The announcement by Yacuna is notable given the number of more well-known bitcoin exchanges that have moved to serve the UK market in recent months.  For example, Kraken added GBP trading in late October, while its UK-based competitor Coinfloor has recently increased the number of currencies it accepts to include US dollars and euros in addition to GBP.  ""Digital money is widely accepted among customers and the market coverage is constantly growing. We are happy to finally provide our UK customers with the easy and convenient access to instant bank deposits in GBP on our exchange. All you really need is your banking account,"" said Caruso.  Yacuna launched instant euro deposits in seven European countries earlier this month. That service is currently available to Yacuna users in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland and Switzerland.  British banks and bitcoin  To the consternation of the UK's bitcoin startups, British banks have been reluctant to deal with firms in the cryptocurrency space. Their cautious approach has caused a number of issues for UK-based bitcoin companies, as well as a number of companies based in British Crown Dependencies such as the Isle of Man.  However, earlier this month the UK Digital Currency Association (UKDCA) responded to a call for information on digital currency issued by the UK Treasury. In its filing, the association called on the Treasury to intervene on behalf of digital currency firms and make banks more willing to establish relationships with the cryptocurrency sector.  The UKDCA warned that failure to do so will result in capital flight, as digital currency businesses will simply set up shop somewhere else if British banks keep refusing to do business with them.

42398051,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFVwA,1418109447,New York State Tax Agency: Bitcoin Buyers Don’t Need to Pay Sales Tax,"The New York State Department of Taxation and Finance has said that bitcoin purchases will not be subject to sales taxes.  According to a tax guidance memorandum from the agency’s Taxpayer Guidance Division dated 5th December (hat tip Marco Santori), digital currencies are a type of “intangible property” and, as such, are not subject to a sales tax when purchased.  The move comes months after the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released its initial guidance on taxing bitcoin as a type of property, and provides an answer to a long-brewing question about how state sales taxes in the US may be applied to bitcoin transactions.  Only in certain cases  The document states that a sales exchange involving a digital currency would be considered a type of barter transaction. Under this definition, the agency writes, only certain goods and services exchanged for a digital currency would be subject to a sales tax or related reporting requirements.  The memorandum includes several examples outlining how one party may, or may not, be required to pay and report sales taxes when a digital currency is involved, stating:  “...if the party that gives convertible virtual currency in trade receives in exchange goods or services that are subject to sales tax, that party owes sales tax based on the market value of the convertible virtual currency at the time of the transaction, converted to US dollars. If the party that trades property or services in exchange for receiving convertible virtual currency gives the other party a sales slip, invoice, or receipt, the first party must separately state the sales tax due in US dollars on the sales slip, invoice, or receipt.”  The Taxpayer Guidance Division also clarifies that its treatment of corporate and personal income taxes related to digital currency “conforms to the federal treatment of convertible virtual currency”, referring to past guidance published by the IRS.  Tax a 'systemic risk' to digital currency  Santori, global policy counsel at Blockchain and attorney at law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, told CoinDesk one of the greatest systemic risks to digital currency adoption has always been that its purchase be subject to sales taxation by governments.  ""This guidance is the first official statement we have on the matter, and it is excellent news. Because the guidance could serve as a model for other jurisdictions around the world, it is difficult to overstate its importance.""  The issue has reared its head in other international jurisdictions as well. While the UK has chosen not to levy its Value Added Tax (VAT) on digital currency exchanges, others, such as Singapore, would apply the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in some circumstances.  This has led to fears of double-taxation as users are charged tax once to acquire bitcoins, and then again when using it for purchases. The European Union is still considering the question.  A more concerning case is Australia, whose tax authority has implied a 10% GST would apply to all digital currency acquisitions. Groups within the country are currently lobbying the federal government to intervene and change the law in an effort to nurture startup activity.
