42376238,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwL5af,1622479422,Voting on a Proposal to Reimburse Mt. Gox Victims Begins Today,"The trustee presiding over the Mt. Gox civil rehabilitation case has taken the next step toward partially reimbursing victims who lost money to the cryptocurrency exchange in hacks that date back nearly a decade. As of today, claimants can begin to vote on whether or not they will accept the civil rehabilitation proposal.  The deadline for claimants to cast their vote online is Oct. 8.  Significantly, the notice from the trustee states:  ""If you do not vote, you will be deemed to have voted against the Draft Rehabilitation Plan for the requirement of the amount of the voting rights.""  Because a minimum threshold of 50% of votes is required in order for the proposal to pass, there is a chance the proposal could fail even if the majority of votes actively cast vote in favor of acceptance.  How the payouts could work  According to a letter sent to claimants last year, the proposed payout would reimburse creditors in both JPY and BTC or BCH. The total value of each claim is denominated in Japanese yen (JPY) with each bitcoin being pegged to nearly $7,000, the rough price of bitcoin when the civil rehabilitation began in 2018 (not the $37,000 price of today, but also not the few hundreds of dollars bitcoin was trading at when Mt. Gox fell).  Mt. Gox was hacked recurrently from 2012-2014, eventually driving it into insolvency. Since 2014, bankruptcy proceedings have evolved into these rehabilitation proceedings. The drawn-out drama means some exhausted creditors sold their claims to law firms, individuals and other stakeholders in the case.  According to the terms of the proposal, if a claimant filed a fiat bankruptcy claim back in the day, they would be entitled to a priority payment for the full sum lost plus damages.  For everyone else, there are a few options.  First, all approved creditors will receive a base payment of up to 200,000 JPY (approximately $1,800 USD) that will count toward their total claim.  From there, they can choose between two options: They can opt for a faster, early-sum payment which will reimburse them for about 21% of their first claim. Or, they can also choose to wait for what could be potentially a few more percentage points, but this isn’t guaranteed.  In other words, someone who lost 1 BTC and $1,000 who selects the “Early Sum” payment would receive a base (small sum) payment of 200,000 JPY ($1,826.43 USD), along with 0.13194012 BTC, 0.13302035 BCH and 247,396 JPY, for an approximate value of nearly $10,000 USD.  Should that same person select the later “Final” payment options, they could see that amount go up to around $11,000 USD. But it could also dip lower than the Early Sum amount of $10,000.  There is no guarantee that the price will go up (or down) because Mt. Gox currently holds over 141,000 BTC and 141,000 BCH and some 68 billion JPY of fiat, but they have a total of 680,000 BTC/BCH and 8.8 billion JPY in approved claims (and 130,000 BTC/BCH and 50 billion JPY), per a WizSec blog post which explains payout details. There are also some claims awaiting approval; so, at this point, there is no way of knowing exactly what the final total disbursement amount to all creditors will be.  Also up for clarification is how those funds will be denominated. Creditors who lost funds in fiat currencies will be paid in JPY. Any cryptocurrency amounts owing will be reimbursed in a mix of BTC and/or BCH and JPY.  WizSec estimates that 30% of the dollar amount for BTC/BCH claims will likely have to settle in JPY due to the shortage of cryptocurrency funds recovered and the numerous exchanges for fiat that have been conducted over the years. Any disbursement in cryptocurrencies will be sent to exchanges included on a whitelist approved by the trustee.  Creditors can get an estimate of their potential payout, should the proposal pass the vote, by using the payout calculator on WizSec’s latest post regarding the rehabilitation proceedings.  Voting for an end to the drama  Should the proposal be accepted by the majority of stakeholders, individuals can then decide which of the two options (early or final settlements) they will choose for themselves.  Should the vote fail, it will be back to the drawing board for the trustee and the board, leaving creditors waiting for a new proposal to be drawn up. Considering the years it has taken for this proposal to be created, failure to accept these terms would likely force creditors to wait even longer for any compensation.  These recovery efforts by the Mt. Gox trustee, despite some media claims, are separate from a class action lawsuit levied against Mark Karpeles, the owner and operator of Mt. Gox at the time it went bust. Karpeles has suggested that creditors should accept the trustee’s proposal rather than pursue him in the separate class action proceedings; however, he is not directly involved in the proposal negotiations.",POSITIVE,BCH | BTC,BCH | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/05/31/voting-on-a-proposal-to-reimburse-mt-gox-victims-begins-today,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bfbaeca26000b6ef47a2806dd9c49ed8ef53e7ee-1500x1006.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The HRF's Bitcoin Development Fund latest round will allot $210,000 to Bitcoin developers, two Lightning Network wallet teams, and an Arabic translator. In this round, Bitcoin Core contributors Calvin Kim, Dhruv Mehta and Abubakar Nur Kahlil will each receive $50,000; the Breez and Sphinx wallet teams will pick up $25,000 each; and English-Arabic translator Arabic_HODL will receive $10,000.    Read more: This Scaling Tech Could Let You Sync Bitcoin Straight From Your Phone    Kim will use the funding to work on Utreexo, a Bitcoin node scaling project which takes Bitcoin's transaction history and represents it in under a kilobyte of data, reducing the time and effort it takes to bootstrap the node software that is the backbone of Bitcoin's network. Mehta will continue his work on Bitcoin's security with Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 324 to reduce Sybil attack vectors on Bitcoin nodes. Kahlil will be working on a wallet purpose-built for his home country of Nigeria, a land where bitcoin adoption is thriving in response to political corruption and capital controls.      Sphinx Chat, a Lightning Network wallet and encrypted messaging service that allows its users to chat using the Lightning Network, will use its grant to build out a directory to connect their users with activists for humanitarian funding. Breez, another Lightning Network wallet, will use its money to build out its own encrypted chatting capabilities, as well as to improve node backup support and add Tor support for Android and iOS. Arabic _HODL will continue to translate Bitcoin content into Arabic.    Bitcoin development grants continue one year on    Jaewoo Cho, an assistant professor at Hansung University, and an anonymous cryptocurrency investor, RenoHQ, led the donations for this round, which also included funding from Anthony Pompliano's Bitcoin Pizza Day sales and Cygni Capital.

With recipients from Korea, Nigeria, the Middle East and elsewhere, this is perhaps the HRF's most diverse and globe-spanning round to date. The organization began issuing grants to Bitcoin developers, journalists and other community members last year, and it has issued over $800,000 in bitcoin (at today's exchange rate) for 18 recipients and projects since launching last May.      Square Crypto, BitMEX, Kraken, Gemini and other Bitcoin and crypto companies have also donated heavily to Bitcoin developers and other community members in the past year.

""It has come to our attention through media reports that certain banks/regulated entities have cautioned their customers against dealing in virtual currencies by making a reference to the RBI circular dated April 06, 2018,"" the RBI said in a circular released Monday. ""Such references to the above circular by banks/regulated entities are not in order as this circular was set aside by the Hon’ble Supreme Court on March 4, 2020.""      ""As such, in view of the order of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the circular is no longer valid from the date of the Supreme Court judgement, and therefore cannot be cited or quoted from,"" the statement added.      The RBI's clarification comes amid reports that country's top lenders – State Bank of India and HDFC Bank – are sending reports to certain clients, inquiring about their virtual currency transactions and warning of cancellation or suspension of their cards, citing RBI's 2018 circular, which prohibited lenders from serving crypto exchanges,      However, the Supreme Court quashed the banking ban in March 2020, bringing cheer to Indian investors and local exchanges. Even so, in recent weeks, several private lenders have shut down payment gateways to merchants involved in cryptocurrency dealings, causing disruption at local exchanges.      Also read: India’s HDFC Bank Calls Bitcoin a Fad as Exchanges Mull Legal Fight Over Restrictions      The RBI's latest statement only makes clear that the central bank hasn't asked lenders to stop providing services to exchanges. It doesn't explicitly ask banks to restore services to crypto exchanges and says lenders should ensure necessary compliance.      ""Banks, as well as other entities addressed above, may, however, continue to carry out customer due diligence processes in line with regulations governing standards for Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Combating of Financing of Terrorism (CFT) and obligations of regulated entities under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, (PMLA), 2002 in addition to ensuring compliance with relevant provisions under Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) for overseas remittances,"" the circular said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/31/rbi-says-banks-cant-quote-2018-circular-to-restrict-crypto-transactions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd27429d75ee2817b68073aec956ce8720804db7-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As reported by The Times of Israel on Monday, the lawsuit filed May 25 claims token sales from Sirin Labs, Stx Technologies Limited (Stox) and Leadcoin had raised $250 million in total from investors, but the companies didn't develop products as investors had been promised.  Instead, the allegation from former employees of Hogeg-owned entities is that the funds were appropriated for personal use.  Hogeg and other defendants didn't respond to a Times of Israel request for comment. Hogeg, who owns 70% of Singulariteam, denied the allegations in another report, the online newspaper said.  Roee Brocial and Eran Okashi brought the $1.6 million lawsuit against Moshe Hogeg, Adi Sheleg, Ido Sadeh Man, Yaron Shalem, Shmuel Asher Grizim, Avishai Ziv, Singulariteam Holding II and Singulariteam Ltd.  The plaintiffs, employees of Sirin Labs and Singulariteam, respectively, are said to be on unpaid leave.  They claim they were fooled into investing their own money in the ICOs and encouraged friends and family to do the same, suffering financial harm and psychological trauma as a result, according to the report.  The owner of the Beitar Jerusalem soccer team, Hogeg has been hit by a number of lawsuits, including one for over $5.9 million in allegedly unpaid factory bills for the Sirin blockchain phone.

According to a Bloomberg report published Monday, activity on OTC desks has picked up since the Communist Party reiterated its long-held ban on crypto services on May 18.      The initial response to the China news was panic selling, with bitcoin hitting a low of $30,000 the following day. Sentiment has since recovered, as evidenced by the bounce in the yuan-stablecoin tether (CNY/USDT) exchange rate.      According crypto data platform Feixiaohao, the rate has recouped almost half the 5% drop seen during the knee-jerk price slide. Panic selling usually boosts demand for the stablecoin tether, driving CNY/USDT lower.      The recovery signals the worst of the sell-off may be over and points to a rise in yuan-denominated trades, which are mostly booked via domestic OTC desks powered by Huobi and OKEx.      These trades happen in two stages, as Bloomberg noted. The first involves matching orders on OTC desks, and the second involves payment of yuan to the seller through a different platform or a fintech company like Ant Group.      Also read: China Reiterates Crypto Bans From 2013 and 2017      As a result, authorities struggle to monitor the transactions. However, the risk of large-scale capital outflows is quite low as the yuan payment takes place within China's domestic financial system.      Even so, the government is taking steps to rein in speculation. For instance, the Beijing police recently distributed printed notes warning of risks associated with cryptocurrency trading, the Bloomberg report said.

42434448,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPDMrh,1622455225,Ex-Head of China's Digital Yuan Effort Says CBDCs Could Operate on Ethereum,"The former head of the digital currency initiative at the People's Bank of China (PBoC) said central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are set to become more ""smart"" and could one day operate on blockchain networks like Ethereum.      Yao Qian, now director of the Science and Technology Supervision Bureau of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said over the weekend that CBDCs shouldn't attempt to be just a digital form of physical cash, but should incorporate smart contract functionality, Sina Finance reported Monday.      Smart contracts are automatically executing pieces of blockchain code that carry out functions when certain conditions are met, and can also be designed to complement or replace legal contracts.      Yao told the International Finance Forum 2021 Spring Conference in Beijing, however, that the number of security incidents arising from smart contract vulnerabilities shows the technology still needs to mature. Further, there are concerns over the legal status of digital contracts, he said.      As such, central banks should take a cautious approach, starting with simple smart contracts and building complexity as security and legality become more assured.      Yao led the central bank’s digital currency research lab from its inception until he left the PBoC in 2018, moving to the China Securities Regulatory Commission at the end of 2019. He is cited as author or co-author on many of the central bank's patent applications relating to CBDC technology.      The People's Bank has been working on trials of its digital yuan with commercial banks and payment providers. However, a CBDC needn't necessarily be account-based, Yao said.

That would mean central banks could provide CBDCs directly to users without needing intermediaries.

42434466,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPDNRh,1622453838,Bitcoin Eyes Second-Biggest Monthly Drop on Record,"Bitcoin is on track for the second-biggest monthly percentage decline on record, despite bouncing from session lows in Asia.      The cryptocurrency changed hands near $36,200 at 9:00 am UTC, representing a 37.5% loss for May. Prices hit a low of $34,195 early today.      The monthly decline beats the 37% drop seen in November 2018 and is just short of the record 40% slide in September 2011, according to Bitstamp data.      Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, is on track to end May down 12%, the first monthly loss since September 2020. Meanwhile, gold has gained 7%, its biggest monthly rally since July 2020, and the S&P 500 is little changed on the month, per data provided by TradingView.      The bitcoin market looked weak earlier this month amid continued selling by whales, or large investors with an ability to make or break price trends. The cryptocurrency took a beating after Tesla disowned bitcoin as means of payment, citing environmental concerns. The move dashed hopes for widespread corporate adoption raised by the carmaker's decision to adopt bitcoin in February.      The market mood soured further after China's recent regulatory announcements and on concern of an early scaling back of stimulus by the U.S. Federal Reserve.      Bitcoin slumped from $58,000 to almost $30,000 in the eight days to May 19 and has traded sideways ever since, with the upside capped by the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at just above $40,000.      According to blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, the price crash was driven mainly by panic selling by new investors who bought coins during the first-quarter bull run. Meanwhile, holders and institutions have been buying the dip in a sign of confidence in cryptocurrency's long-term price prospects.      The supply held by whale entities – clusters of addresses controlled by a single network participant holding at least 1,000 coins – has increased by over 25,000 BTC to 4.149 million since May 19.      Looking forward, a sustained accumulation by large investors might be needed to restore battered market confidence. The number of whale entities rose in tandem with the price between October and February.      Chart analysts foresee a relief rally in the short term, as the sell-off looks overdone.      ""Bitcoin is newly oversold from an intermediate-term perspective, and there is a new short-term 'buy' signal from the DeMARK Indicators today that supports a two-week rebound,"" Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, said in a weekly research note published on Monday.      DeMark indicators compare the most recent maximum and minimum prices to the previous period's equivalent price to measure the demand of the underlying asset.      Stockton, however, said the bounce is likely to be short-lived because intermediate-term momentum is to the downside, as indicated by the negative reading on the weekly MACD histogram.

According to a press release shared with CoinDesk on Monday, the DBS Digital Bond, issued via its Digital Exchange (DDEx), has a sixth-month expiry and a coupon of 0.6% per annum.      The bank was the sole bookrunner for the transaction, which was completed by way of private placement. Differing from traditional wholesale bonds, the digital bond will be traded in lots of S$10,000 (US$7,600).      DBS said the move paves the way for other issuers and clients to use DDEx's infrastructure to ""efficiently access capital markets"" for their funding needs, and establishes a precedent for further STO issuances and listings.      DBS also said the digital bond complies with the current bond legal framework, providing investors the same legal certainties and protections over their rights as traditional bonds.      ""Our maiden STO listing on the DBS Digital Exchange is a significant milestone, as it highlights the strength of our digital asset ecosystem in facilitating new ways of unlocking value for issuers and investors,"" said Eng-Kwok Seat Moey, group head of Capital Markets at DBS.
