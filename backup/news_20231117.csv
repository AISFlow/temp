20324502,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561161,1700262059,Cardano Falling Wedge Pattern: Analyst Predicts 100% Increase Following Breakout,"Cardano may not be a top gainer in the crypto market but that does not mean that it has fallen behind. During the altcoin rally, the price of Cardano’s native coin ADA has gone from a low of $0.25 to a high of almost $0.4 before correcting back downwards. This positive trend has been preserved even through the crypto market dip and it seems that there is only one thing in the way of Cardano’s rise to a new yearly high. Falling Wedge Pattern Holds Back Cardano According to a crypto analyst on the TradingView website, the one thing that is holding back the Cardano price from mounting a full-blown rally is a falling wedge pattern which it is currently stuck in. This falling wedge pattern has appeared as the ADA price has retraced and then eventually recovered. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Tops 19-Month High: Historical Data Shows What To Expect The crypto analyst who goes by CobraVanguard identifies this falling wedge pattern as the important pattern to break for ADA. As with any cryptocurrency, if ADA is able to break out of this pattern, then a massive rally could follow, ending in a high peak. Source: Tradingview.com CobraVanguard’s price target after breaking out of this falling wedge pattern is over the $0.7 level. Following this trend would mean that the ADA price could rise another 100% from its current level, putting it on a recovery path similar to that of Solana (SOL). The initial target for this recovery is at $0.57 where a small retrace is expected. Afterward, the crypto analyst sees another surge that takes it straight through the $0.78 mark. Then just below $0.8 is where resistance is expected. ADA bulls still holding up price | Source: ADAUSD On Tradingview.com ADA Whales Ramping Up Their Activity As the bull case for Cardano continues, the ADA whales are not being left in the sidelines. As data from IntoTheBlock shows, these large investors have been increasing their activities across the network, especially in the last day. The number of large transactions on the Cardano network, that is transactions carrying $100,000 or more, jumped significantly in the 24-hour period. November 15 numbers came out to 4,320 whereas this number grew to 6,110 on November 16. Related Reading: Ethereum Breakout: Analyst Explains Why The King Of The Altcoins Is Destined For $10,000 Naturally, the transaction volumes of these large investors are also up during this time. It rose from around $7.2 billion on Wednesday to more than $10.46 billion on Thursday, with more than 27.2 billion ADA moved across these transactions. These trends among these large investors could suggest that the anticipation for a bullish run isn’t localized to just smaller investors alone. So whales could be waiting for better prices before they begin profit-taking.

The SEC still needs to approve these applications for them to trade in the U.S. The regulator is mulling bitcoin ETFs, too.  ETFs could make it far easier for the average person to invest money in a crypto-linked asset.  Money management giant Fidelity is seeking to create an exchange-traded fund that owns Ethereum's ether [ETH], according to a Friday filing, joining rival BlackRock in strengthening its crypto embrace.  The Fidelity Ethereum Fund would be listed by an exchange owned by Cboe Global Markets, which posted the fling that revealed the existence of the proposed product. But first, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission must decide whether to approve the ether ETF, as it must for others including one from BlackRock, which was revealed earlier this month.

20322395,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561247,1700258421,"CoinShares Predicts $141,000 Bitcoin Price, Forecasts $14.4 Billion Inflows From ETFs","In a recently published report by CoinShares, analyst James Butterfill delves into the relationship between inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and changes in the Bitcoin price. The report addresses the critical question of how much inflow into ETFs could be anticipated upon launching a Bitcoin spot ETF in the US and the potential impact of these flows on the Bitcoin Price. Bitcoin ETFs Could Attract $14.4 Billion Inflows Butterfill highlights Galaxy’s analysis, which estimates that the United States has approximately $14.4 trillion in addressable assets. Assuming a conservative scenario where 10% of these assets invest in a spot Bitcoin ETF with an average allocation of 1%, it could result in approximately $14.4 billion of inflows within the first year. Per the report, this would mark the largest inflows on record, surpassing 2021’s inflows of $7.24 billion, which accounted for 11.5% of assets under management (AuM). However, it is worth noting that in 2020, inflows reached $5.5 billion, representing a higher 21.6% of AuM, while Bitcoin’s price surged by 303% compared to 60% in 2021. Related Reading: Dogecoin Jumps 10%, But This Signal Could Bring Rally To A Stop The report suggests a correlation between inflows as a percentage of AuM and price changes. Inflows coincide with rising prices, indicating that many ETF investors engage in momentum trading. Conversely, during periods of price stagnation, inflows have tended to moderate. However, it is important to note that exchange-traded product (ETP) investors do not necessarily lead price action, as evidenced by volume data indicating that ETP volumes represent an average of 3.5% of daily Bitcoin trading turnover on trusted exchanges since 2018. Bitcoin Price Surge Predicted By analyzing weekly ETP flows and their percentage of AuM, the report identifies a trend with a coefficient of determination (R2 ) value of 0.31, suggesting a discernible relationship between flows and price changes. Utilizing this trendline, the report estimates that the aforementioned $14.4 billion of inflows could potentially drive the price of Bitcoin up to $141,000 per coin. Nevertheless, accurately predicting the precise level of inflows upon the launch of spot ETFs remains challenging. The report acknowledges the difficulty in determining the exact magnitude of inflows. It emphasizes that regulatory approval and corporate acceptance are gradual processes due to Bitcoin’s perceived complexity, which may require corporations and funds to build knowledge and confidence before committing to investment. Related Reading: Cardano Breakout Of Epic Proportions: Analyst Predicts 1600% Rally To $6.5 The potential wall of demand that could materialize following the introduction of a spot-based ETF is uncertain. While such ETFs offer portfolio diversification and enhanced Sharpe ratios, regulatory approval and corporate adoption may take time due to perceived complexities associated with Bitcoin. Ultimately, CoinShares believes that Corporations and funds may require an extended period to familiarize themselves with the asset class and gain confidence before entering the market. All in all, the CoinShares report sheds light on the potential impact of Bitcoin ETFs on the price of BTC. While it is challenging to precisely determine the level of inflows and their subsequent effect on the market, the report suggests that launching a Bitcoin spot ETF in the US could potentially drive the price of Bitcoin to US$141,000 per coin. Currently, Bitcoin (BTC) is consolidating above the significant psychological level of $36,000. Over the past 24 hours, it has experienced a minimal decrease of 0.2%, while showing a 1.3% increase within the 1-hour time frame.

20320595,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561085,1700254823,"History Repeats? Cardano (ADA) Set To Skyrocket In December, Predicts Analyst","A recent surge in Cardano (ADA)’s market value has caught the attention of both investors and analysts alike. Over the past 24 hours, ADA has seen a 7% increase, trading at approximately $0.39 at the time of writing. This uptick in value is not just a momentary blip on the radar but a part of a broader trend that mirrors the 2018-2020 consolidation phase of ADA, according to a well-known crypto trader and analyst, Ali. Interestingly, the analyst noted this current consolidation phase comes without the dramatic influence of an event like the Covid-19 crash. Related Reading: Cardano Price Poised To Rally 650% By July 2024: Crypto Analyst Cardano (ADA) To Skyrocket In December Ali has expressed insights on X (formerly known as Twitter), drawing parallels between ADA’s current market behavior and its historical trajectory. If these patterns hold, Ali suggests that ADA might soon break through the $0.45 resistance level, potentially as early as the first week of December. #Cardano‘s current consolidation trend eerily mirrors the 2018-2020 phase without the COVID-19 crash! If so, $ADA could break through the $0.45 resistance around the first week of December. The upswing could send #ADA to $0.75 by late December. Looking to trade this setup? Head… pic.twitter.com/u3KzOsZj2F — Ali (@ali_charts) November 16, 2023 Currently, ADA is trading at around $0.39. Despite a recent uptick in its weekly performance, the asset has experienced a minor pullback from its 24-hour high of $0.40. Although this peak approaches the resistance level highlighted by analyst Ali, ADA appears poised for a potential rally. This is indicated by a significant increase in its daily trading volume, which has risen by over $200 million in the past day, suggesting heightened trading activity for the crypto. Furthermore, as the year approaches, Ali’s prediction for ADA’s price to reach as high as $0.75 during the festive season seems to gain credibility with the recent surge. If ADA continues on this trajectory, it could signify a notable milestone in its journey and potentially reshape investor perspectives on Cardano’s role in the competitive crypto landscape. Media Spotlight And Ethereum’s Alleged Imitation It is worth noting that the recent spotlight on ADA can be partly attributed to the statements made by Steven Nerayoff, a prominent figure in the crypto sphere known for his critical views on Ethereum. Nerayoff’s declaration of ADA as his “top pick in crypto” has fueled media discussions and increased interest in Cardano. His recent public criticism of Ethereum, accusing the platform of imitating Cardano’s innovations, has added a layer of intrigue to the ongoing narrative. This controversy particularly concerns Ethereum revisiting its Plasma scaling solution, first introduced in 2017. What timing! This is why I just said @Cardano_CF is my top pick in crypto. You will hear on the recording me telling @VitalikButerin he made a major mistake in getting rid of @IOHK_Charles & should bring him back. Are the clueless smug @ethereum cultists who got rid of Charles… https://t.co/x5w6yDRB4M — Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 15, 2023 Members of the Cardano community have not hesitated to point out the similarities between Ethereum’s Plasma and Cardano’s Hydra, a Layer-2 scaling solution. They argue that Plasma’s recent developments closely resemble Hydra’s functionalities. Related Reading: Cardano October Whale Frenzy – What Lies Ahead For November?

42409461,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHXl1,1700252196,Disney Does NOT ‘Partner’ With Crypto Companies,"On Tuesday, I wrote and published a column breaking the news of and reflecting on Dapper Labs' recently announced tie-up with Disney, the storied, 100-year-old entertainment company which, under CEO Bob Iger’s leadership, has become even more of an intellectual property owning powerhouse and tech follower. This article contained a few errors.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Most embarrassingly I misspelled the surname of one of my sources, Dapper Labs vice president of partnerships Ridhima Khan, and misattributed one of her quotes to CEO Roham Gharegozlou. Those errors have been corrected, and are regretted.  More importantly, however, a central claim of the article — that Dapper and Disney were “partners” in a venture called Disney Pinnacle, which will license Disney IP and sell digital tokens modeled after collectible pins — now appears to be incorrect.  As per Dapper Labs head of PR Rachel Rogers, on Thursday, two days after the story published:  “Also, Disney didn’t launch the Disney Pinnacle platform. Dapper Labs did in collaboration with Disney. Can you update? Disney does not use the word partner - only collaborates with or teams up with.”  The news was picked up by and cited by a number of widely-read tech news outlets, some of which have received similar requests from Dapper to wipe the term partner from the record. I’m writing this story, in part, to correct the record: Disney is not partnering with Dapper. Disney, which has not responded to a request for comment, will likely never partner with a crypto company.  Instead, Disney is licensing its IP to Dapper. The terms and conditions of the deal are unknown. When asked, Dapper said: “Like all of our partnerships, we can’t comment on financial breakdowns."" I asked a few different ways, a few different times in a call with Khan and Gharegozlou as well as in emailed follow up questions.  It’s not unreasonable to think that “a licensed partner for Disney,” as Dapper also initially described the arrangement, could be paying for the privilege. Such financial deals are not uncommon in the world of NFTs. What is being licensed is valuable property.  In a call, Gharegozlou and Khan suggested Disney has been in close contact with Dapper through the development process — though Dapper is doing all the building. The mobile app is not yet launched, only the waitlist opened on Tuesday.  In my article, I basically argued that this project could have potential to be one of the few non-cringy NFT experiments. I argued that Disney has a large fanbase, full of people who like to collect Disney junk. It makes sense to work with recognizable content that people already have an emotional connection with, rather than to get them to buy what could be described as a JPEG with a blockchain pointer.  Otherwise, you end up with something like the Bored Ape Yacht Club, because it's next to impossible to build a brand from the ground up. And the Yacht Club is essentially the most successful “bootstrapped” NFT project to date, if you want to call paying or otherwise enticing celebrities to shill their bags bootstrapped.  I mean, as I argued, Dapper’s earlier experience could also be called successful by the standards of crypto. NBA Top Shots, where Dapper pioneered the concept of licensing beloved IP to sell tokens, does not see much action today, but at one time it was essentially the crown jewel of Dapper properties and significant part of the reason Dapper was, now in hindsight, comically overvalued.  Assuming Disney Pinnacle is still happening – even though it seems like Disney chewed Dapper out for claiming they were “partnered” in a crypto cash grab – it might even still be successful. People buy Disney merchandise even though it is often intrinsically valueless, and it’s not yet clear whether Disney fanatics have a guttural hatred of NFTs like some consumer segments, like gamers.  See also: 'Probably Nothing': Why People Still Hate Crypto | Opinion  It could work! And if it does, it’ll be as much because of Dapper’s design work as Disney’s property. But it’s not a partnership.  I’m not exactly sure why Gharegozlou, Khan and Rogers were all so adamant about calling it a partnership. The term was used a lot. And I made sure to ask several times in several different ways how to describe the working relationship precisely because crypto companies often incorrectly use the term partner or oversell their relationships with established brands.  Like, I’m pretty sure I’ve seen a company call a Google Cloud subscription a deal. Ethereum is reliant on Amazon, but Amazon is not an Ethereum backer in any traditional sense.  And I get it, at least in Dapper’s case I’m sure it was an honest mistake. Khan said she went to Disneyland nearly 20 times as the main liaison and reason the non-partnership happened between Disney and Dapper. I enjoyed speaking with them, and thought Gharegozlou to be uncommonly gregarious for someone in his position.  . But I do find the request to essentially retcon the story morally questionable. As I told Rogers in an email, “I cannot change quotes, and I cannot change the fact that partner/partnership was the term used by Roham and Ridhima and in written communications from the company.”  I can’t change their quotes. At the time of publication the information was accurate. We’re not in the business of doing favors for companies, and if we granted this request it would open a can of worms for everytime a source says something on the record they come to regret.  The part of the job I like best is calling a spade a spade. Another one of Dapper’s ignominious requests was to change a comment made about “investing” in NFTs when asked about the differences between digital and tangible collectibles. I get it, discussing NFTs as financial assets opens up a regulatory attack surface. But to suggest that you can INVEST in physical pins but only COLLECT digital ones is silly.  See also: Dapper Labs Lays Off 51 as NFT Market Stays Chilly  NFTs are investments, they're treated as investments and in my brief communications with Dapper we spoke about them as investments and collectibles. And in the absence of any solid information about the “pins,” like whether they come with perks like Disney discounts or opportunities, presumably one of the major reasons to buy one is because it could appreciate in value.  Dapper is not alone here. Crypto has an honesty crisis. The industry is not only overrun with fraud, literal measurable fraud, it is in the business of deceiving people. Crypto is a technology without a use case, which is promised to solve every problem and has failed by nearly every measure. The thing crypto is actually good for — buying things online you don’t want on a credit card statement — is entirely underplayed.  There is no way a decade of misrepresentation does not end up causing collateral damage. In many ways it already has. Crypto has a bad reputation, and not even in a cool way — in a way that screams low social standing and dishonesty. And for good reason. Millions of people collectively lost billions of dollars. A technology that is supposed to be about sticking it to the man is obsequious.  In other words: Crypto is cringy and untrustworthy. It is the George Santos of financial technology.

42409454,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHXNs,1700252031,What You Need to Know About Crypto Tax Loss Harvesting,"Tax-loss harvesting is a strategy that you can use to minimize your tax liability. By selling investments with unrealized losses, you can realize a capital loss that you can use to offset capital gains made on other investments or up to $3,000 in ordinary income each year.  The controversial part of tax-loss harvesting comes if and when you repurchase the investment. If you immediately repurchase the same investment, you’ve essentially represented that you lost money when you haven’t really lost anything – you still own the same asset!  The IRS discourages these superficial transactions with the Wash Sale Rule. While the agency hasn’t clarified whether the rule applies to cryptocurrencies, many regulators and legislators have expressed interest in closing what they see as a loophole.  In this article, we’ll get you up to speed on what a wash sale is, the rules applying to them, and how you can time your trades to avoid running afoul of these complicated rules.  What is a wash sale?  IRS Publication 550 defines a ""wash sale"" as a sale that occurs when you sell or trade stock or securities at a loss and within 30 days before or after the sale you:  Buy substantially identical stock or securities.   Acquire substantially identical stock or securities in a fully taxable trade.   Acquire a contract or option to buy substantially identical stock or securities.   Acquire substantially identical stock or securities for your individual retirement accounts.   This definition begs the question: What is a ""substantially identical"" stock or security?  The IRS says you must ""consider all the facts and circumstances in your particular base"" when making that determination. As an example of this ambiguity, ordinary stocks or securities of one corporation are generally not substantially identical to those of another. But, in a reorganization, the predecessor’s stock may be ""substantially identical.""  The Wash Sale Rule prohibits investors from deducting the sales or trades of ""stock or securities"" in a wash sale (unless you’re a dealer in stock or securities).  If you think about it, selling stock to realize a loss and immediately repurchasing the asset results in a net-unchanged economic position for you. You owned the same asset with the same economic exposure as before – you're only changing your cost basis!  The IRS doesn’t want you to deduct losses on an investment if you haven’t actually incurred an economic loss. In other words, they’re okay with deducting a loss if you sell an investment and move on to a different one. But not if you maintain your same exposure.  The only exception occurs if you sell several securities and repurchase far fewer. In that case, the IRS lets you specify which shares you want the Wash Sale Rule to apply to.  Does It Apply to Crypto?  The IRS states that the Wash Sale Rule applies to ""stock or securities"" but hasn’t clarified whether that means cryptocurrencies. Currently, the IRS considers cryptocurrencies ""property"" rather than ""securities,"" which suggests that the rules don't apply at the moment.  However, legislators seem keen on applying the Wash Sale Rule to crypto investors. For instance, on July 12, 2023, a bipartisan group of Senators reintroduced the Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act to create a regulatory framework for digital assets and apply the Wash Sale rule to digital assets.  Moreover, even if the Wash Sale Rule did apply to cryptocurrencies, the IRS would have to provide guidance on how to treat certain transactions. There is a lot of ambiguity surrounding how one might interpret whether tokens are ""substantially identical.""  For example, different tokens on the same blockchain are unlikely to be ""substantially identical"" because they have different functionalities and use cases. For instance, ETH and ERC-20 tokens are incredibly different in their economics and the rationale for ownership.  However, several crypto assets could fall under the ""substantially identical"" designation:  Cryptocurrencies forked from the same original blockchain  Stablecoins are pegged to the same underlying asset(s)  Wrapped tokens (e.g., bitcoin and wrapped bitcoin).  Since there’s no clear guidance from the IRS, these scenarios would be up for interpretation. If you’re not clear and wish to follow the Wash Sale Rule, just in case, the safest approach would be to consult a tax advisor familiar with crypto assets.  A Breakdown of the Timing  The Wash Sale Rule applies to transactions made 30 days before or after the sale. So, even if you wait to repurchase the asset until 30 days after, you also must have not purchased it originally within 30 days beforehand to avoid a wash sale.  In addition, it’s critical to remember that the Wash Sale Rule applies to all your accounts. So, even if you haven’t purchased Bitcoin in one wallet over the past 30 days, the loss may be invalid if you purchased it on a different exchange.  For example, suppose that you purchased $50,000 worth of bitcoin on Coinbase. After 40 days, the price fell, and you sold the position for $40,000, incurring a $10,000 loss. Then, in a Ledger wallet transaction, you repurchased Bitcoin for $42,000 five days later.  In this scenario, you would have to disallow the $10,000 loss for tax-deduction purposes. Instead, the $10,000 loss would be added to the cost basis of the new Bitcoin you purchased, making the new cost basis $52,000 ($42,000 + $10,000).  If you want to avoid the wash sale, the sale transaction would have had to occur between Day 10 (30 days before Day 40) and Day 70 (30 days after Day 40). Alternatively, you could have repurchased a different asset instead of Bitcoin (such as Ethereum) and realized the tax loss.  The easiest way to avoid mistiming tax-loss harvesting transactions is to use an automated tool to identify valid opportunities. By relying on algorithms, these tools can automatically determine eligible assets and factor in all your wallets, exchanges, or other accounts. For example, ZenLedger’s tax loss harvesting tool can help you pinpoint opportunities at any time because of the ability to track accurate cost-basis across an entire portfolio.  Impact of Accounting Methods  The accounting methods you use to determine cost basis could also impact your tax loss harvesting strategy. While these methods don’t directly impact the Wash Sale Rule, they can affect how a wash sale is calculated or identified and influence your taxes.  For example, FIFO (first in-first out), LIFO (last in-first out), and other accounting methods affect the cost basis of the assets you use to “replace” the ones you sold in a wash sale. This altered cost basis carries forward to future sales, affecting the calculation of your capital gains or losses.  In addition, if a wash sale occurs, the disallowed loss is generally added to the cost basis of the new ""substantially identical"" security. This rule may affect your portfolio differently depending on your accounting method.  The Bottom Line  The IRS’ Wash Sale Rule doesn’t necessarily apply to cryptocurrencies yet, but conservative investors may want to follow the rules anyway. If you fall under that group of investors, understanding the timing around wash sales can help you make the most of your tax-loss harvesting efforts and avoid running afoul of any future rules and regulations.

BlackRock Files For An Ethereum Spot ETF Following its Spot Bitcoin ETF filing, BlackRock, an American investment company has taken the proactive step by filing an Ethereum Spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The asset management company submitted the application on November 15, however, BlackRock has stated it formed the Trust as early as November 9. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Brink: Factors That Indicate A DOGE Rally Is Just Starting According to BlackRock, the iShares Ethereum Trust would be used to facilitate the ownership of Ether through the issuance of shares, allowing investors to own a fractional undivided beneficial interest in the net assets of the Trust. “The Trust was formed as a Delaware statutory trust on November 9, 2023. The purpose of the Trust is to own ether transferred to the Trust in exchange for Shares issued by the Trust. Each Share represents a fractional undivided beneficial interest in the net assets of the Trust. The assets of the Trust consist primarily of ether held by the Ether Custodian on behalf of the Trust,” BlackRock said in its filing. Presently, the US SEC has not approved any Ethereum Spot ETF filing as well as Spot Bitcoin ETF applications. The regulatory body has delayed multiple applications to be reviewed from January 2024. The crypto community has remained enthusiastic that the regulatory agency would eventually approve the pending ETF applications, as this could significantly push the growth and development of the crypto ecosystem as well as the cryptocurrencies involved. Ethereum Price Surges The price of Ethereum is on the rise following BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF filing. The cryptocurrency’s price climbed almost 2% moving to $2,080 at some point following the announcement of the filing.

The upcoming halving event and hodler wallets indicate a bullish fundamental setup for BTC. Bitcoin is currently overbought and a pullback to $31-33k could happen, but long-term prospects for GBTC shares remain positive. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has been on a rocket in 2023. Year to date, the price of BTC has essentially doubled. And the performance since mid-September has been particularly impressive as well with BTC moving from $25k per coin up to just under $38k per coin on November 15th. Year to date, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has outperformed BTC and the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) by a significant margin: Data by YCharts GBTC shareholders have been riding speculation that a spot bitcoin ETF will soon be approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Since the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has traded at such a large discount to NAV over the last couple of years, the possibility of a spot ETF coupled with a successful court battle has fueled optimism in Grayscale's ETF conversion hopes. The notion that approval of a spot bitcoin ETF would be bullish for Grayscale is an idea that I've explored for Seeking Alpha in the past. Data by YCharts Since my last GBTC article in August, we've seen the discount to net asset value close from 25% to just 10%. With the arbitrage opportunity quickly closing in GBTC, I think it's a good time to reassess this idea. In this article, we'll take an updated look at BTC fundamentals and by extension the setup for GBTC shareholders. Beyond that, I'm going to do something that I don't always do in my Seeking Alpha articles; we'll look at technicals as well. Bitcoin's Fundamental Setup At this point in time, I think the most important fundamental data point is how far away we are from the next halving. With roughly 150 days remaining, we are getting very close to what has traditionally been a significant catalyst in the price appreciation of BTC. Block Rewards (LookIntoBitcoin) Of course, the old adage is past performance is not an indicator of future returns. But this indicator has been pretty good so far. Every four years the block reward from mining is cut in half. This means that provided demand remains the same, the price of the currency will rise. That rise in price fuels more demand and BTC enters a bubble. Supply by time held (IntoTheBlock) We can see on-chain that ""hodler"" wallets, or BTC in wallet addresses that haven't moved in at least a year, are gaining a share of supply. At 69.8% of the total BTC supply, the ""hodlers"" have control of their largest share of BTC that we've seen to this point so far. To put it another way, long-term holders are likely not selling at these levels with a halving just a few months away. And the reason is due to the supply/demand dynamic described above. Historically, the price of BTC has been many multiples higher a year after a halving event: Halving Price At Halving Price 100 Days Later Price 1 Year Later 2012 $12 $42 $964 2016 $663 $609 $2,550 2020 $8,740 $11,950 $56,753 Source: StormGain, TradingView Coinbase price Something else to consider is the fact that Bitcoin hasn't yet experienced a halving cycle with a Fed Funds rate of 5%. However, the equity market seems to believe we're at the end of that hiking cycle. If that is indeed the case, the current expectation for March rate cuts may have the same positive impact on BTC that it has had for equities in November. March Fed Meeting (CME) To summarize; Bitcoin holders aren't selling, new issuance will become twice as scarce in April, and the market is expecting a rate cut in March. I believe the fundamental setup for BTC favors bulls. The technical setup is a bit more debatable. Bitcoin's Technical Setup Bitcoin is overbought. There I said it. Up until this recent pullback, BTC has been hugely overbought on the daily chart for about two weeks. BTC Daily 11/17/23 (Investing.com) However, during significant uptrends, bitcoin tends to stay overbought for long periods of time. What can be observed on the daily chart to help us pick spots for profit-taking in our derivatives or swing trades is when we see higher highs in price coming with lower highs in RSI-14. We saw this at the beginning of the year, during the summer, and we're starting to see it again now. What we've often seen when BTC gets this overbought is a return to a previous level of support/resistance and an oversold reading on the RSI. We obviously don't have that currently, but we'll likely get it in the coming weeks or months. At that point, it'll be safer to go long provided the broader trend is favoring bulls as it is currently: BTC Weekly 11/17/23 (Investing.com) Look, I'm not a TA wizard. I try to keep this stuff very simple and I look for important pivot points. I generally DCA my major long-term positions, of which BTC is one. But for swing trade capital, it's prudent to be mindful of technical signals and I think we're going to see a pullback down to somewhere between $31-33k in BTC. Will BTC hit $40k first before that pullback comes? That's certainly possible, but most of us don't sell tops or buy bottoms. Risks The main risk with holding any cryptocurrency or cryptocurrency derivative is the perceived volatility against fiat currencies. These assets can whipsaw 30-40% in a very short amount of time. There is added risk with longing cryptocurrency trusts because they introduce counterparty risk to assets that are designed specifically not to require custodian counterparties. I should also mention that there is a level of uncertainty regarding Grayscale's parent company Digital Currency Group. Given that, it may be prudent to make sure you don't get overexposed to Grayscale as an asset manager. Related parties often own large percentages of the Grayscale shares outstanding and any forced liquidations from those related parties could depress NAV discounts if the market for the fund shares weakens. In the Q3 10-Q for GBTC, we saw related parties increase GBTC share count by just a few hundred shares from Q2. However, the total amount of shares held by related parties is slightly above 36 million, which is slightly over 5% of the shares outstanding. Grayscale's funds also notoriously have high fees. Especially considering the company isn't actively managing the assets against price volatility or lending them out for yield. BTC held with Grayscale is simply sitting in cold storage through Coinbase (COIN). Summary Despite the risks associated with relying on a third party for bitcoin exposure, one of the primary reasons that I do hold GBTC is that the fund shares are a phenomenal trading vehicle for those who want to do that trading in a tax-advantaged account rather than through a centralized exchange or through a cross-chain DEX protocol like THORChain (RUNE-USD). I've minimized my exposure to GBTC, in part because the NAV window has closed considerably, and also because I think BTC will go through some consolidation before it takes another leg higher. I suspect the gains for the year in GBTC have been had and it's wise to lock in some of this win. Again, I'm still personally long GBTC, but I think NAV traders will do better by rotating some GBTC profit into Grayscale's Digital Large Cap fund (GDLC) instead. All this said, if your time horizon is 12 to 18 months from now GBTC shares will likely be priced higher than they are today.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4652740-grayscale-bitcoin-trust-lightening-but-still-long?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/20317035.jpeg

20314446,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561214,1700244003,"Is $40,000 Next? Unpacking 4 Reasons Behind Bitcoin’s Emerging Rally","The Bitcoin price rally is losing strength as the cryptocurrency returns to its support levels following weeks of bullish momentum. In the short term, the landscape seems sloped to the downside, but an analyst presented the main reasons why the rally has just begun. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Holds Ground – Indicators Suggest Fresh Surge To $2,120 As of this writing, Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $36,550 with a 2% loss in the last 24 hours. Over the previous week, the cryptocurrency recorded similar losses following the general sentiment in the market. Only Solana (SOL) preserved its gains during the same period. Behind Bitcoin’s Surge: Decoding the Four Key Factors According to a report from Deribit Insight, posted by Markus Thielen, several forces are pushing Bitcoin towards new yearly highs. These forces remain intact despite the recent price action. Among the reasons behind the current BTC price rally, the analyst included speculations around the U.S. Securities And Exchange Commission (SEC) Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund decision, traders’ appetite for leverage, fiat inflows through stablecoins, and increased fee generation within the Bitcoin network. SEC’s Decision On The Bitcoin ETFs A significant driver is the anticipation surrounding the SEC’s approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. Despite passing the second deadline in mid-October without any announcement, the market remains watchful, with the third deadline set for mid-January 2024. The uncertainty surrounding this decision has led to fluctuations in implied volatility, influencing Bitcoin’s value. Leveraged Positions and Futures Market The demand for leveraged positions in Bitcoin, primarily through perpetual futures markets, indicates a strong interest in trading the BTC/USDT pair. This was evident when the funding premium reached an annualized +28% on November 13. In addition, the BTC options market saw an uptick in realized volatility. The increase in the metric signals risk appetite for investors. The chart below shows that the metric approaches its 5-year average. However, the analyst believes that volatility should decline as the year ends, suggesting that Bitcoin will follow a sideways trajectory in the short term. Influx of Fiat Via Stablecoins Another crucial aspect is the substantial fiat inflow into cryptocurrencies, mainly through Tether’s USDT, indicating fresh capital entering the crypto space. With over $3.8 billion moving into crypto in the last 30 days, this influx has had a notable impact, especially on altcoins, reflecting growing investor confidence. Increased Bitcoin Network Activity The Bitcoin network’s fee generation signals heightened activity, reaching $54 million. The report claims that this growth in network usage, partly driven by the resurgence of Ordinals and support from major exchanges, underscores the fundamental strength of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Despite these positive indicators, the absence of an SEC Bitcoin ETF approval and a reduction in leveraged long positions might prevent Bitcoin from soaring past the $40,000 mark. However, the ongoing solid fiat inflows and a robust, fee-generating Bitcoin network provide grounds for cautious optimism.

42409483,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHkln,1700243418,"CBDCs Like a Digital Dollar Face Doubts Without Privacy Protections, Key Organization Finds","A Bank for International Settlements report found that privacy is viewed as a key component of CBDC design.  More countries are exploring the use of CBDCs.  Central banks have toyed for years with the idea of issuing digital versions of their nations' currencies – a digital dollar and the like.  These so-called central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, are envisioned being built atop blockchains, the ledger technology invented in the cryptocurrency realm, where expectations of privacy run high.  A new study from the Bank for International Settlements has found that prospective CBDC users will likely make similar demands and that privacy protection should be considered.  The report from BIS, colloquially known as the central bank for the world's central banks, queried 3,500 people on how their use of a CBDC as a means of payment would vary depending on the level of privacy. The provision of information on privacy was also an important factor.  ""We find that both factors significantly increase participants' willingness to use CBDC by up to 60% when purchasing privacy-sensitive products,"" according to the report, which was conducted by researchers not on the BIS staff.  More countries are exploring the use of CBDCs. Privacy has not always been viewed as a core goal. Nations like the U.S. have said that their CBDC will not be anonymous.  ""Our findings imply that as long as CBDC is designed to provide sufficient anonymity and protect privacy while meeting the AML [anti-money laundering] and/or CFT [combating the financing of terrorism] regulations, it is more likely to substitute the existing payment instruments provided by the private sector, including commercial banks' demand deposits,"" the report said.  The experiment found that when CBDCs are available for offline purchases, they are the second-most-popular means of payment (picked by 27.3% of respondents) after credit or debit cards (31.3%). For online purchases, CBDCs are the most-popular (42%) when privacy-sensitive products are being purchased and in second place (29.7%) for privacy-insensitive products.  CBDCs would be an officially issued version of a currency. They already have private-sector competition in the form of stablecoins like Tether's USDT and Circle Internet Financial's USDC. Each of those tokens is supposed to always be worth close to $1, making them a blockchain-powered stand-in for the old-fashioned U.S. dollar.  The BIS recently released a report looking critically at stablecoins, arguing that not one of the ones its researchers observed had managed to maintain its peg to its underlying currency and advocated for CBDCs.

42409487,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHkvi,1700240962,A Year After FTX: The Lesson Europe Has Fixated On,"November 11 marked a year from the day FTX formally declared bankruptcy, and, of course, nine days from Sam Bankman-Fried being found guilty on all criminal counts against him and sentenced to lifetime imprisonment.  The symbolism of the trial is debatable. It is sometimes talked about as a policymakers’ catharsis, as it could allow those that engaged SBF with trust to conclude that justice has been done and move on. An alternative view is that FTX exposed the crypto market for its vulnerabilities and, now the hype is gone, the market ain’t coming back.  Dea Markova is a managing director and head of digital assets at Forefront Advisers.  These are both overly simplistic. Having an adequately regulated crypto-asset market would allow policymakers to attract more risk-averse and institutional capital to the asset class. Yet, it is true that the downfall of FTX framed regulatory conversations around the world and made them overly adversarial. In London, in Brussels (where I’m based) and at international fora, the industry needs to explain how it would ensure against an FTX-size catastrophe.  The lessons we already knew  In reality, the majority of the crypto industry is aligned on the answers – proper authorization, proper custody, and proper client asset segregation. These are core principles of running an investment business, and there is no real argument over them (leaving to one side the U.S. regulation-by-enforcement reality).  The move many exchanges made towards proof-of-reserves in principle supports client asset segregation, although it has limitations as an accounting technique. More broadly, in 2023, in markets with strong regulators, exchanges are keen to be seen as responsible.  Read more: Dea Markova - The Digital Euro and the P Word  For anyone with a financial services background, this is a natural next step. It is not a paradigm shift. The FTX collapse just made the penny drop faster for service providers that might have had second thoughts.  In November 2022, such requirements were already in train in the E.U. under the bloc-wide Markets in Crypto-assets Regulation (MiCA). By the time the FTX saga unfolded, the ink was dry. Any subsequent MiCA updates are just part of the long administrative process that precedes the publication and application of E.U. rules.  That is why Brussels policymakers spent the past year telling each other and the rest of the world their incoming rulebook would have prevented an FTX-style collapse. For the most part, this is true. Also, it has to be – the part of MiCA which safeguards exchanges will not be reviewed for another five years or so, and it cannot be seen as already out of date.  Those following MiCA closely would know that there is a still ongoing process of writing supplementary “technical rules.” If it were a national process, this would be the difference between the law itself and the implementing technicalities coming from the regulator.  FTX politicized this process in the EU. It was Europe’s last chance to make sure the screws are tightened as much as possible. But the technical rules cannot go outside of the parameters already set in the top-level law. We are almost at the end of the rule-writing, and not much of what has come out of the last year has been unexpected or, dare I say, draconian.  On the subject of properly splitting up assets and activities, there is an outstanding question how much is enough. Especially when one company is an exchange, has its native token, and offers lending. This remains a debate at international level – where the SEC coordinates and seeks to influence other market coordinators.  This question will not stand before the EU for the next few years, but it may come back and it may also reverberate around the world.  The lessons we didn’t learn  The biggest disagreement FTX left behind is also the most basic one. What is the crypto-asset market is good for, what value does it bring to society given it clearly brings some risks.  While we may brush it away and say it is not up to regulators to pre-determine market innovation so long as it’s safe, we must recognise that writing and implementing the safety rules is a massive effort.  The industry should not hide behind the narrative that regulators lack knowledge. This is no longer the case for many authorities around the world. However, if we don’t want to default to risk-aversion, taking a chance on an industry needs to be politically justified. Therefore, answering the value-to-society question matters.  There are many industry answers to this question but they usually come back to disintermediation and decentralization. This is the promise of blockchain in various shapes and forms.  To regulators, however, these words translate to avoiding responsibility and preserving anonymity. Soon, they will also translate to inability to detect a carbon footprint. Even though EU authorities have a clear agenda to limit the natural monopolies of Web2, a decentralized Web3 is not being discussed as the answer in the corridors of power. The cost of having an anonymous (or pseudonymous) and un-regulatable DeFi ecosystem is too high.  If the industry is to move away from this polemic, perhaps non-custodial services and anonymous services need not be coupled together. This choice goes to the heart of why crypto was invented, and many may disagree.  Yet, crypto advocates will have a much easier time explaining how the technology that allows users to own their funds and their data is not the same technology that allows money laundering and terrorism financing.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Dea Markova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/11/17/a-year-after-ftx-the-lesson-europe-has-fixated-on,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/572c4beb84a528abdf10b618045350f32dc5a54b-5200x2925.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Price activity suggests that Cardano is moving into a state of consolidation, which coincides with a moderate decline in the general cryptocurrency market. Nevertheless, the analyst is of the opinion that Cardano’s current consolidation is similar to one it had prior to a 2980% increase. If previous events are any indicator, we could see Cardano mirror this move and spike past its all-time high. Recent Cardano Price Action Cardano is still up by 48.47% in a 30-day timeframe, but it has lost 7.21% of its market value in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $0.372. According to chart analysis by Ali Martinez, the current consolidation looks similar to the 2018-2020 consolidation phase without considering the COVID-19 crash. Related Reading: Over 100 Million MATIC Incinerated In POLS Mint, But The Gold Rush Is Far From Over Following the conclusion of this phase, Cardano witnessed price surges in the first quarter of 2021, one of which was a price surge of nearly 100% in seven days in early February 2021. This marked the beginning of a prolonged bullish run that drove Cardano’s price up by more than 2980% and brought it to its current all-time high of $3.10 in September 2021. #Cardano‘s current consolidation trend eerily mirrors the 2018-2020 phase without the COVID-19 crash! If so, $ADA could break through the $0.45 resistance around the first week of December. The upswing could send #ADA to $0.75 by late December. Looking to trade this setup? Head… pic.twitter.com/u3KzOsZj2F — Ali (@ali_charts) November 16, 2023 If analyst Ali Martinez is right, Cardano is on the cusp of a massive breakout that could send the price of ADA skyrocketing in the same manner. A look through his price chart shared on social media estimates the price of Cardano surging past the $6.5 level, a surge of more than 1,600%. The journey to this price level is certainly not going to be a smooth one. ADA is going to face major resistance at the $0.45 level, which it has to break through to start with. This won’t be easy, as the coin has already tried and failed to break through this barrier in April. It did go over to reach $0.4533 on April 16, but it fell 15% to 0.383 by April 22nd. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Literally Going To The Moon: 100% DOGE Price Blast Expected According to the analyst, if a strong price spike were to occur now, ADA could break past $0.45 by the first week of December. If Cardano breaks $0.45, the next stop would be $0.75 by late December, a 66% increase from current levels. According to Coinmarketcap’s Fear & Greed Index, the crypto market is now at a greed level of 71. For Cardano to mimic the 2021 bull run, the overall crypto market sentiment would need to maintain this very strong bullish and greed level. Interest in altcoins would have to pick up, and Cardano’s progress on key milestones like smart contracts and DeFi would need to drive hype.

42409477,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHkRx,1700239455,New Form 1099-DA: What it Means for Digital Asset Brokers and Their Customers,"Arguably, one of the largest developments affecting the digital asset industry this year comes from a sleepy corner of the tax law. In August, the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service issued proposed regulations implementing a law that extended Form 1099 information reporting by securities brokers to digital asset brokers.  The proposed regulations would apply broadly to many businesses in the digital asset ecosystem, which will require them to set up systems to collect and report the information to the IRS and their customers and require collection of most of the information beginning in 2025, and since we do not anticipate final regulations until sometime next year, companies will have little time to set up their systems.  This post is part of CoinDesk's Tax Week 2023, presented by TaxBit.  Here we discuss the broad scope of the proposed digital asset reporting regulations and what it might mean for potential brokers and their customers.  Background  Before the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, section 6045 generally required brokers to file information returns on Form 1099-B for each customer for whom the broker sold stocks, commodities, regulated futures contracts, and other specified financial instruments. The Form 1099-B is filed with the IRS, and a copy is sent to the customer so that the customer has the information needed to complete and file their tax return. The IRS then matches the Form 1099-B to the tax return and identifies any under-reported amounts.  Because of this matching process, Americans’ voluntary tax compliance increases substantially when there is third-party information reporting. For example, the U.S. Government Accountability Office published an analysis in December 2020 showing that the net amount misreported was 55% where there was little or no information reporting (e.g., sole proprietor earnings or sale of business property), but that amount fell to 5% where third-party information reporting was required. As a result, when the IRS expressed concern that there was substantial nonreporting of cryptocurrency transactions, Congress responded by expanding information reporting to digital asset brokers.  Read more: Kirk Phillips - The IRS Is Making Crypto Compliance Impossible  The amendments made by the Infrastructure Act were effective for information returns filed after December 31, 2023, which means that brokers would have had to begin collecting information on January 1, 2023 for Forms 1099 required to be filed in early 2024. However, the proposed broker regulations were not issued until August 29, 2023, so the rules propose to delay information collection until January 1, 2025 for Forms 1099 to be filed in early 2026. The IRS has announced that it plans to issue a new form for this purpose, a Form 1099-DA (for digital assets).  Scope of digital asset broker  The proposed regulations introduce a new term, “digital asset middleman,” to refer to brokers that make sales of digital assets. The definition of this term is very broad and would include multiple brokers with respect to the same transaction. Specifically, the definition includes any person who provides a facilitative service with respect to a sale of digital assets, and the nature of the service arrangement is such that the person ordinarily would know or be in a position to know the identity of the customer and the nature of the transaction.  The proposed regulations further broaden this definition by providing that facilitative services include services that indirectly effectuate a sale of digital assets and persons are in a position to know the customer identity and nature of the transaction if they have the ability to change the fees charged for these services. For example, the proposed regulations would treat as reporting brokers:  digital asset trading platforms that provide custodial wallet services;  non-custodial digital asset trading platforms (including decentralized platforms that operate through smart contracts);  wallet providers that include software that allows users to directly access trading platforms;  digital asset payment processors;  operators and owners of digital asset kiosks; and  issuers who regularly offer to redeem digital assets (including stablecoin issuers).  Although the proposed regulations contain exceptions for validators (e.g., miners and stakers) and hardware and software wallet providers, these exceptions only apply if no other functions or services are provided. In addition, retailers who accept digital assets from a customer as payment for goods or services, and artists who create and sell NFTs representing interests in the artists’ work are also excluded.  Impact on customers  This broad definition would include multiple brokers for the same transaction. For example, if a user connects their self-hosted wallet to a DeFi platform and engages in a swap of tokens, then at a minimum the wallet provider and the DeFi platform could be digital asset middlemen. In addition, it is not clear whether ancillary participants, such as liquidity providers and holders of governance tokens controlling the DeFi platform, would also be digital asset middlemen.  The securities broker reporting rules contain a multiple broker rule, which exempts brokers who conduct sales on behalf of other brokers so that only the broker with the closest relationship to the customer is required to report. But the proposed regulations do not provide a similar rule for digital asset middlemen. As a result, each digital asset middleman involved in the sale of digital assets must send its own Form 1099-DA to the IRS and the taxpayer. This could create a lot of confusion for the taxpayer. Some taxpayers may just report the gain from each Form 1099-DA, which would result in over-taxation. Other taxpayers may try to reconcile all the Forms 1099-DA and report the transaction only once, which could trigger an IRS notification due to a mismatch between what was reported by the brokers and by the taxpayer. Either way, it would impose a burden on the taxpayers.  Impact on potential brokers  Before the proposed regulations were issued, some companies reasonably believed that they would not fall within the definition of digital asset broker, so these rules were not on their radar. Although many remain hopeful that Treasury and the IRS will scale back the definition of digital asset middleman in the final regulations, any scale-back will likely just be around the edges. As a result, businesses throughout the digital asset ecosystem will have to develop, test, and implement information collection and reporting systems.  If the proposed effective dates are retained in the final regulations, businesses will not have much time to do this. Most of the information required to be reported (e.g., customer data, name and number of units of digital assets sold, gross proceeds, transaction ID and wallet address) would need to be collected beginning in 2025, but presumably, no one will want to program their systems until the regulations are finalized. As of writing, more than 120,000comments had been filed in response to the proposed regulations. These will take some time for the government to review and consider, so it seems unlikely that Treasury and the IRS could issue final regulations before Spring or even Summer 2024. This seems like an enormous lift for companies that do not currently collect any customer data, as they do not have any of the required systems in place.  Conclusion  We believe that final regulations should address the two critical points to ensure that the Forms 1099-DA are useful: (1) a multiple broker rule to prevent multiple Forms 1099-DA for the same transaction; and (2) an extension of the effective date to give companies sufficient time to develop information reporting systems that are reliable and compliant.

Bitcoin HODLing Yawns For Growth With Lesser Supply On Wednesday, November 15, a crypto analyst known as Root took to his official X (formerly Twitter) handle to share valuable data concerning Bitcoin. A yearly BTC supply chart also accompanied the analyst’s X post. According to the analyst, a significant part of BTC’s total supply has been inactive for over a year. In addition, the inactive supply has recently reached an all-time high (ATH) of 69%. The analyst stated: 69%, an all-time high, of the #Bitcoin supply, hasn’t been active for over a year. Root stated. Related Reading: The Role of Bitcoin in the Future of Finance: Trends to Watch This supply for one year or more is only a portion of a bigger group known as long-term holders (LTHs). One of the two major groups of Bitcoin investors comprises these LTHs, while the other is known as short-term holders (STHs). Investors holding coins longer than five to six months are classified as long-term holders. Meanwhile, those who hold coins no more than this given time are classified as short-time holders. In addition, even among LTHs, those who have passed the one-year mark would be considered “reliable gems.” However, this variety currently comprises the majority of the asset’s supply. This seems to have also increased significantly lately, as the graph indicates. According to statistics, holders are less likely to switch their coins any time the longer they are kept inactive. Due to this, the LTHs tend to be the most devoted segment of the market during periods of Bitcoin’s upsides or downsides. Double Top Pattern Resurfaces Driving The Crypto To A Downward Trend BTC has recently formed a double top pattern close to the $38,000 level, causing the token’s drop. The price has since fallen below the 100 hourly Simple moving average and the $36,500 mark. However, it seems the bulls emerged at the $36,500 mark, giving the token momentum to sustain between $36,000 and $36,500. Following the formation of a low at $36,517, the price is currently correcting losses.

42409496,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHkOe,1700236800,Republic's Profit-Sharing Token on Avalanche Will Pay Investors VC Dividends,"Startup fintech Republic Crypto plans to host its soon-to-launch revenue-sharing tokenized security on the Avalanche blockchain, the company told CoinDesk Friday.  The asset, called R/Note, will be the vehicle through which Republic distributes stablecoin dividends to investors who bought a slice of the upside in the company's venture portfolio. Every time Republic exits a particularly successful investment it will send holders their pro rata share of up to 25% of the dividend pool.  Part of crypto's burgeoning ""real world asset"" (RWA) craze, R/Note is most definitely a security – a difference between it and the thousands of other crypto tokens that claim they are not. That's by design: It'll be paying dividends from the proceeds of equity sales, after all.  Tokenization – bringing traditional investments or RWAs such as bonds or private funds to blockchains in a token form – has become one of the hottest corners in crypto, as even global banks are testing this trillion-dollar opportunity.  This distinction means R/Note must follow stricter rules around who can own and trade it than most other blockchain-based tokens. Avalanche blockchain is best-suited for RWAs ""because it has innate features"" that other chains don't have, like the ability to set up controllable subnets, said Andrew Durgee, head of Republic Crypto.  Subnets are highly customizable side chains that can optimize for, among other things, the regulatory rules associated with being a digital security.  Other big names in the investing world have taken a similar interest in Avalanche. This week, J.P. Morgan said it tested a tokenized portfolio on a permissioned Avalanche subnet. Avalanche's [AVAX] token is higher by about 40% over the past week.  Beyond the choice of chain, Durgee said digital securities such as R/Note have a leg up on their off-chain counterparts. For example: quickly distributing the dividends from equity exits – its raison d etré.  ""It's nearly impossible for me to directly send you additional security in a regular form. But in a tokenized form I can send it to you immediately,"" he said.  Republic sold $30 million worth of R/Note in a recently closed public sale, according to Durgee. Once the asset is live on the Avalanche blockchain it plans to have a secondary market.

When the value of this metric is positive, it means the long investors are paying a premium to the short ones in order to hold onto their current positions. Such a trend implies the majority of the market holds a bullish sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin NVT Remains Bullish, All-Clear Signal For Rally? On the other hand, negative values imply a bearish mentality is the dominant force in the sector as the DOGE short traders are outweighing the longs at the moment. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Dogecoin Binance funding rate over the past month: The value of the metric appears to have been positive in recent days | Source: Santiment on X As displayed in the above graph, the Dogecoin funding rate on Binance has turned highly positive recently as the latest rise in the meme coin’s price has taken place. This implies that speculators have jumped onto the opportunity and are betting on the price rise to continue. Since the longs have started piling up in this latest futures mania, the asset has only continued to trend up, suggesting that the bets of these traders have paid off so far. However, if history is anything to go by, the market being heavily long dominated has generally not ended well for DOGE. From the chart, it’s visible that similar spikes in the Binance funding rate coincided with local tops in the cryptocurrency during the last few weeks. The reason why such a pattern may exist is that as the futures market accumulates long positions, the chances of a long squeeze taking place become significant. A “squeeze” refers to an event where a sudden swing in the price unleashes a cascade of liquidations on the sector. This cascade of liquidations only makes the swing sharper, thus extending the rally/crash (depending on which side of the market is taking the brunt). Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Exchange Inflows Hit $1.2 Billion In Past Month When longs are much more in number, such a waterfall of liquidations is naturally easier on their side as compared to the shorts. Thus, while Dogecoin is riding on some sharp momentum right now, any pullback might result in a long squeeze, which could lead to the asset registering a notable drawdown. DOGE Price Following the latest rally, Dogecoin has surged towards the $0.087 level for the first time since April.

The meme token has been giving traders mixed signals for the past month, but signs like on-chain transaction volume and DOGE’s mission to the moon are starting to point to the next surge being right around the corner. Despite the majority of cryptocurrencies being in the red over the past 24 hours as consolidation and modest selloffs continue, Doge has managed to post a gain of 6.87%. Dogecoin Transaction Volume Spikes Price activity indicates that Dogecoin has gained more than 10% over the course of the past week. The cryptocurrency struggled to post gains like other popular cryptocurrencies for the most part of October’s rally. Related Reading: Polygon Network Metrics Explode: Is It Time For MATIC Price To Reach $2? Price data from Coinmarketcap shows the crypto only spiked 19.7% from its October bottom of $0.0579 to end the month at $0.069. However, things changed in early November, as bulls and whales started to inject capital into the cryptocurrency. This influx pushed the cryptocurrency over the strong $0.76 support. According to crypto analyst Rekt Capital, this breakout was the beginning of a shift in trend, with a spike to a $0.15 price target now in formation. Various on-chain monitors reveal that on-chain transactions have spiked at the same time. According to on-chain analytics platform Santiment, Dogecoin reached a total transaction volume of $665 million yesterday, its highest level in three months. Data from Coinmarketcap also puts the total transaction volume in the past 24 hours at $1.83 billion, an increase of over 240% from the previous day. 🐶 #Dogecoin has had a modest +5% surge on a mostly flat #crypto market day. It has been aided by $665M in #onchain transaction volume, its highest level in 3 months. There is also a notable amount of $DOGE longs opening as traders bet on prices rising. https://t.co/uFgCCIxih0 pic.twitter.com/DussxIPJN2 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) November 16, 2023 Dogecoin millionaires figures are currently in decline, but that has not stopped whale activities as large transactions have spiked in the past week amid greater market pullback. IntoTheBlock’s large on-chain transaction metric shows that DOGE’s large on-chain transactions totaled $1.37 billion in the past 24 hours, a 69% increase from the prior day. Source: IntoTheBlock Most of this heightened trading activity can be linked to increasing enthusiasm within the Dogecoin community surrounding robotics company Astrobotic’s launch of a physical Dogecoin token to the moon in December. For a token whose price is mostly driven largely by hype and excitement, the anticipation and achievement of this Moon mission could very well start a sustained upward trend for Dogecoin.

42409490,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHl8w,1700228941,First Mover Americas: Avalanche and Near Lead Weekly Gains,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Avalanche’s AVAX token and Near Protocol’s NEAR have finished the week on top. AVAX gained almost 50% in the last seven days while NEAR added more than 18%. Some analysts are pointing to Avalanche's inclusion in the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) tokenization initiative, Project Guardian, earlier this week as a catalyst for the increase. The project includes the likes of Onyx by JPMorgan and Apollo Global. Meanwhile, NEAR likely drew strength from a series of developments announced last week at its annual Nearcon conference in Lisbon. Bitcoin lost ground on the week, dropping 3%, and ether fell 6%.  BlackRock (BLK), the world’s largest asset manager, filed an S-1 form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its iShares Ethereum Trust, a spot ether exchange-traded fund (ETF). This move follows last week's corporate registration of that name and Nasdaq's filing of a 19b-4 with the SEC seeking approval for the spot ETF. The price of ether (ETH) briefly jumped nearly 2% to $2,080 on the S-1 filing, but has since returned to roughly its price prior to the news.  Crypto asset manager CoinShares said it secured an exclusive option to buy the exchange-traded fund (ETF) unit of Valkyrie Investments, gaining a U.S. foothold amid speculation the Securities and Exchange Commission will soon approve a spot bitcoin ETF. The Saint Helier, Jersey-based company, whose shares trade on Nasdaq Stockholm, said the option expires March 31. CoinShares didn't disclose how much it paid for the option, or details of pricing for the acquisition, should it decide to go ahead. Spot crypto exchange-traded products are already available in Europe. That's not yet the case in the U.S., though speculation has swirled recently that one is coming – which could open up bitcoin investing to a broad range of people.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows that the number of blockchain addresses holding at least $1,000 worth of BTC, known to move in tandem with BTC's price, surged to a record high of 8,306,118 on Nov. 15, topping the previous peak registered two years ago.  Meanwhile, bitcoin's price is still 47% below the peak of $69,000 registered in November 2021.  Source: Glassnode  We may earn a commission from partner links.

20305095,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561176,1700226904,"Crypto Analyst: XRP Price Enters DCA Range, Suggests Buying Opportunity","The XRP price has entered what is regarded as the Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) ranging zone, according to crypto analyst Egrag. While the digital asset’s price oscillates within a critical zone, the analyst maintains a bullish stance on its future trajectory. XRP Price Enters DCA Zone Egrag stated via a post on X, “XRP Color Code (Update): My Stance Forged in the Fires of Conviction: Let me say it 1 million times that I’m still bullish AF, so ease up on the DMs assuming I’ve switched my stance. Remember, markets move in waves, and I’m here to present the short-term moves because, let’s face it, 80% want to reach Valhalla without dying.” The analyst’s latest technical analysis reveals that the previous support level at $0.66 proved to be weaker than anticipated, leading to a shift in the XRP price’s movement into a ranging zone. “$0.66 wasn’t a solid support, as I’ve mentioned before. XRP is in the ‘ranging’ zone, so the DCA opportunity is open,” Egrag stated. Related Reading: Ripple Introduces AMMs To XRPL, But Is This Good Or Bad For XRP Price The analyst’s chart exhibits a descending triangle pattern breaking downwards, indicating potential bearishness in the short term. However, Egrag highlights the importance of the $0.50 mark as a “robust support.” He asserts that the price “won’t dip below $0.50—it’s a pivotal price point.” The above 1-hour chart shows that the price has now been rejected several times at the falling (red) trend line. If this momentum is maintained, XRP could drop further and could find first support near $0.57. If this support also breaks, the $0.51 mark could be the most crucial turning point. For Egrag, the zone between $0.5738 and $0.5119 is the “wicking” zone, meaning that the price could swiftly dip into this zone. However, if the price drops below $0.5119, it would enter the “red flag” zone of Egrag’s chart, potentially invalidating the entire prediction. The Fibonacci retracement levels on Egrag’s 3-day chart suggest significant resistance and support zones. The 0.236 level at approximately $0.7409 and the 0.382 level at about $0.6432 may act as resistance in a bullish scenario, while the 0.5 level at $0.5738 and the 0.618 level at $0.5119 could provide support if bearish momentum continues. Related Reading: Wall Street Expert Predicts Ripple IPO Date Notably, Egrag’s commentary doesn’t shy away from conviction, “XRP is transforming the way value moves in this digital age. So, it’s crucial to understand what you hodl. Otherwise, I might have to break out the block button for those not willing to learn on how markets move and what XRP or XRPL is achieving. I’m staying true to my beliefs, and if that’s not your vibe, it’s cool to step away from following me.” Criticism For ‘Stubborn View’ Despite facing criticism from a user comparing the XRP price performance to that of other cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) and Chainlink (LINK), Egrag defended the long-term vision for XRP, highlighting its value proposition. He responded, “Appreciate your input, but I’m not pursuing 300% or 500% gains in projects I lack conviction in. My focus is on generational wealth. Imagine understanding gold will reach $2000, and having the chance to acquire it at $0.5.” The critic replied, “XRP holders are not diamond hands.. Just very stubborn people hoping to be able to sell it at the price they bought. Be happy if it reaches 1$ again.” Undeterred, Egrag concluded, “Indeed, TESLA investors weren’t stubborn; they envisioned the future. The same principle applies to FANGMAN companies. Bookmark this: XRP, the first digital asset with regulatory clarity, and anticipate Ripple, as a company, surpassing the collective value of the FANGMAN entities.” At press time, XRP traded at $0.6118.

20302282,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561156,1700221524,"Options Frenzy: Bitcoin Rally To $37,000 Sparks Explosive Open Interest Surge","An apparent increase in demand for safe-haven assets, rising interest in Bitcoin ETFs in the US, and anticipation of a more accommodating position from the Federal Reserve were the purported drivers of the cryptocurrency market’s recovery this year, which led to a significant gain in the value of Bitcoin. While the spot and futures markets for bitcoin were at the center of attention at first, options related to the cryptocurrency have recently come to the fore. By introducing a new facet to the market dynamics, these options give a convenient way to speculate on possible price swings. According to figures from Glassnode, the open interest in Bitcoin’s options has reached a new high point by exceeding $16 billion. This big increase in open interest happens at the same time that Bitcoin’s price successfully reclaimed the $37,000 mark on November 15. Options Open Interest On The Rise The rise in open interest for options shows that the market is more active and investors are interested in Bitcoin futures. The $16 billion figure shows how important options trading is becoming as a major part of the bitcoin market. On November 10, the Options Open Interest, a measure of the total amount of money invested in options contracts, reached a record high of $18.05 billion, or 491,000 Bitcoin, Coinglass data shows. Deribit, which has contributed about $14.5 billion, is mostly responsible for this surge, according to Coinglass. Related Reading: Litecoin Sustains 4-Month Run With 37% Gain, Beating Most Of Its Peers – Details The cryptocurrency derivatives exchange has also disclosed a nearly peak value of $14.6 billion for its entire open interest notional value. Source: Coinglass Bitcoin was trading at $36,550 at the time of publishing. Using statistics from CoinMarketCap, the last time BTC traded at the $37K price was in May 2022. The coin has gained 5% in value over the past day. In a noteworthy development, BTC options open interest has outpaced that of BTC futures, marking a significant stride in what Deribit described as “increasing market sophistication.” The platform reported this shift earlier in the week, with Deribit’s Chief Commercial Officer, Luuk Strijers, emphasizing that the surpassing of BTC options open interest over futures open interest serves as a clear indicator of the market’s maturation. BTCUSD trading a little over $36K today. Chart: TradingView.com Bitcoin And The Broader Shift In Market Dynamics According to Strijers, this transition suggests a growing inclination among participants to leverage options as strategic instruments for positioning, hedging, or capitalizing on the recent surge in implied volatility. This evolution underscores a “broader shift in market dynamics,” reflecting an enhanced understanding and utilization of financial instruments within the cryptocurrency space. Related Reading: Altcoin Delight: Solana Balloons To 50%, Nearly Triples In A Month – Here’s Why Meanwhile, adding to the upbeat narrative, the eagerly anticipated Bitcoin halving scheduled for April 2024 emerges as a beacon of positivity.

Analysts and enthusiasts alike are brimming with optimism, viewing the upcoming halving as a potential catalyst that could robustly reinforce Bitcoin’s position and intrinsic value within the market, paving the way for heightened anticipation and market dynamics.

""The difficult part is adoption,"" Ashok Venkateshwaran said on the sidelines of the Singapore FinTech festival on Wednesday. ""So if you have CBDCs in your wallet, you should have the ability for you to spend it anywhere you want – very similar to cash today.""  The payments giant has a CBDC Partner Program that includes participants such as Ripple, Fireblocks and Consensys. The move was designed to encourage conversations among key players in the industry, but was seen as a way for Mastercard (MA) to deepen its involvement with CBDC developments as the number of nations exploring the technology grows. As many as 130 countries, representing 98% of global gross domestic product, are exploring a CBDC, according to the Atlantic Council. In May 2020, only 35 countries were considering one. Still, only 11 countries have so far introduced a digital currency.  For the time being, it's hard to justify the effort, he said. Building the necessary infrastructure ""takes a lot of time and effort on a part of the country.""  Last week, Mastercard completed Hong Kong's CBDC Pilot focused on demonstrating how CBDCs or tokenized deposits can be used for real-world asset transactions. ""The pilot also showcased the potential for seamless funding and settlement in and out of Web3 marketplaces via a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC).""

An increase in leveraged bets came after a 12% surge on Thursday as one company said it planned to send a physical Dogecoin token to the moon.  However, a spike in DOGE prices could be considered a generally bearish indicator  A key metric of dogecoin [DOGE] futures jumped about 40% in the past 24 hours, an indication of higher risk-taking behaviors among traders and one that has historically marked local price tops in crypto markets.  Open interest, or the number of unsettled futures bets, spiked to more than 7 billion DOGE tokens on Friday, reaching levels previously seen in April. These positions are worth $600 million at current prices.  Nearly half of the bets, $275 million worth of futures positions, are placed on Binance, followed by Bybit at $134 million and OKX at $85 million. The longs-to-shorts ratio is 50% on either side, implying traders may have hedged all their bets.  Rising open interest usually signals a bullish bias among futures traders. However, if it grows too high or spikes suddenly, it can be a bearish signal that indicates a coming change in market trends as traders may be building short positions.  The increase in DOGE open interest is an outlier to the general market. Futures tracking major tokens, such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), saw a 5% drop.  DOGE prices jumped over 12% on Thursday amid reports of a space payload mission planned by Pittsburg-based firm Astrobotic to take a physical dogecoin token to Earth’s moon in a December mission.

42409488,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHl2K,1700216434,"Recent Altcoin Rally Powered by South Korean Traders, CryptoQuant Says","South Korean traders are known to drive speculative frenzies in smaller cryptocurrencies.  One such token rose as much as 6,600% in September before being listed on international exchanges.  However, bitcoin has remained king for the larger part since September, as its dominance over the overall market increased.  Part of the rapid surge in prices for alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) in the past few months may be traced back to South Korean traders, known for their high risk-taking behaviors that often spark speculative frenzies in tokens.  Spot volumes on local exchange Upbit have nearly doubled since September, analysts at on-chain data firm CryptoQuant shared in a Friday note to CoinDesk. Upbit, which constitutes over 85% of the Korean trading volume, experienced an 82% growth in October compared to September, with trading volume rising from $32.8 billion to $59.8 billion.  This possibly created a flywheel effect as rising volumes attracted market makers and traders, who, in turn, invested profits to continue buying in a rising market.  Notable booms include Loom Network’s LOOM, whose price surged approximately ten times over two months, and HIFI, whose prices spiked by 6,600% in September alone.  “For coins that are only listed on Korean exchanges, if there is a significant increase in trading volume, listing futures on them has been popular on overseas exchanges,” CryptoQuant's analyst Bradley Park told CoinDesk in a message. “From an on-chain perspective, market makers are the buying power.”  Park added that HIFI's reserves on Upbit rose Hifi reserves on Upbit rose 27.5% from 62 million tokens to 82.9 million tokens. It's a sign of South Korea playing a pivotal role in altcoin rallies, Park told CoinDesk.  The chart shows Upbit led the volume growth in LOOM markets as prices surge 238% in September and another 100% in early October before reversing gains in the later half of the month.  The major part of the rally in decentralized lending and borrowing platform HIFI happened before Binance launched perpetual futures tied to HIFI in mid-September. Post the launch, the token's price turned lower.  While altcoin activity has spiked on South Korean exchanges, bitcoin has maintained its dominant position worldwide.  Bitcoin's market dominance – a ratio of bitcoin’s capitalization compared to the rest of the market – rose to 53% from 49% in this period, suggesting the premier cryptocurrency remained the most favored bet among traders.  Overall market capitalization has risen to $1.4 trillion as of Friday from just over $1 trillion at the start of September, data shows.  10:30 UTC: Adds additional comments from CryptoQuant in the sixth para.",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | ASIA | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/17/recent-altcoin-rally-powered-by-south-korean-traders-cryptoquant-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bcc7259e9bd7c703b239d949221d9b9a66874c9c-4240x2832.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On Thursday, the Bitcoin BRC-20-inspired mint took place and the burn figures have been nothing short of impressive. Over 100 million MATIC tokens were incinerated as a result of this event. But data suggests that this rush is far from over. POLS Mint Triggers Massive MATIC Burns The POLS token mint saw a massive turnout from the Polygon community as thousands of investors clamored to mint their tokens. As a result, the fees on the network skyrocketed and the ensuing token burn crossed 100 million MATIC.

The NFT collection is rising in popularity and by Friday, a total of 10.32% of the collection has been minted. Why Polygon Is Just Starting One of the major drivers of the POLS popularity is its similarity to the BRC-20 standard that allowed for minting NFTs on the Bitcoin network which has been incredibly successful so far. Given the success of the BRC-20 tokens, this bullishness has translated to the PRC-20 tokens. With only 18,480 owners of the POLS tokens and over 400,000 daily users on the Polygon network, there is still a lot of room for the new Polygon standard to catch on. When this happens, the expectation is that more investors will get into the tokens. Related Reading: Ripple Introduces AMMs To XRPL, But Is This Good Or Bad For XRP Price Polygon users are also actively awaiting the rebranding of the MATIC tokens into the new POL token. This rebranding is expected to give the token a sort of ‘fresh start’ that could propel the price upward. Users will have to convert their MATIC tokens to POL. However, the team has said that holders will have up to four years to do this. The MATIC price initially benefitted from this surge in user activity by rising above the $0.94 level on Thursday. However, the altcoin has managed to lose some of those gains after falling 6.61% on Friday, according to data from Coinmarketcap.

42409491,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHlCF,1700214186,Here Are 3 Charts Supporting the Bull Case for Bitcoin,"The global central bank tightening cycle that rocked financial markets, including bitcoin, last year seems to have peaked.  U.S. financial conditions have eased despite the Fed's higher-for-longer interest-rate mantra.  The U.S. 10-year Treasury note looks set to extend its recent slide in a positive development for risk assets.  Bitcoin's [BTC] price has risen by 120% this year and most analysts foresee further gains in the near term. They point to expectations the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve one or more spot exchange-traded crypto funds (ETFs) soon and the halving of the Bitcoin blockchain's mining reward, which is due April next year.  The bullish case is also gaining support from the wider economy. The charts below show a positive turnaround in the macroeconomic factors that played a role in last year's price crash.  Global central bank policy cycle  The chart by TS Lombard shows the balance of central banks tightening versus those loosening since 1947. Positive values suggest a net bias for tighter monetary conditions, while negative values indicate a preference for easing.  A loose policy involves boosting liquidity, that is releasing more money into the financial system, through interest-rate cuts and other measures and spurs risk-taking, as observed in 18 months following the coronavirus crash of March 2020. A tighter monetary policy involves sucking liquidity out with interest-rate increases and other tools to tame inflation. It often disincentivizes risk-taking in financial markets, as seen last year.  The plot has recently turned lower, indicating that last year's global tightening cycle that rocked financial markets, including cryptocurrencies, has peaked, and there is now an increasing bias toward liquidity easing.  With inflation rates slowing worldwide, central banks have room to take their feet off the tightening pedal. The move away from tightening could lead to an increased inflow of money into the crypto market. Bitcoin is known to be extremely sensitive to changes in global liquidity conditions and tends to rally when there's more money around.  U.S. financial conditions ease  The chart below shows investment banking giant Goldman Sachs' U.S. Financial Conditions Index (FCI) since January.  The index has tanked from the year's high of 100.74, seen only a few weeks ago, to just under 100, undoing all the tightening witnessed in September and October.  The decline stands opposite the Federal Reserve's higher-for-longer interest-rate stance and hints at a resilient U.S. economy ahead, a positive development for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Most of bitcoin's year-to-date gains have occurred during the U.S. trading hours.  The FCI is a weighted average of short-term interest rates, long-term interest rates, the trade-weighted U.S. dollar exchange rate, an index of credit spreads, and the ratio of equity prices to the 10-year average of earnings per share.  A 1% fall (rise) in the index is known to bring about a 1% positive (negative) GDP impulse in the subsequent three to four quarters.  According to Fed analysts, financial conditions are a “constellation of asset prices and interest rates” that change based on economic health and monetary policy, and which can also potentially affect the economy itself.  Breakdown in the 10-year Treasury yield  Another positive development for bitcoin is the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note, which has declined by 50 basis points to 4.43% since the Treasury announced a slower pace of bond purchases at the beginning of the month. A decline in the 10-year yield, the so-called risk-free rate, often forces investors to seek higher returns through other assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies.  The 10-year yield could drop further, as the daily chart shows a bearish head-and-shoulders technical analysis pattern.  ""10-year yields delivered a lower high (as expected) and broke lower, clearing a head and shoulders top. The pattern yields a target of about 3.93%, but current levels (uptrend) and 4.33% (breakout point) are potential supports too,"" EFG Bank's research team said in a note to clients this week.  Potential risks  The reversal of tighter financial conditions signaled by Goldman's FCI index could introduce a more hawkish tone into Fed comments, forcing markets to reconsider the possibility of another rate hike in the coming months. That might slow down the pace of bitcoin's rally.  Bulls should also keep an eye on Japan's exit from ultra-easy monetary policy, geopolitical issues, U.S. commercial property concerns, and potential flare-up in inflation as sources of price volatility in risk assets.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/17/here-are-3-charts-supporting-the-bull-case-for-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f6eda54b455f218f8c5c4485d8092bbe56692002-1280x850.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

20296484,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561137,1700210154,Wall Street Expert Predicts Ripple IPO Date,"Wall Street financial expert Linda Jones recently offered a detailed forecast regarding the potential Initial Public Offering (IPO) of Ripple. Speaking at a Fireside chat with Linqto, a pre-IPO investment platform, Jones outlined her insights into the expected timeline and factors influencing Ripple’s decision to go public. Jones stated via X, “Here is my interview with Linqto today. We talked about when Ripple might go public, my back of the envelope calculation for what the stock might be worth and potential acquisition targets.” Ripple IPO In May 2024? Despite Ripple’s apparent lack of immediate need for IPO-related funds, Jones suggested that investor pressure might compel the company’s executives towards this path. She elaborated, “Well like I said, Ripple was founded in 2012, and I think their investors want the exit and Brad [Garlinghouse] will get pressure to do that even though they don’t need the money from the IPO.” Related Reading: Ripple Introduces AMMs To XRPL, But Is This Good Or Bad For XRP Price Her forecast hinges on a broader economic outlook, predicting a bull market spurred by decreasing inflation and interest rates, thereby creating a conducive environment for public offerings. “I do think we will go into this incredible bull market that will happen from the drop of inflation and interest rates that will lead to a very strong rise in stocks that will allow the IPO market to get very hot next year,” Jones added. Jones pinpointed mid-May 2024, specifically around May 15, as the ideal window for Ripple’s IPO, contingent on favorable market conditions and company readiness. “I think there is an opportunity if Ripple wants to go public next year that mid-May would be an ideal time, right around May 15 would be an ideal time – that’s my first target that they might go public if everything – the stars, the Sun, and the Moon – lined up, and they wanted to go public,” she explained. Related Reading: Ripple Vs. SEC: Epic Battle Unfolds Over $770M Disgorgement Demand However, she also cautioned about the uncertainty of this timeline, indicating that if Ripple misses this window, the next viable opportunity might not arise until 2025. “If it doesn’t happen, then I think it probably won’t happen until 2025,” Jones remarked. One Roadblock Remains To Be Removed Further complicating Ripple’s path to an IPO is the ongoing legal conflict with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has acknowledged this challenge, noting that SEC approval for Ripple’s Form S-1 Registration Statement is necessary for an IPO. As long as the legal battle persists, this approval remains uncertain. At press time, the XRP price traded at $0.6165 after dropping below the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level.

42409473,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHkEj,1700210095,Global Standards Setter for Securities Regulation Publishes Crypto Markets Policy Recommendations,"The International Organization of Securities Commissions, the global standards setter for securities markets regulation, denied crypto industry requests for a bespoke regime for stablecoins while agreeing to demands for greater accountability from so-called financial influencers.  The recommendations for regulating crypto, published Friday after a consultation period that started in May, are meant to help establish a coordinated global regulatory response to the risks posed by crypto asset service providers (CASPs) among the group's members. Those risks include market abuse, conflict of interest, client asset protection and disclosures, it said at the start of the process.  ""The activities of CASPs and their associated risks frequently mirror those observed in traditional financial markets,"" Tuang Lee Lim, chair of IOSCO's financial task force, said in a statement. ""The regulatory approach taken is therefore consistent with IOSCO’s principles and associated standards for securities markets regulation.""  Many respondents asked for greater accountability for financial influencers, the report said. In response, IOSCO said regulators should work with other relevant authorities to ensure crypto promotions accurately disclose the product and service provided along with the associated risks. CASPs should also disclose any commercial arrangements with people providing investment advice on crypto assets that trade on their platform.  Some respondents to the consultation, including the various blockchain industry associations, advocated for a bespoke regime for stablecoins, claiming the current requirements would be burdensome. IOSCO rejected that stance and reiterated that its rules will apply to stablecoins.  IOSCO is the international policy forum for securities regulators, and its members regulate more than 95% of the world's securities markets in some 130 jurisdictions.

Meanwhile, bitcoin was down 2.5% in the last 24 hours, trading below $36,500, while ether is down 3.3% and changing hands under $2,000.

Onyx is JP Morgan's blockchain-based fixed-income trading network.  These demonstrations showcase how tokenization and smart contracts can automate and enhance the efficiency and scalability of financial services, a priority for the Singaporean regulator's push towards utilizing blockchain for FinTech and not crypto.  Meanwhile, NEAR likely drew strength from a series of positive announcements during the Nearcon conference.  Elsewhere, the decline in market leaders saw sizeable liquidations of leveraged positions.

20284381,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561115,1700186405,"Ethereum Is No Longer A 20-100X Coin, But Panic Selling Is A Big Mistake","Ryan Sean Adams, a crypto investor and a vocal Ethereum supporter, notes that some ETH holders are panic selling and diversifying into layer-1 altcoins like Solana (SOL) or Cardano (ADA), primarily concerned that the coin may not outperform the market as it did in the last bull cycle when it soared to around $5,000. Ethereum Holders Selling For High-Performing Altcoins In an X post on November 16, Adams said price action, despite these actions, might rapidly change even if ETH is no longer a 20-100X coin in the eyes of venture capitalists. The investor compares the current trading atmosphere to 2020, months before the second most valuable coin turned higher, surging to record levels. Presently, Ethereum is trading below the $2,000 round number, pulling back from a recent higher but remaining within a bullish formation. Still, it appears the community is dissatisfied with this performance, especially with competitors, primarily SOL and ADA posting impressive gains. As of writing on November 16, SOL has not only reversed losses of November 2022 when FTX filed for bankruptcy in the United States but has comfortably surged past key resistance lines, registering new 2023 highs of around $67. To quantify, SOL is up by over 200%. At the same time, Cardano is firm, adding roughly 70% from October 2023 lows, looking at price action in the daily chart. By October, ADA had discouragingly sunk to as low as $0.25. However, the stellar recovery at the tail end of October sparked demand for the coin, driving it to present levels. Related Reading: Howling At The Moon: 23,000% Dogecoin Signal Reawakens Cardano has been slugging in recent months despite the continuous ecosystem developments, including the refinement of the network’s performance during the Basho stage. Several enhancements, including pipelining, have been introduced to make the network more scalable and secure. Still, this didn’t reflect in ADA’s price action until the recent spike in October. ETH Remains A “Fantastic Asset” For Retail Investors The difference in performance between Ethereum and competing altcoins, as price action reveals, could be due to project-related triggers but mainly the difference in market cap. Ethereum is the second most valuable project, only trailing Bitcoin, whose market cap is multiples higher than even the second largest smart contract platform by market cap, BNB Chain. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Tops 19-Month High: Historical Data Shows What To Expect Subsequently, this makes ETH less volatile, forcing supporters, as Adam notes, to divest into other more volatile coins. These competing layer-1 altcoins have registered triple-digit gains in the last month alone. Nonetheless, even with ETH only adding 30% in the same period, Adams argues that the coin is a “fantastic asset” from a risk-adjusted basis for the average retail investor.

However, the risks and custodial minefield of crypto ETFs shouldn't be underestimated. There's a NYSE-listed stock, which solves a key fundamental issue in crypto: custody. An equity operating under close regulation, which is liquid, easy to hold and will go lunar if Bitcoin does, is the smart way to play a Bitcoin vertical. The crypto crowd is hyperventilating, as is their wont, with the prospect of one and indeed several Bitcoin (BTC-USD) ETFs getting the green light soon. Even a skeptic like me, with doubts on the benign impact of institutions on assets lashed to their derivatives, can’t deny the clear, strong bullish trend this is creating. The recent breakout up from near-term highs continues to produce the sort of vertical price movement we have come to expect from BTC, one of the spiciest assets on the block. When news of BlackRock’s application for an Ethereum ETF broke, up went ETH in the same ballistic manner. While the cryptocurrency denizens search for the next crypto to get the ETF treatment, I remain looking not for tokens to pre-empt the long-promised takeoff to the moon of the whole crypto ecosystem, but for an analogue I can hold that won’t have to be secured by either a painful self-custody situation or an - almost as uncomfortable - third-party relationship with some nebulous corp, enmeshed in the sort of volatile emergent financial environment of shocks constantly featured in the blockchain media. What I need is an instrument with a pedigree, operating under close regulation, which is liquid, easy to handle and that will go lunar if Bitcoin etc go on the big ‘God candle.’ It is tough, but I think I’ve found what I’m looking for: it’s an equity. Hurrah! I don’t often write about single stocks because big trends are what I focus on; I let that pick out the stocks for me, which generally go into a portfolio where the win/lose ratio does the work rather than a single win from a great single stock selection. However, now and again, up pops something I want to hold because it ticks all the boxes, and it is too interesting not to write up. First, I do believe that in the long term, the crypto industry alongside its assets will be even bigger than it is today, probably much bigger. Blockchain and crypto is not going away. After the regulators have rounded up the cowboys what will remain is a landscape where blockchain and crypto is driving a wide range of revolutionary business, financial and economic systems. There is a core sensitivity however, something at the heart of all assets and a problem that to this day after the passage of history remains unsolved: security. For a hope at security, you need custody and custody is everywhere in finance. Custody is, for example, the fundamental reason banks even exist. Custody is what makes the bond and equity markets go round. Custody is one of those functions ‘pros’ obsess about, but many retail investors don’t even realize is a big deal. It is particularly a big issue in crypto because if you lose your crypto, through any of the multitude of ways available, it’s gone and gone for good. If you burn a British £20 note, you can take the ash to the Bank of England and they will replace it, but nope that’s not happening with your Bitcoin. So, a stock that can go vertical, alongside Bitcoin is the place for me. Stocks are very secure to hold. The stock in question is called Bakkt (BKKT). I actually bumped into them at this year’s Bitcoin show in Miami. They are not ‘Bored Ape’ types (I hope that doesn’t offend them). They are a spinout from ICE, the Intercontinental Exchange. The stock has had a hard time, but it has been jumping in the last couple of days because their latest quarterlies are out. This is where a lot of people will want all sorts of number crunching facts about income and revenue, P/L, ratios etc and I understand that want. While that is what I do myself in a large portfolio of value investments, for this kind of single stock, a single idea investment, I try to boil it down to a one floor elevator pitch. Crypto to the moon = NYSE-listed crypto institution to the moon. So, to annoy the outsourcers, the fundamentalist number crunchers some more, here is the chart. BKKT chart (ADVFN) Many will find this weird, but I love this chart. For a pink sheet stock this chart pattern is poison, but for a solid emergent business in a deeply out-of-fashion segment it is golden. The company is expecting to be EBITDA neutral by the end of 2024 but care not. If Bitcoin keeps on rallying BKKT will do likewise but quite likely with even more rocketry. If Bitcoin doesn’t do the crypto vertical thing, then it won’t.

Many crypto community members have expressed their concerns about the impacts of AMMs integrated into XRPL. Some members believe that the XRP price may be affected and cause the token to become stable. Other members have welcomed the announcement with enthusiasm, anticipating the positive effects the initiative would have on the Ripple ecosystem. An XRP community member and co-founder of Anodos Finance, Panos addressed concerns regarding the potential effect of AMMs on XRP’s price. He stated that AMMs could increase buying pressure and liquidity on XRP while also improving its efficiency and adoption. “XRPL AMM will potentially add buying pressure on XRP as a significant number is expected to be locked on the AMM, which will also increase the liquidity of XRP and will attract even more traders and will make XRP more efficient for more use cases,” Panos stated.

It will always remain the native coin of the XRP Ledger, a decentralized digital asset that anyone can trade freely. XRP can never become a stablecoin for that reason, it’s technically not possible and makes no sense whatsoever,” Panos stated.
