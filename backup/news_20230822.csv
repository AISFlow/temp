16407605,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548386,1692745210,"SHIB Burn Rate Jump 1,100% Amid Expectations Of Shibarium Relaunch","Off the back of the much-anticipated Shibarium launch, the SHIB burn rate has seen a tremendous rise. This surge in the burn rate comes despite the Layer 2 blockchain running into problems on the day of its launch last week, and still being in private mode. But while it could point to renewed vigor among the meme coin’s investors, something else seems to be driving this accelerated burn rate. SHIB Burn Rate Is Up 1,108% In One Day According to data from Shiba Inu burn tracking website Shibburn, there has been a remarkable increase in burn rate in the last 24 hours compared to the prior day. In total, there have been over 1.046 billion tokens burned, which translates to a 1,108.78% increase during this timeframe. Related Reading: AVAX Price Bucks Under The Pressure Of Upcoming $102 Million Token Unlock This is in stark contrast to the previous day’s figures which came out at around 100 million tokens burned. However, while the jump in burn rate is interesting, the address doing most of the SHIB burn is even more interesting. Looking at the burn addresses posted by Shibburn, one address keeps popping up and that is the 0x4be2 address. A quick look on-chain revealed that this address is actually the contract address for the MARSWAP (MSWAP) token. Burn rate up over 1,100% | Source: Shibburn This token seems to dedicate a portion of fees generated from transactions toward SHIB burn and as it gains popularity, the number of SHIB tokens being burned has jumped. So far, Marswap accounts for about 40% of burnt tokens. But a single address, 0xcf6d, which is the ShibaSwap LP Token (SSLP) contract address, burned 418,719,732 tokens in what has been the single largest burn event in the last day. Token price remains highly volatile | Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com How Is The Token Price Responding? Despite the marked increase in the SHIB burn rate, the price of the meme coin has not responded as positively as expected. The token price seems to be keeping in line with the general crypto market sentiment and continues to trade in the red. Related Reading: Bitcoin Liquidations Top $500 Million Amid $1 Billion Crypto Decimation Although there has been a small shift in the last hour at the time of this writing, with SHIB’s price moving up a meager 0.16%, its price is still taking losses of 1.48% on the daily chart. Even more concerning is its significant loss of 21.94% on the weekly chart. Given this trend, it is unlikely that SHIB will make a break from the market and rally. Rather, a recovery from here will follow a Bitcoin rise. However, one event that could trigger a recovery is the Shibarium relaunch. According to lead developer Shytoshi Kusama, the layer 2 network could be gearing up for a relaunch in the coming days.

16405668,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548384,1692741658,"99.5% Of AVAX Holders In Loss, As Avalanche Bears Thirst For More Blood","The Avalanche token (AVAX), like most other altcoins, felt the bearish impact of the general market downturn, which resulted in a billion-dollar liquidation in the crypto market. Historical price data, however, shows that AVAX has been experiencing selling pressure long before this recent market crash. As expected, the struggling price of the Avalanche token has also been reflected in the portfolio of the cryptocurrency’s investors, who seem to be drowning in losses at the moment. AVAX Holders In Profit Reach All-Time Low: IntoTheBlock On Tuesday, August 22, market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock revealed – via a post on X (formerly Twitter) – that the number of AVAX holders in profit is at an all-time low. According to IntoTheBlock data, approximately 99.5% of AVAX holders are at a loss. This metric implies that nearly all investors in this cryptocurrency bought at a higher price and are currently holding at a loss due to the sustained bearish trend. Related Reading: XRP About-Face Sparks Another Descent – What Lies Ahead? From a historical perspective, AVAX holders have witnessed similar levels of loss in the past, albeit not to this extent. The on-chain tracker reported that the number of AVAX holders in profit was almost as low in June and December 2022. It is worth noting that these losses are unrealized, and they only become real when the Avalanche tokens – being held – are traded off. Although a high number of crypto holders in loss is not exactly a positive signal, it can be an indication that investors are yet to lose faith in a token and may even be banking on a recovery. Avalanche Price Dips 17% In A Single Week As mentioned earlier, the AVAX price has been struggling long before the recent market downturn, down by 52% from its yearly high of 21.37%. Unfortunately, the Avalanche market has been in a steep decline since notching a swing high in April. In the past week, which coincided with the $1-billion market liquidation, AVAX has lost more than 17% of its value. Furthermore, a broader look at the market data shows that the token is on a nearly 25% decline in the last 30 days. Related Reading: XRP Price Shows Confluence Of Bearish Factors and Could Decline Again The future doesn’t look particularly bright for AVAX, especially with its upcoming token unlock event. A total of 9.54 million tokens is set to be unlocked on August 26, with a large portion of the unlocked tokens expected to hit the open market, potentially exacerbating the struggles of the Avalanche price. According to CoinGecko data, AVAX is currently valued at $10.20, registering a 3.5% price decline in the past 24 hours. With a market cap of roughly $3.52 billion, the Avalanche token ranks as the 22nd-largest cryptocurrency in the market.

Crypto lawyer John Deaton explained this in an X (formerly known as Twiter) post uploaded earlier today, shedding light on the ramifications of the SEC’s lawsuit on XRP’s potential adoption in the US. You could NEVER underestimate the damage the SEC’s lawsuit has caused – NOT ONLY AGAINST RIPPLE – BUT #XRP. THREE YEARS OF ADOPTION – that’s what it’s caused. Just how long is 3 yrs – in crypto years? People seem to forget how much Coinbase promoted #XRP before the lawsuit.… https://t.co/1fZ3r8WCSd pic.twitter.com/GLu4kFUU38 — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) August 22, 2023 The comments come when discussions about regulatory clarity in crypto are more intense than ever, with token holders striving for clearer guidelines in the North American country. Related Reading: XRP About-Face Sparks Another Descent – What Lies Ahead? The Coinbase Connection According to Deaton, Coinbase, one of the pioneering cryptocurrency exchanges in the US, was at the forefront of promoting XRP before regulatory challenges arose. Deaton pointed out that before listing XRP, Coinbase proactively reached out to the SEC for clarity. In a meeting held in January 2019, Coinbase presented its regulatory framework for evaluating digital assets – a framework that had previously garnered admiration from senior SEC staff. With no objections raised by the SEC, Coinbase proceeded to list XRP the following month. In fact, in January 2019 Coinbase asked for and got a meeting with the @SECGov to SPECIFICALLY DISCUSS THE REGULATORY STATUS OF #XRP! Coinbase explained to the SEC that Coinbase had evaluated #XRP and ran it through Coinbase’s stringent regulatory framework for digital assets. — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) August 22, 2023 Furthermore, the fact wasn’t just restricted to Coinbase. Payment processing giant MoneyGram, which had established a partnership with Ripple for remittances, disclosed its intentions to integrate with the XRP Ledger through a formal filing with the SEC. Much like the Coinbase instance, MoneyGram didn’t receive any complaint from the regulatory body either, but the ensuing legal battle halted the company’s plans. The Controversial Lawsuit And Its Implications For XRP Contrary to these initial interactions, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020. Deaton emphasized that several industry stakeholders, including the lawyers at MoneyGram and Coinbase, assessed XRP and determined it was not a security. Yet, the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple painted a contrasting narrative. Amazingly, despite all the above (and so much more), on December 22, 2020, less than 2 years AFTER Coinbase met with the SEC about #XRP, and 18 months AFTER MoneyGram disclosed to the SEC it was utilizing #XRP, and despite lawyers at the SEC not concluding #XRP was a security in… — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) August 22, 2023 The following legal battle created was felt across the crypto industry. It raised questions about the regulatory landscape and brought forth discussions about the nature of cryptocurrencies and how they are classified in the US. While Ripple has seen commendable success outside the US, Deaton underscored that the lawsuit undeniably hindered XRP’s adoption within the country. Related Reading: XRP Price Shows Confluence Of Bearish Factors and Could Decline Again From Deaton’s perspective, the evidence gathered over the past three years suggested that the lawsuit may have been part of a strategy. While it remains speculative to conclude the exact motivations behind the SEC’s actions, the impact on XRP’s US adoption and the broader crypto market has been palpable. Deaton concluded: It is so clear the lawsuit was used as a weapon. I said it only 9 days after the Ripple lawsuit in a federal pleading, when I filed the Writ of Mandamus against the SEC, and all the evidence uncovered during the last 3 years proves it to be true.

Chastain, 33, was convicted of fraud and money laundering in federal court in New York in May. The conviction marked the end to what prosecutors called the first prominent NFT insider trading case. Chastain reaped more than $50,000 by buying and selling at least 45 NFTs he knew would be featured on OpenSea's homepage, concealing his purchases using various anonymous wallets and OpenSea accounts, according to the U.S. Justice Department.  Inner City Press first reported the sentencing Tuesday.  Chastain's sentence is a fraction of the roughly two year sentence prosecutors, who cited a previous insider trading case at Coinbase, had called for. The case's judge attributed the lenient sentence to Chastain's modest earnings from the trades.  At the time of the crime, the NFT market had reached its zenith, growing to roughly $40 billion.  ""Today’s sentence should serve as a warning to other corporate insiders that insider trading – in any marketplace – will not be tolerated, ” U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement on Monday.  According to the DOJ, Chastain will face another three months of home confinement and three years of supervised release after his prison term.

16401409,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548431,1692734419,Will Bitcoin Show A Repeat Of The March Rebound?,"Will Bitcoin observe a repeat of the rebound that took place after the crash back in March? Here’s what this on-chain metric suggests. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder SOPR Is Showing A Pattern Similar To March As an analyst in a CryptoQuant post explained, if the BTC short-term holder SOPR crosses above 1 in the coming days, a rebound might occur. The “Spent Output Profit Ratio” (SOPR) here refers to an indicator that tells us whether the investors are selling their Bitcoin at a profit or a loss right now. When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means that the average holder is currently moving their coins at a profit. On the other hand, values under this threshold imply that loss-taking is the dominant behavior in the market. The SOPR being precisely equal to one naturally suggests that the investors are just breaking-even on their selling currently, as the total amount of profits realized in the market is precisely canceling out the losses. In the context of the current discussion, the SOPR for only a specific market segment is of interest. Namely, the short-term holder (STH) SOPR is the relevant metric. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day simple moving average (SMA) Bitcoin STH SOPR over the past few months: Looks like the 7-day SMA value of the metric has been below the 1 mark in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant The STH group includes investors who purchased their BTC less than 155 days ago. This cohort makes up one of the two main segments of the market, the other side being the “long-term holders” (LTHs). As displayed in the graph, the 7-day Bitcoin STH SOPR had been floating around the neutral mark before the recent crash, but following it, the metric has plunged into the loss territory. This would suggest that the STHs have been panic-selling at a loss after they witnessed the cryptocurrency register a deep drawdown. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dip Worth Buying? What Market Sentiment Suggests The chart shows that the crash back in March of this year also pushed the STHs into selling at a loss. The lowest value that the 7-day STH SOPR has seen in the current crash so far has been similar to what the March crash observed. Historically, capitulation has allowed the asset to form bottoms, as in such events, the weak hands exit the market, and the more persistent investors may pick up their coins. This effect seems to have worked in March, as the coin hit its bottom during the STHs’ capitulation. As the loss selling slowed down, Bitcoin rebounded in speculator fashion, as its price jumped below $20,000 to near the $30,000 mark. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Retest $20,500 Again? This Pattern May Suggest So Currently, the STHs’ loss selling is slowing down, as the metric’s value is gradually rising. The latest capitulation may have also allowed BTC to form a bottom this time. It remains to be seen whether that was the case, and if Bitcoin can show a rebound similar to back in March.

42409860,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQCgN,1692731685,Binance Needs to Get Off Twitter,"You’d think Binance has enough going on that it’d avoid problems of its own doing. Like mistakenly announcing on social media that euro transactions are no longer available. And yet, on Monday, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange caused a bit of chaos after just such a corporate communications flub.  To clear everything up: no, Binance did not lose the ability to transact in Europe. Paysafe Payment Solutions, Binance’s banking partner in the area, confirmed that withdraws and deposits conducted in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) will be available until Sept. 25, the original date it gave after announcing in June it would drop the global exchange as a customer following a “strategic review.”  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The bank was mopping up Binance’s mess, and may now feel even more justified in leaving Binance high and dry. Mistakes happen – X (RIP Twitter) is basically only interesting because people say regrettable things everyday – though this particular misstatement likely couldn’t come at a more inopportune time for Binance.  Binance, although it retracted its statement, essentially said what it expects will happen when Paysafe pulls the plug: “At the moment, we don’t have a time frame for the restoration of SEPA transfers.” Sure, sure this is all speculation, but that is awfully official language for someone with access to the social media accounts to have teed up.  As far as the world knows, Binance does not yet have a replacement for Paysafe. But given that the exchange is having trouble in the U.K., faces an investigation in France and essentially is not welcome in the Netherlands, Germany and Cyprus, its potential alternatives are likely to be hesitant to link up with the exchange.  See also: Binance Under Investigation in France for 'Aggravated' Money Laundering  I mean, you know things are going wrong when you’re having financial issues in Cyprus, a nexus of European tax-dodging and financial opacity. This is to say nothing of Binance’s legal trouble across the Atlantic, where it faces separate lawsuits from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and is apparently only being saved from criminal money laundering charges from the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) apparent concern over tanking crypto markets. (Alas for Razzlekhan, the mover of asses and markets.)  I’ve already written that I think Binance will make it through the mess, but I don’t bemoan other people’s fear, uncertainty and doubt, or FUD, to steal a phrase from the exchange’s founding chief executive Changpeng Zhao. In fact, CZ routinely tells his audience to simply ignore FUD. So much so that the billionaire entrepreneur has a catchphrase for when corporate challenges arise: often sending out just the number “4.”  See also: How Bad Is the Binance Suit? | Opinion  That bit of phraseology is, let’s say, enigmatic. As the Binance blog puts it when documenting the lineage of 4:  “Following a volatile year in the crypto markets, CZ wrote a post on Twitter on the second day of the year explaining that he would try to keep 2023 simple and spend more time on fewer things. After listing three ‘do’s’, including education, compliance, product & service, he added a number 4 of one ‘don’t’, which was to ‘Ignore FUD, fake news, attacks, etc.‘”  If you’re keeping count at home, that's three do’s. Do education. Do compliance. Do product and do service, which are obviously integrated. And one don’t. Don’t fear. Don’t uncertainty. And don’t even think about doubt. Now, I’m no math wiz but where I start to lose the scent is at “etc.,” which to my mind opens the door to other don’ts — maybe even an infinite amount of things to avoid or push out of mind.  Of course this could all be more arthimancy than arithmetic, if you catch my drift. Not exactly straight numerology (“translate the alphabet to numbers and then count the first letter of each Do and subtract the total numerical representation of FUD and you’ll peer into the mind of God and/or Gary Gensler”), but bit of New Age thinking for the Crypto Age, where all problems past, present and future are insurmountable if you just think affirmatively and ignore the negatives.  Doesn’t crypto deserve better than the Power of Positive Thinking when facing a near constant stream of PR nightmare fuel?  Binance CEO CZ, like many leaders in the space, was once praised for his authenticity — a willingness to give people a direct line to his thinking on social media and in interviews. But there’s a time and place for everything. Sam Bankman-Fried, also once active on Twitter, learned this the hard way when realizing his old schtick of lying through his teeth and saying “all the right shibboleths” wouldn’t bring back FTX. (Though I might be giving SBF too much credit there, the wisdom probably came from his lawyers.)  With all due credit, in the past year Binance has completely changed its communications policy from essentially “we don’t bow before statist pigs” to full-on obsequiousness. It is now simply reaping what it sowed in trying to work with regulators it formerly blew off. And Binance execs like Chief Compliance Officer Noah Perlman and general counsel Eleanor Hughes have impossible jobs, but are trying to thread the needle.  But not everyone is willing to forgive innocent mistakes or just blow past credible accusations of serious financial crimes at Binance. But it’s sad to see that Binance, which is still perhaps the most important single enterprise in crypto, hasn’t yet figured out how to deal properly. Yes, mistakes happen. Yes, it’s difficult to please both crypto’s degens while also appearing professional. Yes, crypto’s unrelenting defiance and ability to roll with the punches is its enduring strength.  But we need to know whether CZ is staying or going as chief executive, we need to know if the business will ever have an official home and we need to know what is actually going on in Europe. Many of these things may not have official answers, yet – but until they do, Binance is only FUDing itself.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | BNB,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/08/22/binance-needs-to-get-off-twitter,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8244fca4b937a852cad5d05e65743bbac57beae4-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Since hitting the $1.31 price mark, Optimism has embarked on an upward curve, looking set to return to the high price levels seen at the start of August. Optimism Major Investors Boost Holdings By 300% In The Last Year Among many positives for Optimism, the on-chain analytics firm, Santiment has also revealed another significant development for the altcoin in terms of investors’ interest. Related Reading: Optimism (OP) Rides The Wave Of Today’s Crypto Surge With 15% Rally According to a report by Santiment on August 21, whale and shark addresses on Optimism holding between 100,000-10,000,000 OP have consistently increased their amount of holdings over the last 12 months. The analytics team reported that these investors currently hold 505.91 million OP worth around $781.9 million. Remarkably, this stake constitutes a significant 69.6% of Optimism’s total market shares. In addition to this investment growth, Santiment also noted that Optimism recorded 22,900 active addresses on Monday, its fifth-highest value of their metric in 2023. Behind the Growing OP Accumulation Trend In line with Santiment’s report on the increasing OP accumulation by Optimism major investors, Spot On Chain, another blockchain analytics platform, has recently provided a deeper insight into this trend. According to a blog post by Spot On Chain, address 0x011, which they suspect belongs to popular venture capital firm Amber Group, has purchased 3.73 million OP – valued at $5.71 million – from Binance in the last 24 hours. The analytics team states that this particular address has accumulated 8.14 million OP, valued at $12.7 million over the last 19 days. Interestingly, Spot On Chain proposes that the reason behind OP’s recent accumulation could be the upcoming Ethereum Cancun/Deneb upgrade. Related Reading: Altcoin Season In Limbo As Bitcoin Dominance Bounces Off Key Support In June, Christine Kim, vice president of Galaxy Digital’s research team, stated that this impending Ethereum network upgrade – slated for the second half of 2023 – could boost the network capacity of layer two solutions such as Arbitrum and Optimism by 100-fold. At the time of writing, Optimism is trading at $1.56, with a 0.29% decline in the last hour. Albeit, the token’s trading volume is up 54.83% in the last 24 hours and is valued at $137.08 million.

They’re listening in a big way: “People are withdrawing fast,” said Xeonus, a pseudonymous contributor. The protocol’s TVL dropped nearly $100 million Tuesday amid the withdrawal rush.  Balancer, which supports trading of ether and other tokens with user-contributed liquidity pools instead of with traditional market makers, learned on Tuesday of a bug in its high-interest-paying boosted pools.  The disclosure sent the decentralized protocol – it is governed by BAL token holders – into lockdown; Balancer’s crisis response group activated and hit pause on many pools to prevent their draining. But “there are some pools that could not be ‘paused’ and are therefore at high risk,” that Xeonus said must be secured through user withdrawals.  Balancer’s latest estimate indicates 1.4% of total value locked – roughly $10 million – remains at risk.  The bug itself hasn’t yet been made public but project contributors expect to release a post mortem once things subside. They’ve already secured at least 80% of assets through the emergency actions.  Investors in BAL were spooked despite the orderly chaos.

Mounting legal and regulatory scrutiny over the exchange and a large distressed BNB-secured loan has weighed on the token’s price.  Some observers allege that Binance might be selling bitcoin to keep BNB price afloat.  BNB, a cryptocurrency closely linked to crypto exchange Binance, fell to its lowest in more than a year following a news report regarding fresh risks over Russia sanctions added to already mounting regulatory and legal pressure on the company.  The token sank to as low as $204 earlier Tuesday afternoon, its weakest level since June 2022's crypto market crash. It's since pared some of those losses, currently changing hands at $205, down about 14% over the past week.  This latest decline happened after the Wall Street Journal reported that Binance was facilitating Russian users' ability to move money abroad despite widespread international sanctions.  The exchange was already facing sprawling regulatory scrutiny around the globe, including a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for multiple federal securities laws violations such as commingling customer funds and listing unregistered securities like BNB and Binance USD on the platform.  Risks around Binance weigh heavily on BNB, which is the fourth largest cryptocurrency with $32 billion market value and powers the BNB Chain network, formerly known as Binance Smart Chain.  Is Binance selling bitcoin (BTC) to support BNB price?  Further price declines could potentially impact the broader crypto markets, as some market observers have long alleged that Binance might attempt to prop up the token’s value by selling bitcoin (BTC). The exchange’s CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has previously denied such rumors.  Alongside BNB's drop this afternoon, the price of bitcoin (BTC) also declined to session lows below $25,800.  A looming liquidation of a crypto loan secured by $130 million worth of BNB on decentralized finance protocol Venus also adds pressure to the token’s price. BNB Chain is coordinating with Venus to dismantle the loan in an orderly fashion to avoid “cascading liquidation” and “unnecessary damage to the market,” according to a Venus governance vote.  The BNB Chain developer team liquidated a $30 million chunk of the outstanding debt on Monday, which somewhat helped ease liquidation risks, CoinDesk reported.

This reversal, known as a V-top, has raised significant concerns within the crypto community and the trading floors. But what exactly does this term mean, and what implications does it hold for SHIB investors and enthusiasts? A V-top reversal is a distinctive price pattern observed in technical analysis. It occurs when a cryptocurrency’s value experiences a rapid ascent to a peak, followed by an equally swift decline. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) At June Lows Again – Prospects For Bullish Recovery? In SHIB’s case, this sharp reversal saw its value plummet from $0.00001136, a striking deviation from its recent surge. This downward spiral has caused the current price to stand at $0.00000789 according to CoinGecko data, reflecting a 4.5% drop within 24 hours and a staggering 23.1% slump over the past seven days. Shiba Inu: The Intersection Of FUD And Network Activity The timing of this massive price slump coincides with a period of uncertainty and anxiety within the SHIB community, centered around the Shibarium Layer 2 launch. The emergence of fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) has cast shadows over the project, leading to heightened caution among SHIB holders. Similar to Polygon, Ethereum, and other blockchains, Shibarium is open for anyone to build on. Regrettably, this also provides an avenue for bad actors to develop scam dApps and rug-pull tokens, among other things.

As a result of these apprehensions, SHIB holders have noticeably scaled back their transactional engagement over the past week. A closer look at CryptoQuant data highlights a stark contrast: on August 12, the SHIB Transaction Count exceeded 16,500, pushing the price to a four-month peak. Source: CryptoQuant However, this number dropped drastically to a mere 5,601 transactions on August 21, signifying a substantial 66% decline in network activity. This trend has been fueled not only by Shibarium FUD but also by the broader downtrend sweeping through the crypto market. Related Reading: XRP About-Face Sparks Another Descent – What Lies Ahead? Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at $0.00000795. Chart: TradingView.com A Glimpse At SHIB Demand And Potential Recovery Meanwhile, recent trading data from multiple cryptocurrency exchanges indicates that Shiba Inu enthusiasts are actively placing purchase orders, indicating their optimism for a positive market shift. This reflects their confidence in a potential bullish reversal and their active engagement in shaping Shiba Inu’s future. Source: IntoTheBlock Optimistic investors have initiated live purchase requests for nearly 2 trillion SHIB tokens, marking a rise of 400 billion compared to the 1.5 trillion SHIB orders registered the previous week. In contrast, the quantity of sell orders has maintained its position at 1.2 trillion SHIB tokens, showing little movement. Related Reading: XRP About-Face Sparks Another Descent – What Lies Ahead? This intriguing observation suggests that, despite prevailing uncertainties, market demand for SHIB remains strong, as investors potentially await the clearance of FUD clouds. Looking ahead, the resolution of challenges surrounding the Shibarium L2 network could pave the way for SHIB to regain momentum and reclaim the $0.000011 threshold.

While emergency measures have been implemented successfully to safeguard a significant portion of Total Value Locked (TVL), a portion of funds remains at risk. As a precautionary measure, Balancer Labs advises users to withdraw their affected Liquidity Provider (LP) funds without delay. It is important to note that, at present, no funds have been lost, and the vulnerability has not been exploited. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Community Leaves Shibarium Launch Troubles Behind As Wallet Count Crossed 10 Million Balancer Discovers Critical Vulnerability According to the announcement, Balancer Labs promptly executed emergency mitigation procedures upon receiving the critical vulnerability report, successfully protecting over 80% of the affected pools. However, approximately 4% of Balancer’s TVL is still exposed to risk. Balancer has received a critical vulnerability report affecting several V2 Pools. Emergency mitigation procedures have been executed to secure a majority of TVL, but some funds remain at risk. Users are advised to withdraw affected LPs immediately.https://t.co/PDzX32gqeS pic.twitter.com/F1f649Wz3L — Balancer (@Balancer) August 22, 2023 To address this, the Emergency SubDAO 60 swiftly enacted measures to facilitate proportional exits from all impacted pools and implemented a pause on pools that remain within the designated pause window. While the funds within the mitigated pools (designated as “mitigated”) are believed to be secure, Balancer Labs advises liquidity providers’ users to migrate their holdings to safe pools or initiate immediate withdrawals. Pools that could not be fully mitigated are labeled as “at risk,” and LPs who are currently part of these affected pools are urged to exit promptly to ensure the safety of their funds. Furthermore, Balancer Labs has provided a personalized page on their user interface (UI) to assist users in identifying if their connected wallet is associated with any impacted pools. A streamlined withdrawal process has also been established to guide users through the necessary steps. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dip Worth Buying? What Market Sentiment Suggests Ultimately, Balancer Labs plans to publish a comprehensive post-mortem report, detailing the nature of the vulnerability and the steps taken to address it effectively, aiming to provide users with a clear understanding of the incident and the subsequent mitigation efforts.

42409880,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQDTy,1692720714,"Meet Botto, the AI-Artist That Mints Its Own NFTs","To a casual observer, creating AI-generated art is comically easy. You just use a tool like Midjourney and type in some text, such as “The Beatles playing tennis at the North Pole, in the style of Rembrandt.” Seconds later, voila, art. Or, if not quite “art,” at least something that looks like it took a bit of effort. More than 15 million users of Midjourney alone are cranking out these mediocre bits of AI art.  Then there’s the work of “Botto.” This is a different beast. Created by German artist Mario Klingemann, Botto isn’t just an AI tool. It’s part AI, part human community, part DAO, and part early experimentation on the journey towards artistic AGI, and even self-awareness.  Botto isn’t a static AI tool. It’s learning. It’s evolving. Every week, Botto cranks out artwork and the community votes on the best pieces. The winners get minted as NFTs and are then sold on OpenSea. Sometimes the art is dark and unsettling, like this mushy soup of human eyeballs (currently selling for 25ETH, or around $47,000). Sometimes the art is pleasing to the eye, like this silhouette of a woman staring at a mysteriously illuminated sky. And sometimes the art is listed at Christie’s, giving it the imprimatur of the mainstream art world.  The question “What counts as art?” has animated the art world for centuries. As AI infiltrates every nook of human creativity, that question looms ever larger. So is Botto creating “real” art?  “The short answer is, yes, I think what Botto is creating is very similar to how humans create,” says Klingemann, 53, who has been at the forefront of machine learning and generative art for over fifteen years, long before it was fashionable. (His exhibitions CV stretches back longer than many AI/Web3 artists have been alive.) “There’s a notion that when we create something, we kind of build it out of thin air, and then it’s an idea,” says Klingemann, who speaks quickly and with nervous excitement. “But for me, creation is really more like discovery in the possibility space.”  And perhaps the very creation of Botto -- the ingenious system of a machine training itself to become a better artist -- is itself the work of art. On a Zoom call from his native Munich, Klingemann shares his journey into AI and generative art, his vision for how the space will evolve, and how he thinks about the paradox, “Everybody’s an artist, but if everybody’s an artist, then in a way, nobody is anymore, right?”  This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  When did you first get into AI art?  Mario Klingemann: Back in the '80s, I came across this book by Marvin Minsky, “The Society of Mind.” It was this theoretical book about how AI could work. And I said, wow, this is the future. This is amazing. But of course, at that time, it was just nice theoretical thinking but nothing you could use.  When did it become useful?  Around 2006 or 2007, I started thinking about creating generative art that’s more autonomous, so that it could evolve. It would be able to judge its own output.  How did that work exactly?  My first project that went in that direction was called “Sketch Maker,” as in the blind sketch maker. It was like a crazy Photoshop, where it had all these modules that were generating and transforming stuff. You could say, “Okay, here is a generator that makes random circles.” And you can put in several numbers, and then it creates 10 or 100 circles and then it can distribute them, and then it could use a blur filter or whatever. There were 70 or 80 different modules of these different functions.  Then what the tool did, just like Legos, was plugging them randomly together. It would produce something and then transform it, but totally randomly.  Then I thought, okay, how do I make the machine come up with something interesting? For most of this stuff, when you plug in this randomness, either it’s nothing or it looks like total crap. How can I build a tool that looks at the output, and kind of measures it in a way? Then I could train it to say, this is bad and this is good.  So I had this little model. How can I make a machine look at something and get valuable information? You could say those were my beginnings of machine learning.  It’s wild how early you were. How did you pull this off, since this was before the era of proper neural networks?  It was all statistics and about analyzing various histograms and other metrics. The results were actually quite interesting, and you could say that, in a way, everything that followed was just an improvement or a variation on this concept.  You have something that generates a big range of possibilities. Then it also works as the critic or the curator, and looks at what the generator has done, and it makes an aesthetic judgment based on certain parameters. Then it feeds that information back to the generator. Then hopefully the generator gets better.  This sounds like the core principle of Botto, too. Is it fair to say that with Botto, at a high level, you created a machine that could generate art on its own, then judge the quality of that art, and then, when it deems the art sufficiently good, bring it to market, automatically mint an NFT, and make money?  There's one element missing, but generally, that's the theory. Yes.  What’s the missing element?  How does it figure out what's good art, or what it could potentially sell? That’s where the human community, the DAO, comes into play. Before Botto goes to market, it gives Botto feedback on its proposals. You have these weekly votes where everybody who wants to participate gets to look at what Botto has produced. They put positive or negative votes on what we call “fragments.” At the end of the week, the one fragment that gets the most votes is minted, and hopefully sold.  At the same time, the voting information goes back to the AI, which tries to learn from that.  How does it figure out what's good art? That’s where the human community, the DAO, comes into play  How many fragments does Botto produce each week?  Maybe 10,000 or 20,000 fragments. But it never shows everything it produced. It makes a selection of 350 fragments of everything it has created so far. And that gets presented to the humans. And its “taste model” is trained by the votes. So Botto is currently sitting on a pile of, I don’t know, maybe 1.2 million fragments it produced. No human has ever seen them. I could go to the server and look at them, but that’s kind of not the point.  How does the “Botto coin” fit into this?  It’s the way you join the DAO. You acquire some Botto, you stake it, and that gives you voting points.  Tell me about Botto’s “periods”?  The first period [or era] was called Genesis, and that lasted a whole year. We weren't quite sure how quickly the technology would evolve. The idea of a period is that when a new period starts, Botto is allowed to upgrade itself and add new capabilities, new models, etc. So, after the Genesis period was over, we could finally allow Botto to use one of the new diffusion models, which just came into the world. This created much more astonishing results. And after the Genesis period [which lasted 12 months], we made the periods shorter, to 12 weeks.  To match the quickening pace of AI development?  Yeah, exactly. AI moves so fast that the DAO has to react faster. Since we started the new periods with the new models, every single fragment that Botto has created [and the community voted on] has sold as an NFT.  There’s one thing I’m super curious about. If the community is constantly giving Botto feedback, and Botto adapts to that feedback, is there a risk that the art becomes more safe, more tame, more recursive? Is its scope narrowing?  In other words, a human artist might travel to Kenya or something and get a jolt of inspiration, and the art would evolve in surprising ways. If it’s just responding to feedback, how does Botto find that same kind of creative spark?  At the core of the creation algorithm, I identified exactly that problem. Which is why Botto prompts itself in a very, very random fashion. And that's where these millions of fragments come into play. It's more like a discovery process. Botto might have created a lot of stuff that is brilliant, but the community hasn't seen it yet. Or what's more likely is that it also created a lot of very mediocre bad stuff.  But in that first process, it really tries not to be too biased. It’s in the second process, where it does the curation where it makes the selection for the community, where the filter narrows down [from 20,000 fragments to 350]. And the AI proposes stuff that covers a wider variety.  If you look at Botto's creation or what the community selects, you will actually see that so far Botto has not really developed a recognizable style, which I like.  How does Botto and the community think about what art is “commercial” and will sell as an NFT?  Everybody who's part of the DAO has to start thinking like an artist. They have to make the same kind of decisions such as, “Do I prefer something that is palatable, which is nice to look at, and probably sells? Or do we go for something more edgy that is hard, and maybe not everybody will like?” And every week, that decision changes again. There's always a mixture between typical, let's say, Midjourney-style stuff, which is nice, and then a few which are crazy, and of course I like the crazy ones.  And that's why Botto is constantly oscillating between these forces. Almost like an artist does.  There are, of course, critics who ask the question, “Is this REAL art?” But of course it’s more complicated than that, as creation -- throughout the history of art -- has involved borrowing bits and pieces from prior works, and then combining them in surprising ways. How do you think about this?  There’s a notion that when we create something, we kind of build it out of thin air, and then it’s an idea. But for me, creation is really more like discovery in the possibility space. And you can only create from what you know. You can recombine everything you know in different ways. And in a way, you look at it with your inner-eye and decide, “Is this an original idea? Is this aesthetically pleasing?” And as we all know, our tastes mature over time. The stuff you liked as a teenager you might find embarrassing now.  In that sense, when I look at Botto, it's also kind of going through everything that's possible within a given timeframe, and developing its own judgment that’s guided by the community. Then this becomes its creation.  So the short answer is, yes, I think what Botto is creating is very similar to how humans create, but of course, within its limitations. And at the same time, Botto, as the project, for me is going beyond just the picture creation process. The whole system is the artwork. And in that sense, that’s kind of what art is about, which is to push the boundaries.  In order to become an artist, you have to first declare that you are one, and then you're getting judged. In that sense, I have declared that Botto is an artist. Now it has to prove itself within the regular world of art. I would say it has already managed to go on that route. A few weeks ago, one of its works was auctioned at Christie's in New York. For a human, that’s kind of a bucket list thing for an artist to do.  How do you see AI art evolving in the future? Predictions?  Botto, in a way, is my answer to these new possibilities that everybody has now. And that’s the thing, right? We say now that everybody can become an artist. By using these [AI] models, you can create amazingly impressive imagery. The question is, how does that make you an artist in the broader sense? Because a machine can do that. So you still have to bring your own ideas, or you have to put them into the context of your artistic creation.  That's what makes it so difficult. Now everybody’s an artist, but if everybody’s an artist, then in a way, nobody is anymore, right?  Right, if all you’re doing is pressing a button, are you an artist?  Well, I mean, I think you can be an artist by just pressing a button. But if everybody can do that, then the problem is that the bar has to rise higher. Photography is the best example. Everybody can now buy a camera and take pictures, but that doesn’t make everybody a famous photographer.  So how will AI art evolve?  It will go bigger, more beautiful, more easy to use, and cover all media. It started with pictures. Now we already see we can do videos, sound, music, and all the media will be able to be generated by AI.  What’s still missing is the narrative element. To create a coherent narrative that’s underlying the entire thing. Is the machine able to produce something that goes beyond just being visually appealing? Is it able to bring our emotions to boil, or to make us really truly hate it or truly love it? Is it able to tell a story of any kind? That's still lacking.  It'll get there. I’ve played around with it myself to know it’s only a matter of time.  Oh, exactly. That's what I was going to say. It will come, and it will start on a smaller scale, and then it will go longer and longer, and then it will become very interesting.  Final question. So the way I understand it, each week the community votes on what Botto should do, and the DAO is a community of humans. Have you thought about bringing Botto to life, so to speak, and giving it Botto coins and giving it a seat at the table? Could Botto itself be a member of the DAO?  [Chuckles.] It's definitely an idea I would love to implement. I didn’t go for it yet because, at first, it needed a lot of backend stuff. But yes, I definitely want Botto to have a seat at the table. But there are dangers. The problem is the moment you put these models out there, people start trying to break it or to hack it. They might try to make it say stupid things or racist stuff. So I’m waiting until I feel it can be done in a way that is not [dangerous]. And I mean, once you turn it on, you can't always turn it off again.  Right. Once Pinocchio becomes a real boy, he’s out there in the world.  Yeah, exactly. Let's say, for now, Botto is this orphan, who’s not yet at the voting age. The family, or the stewards, is taking care of its wellbeing. But at the moment, it's still not ready yet. It hasn't got the full grasp of the world, and it’s not yet allowed to make life-changing decisions.  It’ll be fascinating to watch this orphan grow up. Congratulations on what you’ve built, and best of luck going forward.",POSITIVE,없음,MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/08/22/meet-botto-the-ai-artist-that-mints-its-own-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/310faa1eaf4a80dcd86db444f0ab6b14e4ae7bb8-773x435.webp?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Crypto is a mirage The study hinted at the increasing allure of digital currencies but cautioned against their mirage-like appeal. The research by BIS, a global financial institution known as the ""central bank for central banks"", pointed out the swelling enthusiasm for digital currencies. They cited their promise for faster and cheaper remittances, increased financial inclusion, and potential as an alternative investment vehicle. However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows; the BIS also underlined some inherent vulnerabilities. These include potential misuse for illicit activities, energy concerns associated with crypto mining, and heightened market risks. A complete ban is not the answer The BIS study further stressed that simply banning these digital currencies might not be the solution. Outlawing them could stifle innovation and push activities to unregulated sectors, increasing risks. Instead, the institution recommends establishing robust regulatory frameworks. These frameworks should prioritise transparency, combat illicit activities, and protect consumers while fostering technological advancements in the financial space. The paper concludes by highlighting that while cryptocurrencies are indisputably transformative, their optimal utility can only be realised in a well-regulated environment. It's a balance of harnessing their potential while ensuring they don't jeopardise the broader financial ecosystem's stability. Opinion It should be borne in mind when reading the BIS report that this organisation is set on seeing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) rolled out across the globe. CBDCs are only an extension of the existing fiat currencies but they can also be used to totally control spending, right down to the individual level. The BIS admits to being worried about cryptocurrencies going elsewhere if they are banned in certain countries, so their thinking is to put crypto into a regulatory straitjacket in order to stop private money in its tracks. To central banks and central planners decentralised money is anathema. They see the danger to the continuance of the fiat monetary system that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies present and will fight tooth and nail to suppress this new technology in order to be able to establish CBDCs and thereby obtain ultimate control over citizens.

42409879,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQDXH,1692718200,"Privacy Mixer Tornado Cash Is an Entity, Judge Says","A federal judge ruled against a group of Coinbase-backed investors and developers last week who alleged the U.S. Treasury Department overstepped its authority in sanctioning Tornado Cash. In doing so, he found that Tornado Cash had a DAO that could be sanctioned.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Stormy precedent  The narrative  Tornado Cash wasn’t really a good case for the crypto industry. It was definitely used by North Korea to launder stolen crypto, and now a federal judge has ruled that it was designated properly by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).  Why it matters  This is the second case where the existence of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) was used to find that a federal regulator was within its limits to bring an enforcement action against a crypto entity.  Breaking it down  The Treasury was well within its bounds to sanction Tornado Cash, barring all U.S. persons (U.S. citizens worldwide and residents in the U.S. itself) from transacting with or otherwise using the service, a federal judge ruled last week.  Judge Robert Pitman, of the Western District of Texas, said in a relatively brief written order that plaintiffs – including Prysmatic Labs co-founder Preston Van Loon, Ethereum supporter Alex Fisher, Coinbase employees Tyler Almeida and Nate Welch and a few others – had not successfully argued that their First Amendment rights or the Administrative Procedures Act had been violated.  Tornado Cash was sanctioned just over a year ago by OFAC, which alleged the mixer – which obscures the transaction history of crypto tokens by mixing all users’ money together – was an important tool for North Korea’s Lazarus Group.  Lazarus is perhaps most famously accused of using social engineering to steal more than $600 million in crypto from Axie Infinity’s Ronin Bridge.  In his order, Judge Pitman discussed the differing views on the role of the DAO governing Tornado Cash, the characterization of the smart contracts making up the mixer, the role of a relayer in the process and even the difference of opinion on whether Tornado Cash is the software itself or the DAO running it.  “It is undisputed that Tornado Cash uses smart contracts to provide a layer of privacy for its users by allowing them to deposit crypto assets in one wallet and then withdraw assets from a different wallet. Plaintiffs claim that as of 2020, the smart contracts are immutable, autonomous software applications with no custodial operator that automatically check the inputs necessary for a valid transaction, allowing withdrawals without human intervention,” he noted. “However, the government states that these smart contracts are created by Tornado Cash developers and then approved and deployed by the DAO, to provide customers with virtual currency mixing services on multiple blockchains.”  In his ruling, the judge found that Tornado Cash does meet the bar for being seen as an entity. Specifically, it’s an association composed of the project’s founders, developers and the DAO. OFAC sanctioned both the software itself and the group of people behind it in its order last year, he said.  This isn’t the first time a DAO was found to be an organization for court purposes by a federal court. Judge William Orrick, in the Northern District of California, found that Ooki DAO was an unincorporated association for the purposes of a Commodity Futures Trading Commission lawsuit.  The judge also found that Tornado Cash did have a property interest in the smart contracts, pointing to fees generated in TORN tokens as one example.  “Even if not every smart contract can be considered a contract, the record shows that Tornado Cash promoted and advertised the contracts and its abilities and published the code with the intention of people using it – hallmarks of a unilateral offer to provide services,” he wrote.  He also pushed back against the idea that code is abstract, saying the code for Tornado Cash’s smart contracts were not only deployed, but “convey[ed] an ongoing benefit … in the form of fees transmitted to the DAO.”  Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal has already said the exchange, which funded the original lawsuit, would support an appeal.  The question, then, is what sort of precedent we'll ultimately see with DAOs and their role overseeing crypto projects.  And, in the meantime, OFAC still faces another suit from Coin Center over the Tornado Cash sanctions.

Following the recent revelation, some speculations and theories have been trending about the owner of the mysterious wallet. BitInfoCharts Shares Data About Mysterious Wallet The crypto statistics platform, BitInfoCharts, provided data regarding the mysterious wallet. The data indicated that the wallet first received some BTC coins on March 8. Within three months and two weeks, the wallet amassed 118,000 BTC. Going by the current prices in the crypto market, the coins are worth $3.08 billion. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) At June Lows Again – Prospects For Bullish Recovery? Despite holding such a large number of BTC, the whale is still not the largest in the sector. Data from BitInfoCharts disclosed that the current largest Bitcoin wallets in the world belong to Binance and Bitfinex and these top two BTC wallets are currently operating as cold wallets. Binance’s cold wallet emerged as the global largest BTC holder on March 10, 2021, with 143,528 BTC. It progressed gradually to hit an all-time high of 299,427 BTC by June 2021. But the wallet’s holding as of June 2023 was 248,597 BTC coins worth over $6 billion, according to the current prices. On the other hand, Bitfinex’s cold wallet is ranked the second-largest BTC holder, while the mysterious wallet occupies the third position currently. Interestingly, the fourth-largest Bitcoin wallet is another Binance cold wallet. Does BlackRock Own The Mysterious Wallet? Following the emergence of the mysterious wallet as the third-largest Bitcoin holder, speculations and theories started flowing within the crypto space and many have suggested the possible owner of the wallet. One X (formerly Twitter) user, DivXMan, pointed out that the mysterious wallet witnessed its initial major transaction of 3,400 BTC tokens on May 16, 2023. One month later, the largest global asset manager Blackrock filed for a spot in Bitcoin ETF on June 15. Another user posted a huge black rock, suggesting that the wallet belongs to BlackRock. This has triggered a rumor that BlackRock could be the owner of the unknown wallet. This is based on close timing between its Bitcoin ETF filing and the wallet’s key accumulation of BTC. However, the theories about BlackRock being the possible owner of the mysterious wallet lack concrete evidence. Notably, the application for a spot BTC ETF from BlackRock created a large wave within the crypto market. And if the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves the filing, it would become the first Spot Bitcoin ETF to trade in the US.

The company is known for its “zero-knowledge” proofs, a type of cryptographic technology that’s now being used by several competing projects to scale the Ethereum blockchain, with the goal of increasing transaction throughput and reducing fees.  The STARK Prover is a key component for the tech, and has been referred to in the past by the project team as its “magic wand” – responsible for compressing transactions and creating cryptographic proofs.  According to Starkware, open-sourcing the prover will “allow more eyes to review the code and offer optimizations, improve its quality, help detect bugs and provide transparency.”  Starkware had previously announced in February that it had plans to open-source its prover, at a Starkware Session event in Tel Aviv. On Aug. 31, the code will be made available during a Starknet Summit session.  “This is a major step forward in the decentralization of StarkWare’s technology that enables the community to build upon and contribute to the Prover’s development independently,” Starkware said in a blog post.

42409872,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQDGk,1692713410,FedNow Is a Reminder That Payments Aren’t Crypto’s Differentiator,"Payments, especially those across borders, are often touted as a key use case and value proposition for the blockchain industry. Unfortunately, a look at both the technology, competition, and regulatory environment doesn’t really support that idea. And the launch of FedNow by the Federal Reserve in late-July is a good occasion to take a look at why, for most people and companies, the value proposition of using crypto or blockchains for basic payment services isn’t very appealing.  Paul Brody is Global Blockchain Leader for EY (Ernst & Young). Under his leadership, EY is established a global presence in the blockchain space with a particular focus on public blockchains, assurance, and business application development in the Ethereum ecosystem.  Blockchains and crypto ecosystems have compelling advantages in other areas, but fiat payments aren’t one of them. First and foremost, simple, high-volume payments are cheaper and faster to execute in centralized systems. Blockchains have complex consensus mechanisms and many nodes in which ledger data is distributed. This means that while centralized payments flow quickly through a single infrastructure, blockchain payments get copied to thousands of nodes and are subject to varying degrees of speed and cost based on network congestion.  Transaction fees for FedNow are expected to be in the range of $0.05 each or less. Automated Clearing House (ACH), the most common inter-bank payment method in the U.S., presently costs between $0.25 and up depending on the provider. Bitcoin fees average around $1, though they can vary a lot, and transaction fees on Ethereum are similarly high and variable. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have accelerator networks that can bring costs back down towards $0.04, though these are not yet widely available and we don’t have experience with large volumes to know if they will stay that low.  The second big obstacle to widespread adoption of blockchain payments is path dependency. We already have widely deployed simple payment systems linked to debit cards and bank accounts. It’s rare for new technologies to come in and wipe out older infrastructure unless it has a compelling advantage and, in most cases, blockchain payments are at best price competitive, but without many advanced features that retailers and others depend upon for handing things like chargebacks, refunds and loyalty points.  Blockchain payments are at best price competitive, but without many advanced features that retailers depend upon  One area that is often cited by blockchain and crypto boosters as particularly promising is cross-border remittances. In these cases, fees in the traditional banking and payment systems are quite high and many people are simply not served by that system because they don’t have bank accounts. Unfortunately, the root cause of high fees and lack of services isn’t a technological one that can be fixed with blockchains. The real obstacles that add cost are often regulatory, infrastructure or a lack of competition.  The regulatory problem is mainly that in some countries, the law does not permit banks to open accounts for people with limited or no personal identity documentation or whose documentation would show them to be working or living in that country illegally. Where those obstacles have been eased or governments have made it a priority to bank the unbanked, banks have been quick to serve these groups. Brazil, India, Kenya and Tanzania are all shining examples of how quickly banks and financial services entities can charge into a market when the regulatory and identity obstacles are eased. All these countries have thriving markets for low-income users that have “banked” millions of in recent years.  Read more: Fed Dramatically Speeds Up U.S. Payments With FedNow, but Downplays Any Tie to CBDCs  The second big cost driver for cross-border payments is a combination of infrastructure and regulation. By infrastructure here, I don’t mean computing infrastructure, I mean the physical variety: supply chains for moving money and disbursing it. Sending cash from one person to another requires physical infrastructure to receive and disburse cash. Western Union is reported to have over 500,000 access points worldwide and their competitor, MoneyGram, claims as many as 300,000. Physical retail costs more to maintain purely online systems and also acts as a huge competitive differentiator. Incumbents have been building their retail networks for literally decades. Western Union has been in the money transfer business since 1871.  It’s instructive to compare online to online payments with cash-to-cash payments at companies that offer cross-border remittances. I did a quick survey looking at two providers and two currencies and fees ranged from 1-2% for entirely digital payments to 5% or more for a transfer of $250 in physical cash from and to a retail location.  Where it makes sense  While I think the odds of blockchain payments replacing credit cards or debit cards are low, there are two cases where I think blockchains have exceptional value. And I think it is in those areas where blockchains have immense value to create in the payment space.  The first is in everything that isn’t traditional fiat money. The banking system is an amazing set of infrastructure that does an astonishingly good job of moving lots of money reliably and at low cost. And none of it works for anything other than money. The genius of tokenization is that you can apply the discipline that banks bring for money (the prevention of double spend) to anything of value.  The second compelling value proposition is that you can make payments in the exact same ecosystem in which you take delivery of the item you are buying. Every transaction involves the exchange of money for stuff. In the real world, the money and the stuff reside in completely different systems. The can of soda you buy in a convenience store is tracked in a different inventory system and your payment comes through the banking system. The real cost of this transaction isn’t the payment, it’s the reconciliation across all the different systems.

Big-Name Partnerships Fade Away Despite its initial promising trajectory and significant partnerships, NFT startup Recur has made the disheartening announcement that its Web3 platform is shutting down. The platform's inability to withstand the challenges of the crypto winter has led to this unexpected decision. Recur had set sail with grand ambitions, boasting partnerships with iconic brands such as Hello Kitty and Nickelodeon. However, the cold winds of the crypto winter have taken a toll on the platform's sustainability. The firm acknowledged that its core features would gradually phase out over the coming months, including the withdrawal of NFTs, cashing out stablecoin balances, and trading collectibles on Recur-hosted marketplaces. A Shift In The NFT Space Established in 2021, Recur positioned itself as a provider of Web3 ""building blocks"" for businesses, enabling the creation of in-game assets, loyalty programs, and digital collectibles through NFTs. However, Recur's fate is not unique, as the broader NFT space witnessed the closure of companies like Nifty, which had also secured partnerships with big media titles. With over 380,000 minted NFTs, Recur is working to ensure the legacy of these digital collectibles. The company plans to migrate metadata and media for its NFTs to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized file-sharing network. Additionally, other assets will be hosted on Filecoin's network, indicating Recur's commitment to maintaining the digital artifacts it helped create. A Shift In Value Recur's journey included milestones like the Recur Pass, which was initially sold as an NFT for $300 and granted holders early access to NFT drops. Despite an impressive early sale of a Recur Pass for $88,888, current prices reflect a stark contrast, with the cheapest pass listed on OpenSea for 0.001 ETH (about $1.69). Recur had garnered notable attention with a $50 million Series A funding round in late 2021, valuing the company at $333 million. Esteemed investors like Gary Vaynerchuk, the Winklevoss twins, and Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin participated in an earlier $5 million seed funding round. Despite the initial momentum, Recur's journey underscores the volatility and challenges inherent in the NFT landscape. In conclusion, Recur's announcement to shut down its Web3 platform serves as a sobering reminder of the challenges faced by NFT-focused companies in the ever-evolving crypto space. The dissolution of big-name partnerships and the necessity to adapt to changing market dynamics highlight the fragility of even the most promising ventures.

42409854,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQCd4,1692710514,Sam Bankman-Fried Pleads Not Guilty to Latest Indictment,"NEW YORK — Sam Bankman-Fried again pleaded not guilty to fraud and money laundering charges tied to the collapse of his crypto empire, FTX, last year during a court appearance Tuesday.  The FTX founder was arraigned in the Southern District of New York courthouse after a new indictment accused him of using customer funds for everything from buying personal real estate to political donations. The charges are from the original indictment filed last December, and fold a campaign finance charge into other allegations after prosecutors said they couldn't explicitly bring the charge due to treaty obligations with the Bahamas.  Magistrate Judge Sarah Neburn oversaw the hearing, reading out each charge in turn and asking Bankman-Fried if he wanted her to read through the whole indictment (“no,” he said) before asking how he pled.  Bankman-Fried was present in his first court appearance since losing his bail earlier this month. Clad in a tan uniform, he glanced over to – and briefly smiled at – his mother, Barbara Fried, in the audience before rushing over to the table where his attorneys sat, escorted by a U.S. Marshal. His father, Joseph Bankman, was not present at this arraignment, unlike Bankman-Fried’s Aug. 11 hearing.  In the minutes before the arraignment began, Bankman-Fried was in deep conversation with his attorneys.  Tuesday's arraignment comes amid requests from the defense team to let Bankman-Fried meet with his attorneys and have access to internet-enabled laptops at the U.S. Attorney's office every weekday. Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is overseeing the case, ruled Monday that Bankman-Fried could meet with his attorneys until 3:00 p.m. EDT today at the office, but has not yet weighed in on the broader request.  One of Bankman-Fried’s attorneys, Christian Everdell, brought up the issue again during Tuesday’s hearing, arguing that the FTX founder’s Sixth Amendment rights were being violated. Since his detention, he has had no access to discovery, Everdell said.  Bankman-Fried needs to be able to use internet-enabled laptops to review the “millions of” documents produced during discovery, he said.  “There is no way for him to effectively communicate his work product, his analyses to us,” he said. “He needs to be performing analyses.”  Danielle Kudla, an assistant U.S. attorney, noted that the issue had already been briefed before Judge Kaplan, who had rejected the request.  “You know magistrate judges don’t typically outrank…” Netburn said, trailing off to laughter from the gallery.  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried Due Back in Court as He Asks for Daily Releases  Conditions at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center, where Bankman-Fried has been held since Aug. 11, were a primary point of focus for Bankman-Fried’s other attorney, Mark Cohen.  Cohen deplored the prison’s lack of vegan options, stating “because he’s following his principles, [Bankman-Fried] is only now subsisting on a diet of bread and water.”  Cohen also said the prison had failed to provide the FTX founder with Adderall, a drug commonly prescribed for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Bankman-Fried was also running low on his supply of EMSAM, an antidepressant, according to his attorney.  Both attorneys argued that the combination of a lack of internet access and a lack of proper food and medication would hamper Bankman-Fried’s ability to put up a proper defense to what Cohen described as a particularly complicated set of charges.  Netburn said she would look into both issues after the hearing was adjourned, and that she hoped to resolve them by the end of the day.  Prosecutors have, for their part, asked the court to order Bankman-Fried's defense team to share more information about his proposed ""advice-of-counsel"" defense, including what he is claiming counsel advised. The judge set a Wednesday deadline for the defense to share more information.  Bankman-Fried's trial is set to kick off in early October. Prosecutors and defense attorneys filed proposed jury instructions late Monday, detailing how they believe the judge should explain the charges and allegations to jurors.

Terra.money Now Phishing Site Over the weekend, the Terra.money website fell under the control of hackers who were using the site to launch phishing attacks on whatever users were left on the platform. Kiruse, an esteemed web3 developer at Terra, took to Twitter to sound the alarm about this phishing site that's masquerading as the authentic Terra website. The site's sinister objective revolves around duping unsuspecting users into divulging their highly sensitive and confidential information. The domain in question, terra(dot)money, is presently under intense scrutiny due to its alleged involvement in this phishing endeavor. The perpetrators manipulated the website to pilfer sensitive user data, employing tactics that led users to unwittingly reveal their seed phrases, putting both cryptographic keys and funds in severe jeopardy. Alerts and Precautions Terra's response was swift. On August 19, the platform issued a stern warning against engaging with any site under the Terra money domain. This caution was reiterated the very next day, on August 20. Further efforts to bolster safety and security came from Station Wallet on August 21, advising users to steer clear of the Station desktop and mobile apps until their safety can be ensured. The team has also issued a strict directive for users: rely solely on the official communication channels—namely X (Twitter), Discord, and Telegram. This strategic move is aimed at ensuring that users receive authentic and trustworthy information during this period of uncertainty. Temporary Shutdown And Road Ahead In a bid to fend off these phishing scams, the Layer-1 blockchain Terra took the proactive step of temporarily shutting down its website. The team released an official statement on X, ""The terra(dot)money domains have successfully been frozen to prevent further user phishing scams, but a full resolution is still underway. Our team has been working around the clock to rectify this issue, but we’ve encountered delays with some third-party responses.” Terra is still recovering from the devastating crash of the Terra/LUNA ecosystem last year. The company is desperately attempting to rebuild its reputation by replacing CEO Do Kwon, who was arrested and then released on bail. Furthermore, news of undisclosed wallets containing $160 million worth of digital assets belonging to Do Kwon has not helped his case. It remains to be seen if the Terra team is able to deal with the new phishing attack on top of its existing troubles. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

16385864,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548336,1692707439,Bitcoin Dip Worth Buying? What Market Sentiment Suggests,"The current sentiment among Bitcoin investors may hold the key to understanding whether the current drop is a buying opportunity or not. “Buy The Dip” Optimism Is Fading In The Bitcoin Market In a new insight post, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has looked into how the trader sentiment has shifted in the BTC sector since the crash a few days back. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Retest $20,500 Again? This Pattern May Suggest So First, the analytics firm has checked for the amount of “buy the dip” types of calls that have been happening on social media recently. Looks like the value of the metric had been quite high not too long ago | Source: Santiment Here, Santiment has made use of its “social volume” metric, which finds the unique number of social media posts that are making mentions of a given term or topic. Naturally, the social volume for Bitcoin/cryptocurrency is taken here, and has then been filtered for terms like ‘buy’ and ‘dip.’ From the chart, it’s visible that the social media users were participating in some heavy discussion around such topics just when the Bitcoin crash toward the $26,000 level occurred a few days ago. This implies that the traders were optimistic that the asset would quickly recover and they believed that the drop presented an ideal buying opportunity. As the asset has only continued to move sideways since the crash, however, optimism on social media has appeared to have slowly vanished, as ‘buy the dip’ calls have plunged. However, this is not all bad news as Santiment points out. “Believe it or not, it’s a good sign that people are no longer certain that this is a dip buy spot,” explains the analytics firm. “It means that pessimism is beginning to take over again as market caps fade.” Historically, bottoms have become more probable to form the more pessimistic about the market the majority of the traders have been. Thus, this development can potentially allow the coin to recover. In terms of the social volume broken across the major social media platforms, it would appear that Redditors have still not given up hope for a reversal. Buy the dip calls on Telegram, Reddit, Twitter, and 4chan | Source: Santiment While the overall market sentiment may have cooled down, it would seem that it hasn’t yet happened on all platforms equally. But it may provide a unique opportunity for a good entry point. “When all four social platforms align and have settled back down to neutral mentions of buying the dip, this is when the actual opportunity has historically presented itself for patient traders,” notes Santiment. Related Reading: XRP Whales Accumulate, Can Price Recover Now? A sign that may not be so positive can be the fact that the “social dominance” of Bitcoin, the percentage share of the total social volume of the top 100 assets, has dropped back to normal levels, after briefly hitting the highest level of 2023 following the crash. The metric's value has cooled down a bit | Source: Santiment This would mean that social media users are still engaging in discussions related to altcoins, which is a sign that there is still greed left in the market. Ideally, the Bitcoin’s social dominance should remain high. “High discussion related to the #1 asset coincides with fear, whereas discussions about more speculative assets tends to coincide with greed,” says the analytics firm. “Fear is when markets rise.” Overall, it would appear that the market sentiment is moving in the correct direction, but it hasn’t yet completely aligned in a way that has historically been favorable for a Bitcoin rebound to occur. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $26,000, down 11% in the last week.

The duo claims that their collaboration has the potential to redefine what's achievable in digital advertising, particularly in combating lack of transparency and inefficiency. As Verasity has long argued, the advertising industry has grappled with challenges around transparency. Advertisers are often in the dark about where their ads appear, raising concerns over brand safety and ROI. The new partnership looks set to address these long-standing issues by integrating VeraViews' 'Proof of View' (PoV) technology into Alkimi Exchange's ad platform. Within the collaboration, Alkimi's network of publishers can tap into VeraViews' ad stack, thus gaining access to a verified audience within VeraViews' network. Simultaneously, VeraViews will be able to scale up its monetization through Alkimi Exchange’s robust network of advertising partners. “The decentralised advertising ecosystem is still nascent, and we’re delighted that VeraViews and Alkimi Exchange have found ways to leverage our innovative technology solutions in synergy, working together to achieve our common goal of bringing trust and transparency to the programmatic advertising supply chain,” says David Murray, Demand Director at VeraViews. Ben Putley, the CEO & Co-Founder of Alkimi Exchange, adds, ""Our collaboration symbolises not just a mutual understanding of our industry’s future, but also a shared commitment to drive sustainable growth, forge new pathways, and redefine the boundaries of what’s possible. "" Broader Impact on the Advertising and Blockchain Landscape Verasity has already been a strong advocate for using tech-based solutions to battle chronic challenges that plague digital advertising for several years. Its technology is already integrated into several significant video hosting and publishing platforms, including its notable partnerships with Brightcove Marketplace and Hoopla Digital. The integration between VeraViews and Alkimi Exchange could serve as a significant step in eradicating some of these pervasive issues – which according to British newspaper The Guardian affects a whopping 25 percent of all digital advertisements. Should this alliance between VeraViews and Alkimi Exchange demonstrate success in mitigating fraud and increasing transparency, it may pave the way for broader adoption within the burgeoning blockchain sector – and in turn revolutionize an industry that is estimated to rise to more than a trillion US dollars annually in the coming years.

The U.S. Department of Justice and Sam Bankman-Fried filed competing sets of jury instructions for the October trial of the FTX founder a day before he is set to be arraigned on a new superseding indictment. Prosecutors filed the document, titled ""the government's requests to charge,"" late Monday, adapting from various previous sets of jury instructions including past statements from Judge Lewis Kaplan, the Southern District of New York judge overseeing Bankman-Fried's case. The FTX founder faces seven different charges, ranging from wire fraud, securities fraud and commodities fraud conspiracy to money laundering allegations, to which he has pleaded not guilty.  Social platform Friend.tech, which lets holders buy ""shares"" of people who hold an account on X, formerly known as Twitter, and grants the buyers certain privileges, has surged to more than 100,000 addresses since its Aug. 10 launch according to a database created by Yearn Finance developer @Bantg. The database, listed briefly on GitHub and now withdrawn, apparently listed the crypto wallet addresses and linked X accounts. The growth correlates with the huge revenues made by the platform since the launch, with over $25 million in fees generated, according to DefiLlama. A Dune Analytics dashboard corroborates the finding, pegging the number of unique users to at least 80,000, with 15,000 users added since Sunday.  Chart of the day  The chart shows spread between bitcoin’s next month and front month futures contracts trading on the CME and bitcoin’s spot market price.  The spread remains elevated after last week’s 10% slide.  Historically, negative spread has marked interim and bear market bottoms.

42409885,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQMO9,1692705600,"Crypto’s ‘Illusory Appeal’ Should Be Met by Regulation, Not Bans, BIS Study Says","Developing countries are major crypto users, given volatile exchange rates and lack of access to banks.  Central bankers from Latin America reiterated concerns about crypto failing to deliver on its promise, but say the technology should be controlled, not forbidden.  Crypto is failing to reduce financial risks in emerging markets, but the response should be regulation rather than an outright ban, a grouping of central bankers led by Mexico and Colombia said Tuesday.  Emerging economies are popular places for people to try crypto because volatile fiat currency and a lack of access to banks make it attractive to look for alternatives to traditional finance. According to Chainalysis data, just two of the 20 top crypto-using jurisdictions across the world are from the developed world, with the likes of Vietnam, Brazil and India making up the remainder.  But promises to cushion people from the impact of inflation or offer a low-cost payment alternative are just part of crypto’s “illusory appeal,” the study said. While crypto is a popular way of sending funds overseas, it can also result in “large and sudden changes in the flow of capital,” the report warns – a financial stability impact that central bankers are normally wary about.  “Cryptoassets have so far not reduced but rather amplified the financial risks in less developed economies,” the study, published by the Basel-based Bank for International Settlements (BIS), said, adding that regulating the sector would be preferable to a full ban, given the difficulties of enforcement and risks of curbing innovation.  “The technology could still be applied in various constructive ways,” the study said, adding that regulations will need to “channel innovation into such socially useful directions.”  The advent of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on crypto could heighten risks, allowing a wider range of people without specialist finance knowledge to get into the market, the report said. In June, the world’s biggest asset manager, BlackRock, filed to operate an ETF based on the spot price of bitcoin (BTC) in the U.S.  The skepticism of global organizations against crypto is nothing new. In July, BIS said that crypto can’t be used as money due to “inherent flaws,” while the United Nations’ development arm has said emerging economies should bring in widespread restrictions to curb risks to tax collection and monetary policy.  The report echoes comments made by key U.S. and International Monetary Fund officials, who advocated for a similar regulation-over-ban approach at a recent G20 roundtable.

The protocol also expanded its cash management offering to Solana after halting using the network following the FTX collapse.  Blockchain-based credit marketplace Maple Finance has turned its attention to Asia and will expand into the region with a $5 million investment round, the firm said on Tuesday.  BlockTower Capital and Tioga Capital led the fundraising round with Cherry Ventures, The Spartan Group, GSR Ventures and Veris Ventures participating, according to a press release. Previous investors Maven 11 and Framework Ventures also committed capital.  “This funding round marks a pivotal moment in our evolution as we embark on a strategic expansion into the APAC (Asia-Pacific) region as part of a comprehensive growth plan for Maple,” CEO Sidney Powell said in a statement. “The network is poised to further scale its technology and forge partnerships that enable compliant and seamless lending and borrowing adoption across the APAC region, specifically in Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong and Korea,"" Powell added.  Maple’s focus on Asia showcases the region’s increasing importance for the digital asset industry. Asian countries have taken charge in setting up clear rules for crypto firms to service consumers, which is in stark contrast to the regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. Hong Kong recently handed out the first licenses to trading platforms under the new crypto regime, while last week Singapore’s central bank released a regulatory framework for stablecoins. U.S-based exchange Gemini expanded in the region with a new hub in Singapore earlier this summer.

The facility, only available on Ethereum before, allows accredited investors, companies, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) to park their spare stablecoin stash in one-month U.S. Treasury bills and earn a 4-5% annual yield.

Dogecoin’s Connection With Elon Musk Increases Hopes of Integration For Top Meme Coins,"A connection between meme coins and popular social media platforms has altered how we perceive meme cryptos. Dogecoin (DOGE)’s playful attitude may find a new home and utility on X, formerly known as Twitter. Elon Musk, an elusive tech tycoon, is at the heart of this enticing proposition. Musk's well-documented liking for meme coins has aroused the interest of both enthusiasts and bankers. Do Elonator Coin (ETOR) and Dogelon Mars (ELON), two Elon-themed meme coins, also have the possibility of future integration with X.com? Could this be the beginning of a cryptocurrency revolution led by top meme coins? Will Dogecoin’s Token Integrate With X.com? Dogecoin began as a playful jest and quickly captivated the hearts of a global community. Dogecoin has proved its capacity to transcend traditional concepts of digital assets with its unique Shiba Inu logo and lighthearted approach, which piqued interest in its possible inclusion into a platform as significant as Twitter/X. The incorporation of Dogecoin into X might result in the widespread adoption of digital assets. Dogecoin's incorporation into Twitter's redesigned platform, X, gives a fascinating potential to alter the convergence of social media and cryptocurrency. This possible collaboration might not only enhance Dogecoin's standing in the crypto realm but also make the digital asset ecosystem more accessible and entertaining for new investors. Integrating X and Dogecoin could bridge the gap between online culture and technology. Dogelon Mars: A Distinct Theme With A Playful Charm A dog-themed meme currency, Dogelon Mars operates on the Ethereum blockchain. It takes the same route as other digital currencies like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Floki Inu in its meme-centric focus. Its name is a mix of Dogecoin and Elon Musk, a multibillionaire businessman and outspoken Twitter supporter of Dogecoin. This currency has sparked considerable attention, raising the issue of whether it can follow in the footsteps of Dogecoin and benefit from integration with Twitter's X platform. Musk's participation in Dogelon Mars, while not as obvious as his involvement with Dogecoin, demonstrates Musk's ability to expand his influence beyond a single cryptocurrency. As Musk's space exploration efforts gather traction, Dogelon Mars' community-driven attitude matches his goal, creating a beneficial relationship that might lead to increasing demand and possible price increases. > Elonator Coin Next In Line For Integration To X.com The Elonator token was designed with a special combination of comedy, cultural significance, and promising investment opportunities. It seeks to write a new chapter in the history of meme-based digital assets. With this innovative strategy, the token may significantly advance the utility and adoption of cryptocurrencies in addition to acting as a speculative tool. Elonator supports a project that is driven by the community and benefits all of its investors. This dedication goes beyond the typical meme coin incentives. Investors receive significant rewards, including a brand-new Tesla. The Elonator protocol is further advanced than the invention of a passive revenue source. It also resolves a number of issues that have plagued the crypto industry thus far. The creation of a strong and varied community is Elonator's top aim. Elonator's possible integration with Twitter's newly renamed platform, X, carries the promise of a mutually beneficial connection that may completely alter the parameters of online interaction. Users might encounter a fresh manner of dealing with cryptocurrencies by integrating Elonator's capabilities into the X platform. It’s Time To Join Elonator Presale Elon Musk’s move to rename Twitter as X heralds a new age of possibilities, suggesting an intention to expand beyond its existing identity. As Twitter/X attempts to revolutionize the user experience, the inclusion of Dogecoin appears to be a bold move toward embracing the unorthodox and promoting unique interactions. And this can only mean good things for the new meme coins emerging. This inclusion acts as a catalyst as more people get interested in digital currencies, boosting awareness and adoption to new heights. It's time to invest in the Elonator Coin presale and be part of the future when the lines between social interaction and finance are redefined. As more top meme coins move to integrate with X.com, the growth and ROI opportunities will only continue to grow, too.

16383245,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548355,1692702918,Altcoin Season In Limbo As Bitcoin Dominance Bounces Off Key Support,"Market observers are closely eyeing the tussle between Bitcoin and its altcoin counterparts. Bitcoin’s dominance, a critical indicator of its market influence relative to the entire crypto market, has reached a pivotal crossroads. This juncture holds the potential to determine whether this year’s trend of Bitcoin outperforming altcoins will persist or if the heralded “altcoin season” is on the horizon. Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) stands as a percentage value that calculates Bitcoin’s market capitalization against the entire global crypto market capitalization. This metric has garnered substantial attention due to its role in reflecting shifts in market sentiment. Since May 2021, Bitcoin dominance has oscillated within a range of 39% to 49%. However, early June this year marked a breakout from this range, with BTC.D briefly surging above 52% before retracing toward the 49% level in recent weeks. A successful retest of this level could trigger new bullish momentum for BTC against altcoins. On the flipside, a drop below this level could trigger a longer-term drop towards 39%, the range-low which would trigger the start of a new altcoin season. This Is What Bitcoin And Crypto Experts Predict Daan de Rover, a prominent Crypto YouTuber, emphasizes the importance of understanding the broader market cycle before predicting an “altcoin season.” He argues that the current phase, being the pre-halving stage of the Bitcoin cycle, might not be the optimal time for altcoin investments. Related Reading: Bitcoin On-Chain Data Suggests Price Is Top Heavy, What It Means De Rover highlights that a minor retracement in Bitcoin dominance shouldn’t overshadow the overarching upward trajectory, advising that the right time for significant altcoin investments usually occurs after Bitcoin surpasses its all-time high. “We are currently in the pre-halving stage of the cycle, which is generally not the best time to buy altcoins. Bitcoin dominance might drop by 3%, but this is likely just a minor retracement in a larger upward move.” emphasized the crypto YouTuber. Benjamin Cowen, the founder of ITC Crypto, sheds light on the shifting sentiment, stating, “In June, many said BTC dominance would never break 49% and that alt season was about to begin. Now those same people are dunking on BTC dominance because it had a pullback to 49%. The altcoin casino will remain open until all the money is gone,” indicating that the altcoin market’s potential is far from exhausted. Michaël van de Poppe, the CEO and founder of MN Trading, delves into historical patterns to discern the optimal time for investing in altcoins. He suggests that the best opportunity emerges around 8-10 months before a Bitcoin halving, during a period of low market confidence. Van de Poppe indicates that the performance of altcoins often hinges on Bitcoin pairs, asserting that they show interest in the markets and initiate rallies when least anticipated. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reaches Most “Oversold” Record Since 2020: What This Means Highlighting the cyclical nature of the market, van de Poppe references past instances when altcoin strength followed historical patterns despite market variables. He references examples like Ethereum’s cycle low in September ’19 and October ’15, occurring precisely 252 days before Bitcoin halvings, which heralded altcoin bull runs. The next two or three weeks will probably decide who is right and whether Bitcoin will continue its dominance or if altcoins will make their move and become the favored asset. Investors should therefore watch BTC.D closely.

Two years later and El Salvador is flourishing. IMF against decentralisation Max Keiser, pro Bitcoin entrepreneur, now living in El Salvador, was interviewed on the Swan Bitcoin YouTube channel, where he gave his thoughts on the IMF and how El Salvador is on a much better path. Keiser started by saying that in his view the IMF was akin to a central bank, and that central banks do not like decentralised money, and that the IMF does not like the idea that El Salvador can adopt Bitcoin and decentralise itself away from the fiat monetary system. Years of US exploitation Keiser quoted John Perkin’s book “Confessions of an Economic Hitman” which tells of US-backed hitmen who he claims were out to instigate coups and topple governments. He said that the US always looked upon Latin America as its own “backyard” and that it was there to be controlled with the help of huge multinational corporations such as the United Fruit Company which heavily exploited the countries in which they were based. Keiser said that since Bitcoin came into being with its decentralised and sound money, it was putting central banks out of a business that has been perpetuated for 300 years and would end up making them extinct, and in the process also make the IMF irrelevant. El Salvador’s energy program One of the biggest excuses for detractors maligning Bitcoin is its heavy use of energy for its proof-of-work consensus. However, Keiser explained how El Salvador will use geothermal energy to supply the power for Bitcoin mining. Nevertheless, the lead time for developing such an infrastructure is around five years, therefore the country is developing its wind and solar plants to help fill in the gap until volcano power is fully harnessed and online. $1 billion was raised for this project, of which $250 million has already been allocated. Keiser talked of how in the future countries will compete to provide the Bitcoin hashrate, and how El Salvador was the only country in the world to have a pro-Bitcoin mining policy right now. The IMF and central banks across the world should be very worried. Financial technology has moved on and will leave all these legacy financial institutions in the dust of yesterday.

As a single sequencer chain, Coinbase controls how fee revenue from network activity will be used. The company wants to donate some of that revenue to OP Collective. At current levels, Base is generating roughly $42 million in annualized fees and is one of the more profitable networks in crypto. In my last article covering Coinbase ( COIN ), I focused mainly on what I felt the recent ruling in the Ripple ( XRP-USD ) case meant for Coinbase's ongoing lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In this article, we'll look at the latest product offering from Coinbase and estimate to what degree it could generate incremental revenue for the company. Declining CEX Volume In a summer that has been eventful for the crypto industry from both news and regulatory climate standpoints, transaction volume on centralized exchanges like Coinbase has been less than impressive. Between May and July, the total transaction volume for the major centralized exchange (or CEX) businesses averaged a little under $450 billion. CEX tx Volume (Monthly) (TheBlock) By comparison, the monthly average over the same timeframe in 2022 was over $1 trillion. Some of this decline in monthly CEX volume is explainable by more trading volume share going to decentralized exchanges, or DEXes: DEX Share of total tx vol (TheBlock) In May 2022, DEX share of spot trade volume was 14.6%. That number grew to 22% in May 2023. But the larger reason for plummeting CEX volume is because of less aggregate trading rather than share loss to DEX applications. Despite these declines in CEX transactions, Coinbase has been able to navigate the drying well that has been monthly trading volume by increasing revenue from other segments. In Q2-23, subscription and service revenue made up more than half of Coinbase's total revenue; up from just 18% a year ago. Data by YCharts Despite the fact that the company has lost money for 6 consecutive quarters, Coinbase was able to keep negative net income under 9 figures for the second straight quarter in Q2-23. I view that as fairly positive given the lack of growth in the company's traditional line of business. Coinbase is clearly adapting revenue models and with the recent launch of ""Base,"" COIN shareholders have another revenue stream to consider for future earnings assessments. What is Base? Base is yet another Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) scaling network. However, this one has been developed and launched exclusively by Coinbase. The network is based on Optimism's ( OP-USD ) OP stack and there is a mutually beneficial relationship between the two teams given the interoperability. Like Optimism, Base utilizes optimistic rollups to batch transactions on a secondary blockchain layer built on top of Ethereum. The reason these secondary, or L2, chains exist is due to the scaling challenges on Ethereum's main network. Ethereum avg tx fees (USD) (IntoTheBlock) When the network gets congested, Ethereum's fees spike and transactions become prohibitively expensive for lower value usage. We saw this happen back in May when the average transaction fee on Ethereum spiked to over $20 per transaction. What the L2 networks do is allow for ecosystem users with smaller value transactions to essentially share the cost of the main layer fee by grouping their transactions together. Base Model (Token Terminal) This ultimately results in fees for both the main network and the scaling network. But the fee at the individual user level is far less than it would be if they were transacting on the main layer solo. In the graphic above, the figures are shown as an example. So far in practice, the share of transaction fees for Base has been much higher than 20% and we'll explore those metrics shortly. L2 Market & Early Base Data Some of the more popular Ethereum scaling chains include Arbitrum ( ARB-USD ), Optimism, Polygon ( MATIC-USD ), StarkNet and zkSync. There is quite a bit of competition in this area but even after launching just a few weeks ago, Base is already competitive with some of the top ETH scaling chains in terms of Daily Active Users: L2 Monthly average DAUs (Token Terminal) Base is already averaging about 83k DAUs for the month of August having just launched a short time ago. This already makes Base a top 5 scaling chain by active users: Monthly Average DAUs July 2023 August 2023* Polygon 383,417 384,887 Arbitrum 158,851 147,822 Optimism 100,212 112,199 Starknet 95,074 120,768 Base 7,521 82,765 Source: Token Terminal, *as of 8/20/23 What often happens when a new chain or application begins is airdrop hunting. This can create large unsustainable surges in usage when a chain launches - that activity level often dissipates after a new governance token is airdropped to early users. From where I sit, this is less of a risk for Base due to the fact that Coinbase is already a publicly traded company and doesn't necessarily need to create a new asset for platform governance. Daily Transactions (Dune Analytics/tk-research) From a pure activity standpoint, the early indications from Base are very positive. Since launch, Base has generated roughly 12 million cumulative transactions and has been averaging about a half million transactions each day for most of August. Base TVL (L2Beat) Looking at DeFi numbers, Base is already the 5th largest L2 on Ethereum with nearly $240 million in total value locked. There are currently over 70 protocols on the network and top protocol dominance for BaseSwap is 29.9%. In my view, these are healthy numbers. Revenue For Coinbase The market getting another option for scaling Ethereum is wonderful. But for the benefit of COIN investors, it's difficult to argue this effort matters all that much if it doesn't result in incremental revenue for shareholders. Fortunately, since the entire point of an ETH scaling network is for assets to live on-chain, we can follow activity in real time to assess how much Coinbase might be earning from Base usage. Base Cumulative Fees/Revenue (Dune Analytics/tk-research) Cumulatively, Base has generated about $3.5 million in fees in the short time since launch. If we annualize that figure, Base is on pace for a little under $42 million in revenue from L2 activity. This would not make Base one of Coinbase's larger sources of revenue, but the annualized figure is also assuming activity and margin levels stay flat. Which in my view is unlikely. Base July August Total Fees $0.90m $2.56m $3.46m Expenses $0.19m $0.93m $1.12m Earnings $0.71m $1.63m $2.34m Profit Margin 79.3% 63.6% 67.7% Source: Token Terminal, *as of 8/20/23 It's admittedly very early but Coinbase's margin on those fees has been terrific so far. Combining data from both July and August, Coinbase has collected nearly $3.5 million in Base fees with a little over $1.1 million in on-chain expenses. This makes Base not only more profitable than the other leading ETH scaling chains, but it's currently one of the most profitable chains in all of crypto after Ethereum and Tron ( TRX-USD ). While this is clearly not enough revenue to get the company to profitability at current network activity levels, it is a good start for a network that is only a few weeks old. Risks The obvious risk is that network activity on Base potentially cannibalizes the company's CEX trading volume. Longer term, I think that may be a valid concern. However, I'm less convinced of that in the shorter to medium term given Ethereum accounts for 21% of Coinbase's transaction revenue. For me, the bigger risk to Base as a revenue-generating product are the company's long term plans to decentralize the network and the commitment to OP Collective Public Goods. While Base has started by being incubated inside of Coinbase, the team is deeply committed to progressing towards full decentralization over the years ahead. As a network, Base has a single, private sequencer in Coinbase. This means Coinbase doesn't have to split Base network fees with any other entity though it is choosing to do so anyway. The company's Head of Protocols Jesse Pollak has indicated through various media appearances that a portion of Coinbase's sequencer fees will go to the OP Collective to fund further development of ecosystem initiatives. Ultimately, the timeline on when Base will be more decentralized isn't all that clear from where I sit. But if/when that decentralization truly begins, there will have to be an incentive structure for the additional sequencers and that means Coinbase will almost certainly be splitting fees. Summary I think Base is a very interesting move for Coinbase. The trend in trading volumes over the last three years has shown increasing share for DEXes. This is not a good thing for centralized exchanges and it makes sense that Coinbase would want more of an on-chain presence because of this. COIN now offers the market an on-ramp, a wallet application, and an OP network. There's a potentially strong synergy for Coinbase users who may buy ETH and other tokens through Coinbase and send the coins to the Base network for on-chain activities. In this way, COIN gets paid twice by the same user - first on the original purchase and then on the network fee to send the ETH to Base. And that's before any on-chain swap fees that may happen later by that same user. But it's still way too early to tell if Base will remain a top 5 ETH scaler or if the company's eventual end of its "" Onchain Summer "" campaign will result in diminished interest in Base. Given the amount of TVL in Base's DeFi protocols, I don't expect activity to simply disappear in September. But I'd wait for a clear monetization plan from the company before buying COIN due to any perceived early success with Base.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | OP,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4630199-base-assessing-coinbases-new-l2-network?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/16381390.jpeg

42409895,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQMyW,1692699063,Bitcoin Settles in Below $26K as Altcoins Lead Crypto Declines,"Bitcoin (BTC) slipped about 1% during U.S. trading hours on Tuesday to $25,800, with Solana (SOL), Polygon's (MATIC), and Steller's (XLM) among those altcoins down more than 4% over the past 24 hours.  The broad CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) was lower by 1.7%, with ether (ETH) underperforming, down 2.2%.  Looking for a catalyst  With the strong U.S. economic data of late having apparently taken off the table any idea of the Federal Reserve making a dovish pivot on monetary policy, crypto bulls – desperately in search of any positive catalyst – have now pinned their hopes on a spot bitcoin ETF.  While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has a number of spot bitcoin ETF applications to rule on, there's no guarantee that a decision will even come this year. More imminent, traders hope, would be a court ruling in Grayscale's lawsuit versus the SEC over that agency's denial of Grayscale's attempt to convert its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF.  There had been chatter that a court decision would come last week, but it never happened, and bulls were frustrated further when nothing was announced this morning.  Wishful thinking dies down  A bump in mentions of “buy the dip,” a dictum among traders referring to purchasing assets that are discounted relative to fundamentals, on social media forums flattened out amid the lame price action.  “We saw a huge rise in 'buy the dip' mentions. This indicates that trader optimism was quite high that there would be a quick market recovery,” Santiment said in a Monday note. “But looks at how the wishful thinking has died down considerably in the past few days.”  The firm scraped data from Reddit, X, Telegram and 4Chan for the findings. Falling mentions meant traders were no longer certain of a market recovery and that “pessimism was beginning to take over again as market caps fade,” it said.  Professional traders were, however, likely to utilize sophisticated instruments such as futures and options to make returns, analysts at crypto exchange Bitfinex shared with CoinDesk in a note.  “Data suggests that long volatility strategies have been deployed extensively over the weekend after the price crashed below the $25,000 level,” the analysts wrote. “In turbulent times, traders might expect high volatility to continue and use options strategies (like straddles or strangles) to profit from this.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Shaurya Malwa, Stephen Alpher",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/22/xrp-ada-post-highest-losses-among-majors-bitcoin-steady-as-buy-the-dip-mentions-fade,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3d393e27c675a247f2773f445e9c5723d6e3315d-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The coin’s value, currently hovering around $0.517 according to CoinGecko, experienced a 1.0% decline in the past 24 hours alone. Over the span of a week, XRP witnessed a significant 17.4% slump, reflecting the ongoing volatility that has come to characterize the cryptocurrency market. Despite its potential, XRP’s journey to break through the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a significant technical indicator, has hit a roadblock, casting doubts on its short-term performance. XRP price action today. Source: Coingecko Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) At June Lows Again – Prospects For Bullish Recovery? Understanding XRP’s 200 EMA And Its Impact The 200 EMA is a widely followed technical indicator that helps traders and analysts gauge the overall trend of a cryptocurrency’s price. It calculates the average price of an asset over a specific time period, giving more weight to recent data points. Breaking through the 200 EMA is often seen as a bullish sign, suggesting that the cryptocurrency’s price is gaining momentum and may experience upward movement. However, XRP’s recent struggle to surpass this threshold highlights the challenges it faces in regaining solid footing in the market. Market observers suggest that the failure to breach the 200 EMA could be attributed to the broader market sentiment, regulatory concerns, and the ongoing lawsuit between the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple. XRP market cap at $27 billion today. Chart: TradingView.com XRP: Weekend Recovery And Regulatory Complexities Over the weekend, XRP exhibited signs of recovery, momentarily soothing investor jitters. Notably, this recovery came in the absence of any new regulatory filings from both the SEC and Ripple regarding their ongoing lawsuit. The lawsuit has played a crucial role in shaping XRP’s price trajectory, causing significant fluctuations based on legal developments. In the initial stages of the SEC-Ripple lawsuit, the SEC categorized XRP as a “digital asset security,” raising concerns about its regulatory status and potential impact on the broader cryptocurrency landscape. XRP seven-day price action. Source: CoinMarketCap However, the regulatory body has since shifted its stance, asserting that digital assets lack inherent value and are merely strings of computer code. This evolving perspective has introduced a layer of complexity to XRP’s regulatory outlook, influencing both investor sentiment and price dynamics. As the XRP market navigates through these regulatory intricacies and attempts to find stable ground, analysts and traders are keeping a close eye on both technical indicators and legal developments. The dynamics between these factors will likely continue to shape XRP’s trajectory in the coming weeks, with the cryptocurrency community closely watching whether it can overcome the hurdles posed by the 200 EMA and regulatory challenges.

As a crypto investor, getting access to reliable insights into an exchange’s reserves and overall safety should be the norm. 8 months only after its launch, Finst becomes the first and only Dutch cryptocurrency platform to unveil an extensive Proof of Reserves audit conducted by AuditNow, a reputable and independent Dutch audit firm. The audit was skillfully led by AuditNow’s CEO, Daniël Waknine, a distinguished member of the World Compliance Association who has previously been collaborating with esteemed institutions such as BNP Paribas and ING holding. As part of its Proof of Reserves audit, Finst has developed a comprehensive framework which provides full transparency on its structure, operations, assets, liabilities, business activities and overall safety. Challenging traditional Proof of Reserves limitations Traditional Proof of Reserves audits merely focus on an exchange’s on chain holdings, with a scope often being limited to certain crypto assets, thus excluding the cash reserves of an exchange and its liabilities. Besides, traditional PoR audits do not verify whether an exchange has an effective segregation of assets in place, which is key in providing maximum safety as it prevents commingling of assets. Julien Vallet, CEO & co-founder, commented: “Our analysis of various Proof of Reserves (PoR) statements highlighted a need for greater clarity in this area. Traditional PoR tend to leave important questions unanswered for investors, which is why we decided to develop a new standard which goes far beyond the verification of on-chain holdings.” The outcome of Finst’s Proof of Reserves audit The results of this thorough and independent audit confirmed that Finst holds the entirety of its clients’ assets on a full reserve basis (1:1) and has an effective segregation of assets in place through a bankruptcy-remote vehicle. Additionally, the audit verified the following key points: Finst has policies and procedures in place to correctly safeguard its clients’ assets The designated roles and responsibilities in the safeguarding procedures are fulfilled A strict restriction of assets transfers to designated senior management employees is enforced Clients’ assets are held in a bank account and wallets through a bankruptcy-remote vehicle, without any possibility of commingling funds All clients’ assets have been acquired through users’ deposits, without the use of any loans There is no transfer or use of clients’ assets by any third party Clients’ assets are fully available, with a maximum time frame of 2 days Finst’s collateralization rate is >100% for all coins listed on its platform All cryptocurrencies listed on Finst’s platform have been included in the audit scope The exchange also confirmed that it will renew its comprehensive Proof of Reserves audit at least every 6 months to ensure continuous and transparent information for its clients. Julien Vallet, added: “Cryptocurrency investors rightfully deserve to know how well they are protected, especially in the wake of recent global exchanges collapses. We were surprised to see that no Dutch crypto platform has ever released a Proof of Reserves, and we firmly believe that this should become a standard practice. We extend an open invitation to all crypto platforms to join us in embracing this vital initiative so that we can collectively enhance the transparency and safety of the entire industry.” To learn more, please read the Proof of Reserves statement (EN).

The exchange is laying off 71 employees whose roles do not fit into current business priorities, a company spokesperson told CoinDesk on Tuesday. The Mumbai-based company, founded by Neeraj Khandelwal and Sumit Gupta in 2018, has about 590 employees. Several teams were affected by the job losses.  India has imposed stiff taxes on crypto, including a 30% tax on crypto profits and the more controversial 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on all transactions since Feb. 1 2022. The TDS, in particular, and global bear market in crypto have severely impacted trading volumes and therefore revenue, pushing the country's crypto exchanges into survival mode. Khandelwal told CoinDesk in May that CoinDCX had enough cash to keep operating for four years.  ""Startups and businesses globally are going through challenging times due to tough macro conditions, more so in crypto because of the prolonged bear market and impact of TDS on domestic exchanges,"" the company said in a statement. ""These factors had a significant impact on our volumes and thus revenues ... we have made the difficult decision to resize certain teams and to steer the business towards a profitable and sustainable growth.""  “Today marked one of the most difficult moments for me and Neeraj in our journey at CoinDCX,” Gupta wrote in a LinkedIn post. “We had to make a tough choice that involved bidding farewell to some of our brilliant and dedicated team members at CoinDCX.

It was claimed in a report that Banteg, a core contributor to Yearn Finance, had published scraped details of Friend.tech users, including Twitter usernames and addresses. Friend.tech Denies Report The report suggested that data posted by a pseudo-anonymous developer for Yearn Finance, Banteg, was leaked information. According to the report, the information published contained scraped details of over 100,000 Friend.tech users. However, the Friend.tech team countered the report, stating that the information published by Banteg came from scraping its public API. In a post on X, the Friend.tech official feed stated the report was basically saying we got hacked by someone who simply looked at our Twitter feed. The post also called out the publication that published the report. “This is just someone scraping our public API that shows the association between public wallet addresses and public Twitter usernames. It’s like saying someone hacked you by looking at your public Twitter feed.” The post by Friend.tech also received input from X’s Community Notes contributors, stating, “The underlying data is public, and anybody can work it out by reading a block explorer: if you buy a share, 5% goes to the creator’s wallet, and he will have needed to fund his wallet. The database only scraps that public info.” Banteg’s Original Post Banteg had published a repository containing publicly available scraped data, including critical details of users on the Friend.tech platform on GitHub. The details include wallet addresses on Base and the corresponding Twitter usernames of over 100,000 users. Banteg stated in a post, “101,183 people have given friend.tech access to post as them, leaked db (database) indicates.” He also drew attention to Friend.tech’s permissions, insisting that users had granted the app to post on their behalf without a complete understanding or consent. Notably, Banteg’s post regarding the data came after a post from blockchain analytics service Spon-On-Chain, which noted that Friend.tech’s API revealed specific information not available to typical users of the app. Spot-On-Chain also gave an example of this, stating that wallets created by certain users could be viewed through the API. Spot-On-Chain stated that this information could potentially be used to game the system by allowing bots to almost instantaneously purchase shares of big accounts as soon as they signed up on the Friend.tech platform. Spot-On-Chain added, “A lot of bots have already taken advantage of this, it monitors the contract, finds the big KOL, and buys shares before others.” Meanwhile, X users saw the funny side of the unfolding situation, with one user posting a link to the Ethereum block explorer and claiming that they had discovered a leaked database of all transactions on Ethereum. Friend.tech is a Web3 social application on the Base Layer-2 chain. It gives users a platform to trade shares in Twitter accounts, giving shareholders unique features such as access to private chat rooms. The platform has gained considerable traction since its launch, particularly due to a number of high-profile signups. Friend.tech had also recently generated over $1.4 million in protocol fees, putting it among the top three crypto projects when it came to fees. The project ranked only behind Ethereum and Lido.

The coin’s recent retracement to June lows has garnered significant attention from bullish investors, even as the broader crypto market remains hounded by uncertainties and price plunges. With the cryptocurrency market experiencing a notable downturn over the past week, Polygon’s native token, MATIC, has not escaped unscathed. The token’s value has witnessed a decline of nearly 19% over the span of seven days, further amplified by a 4% drop in the last 24 hours alone. The current CoinGecko-listed price stands at $0.547. MATIC price action today. Source: Coingecko The present state of MATIC at $0.54 marks its lowest valuation this year, with year-to-date lows just shy of the June benchmark of $0.59. The recent downturn is closely linked to the broader market crash, during which Bitcoin suffered a plunge to $26,000, triggering nearly $2 billion in liquidations. Technical Indicators Signal Caution For MATIC Technical indicators echo the prevailing bearish sentiment surrounding MATIC. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) notably retreated to the oversold territory on August 17th and continues to linger there. This persistent oversold condition underscores the ongoing selling pressure that has yet to abate.

Chart: TradingView.com Similarly, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has maintained a position below zero, indicating a subdued influx of capital. This trend accentuates the bearish outlook for MATIC in the spot market. Navigating The Road Ahead For Polygon Despite its recent dip, MATIC encountered a measure of stabilization at the bullish order block (OB) situated above the $0.50 level. Notably, this level aligns with the June lows, which have historically facilitated successful rebounds upon retesting. This downturn has visibly impacted investors, leading to growing losses in their portfolios. However, the overall strength of Bitcoin—whose performance has been lackluster—might potentially hinder MATIC’s ability to stage a robust recovery. MATIC seven-day price action.

In the midst of this challenging environment, MATIC enthusiasts and market analysts alike are closely monitoring the coin’s technical indicators and its ability to hold above the critical support level of $0.50.

The new terms will see Coinbase acquire an equity stake in Circle, with the two also shutting the Centre Consortium, which initially governed the stablecoin. Coinbase Takes Equity Stake The new agreement reflects the shifting economics and popularity of the USDC stablecoin and comes at a time when it is facing competition from other stablecoins in the market and an uncertain regulatory environment. Competing stablecoins include offshore rival Tether and the recently announced PayPal stablecoin. As part of the new terms, Circle will also be launching USDC on six new blockchains over the next few months. The company hopes this will increase the adoption of the stablecoin, although it has not provided any details about how. In an update published on its website, Circle stated, “Circle and Coinbase, the founding companies behind Centre Consortium, a jointly managed self-governance consortium for USDC, have agreed that with growing regulatory clarity for stablecoins in the U.S. and around the world, the requirement of a separate governance body like Centre is no longer needed.” It is also still unclear how big of a stake Coinbase got in Circle. However, what is known is that Coinbase did not give Circle cash for the deal, according to sources familiar with the matter. It is also not known which six blockchains will see the introduction of USDC. Circle did state back in September 2022 that it was looking to add Near, Polkadot, Optimism, and Cosmos. “USDC will be launching on six new blockchains between September and October, bringing multi-chain access of USDC up to 15 to continue accelerating USDC’s momentum with developers around the world.” A Strong Alignment For Long-Term Success Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire stated that the new arrangement helps to “tune up the economics in a way that felt really fair for both of us.” He further stated that the equity lays the foundation for a good, strong alignment for long-term success. Coinbase and Circle previously operated using a revenue-share agreement outlined in financial disclosure forms from both companies. The split was based on the amount of USDC distributed by each firm and the amount of USDC held on each platform. Under the new agreement, income generated through interest will be equally shared from off-platform USDC, such as USDC held in DeFi wallets. A Major Change For USDC The shuttering of Centre is a significant change for USDC. The initial whitepaper showed Centre as a steward for a global, interoperable payments network that focused on consumers and would include a number of fiat-backed tokens. However, so far, Centre has only launched USDC, while Circle issued a euro-backed stablecoin which was accessible on two blockchains. However, recent initiatives around USDC have targeted the crypto developer community. These include the launch of cross-blockchain transfers and programmable wallets, which also reflect on the predominance of DeFi. Governance To Shift Under Circle Centre initially described itself as a consortium but only included Coinbase and Circle as members. This is because partnerships with other firms did not materialize. The organization, at one point, had over 20 employees, although this figure dwindled to under 10 in recent months. The new arrangement will see the governance of USDC shift under Circle. According to Allaire, governance under a separate entity like Centre was no longer needed as governments worldwide developed and adopted stablecoin legislation. Spurring Growth For the moment, Coinbase and Circle face a different challenge, that of spurring the growth of USDC. Back in March, Circle revealed that around $3.3 billion of the reserves backing USDC were stuck at Silicon Valley Bank. As a result, the stablecoin had briefly lost its peg to the dollar. However, the price recovered after the federal government guaranteed Circle’s deposits with the bank. However, USDC has seen a considerable decline in its market share, with most of the stablecoin market moving to Tether. Tether’s market cap is currently around $83 billion, while USDC is around $26 billion. The stablecoin markets have also seen a considerable shakeup with the introduction of PayPal’s PYUSD stablecoin, launched in partnership with Paxos.

16375418,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548321,1692689683,"Bitcoin On-Chain Data Suggests Price Is Top Heavy, What It Means","After the Bitcoin price crash last week, on-chain data reveals a picture that points to a “top-heavy” price. Glassnode’s latest insights shed light on the current market dynamics, where a significant chunk of the BTC spot supply finds itself with a cost basis either near or surpassing the prevailing price. “Here we see that 12.8% (2.48M BTC) of the supply fell into an unrealized loss this week, setting a lower low on this metric. This suggests that ‘top heaviness’ in spot markets may also be a factor in play,” commented Checkmate, Glassnode’s chief analyst. Notably, Long-Term Holders (LTHs) have displayed remarkable resilience in this turbulent period. Their interaction with exchanges remains largely unaltered, with the aggregate balance of LTHs marking a new All-Time High (ATH) this week. In stark contrast, the behavior of Short-Term Holders (STHs) emerges as particularly salient. Related Reading: Glassnode Co-Founder’s Prediction: DXY Set To Peak, Fueling Potential Bitcoin Rally To $37,000 Checkmate notes, “With LTH supply at ATH, we can also see that STH supply remains at multi-year lows.” The data further underscores this: out of the 2.56M BTC held by STHs, a mere 300k BTC (11.7%) remains in profit, meaning that 88.3% are in loss. This needs to recover quickly, else it adds to the bear case, according to Checkmate. Historical data indicates sharp upticks in STH supply losses following periods characterized as ‘top heavy markets’ – similar to the events observed in May 2021, December 2021, and once again, the last week. Implications For Bitcoin Price The fluctuating dynamics between profits and losses witnessed in the market can be further distilled through the Profit or Loss Bias (dominance) metric. As the 2023 rally unfolded, a discernible shift was noted in the STH cohort’s position: “This week we saw the largest loss dominance reading since the March sell-off to $19.8k. This suggests that the STH cohort are both largely underwater on their holdings, and increasingly price sensitive,” added Checkmate. An intriguing revelation comes from Glassnode’s experimental tool aimed at discerning market inflection points. With a meticulous design that maps macro trends of investors and the prevalence of profitability over losses (and vice versa), this tool offers a nuanced ‘Momentum indicator’. According to Checkmate, “We can see that after several months of declining profit dominance, Loss momentum and dominance have increased meaningfully.” Notably, while false positives have been recorded – as observed in the March 2023 correction – sustained declines have historically been precursors to sharper downtrends. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reaches Most “Oversold” Record Since 2020: What This Means Overall, the Bitcoin price crash on August 17 stands as the most significant single-day decline YTD. The sell-off was primarily a futures market leverage flush out, and is thus primarily a result of short-term positioning and market structure. However, the predominant sentiment is one of caution, largely because the most significant impact has been technical, specifically falling below long-term moving averages, a factor that could sway market sentiment. Long-Term Holders remain stoic, but the spotlight is on the Short-Term Holders. With an overwhelming 88.3% (equivalent to 2.26M BTC) of their supply at an unrealized loss, combined with an uptick in realized losses sent to exchanges and a breach of key technical support, the onus is on the bulls to defend their stance. Checkmate concludes: There is for sure potential for further downside momentum, but the majority of the damage is positioning and technical. The bull case is that realistically nothing has changed aside from the price, and the R/R still favors the upside. Calls for 12k are kidding themselves, but calls for 100K are as well. Net Result == same as every pre-halving year ever. At press time, the Bitcoin price stood at $26,084.

42409887,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQMUl,1692688886,Shiba Inu Plans Shibarium's Public Restart Days After Botched Launch,"Shiba Inu developers are slowly working towards a Shibarium network reopening by monitoring validator data and transactions days after a much-hyped network launch was marred by network issues and a faulty bridge.  In a post early Tuesday, the project’s key developer, who goes by Shytoshi Kusama, said the network was “almost ready to reopen to the public” and had mechanisms in place to prevent an outage repeat.  “After two days of testing and tweaking parameters to achieve ""ready"" state Shibarium is now enhanced and optimized,” Kusama said. “As mentioned it is still in testing, but producing blocks.”  “Moreover, we have enabled a new monitoring system and additional fail-safes including rate limiting at the RPC level and auto server reset in case we get a huge level of traffic again,” he added.  Shibarium is an Ethereum layer-2 network that uses SHIB tokens as fees in what is part of a broader plan to position Shiba Inu as a serious blockchain project. It is said to have a focus on metaverse and gaming applications while finding use as a cheap settlement for DeFi applications built atop it.  A testing period for Shibarium saw significant success, with millions of wallets participating and conducting some 22 million transactions over a four-month period.  But last week’s launch quickly fizzled out. Transactions on the network were stalled for at least eleven hours shortly after going live, with millions of dollars stuck on a bridge, or a tool that transfers tokens between different networks. SHIB prices plunged 10% at the time.  Developers responded to the outage stating that ""there was no bridge issue"" and that the problem occurred following an unprecedented mass influx of transactions from users. They claimed servers failed as users overloaded the network with transactions – much higher than the handling capacity of those servers.  The network was later closed to the public and is set for a reopening now that these errors are supposed to be fixed. As such, developers are already allowing validators – or entities who provide computing resources to process network transactions – to start taking initial steps for the reopening.  “Tomorrow additional validators will go live, giving even more options for you to stake BONE for a share of the rewards,” Kusama wrote in Tuesday’s update. “Testing will wrap up, and we will prepare for public consumption once again.”  SHIB prices were down 4.3% in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows.",NEUTRAL,SHIB,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SHIB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/22/shiba-inu-plans-shibariums-public-restart-days-after-botched-launch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea4a7db7373043932c3fbc9bc3d2c19c85d98e71-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The firm agreed to a cease-and-desist order and will pay a $850,000 fine. In a statement released on Monday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission alleges that Titan Global Management used “hypothetical performance metrics in advertisements that were misleading.” Titan Accused of an Array of Transgressions According to its statement, the SEC also charged the New-York-based Fintech firm with “multiple compliance failures that led to misleading disclosures about custody of clients’ crypto assets, the use of improper “hedge clauses” in client agreements, the unauthorized use of client signatures and the failure to adopt policies concerning crypto asset trading by employees.” The press release further explains the SEC’s order: “The SEC’s order further finds that Titan (1) made conflicting disclosures to clients about how Titan custodied crypto assets; (2) included in its client advisory agreements liability disclaimer language that created the false impression that clients had waived non-waivable causes of action against Titan; and (3), contrary to representations, failed to adopt policies and procedures concerning employee personal trading in crypto assets. The order also states that Titan self-reported to the SEC staff that it failed to ensure that client signatures were obtained for certain types of transactions in client accounts and agreed to settle related charges.” The SEC said that from August 2021 to October 2022, Titan made “misleading statements” on its website and advertised “annualized” performance results of up to 2,700% for its Titan Crypto strategy product. Chief of the Enforcement’s Complex Financial Instruments Unit, Osman Nawaz, said: “When offering and marketing complex strategies, investment advisers must ensure the accuracy of disclosures made to existing and prospective investors. The Commission amended the marketing rule to allow for the use of hypothetical performance metrics but only if advisers comply with requirements reasonably designed to prevent fraud.” Adding, “Titan’s advertisements and disclosures painted a misleading picture of certain of its strategies for investors. This action serves as a warning for all advisers to ensure compliance.” Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, Titan agreed to a cease-and-desist order to pay a $850,000 civil penalty which will be distributed to affected customers, to pay $192,454 in disgorgement and prejudgement interest. The SEC hastened its crackdown on the crypto industry this year, sued Binance and Coinbase, charged 18 defendants involved in DEBT Box, charged Hex founder Richard Heart with securities violations, and warned auditing firms over misleading crypto audits.

42409899,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQN8R,1692681790,"Bitcoin Looks Most Oversold Since Covid Crash, Key Indicator Suggests","A technical analysis indicator shows extreme oversold conditions in bitcoin as surging bond yields weigh over risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin's 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has dropped well below 30, indicating oversold conditions. The indicator has dropped to its lowest since the coronavirus-induced crash of March 2020.  The RSI is a momentum indicator ranging between 0 to 100 that shows the asset's recent price movement relative to its average price movement over a specific period, usually 14 days.  A reading below 30 reflects oversold conditions, implying that the price has dropped too quickly relative to its recent average. Meanwhile, a reading above 70 indicates overbought conditions.  One of the mistakes that the crypto community on X (formerly Twitter) and most rookie traders make is to consider oversold and overbought readings as advance hints of an impending bullish and bearish reversal.  But that's not the case. An oversold RSI reading means prices have dropped too quickly – that's it, while overbought reading indicates prices have rallied fast.  If anything, the latest below-30 or oversold reading on the RSI is a sign of strengthening bearish momentum. As the old saying goes, indicators can stay oversold longer than dip buyers can stay solvent.  According to Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at the FxPro, bitcoin's trend has shifted bearish.  ""Bitcoin closed the [last] week with a notable drop below its 200-week and 200-day moving averages, signaling a shift to a bearish trend. From current levels near $26,000, the following area of decline appears to be the last pivot area at $24,700,"" Kuptsikevich said in an email.  Bitcoin changed hands at $26,000 at press time.

Prosecutors filed the document, titled ""the government's requests to charge,"" late Monday, adapting from various previous sets of jury instructions including past statements from Judge Lewis Kaplan, the Southern District of New York judge overseeing Bankman-Fried's case. The FTX founder faces seven different charges, ranging from wire, securities and commodities fraud conspiracy to money laundering allegations, to which he has pleaded not guilty.  Monday's filing from the Department of Justice (DOJ) lays out each of the different counts arrayed against Bankman-Fried in detail, explaining the differences between ""substantive crimes"" and ""crimes of conspiracy.""  A separate filing made by Bankman-Fried's own lawyers shortly after suggest that he may argue he honestly believed his use of customer funds was not unlawful. The filing suggests his behavior amounted to honest mistakes in judgment and errors of management rather than crimes – and plays with the idea that crypto, currently unregulated, represents a legal gray area.  ""If Mr. Bankman-Fried acted in good faith with respect to the use of FTX customer funds and with the belief that as a business matter, FTX would be able to cover all customer withdrawal requests, he did not act with specific intent to defraud,"" Bankman-Fried's filing said, telling the jury that ""It is also not relevant whether you believe certain conduct should have been regulated even though it was not regulated at the time.""  The DOJ has already questioned Bankman-Fried's apparent reliance on an ""advice of counsel"" defense – that he believed actions were lawful based on his own discussions with lawyers.  The substantive crimes ""charge a defendant with the actual commission or attempted commission ... of an offense,"" the DOJ proposal says, while the conspiracy charges require an agreement with another individual.  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried Due Back in Court as He Asks for Daily Releases  The proposed DOJ jury instructions also spell out what jurors must keep in mind if they vote to convict: that there was a scheme to defraud, that the defendant ""knowingly and willfully participated"" in said scheme and that the defendant used interstate wires (which includes the internet).  Bankman-Fried is currently set to go on trial at the beginning of October. He was recently remanded to jail after Judge Kaplan revoked his bond. The judge ruled that the onetime FTX CEO had violated his bail conditions in contacting FTX.US general counsel Ryne Miller and sharing former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison's diary with the New York Times.

16361228,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548295,1692666040,RUNE Beyond Swaps: THORChain Introduces New Lending Protocol,"In a recent development, THORChain (RUNE), the liquidity network, has unveiled its lending feature, enabling users to leverage their native Layer-1 (L1) assets, such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), to secure loans denominated in TOR, a USD equivalent stablecoin. According to the announcement, this move opens up new avenues for financial participation, allowing users to borrow funds without the “burdens” of interest, liquidations, or expiration. THORChain Introduces Interest-Free Loans The lending process is designed to be user-friendly and “straightforward,” focusing on minimizing cognitive burden. Depending on prevailing market conditions, borrowers can collateralize their assets within a range of collateralization ratios (CR), ranging from 200% to 500%. The CR determines the amount of debt borrowers can receive in proportion to their collateral. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Follows This 1930’s Chart, Why BTC Could Keep On Falling One of the critical advantages of THORChain’s lending protocol is the absence of interest charges. By eliminating interest, the protocol encourages borrowers to hold onto their loans for extended periods, thereby increasing the equity value of the protocol. This approach aims to align the interests of borrowers with the protocol itself, fostering a mutually beneficial ecosystem. Furthermore, THORChain’s lending system does not involve liquidations. In traditional lending models, borrowers risk having their collateral forcibly sold if its value falls below a certain threshold. However, THORChain’s design eliminates this risk by treating the collateral as equity (RUNE IOU). Consequently, if the collateral falls below the debt value, it does not pose a problem, as the stored equity acts as the liability. Per the report, this approach ensures a more user-friendly experience and eliminates the need for borrowers to monitor asset prices constantly. The loans issued through THORChain’s lending feature have a minimum period of 30 days, providing borrowers with flexibility. Repayment can occur anytime after the initial 30-day period, allowing borrowers to manage their debt according to their circumstances. Partial repayments are also possible, although the collateral is not released until the debt is fully repaid. THORChain’s Circuit Breaker System To enhance security and protect against inflation, THORChain has implemented a circuit breaker mechanism. In the event of a drastic drop in RUNE’s price-native token of the THORchain network- against collateral assets such as BTC and ETH, which could lead to net inflation of RUNE, the system will pause new loans and disable the lending feature. At this point, no further inflation of RUNE can occur, and the protocol’s reserve will cover the remaining collateral payouts. Initially, the lending feature will support BTC and ETH collateral, with plans to expand to other Layer 1 gas assets, including Binance Coin (BNB), Litecoin (LTC), Avalanche (AVAX), and DOGE. According to the announcement, this expansion will further diversify borrowing options, accommodating a broader range of users and assets. Related Reading: Gemini Hits Back At SEC Lawsuit With Dismissal Filing Overall, with the introduction of the lending feature, THORChain takes a significant step toward expanding financial opportunities within its liquidity network. As of the latest update, THORChain’s native token, RUNE, has experienced a decline of nearly 8% within the past 24 hours, currently trading at $1.694, despite the anticipation surrounding the announcement of the new lending protocol. Nevertheless, the token has successfully maintained substantial gains of 20% and 80% over the past seven and fourteen days, respectively, attributed to a simultaneous increase in the social volume of the THORChain cryptocurrency.

The reason behind this is the massive token unlock that is set to occur this week, which will undoubtedly place more sell pressure on the already struggling price of the digital asset. $102 Million In AVAX Set To Be Unlocked The Avalanche network, like a lot of others, has locked a portion of its total token supply to be released into circulation on a periodic basis. Given that these unlock events can put bearish pressure on a token, they can often be a signal to exit. Related Reading: Bitcoin Liquidations Top $500 Million Amid $1 Billion Crypto Decimation For AVAX, the next token unlock event is set to take place on August 26, five days from now. But the most interesting thing about this event is the number of tokens set to be brought into circulation. According to the token tracking website Token Unlocks, a total of 9.54 million tokens are set to be unlocked on Saturday. This accounts for 2.77% of the total circulating supply of the asset, worth $102.29 million at current prices. 2.77% of token supply set to be unlocked | Source: Token Unlocks The website also shows that the unlocked tokens are being distributed in four allocations. These include 1.13 million tokens ($12.06 million) for airdrop, 1.67 million tokens (17.87 million) for Foundation, 2.25 million tokens ($24.12 million) for strategic partners, and 4.5 million tokens ($48.24 million) for the team. With this unlock, over 55% of the total token supply will be unlocked, leaving less than 45% of the supply locked. And as these 9.54 million tokens make their way to the market, it could be very bad for investors. Will AVAX Price Be Impacted? Given the allocation of the $102 million in tokens set to be unlocked, it is likely that a large chunk of it is going to hit the open market. As a result of such a large amount of selling, the AVAX price will certainly be impacted, making an already bad situation worse. This will likely see the price of the digital asset fall below $10 for the first time since July 2021. Trading in the single-digit will see AVAX holders plunged further into losses, even though the vast majority are already sitting in the red, according to data from IntoTheBlock. Related Reading: Why Is Dogecoin Price Down Today? AVAX’s indicators are also incredibly bearish at this point with the price sitting below the 100-day and 200-day simple moving averages. This rules out a recovery for the digital asset in the short term, especially with the unlock event coming up. At the time of writing, the AVAX price is sitting tentatively at $10.56, down 13.15% in the last week.
