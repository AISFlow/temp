42400551,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK1cs,1508968695,RAND Report: Timing Essential for Blockchain Standards,"The European wing of the RAND Corporation, a US think tank, has argued for a slow-and-steady process for developing possible standards around blockchain.  In a new report published on October 18 and prepared for the British Standards Institution (BSI) – the world’s first group of its kind and the official standards body for the United Kingdom – the think tank identified several areas that could be the target for standards developers. In RAND's view, the potential opportunities that blockchain offers are ""vast"" despite the ""many challenges to contend with.""  That said, the report’s authors also caution that the sector may be too nascent at this time to justify a serious investment of time by either governments or private-sector business.  The report also cautions that the sector may not be far enough along to justify a serious investment of time by businesses or government. Further, it reckons that ""the timing for developing and introducing standards (which may build on existing standards) is critical,"" advocating for a not-too-early but not-too-late approach.  ""An intervention that occurs too early could run the risk of locking in stakeholders to solutions that, in the long run, might not be the most effective and, in the process, potentially stifle innovation,"" the report states. ""A standards strategy that occurs too late with regard to a technology potentially risks missing opportunities to maximise the benefits the technology could deliver.""  Caution aside, the report details the areas in which standards could be applied, including interoperability, data privacy and identity, among others.  With the report, RAND – which receives some of its funding from the U.S. military and works for a variety of government agencies and private businesses within Europe – becomes the latest group to advocate for the development of standards (albeit on a perhaps longer timeline).  And in what is perhaps a nod to the ongoing work being pursued by the BSI, the report also suggests that standards-makers consider the wider impact of their work before moving ahead with any concrete proposals.  ""Although it is a field characterised by rapid change and uncertainties, steps can be taken to better understand the current realities, drivers of change and impacted sectors,"" the report’s authors said.

""I'm a strong believer in blockchain in terms of its wider application in our industry,"" he added.  His comments came after bitcoin reached another all-time high over $6,100 last week, followed by a few days' fallback to around $5,500 as of press time. Yet at the same time, they come amid a range of finance-related applications for the tech, particularly around capital markets.

And Hong Kong Stock Exchange is also on its pace launching a private market for smaller firms interested in developing blockchain applications to explore more use cases.  Elsewhere in the interview, Bao also stressed in general that the Chinese government has taken a liberal approach towards innovations with its open market policy.  In fact, in a most recent announcement, the China State Government suggested that blockchain should be applied to establish a credibility system for the country's supply chain industry, signaling official support for development around the tech.

42400555,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK1go,1508958649,AMD CEO Sees 'Leveling Off' in Cryptocurrency Mining Demand,"Graphics card maker AMD reported a major sales jump in the third quarter of 2017 amid significant demand from the world's cryptocurrency miners.  On its Tuesday afternoon earnings call, the company reported $819 million in revenues from its computing and graphics division for the third quarter of 2017, a whopping 74 percent increase over the prior year's quarter.  While the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) have been traditionally used by video gamers, cryptocurrency enthusiasts are quickly snatching up the tools for mining ethereum and other coins. In a possible nod to that circumstance, AMD said the revenue was ""primarily driven"" by strong sales of its Radeon GPUs and Ryzen desktop processors – both of which are employed for crypto-mining.  In particular, AMD noted that sales of the Vega 56 and Vega 64 GPUs ramped up significantly during the quarter. These are among the most highly sought-after devices in the cryptocurrency market because of their significant processing power compared to other products.  With stagnant growth in its other core business segments, the surging GPU sales fueled a 26 percent year-over-year increase to a total revenue of $1.64 billion, making it the company’s highest-grossing quarter since 2011.  But while the numbers are eye-popping, the company's shareholders weren't impressed with the Q3 results.  AMD shares ultimately dropped 12 percent, from $14.25 at closing on Tuesday to as low as $12.43 in after hours trading. This coincides with the investment communities highly cautionary stance towards AMD's exposure to the volatile and potentially fleeting cryptocurrency market.  Plus, AMD forecasted a decrease in cryptocurrency-related revenues for the fourth quarter, expecting its fourth quarter revenues to decrease by 15 percent from the third quarter, give or take three percent.  As CEO Lisa Su said on the earning call:  ""In terms of the headwinds … we're also predicting that there will be some leveling-off of some of the cryptocurrency demand.""  Overall the message was mixed. While she issued bearish statements about the future of cryptocurrency mining as it relates to AMD's earnings, she also seemingly left the door open for other opportunities, although those seemed less clear.  ""There's also [a] commercial blockchain component that we believe is interesting and likely to continue into the medium term,"" she said.

According to Seoul-Yonhap News, Bank of Korea governor Lee Ju-yeol rejected the idea when asked on Monday whether it's possible to accept cryptocurrencies as legal fiat. The declaration is the latest official assessment on the tech following a ban on initial coin offerings issued in September.  ""Regulation (for virtual currencies) is appropriate because it is regarded as a commodity, not at the level of legal currency,"" Lee said during an audit of the government by the National Assembly, the country's legislative body.  ""It is not a situation for the Bank of Korea to take such an action at the present,"" he added.  That Lee would throw his weight behind legislative solutions to regulating the space is notable, given that work in this area has already advanced in some form.  Back in August, some lawmakers argued for tightened regulations to apply to cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea in light of the spiking trading volume since earlier this year. Last month, the country's financial regulator also took a notable move in cracking down on activities around the ICO funding model.  During the legislative session, Lee also acknowledged that the central bank could do more on research around both cryptocurrencies as well as blockchain more generally.

Announced this week, Tokyo Metropolitan Government is working with Japanese think tank Nomura Research Institute (NRI) on the ""Blockchain Business Camp Tokyo,"" the third iteration of a series of accelerator programs that have focused on emerging technologies. The accelerator program is seeking companies based outside of Japan that are focused on applications in areas like supply chain, Internet of Things and capital markets infrastructure, among others.  The application period for the accelerator will last until Nov. 24, officials announced late last week. Five companies are expected to join, and those selected will be notified sometime in December ahead of the program's commencement the following month. The accelerator will last until March, according to statements.  Officials suggested that it would work to advance the work being done by the chosen startups, including a plan to help them advertise their products and services in public spaces.  ""Furthermore, the technologies and services of the foreign companies participating in the program (about five companies) will be advertised for an extended period using digital signage located around Shinjuku and Tokyo stations in the heart of Tokyo, and support will be extended to foreign companies that decide to establish their business in Tokyo,"" the government said in a statement.  The development represents one of the more notable public-sector developments in Japan to date. This spring, lawmakers finalized and passed a law recognizing bitcoin as a kind of payment method, setting the stage for a number of companies in the country to trial accepting it in stores.  And last month, regulators issued licenses to 11 bitcoin exchanges – a move that reflected the proactive stance the government in Japan has taken toward the tech to date.

Early indications suggest so, as bitcoin cash is alternating gains with losses by trading in a tight range so far on Wednesday. At press time, the bitcoin cash-US dollar (BCH/USD) exchange rate is $328. As per CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency has lost just 2 percent in the last 24 hours.  Still, the lack of price movement may be encouraging for supporters.  BCH has stubbornly defended the $300 mark even amid the noise surrounding this week's bitcoin hard fork and the creation of another rival project – bitcoin gold – that adopted a same go-to-market strategy. For more than two weeks, dips below $300 have been quickly undone, still, a more sustainable break above $350 levels remains elusive.  More broadly, the cryptocurrency did rally above $400 on Oct. 17, largely on the back of a surge in Korean trading volumes. However, the spike was short-lived as prices fell back to $300 in the subsequent days.  It seems BCH is waiting for a stronger catalyst, and it could find some love if the conflict over bitcoin ahead of the Nov. 16 SegWit2x hard fork forces investors to switch out of BTC or diversify their holdings.  But while BCH waits for a stronger catalyst, the price action analysis anticipates better days ahead for the cryptocurrency.

Making the announcement today at a fintech event, the CEO of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Norman Chan Tak-lam, said the joint project with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will focus on a DLT proof-of-concept called the Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform (HKTFP).  Already having seen involvement from seven Hong Kong-based banks, the project is designed to digitize trade documents and reduce risk and fraud in the industry. Ultimately, the authorities plan the creation of a cross-border infrastructure that would serve as a bridge between HKTFP and a similar trade platform in Singapore.  According to the South China Morning Post, Chan described the initiative as a ""breakthrough' for distributed ledger technology, adding:  ""We firmly believe that the time has come for trade finance to move into the digital era.""  The CEO also announced a number of other schemes aimed to boost collaboration between Hong Kong and the Chinese city of Shenzhen, making it easier for fintech firms to operate in both jurisdictions.  The HKMA, along with Hong Kong's Law Society, Applied Science and Technology Research Institute and other entities, has also published a DLT white paper – research that addresses the potential of the tech while acknowledging that it ""cannot be a universal solution"" for all financial applications and innovations.  According to Chan, the research serves as an ""essential building block"" helping to drive innovations in finance, as well as contributing to the development of ""smart banking"" in Hong Kong.

42400560,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK1im,1508934640,"Back Above $5,500: Bitcoin Shrugs Off Fork with Price Rebound","Bitcoin is gathering fresh upside traction this Wednesday.  At press time, the bitcoin-US dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate is $5,540, up 3 percent from the intraday low of $5,376, but still down 2 percent on a daily basis. Week-on-week, BTC is trading largely unchanged, while on a monthly basis, it is up 41 percent.  But, it's perhaps the daily recovery that is most notable. While slight, it can be read as encouraging as it follows the news that bitcoin gold, a new publicly traded copy of the bitcoin network was made available to investors on exchanges yesterday. While the asset is not yet issued by developers, many exchanges made IOU versions of BTG available, putting sell pressure on the market and spurring buying elsewhere.  Yet, it does not seem that new bitcoin buyers are in a rush to exchange these phantom BTG tokens for fiat currency, and the recovery suggests more new money could be entering the BTC market at a price they feel is attractive.  So, is bitcoin heading back towards record highs?  The fact that search volumes remained low during yesterday's sell-off suggests the dip was largely seen as a healthy correction.  Google search volume  The above chart shows:  Search volumes registered a minor uptick yesterday, which could be associated with hard fork (bitcoin gold creation) and remained well below the level seen on Oct. 21 (the day bitcoin rallied to record highs).  Search volumes show bulls have little reason to worry, however, the price action analysis suggests bitcoin is not out of the woods yet.  Daily chart  Despite the recovery from $5,376, the short-term outlook remains murky, courtesy of the bearish price relative strength index (RSI) and price money flow index (MFI) divergence.  Only a convincing move above $5,867 would open doors for a rally to all-timeighs above $6,100.

42400542,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK1T2,1508932820,SPECTRE Creators Seek VC Backing for Blockchain-Free Cryptocurrency,"A veteran researcher behind two influential papers in the emerging field of crypto-economics is gearing up to launch a new cryptocurrency.  Revealed in an exclusive interview with CoinDesk, Yonatan Sompolinsky, co-author of the GHOST and SPECTRE protocol alongside Dr. Aviv Zohar, intends to release the as-yet unnamed project in late 2018. Based on his body of work, the project aims to solve one of the industry's biggest challenges: the speed at which transactions are disseminated and recorded by distributed ledger systems.  Founders of the project include SPECTRE co-author Yoad Lewenberg, and researcher Ethan Hileman, who worked with the team behind bitcoin privacy project TumbleBit. However, the team is not only equipped with developers, but also business experts – including Guy Corem, the former CEO of Israeli-based bitcoin mining firm Spondoolies-Tech, which raised more than $12 million in venture funding before shuttering operations.  Together, the team has founded a new startup called DAGlabs, which is said to be raising $15 million as part of a Series A round.  Yet, it's the vision for the project that is perhaps most notable, given how it intends to achieve its goal.  Rather than using a blockchain system, the public cryptocurrency will be among the first to operate via a system called a direct acyclic graph (DAG) – technology that Sompolinsky framed as a way to finally create a viable payments rail with distributed ledger concepts.  Sompolinsky told CoinDesk:  ""We want to change blockchain into blockDAG. Whether you buy coins or not, you should think about this technology as the next step, releasing the blockchain from the naivety of the chain structure. You will feel this is the natural step towards using a real system.""  For all the innovation, however, also notable is what the new cryptocurrency will share with bitcoin, today the largest and most valuable blockchain system, but one that is seen as increasingly less relevant for payments.  According to the DAGlabs team, the new cryptocurrency will use a proof-of-work mining algorithm in which anyone who purchases hardware can compete for its rewards. That said, Sompolinsky doesn't see bitcoin and other proof-of-work-based cryptocurrencies as competitors, so to speak.  ""I'm not competing with this entire plethora of new blockchains. We have a very boutique and niche and specific one and a well-defined one. We want to scale up layer one,"" he said.  Record of science  As told by Sompolinsky, the project is also a critique on the current state of blockchain development, which he views as having been held back by in-fighting.  In particular, he cited his experience with arguments about capacity levels on bitcoin, in which developers have often tried to push solutions to scalability in a way that did not change or update the first layer of the system – the blockchain itself. Referring to last year's Satoshi Roundtable summit, an invite-only event in Cancun, Mexico, he recalled an experience where he was shocked by the state of the conversation.  ""Cancun was an eye-opener for me. In Cancun, everyone was fighting about 1 MB to 2 MB ... no one was talking about increasing on-chain scalability by orders of magnitude,"" he said.  Sompolinsky framed the new cryptocurrency as a ""vehicle"" to enable researchers to take the next step in evaluating this line of exploration, one he argued will benefit from being tested under open market conditions.  But given the slate of open-source projects utilizing the initial coin offering (ICO) model as a way to solicit market funding, often for untested concepts, he was also keen to differentiate his project as one based on years of accumulated research.  ""There are not 800 projects that implement a concept like DAG. Very, very few, maybe less than five that I know of, try to scale up the layer one. There are not 800 projects that say we should abandon the concept of the chain in favor of a graph of blocks,"" he said.  Among those that do are IOTA and byteball, the former being one of the few cryptocurrencies yet to garner a total market capitalization of more than $1 billion.  When complete, the final network should appeal to anyone who wants to use a cryptocurrency with ""very fast confirmation and low fees,"" although that's not to say the concept has been perfected. According to Sompolinsky, there are still plenty of items up for debate.  For example, he is still open-minded about how he will structure any issuance, stating he is most strongly considering the model used by Zcash Company – the creators of the zcash protocol – wherein accredited investors are given tokens in stages for their support.  How it works  Still, even those experienced in the field of cryptocurrency may find the concept odd. After all, after the hype around cryptocurrency faded, the so-called ""underlying blockchain technology"" was often touted as the real secret sauce.  That notable researchers would stake a counter-thesis then, is of interest, though it's arguably been a development that has simply received less attention over the years.  Explored by Sompolinsky since his earliest work, the idea is that the process of ordering transactions into blocks, then selecting one to add to the chain, could be better optimized. In the SPECTRE concept, blocks are created at the rate of about 10 per second (as opposed to, say, ethereum where one block is created every 21 seconds). All of these blocks are referenced in a DAG, and multiple, interwoven threads of blocks are created. Then, the most valid transaction history is ""voted"" in by miners selecting the most inter-referential block graph.  And because this allows for such a high quantity of transactions to be performed on the network, the transaction history won't be permanently stored. Instead, transaction history will only be stored for a limited amount of time, and once it has been validated, will be removed.  Other barriers, including backbone congestions and bandwidth, could lie ahead, though. The team intends to address these potential issues by building incentives into the protocol that encourage participating agents to behave correctly.  Still, if the concept on the whole sounds familiar, you've likely come across it when reading about ethereum, which incorporated some of these ideas in how it rewards so-called ""uncle blocks"" – those that are not selected for inclusion in the ethereum blockchain, but still include useful work.  Although uncles aren't considered ultimately valid, they're still profitable to mine, and still get referenced in the blockchain ledger itself.  Indeed, what might be most notable about the SPECTRE project is that Sompolinsky's ideas have often proved to be of influence. For example, Casper, ethereum's hotly debated proof-of-stake protocol, derives its name from the GHOST protocol (a play on the ""Casper the Friendly Ghost"" cartoon series).  What's left  While the bones of the project are in place, there's still a few questions that need to be fleshed out before the cryptocurrency can be taken to market.  Currently under development, the final protocol will be introduced in an upcoming white paper called SPECTRE2. The tech will then begin testing in autumn next year, and by winter, the new cryptocurrency will be launched. Ongoing updates will then continue apace.  For one, DAGlabs has been working on combining the SPECTRE cryptocurrency with MimbleWimble, the natively private cryptocurrency that has been the cause of much excitement in the community. Further down the line, the platform also wants to allow DAG-based smart contracts to be written into the platform.  But the final step that DAGlabs is pivoting towards is perhaps as ambitious as the cryptocurrency itself. Once the team has established a functioning cryptocurrency, they intend to allow the DAG infrastructure to facilitate something along the lines of ""merged mining,"" which is when the underlying hardware can be used to support a number of cryptocurrencies simultaneously.  Still, it's the manner in which Sompolinsky will launch the project that he ultimately wants to call attention to – calling the years of research and engagement with the open-source community, a ""respectable"" path to market.  He concluded:  ""The easy path for us was to do an ICO; way easier than what we're doing now. We're going for the more respectable path of an equity.""

42400539,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK1S3,1508925622,Making Boring Sexy: NSD Sees Booming Interest for Blockchain Bonds,"Russia's largest clearing and settlement company has issued its first-ever live bond using blockchain, and already, issuers and brokers are wanting in on the action.  Initiated three weeks ago, the National Securities Depository (NSD) reproduced the financial instrument, a $10 million bond for shares in Russian telecom giant MegaFon, using smart contracts and the open-source Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. The bond is now expected to mature in about nine weeks (or three months after it was issued).  In an exclusive interview with CoinDesk, the NSD's head of decentralized solutions, Alexander Yakovlev, detailed what he characterized as the surprising demand for a trial he said is making ""boring"" paper bonds sexy. Following the formal announcement, the NSD has received 30 requests to repurpose the smart contract to issue other bonds.  Yakovlev said:  ""Issuers or brokers think blockchain can help transform these boring commercial bonds into some other product, because it will look different and taste different, so it's different.""  While the NSD hasn't recouped the money it put into the R&D just yet, Yakovley positioned the solution as one that will future-proof their processes for a time when clients demand the faster settlement times and enhanced transparency of a blockchain solution.    Copy and paste?        Built in coordination with the Russian central bank and in consultation with the NSD's legal and operations teams, the bond was intended to help create a new workflow for how such an issuance could be done in compliance with regulations.  And repurposing might very well be possible.  The MegaFon bond, which allowed the company to sell its shares to Raiffeisenbank Russia (a subsidiary of Raiffeisenbank International), was developed by California-based Altoros using smart contracts on the Hyperledger Fabric implementation.  At this early stage, the smart contract is a relatively simple bilateral agreement between the bank and MegaFon. Going forward, though, Altoros' head of blockchain practice, Oleg Abdrashitov, told CoinDesk that the ""blueprint"" could be used for more complicated derivatives sales that rely on third-party data supplied via a blockchain ""oracle.""  Abdrashitov said:  ""What they're asking now – new banks – is not only to participate in the same commercial paper issue, in the same use case, but they're asking whether they can reuse the same nodes and the same network, to build their own smart contracts for some other products and some other businesses.""  Publicity built in  But there's more behind this demand than the routine promise for faster, cheaper and more transparent financial transactions.  While the NSD's blockchain developers have long touted these benefits as appealing to international investors, the real driving force behind the demand, according to NSD director Artem Duvanov, is the built-in publicity that comes with blockchain experimentation.  In interview, Duvanov echoed comments made on stage at Sibos last week by NSD CIO Sergey Putyatinskiy, who joked that blockchain's ability to generate headlines could also disrupt public relations agencies.  According to Duvanev, stock issuers and brokers evaluating the cost of a marketing campaign to attract interest to investment opportunities are increasingly deciding that it's cheaper to issue something real on a blockchain to attract attention.  The result, Duvanev hopes, could be an entirely new revenue stream for value-added services built around blockchain-based assets.  He said:  ""What is now offered is just some basic service. You can use us to issue and settle, but that's a really basic service. We can do it more convenient, more digitized, and to include it in a bigger service, that we would definitely charge money for.""

42400553,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK1eq,1508922028,Fraudsters Post Fake Poloniex Cryptocurrency Trading Apps to Google Store,"Security researchers have discovered at least three fraudulent apps on the Google Play store purportedly tied to the Poloniex cryptocurrency exchange.  An article posted on IT security firm ESET’s news site We Live Security details how two of the apps, respectively called ""Poloniex"" and ""Poloniex Exchange,"" were put onto the Android app service and downloaded more than 5,500 times before being removed. Reportedly, Poloniex does not have an official Android app.  The news (as well as the existence of the apps) highlights the cybersecurity pitfalls of cryptocurrency, as the high-dollar value of some digital assets has drawn the attention of would-be fraudsters. In this case, the apps asked Poloniex users to enter their account credentials, granting the fraudsters access to the victim's emails – thus giving them the ability to alter passwords and delete any evidence of outbound transactions.  ESET wrote in the article:  ""This means the attackers can carry out transactions on the user's behalf, change their settings, or even lock them out of their account by changing their password.""  The researchers could not say how many people may have been adversely affected by the fake apps. The article notes that Poloniex allows users to enable 2-factor authentication (2FA) to protect their accounts from this type of attack. If a user has 2FA enabled, the attackers would not be able to log into an account even with the appropriate credentials.  The first app, Poloniex, was on Google Play for about three weeks and saw 5,000 downloads before being taken down on Sept. 19, 2017. The second was in the store for a few days and was downloaded 500 times until it, too, was removed.  As of press time, a third app – ""Poloniex - Bitcoin/Digital Asset Exchange"" is still available on the Play store, with at least 1,000 downloads to date.

Speaking at an interview with the Financial Times, the promotional speaker, former financier and convicted stock fraudster said that he expects projects utilizing the blockchain funding model – through which cryptographic tokens are sold in order to fund a newly developed network – will ""blow up in so many peoples' faces.""  Noting his own involvement with financial fraud, Belfort claimed that what's happening around ICOs today is ""far worse than anything I was ever doing.""  Belfort plead guilty to money laundering and stock manipulation charges in 1999, going on to write about his experiences in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" (which later became an Academy Award-winning film starring Leonardo DiCaprio).  He went on to say:  ""Promoters are perpetuating a massive scam of the highest order on everyone. Probably 85 percent of people out there don't have bad intentions, but the problem is, if five or 10 per cent are trying to scam you, it's a disaster.""  Belfort's comments come weeks after he threw his support behind JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who declared that, in his view, bitcoin is a ""fraud"" that will ultimately be targeted by regulators.

42427972,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL50Th,1508904042,DEA Report: Bitcoin Used for Trade-Based Money Laundering,"A new report from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) claims that bitcoin is being used to facilitate trade-based money laundering (TBML) schemes.  Published by the Department of Justice, the reporthttps://www.dea.gov/docs/DIR-040-17_2017-NDTA.pdf offers a broad overview of the U.S. government's efforts to police the illicit drug trade. Included in the study, however, is a segment on cryptocurrencies, which notably states that criminals who launder funds through trading operations are using bitcoin, particularly firms based in China.  The DEA wrote:  ""...many China-based firms manufacturing goods used in [trade-based money laundering] schemes now prefer to accept bitcoin. Bitcoin is widely popular in China because it can be used to anonymously transfer value overseas, circumventing China's capital controls.""  The claim aside, the report doesn't contain any specific figures on how much money is being laundered through this means. But it does detail efforts to obtain bitcoin holdings through regulated exchanges, stating that China-based groups prefer using the cryptocurrency in an effort to bypass capital controls.  Elsewhere in that section, the paper's authors argue that over-the-counter (OTC) bitcoin brokers are helping to facilitate these cross-border transactions – a trend they write will continue.  ""The increasing use of OTC bitcoin brokers, who are capable of transferring millions of dollars in bitcoin across international borders, as part of a capital flight scheme is expected to continue to intertwine criminal money laundering networks with capital flight,"" the report states.

42427985,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL50ph,1508896030,Tezos Founders on ICO Controversy: 'This Will Blow Over',"They didn't take questions from the audience, nor did they say much, but many people in the crowd were amazed that Kathleen and Arthur Breitman took the stage at all.  In their first public appearance since a flurry of news stories documenting the internal power struggles impacting their blockchain project, Tezos, the married couple and business partners projected confidence that despite the governance issues, their technology will endure.  ""Development is moving forward,"" Kathleen Breitman said during their 20-minute onstage interview at Money2020 in Las Vegas Tuesday afternoon.  Onstage, she insisted that there was no critical underlying issue with the project itself – notwithstanding the couple's public feud with Johann Gevers, the president of the Swiss-based non-profit foundation created to foster the development and adoption of the Tezos protocol.  ""This will blow over once the board meets in a few days,"" she said, adding that the foundation's board of trustees is conducting an internal investigation to decide whether Gevers will remain.  Still, she acknowledged the difficulties of the situation:  ""I mean, it stinks. It stinks. We're both really embarrassed about the situation. But we trust the process that we put in place, and I think it will be resolved in due course.""  Her husband Arthur had a succinct message for the backers of the project, who are still waiting to receive Tezos tokens after the company sold $232 million worth of the cryptocurrency in July, stating: ""Bear with me.""  Hot spotlight  Stepping back, the Breitmans previously accused Gevers of self-dealing, while he, in turn, has accused them of assassinating his character and attempting an illegal coup.  The situation has turned the couple into poster children for the controversies surrounding the ICO market – a hot topic given the amount of money raised via the offerings and the broader legal questions about whether some token sales may constitute securities offerings.  On the sidelines of the conference, many attendees wondered if the Breitmans' legal counsel had advised them not to go through with the scheduled appearance. Either way, onstage, the couple was a bit more diplomatic when talking about their adversary. But only a bit.  Gevers ""is probably not a good fit for the project,"" Arthur Breitman said. ""I think he did some things which were bad, and honestly it would be better for the project at this point if he walked away.""  Despite the situation, much of the conversation was relatively light.  Although, the discussion turned more serious when moderator Meltem Demirors, director of development at Digital Currency Group, and herself a Tezos backer, asked why the project ended up raising more than 20 times the $10 million the couple had initially envisioned seeking in September 2016.  In response, the Breitmans cited the rising prices of ether, bitcoin and other tokens in 2017, as well as the enthusiastic response to their project.  Early in the session, the Breitmans said that one of the reasons they started the project was to solve the governance challenges faced by bitcoin.  Later, during the discussion of their own governance problems, Kathleen smiled and told the audience:  ""We appreciate the irony of the situation.""
