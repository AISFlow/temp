His recent comment also echoes the reservation that the crypto founder has about the potential launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. TradFi Could Lead To Bitcoin’s Downfall In his last article for the year, Hayes stated that TradFi asset managers would “completely destroy Bitcoin” if the ETFs managed by them were a huge success. He made this assertion as he alluded to Bitcoin’s uniqueness. Hayes mentioned that the foremost crypto token is different from “every other monetary instrument humanity has ever used.” Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Massive 99% BNB Price Crash To $2 Due to Bitcoin’s uniqueness, Hayes believes that it wasn’t created to be in the hands of these asset managers. As such, they could end up destroying the crypto token, especially in a world where the world’s largest asset managers end up holding all the Bitcoin in circulation. If that were to happen, these firms would end up storing these crypto tokens, which shouldn’t be so in Hayes’ opinion. The BitMEX co-founder noted that Bitcoin “only exists if it moves” and that it will “die” if it isn’t used. His stance stems from the fact that he sees Bitcoin more as an asset that is meant to be actively traded rather than just being a store of value. He also highlighted the fact that the Bitcoin network would also die if this were to happen. Miners are known to earn transaction fees from the network being utilized. However, if these tokens were no longer traded but all stored up, these miners would have no choice but to wind up their operations. Without these miners, “the network dies, and Bitcoin vanishes,” Hayes asserted. BTC maintains $43,000 level | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Hayes’ Reservations About A Spot Bitcoin ETF Arthur Hayes’ latest comment comes ahead of a potential approval of the pending Spot Bitcoin ETF applications. The former BitMEX CEO has previously made his reservations known about these funds and their issuers. Then, he mentioned that these TradFi institutions weren’t bullish on Bitcoin but were simply making this move to become “crypto gatekeepers.” Related Reading: Here Are The Hottest Altcoins To Buy As The Bull Market Returns – Santiment Hayes also went as far as to discuss how these firms’ interest in Bitcoin goes against Satoshi’s vision of a decentralized system. However, unlike Hayes, some are looking to look at the bright side and how institutional interest in the foremost cryptocurrency can help with mainstream adoption. Bloomberg Analyst Eric Balchunas had once touched on the importance of these Spot Bitcoin ETFs, especially considering that many could just choose to hold Bitcoin instead. In his opinion, these ETFs are important because of the convenience they provide investors. Meanwhile, others are excited about the amount of capital that could flow in when these ETFs get approved.

This has led to concerns that the rally might be over, a theory that is boosted by the recent action of the largest holders of the crypto token. Bitcoin Whales Offload Some BTC Holdings In a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted a report from the market intelligence platform Santiment, which showed that Bitcoin whales had sold around 50,000 BTC over the past week. This has raised eyebrows as many speculate why these whales are offloading some of their Bitcoin holdings. Related Reading: Former Director Says Ripple Can Burn 40 Billion XRP In Escrow, How Will This Affect Price? Coincidentally, these sales follow a similar trend from institutional investors as CoinShares’ latest weekly report noted that there were minor outflows from digital asset funds last week. These funds are said to have seen an outflow totaling $16 million. However, if the asset manager’s report is anything to go by, then there should be no cause for concern. CoinShares mentioned that the outflows seen from the digital asset investment funds are more likely to be related to profit-taking rather than a swing in sentiment. As such, one could also assume that this is the sentiment among the whales that made this recent Bitcoin sell-off. This is also very plausible, considering that Santiment recently reported that 89% of BTC’s total supply is in profit. Meanwhile, BTC is seeing an inflow of investors, as Santiment reported that the amount of non-zero Bitcoin addresses is up to 916.8 million. Many seem to be looking to get in on the flagship cryptocurrency as approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF looms, and the BTC Halving draws near. BTC price at $43,600 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com BTC To Rise Above $50,000 By End Of January While BTC seems to be cooling off, there is reason to believe that the rally isn’t over, as it could rise above $50,000 by the end of January 2024.

Related Reading: Solana Flips BNB To Become 4th-Largest Crypto, Is Ethereum Next Matrixport noted that they drew parallels to historical instances while making this price prediction.

DOGE transfers into crypto exchanges have seen an uptick in the past few days, as the crypto continues to struggle to keep up pace compared to other top cryptocurrencies. However, according to Whale Alerts, 112 million DOGE which was valued at roughly $10.4 million at the time of the transfer, was sent from Robinhood into a private wallet. Related Reading: Social Frenzy: Stacks (STX) Hits 8-Month High, But It Unveiled An Intriguing Twist Massive Dogecoin Transfer Out Of Robinhood According to Whale Alerts, the 112 million DOGE tokens were transferred from the Robinhood-linked address “DHQsfy” into the private address “DEndnp.” The tokens were then transferred to another private wallet address “DF8jRK” four hours later. A further look through on-chain transaction data shows earlier large DOGE transactions between the Robinhood address and private wallet “DEndnp.” On Dec 21, 17.5 million DOGE tokens made their way from Robinhood into “DEndnp.”. At the time of the transaction, this tranche of coins was worth approximately $1.6 million. Again, the tokens were then transferred to “DF8jRK” four hours later. At the time of writing, “DF8jRK” holds 111 million DOGE tokens, and the pattern of transfers points to the transactions being made by the same entity. On the other hand, various social media posts from Whale Alerts have shown large DOGE transfers from private addresses into Robinhood over the week. On December 18, a single transaction of over $7 million worth of DOGE was sent into Robinhood. DOGE market cap currently at $13.189 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Crypto whales, or investors holding very large amounts, are always worth keeping an eye on. When whales make big moves, it often means something. They also tend to show general sentiment among whales. However, in this case, $10 million worth of Dogecoin exiting Robinhood could signal that the whale is opting to keep the tokens in self-custody in anticipation of a long-awaited DOGE price surge. Future Outlook For Dogecoin Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.09312, over a newly found support at the $0.092 level. DOGE went on a run earlier in the month that saw its price reach a yearly high of $0.0151 on December 11. This growth has since slowed down, and DOGE is now down by %0.6 in a 7-day timeframe. Related Reading: BONK Crashes 31% After A Solid Month – Is the Success Story Ending? DOGE whales have increased their holdings by a substantial amount in the past month. According to IntoTheBlock’s Balance By Holdings metric, the balance of addresses holding between $100,000 to $1 million, $1 million to $10 million, and more than $10 million worth of DOGE has increased by 23.28%, 16.41%, and 27% in the past 30 days. Collectively, these large addresses have increased their holdings by $1.32 billion since December 1. Dogecoin is currently trading 87% below its all-time high of $0.74. As a meme token, DOGE’s value is mostly tied to hype among traders, particularly retail investors. If the current bullish momentum among DOGE whales rolls over into retail investors, we could see the cryptocurrency’s strong bullish run in 2024. The first step in its journey to a new high is to find a strong footing over the $0.1 price level.

21687585,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=566709,1703340023,Analyst Points To Increasing Caution In Bitcoin Market Despite Price Surge,"In the past week, Bitcoin recorded an overall positive performance, gaining by 3.45%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. This price rise adds to BTC’s bullish form in the last 30 days, during which the maiden cryptocurrency has surged by 16.78%. However, despite this market uptick, there appears to be a growing trend of caution among Bitcoin traders, indicating fear of a potential price dump. Related Reading: Matrixport Foresees Bitcoin Hitting $50,000 Price Mark: Here’s When Analyst Highlights Evidence Of Growing Caution In The Bitcoin Market In an X Post on Saturday, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared an interesting observation regarding the Bitcoin market with his 37,000 followers. According to Martinez, there is a significant decrease in the estimated leverage ratio in the BTC market across all exchanges. This indicates that traders are reducing their leverage risk and are now treading carefully in the BTC market, even amidst the current price gain. For context, leverage is a trading function that allows users to borrow funds in order to increase the size of a position beyond what would be possible with one’s own capital alone. Leverage allows traders to amplify their profits potentially, albeit it also comes with increased risk. Now, the Estimated Leverage Ratio is a metric that quantifies the extent to which traders in the market are using leverage. Thus, a decreased estimated leverage ratio implies that traders are reducing the amount of borrowed funds relative to their own capital in their positions. In other words, they are decreasing the level of leverage they are using, which can be seen as a sign of caution among traders against a potential market dump. The BTC market, which is currently on an uptrend, has witnessed similar puzzling events recently. On Friday, NewsBTC reported that Bitcoin whales sold 50,000 BTC worth $2.2 billion in the last week. All these movements are indicative of investors preparing for a possible bearish trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Approaches Breakout – Why BTC Could Rally 10% BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades around $43,626, with a 0.09% decline in the last day. Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume is significantly down by 29.63% and is currently valued at $17.22 billion. For now, there is no clear indicative danger to BTC’s bullish form. Albeit, there is a high level of anticipation in regard to a potential approval order of the spot Bitcoin ETF in January. While many analysts predict a spot Bitcoin ETF will lead to increased demand for Bitcoin, others are fearful of turning the maiden cryptocurrency into a state-controlled financial asset. However, Bitget chief analyst Ryan Lee anticipates Bitcoin to trade between $32,000 – $50,000 depending on the effects of this investment fund.

The net present value of our expected future price would equal our estimated intrinsic value today. Estimating a cryptoasset’s price ceiling, or the degree to which the actual price could exceed the price floor, is more challenging because it depends on demand, which entails a large degree of uncertainty. A few foundational microeconomic assumptions and a discounted cash flow ((DCF)) framework can help inform crypto buy and sell decisions. “Crypto’s Unanswered Question: At What Price?” by Franklin J. Parker, CFA, highlights a conversation I often have with other charterholders, investors, and clients. These discussions have led to both valuable thought exercises and rousing debates. I am not a crypto expert and certainly not a crypto “bro.” I have no strong opinion on whether cryptoassets are undervalued or overvalued, the future of money and commerce or a fad that we’ll all look back on amusingly. Nevertheless, I believe crypto investors can employ a logical valuation framework by which they can make reasonable and informed crypto investment decisions. By applying a discounted cash flow ((DCF)) model, relying on microeconomic principles as inputs, and using gold and other commodities as guides, we can define a range of prices at which we could expect a reasonable, risk-adjusted rate of return over a given time horizon for a particular cryptoasset. Because cryptoasset prices are directly observable, using a DCF valuation framework, we only need to estimate a future price or range of future prices for a particular cryptoasset, which we can discount back to the present at a required cost of capital. The net present value of our expected future price would equal our estimated intrinsic value today. By comparing that to spot prices, we can make our buy and sell decisions. Admittedly, some elements of this future price estimation process involve a high degree of uncertainty, but others can be reasonably estimated with a modest amount of effort. For example, we know that, over the long run, profit-maximizing businesses will only produce if the marginal revenue exceeds the marginal cost to produce. As such, the marginal cost of mining a crypto coin sets a floor price around which supply will fluctuate. In the case of cryptoassets, the variable costs are reasonably simple to assess — computing costs / energy consumption, taxes, and transaction fees — and because computers can be turned on and off quickly, mining activities can be adjusted quickly depending on price fluctuations. In fact, we can observe this quick response function at work when we juxtapose hash rates over spot prices or estimated mining profitability. Accounting for pre-ordained “halvings” in the mining algorithm, estimating future variable costs associated with cryptoassets, is relatively simple and straightforward. Moreover, crypto miners presumably require a reasonable return on their physical capital investment over time, so we must also include an estimate for the future cost of hardware as well as other capital and fixed costs. With estimates for variable costs, fixed costs, and an assumed required cost of capital for the miners, we can calculate the range of prices at which a cryptoasset will be mined, thus setting the price floor at which we’d expect it to trade. Estimating a cryptoasset’s price ceiling, or the degree to which the actual price could exceed the price floor, is more challenging because it depends on demand, which entails a large degree of uncertainty. But all investments involve uncertainty, and investors employ various logical approaches to work through it. For example, we can assess the various demand drivers that influence cryptoasset owners by evaluating it as money. Like gold, cryptoassets are generally divisible into smaller units, countable and fungible (unit of account), used by some to hedge against inflation (store of value), and used to buy and sell goods (medium of exchange). As such, cryptoassets generally meet the criteria for the definition of money, which allows us to measure a cryptocurrency’s demand based on its value as money and, more specifically, its utility in these use cases. As a store of value, a cryptoasset may increase in price as confidence in fiat currency collapses or fears of inflation or hyperinflation spike. As a medium of exchange, a cryptoasset may rise in value the more it is used in domestic and international commerce as a method of buying and selling goods and services. We could incorporate a demand component based on the attractiveness of its anonymity — which has utility for both legal and illicit purposes — and we could even incorporate our expectations about how central banks might use cryptoassets to diversify their holdings in the future. A cryptoasset’s value across these various use cases would influence demand, and with it, the price of the cryptoasset itself. Presumably, the sum of a cryptoasset’s utility exceeds its cost and cryptoassets would continue to exist. The point is that, as with all investments, some assumptions must be made about future conditions, and as with gold, some of the key assumptions involve potential demand. Unlike gold, which has a long history, and, therefore, offers some sense for what demand will reasonably look like from various users, cryptoassets lack a long history of use and demand; its story as money is still being written. Nevertheless, this is where the individual assumptions of the investor come into play: their own personal risk tolerance, their investment goals, objectives, and required rate of return, and, ultimately, their own personal determination about the potential risk and potential return, and whether, given their expectations for risk and return, a cryptoasset is an attractive investment. We may all argue about the inputs and assumptions that go into the framework, but that is, after all, exactly what makes financial markets work; the interaction of millions of investors applying their own assumptions and expectations to various investment opportunities using a logical framework in order to avoid speculation. Which brings me to my answer to Parker’s unanswered question: “At What Price?” I don’t know at what price, but I know how someone who wants to answer that question could answer it for themselves.

21683166,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=566678,1703329259,Rumbling Ahead: Avalanche (AVAX) Set To Surge 20% Before Cooling Off – Details,"The price of Avalanche (AVAX) has been steadily rising leading up to the holiday season. Consequently, in just over two months, the altcoin has more than quintupled in value. In any case, the price of AVAX still has more potential than most other cryptocurrencies, which have seen rises of about 300% over the same time frame. Investors and aficionados are keeping a careful eye on whether AVAX may reach this milestone before the end of the current year as the cryptocurrency makes steady progress toward the coveted $50 mark, a level it has not hit since May 2022. AVAX Surges: From Resistance Break To $50 Anticipation At the time of writing, AVAX was trading at $45.59, down 2.1% in the last seven days, but sustained a 6.7% rally in the last week, data from Coingecko shows. With a market valuation of more than $17 billion, the altcoin has become one of the largest in the business thanks to its continuous rise. Related Reading: Social Frenzy: Stacks (STX) Hits 8-Month High, But It Unveiled An Intriguing Twist The value of the cryptocurrency has increased dramatically since October, when it was trading at a low of $8.50. With only two months to go, AVAX surged by more than 400%, setting a new annual high of $46.50 and sparking anticipation that it would hit $50 in the remaining days of the year. AVAX achieved a major breakthrough by breaking away from a falling resistance trend line that had held for 750 days since its all-time high, which propelled this incredible ascension. This break free from the established trend line represented a significant technical advancement and was also a major factor in quickening the pace of AVAX’s price rise. AVAX market cap currently at $16.563 billion. Chart: TradingView.com AVAX’s solid run so far is attributable to a number of favorable factors driving the broader cryptocurrency market. Macroeconomically, the recent drop in inflation rates and signs of probable interest rate reductions by the Federal Reserve and other central banks in 2024 present a good climate for alternative assets like AVAX. AVAX’s Potential Amid ETF Hope, Market Optimism Moreover, there is hope that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would approve a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). If this happens, it may pave the way for the introduction of other cryptocurrency ETFs, such as those associated with Avalanche.

The crypto fear and greed index has risen to 75, signifying a favorable feeling, demonstrating the industry’s momentum. Historical data indicates that tokens like as AVAX have a tendency to perform well and remain resilient during times of market optimism, which may indicate additional upward movement in the present market environment. Even with AVAX’s remarkable price surge, changes in Bitcoin’s price still have an impact. If Bitcoin falls for any reason, the price of Avalanche is probably going to follow. #Avalanche $Avax 1w On track! 👌 pic.twitter.com/pDM4hWzE7S — FLASH (@THEFLASHTRADING) December 21, 2023 Meanwhile, crypto analysts on X believe that the trend is likely to go upward. With a target price of $65, Flash has a bullish projection. His bullish view stems from a breakaway from a long-term trend and a move over a horizontal resistance zone. Additionally, Bluntz Capital tweeted a bullish wave count that suggests the price of AVAX will finish the fifth and final wave close to $55. Meanwhile, the price of AVAX stays above the weekly support level at $40 and advances into the resistance zone, which is located between $51 and $55. When compared to the current price of $45.49, this move would represent a gain of around 20%. With momentum growing and significant changes expected in the cryptocurrency scene, Avalanche (AVAX) could experience a substantial % surge before a cooldown. The interplay of economic factors, regulations, and market sentiment creates an engaging story for both AVAX enthusiasts and investors.

Thanks to this recent price growth, Optimism has seen its native token OP lay a serious claim to a place within the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. However, it seems that the Optimism price movement may soon be turning bearish following the appearance of a sell signal on the price chart. Indicator That Preceded 80% Rally Turns Bearish, Analyst Says In a recent post on the X platform, crypto analyst Ali Martinez sounded the sell alarm for the OP token. According to the popular crypto pundit, the Optimism price might be in the best range for investors to cash in on their profits. The reasoning behind this forecast revolves around the TD (Tom DeMark) sequential indicator. Based on Martinez’s analysis, the indicator is currently flashing a sell signal on Optimism’s 12-hour price chart. Related Reading: Solana Saga Orders Scrapped As $30 Million BONK Token Package Overshadows Device’s Value The crypto analyst highlighted that a buy signal from the TD sequential indicator preceded a substantial surge in Optimism price earlier in December. And this adds even more weight to the possibility of a bearish turnaround following a sell alarm from the indicator. Martinez advised investors to think about taking profits right away, given that the OP price may decline and mirror the size of the initial bullish upswing. This projection comes during an exhilarating positive run for OP, putting the altcoin’s bullish trajectory in jeopardy. Optimism Price And Network Growth As of this writing, the Optimism price stands at $3.37, reflecting an almost 34% price increase in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the value of the cryptocurrency has soared by more than 55% in the past week. The OP coin looks set to end the year as one of the 30 largest cryptocurrencies in the sector, with its market cap recently surpassing $3 billion. This positive performance of the token – in such a short time span – only underscores the increased rate of network growth. Related Reading: Will Inscriptions On Polkadot Push DOT Prices Back Above $10? According to recent data from IntoTheBlock, the Optimism network boasts more than 5.9 million addresses with a balance. This represents a nearly 400% surge from 1.2 million in January 2023. Growth of this caliber and magnitude suggests increased confidence, adoption, and usage of the Optimism network. And if this positive trend is anything to go by, there is a chance the Optimism price won’t be down for long – if the current bearish projection does come true.

The positive growth within the Solana ecosystem has resulted in a surge in demand for the flagship mobile device, Solana Saga. However, the Solana Mobile team recently addressed challenges in meeting the “overwhelming demand” and explained order cancellations and inventory management issues. Solana Mobile Faces Inventory Mishap Over the past month, SOL has seen a significant uptrend, inching closer to the $100 mark, a level not reached since April 2022. Additionally, Bonk has experienced an extraordinary surge reaching a trading value of $0.00001896. Given these developments and the social buzz within the blockchain and its mobile device, the Solana Mobile team confirmed that their limited inventory of 20,000 devices worldwide has sold out, with both the US and EU markets experiencing high demand. Related Reading: Social Frenzy: Stacks (STX) Hits 8-Month High, But It Unveiled An Intriguing Twist According to a recent statement on X (formerly Twitter), in the process of fulfilling orders, the Solana Mobile team encountered an “inventory management issue” with their third-party distributor. This issue resulted in an inaccurate representation of the available inventory. Consequently, the team was unable to fulfill orders placed after the inventory was depleted. Additionally, orders suspected of suspicious activity, such as excessive device orders or payment risks, were flagged and subsequently canceled. According to the announcement, the objective behind these measures is to ensure that as many users as possible can enjoy the Solana Saga mobile device. Customers affected by the order cancellations have been promptly notified, and they will receive refunds within the coming days. Solana’s DEX Volume Overtakes Ethereum And Arbitrum The Solana ecosystem, together with its native token SOL, has recently achieved significant milestones. Notably, Solana’s 24-hour decentralized exchange (DEX) volume has exceeded that of Ethereum (ETH) and Arbitrum (ARB) combined, surpassing the $2 billion mark. Additionally, Solana has emerged as the third-largest altcoin (only behind BNB) by market capitalization. These achievements reflect the growing popularity and success of Solana within the cryptocurrency market. According to Token Terminal data, SOL’s market cap (circulating) stands at $41.05 billion, reflecting a remarkable increase of 46.98%, flipping XRP’s market cap by over $7 billion. Related Reading: Here Are The Hottest Altcoins To Buy As The Bull Market Returns – Santiment The revenue generated has also witnessed substantial growth, with an 80.43% increase to $2.39 million. Furthermore, SOL’s fully diluted market cap has reached $54.31 billion, showcasing a significant rise of 45.60%. The revenue generated on the Solana platform, when annualized, amounts to an impressive $29.13 million, signifying a substantial increase of 94.75%. Examining SOL’s financial ratios, the price-to-fully diluted ratio stands at 796.78x, indicating the market’s high expectations for future growth.

On Thursday, XRP’s trading volume plummeted to levels not seen in the past six years, a development that has raised eyebrows among crypto enthusiasts. On this day, December 21st, #XRP : pic.twitter.com/ptHRTpkEeE — WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman) December 22, 2023 Just XRP Or Industry-Wide Slump In Trade Volumes? Reputed lawyer and XRP advocate, Bill Morgan, took to X (formerly Twitter) to shed light on this concerning trend highlighted by WrathKahneman. According to WrathKahneman, the trading volume of XRP on December 21 stood at approximately 1.9 billion, a stark contrast to the $2.4 billion witnessed in 2022 and drastically lower than $19.3 billion recorded in 2020. What is most interesting or concerning about those figures is the daily XRP volume is lower on this day for this year and not this day in any of the previous 6 years. https://t.co/oQpr7avC54 — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) December 22, 2023 This decline has sparked a debate over the implications for the token’s market dynamics and investor sentiment. While the decline in XRP’s trade volume has become a focal point for discussions, it is important to note that this trend isn’t isolated to XRP alone. Related Reading: XRP And XLM In Lockstep? Expert Sheds Light On Their Surprising Price Synchronization Mr. Huber, a recognized figure in the crypto world, pointed out that leading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are also experiencing similar plunge in trade volumes. This broader market trend suggests a possible shift in the trading activities across the crypto landscape. Media reports corroborates Mr. Huber’s assertion, indicating that Bitcoin’s trade volume as of August 28, 2023, had reached its lowest in four years. This pattern, reflected across multiple major cryptocurrencies, hints at a more complex market dynamic that extends beyond XRP. XRP’s Current Market Performance Despite the concerns over trading volume, XRP has exhibited resilience in its market price. Over the past 24 hours, the digital asset has seen a near 1% increase, with its trading price hovering around $0.61. Although it experienced a 4.6% decline over the past two weeks, XRP’s performance over the past month shows a 3.8% increase. Currently, its trading volume has continued to decline further standing at about $1.3 billion, maintaining a relatively steady state compared to last Friday’s $1.2 billion. Furthermore, Mr. Huber’s observation that the downturn in trading volume isn’t unique to XRP was echoed by another user, MoonLambo on X. This user, responding to Bill Morgan’s post highlighting what could be either interesting or concerning, supported Mr. Huber’s view by adding, “I disagree.” MoonLambo disclosed that there is nothing concerning and that the plunging trading volume is not unusual or worrying. They point out that considering the vast number of days (around 2,200) over the past six years, focusing on just six specific days’ data is too narrow to draw meaningful conclusions. According to their analysis of the all-time XRP/USD price chart, they note a consistent pattern where both XRP’s price and trade volume increase as market activity heats up. This pattern has been observed consistently over a decade, not only for XRP but also for other major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. Related Reading: XRP Price Could Be Soon The Next One To Rally – Here’s Why MoonLambo further assert that the current state of XRP’s volume is typical and expect a significant increase in trade volume when XRP experiences its next market rally. I disagree. This is not the least bit concerning. Nearly 2,200 days have passed in the last 6 years. Each day is a data point, and you’re only looking at 6 data points while ignoring the rest.

Bitcoin Whales Have Distributed Around 50,000 BTC In Past Week As pointed out by an analyst in a post on X, the BTC whales have been participating in some selling over the past week. The relevant indicator here is the “Supply Distribution” metric from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, which tells us about the total amount of Bitcoin that the different investor groups are carrying in their combined wallets currently. In the context of the current discussion, “whale” entities are of interest. These humongous investors are typically defined to be the addresses who carry between 1,000 to 10,000 BTC. Related Reading: Polygon Breaks Through $0.85, Is A Move To New Highs Next? At the current exchange rate of the asset, this range converts to about $43.8 million at the lower end and $438 million at the upper limit. Due to the sheer scale of their holdings, the whales can carry some influence, and therefore, they can be entities worth tracking on the blockchain. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Supply Distribution specifically for these large holders over the past month: The value of the indicator appears to have plunged in recent days | Source: @ali_charts on X As displayed in the above graph, the supply held by the Bitcoin whales has been showing a decline in the past week, after remaining stagnant for the preceding few weeks. Most of the selling had come while BTC was still trading at the recent lows, suggesting that these were whales who had been panicking after BTC had failed its recovery run towards $44,000. In total, these humongous investors have shed about 50,000 BTC from their combined wallets during this latest selloff, which is worth almost $2.2 billion right now. Despite this selling, Bitcoin has gone on to hit another local bottom and make a recovery push again, this time actually making a retest of the $44,000 level (although the asset has slumped again since then, as it’s now trading below the mark once more). Another analyst has also given a whale selling alert in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, citing the data for the “exchange inflow mean,” which is an indicator that measures the mean amount of Bitcoin that’s being transferred to centralized exchanges. Looks like the value of the metric has been quite high recently | Source: CryptoQuant Exchange inflows can be a sign of selling as investors generally use these platforms for this purpose.

21666916,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=566616,1703289639,"Countdown To Bitcoin ETF 2024 Decision: Traders Employ Hedging Tactics, Bloomberg Unveils","As the long-awaited deadline for a positive or negative decision on spot Bitcoin ETF applications approaches, Bloomberg reports that the BTC options market is seeing increased hedging activity as traders prepare for a crucial decision on January 10th. The report indicates a surge in open interest for put options expiring on Jan. 12, suggesting that market participants are taking steps to mitigate potential losses in the event of a negative verdict by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding these index funds holding the cryptocurrency. Market Readies For Bitcoin ETF Verdict The Bloomberg report highlights that the open interest for put options, which allow holders to sell Bitcoin, has seen a significant increase for contracts expiring on January 12. This surge in open interest has resulted in a higher put-to-call ratio for these specific options compared to contracts with expiration dates further out from the January 10 deadline.

The put-to-call ratio, considered a measure of overall market sentiment, stands at 0.67 for the January 12 options contracts, indicating a more cautious approach among traders. Ryan Kim, head of derivatives at FalconX, suggests that leveraged/speculative traders are employing Bitcoin put options to protect their leveraged longs, anticipating significant price movements in either direction. The higher put-call ratio for January 12 options further reflects the market’s desire for protection against a potential negative decision. The surge in open interest for put options expiring on January 12 indicates a growing need for protection in case of an unfavorable ruling. While Bitcoin’s rally has softened the impact of its 2022 decline, market expectations for ETF approval may already be priced in, posing potential risks for the market. BTC’s Price Resistance And Potential Dip Bitcoin has experienced a remarkable rally this year, with expectations for ETF approval driving its price up by more than 60% since mid-October. However, the Bloomberg report suggests that the surge in demand for the anticipated ETFs may already be factored into the token’s price, potentially exposing the market to a “sell the news” scenario in the second week of January.

Bitcoin is currently trading at $43,400, experiencing a 1% decline over the past 24 hours. Over the past 14 days, the cryptocurrency has shown a sideways price movement with a slight decrease of 0.4%. Given Bitcoin’s well-known volatility, it remains uncertain how the market will react as the looming decision and potential catalysts draw near, and how these factors will impact its price dynamics. However, the upcoming decision is not the sole catalyst that can potentially drive Bitcoin’s price in 2024. The cryptocurrency is also anticipated to experience a significant catalyst in April 2024, known as the halving event. This event has historically resulted in an upward surge in Bitcoin’s price, and it is predicted to propel the cryptocurrency beyond its previous all-time high (ATH) of $69,000 throughout the upcoming year.
