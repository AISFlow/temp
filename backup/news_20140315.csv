42376990,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vwsr,1394892584,Bitcoin Trading Volume Concentrating in Largest Exchanges,"The vast majority of bitcoin trading volume has traditionally been handled by a relatively small number of exchanges.  However, the latest data indicates that volume has concentrated even further as smaller exchanges are being pushed aside, leaving them with a much lower share of the total volume of bitcoins traded than just a few months ago.  Lost monopoly  Prior to the start of its decline in mid-2013, Mt. Gox had what amounted to an effective monopoly on bitcoin trading volume, often commanding upwards of 80-90% of total US dollar-denominated volume.  However, as Mt. Gox’s problems mounted, the bitcoin exchange sector took on a more oligopolistic appearance.  Exchanges such as Bistamp and BTC-e began to rise, eventually joining Mt. Gox at the top of the volume leaderboard. Each of these exchanges – the ‘Big Three’ – accounted for roughly 30% each of total US$ bitcoin trading volume near the end of 2013 (see Table 1).  Table 1: Top 3 Bitcoin Exchange US$ Volume Market Share, late 2013  Date  Bitstamp  Mt.

Small but significant  However, even with a small handful of exchanges dominating total trading share, traditionally there was a not-insignificant amount of trading taking place at the other smaller exchanges.  For example, from September though early-October 2013, exchanges such as CampBX and other smaller exchanges combined to handle thousands of bitcoin trades per day, frequently representing more than 10% of the total volume of bitcoins traded on any given day (see Chart 1).  Chart 1: Total US$ Bitcoin Volume Share of Small Exchanges (excludes Mt. Gox, Bitstamp, BTC-e, and Bitfinex), Sept. through early-Oct. 2013    Sources: CoinDesk, BitcoinAverage, BitcoinCharts.    However, 6th October 2013 was the last day on which smaller exchanges collectively processed 10% of the total US$ bitcoin volume.  Since October, the relative market share of the non-Big Three exchanges began plummeting and has remained low, now averaging only 0.9% of total daily US$ bitcoin volume from 10th February to 10th March 2014 (see Chart 2).  Chart 2: US$ Total Volume Market Share of All Bitcoin Exchanges, excluding Mt. Gox, Bitstamp, BTC-e, and Bitfinex, 10th Feb – 10th Mar 2014    Sources: CoinDesk, BitcoinAverage, BitcoinCharts.    In fact, on only two days in the past month did the US$ volume traded outside the Big Three exceed 2% of the total volume traded on all exchanges.  (Note: the spike in the above chart on 6th March was driven by both a relatively low total BTC volume that day, along with a one-day spike in exchange volume at itBit.)  And where 1,000-2,000 BTC collective volume days were the norm for smaller exchanges in Autumn 2013, on only nine days in the last month did we see 1,000+ collective BTC volume days for the smaller exchanges.  Has the big bitcoin shakeout begun?  Given the importance that traders place on liquidity, along with the relatively small total size of bitcoin trading volumes as compared to other securities markets, it’s not at all surprising to see bitcoin trading volume further concentrating in the largest exchanges.  What’s less clear is whether the decline and ultimate bankruptcy of Mt. Gox has also led bitcoin traders to concentrate trading across fewer, larger exchanges.  Regardless, one of the themes expressed in the recently issued State of Bitcoin 2014 report was an expectation that we would begin seeing some rationalization and consolidation this year across certain sectors of the bitcoin economy, just as we are witnessing right now in the exchange sector.

42376981,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vwk3,1394887857,How Bitcoin is Changing Everything,"Perhaps the single most prominent, and telling, feature of bitcoin today is its massive controversy in the media. Not a single day goes by without an article or televised mention about its dangers, risks, and dubious mainstream appeal.  Many in the mainstream seem set in their beliefs that bitcoin is a fad, or even worse a ponzi scheme, and is destined to fail. Yet when was the last time a ponzi scheme attracted global attention and prominent venture capital investment? Since when has a fad incited the simultaneous and largely hostile reactions of governments across the globe?  Why did other payment technologies like PayPal or Western Union apparently fail to meet the requirements to be discussed in virtually every central bank on the planet, yet cryptocurrency is being so thoroughly scrutinised? Ironically enough, the on-going debate about whether or not bitcoin is truly a valuable disruptive technology, is all the evidence you need that it is.  This is because bitcoin as a technology isn’t just challenging business models, or even an entire industry. Plenty of innovative outfits do that with much less flare. Bitcoin is challenging the financial infrastructure of the whole global economy, and even more, it is challenging entire generations of established political and economic theory that that infrastructure is built on.  Bitcoin's exponential growth flouts all of the traditional monetary theory that is the mainstream ideology amongst academics and politicians today. Its very existence and growing success cannot be accounted for within these old paradigms.  It challenges not only the basis and underlying assumptions of the modern financial system, but calls into question the beliefs and even livelihood of so many politicians, economic advisors, and media pundits. That is why so many are so sceptical of it, and others even outright hostile.  Bitcoin the currency  As a currency, bitcoin is in many ways the antithesis of modern fiat currencies. It has grown exponentially in usage the last year, and all without being declared by any state or central bank as “legal tender”. That simple fact astonishes many in academia, who could never have guessed a currency could spontaneously form and organically grow within the modern free market.  It was something that was never even discussed theoretically, and is still taking time to sink in amidst the denials that bitcoin is here to stay.  Yet this occurrence is surprisingly not entirely without precedence. Bitcoin is not the only example of a homogenous “good” being adopted by a population as a currency, for nothing but its underlying natural value and universal appeal. We have a much older example of that: gold, more than 5,000 years ago.  Cryptocurrency is following the same path as precious metals in ancient civilization. Where gold was valued for its color, easy malleability, purity and its anti-corrosive properties, bitcoin is valued for it’s speed, decentralization, anonymity and ultra low transaction costs.  Gold was discovered by practically every world civilization and became a good of such universal value it slowly became the de facto means of exchange (along with silver) across much of the planet, eventually culminating in the Classical Gold Standard. That is a span of dominance of thousands of years, compared with the 43 years of the global fiat system we have today.  History thus clearly shows that the idea of a currency deriving value primarily from the “backing” of some central state is nonsense.  For the vast majority of civilization, money was gold or silver, and both originated not as centrally issued currency that, as a result, magically had value, but as universally valued substances.  Bitcoin is fast becoming the first commodity since gold to become a widely accepted means of exchange without the need of a central authority backing it.  However unlike gold, Bitcoin is completely out of the reach of governments and can’t be regulated, centralized, or ultimately shut down and replaced with inflationary fiat money. For all its durability and timeless lustre, gold my pale to the longevity of a cryptocurrency system.    Reacting to Big Data        However Bitcoin is not just a currency that promises to eventually end the trend of patchwork national currencies that exist for the almost sole purpose of allowing governments to endlessly fund their own deficit spending.  When the Internet was growing in the 90s it promised a future in which everyone everywhere had access to all the knowledge in the world, a future where technology ultimately empowered the individual.  Indeed, this promise is coming closer and closer everyday as more people in underdeveloped countries have access to cheaper and cheaper smartphones and Internet access. However behind this positive outward development, the big players have long since been behind a much different trend.  [post-quote]  Google, Facebook, as well as many others, all keep meticulous track of user data for advertising and other purposes. On several occasions, the massive amounts of data collected by Internet service and telecommunications companies have been utilized by agencies such as the NSA, under morally questionable motives at best.  The result is a system that has evolved with the ability to track everything you do, like, go, and know, and then provide all of that data to one central authority you may or may not trust, all with little choice for the consumer. The Internet has recently been more reminiscent of Orwell’s 1984, rather than the future of individual empowerment that was promised.  Cryptocurrency is the first major technological advancement that, intentionally or not, is a massive reaction to the trend of Big Data. It is decentralized and anonymous by design, and it is these key features within the Bitcoin protocol itself that may be the key to weakening the hold of massive data collecting service companies like Google.  Already, all payments with Bitcoin are anonymous, which could allow users to opt out of advertising with anonymous micropayments. Yet many other cryptocurrencies such as Namecoin are attempting to take the protocol that enables this and use it to build other decentralized networks.  Among these can be email, domain names, and other such systems.  Decentralized applications  This is only the beginning however, businesses will hopefully creatively utilize the open source design of Bitcoin to provide entirely secure and anonymous end-to-end experiences. The possibilities for the emerging wave of decentralized applications are endless, and only time will tell what it does result in. As David Johnston, the $1m sponsor of the Austin Bitcoin Hackathon put it:    “[Decentralized applications] have the potential to become self-sustaining because they empower their stakeholders to invest in the development of the DA.      Because of that, it is conceivable that DAs for payments, social networking, and cloud computing may one day surpass the valuation of multinational corporations like Western Union, Visa, Facebook, Google, and Amazon that are are currently active in the space.”    At the very least, the ever-growing success of bitcoin thus far candidly illustrates that there is indeed a massive demand for anonymity online, one companies would be wise to take advantage of.  It’s far too tempting to compare bitcoin to PCs, the Internet, or even to gold 5,000 years ago. While it does possess similarities with many of these things, and comparing it to such landmark achievements underscores its importance, bitcoin is it’s own phenomena.  PCs may have had a huge amount of industry leaders shrugging it off or denouncing it entirely like bitcoin does now, but it never had whole governments attempting to shut down or regulate its use.  Precious metals may have been the first and last good to become universally adopted as a means of exchange, but this was a slow process that took centuries if not millennia, whereas the usage of cryptocurrencies has exploded in just a few short years.  While bitcoin may have many old conceptual roots, it is altogether new and powerful. It is ushering in a new paradigm in various aspects of society, and creating a new benchmark for future technological achievements to inevitably be compared to.  Bitcoin is changing everything, and if you aren’t on board, then you’re already a dinosaur.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Ariel Deschapell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/15/how-bitcoin-is-changing-everything,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b79c72fbdc3f07a1a9b29d19e371a3ed5fa6edb1-1000x841.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376975,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vwZz,1394882972,Bitcoin Businesses and Canadian Banks: The 'Catch 22’ Dilemma,"Matt Burgoyne is an associate at Canadian legal firm McLeod Law. He is involved with Canadian and international counsel in the developing area of virtual currency law, specifically including bitcoin currency.  One of the most frustrating things I encounter when being retained by a new client or working with an existing client operating in the bitcoin space is that without exception, I have the unfortunate task of advising them that as it stands now in Canada, the chances of them obtaining a regular commercial services based bank account are 0%.  [post-quote]  Sometimes this is a non-starter and the bitcoin entity makes the decision to set up operations in another country, which is extremely unfortunate for a variety of reasons, including the economic loss to Canada derived from losing a potential new Canadian business and the more important loss to the potential client in regards to their bitcoin business.  This is a shame, because, as I have previously mentioned on CoinDesk, Canada is an attractive environment for bitcoin entities to set up operations since our country does not have, for example, the state-by-state money transmitting regulations that currently exist in the US.  Businesses need banks  Without basic commercial banking services, most bitcoin businesses would have a tough time operating, as businesses in general often need, as an example, the ability to deposit money somewhere and require some level of online banking.  I have personally spoken with presidents and senior vice-presidents of major Canadian banking institutions and credit unions, and the impressions I get can be summed up as follows:  (a) Banks are still in the process of figuring out what bitcoin is and how to deal with it, since it is a disruptive technology which could arguably compete with the bank’s own existing services and products (although no banking executives on my calls explicitly mentioned the competition concern).  (b) Banks are apprehensive about boarding new bitcoin clients because Canada’s federal government, via the Department of Finance, has yet to introduce regulations which specifically target bitcoin and digital currency operations.  (c) Banks are apprehensive about boarding bitcoin entities over concerns related to money laundering activities which could be carried out by their newly boarded digital currency clients.  Guidance lacking  As mentioned in section (b) above, Canadian bitcoin entities are presently victims of a ‘catch 22’ type of situation: they are caught in a situation from which they cannot escape because they are subject to arbitrary banking rules and the lack of Canadian legislation, which effectively places them in a situation in which they have no control over.  Buried on page 134 of the 419-page recently released Canadian 2014 Federal Budget, the Canadian federal government confirms that it will “introduce anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regulations for virtual currencies, such as bitcoin”.  OK, so regulations will be introduced by the Canadian government which will specifically address bitcoin, which would, in my opinion, put Canadian banks and credit unions at least partially at ease as per (b) above, but when are these regulations going to be announced and come into effect?  There has been absolutely no guidance from the federal government on this issue. It could be next week or it could be in six months. In the meantime, bitcoin entities are caught in this unfortunate ‘catch 22’ predicament.  Banking hypocrisy?  An issue which deserves some serious attention is the way that both Canadian and international banks execute their anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regulations.  It’s great that banks have anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing policies, but often the execution of those policies are abhorrent and sloppy at best.  Case in point, in an article published by elitedaily.com on February 21st 2014, entitled 'The Ugly Truth Behind Major Banks Financing Mexico’s Drug Cartels', the author noted that:  “Since 2006, more than a dozen banks have reached settlements with the Justice Department (United States) as restitution for violations related to money laundering. American Express Bank International admitted to processing more than $55 million in drug money that had been laundered through offshore shell accounts that it operates.”  Readers may recall that last December, the British bank HSBC (which has a large Canadian presence) agreed to settle with the US Justice Department to pay approximately $2 billion in penalties for having moved $881 million in drug proceeds from cartels in Mexico and Columbia during a recent five-year period.  Arguments have been made that banks in general often do not face criminal prosecution for violating anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regulations, but instead, according to the author of the aforementioned article referred to above, “(accept) settlements that either defer or erase the threat of criminal suits.”  If this is true, it can be argued that there is little incentive for banks to actually toughen internal regulatory compliance.  There have been instances of senior bank executives leaving their positions at their respective banks because of this lack of internal regulatory compliance.  For example, in the aforementioned article, reference is made to a gentlemen named Martin Woods, who served as director of Wachovia’s anti-money laundering unit in London for three years before leaving his position ‘in disgust’ after his repeated requests to executives to put a stop to ongoing drug money laundering operations, which were allegedly occurring in Wachovia’s branch network, were ignored).  Ignored issue  Canadian and international banks take the position that they won’t board bitcoin clients because of concerns that bitcoin entities could be used to facilitate drug money laundering activities. At the same time as a result of sloppy execution some of these banks are guilty themselves of facilitating drug money laundering activities and as a result have paid billion dollar settlement fines.  Is this hypocrisy? At a minimum it appears to be an inconsistent application of anti-money laundering policies internally versus externally to bitcoin clients.  I believe that the mainstream media, when discussing bitcoin and the risk of money laundering activities associated with it, fails to consider or comment on the hypocrisy issue discussed above. This is most unfortunate.

42376976,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vwdl,1394844534,TigerDirect Tops $1 Million in Total Bitcoin Sales,"Florida-based online high-tech retailer TigerDirect passed $1m in total bitcoin sales on 13th March, less than two months after it began accepting the digital currency.  TigerDirect began taking bitcoin on 23rd January, partnering with Georgia-based merchant processor BitPay, and has been active at incentivizing its budding bitcoin customer base.  Steven Leeds, director of marketing at Tiger Direct, told CoinDesk that his company has been very pleased with its decision so far.  Said Leeds:  ""The overwhelming response from our customers validates our decision.""  In addition to the sales increase, Leeds indicates that customers have benefitted from the arrangement as well, saving money on transaction fees when compared to other forms of online payment such as credit cards.  TigerDirect joins Overstock as the second merchant to pass the $1m bitcoin sales mark. Overstock announced that it reached the milestone on 4th March.  Winning combination  So far, TigerDirect's results indicate that bitcoin has resonated with its predominantly high-tech customer base. TigerDirect took roughly 50 days to pass the $1m mark, based on its own projections.  Notably, TigerDirect saw a 50% spike on sales of some items in the aftermath of the announcement. The top-selling items on the site were video cards, power units, tablets, Xbox units and other high-tech items.  Overstock did not provide hard figures as to when it passed $1m in total, citing legal reasons, but did suggest that this mark was passed in mid-February. The Utah-based e-commerce giant later confirmed this figure on 4th March.  The similar timelines indicate that TigerDirect may not have had a sales advantage, though its audience and bitcoin's were more likely to overlap.  Merchant impact  TigerDirect's success is likely to play a key role in convincing more merchants to accept bitcoin payments, given that it has now proven to be a large and consistent revenue stream for two major merchants.  Earlier this week, US retailer Lord & Taylor's parent company Hudson Bay Co. revealed Overstock played a key role in convincing it that it was time to test the waters with bitcoin.  The news comes as bitcoin merchant processors such as BitPay and Coinbase continue to add merchants at an increasing rate. BitPay has indicated it is now adding more than 1,000 merchants per week.
