38203468,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/why-altcoin-market-struggles-to-rise,1735342878,Why Altcoin Market Struggles to Rise?,"Over the past 7 days, $WIF has dropped 12%, $BONK is down 8%, $ETH has fallen 4%, $SOL has slipped 3%, and $SHIB has decreased by 2%. This widespread dip in altcoin prices is largely tied to Bitcoin's dominance (BTC.D), which currently sits at a high 58.1%. What is BTC.D and Why Does It Matter? Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) is the percentage of the total cryptocurrency market made up by Bitcoin. When BTC.D is high, it means most of the money in the market is flowing into Bitcoin rather than altcoins. This often happens during times of uncertainty, as investors see Bitcoin as a safer bet compared to smaller coins.For altcoins to thrive, BTC.D needs to go down. A lower BTC.D signals that investors are moving funds into smaller altcoins, which drives their prices up. Historically, BTC.D starts to drop in the first quarter of a new year. When this happens, it usually kicks off an ""altcoin season,"" where altcoins grow much faster than Bitcoin.That means altcoins such as $WIF, $BONK, $ETH, $SOL, and $SHIB will likely start moving to the upside significantly. However, to maximize gains, it’s essential to pick the highest winners. Among the most promising winners for the upcoming altcoin season, experts highlight Altura ($ALU) as a standout project. Why Altura ($ALU) Could Be the Star of Altcoin Season One of the most exciting projects to watch during the next altcoin season is Altura($ALU). Altura is an AI-driven cryptocurrency that’s focused on revolutionizing the NFT and gaming world. By using artificial intelligence, Altura offers cutting-edge solutions that are catching the attention of both crypto and tech enthusiasts.Currently, Altura is only at a $100 million market cap, making it an undervalued gem. A 10x growth would mean reaching just a $1 billion market cap, which is considered achievable given the rapid growth of the AI and gaming industries. These industries are expanding at an incredible pace, and Altura’s unique role in both sectors gives it a strong chance to succeed.What makes Altura special is not just its innovative approach but also its potential for massive returns. Experts predict it could deliver gains as high as 10x to 20x for early investors. While other coins may also rise during altcoin season, they might not provide the same explosive returns as Altura . Its focus on two of the fastest-growing industries—AI and gaming—positions it as a leader in the space. Final Thoughts The current struggles in the altcoin market are closely tied to Bitcoin's dominance. As long as BTC.D stays high, altcoins are likely to remain under pressure. However, history shows that this trend doesn’t last forever. Once BTC.D starts to decline, altcoin season can begin, creating exciting opportunities for smaller coins.For investors looking to maximize their returns, keeping an eye on promising projects like Altura ($ALU) is essential. With its strong use of AI and its position in the rapidly growing NFT and gaming sectors, Altura could lead the next wave of altcoin growth and deliver impressive returns in the coming months. Its low current market cap makes it a prime candidate for explosive gains, offering a rare opportunity in the crypto market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

38205151,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323115,1735342200,"Japan, Russia Rule Out National Bitcoin Reserve ‘For Now’","The governments of Japan and Russia have ruled out creating national Bitcoin (BTC) reserves in the near future. Both said they would prefer to see how other countries – such as the USA – develop Bitcoin reserves before taking action. In Japan, the government issued a statement in response to a question from a lawmaker who suggested the state begin stockpiling BTC . And in Moscow, the nation’s Finance Minister stated that Russia would be “better off keeping” its “powder dry.” Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba (left), Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov (right); (Sources: Ogiyoshisan ;Kremlin.ru [CC BY-SA 3.0; CC BY 4.0] Japan, Russia: No Bitcoin Reserve Plans On December 11, the Japanese lawmaker Satoshi Hamada asked for the government’s opinion on his claim that “Japan should follow the example of the United States and other countries.” Hamada urged Tokyo to “consider converting part of its foreign exchange reserves into cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.” In a government release published on the Japanese House of Councillors’ website , Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s office stated that it does not yet “have a detailed understanding of developments in the United States and other countries.” Ishiba’s office said that plans to roll out a national Bitcoin reserve in the US and elsewhere were “still in their early stages.” As such, the PM’s team said, it is still “difficult for the government to express a view” on the matter. Inflation in Japan's capital accelerates, keeps rate hike prospects intact https://t.co/kPji7EHgz9 pic.twitter.com/cbDtZk2VdW — Reuters (@Reuters) December 27, 2024 Lack of Legal Framework The written response also made note of the fact that Japanese law does not currently allow Tokyo to hold crypto. And the PM’s team wrote that existing foreign currency reserves are only “intended to stabilize Japan’s foreign currency-denominated assets and foreign currency bond markets.” The government added that the “volatility of cryptoassets, including Bitcoin,” made them “incompatible with the current system.” The Japanese media outlet CoinPost wrote that the “official response from Prime Minister Ishiba” once again “demonstrates that the Japanese government is maintaining a cautious stance” on crypto. Ishiba has made a series of cagey remarks on crypto adoption in recent weeks . These include non-committal and conservative comments on possible crypto tax reforms and Bitcoin spot ETF approval. The outlet wrote that Ishiba’s comments come “amid ongoing discussions both at home and abroad about using crypto as a national reserve asset.” No Russian BTC Reserve? Meanwhile, Russia’s RBC reported that Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told a student audience at the state-run Financial University that “the issue of creating a cryptocurrency reserve could be considered in the future,” but noted that the matter was not currently on the table. Russia faces increasing difficulty shipping commodities to China through its vast eastern rail network, a sign of the growing economic challenges stemming from war and sanctions, despite the Kremlin’s assurances that all is well. https://t.co/4RSNQbgh0G — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) December 23, 2024 Siluanov said the issue could be contemplated at a future date, after Moscow “assesses what happens over the next five to 10 years.” “It is of course easy to [say]: If you had invested money in Bitcoin at the beginning of the year, you would have earned twice or even three times your money back. However, there is also a risk of loss. So the state does not take those kinds of financial risks. Not at all. It is better to earn less, but keep – as they say – your powder dry,” Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov Siluanov added that despite the rapid growth in BTC prices this year, “cryptocurrencies are less predictable today than other assets.” However, he added: “Maybe someday, we will come around to the idea of [building a national Bitcoin reserve]. The Americans are talking about this now. They are talking about using crypto as a national reserve asset. But since crypto is a very volatile instrument, investing a sovereign state’s funds in something so [unpredictable] is probably dangerous.” Trump Ready to Act US President-elect Donald Trump has spoken about launching state-operated BTC reserve on multiple occasions. ‘Crazy worked just fine the first time’: Why some Republicans see Trump’s imperialist musings as an act of negotiation. https://t.co/WXlPZ4eDle — POLITICO (@politico) December 26, 2024 American lawmakers have already prepared the ground for this, crafting a bill that would prepare the legal framework for such a move.

Other nations are also exploring their BTC-buying options, with Brazilian officials particularly keen.

38205150,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323178,1735341788,XRP to Overtake BTC and ETH Crypto Analyst Points to $1.5 Trillion Market Cap,"One crypto analyst on X shared on Wednesday an investment thesis that sees the market cap of XRP surging to as much as $1.56 trillion if the token’s dominance continues to scale up in the following months. Egrar Crypto, a technical analyst whose X account is followed by nearly 70,000 fans people, emphasized that Ripple could deliver much higher gains than Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) during this stage of the bull market. #XRP – Will Outperform #ETH and #BTC – The Secret Is Under the Hood! #XRP Market Cap Window = $619.61B – $1.56T Ready How and Why. This post focuses on XRP's Dominance and its Market Cap potential, revealing why it has a much higher multiplier than both ETH and BTC.… pic.twitter.com/7CbaGlPxjr — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 25, 2024 He first shared an assessment of how XRP’s dominance has been evolving lately, moving from as little as 1% to over 5% in the past four years, primarily as a result of the legal victory that Ripple had in its case against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He went on to predict that a break above the 0.5 Fibonacci level – typically interpreted as a bullish signal – could propel XRP’s dominance to 11.44%. Given that the combined value of cryptocurrencies currently stands at $3.28 trillion, that would mean XRP’s market value could be propelled to $375 million on short notice if that scenario unfolds as Egrar Crypto expects. This would result in 3X gains for XRP holders based on the token’s current market cap. However, Egrar predicts that the total market cap of cryptos could surge to $5.42 trillion once alt-coin season starts, meaning that reaching the 11.44% dominance level would mean a total market cap of $620 billion or 5X gains for XRP investors. Although past performance is not a guarantee of future outcomes, the trend for XRP dominance is currently on an upward path. If its ascent continues, these are plausible targets that could be reached in the medium term. XRP at $4 Before Year End is a Real Possibility From a technical standpoint, the $4 area is a feasible target that XRP could reach once the market shakes off the latest pullback and late buyers enter the scene to add more fuel to the rally. The post-election uptick that the crypto market experienced is interpreted by analysts as the first wave in what could be a prolonged climb for digital assets as multiple tailwinds including Donald Trump’s victory in the November U.S. presidential election and the Federal Reserve’s commitment to keep lowering rates are favoring higher prices for risky assets like cryptos. XRP has been the most favored asset of this rally of all the top 10 cryptocurrencies as it experienced a 253% uptick since a court of law ruled in favor of the company in its long-standing legal rift against the SEC. The robustness of the XRP network and the active involvement of its C-level officers along with a strong community of die-hard backers who have accompanied the project despite the many challenges it has faced could make XRP become a powerhouse in the cross-border payments, decentralized finance (DeFi) , and smart contracts segments. The launch of the stablecoin RLUSD is a step forward for the project to keep expanding its reach. During the latest pullback, XRP has found support at around $1.95 per token. This is the most critical area to watch moving forward. As long as it holds, it could serve as a launching pad once alt-season kicks in. The short-term target of $4 seems attainable and this would result in XRP doubling its market cap. However, the target shared by Egrar Crypto provides a longer-term view of the potential of this cryptocurrency to keep expanding its footprint in the crypto market.

38202236,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=314382,1735340467,"Nearly $1,700,000,000 in Crypto Lost Through Private Keys Theft As Access Control Exploits Becomes Major Threat","New data from cybersecurity firm Hacken reveals that $1.7 billion worth of crypto assets were lost through the theft of private keys in 2024. In its 2024 Web3 Security Report, Hacken says that the theft of private crypto keys remains the most “significant” threat to crypto investors. According to Hacken, the number of smart contract exploits pale in comparison to how often private crypto keys are stolen. “In 2024, access control exploits – closely tied to private key compromises – accounted for nearly of total crypto hack losses, up from 50% in 2023. This translates to nearly lost across Web3, a sharp increase from less than $1 billion the previous year. 75% $1.7 billion In comparison, smart contract vulnerability exploits contributed just 14% of the total losses in 2024, underscoring the dominant threat posed by unauthorized access and private key theft.” Private keys are strings of letters, words, and numbers generated by crypto wallets used to authorize transactions and prove ownership. They help encrypt data and assets to protect them from being stolen. The cybersecurity firm goes on to note four reasons why people tend to get their private keys stolen – using an insecure management platform, being tricked by social engineering campaigns, insecure backups of data, and vulnerabilities within single-signature schemes of crypto wallets. According to Hacken, the largest exploit of 2024 was the hack of centralized Indian crypto exchange WazirX, which saw over $230 million worth of digital assets stolen. “Despite employing a robust multiparty security system, the exchange suffered a breach due to unauthorized fund movements from their wallets. WazirX utilized a Gnosis Safe multisig wallet requiring 4 out of 6 signatures for transactions. Five of the keys were managed by WazirX, while the sixth was held by Liminal, a digital asset custody provider. The attacker managed to manipulate the system, obtaining signatures from three WazirX signers and one from Liminal, allowing them to upgrade the wallet to a malicious contract and siphon off the funds.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

As blockchain technology becomes more widespread, Chainlink’s indispensable role cements it as one of the top picks for achieving 100x growth. 3. Solana (SOL) Solana distinguishes itself with unmatched transaction speed and minimal fees, handling up to 65,000 transactions per second, making it perfect for DeFi projects, gaming, and NFTs.

The platform’s increasing involvement in government-backed digital currency initiatives and robust ecosystems in DeFi and NFTs underscore its potential for significant returns. 6. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin remains an outlier with its community-driven nature and practical use cases, evolving from a meme into a widely used currency for tipping, payments, and microtransactions. https://web3bay.io/ Supported by a strong community and increasingly accepted as a payment method, ongoing enhancements to its network bolster its potential as a viable investment. Although it may carry greater risks, Dogecoin’s widespread popularity and adoption trends support its inclusion as a top pick for massive growth in 2025.

Pinpointing the best crypto picks for 100x potential is challenging but far from unattainable.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/winter-pepe-pepewint-solana-memecoin-to-surge-17000-ahead-of-exchange-listings-while-shib-doge-and-bonk-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Emerging blockchain platforms are poised to revolutionize the market by the year 2025. This article explores the innovative technologies that are expected to drive the next significant surge in digital currencies. Delve into the developments that could reshape the future of crypto and potentially transform the global financial system. Graphite Token (@G): Powering the Blockchain That Could Topple Ethereum and Solana Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have had their time in the spotlight. Now, Graphite Token (@G) is here, bringing with it the power of the Graphite L1 blockchain designed to make crypto simpler, faster, and more rewarding for everyone. Could this be the next big thing to follow Ethereum’s legendary 4,000X growth? The secret to life-changing crypto profits lies in spotting the next hidden gem before the crowd. History shows that early adopters of projects with real utility reap massive rewards: Solana started at $0.04 and skyrocketed to nearly $300 — a staggering +7,500%. Ethereum launched below $1 and climbed to around $4,000 — an insane +400,000%. The secret to their growth? Utility. The more people use them, the more valuable their tokens become. But times have changed, and these blockchains aren’t cutting it anymore. Discover SOL and ETH Challenger for 4,000X Profit Potential What’s Wrong with Ethereum and Solana? Older blockchains face growing challenges like rising fees, complexity, regulatory uncertainty, and questions about reliability. Take Solana, which occasionally experiences network outages, or Ethereum, which saw a significant reduction in its burn rate in 2024. Between unpredictable gas costs, unsatisfactory speed, and unreliable service, users are starting to look elsewhere. The dominance of the “old guard” is fading. What Graphite Brings to the Table Graphite is built to address the challenges of older blockchains with a set of practical features. Direct Rewards for Entry-Point Nodes Graphite has something no other blockchain offers. It lets entry-point nodes earn 50% of transaction fees passing through their nodes, so literally anyone contributing to its operations can earn a share. Transparent, Trust-Based Interactions Graphite’s reputation-based system introduces a Trust Score, a measure of user credibility similar to a credit rating in TradFi. This approach enhances transparency while keeping user privacy within the network where interactions are built on trust. Fair Fees, Fast Speed, and High Scalability Powered by the PoA Polymer 2.0 Algorithm, Graphite keeps fees plain and as low as possible by minimizing computational and energy costs. The network processes up to 1,400 transactions per second with confirmation times under 10 seconds, delivering a perfect balance of speed, cost-efficiency, and reliability. Security as a Top Priority Graphite enforces a one user - one account policy to safeguard its network against fraud and scams. Additionally, it offers an optional KYC verification procedure with three tiers of off-chain checks powered by ZKP to ensure compliance while protecting user data. With transaction filters, users can choose to interact only with accounts that meet specific KYC levels, adding an extra layer of security. Is This Your Chance to Get in Early? The Graphite blockchain is secure, transparent, scalable, and cost-efficient, making it the go-to choice for developers and users alike. With its practical approach and early adoption potential, Graphite is a project worth watching. For those looking to get in early, Graphite offers an opportunity to be part of a blockchain that’s designed for long-term growth and usability. Will it deliver 4,000X gains? Time will tell, but the foundation is strong. This could be your shot at 4,000X profits — Don’t miss out! ARB Token: Empowering Ethereum with Arbitrum's Layer-2 Scaling ARB is the token powering Arbitrum, a Layer-2 solution for Ethereum developed by Offchain Labs. Arbitrum enhances Ethereum by increasing transaction speed, scalability, and privacy. It uses optimistic rollups to improve smart contract performance and lower execution costs. ARB serves as a governance token, allowing holders to vote on network decisions and participate in ecosystem development. The initial supply is 10 billion tokens, with a maximum yearly inflation rate of 2%. Distribution includes allocations to investors, DAOs, individual wallets, a DAO Treasury, and the team and advisors. The Arbitrum DAO oversees any changes in token allocation. Solana (SOL): Exploring a Scalable Blockchain for Decentralized Apps Solana is a blockchain platform that focuses on scalability. It provides a foundation for decentralized applications, similar to Ethereum and Cardano. Solana stands out because of its architecture designed for fast transactions and flexible development across many programming languages. SOL is the native cryptocurrency of Solana. It plays a central role in the ecosystem. Users can use SOL to facilitate transactions, run custom programs, and reward network supporters. The SOL coin holds value because it underpins the operation of the Solana ecosystem. It rewards participants and allows access to various projects. Solana avoids sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. Its high-capacity network aims to attract developers and investors by hosting high-activity products and services. AVAX: Avalanche's Eco-Friendly Blockchain with High Transaction Capacity AVAX is the native token of Avalanche, a Layer-1 blockchain known for its low fees and quick transaction processing. The platform uses a hybrid consensus mechanism that combines classical and Nakamoto principles, aiming to finalize transactions in less than two seconds. Avalanche features three interoperable chains—the X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—that handle various functions like transactions and smart contracts. AVAX plays a central role in the ecosystem, used for transaction fees, securing the network through staking, and operating multiple Subnets. This utility supports payments, staking rewards, and the creation of custom tokens and blockchains within the network. Conclusion In conclusion, while coins like ARB, SOL, and AVAX show promise, they may have less potential in the short term. The Graphite Token (@G) powers the innovative Graphite L1 blockchain, aiming to simplify crypto and deliver unmatched speed and rewards. It tackles issues like Ethereum's high fees and Solana's network outages by offering fair transaction costs and a Trust Score system based on reputation. A unique reward model allows entry-point nodes to earn 50% of transaction fees, encouraging active participation. With strong security through Polymer 2.0 and optional KYC verification, Graphite sets new standards for blockchain reliability. For early adopters, it presents an exciting opportunity to engage with a project built for long-term growth. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

Cardano, which has a market capitalization of $31.4 billion, and Ripple’s XRP, with a market capitalization of $123 billion, could be planning to enter into a symbiotic relationship. Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson , has aroused discussions about adding XRP to Cardano’s privacy-focused Midnight sidechain. XRP in Cardano’s Midnight? Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, has hinted at the likelihood of partnering with Ripple. He suggested that the Midnight sidechain focused on privacy could include XRP in the project. The discussion also covered Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin as a potential addition to Cardano’s ecosystem. Hoskinson also mentioned that he had been holding talks with Ripple CTO David Schwartz as well as the company’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse. “Dave Schwartz is a great guy. He’s a brilliant guy. It’s a lot of fun being in meetings with him, and I love to hang out with him,” Hoskinson stated. Ripple’s resilience amid its legal battles with the U.S. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) impressed Hoskinson. The court case between Ripple and the SEC started in December 2020. Through XRP, the SEC alleged that Ripple sold securities without receiving prior approval. In July of 2023, the federal court ruled that XRP is not a security when traded in public platforms, among other things. However, unfavorable penalties and appeal proceedings continue to exert regulatory pressure on Ripple. In a recent live stream , Hoskinson even boasted about how well the company is run to deal with lawsuits, delistings, and regulation. Despite setbacks, Ripple remains a key player in the crypto space. Hoskinson also discussed using XRP in Midnight. This sidechain is built to focus on privacy within decentralized applications. He also mentioned that Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin could work in many ways for Cardano’s ecosystem. Hoskinson’s Budding Relationship with Ripple The Cardano founder’s comments show a shift in his stance toward Ripple. He previously publicly apologized to the XRP community on November 10. Collaboration talks suggest Ripple and Cardano may align on privacy and smart contract innovations. Ripple remains a top crypto player. XRP is the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, with a $31.4 billion market cap as of Dec. 27 (CoinMarketCap). Despite legal challenges, Ripple continues to push forward with new initiatives. The discussions signal a potential alliance between Ripple and Cardano . This could create new opportunities in blockchain privacy and stablecoin integration if realized.

38201300,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667732,1735338641,Dogecoin Rally Ahead: Analyst Hints At A Bigger Breakout Than 2021,"Analysts are excited about the possibility of a huge Dogecoin rally in 2025, with some believing it would far outperform the enormous gains recorded in 2021. Related Reading: Dogecoin 600% Rally Prediction Still On Track Before End Of 2024 — Analyst According to recent studies, historical price fluctuations show that the popular meme coin may experience another parabolic boom. Dogecoin has been notorious for its wild price swings, and many predict that the coming year will be critical to its progress. Historical Patterns Suggest Potential Gains Dogecoin has had a history of sharp price increases followed by declines. For instance, in 2017 it rose 210% prior to reversing, then suddenly jumped 5,000%. In 2021, it followed a pattern, initially rising 476% before a significant reversal that ended with an astonishing increase of 12,000%. Dogecoin is now up around 440% over the last year, but has lately had a 46% pullback. Analysts believe that this repeated pattern implies a potential significant rally. Dogecoin Bullish Forecasts For 2025 Many analysts have made quite optimistic projections on the course Dogecoin’s price might take over 2025. While some have ranged within $1 and $3, others have pegged it as high as $10. Investments CEO said in a post on Christmas Day that Dogecoin would repeat its fourth-year cyclical performance. At the same time, he said that the meme coin’s rise would be better compared to that of 2021. A MASSIVE rally is coming for $DOGE, MUCH bigger than the one in 2021. Are you prepared? pic.twitter.com/auBAw7XMMn — CEO (@Investments_CEO) December 25, 2024 Meanwhile, some likely involvement from Elon Musk may be another crucial point, who is probably going to have a key role to play in the meme coin community sometime in the next year. His influence will probably create just the ideal atmosphere for Dogecoin to reach new highs. According to analyst Javon Marks, Dogecoin may surge as high as 600%, reaching approximately $2.28 based on past trends and market behavior. He says that previous cycles have followed similar patterns, leading to huge price increases. Market Sentiment And Future Outlook Despite recent volatility in the market and some bearish pressures, analysts still believe in Dogecoin’s bright future. The cryptocurrency market has recently been very volatile, and yet most of the analysts still predict that when bitcoin will stabilize and start surging again, Dogecoin will be sure to do the same. More than 140% gain of the Dogecoin’s price, taking the currency above $0.8023 is predicted once bitcoin reverses its down move.

After the holidays, the asset manager becomes one of the biggest Ethereum (ETH) whales after copping 993,591.95 ETH. This is equivalent to $3.5 billion worth of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. BlackRock Benefits from Spot Ethereum ETF BlackRock achieved this feat through its ETH Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) with the ticker ETHA. As of December 27, the firm’s Ethereum holding represents 0.12% of Ethereum’s total supply. Consequently, BlackRock has risen to become the world’s 12th-largest altcoin holder. This marks a laudable feat for a firm whose history with Ethereum began only this year. Contextually, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Ethereum ETF applications made by eight firms, including BlackRock, in July 2024 after a long wait . Ethereum Price Struggles Post-ETF Approval Since the approval of the funds, Ethereum has had a good time in terms of growth. In addition, Donald Trump’s victory in the last United States elections held in November also contributed to the price rally. At this writing, Ethereum traded at $3,313.42 after losing 1% of its 24-hour price gain. The altcoin has been stuck between critical psychological levels in the last few weeks. According to crypto analyst Rekt Capital, it has struggled to break above the $4,000 mark . The coin passed this threshold in the past and peaked at $4,077 on December 6. There are speculations that Ethereum could slip further down to the point of losing up to 10% of its current price level. BlackRock IBIT Records Largest Outflow BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has also recorded a lot of success this past few weeks, although it hit a roadblock recently. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) recorded its biggest outflow just a day before Christmas. This coincided with when the United States spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded four straight days of withdrawals, with over $1.5 billion missing. On Wednesday, IBIT made headlines because of a large outflow of $188.7 million . This was the largest that the fund had seen since its inception. In the coming weeks, which coincides with Donald Trump’s entry into office, the outlook of these funds may improve.

Shiba Inu (SHIB): Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Expanding Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a memecoin inspired by Dogecoin but built on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, SHIB started with a quadrillion tokens. Half of the tokens were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin, who donated and burned large amounts, increasing SHIB's visibility. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB's Ethereum base allows for applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. There are plans for a future NFT platform and a DAO-based governance system. This integration with Ethereum's ecosystem gives SHIB potential for broader utility. In the current market cycle, SHIB's developments may attract interest due to its expanding features. Conclusion Coins like SHIB may have less short-term potential, while Catzilla aims to bring financial freedom to everyone. Offering a 700% ROI potential during its presale, the token starts at $0.0002 and rises to $0.0016 over 14 stages.

38202219,https://invezz.com/?p=2407689,1735338403,Pig butchering crypto scams cost users $3.6 billion this year,"Pig butchering scams were the leading attack vector for the cryptocurrency space in 2024, resulting in multi-billion dollar losses for millions of investors. According to data from web3 security firm Cyver’s annual fraud report, scammers managed to dupe crypto users out of a whopping $3.6 billion this year, with the attacks spanning over 150,000 addresses and 800,000 transactions. The number, while significant, presents a slight drop in losses compared to the previous year, when roughly $3.96 billion was lost to similar schemes. What are pig butchering scams? Often involving sophisticated social engineering tactics, pig butchering scams are long-term fraud schemes that thrive on emotional manipulation, fake credibility, and the promise of high returns, making them one of the most insidious threats in the cryptocurrency space. The term ‘pig butchering’ has been derived from the practice of fattening a pig before slaughter, similar to how scammers build trust and rapport with their targets over weeks or even months. Fraudsters approach victims in various ways. Sometimes, they pose as romantic interests, sometimes as financial mentors, and gradually coax victims into fishy crypto investments that are too good to be true. Victims are usually led to fake trading platforms where they often see manipulated dashboards that display impressive returns to gain their trust and encourage investments. Once the victim is fully invested, the scammer disappears with the funds, leaving victims with little recourse and often no way to recover their losses. However, in a rare turn of events last month, the Federal Bureau of Investigation recovered $8.3 million connected to a pig butchering scheme. The case involved the former chief executive of Heartland Tri-State Bank, who misappropriated $47.1 million in customer funds, which ultimately led to the bank’s collapse. With pig butchering scams becoming increasingly common, authorities all across the globe have increased efforts to track and dismantle these often large criminal networks. Earlier this month, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission in Nigeria arrested 792 suspects allegedly involved in orchestrating pig butchering scams. Cyber attacks on the rise However, pig butchering scams are merely the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the various types of threats that plague the cryptocurrency industry. The Cyvers report notes that hacking attacks targeting the sector jumped 40% compared to last year, with access control breaches and smart contract vulnerabilities causing the most damage. As previously reported by Invezz, a separate report from security firm Hacken also highlights a similar trend. Notably, the centralized finance sector was the most affected, with private key compromises and weak access controls emerging as primary vulnerabilities, contributing to 75% of all exploits in 2024. Besides the aforementioned schemes, phishing attacks remain another persistent threat to crypto users. Since cryptocurrencies are inherently digital and transactions occur entirely online, the ecosystem remains highly vulnerable to such attacks. Even though such losses have been steadily declining over the past months, the complex and stealthy nature of the attack makes it a common weapon in the crypto scammer’s arsenal. For instance, on December 26, scammers were seen exploiting Google ads to distribute crypto-stealing phishing scripts while mimicking the Pugy Penguins project website with the malicious content hosted on the Adloox tracking domain.

To surpass the S&P 500. The logic is as bold as it is simple: 6900 is greater than 500, so SPX6900 must be superior.

Buterin’s Christmas gift will go toward upgrading the zoo’s facilities and supporting its Wildlife Sponsorship program. Crypto Meets Conservation In a letter addressed to Khao Kheow’s director shared on X, the Russian-born programmer explained that his involvement stemmed from a recent visit to the facility, where he was captivated by its commitment to animal welfare and community engagement. He thanked the zoo for welcoming him and highlighted Moo Deng’s unique role as a cultural ambassador for Thailand. Buterin praised the animal sanctuary’s efforts and reiterated the importance of improving the pygmy hippo habitat. He also acknowledged Thailand’s hospitality to the Ethereum community, especially during Devcon SEA in Bangkok last November. The 30-year-old said he would donate no less than 10 million baht, approximately $300,000 in Moo Deng’s name, to be delivered in two installments. The first contribution was made on December 26, with the date for the second set to be communicated later. Buterin has also promised an extra 88 ETH to ensure ongoing support for the zoo’s projects. Earlier, the establishment had posted on X expressing its appreciation for the Ethereum developer’s generosity, calling him “an adoptive father to Moo Deng.” He responded, sharing his enthusiasm for the role and quoting a popular line from the Star Trek shows: “May they live long and prosper.” Market Performance Moo Deng, already a beloved symbol in Thailand, gained global fame as the face of the MOODENG coin. The token has captured the crypto community’s attention despite recent market fluctuations. At the time of this writing, it was changing hands at $0.2693, with a 24-hour trading volume of $179.7 million, representing a 50.3% surge in activity compared to the previous day. While the token’s price dipped 3.2% in the past 24 hours, it gained 6.1% over the past week, outperforming the broader crypto market, which had seen a 1.2% decline in that period. Buterin previously liquidated over $1 million worth of meme tokens donated to him, including 10 billion MOODENG, giving the proceeds to various charities. Interestingly, he was recently critical of the meme coin space, decrying the proliferation of celebrity-inspired tokens. He argued that it would be better if they had a public goal aimed at promoting a specific cause or at least incorporated fun mechanics going beyond trading.

However, in the last month, the price has decreased by 19.60%, including an 8.97% drop in the past week. Currently, SOL is trading between $160.72 and $214.47, reflecting significant volatility. Technical indicators point to potential market trends. SOL is below both its 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages at $189.09 and $190.79, respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 33.48, and the Stochastic oscillator is at 16.54, both suggesting the asset is nearing oversold conditions. The MACD level of -2.081 indicates bearish momentum may continue. Key support and resistance levels are crucial for SOL's price movement. The nearest support level is at $141.08; if the price falls below this, it could test the second support at $87.33. On the upside, breaking through the nearest resistance at $248.58 may propel the price toward the second resistance level of $302. This would represent a substantial percentage gain from current levels. Based on this data, SOL's price could rise if it surpasses resistance levels or fall further if it breaks below support levels. Dogecoin (DOGE) Over the past week, Dogecoin has fallen by 12.79%, extending a month-long drop of 20.41%. Despite this downward trend, the meme-based cryptocurrency boasts a six-month gain of 153.49%. This contrast highlights its volatile nature, offering significant returns over the long term even amid short-term losses. Technical indicators suggest Dogecoin might be oversold. The Relative Strength Index is at 28.36, and the Stochastic oscillator stands at 16.03—both below typical oversold thresholds. Additionally, the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are converging at $0.32, indicating potential price stabilization or a reversal. Looking ahead, Dogecoin faces resistance at $0.48 and stronger resistance at $0.63. Breaking through these levels could signal substantial upside, potentially leading to double-digit percentage gains. On the downside, support lies at $0.18, with a deeper support level at $0.0257. If prices slip below these points, further declines may follow. Traders are watching these key levels to gauge Dogecoin's next move. Conclusion With SOL, DOGE, and the innovative XYZVerse uniting sports fans and meme culture, these coins are poised to lead the crypto market's surge into 2025.

38201138,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99437,1735337969,MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor Pitches $280 Trillion Crypto Market Capitalization,"MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor has proposed a new framework for digital asset implementation in the United States. This will usher in new growth, with surging adoption tapping an all-time high. Recent activities in the bull cycle have led to uphill projections, although price corrections threaten momentum. In a new document, Saylor rolled out a taxonomy and proposed rights and responsibilities for participants in the crypto space. Notably, this boils down to ramping up activity in the United States and becoming a leader in space. In the run-up to November polls, President-elect Donald Trump restated his stance on the U.S. becoming a global leader in blockchain, Bitcoin, and artificial intelligence. A New All-Time Market Cap? According to the document, US participation in the crypto market will strengthen its position and lead to fresh capital inflow. Specifically, the total digital capital market is estimated to soar from $2 trillion to $280 trillion, with US investors dominating the scene. Saylor asserted that this would strengthen the dollar and reduce the national debt. Following Donald Trump’s win, institutional investors recorded massive inflows, taking the market cap above $3 trillion. This pushed the price of Bitcoin above $90K and eventually tapped $107K as buying intensified. Although the market faced slight sell pressures, traders looked to pro-market regulations as Republicans control both houses of Congress. Inflows are expected to drive global adoption, taking the market cap to an all-time high. The main instrument for the upswing is a Bitcoin strategic reserve. Tipped by most stakeholders, it is expected to attract bulls and help the county lower its debt. US Senator Cynthia Lummis proposed a bill that will see the country acquire 1 million BTC per year to be held for at least 20 years. Lummis proposes selling gold reserves to fund Bitcoin purchases. Saylor also noted that digital asset growth without Bitcoin is expected to notch inflows. A Path To Clear Rules Although sentiments have largely flipped positive following the advancement of pro-crypto bills, much effort is still required to bring the US into line with other jurisdictions. Per the document, Saylor seeks a clear framework for issuers, owners, and crypto exchanges to avoid the plethora of lawsuits previously recorded. “ Path to Legitimacy: Establish a global, real-time, and uninterrupted process for issuing, trading, and owning digital assets by individuals, corporations, and machines. Issuers: Rights: The right to create and issue digital assets. Responsibilities: Ensure fair disclosure and ethical behavior. Exchanges: Rights: The right to custody, trade, and transfer assets between clients and other exchanges. Responsibilities: Publish asset disclosures, protect client assets, and avoid conflicts of interest,” the document reads.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/microstrategys-michael-saylor-pitches-280-trillion-crypto-market-capitalization/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

Make All Your Wishes Come True with the XYZ winning team! Solana (SOL) SOL has seen notable price movements recently. Over the past six months, it has risen by 34.50%. However, in the last month, the price has decreased by 19.60%, including an 8.97% drop in the past week. Currently, SOL is trading between $160.72 and $214.47, reflecting significant volatility. Technical indicators point to potential market trends. SOL is below both its 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages at $189.09 and $190.79, respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 33.48, and the Stochastic oscillator is at 16.54, both suggesting the asset is nearing oversold conditions. The MACD level of -2.081 indicates bearish momentum may continue. Key support and resistance levels are crucial for SOL's price movement. The nearest support level is at $141.08; if the price falls below this, it could test the second support at $87.33. On the upside, breaking through the nearest resistance at $248.58 may propel the price toward the second resistance level of $302. This would represent a substantial percentage gain from current levels. Based on this data, SOL's price could rise if it surpasses resistance levels or fall further if it breaks below support levels. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) has experienced notable price movements recently. Over the past week, its price dropped by 8.42%, bringing it within the current range of $2881.83 to $3892.12. The monthly change shows a smaller decline of 2.61%, and over the past six months, ETH has decreased by 1.57%. Technical indicators suggest potential shifts in ETH's price. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 26.14, indicating that the asset is oversold. The Stochastic value is 12.83, supporting this oversold status. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level stands at -33.83, which could signal a forthcoming change in momentum. Both the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are close, at $3355.12 and $3400.11 respectively, hinting at a consolidation phase. Looking ahead, if ETH manages to surpass the nearest resistance level at $4504, it could aim for the second resistance at $5515, offering potential gains of over 15% and 40% respectively from current levels. Conversely, if it falls below the nearest support at $2483.85, the next support level is at $1473.56, which would represent a significant decrease. Traders are watching these key levels closely, as they may indicate substantial price movements in the near future. Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa (KAS) has been experiencing a noticeable decline in its price recently. Over the past week, the coin's value has dropped by approximately 10.7%. Looking at the monthly performance, it has decreased by about 23.9%. In the last six months, Kaspa has seen a significant reduction of around 36.5% in its price. Currently, KAS is trading in the range of $0.10 to $0.15, indicating a downward trend. The coin is approaching its nearest support level at $0.08. If the price dips below this point, the next support is at $0.0342, which could imply a further decline. On the upside, the immediate resistance level is at $0.18. Surpassing this could lead Kaspa toward the second resistance at $0.22, representing a potential increase of over 45% from its current lower range. Technical indicators suggest mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 30.8, and the Stochastic oscillator is approximately 10.6, both indicating that Kaspa may be entering oversold territory. The Simple Moving Averages for both 10 and 100 days are at $0.12, showing that the price is consolidating around this point. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is negative at -0.001554, hinting at bearish momentum. Based on these factors, Kaspa's price could either continue to decline or potentially rebound if buying interest increases. Conclusion Though SOL, ETH, and KAS are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ), the pioneering all-sport memecoin, offers early adopters growth potential, blending sports enthusiasm with meme culture for significant gains.

38200872,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99435,1735337679,Montenegro Justice Minister Approves Extradition Of Fallen Crypto Star Do Kwon To the U.S.,"Montenegro’s Minister of Justice officially signed the order to have Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon handed over to U.S. authorities to face charges in New York. The decision to extradite Kwon to the US rather than his native South Korea comes after Montenegro’s Constitutional Court dismissed the disgraced Terra founder’s appeal. Do Kwon To Face Trial In the US One of the most notorious figures in the crypto industry is set to be deported to the United States. The Montenegrin Minister of Justice, Bojan Božović, has approved the extradition of bombastic South Korean entrepreneur Do Kwon, the Ministry announced on Friday. “It was concluded that most of the criteria provided by law support the request for extradition by the competent authorities of the United States of America,” a translated statement from Božović reportedly said, according to news publication Vijesti . This follows a decision from the Constitutional Court of Montenegro earlier this week, which rejected Kwon’s appeal against a previous Supreme Court ruling. In September, the Supreme Court nullified Kwon’s deportation to South Korea and indicated that the Balkan nation’s Minister of Justice would make the final extradition decision. Extradition Nightmare Kwon founded Terraform Labs, popularly known for its algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) and its sister token LUNA. Both assets imploded in May 2022, wiping out over $40 billion in investor wealth overnight and triggering a chain of bankruptcies throughout the cryptosphere, before its founder went on a run from law enforcement around the world. He was arrested in March 2023 in Montenegro while attempting to travel to Dubai using a fake passport. Since being released from jail this March, Kwon has faced lengthy legal proceedings , with courts deciding between dueling demands to send him to the US or South Korea. The US has been particularly vocal in pursuing his extradition as it seeks to hold him accountable for his role in the shambolic collapse of the Terra ecosystem. Notably, in June, a New York jury found Terraform Labs and Kwon liable for fraud in a lawsuit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The verdict included six charges, including intentionally misleading investors, misrepresentations about the success and stability of Terra, and “reckless” mishandling of customer money. In June, the controversial company and its once-fugitive founder were fined a whopping $4.5 billion by the SEC after reaching a “settlement in principle”. While it’s not the outcome Kwon was hoping for, signing the order to have him transferred to the United States should hopefully conclude the multi-year legal battle.",NEGATIVE,LUNA,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | LUNA | REGULATION,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/montenegro-justice-minister-approves-extradition-of-fallen-crypto-star-do-kwon-to-the-u-s/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

Ethereum: A Leading Proof-of-Stake Blockchain with Growing Potential Ethereum is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain known for smart contracts and a wide range of decentralized applications. It supports decentralized finance and uses Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon to improve transaction efficiency. Ethereum introduced ERC-20 tokens, which are used across various applications, but transactions still require ETH for gas fees. Since its launch in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum has evolved, transitioning to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge in 2022. The upcoming sharding phase aims to enhance scalability and reduce costs. Ether (ETH) remains central, facilitating transactions and rewarding stakers. Based on historical price movements and BTC halving cycles, Ethereum's price predictions suggest potential growth. These developments may make Ethereum attractive in the current market cycle. XRP: A Fast, Low-Cost Cryptocurrency for Global Transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency that operates on the XRP Ledger. It is designed to be fast, low-cost, and open. XRP allows for borderless transactions that are resistant to censorship and counterfeiting. It does not rely on a central authority, making transactions secure and irreversible. XRP was created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz. They launched it with a supply of 100 billion tokens. Ripple received 80 billion XRP to improve network liquidity and support the ecosystem. Ripple uses XRP to facilitate quick and efficient transfers across different currencies. In the current market cycle, XRP's technology and potential applications may make it an interesting option for global payments. Conclusion As the bull run unfolds, traditional coins like ETH and XRP show less short-term potential. Investors are shifting to DOGEN, a meme token for those seeking luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by the presale's end with potential for massive returns, DOGEN builds a community of leaders and offers real benefits to early adopters.

38200826,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634150,1735337426,SEC focused on Ripple while ignoring Sam Bankman-Fried – Charles Gasparino,"The SEC’s ongoing legal battle with Ripple over its XRP token is that it is overreaching to regulate the crypto space while leaving more pressing issues such as the Sam Bankman-Fried. Focusing on Ripple could be a concerning precedent for future digital asset regulations in the U.S. This battle between the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple Labs is so important in the crypto world that many are concerned with the regulations by the U.S. government toward its digital assets. SEC’s focus on Ripple while overlooking bigger issues Fox Business Reporter Charles Gasparino was critical of other high-profile cases with Sam Bankman-Fried, but the SEC’s action against Ripple and its native cryptocurrency, XRP, got attention. Gasparino argues that the SEC is focusing on Ripple, which may be irrelevant, especially since bigger fish (Sam Bankman) are floating in the finance world. This case has gone far beyond Ripple and is bound to rewrite how the U.S. will continue to regulate its cryptocurrencies from now on. In an interview he said, Ripple Labs and Chief Executive Officer Brad Garlinghouse feel the SEC went too far. They consider the case filed in December 2020 not only an attack on Ripple but also on the cryptocurrency industry at large. Garlinghouse has also voiced his criticism of the SEC, arguing that the case will be a bad precedent for the entire industry. He further argued that the SEC does not know how to regulate cryptocurrency and that it does not appreciate the distinction between digital assets and others. Ripple vs. SEC Ripple reportedly stated its frustration at the SEC’s failure to provide clear guidance on what a company operating in the space of cryptocurrencies and related companies should do in the regulations. Ripple partially won in the court judgment made in 2023 since it ruled that XRP sold on secondary markets cannot be considered a security. The judgment separates XRP from other traditional securities transactions and brings great victory to Ripple. However, the court held that XRP’s direct sales to institutional investors are securities transactions, further pointing to the complexity of the case and the differing nature in which XRP is applied in different contexts. There is an argument that digital assets like XRP must be treated exactly the same way as the real securities inside, with general grounds that protect investors from fraud. Gary Gensler is the SEC chair then. Mr. Gensler maintains that the crypto marketplace should follow securities laws. To him, XRP, among others, has a duty to comply with securities laws for the protection of investors. In fact, the statements released by the company in 2021 have Gensler referring to Bitcoin and Ethereum as commodities but many other tokens and cryptocurrencies as likely being securities and therefore subject to the regulations. According to the SEC, Ripple sales of XRP should be considered securities, whether these are institutional or retail sales, and therefore fall within the same rules of sales that apply to stock and bonds. This being the case, the greater conversation is about how the US government should regulate cryptocurrency. Critics have pointed out the aggressive stance that the SEC has taken towards Ripple.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) , market capitalization’s second-largest meme coin, posted 3% losses in the last 24 hours as the selloff took a sharp turn. Other meme tokens have traded along similar lines, further plunging market sentiments. In the last 24 hours, whales have offloaded huge SHIB tokens, pushing the asset further into the red zone. Crypto analytics firm Lookonchain flagged a huge sale activity. A crypto whale sold 250 billion SHIB tokens worth approximately $6 million, aiming to take profits before further damage. The trader’s SHIB portfolio stands in profit after scooping 15.28 trillion SHIB for $3.8K in August 2020. From that point, the meme coin’s price has soared following bull cycles and mass accumulations from the community. The whale holds $52 million worth of assets after raking in $109 million in profits. This transaction follows previous trends from other whales dumping the asset. On Dec 16, 43 billion tokens were transferred to an unknown wallet, raising community reactions. Meme coins are susceptible to high swings because of prices and market structure. Rally After The Storm Amid a downtrend, meme coins can spark a frenzy on a wider crypto bulk cycle. SHIB bulls remain optimistic for an uphill run, which U.S. institutional investors will likely spark . Before the dip, the asset soared above 90% since the United States elections. Market bulls poured funds into meme coins in expectation of easing regulations in the country, a catalyst to drive the next upward momentum. Similarly, institutional investors also moved assets to reposition ahead of next year’s projections. Crypto enthusiasts investinghaven explained the possibility of a turnaround on X (formerly Twitter). “$ SHIB: 2025 Price Outlook This chart shows Shiba Inu’s price could peak near $0.0000998 in 2025, while the potential low is at $0.0000234. The path to these targets may see volatility, but it reflects broader crypto market trends. Patience could pay off for #SHIB.” Another factor that could spur increased accumulation is the altcoin season . This is characterized by fund flows from Bitcoin to other assets in a cycle. Several analysts have tipped an incoming altcoin season this month as whales move assets to other assets.

Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, competes with Ethereum's ETH. Users can store value, make payments, and stake on the Cardano network. Cardano uses the energy-efficient Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, unlike the energy-intensive proof-of-work model. It divides its blockchain into two layers: one for transactions and one for smart contracts. This enhances its ability to process up to a million transactions per second. Cardano tokens, introduced in March 2021, offer secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts. This sets a new benchmark for blockchain efficiency and scalability. Given its technological advances and sustainable approach, ADA looks attractive in the current market cycle. Polkadot (DOT): Connecting Blockchains for a More Scalable Future Polkadot (DOT) is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency that enables secure communication between different blockchains. It allows value and data to be shared across blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin without intermediaries. Polkadot uses parachains to improve speed and scalability, processing more transactions than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The DOT token is used for governance and staking, letting holders participate in development and transaction verification. Developed by Gavin Wood, a co-founder of Ethereum, and launched on May 26, 2020, Polkadot aims to create more interconnected and efficient blockchains. In the current market cycle, Polkadot's technology and potential to enhance blockchain interoperability continue to draw interest. Conclusion In the current bull run, while ADA and DOT have less short-term potential, DOGEN offers massive growth. Designed for those seeking luxury and success, it expects 700% presale growth with potential thousand-fold returns. Following tokens like BONK, DOGEN builds a community of market leaders and offers real value through exclusive perks for early adopters.

PEPE technical analysis is currently a focal point, emphasizing its steady presence around a $10 billion market cap, igniting discussions about its future prospects. Similarly, the Aave price prediction is gaining traction, suggesting it might steadily ascend to $351, supported by continuous adoption and innovations in DeFi. However, the most electrifying news revolves around BlockDAG (BDAG) , which has shattered all expectations with its extraordinary achievements in 2024, positioning itself as a top-performing crypto project of the year. This cutting-edge layer-1 blockchain platform has amassed an impressive $173 million in presale, reached critical technological benchmarks, and secured major partnerships. PEPE Technical Analysis: 2025 Expectations PEPE has consistently held a $10 billion market cap, leading to speculations about its expansion capabilities. Analysts foresee a 226% increase by early 2025 if it can surpass the resistance at $0.000032, although this is heavily dependent on ongoing market interest. Recent statistics showing $2.61 billion moving out of exchanges indicate a tightening supply that could influence future price movements. However, PEPE’s reliance on speculative market trends suggests potential vulnerabilities to fluctuations. Despite its current drive, the debate continues over PEPE’s long-term status as a top-performing crypto, given its speculative nature and dependency on community enthusiasm. Why Aave Price Prediction is Showing Ascent? Aave has been steadily expanding its DeFi ecosystem, now boasting $22 billion in total value locked and pioneering innovations such as the GHO stablecoin. Current Aave price predictions suggest a possible rise to $351, fueled by recent growth, including a 13% increase and enhanced user engagement. Daily transaction counts of 5,772 and growing protocol adoption highlight its vital role in DeFi. However, challenges are present. An RSI of 71.63 points to near-overbought conditions, sparking sustainability concerns. Although its diversified approach boosts its allure, escalating competition within DeFi could threaten its growth path. BlockDAG’s Explosive Growth in 2024: $173M Presale and 2240% ROI! In 2024, BlockDAG emerged as one of the most rapidly expanding cryptocurrencies, heralding a dynamic era in blockchain technology. Introduced as an ambitious project, it quickly gained traction through its advanced blockchain solutions and a scalable approach. Its groundbreaking presale attracted over 170,000 participants, amassing more than $173 million very quickly. The presale began in 2024, coinciding with the launch of the X-series miners—cutting-edge mining equipment designed to maximize profits. To date, BlockDAG has sold more than 15,000 of these rigs, earning over $6 million from these sales, bolstering its popularity among miners. Strategic partnerships have played a crucial role in its journey, with collaborations like the one with Inter Milan propelling BlockDAG into the global spotlight. A pivotal moment occurred when BlockDAG rolled out its Testnet ahead of schedule, enabling developers and enterprises to trial its leading-edge no-code smart contract platforms. Following this, it swiftly completed its Mainnet, which is currently under audit before its eagerly anticipated launch. BlockDAG’s presale success, with daily inflows reaching $5 million, illustrates the profound impact of its achievements. Early participants have witnessed a phenomenal 2,240% growth in their stakes, with BDAG’s price escalating from $0.001 to $0.0234 in the latest presale phase. As BlockDAG approaches its $600 million presale goal, it stands out as one of the fastest-growing presale events in cryptocurrency history. Its significant milestones and robust presale drive have spurred discussions about tier-1 exchange listings, potentially boosting the value of its native coin, BDAG. For those considering this burgeoning crypto endeavor, the opportunity is ripe, with BDAG still available at just $0.0234. However, the chance to join is narrowing as the current presale batch is nearly sold out, with an impending price increase in the next phase. Leaders in Cryptocurrency Performance As PEPE technical analysis signals possible growth driven by speculative interest and Aave price prediction indicates a steady ascent toward $351, attention is drawn to BlockDAG’s remarkable progress in 2024. With over $173 million secured in presale funds and a staggering 2,240% ROI delivered to early participants, BlockDAG is redefining success as one of the top-performing crypto projects this year. Its approaching exchange listings and progress toward a $600 million presale target significantly bolster BDAG, marking now as the ideal time to engage with this promising project before it escalates further.

38200333,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99431,1735336702,Coinbase Sees Record Bitcoin Outflow as Whales Move $1.1 Billion BTC in 1 Hour,"Crypto exchange Coinbase recorded the highest outflow last week, with 10,756 Bitcoin (BTC) withdrawn in one hour. The total volume was worth approximately $1.1 billion, sparking slight bull signals in the market. Crypto whales and institutional investors have picked up huge assets, buying the dip and setting sights on another rally. CryptoQuant analysts highlighted a set of massive outflows from centralized exchanges. Coinbase saw the largest volume following the Fed’s cutting interest rates. The first block contained 8,093 BTC, while the second 2,557 BTC before the hour. Outflows from centralized exchanges point to improved market sentiments as users seek long-term holdings. Meanwhile, flows to these exchanges often result in offloads due to ease of transaction. As a result, the market faces high sell pressure on mounting inflows to Binance and Coinbase. Institutional Players Lead Buys Recent Bitcoin buys amid the market dip have come from institutional investors. Retail holders have sold assets to notch gains in the last seven days after the crypto leader touched all-time highs. However, most traditional and bigger players are holding on a long-term basis ahead of positive macro factors in the United States. Recent outflows from exchanges occurred after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced interest rate cuts. On Dec 18, the US central bank slashed policy rates by 25 basis points, taking figures to lowest levels since February 2023. This follows slowing inflationary trends adding to crypto investments. Rate cuts lead to more inflows as investors pour funds into risky assets. CryptoQuant analysts explained recent activity was linked to spot Bitcoin ETFs and other institutional activity. This signals a strong rebound for Bitcoin price in 2024, coupled with recent projections by stakeholders. “ The scale of this transaction strongly indicates institutional buying (RIOT and MARA) or intermediary purchases for Spot ETF demand, consistent with similar activity observed over the past year. Such movements highlight the growing influence of institutional players in the Bitcoin market. U.S. investors continue to accumulate Bitcoin relentlessly, undeterred by price fluctuations or market downturns.” Bitcoin miner Hut 8 purchased 990 Bitcoin worth approximately $100 million, boosting its reserve above $1 billion. The company noted it aligns with its strategy to merge low-cost BTC mining with buying opportunities.

One of those trends just happened to be crypto rug pulls. In the third episode, player 333, Lee Myeong-gi, was concerned that they took his phone because he wanted to keep his eye on the crypto market. The guy turned out to be an influencer who apparently was involved in rug-pulling a bunch of the other players. document.createElement('video'); https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/nB-mC05cYu-3m4Q-.mp4 They were pretty mad, they even beat him up for it right off the bat. Per their conversation, thousands of people were scammed by the token’s creators, who were now chilling abroad with the billions of won they stole. Did Squid Game let down fans with its second season? Most fans have not enjoyed the second season of Squid Game. One look at its Twitter (X) hashtag will tell you that. But for those who never tuned in to the iconic show, allow us to give you a full spoiler. It’s a story about a couple of white billionaires who just find it entertaining to bet on human lives in survival children’s games. They send out a guy to scout players, mostly in train stations. The people they find are always in debt and/or even homeless. He then tells them to play a children’s game with him. If they win, he’ll give them money. If you win, he’ll give you a card and tell you to call him if you are interested in playing more games like this and making insane amounts of money. Of course, they say yes. They are then given a card with a number on it to call, and then get knocked out and taken to an isolated island where they are put in green tracksuits and made to play ludicrous games like Red Light, Green Light. You lose, you die. A character, Seong Gi-hun (player 456), won the game in season 1, though mostly out of luck. In season 2, he gets angry and comes back to the island by finding the train station guy. Why? To take revenge. The season ended on a cliffhanger, and it is not looking good for our unfit hero at all. However, throughout the games, the victims of that rug pull kept bringing it up and cussing the creators out. Censored screenshot from Netflix. Credits: Cryptopolitan Crypto was mentioned a lot. The name of the coin is Dalmatian (DAL) and the victims said the influencer told them to invest everything they had in it because it was definitely “going to the moon.” But get this. A real-life rug pull actually happened using the movie. Oh yes. Scammers launched a coin called Squid Game (SQUID) and stole tens of thousands of dollars just like that. How hilarious is that?

Thanks to community-driven efforts and speculative frenzy, these meme coins exploded in price. Now, investors are turning their attention to Yeti Ouro (YETIO) and believe it could mirror their achievements in the upcoming weeks if not eclipse. Yeti Ouro presents a distinguished addition to the market with its stimulating features and integration into the Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming experience. In the meantime, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are still alive, but their growth is not as pronounced as that of new coins. Gaming Focused, Utility Dominating Contender: Yeti Ouro Yeti Ouro: Unlike Your Typical Meme Coin, A Utility-Based Cryptocurrency Set To Profit P2E Gaming with a supply limit of 1 billion tokens, Yeti Ouro creates scarcity for an active digital asset appealing to investors and gamers alike. Key Features of Yeti Ouro: Yeti Go Integration: The Yeti Go racing game is an Unreal Engine-powered, high-octane racing game with Player-vs-Player (PvP) racing, power-ups, environmental challenges, and rewards. Players can stake Yeti Ouro tokens and earn while gaming. Burn Mechanism and Tokenomics: Yeti Ouro implements token burn mechanism to limit supply with every transaction in-game to ensure value. This adds to its deflationary nature. In-Game Utility: Players will use Yeti Ouro to buy power-ups, unlock unique game modes, or enter in-person tournaments. Marketplace and Staking — Yeti Go has a marketplace where players can exchange in-game assets and staking mechanisms that provide holders with passive income. With $1.46 million passing in Stage 2 of Yeti Ouro’s presale, the excitement keeps mounting. Given that the token is further embedded into the P2E ecosystem, early investors expect legendary market-to-market crossover. Dogecoin: The OG Meme Coin That Still Works Often referred to as the “grandfather of meme coins,” Dogecoin gained notoriety during the 2021 bull run. Originally invented as a joke, Dogecoin’s strong community and celebrity endorsements — not least on Twitter by Elon Musk — sent it soaring to astronomical heights. 1-month Dogecoin price chart- source: CoinMarketCap Dogecoin's Strengths: Broad Acceptance: Dogecoin is accepted by numerous businesses for payment. Community-Driven: A devoted fanbase lingers on, providing its ongoing vitality. Liquidity and Accessibility — With a market cap of over $46 billion, Dogecoin is the most actively traded cryptocurrency. But Dogecoin has no utility other than being a medium of exchange with Dogecoin price at $0.3156 at time of writing. The restriction has prompted some investors to venture into tokens like Yeti Ouro, which have more potential for practical use and expansion. Shiba Inu: The “Dogecoin Killer” Looks To Grow Its Utility Shiba Inu was launched as its rival, with the label “Dogecoin Killer.” Starving its canine counterpart's popularity, 2021 witnessed explosive growth for Shiba Inu. Today, it’s turning toward more utility with projects like Shibarium, a layer-2 blockchain solution. 1-month Shiba Inu price chart- source: CoinMarketCap Shiba Inu’s Notable Features: Ecosystem Growth: The birth of a ShibaSwap and the upcoming Metaverse project highlights the expanding nature of the Shiba ecosystem. Use Cases: The Shiba token was designed as a meme token. Tokenomics: With a total supply of over 589 trillion tokens, it is super accessible and possible to hinder massive price increases. While Shiba Inu innovates, Yeti Ouro’s combination of gaming and tokenomics sees it miles ahead regarding use case potential. Why Yeti Ouro Is Set Up For Success Whereas Dogecoin and Shiba Inu depend on the motive of community hype, Yeti Ouro combines utility, scarcity, and real-world application. Its strategic positioning in the booming P2E gaming market presents a huge upside potential. This repeated interest is changing to find through the proceeding presale, which has raised its significant capital reason to believe it is a further sign that the investors are confident. With an increasing number of gamers using Yeti Go while making in-game transactions powered by Yeti Ouro tokens, demand is set to increase alongside value. Overall, with gaming integration unique tokenomics, and great presale activity, Yeti Ouro will undoubtedly become a strong investment choice for 2024 and beyond. Conclusion Yeti Ouro stands to outperform its competitors, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, with its unique utility-meets-gaming approach. With the presale already gaining momentum, early investors are wagering heavily on its ability to replicate the meteoric rise enjoyed by its predecessors.

Take 1973, for instance, when the economic slump rattled global markets. Amid the chaos, savvy investors bought the dip and emerged with fortunes. Fast forward to today, and BTFD Coin —a cheeky nod to “buy the dip”—offers a modern chance to multiply gains. With a high-flying presale already surpassing $4.6 million and a jaw-dropping potential ROI of 837.5% when it lists at $0.0006, it’s a coin that demands attention. Oh, and don’t forget to use the BIG50 bonus code for 50% extra coins. This is your moment to seize. Over the years, meme coins have gone from being a joke to a phenomenon. From Dogecoin’s meteoric rise to Shiba Inu’s loyal fanbase, these coins have proven their staying power. What started as internet humour has transformed into serious market movers. Investors love them for their community-driven growth and viral potential. In 2024, the meme coin craze shows no signs of slowing, with BTFD Coin leading a new wave of innovation. But BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin; it’s set to redefine the genre. With a play-to-earn (P2E) game , a rewarding referral programme, staking opportunities, and a strong community vibe, this coin has all the makings of a blockbuster hit. As we dive into the best new meme coins to invest in for short term gains, you’ll see why BTFD Coin is stealing the spotlight alongside other quirky contenders like Peanut the Squirrel and Snek. BTFD Coin Offering Big Deal: The Bullish Favourite BTFD Coin isn’t playing around. Currently in its 13th presale stage, this meme coin is smashing records. Over 60 billion $BTFD coins have already been sold, with more than 6,900 holders—dubbed “Bulls”—joining the charge. At its current price of $0.000142, it’s a steal. What makes it even sweeter? The BIG50 bonus code. Enter this during your purchase, and you’ll get 50% extra coins. It’s like finding extra fries at the bottom of the bag—but way better. BTFD Coin’s presale performance has been nothing short of phenomenal. It hit $1 million within 10 days of launch, doubled that to $2.5 million in 14 days, and now sits comfortably above $4.6 million. Analysts predict that its price could soar to $0.0006 by the end of the presale, offering early investors a staggering 837.5% ROI. For example, let’s say you invest $50,000 today at $0.000142. That nets you approximately 352,112,676 $BTFD coins. When the price hits $0.0006, your investment balloons to $211,267—not too shabby for a short-term play. But there’s more to this coin than just numbers. Its ecosystem is built for sustainability and fun. The P2E game promises to keep users engaged while the staking feature rewards long-term holders. Add a referral programme that gives back generously, and you’ve got a recipe for a community-powered juggernaut. If you’re looking for the best new meme coins to invest in for short term gains, BTFD Coin should be at the top of your list. Peanut the Squirrel’s Cute Comeback: Nostalgia Meets Innovation Remember the days when Peanut the Squirrel memes ruled the internet? Well, this nostalgic icon is back, and it’s bringing its charm to the crypto world. Peanut’s team has crafted a meme coin that’s as endearing as its namesake. But don’t let the cuteness fool you—this coin has serious potential. Unlike other meme coins that rely solely on hype, Peanut the Squirrel is building a decentralised ecosystem aimed at fostering creativity. Its primary use case? Supporting digital artists and content creators. Think of it as Patreon meets crypto, but with a playful twist. Users can tip creators using $PEANUT, participate in NFT drops, and even unlock exclusive content. The community-driven approach ensures that Peanut’s value grows organically. Peanut’s comeback has been met with enthusiasm, especially among millennials and Gen Z. Its presale is gaining traction, and analysts believe it could double its initial value within months of launch. The coin’s nostalgic appeal, combined with its innovative platform, makes it a strong contender among the best new meme coins to invest in for short term gains. If you’ve ever laughed at a Peanut meme, this might just be your next big investment. Snek Sneaking Up: The Underestimated Underdog At first glance, Snek might not seem like much. But underestimate this slithering meme coin at your peril. Inspired by the classic mobile game Snake, Snek combines nostalgia with a fresh twist. Its goal? To gamify crypto trading in a way that’s both fun and profitable. Snek’s unique selling point lies in its trading game. Users can earn $SNEK by participating in daily trading challenges, completing tasks, and achieving high scores. The gamified approach has struck a chord with younger investors who love the thrill of competition. And with its sleek interface and addictive gameplay, Snek is quickly building a loyal following. The coin’s presale has been gaining momentum, and experts predict a sharp rise in value post-launch. With its innovative gaming model and strong community engagement, Snek is poised to become one of the best new meme coins to invest in for short term profits. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a curious newbie, Snek offers an exciting way to dip your toes into the crypto waters. How to Get Started with BTFD Coin Go to the Presale Page .

To end Season 1 in grand style, the game distributed $2 million worth of Secret Points (SP) to players, showing dedication to providing value and rewards to its loyal community. The Token Generation Event (TGE) is just ahead, and according to the HashCats Telegram channel , there’s only a limited time left to earn SP through exciting contests and giveaways. Why Secret Points (SP) Matter Secret Points (SP) is the game’s fresh new token valued at $10 each, and players can earn them through various in-game actions, tasks, events, and invites. When the TGE takes place, SP will be converted into the game’s native tokens, creating a bridge between in-game achievements and real-world utility. Season 1, which was all about building a mining empire, set the stage by distributing millions of dollars in SP, giving players a clear incentive to stay active. With the launch of Season 2, which is all about playing smart and not hard, new opportunities have arisen to earn even more SP and other valuable rewards. Season 2 – Deeper Strategy, Expanded Teamwork, Higher Rewards Season 2 has officially landed , and so far, it seems packed with plenty of enhanced features. From managing just one ASIC, players will now expand to run a whole mining farm, adding layers to the strategy. In Season 2, players are able to upgrade their miners and cats, involve up to four miners in their mining farm, and stake HASH to earn RedHASH and Diamonds – the rarest and most valuable tokens in the game. One of the most interesting updates is the launch of Team Challenges, where players can join forces, compete, and pocket up to $100 in just 2-3 days. These limited-time events bring a new level of strategy and coordination, as players collaborate to earn as many points as possible and climb the leaderboard. Rewards for top-performing teams include Secret Points (SP) and CHO – Choise.ai’s native token , which offers additional value in the HashCats game, too – providing significant incentives for teams to work together. Now, players can keep earning both SP and CHO through these Team Challenges, extending the opportunities to grow their rewards. The Upcoming TGE HashCats teased that the upcoming TGE is on the horizon. SP will be converted into tokens of equal value during this event, giving players who’ve been involved in every season a big chance to benefit from their dedication and involvement in the game. As the TGE nears, now is the final window to join HashCats and begin building up SP. With Season 2 offering even more ways to earn, joining right away means getting a head start on accumulating rewards that could pay off in the near future. Why HashCats is Different HashCats offers an exciting way to earn and build wealth in the blockchain ecosystem. With new features constantly being added, it’s quickly becoming one of the most notable and rewarding projects in the T2E industry. With the beginning of Season 2 and the TGE fast approaching, players have a prime chance to gather rewards. HashCats also plans to offer educational resources through the HashCats Academy, in addition to a proprietary blockchain and mechanisms for staking and farming, creating a platform designed for long-term user engagement. By implementing these plans, they aim to introduce new ways for players to earn and learn. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

According to ChangeNOW, transaction volumes for these cryptocurrencies have risen. ChangeNOW is a service that allows crypto exchanges without registration, favored by savvy investors and whales concerned about security. The increase in transactions suggests investors are accumulating these coins, indicating potential growth ahead. Toncoin Flirts with Bullish Momentum Amid Price Fluctuations Toncoin is currently trading between $4.61 and $6.31, showing signs of potential bullish momentum. The 1-week price increase of 5.99% hints at growing buyer interest. The 10-day simple moving average is $5.82, slightly above the 100-day average of $5.66, suggesting a possible upward trend. With the nearest resistance level at $7.24, breaking this could lead to the next target of $8.93—an increase of over 40% from current prices. Technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index at 42.03 and a stochastic value of 22.76 indicate that Toncoin is nearing oversold territory, which often precedes price increases. Overall, the current technical setup points toward a market leaning in favor of the bulls. On ChangeNOW, a custody-free platform that requires no registration, interested parties can buy or exchange TON. >>> ChangeNOW - Swap Crypto Simple, Fast, Free of Custody Monero's Market Gains Momentum Amid Positive Price Movement Monero (XMR) has experienced significant growth over the past month, with prices increasing by over 23%. Currently trading between $160 and $227, the cryptocurrency shows potential for further gains. The next resistance level is at $263, with a second resistance at $329, suggesting possible targets if the upward trend continues. Both the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are around $192, indicating steady momentum. Technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index at 50 and Stochastic at 57 point to neutral market conditions. Despite a slight dip of 9% in the past week, the overall six-month increase of nearly 15% underscores Monero's upward trajectory. Monero is available on platforms like ChangeNOW without registration or hidden fees. >>> ChangeNOW - Swap Crypto Simple, Fast, Free of Custody Solana's Price Dip Suggests Potential Upswing Amid Oversold Signals Solana (SOL) has seen its price range between $161 and $214 recently, with a drop of over 8% in the past week and nearly 19% over the past month. Despite this downturn, SOL's six-month change remains a positive 36%. Technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index at around 32 and Stochastic near 10 suggest that SOL may be oversold. The nearest support level is at $141, and if the price holds above this, it could rebound toward resistance levels at $249 and potentially $302. This possible upward movement represents a significant percentage increase. The current market setup appears favorable for Solana which is available for purchase on ChangeNOW without registration and hidden fees. >>> ChangeNOW - Swap Crypto Simple, Fast, Free of Custody Conclusion TON, XMR, and SOL each present unique opportunities for investors and traders.

38199647,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634151,1735335002,Upbit premium climbs higher as South Korean won slides to 15-year low against the US dollar,"Bitcoin (BTC) trades at an expanding premium on Upbit, as South Korean traders seek protection from the weakening national currency. Traders bought BTC as the South Korean won fell to a 15-year low against the US dollar. Bitcoin traded with a widening premium on Upbit, one of the leading South Korean exchanges. While a premium on the Korean won pair is not unusual, this time, the disparity is growing. BTC traded at $94,574.92 on most spot exchanges. On Upbit, the price was $96,722.63, keeping a gap of more than $2,000. The Bithumb premium was lower, with BTC trading at $96,571.21. Other trading pairs remained within their usual range, with minimal fluctuation. The South Korean won premium increased rapidly on worries about currency devaluation. | Source: Cryptoquant The Korean won markets make up just 1.78% of all BTC trading activity. More than 24.83% of trading is against the US dollar, while 51.46% is against USDT, with an intuitive dollar-based position. Usually, the premium rises smoothly with the rest of the market, but the latest spike of the Korean won index signals a short-term rush to buy BTC. The Korean won slid more rapidly against the dollar from October onward, accelerating its decline and causing a shift to BTC as an offset. Investors in South Korea flock to crypto in Q4 The Korean won has returned to levels not seen since the 2008 financial crisis, sparking worries about South Korea’s economy. The country is one of the key crypto hubs, where retail demand is high as a way to offset stagnant incomes. Based on recent data from the Bank of Korea, domestic crypto investors exceeded 15 million for the first time. While South Korean investors have been highly active in previous bull cycles, the latest increase in activity started in the last months of 2024. Following the US elections and the accelerated losses of the won against the dollar, an additional 610K South Koreans made their first crypto purchases. As a result, roughly 30% of all South Koreans have invested in crypto coins. Crypto investors used the top 5 centralized exchanges in the country, Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and GOPAX. The exchanges are mostly closed to outside investors without a bank account in the country, which does not allow international traders to arbitrage easily. Those markets are also relatively conservative in listing new coins and tokens, so BTC still rules as an alternative investment. South Korea added another layer of regulations under the Virtual Asset User Protection Act, which came into force in July. The new regulations also meant the country’s central bank tracked the crypto market more closely. This allowed the Bank of Korea to track the growth of crypto investors in the country for the first time. According to Representative Lim Gwang-hyun of the Democratic Party of Korea, crypto markets are catching up to traditional stock markets in terms of volumes and retail activity. Volumes on South Korean virtual asset exchanges reached the equivalent of $100B in November, surpassing the country’s KOSPI and KOSDAQ markets. Inflows to exchanges also accelerated in the past three months, showing demand for risky assets with high potential returns. South Korean traders have increased inflows to centralized exchanges every month in the past year. The trend accelerated in the past few weeks, after the incident of declaring martial law for two hours, raising questions about the country’s political stability. There were also signs that crypto markets were not only catching up to stock markets, but investors were shifting their funds from shares into digital coins. Additionally, the KOSDAQ index has been sliding in the year to date, starting from 871 points in January and posting losses down to 675 points as of December 27. Since tracking began, the number of new investors grew on average by 100K users a month. Total holdings for South Korean investors were around 58 trillion won in July, rising to over 100 trillion at the end of 2024, based on the BTC rally to a series of records. In the second half of 2024, individual holdings on average were under $2,500, doubling to over $5,000 after the Q4 rally.

38199716,https://blockworks.co/news/ai-agents-solana-hackathon,1735335000,‘Agents’ swarm inaugural Solana AI hackathon,"This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . The inaugural Solana AI hackathon concluded on Monday. Over 400 projects threw their respective hats in the ring for a contest offering cash prizes but more importantly the prospect of potentially-lucrative attention to so-called AI agents, which are currently flooding crypto social feeds. Multiple entrants already have tokens trading at millions of dollars-worth of market cap, and agent copilots for crypto trading as well as AI agent “swarms” were buzzy categories. Winners of the hackathon, organized by SendAI, will be announced around Jan. 10, SendAI co-founder and CEO Yash Agarwal told me. A list of entrants and relevant details is expected to be posted later today. Hackathons are common in Solanaland, but what makes this one unique is the number of contestant tokens already trading. The total market capitalization of Solana AI agent hackathon tokens has crossed $200 million, Agarwal told me. That’s roughly the size of Solana DeFi protocol Orca’s native token. One such project is FXN, a so-called AI swarm whose native token briefly touched $70 million in market cap after launching around Dec. 11. It currently has roughly $44 million in market cap, according to DEX Screener. FXN is a protocol that lets multiple AI agents work together to accomplish more than what a single agent is capable of, according to a white paper dated Oct. 3, 2024. The white paper gives a sample use case of a group of agents essentially operating as a social media marketing firm to create and promote social content. AI agents tied to crypto tokens exploded in popularity after an unhinged social media chatbot with a token went viral in October . The number of entrants in a hackathon announced just two weeks before it began underscores how much competition for mindshare there is among crypto AI projects. Many projects share a “similar focus” of creating an “intelligent interface for the Solana ecosystem,” Potatoe, the anonymous lead developer of a hackathon project called Project Plutus, told me. Users don’t need AI bots who execute actions that they could do themselves, which is why Project Plutus built an AI companion that watches charts and can trade while users are away, they added. There do appear to be a lot of trading-focused agents based on an initial list that was shared with me by the hackathon’s organizers. “The Solana AI Hackathon underscores how on-chain trading and DeFi are emerging as key verticals for AI agents. These use cases will likely drive innovation in Q1 and Q2 2025,” the X threader 0xJeff wrote . Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address – 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONPRIN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/prince-elon-elonprin-memecoin-will-explode-13000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana and Cardano capture institutional attention as analysts rank 1Fuel as a promising altcoin. Table of Contents Solana gets a new wave of institutional interest Cardano could see major rally 1Fuel: New altcoin with high growth potential Conclusion It’s been a busy December in the cryptocurrency market. Solana (SOL) is in the spotlight with a new wave of institutional interest, Cardano (ADA) is showing recovery, and 1Fuel (OFT) crossed the $850,000 mark. With potential for 500x returns, 1Fuel stands out as a project combining privacy and utility. Its technological enhancements and marketplace placement have encouraged analysts to rank it among the altcoins to watch for 2025. Solana gets a new wave of institutional interest Since the beginning, Solana has piqued the interest of traditional institutions dipping their toes into crypto. Partnerships with Microsoft and Google Cloud have been a big part of SOL’s growth, as it has grown 37,800% from its all-time low price of $0.505. Recently, SOL has experienced a new wave of interest from institutional investors in the form of Solana-based ETFs (exchange-traded funds). Prominent names like Grayscale and 21Shares have filed for Solana-based ETFs with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). ETFs have historically contributed to huge inflows and major market activity. In January 2024, when Bitcoin ETFs were approved, BTC rose by 181.52%. Moreover, its assets under management surged to $110.72 billion. If the ETF filings are approved, SOL could have a significant surge ahead. Cardano could see major rally After an extended period of sideways action, Cardano rallied upward, currently trading at $0.90. This rebound has been inline with the increased on-chain activities and dApp adoption on Cardano’s ecosystem. Cardano has also been enjoying institutional attention. Recently, its founder, Charles Hoskinson was involved in discussing crypto U.S. policy. There is speculation that Hoskinson could be appointed as Trump’s advisor. In contrast to many other projects, Cardano has consistently delivered on its roadmap. This has increased trust and inspired bullish sentiment among enthusiasts. Investors see it as a top project for long-term returns. If the momentum continues, analysts believe ADA can break the $10 mark. You might also like: Ethereum at $3,300 level while 1Fuel outpaces ADA in presale growth 1Fuel: New altcoin with high growth potential Crypto investors have identified 1FUEL as an emerging gem, with its presale generating a buzz as it enters the second stage. 1FUEL has secured over $850,000 and sold more than 90 million tokens. This privacy-focused wallet is establishing itself in the crypto space, aiming to drive the future of crypto transactions. By facilitating communication between a single wallet and multiple blockchains, 1FUEL will address a key limitation users face. Moreover, it will support broad token compatibility and provide a streamlined user experience. The need for cross-chain functionality has become increasingly apparent. Although wallets like Ledger and Phantom have such features, 1FUEL has a distinct advantage. It will enable users to seamlessly swap, transact, and manage digital assets across multiple blockchains with just 1 click. Priority for security and confidentiality sets 1FUEL apart from other crypto wallets. The platform will feature a built-in privacy mixer to ensure transaction confidentiality. Moreover, cross-chain P2P transactions put 1FUEL ahead of the competition making it among the best crypto to buy. Conclusion Cardano and Solana have piqued the interest of institutional investors. On the other hand, 1FUEL has been setting new records in its ongoing presale. With its utility focused approach, transformative tools, and impressive presale momentum, 1FUEL is the altcoin to watch for 2025. To discover more about 1FUEL, visit their website , Telegram , or X .

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. With Bitcoin eyeing $150,000, these 5 altcoins are gearing up for massive gains. Table of Contents DOGEN sees 333% surge, targets 500% by TGE Ethereum TRON BNB Solana Conclusion As the end of year approaches, excitement builds in the cryptocurrency world. Bitcoin is setting its sights on a historic price level, and several lesser-known coins are showing signs of massive growth. This article analyzes 5 altcoins that could experience remarkable surges, capturing the attention of investors looking for the next big opportunity. DOGEN sees 333% surge, targets 500% by TGE DOGEN, a rising meme coin on the Solana blockchain, is capturing attention with its impressive presale performance and growth potential. Inspired by the viral success of tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN combines meme culture appeal with Solana’s scalability to stand out in the booming altcoin market. Starting at $0.0003 in Stage 1, the token has already surged by 333% to $0.0013 in Stage 9. With the presale progressing toward Stage 13, the price is projected to hit $0.0019, delivering a potential 500% return for early adopters. DOGEN’s multi-level referral program offers three tiers of rewards: 7% in USDT for direct referrals, 2% for second-tier, and 1% for third-tier purchases. Weekly distributions incentivize consistent community engagement. Additionally, DOGEN’s Golden Points system rewards investors with bonus airdrops based on the size of their investments, offering up to a 12% boost for purchases over $10,000. DOGEN’s strong community focus, combined with its solid presale growth and future utility, positions it as a compelling option in the Solana ecosystem. Interested investors can be part of DOGEN’s exciting future via presale. Ethereum Ethereum is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain known for smart contracts and a wide range of decentralized applications. It remains the second-largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $400.69 billion. ETH is currently trading at $3,326.28, reflecting a decline of 2.65% over the past week and 6.68% in the past month. Over the past 24 hours, the ETH trading volume has surged by 27.15% to $25.23 billion, with a volume-to-market-cap ratio of 6.29%. Analysts suggest that while Ethereum remains 32.37% below its all-time high of $4,891.70, it has the potential to regain and surpass these levels in the near future. TRON TRON is a decentralized blockchain platform launched in 2017 by the Tron Foundation. The value TRX saw a notable surge in early December, hitting a record high of $0.4407 on December 4. However, TRX is currently trading at $0.2593 — a decline of almost 40% from its recent peak. Even with the drop, Tron remains 29.79% higher than it was a month ago and has risen by 5.45% over the past week. Over the last 24 hours, the TRX price increased by 3.56%, becoming a top performer among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Technical indicators suggest that TRX is finding stability with a promising outlook. Key support levels include the Major Oblique Support at $0.246 and the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $0.23915, both of which could bolster a potential breakout. On the resistance side, the Bollinger Upper Band at $0.31 aligns with recent highs, and a breakout above this point could signal a strong bullish trend for Tron. You might also like: XRP targets $10 and $35, Dogen excites investors with projected 15,900% surge BNB BNB , the native cryptocurrency of the Binance ecosystem, is currently trading at $692.63, reflecting an increase of 2.88% over the past week and 8.48% in the last 30 days. With a market cap of $99.74 billion, BNB has shown strong momentum, supported by a 56.86% surge in 24-hour trading volume to $1.91 billion. On December 22, BNB fell beneath the 50-day SMA at $658 but the bears failed to push below the key support level at $635. The bulls are currently working to initiate a recovery rally, which is likely to encounter resistance near the 20-day EMA at $685. Should the price reverse from this level, the bears might make another attempt to drag BNB below the uptrend line, potentially triggering a decline toward $550. Conversely, if the price surpasses the 20-day EMA, it would indicate that the pair might consolidate within the $635 to $722 range for a while. A breakout and close above $722 would signal that the bulls have regained control. Solana SOL is currently valued at $185.85, reflecting a decline of nearly 3% over the past 24 hours. The asset’s market cap and trading volume have also shown signs of a bearish trend. Despite the downward price movement, the Net Realized Profit/Loss metric for SOL indicates that investors maintain a strong bullish outlook. The 0.78 Fibonacci retracement level has acted as solid support for SOL. As the price approaches the 0.618 retracement level near $197, the support range between $181.75 and $179.66 becomes critical in shaping its next move. If the recent boost in investor confidence and increased activity on the Solana network continues, SOL could aim for $254 as its first target. Additional medium-term targets projected by analysts include $302 and $345. Conclusion With Bitcoin aiming for new heights, established coins like ETH, TRX, BNB, and SOL may offer steady gains, but DOGEN stands out with its focus on luxury and success. By building a community of ambitious leaders and offering exclusive perks to early adopters, DOGEN presents significant potential in the altcoin season.

Montenegro’s Justice Minister, Bojan Božović, has recently signed off on his extradition. This followed months of deliberation and a ruling from the Supreme Court of Montenegro. This decision marks a pivotal moment in the global crackdown on financial crimes tied to the volatile world of digital currencies. The Decision: U.S. Over South Korea After initially dismissing the extradition appeal, Montenegro’s Supreme Court has now cleared the path for Do Kwon’s extradition. This came after evaluating requests from both the United States and South Korea. In its statement, the Ministry of Justice emphasized the meticulous review process for Kwon’s extradition approval. The Ministry noted that the decision considered the Supreme Court’s ruling. Also, factors like the seriousness of the crimes and the order of requests were considered. This thorough review guided their final decision. Ultimately, most legal conditions favored the U.S. claim. Kwon was accused of causing a massive crypto collapse that erased $40 billion in value and affected countless investors globally. This devastating impact led the Ministry to prioritize the U.S. request, where authorities aim to hold him accountable. The TerraUSD and Luna Collapse: A Ripple Effect In May 2022, Kwon’s digital tokens, TerraUSD and Luna, collapsed, causing massive financial losses. The crash wiped out $40 billion from the global crypto market and left millions of investors in financial ruin. The impact was felt across the crypto world, leading to bankruptcies and revealing weaknesses in the market. Investigations by U.S. and South Korean authorities revealed Kwon played a key role in misleading investors. He was also accused of hiding large wealth, suggesting intentional deception. The losses extended beyond numbers, with countless individuals losing life savings due to Kwon’s promises of stability in an unstable market. The Do Kwon Arrest and Detention in Montenegro Kwon’s downfall became international news on March 23, 2023. He and his business partner, Han Chang-Joon, were arrested at Podgorica Airport. They tried to escape to Dubai with fake passports but were caught and later sentenced to four months in prison for forgery. Upon his release from Montenegro’s Spuž prison, Kwon was handed over to the foreign nationals’ inspectorate for intense interrogation. He now resides in the Foreigners’ Shelter, awaiting the final execution of his extradition to the U.S. For millions of investors and the crypto industry, the extradition signals a crucial step toward justice. As Do Kwon prepares to face American courts, the world is watching for future outcomes.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Attention turns to Kaspa and XYZVerse as Solana and Ethereum consolidate. Table of Contents XYZVerse gears up for January’s market shift Solana Ethereum Kaspa Conclusion While Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) remain steady with little price movement, attention is turning to Kaspa (KAS) and XYZVerse (XYZ). These cryptocurrencies are gearing up for a significant market shift anticipated in January. XYZVerse gears up for January’s market shift The spotlight is shifting to XYZVerse, a rising star in the crypto space poised for a significant breakout in January. XYZVerse is gearing up to redefine the market narrative with its unique blend of sports fandom, meme coin culture, and robust ecosystem development. XYZVerse is not just another meme coin; it’s a game-changer in the crypto ring. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, XYZ is capturing the imagination of sports fans and crypto enthusiasts alike. With a roadmap that includes entertainment-focused dApps and a commitment to community-driven growth, XYZVerse is set to thrive in the upcoming market shift. Currently in its eighth presale stage, XYZ is priced at $0.001333, offering early investors a chance to capitalize on the token’s trajectory. By the time the presale concludes at the fifteenth stage, XYZ will reach $0.1, representing a 7,402% increase from its initial price of $0.0001. The success of platforms like Polymarket, which saw $1 billion in trading volume during the US election, demonstrates the massive potential of combining prediction markets with crypto. XYZVerse takes this concept further, merging sports hype, meme culture, and blockchain technology to create a dynamic ecosystem ready for mass adoption. The upcoming January market shift could be the catalyst XYZVerse needs to surge ahead of competitors. With plans for CEX and DEX listings, airdropped rewards for community contributors, and rock-solid tokenomics, XYZVerse is preparing to dominate the next phase of the crypto market. While Solana and Ethereum remain steady, XYZVerse is building momentum. With its unique concept, strong community focus, and potential for growth, XYZVerse is one to watch as January unfolds. Interested investors can join the XYZ presale for its potential 9,900% knockout . Solana Solana has seen notable price movements recently. Over the past six months, it has risen by 34.50%. However, in the last month, the price has decreased by 20.60%, including a 3.97% drop in the past week. Currently, SOL is trading between $177.72 and $201.47. SOL is below both its 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages at $189.09 and $190.79 respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 33.48 and the Stochastic oscillator is at 16.54, suggesting the asset is nearing oversold conditions. The MACD level of -2.081 indicates bearish momentum may continue. The nearest support level for SOL is at $141.08. If the price falls below this, it could test the second support at $87.33. On the upside, breaking through the nearest resistance at $248.58 may propel the price toward the second resistance level of $302. You might also like: Wall street-approved altcoins to watch for a balanced 2025 portfolio Ethereum Over the past week, the Ethereum price dropped by 2.42%, bringing it within the current range of $3232.83 to $3542.12. The monthly change shows a decline of 6.61%, and over the past six months, ETH has decreased by 1.57%. Technical indicators suggest potential shifts in ETH’s price. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 26.14, indicating that the asset is oversold. The Stochastic value is 12.83, supporting this oversold status. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level stands at -33.83, which could signal a forthcoming change in momentum. Both the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are close, at $3355.12 and $3400.11 respectively, hinting at a consolidation phase. If ETH manages to surpass the nearest resistance level at $4504, it could aim for the second resistance at $5515, offering potential gains of over 15% and 40% from current levels. Conversely, if it falls below the nearest support at $2483.85, the next support level is at $1473.56. Kaspa Kaspa has been experiencing a noticeable decline in its price recently. Over the past week, the coin’s value has dropped by approximately 6.70%. Looking at the monthly performance, it has decreased by about 23.90%. In the last six months, Kaspa has seen a significant reduction of around 36.50% in its price. Currently, KAS is trading in the range of $0.10 to $0.13. If the KAS price dips below its nearest support level at $0.08, the next support is at $0.0342. On the upside, the immediate resistance level is at $0.18. Surpassing this could lead Kaspa toward the second resistance at $0.22, representing a potential increase of over 45% from its current lower range. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 30.8 and the Stochastic oscillator is approximately 10.6, both indicating that Kaspa may be entering oversold territory. The Simple Moving Averages for both 10 and 100 days are at $0.12, showing that the price is consolidating around this point. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is negative at -0.001554, hinting at bearish momentum. Based on these factors, Kaspa’s price could either continue to decline or potentially rebound if buying interest increases. Conclusion While SOL, ETH, and KAS are promising, XYZVerse’s sports meme coin aims for 20,000% growth by blending memes and sports.

38201445,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323177,1735333553,Crypto Community Reacts To New IRS DeFi Reporting Rules,"The crypto community has taken to social media to express its grievances after the U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) launched their updated DeFi tax reporting requirements on Friday. U.S. Treasury, IRS Announce DeFi Tax Requirements As part of the regulation , digital asset brokers will be required to report on the gross proceeds of DeFi crypto sales through a 1099 form. The updated filing seems to pertain to front-end service providers and will ultimately treat DeFi brokers the same as securities brokers and custodied crypto trading platforms. The latest DeFi guidelines are set to go into effect on January 1, 2027. “These regulations will help ensure that all taxpayers play by the same set of rules and have access to the information they need to file their taxes accurately,” said Aviva Aron-Dine, Performing the Duties of Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy. “Aligning tax reporting requirements for digital assets with reporting for other assets will make filing easier and cheaper for compliant taxpayers while also helping close the tax gap,” she added. The Crypto Community Pushes Back Following the federal government’s announcement, several key players in the digital asset space took to X to share their concerns over the IRS’ latest rulemaking. The following statement is attributed to @BlockchainAssn CEO @KMSmithDC following the IRS' finalization of the broker rule today: pic.twitter.com/JvlaSVaT2t — Blockchain Association (@BlockchainAssn) December 27, 2024 “Today’s broker rulemaking by the IRS and Treasury – days before the end of the year – is a disappointing, but expected, final attempt to send the American crypto industry offshore,” said Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith. “On behalf of the industry, we’re prepared to take aggressive action to fight back,” she added. “We also look forward to working with the new pro-crypto Congress and Administration to roll back this and other anti-innovation rules.” “Treasury/IRS just dropped their DeFi broker regs, which impose substantial centralized reporting requirements on DeFi (starting Jan 1, 2027), and hoover up user data to the govt,” said Paradigm’s vice president of government affairs, Alexander Grieve. “The new pro-crypto Congress can, and should, roll these back via the CRA process next year.” Following the regulatory update, it seems DeFi’s best hope for a tax reporting reversal will come when President-elect Donald Trump returns to the Oval Office next month. Trump has pledged to overhaul digital asset regulation in the U.S. Most recently, the New York-born businessman tapped crypto-friendly former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins to lead the federal agency. It remains to be seen what, if any, changes Trump will make related to crypto accounting requirements.

More than just a meme coin, Catzilla positions itself as a movement for transparency, transformation, and community-driven financial growth Catzilla’s mission is clear: to empower the community while taking a stand against the corrupt forces in the crypto world. This DeFi hero is rallying crypto enthusiasts, meme fans, and investors toward a more equitable financial system. Unlike fleeting meme projects, Catzilla is built with long-term value in mind. Its structured presale begins at $0.0002 and progresses to $0.0016 over 14 stages, offering early adopters a 88% discount. This gradual price increase incentivizes early participation while laying the groundwork for substantial growth, with the potential for a 700% ROI by the time of public launch. The CATZILLA token goes beyond the meme coin archetype by offering a robust set of utilities: Governance: Shape the future of Catzilla through community-driven decisions. Incentives: Earn rewards for active engagement and support. Staking: Stake CATZILLA tokens and earn passive income while contributing to the ecosystem’s stability.

The 1-week and 1-month price changes are -1.93% and -22.67% respectively. However, technical indicators suggest a potential rebound. The RSI is at 39.02, nearing oversold territory. The stochastic is low at 15.87, also indicating oversold conditions. If buying pressure increases, Solana could rise towards the nearest resistance level at $240, a potential gain of around 30% from current prices. Should momentum continue, SOL might reach the second resistance at $302. Conclusion While SOL and other coins show less short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero, aiming to bring financial freedom to all. With a 700% ROI potential during its presale and triple utility features, Catzilla invites enthusiasts to join the fight against crypto villains and unite for greater success.

In a statement, South Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs says the individuals – Park Heung-ryong, Yoon Jung-sik, Lee Il-jin, Kim Kyung-il, Kang Hyun-cheol, Kim Cheol-min, Lee Geum-hyung, Kim Ryu-sung, Hwang-cheol, Ahn Il-nam, Seung-cheol-beom, Lee Young-rim, and Park Dong-hyun – have been sanctioned helping fund North Korea’s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) program. The sanctioned individuals work as IT personnel overseas particularly in China, Russia, Southeast Asia and Africa where they allegedly disguise their identity to work for IT companies or engage in information theft and cyber attacks. The IT personnel are believed to be working under the 313 General Bureau, a subsidiary of the Ministry of Military and Industry that oversees North Korea’s weapons production, research and development. South Korea is also sanctioning the Chosun Geumjeong Economic Information Technology Exchange Company, which is said to be involved in dispatching North Korean IT personnel abroad to contribute military funds to the regime. Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis says North Korean hackers stole $1.34 billion in 2024. A report from the United Nations (UN) Panel of Experts also says cyber plundering covers about 40% of the cost of North Korea’s WMD development.

38198463,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667703,1735333242,FLOKI Poised To Follow Dogecoin In Memecoin ETP Ranks After DAO Nod,"FLOKI is poised to become the second memecoin to launch a regulated Exchange-Traded Product after Dogecoin, following a decisive Floki DAO vote that approved allocating tokens for ETP liquidity. The proposal won “overwhelming” support, with 332.7 billion token (99.9%) voting in favor, 328.9 million token abstaining, and none opposing—a result the team described as the first time a DAO proposal passed without any vote against it. “The proposal, which was the first time ever in which a Floki DAO proposal has been passed without a single opposing vote, will result in a portion of 16,310,285,772.6 FLOKI tokens currently residing in a ‘community buyback wallet’ being used to provision liquidity for the Floki ETP while the rest is burned,” the official announcement from the team via X emphasized. FLOKI Aims To Mirror Dogecoin Community members see this as a landmark event, as the Floki ETP is scheduled to debut in early Q1 2025 in collaboration with what the team calls “a respected Asset Manager and an ETP Issuer.” According to Floki representatives, it will be listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange, recognized as one of the largest stock exchanges in Europe, thus elevating FLOKI’s profile in traditional financial markets. Related Reading: FLOKI Faces Downside Risks: $0.000110 Support Level Under Scrutiny Currently, Dogecoin remains the only other memecoin with a live ETP, although that product is traded on Sweden’s Spotlight Stock Market; the team notes that listing on Switzerland’s exchange has the potential to draw broader attention from both institutional and retail investors seeking regulated access to crypto assets. “When it goes live, the Floki ETP will allow institutional investors, regulated entities and retail investors to get exposure to FLOKI in a regulated way. This is a big move that is almost unprecedented in this space, because Dogecoin is currently the only memecoin in the WORLD, with a live ETP –and Floki could become the next memecoin with an ETP besides Dogecoin,” the DAO proposal stated. While many details remain under wraps due to nondisclosure agreements, the team further revealed that any tokens allocated for liquidity will remain the property of Floki itself, meaning they can be withdrawn “if there is enough third-party liquidity in the ETP” later on. Related Reading: Floki Inu Warning: Analyst Says ‘Prepare For The Crash’ – Details This news comes on the heels of a recent meeting of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s Global Markets Advisory Committee, where the memecoin was used as a “case study of a utility token.” Observers have noted that any regulatory attention—particularly of this kind—can boost a token’s credibility in a market that remains sensitive to compliance signals. The DAO-centric approach continues to be a cornerstone of the token’s philosophy, with frequent community votes and proposals shaping the project’s direction. Members have consistently backed initiatives focused on increasing recognition of the memcoin, which the team says aims “to be the world’s most known and most used cryptocurrency.” Reaction from the wider crypto community has also been enthusiastic. Crypto analyst Shelby, who has a substantial following, remarked via X: “Huge milestone – FLOKI about to make history as 2nd memecoin ETP! Clear sign of institutional adoption while keeping decentralized roots. Not DOGE, not SHIB, but FLOKI leading the charge in bridging TradFi and DeFi.” At press time, FLOKI was trading at $0.0001798. Thus, the memecoin has reclaimed the 200-day EMA, a crucial line often referred to as a “bull line.” However, the memecoin is still trading below the major resistance area between $0.000205 and $0.000215 (shown in red on the chart). Reclaiming this zone could open the gates for a new run toward the yearly high of $0.000349 from June.

After several drafts and 44,000 comments, the IRS’s new 1099-DA form is here. Or it will be on Jan. 1, 2026, at least — but starting in 2025, brokers are going to have to keep track of some new information. You may remember that the term “brokers” — and how tax regulators would define them — caused quite a stir back in 2023. Earlier drafts of the 1099-DA form included a section to identify the “broker type,” but this has since been removed. In doing so, the IRS essentially punted this issue down the line: They know they will have to issue rules around DeFi actors eventually, but they need more time. Beginning in 2025, “custodial brokers” will have to report gross proceeds, and then in 2026, they will have to report cost basis for certain transactions. These actors are exchanges (think Coinbase) that act more or less like traditional equities brokers; they hold assets on behalf of clients and provide a trading platform. Decentralized exchanges and NFT marketplaces are not exempt, but they will probably have to rethink how they collect data in 2025 in order to meet the reporting requirements. For accountants working with crypto-holding clients, the 1099-DA form is going to be an adjustment, IRS officials said on a recent webinar . Taxpayers who received 1099-DA forms will have details of their transaction history for the past year, but the custodial broker may not automatically calculate and input the cost basis information. “When you get that 1099-DA, and it only has gross proceeds, hopefully you will know the next questions to ask your clients to be able to fill in that information,” Seth Wilks, executive director of digital asset strategy and development at the IRS, said. The hope is the new system will help educate taxpayers about what transactions are taxable and make compliance easier. Fingers crossed that it’s a smooth transition, but we do not envy you, CPAs.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XRP investors turn to Lightchain AI for its growth potential. Table of Contents XRP faces challenges Lightchain AI: A transformational ecosystem Why XRP investors are switching to Lightchain AI Lightchain AI to expand the blockchain horizon A new paradigm for crypto investors The crypto world is always on the move, with evolving technologies opening doors to fresh opportunities. Devoted holders of established tokens like XRP are exploring alternatives, and one name that’s gaining traction is Lightchain AI (LCAI). Aiming to combine the power of artificial intelligence and blockchain, Lightchain AI is quickly becoming a top choice for investors seeking long-term growth. XRP faces challenges XRP, a token synonymous with cross-border payments, has played a pivotal role in redefining global remittance systems. Its high transaction speed and low fees have kept it at the forefront of blockchain innovation for years. However, the challenges it faces today are beginning to weigh on investor sentiment. A singular focus: XRP’s primary utility in international payments leaves little room for diversification, limiting its appeal to new industries. Regulatory battles: Ripple’s ongoing litigation with the SEC has created an air of uncertainty, deterring both individual and institutional investors. Competitive pressure: Emerging blockchain platforms with enhanced features and wider use cases are pushing XRP into a tighter competitive corner. Despite these hurdles, XRP’s strong foundation remains valuable — but for holders looking to expand into new markets and capitalize on innovation, Lightchain AI offers a compelling alternative. Lightchain AI: A transformational ecosystem Lightchain AI seeks to transform blockchain technology through its features. At its core is the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), which will enable developers to seamlessly integrate AI-powered applications into blockchain ecosystems. Its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism will reward nodes for performing AI computations, directly advancing machine learning and predictive analytics. A transparent AI framework will ensure that all AI decisions are fully auditable, fostering trust among users and developers. Lightchain AI will also incorporate decentralized governance, combining community-driven decision-making with intelligent automation. Built for scalability and efficiency, the platform will handle high volumes of transactions and AI tasks seamlessly while prioritizing privacy and security, essential for sensitive sectors. Additionally, it will promote global collaboration by engaging a vibrant developer community to enhance its AI capabilities.

Early-stage growth opportunity With Lightchain AI priced at $0.003 during its presale , early investors see significant upside potential. A modest investment could multiply as the project gains adoption and expands its ecosystem. Technological edge Lightchain AI brings a transformative approach to blockchain with its AI integration, potentially providing solutions to global problems that XRP’s payment-focused model cannot address.

Here are examples of how Lightchain AI could reshape global markets. Healthcare revolution: By enabling privacy-preserving AI diagnostics and research collaboration, Lightchain AI could transform medicine without compromising data security. Global logistics optimization: Through AI-powered tracking and resource allocation, Lightchain AI can streamline supply chain management, cutting costs and reducing inefficiencies. AI development democratization: Developers can leverage Lightchain AI’s AIVM to train machine learning models securely, fostering innovation in artificial intelligence. This versatility ensures that Lightchain AI has relevance across diverse industries, further cementing its appeal to XRP holders looking to diversify. A new paradigm for crypto investors As the crypto market matures, projects offering innovation and utility are gaining traction. XRP, while strong in its niche, faces challenges that make diversification a prudent strategy for investors. Lightchain AI, with its transformative AI-blockchain integration and broad applications, is emerging as a beacon of opportunity. For XRP holders seeking future-focused investments, Lightchain AI represents a shift in strategy — from relying on established systems to embracing transformative technologies with multi-industry potential.

38198290,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=314371,1735332940,Investor Anthony Pompliano Says One Factor Will Be a Huge Tailwind for Bitcoin and Crypto in 2025,"The founder of investment firm Morgan Creek Capital is identifying what could serve as a huge catalyst for Bitcoin ( BTC ) and the overall crypto market in 2025. In a new interview with Fox Business, longtime crypto bull and influencer Anthony Pompliano says that digital assets are maturing and earning their place at the table in terms of being accepted by the traditional finance world. “I think the big story of 2025 is going to be that crypto has now grown up and is part of the traditional financial system. And there’s pros and cons to that. But now we have a seat at the table – you saw that in the political arena in terms of donations and influence. But you also now are going to see it in the financial arena and that is going to be a huge tailwind I think for Bitcoin and crypto in 2025.” According to Pompliano, Bitcoin will always be the king of crypto and any argument for altcoins is a technological one. “I think that Bitcoin is the king and will remain the king. Most of the capital flows from the traditional world are going into Bitcoin. There are going to be other assets that enter into the market, you obviously see the Ethereum (ETH) ETF get approved and you’ll probably see others get approved as well. But the argument for anything other than Bitcoin is a very different one – it’s a technology argument. It’s no different than trying to pick between Google, Amazon, and Facebook. The Bitcoin argument is much more akin to ‘Do I want to protect my purchasing power?'” The executive goes on to note that the top crypto asset by market cap will thrive whether the US can use it as a reserve asset or not. Last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced that the US is legally not allowed to hold BTC as a reverse asset and isn’t looking to change the law, causing the market to dip. Bitcoin is trading for $94,108 at time of writing, a 2.1% decrease on the day.

The decision concludes months of legal disputes between the U.S. and South Korea, both of which sought Kwon’s extradition in connection with the $60 billion collapse of the Terra-Luna blockchain. Why Montenegro Chose U.S. Over South Korea in the Do Kwon Extradition Case Once hailed as a revolutionary blockchain project, Terra imploded in 2022. The collapse cost billions of dollars and forced major firms such as Three Arrows Capital, BlockFi, and FTX into bankruptcy. Steady lads, deploying…to the U.S. Montenegro's Justice Minister has approved the extradition of Do Kwon to the U.S. The Terraform Labs founder will face charges over the $40B crypto collapse. pic.twitter.com/W3K82fXy09 — Satoshi Club (@esatoshiclub) December 27, 2024 Investigators worldwide began probing Kwon’s role in the catastrophic fallout, leaving investors reeling and undermining trust in the cryptocurrency sector. Following the Terra-Luna collapse, Kwon evaded authorities, even as Interpol issued a Red Notice against him. He initially fled to Serbia and later moved to Montenegro. In March 2023, Kwon and former Terraform Labs finance officer Han Chang-joon were arrested at Podgorica Airport while attempting to board a private flight to Dubai using fake Costa Rican travel documents. After their arrest, Kwon and Han spent four months in a Montenegrin jail while prosecutors from the U.S. and South Korea vied for extradition rights. Multiple reversals occurred in legal proceedings in Montenegro . Kwon’s legal team, led by Balkan attorney Goran Rodić, contests each decision. Earlier this week, Montenegro’s Constitutional Court rejected an appeal by Kwon’s lawyers , clearing the way for the Justice Ministry’s decision. The appeal had challenged a September ruling by the Supreme Court, which found that conditions for his extradition to both South Korea and the United States had been met. Justice Minister Bojan Bozovic made the final decision, announcing that the U.S. request would take precedence. “The majority of the criteria prescribed by law favor the extradition request from the competent authorities of the United States of America,” the Justice Ministry stated. The decision simultaneously rejected South Korea’s request for Kwon’s extradition. In February, Montenegro deported Kwon’s business partner, identified only as J.C.H., to South Korea. From Crypto Genius to Fugitive: The Rise and Fall of Do Kwon Earlier this year, Terraform Labs agreed to shut down and pay the SEC a record $4.47 billion fine . U.S. prosecutors are pursuing additional criminal charges with severe penalties possible. In South Korea, if convicted of violating financial laws, Kwon could face up to 40 years in prison. The country continues to press its case for extradition. Terraform Labs developed TerraUSD, a stablecoin pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar and Luna, its sister token. The tokens attracted massive investments and media attention. South Korean outlets even hailed Kwon as a “genius.” However, in May 2022, both collapsed in a financial “death spiral,” devastating investors and sparking criticism of Terraform Labs as a Ponzi scheme. After its collapse in January 2023, Terraform Labs filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection, which was followed by many legal challenges.

38198086,https://coinpedia.org/?p=399067,1735332535,PEPE Price Prediction for December 28: Rally Imminent?,"The post PEPE Price Prediction for December 28: Rally Imminent? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Amid ongoing market uncertainty, Pepe (PEPE), the world’s third-largest crypto meme coin, is gaining significant attention from whales and traders. As of today, December 28, 2024, the overall cryptocurrency market appears to be struggling, including major assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and PEPE. PEPE Whale Purchased 1.42 Trillion Meme Coin Despite these struggles, whales and traders have begun showing interest and confidence in the token, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass and the whale transactions tracker Lookonchain. Recently, Lookonchain posted on X (formerly Twitter) that a crypto whale, who had previously sold all of his PEPE holdings for a profit of $11.7 million, has repurchased a significant 1.42 trillion PEPE worth $24.5 million amid the market dip. https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1872667088076275916 However, this substantial meme coin accumulation has occurred over six days, signaling an ideal buy-the-dip opportunity. In addition to this whale acquisition, PEPE spot inflow/outflow data revealed that exchanges have witnessed a significant outflow of $40.86 million worth of PEPE. This suggests that long-term holders are withdrawing tokens from exchanges. Outflow is an on-chain metric that indicates long-term holders’ withdrawals from exchanges, often signaling potential upside momentum and increased buying pressure. PEPE Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, PEPE has been consolidating within a tight range between $0.0000167 and $0.0000195 over the past ten days. However, a breakout from this consolidation could propel the meme coin significantly. Source: Trading View PEPE Price Prediction Based on recent price action, if PEPE breaches this consolidation zone and closes a daily candle above the $0.000020 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 40% to reach the $0.0000278 mark in the future. PEPE’s bullish thesis will remain valid only if it closes a daily candle above the $0.000020 level; otherwise, it may fail to gain upward momentum. Current Price Momentum At press time, PEPE is trading near the $0.000018 mark and has experienced a price rally of over 4.5% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume declined by a modest 3.2%, indicating reduced participation from traders and investors amid a shift in market sentiment.",POSITIVE,PEPE,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | PEPE,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/pepe-price-prediction-for-december-28-rally-imminent/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

38197762,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634134,1735331760,Analysts project stock trades will shift beyond the “Magnificent 7”,"Investors are projecting the enthusiasm that has driven the “Magnificent 7” tech stocks to record highs this year to spread even further into other areas like software stocks. Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Meta, Google, Apple, and Nvidia have seen their prices reach record highs, thanks to the AI hype. Nvidia’s shares specifically boast an over 175% increase this year. More than the “Magnificent 7” will benefit in 2025 However, investors are certainly expecting the hype to expand to other stocks , for instance, areas like utilities and software stocks which will keep benefiting from Big Tech’s massive AI bet. David Kostin, a Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist forecasts the S&P 500 will reach 6,500 by the end of 2025 while the rest of the market’s gains are projected to come closer to those large-cap tech stocks. “It’s less about valuation but more about earnings growth that will dictate those returns,” said Kostin during a Goldman Sachs 2025 media roundtable with reporters. “The narrowing of the differential between the growth rates is likely to lead to a narrowing of [difference in] the performance.” Kostin. Kostin also projects the rapid earnings growth that was seen in large caps over the past 18 months will slow, while earnings are seen picking up for the other 439 stocks in the S&P 500. Another projection came from BofA’s equity strategy team led by Savita Subramanian. They issued a year-end target of 6,666 for the S&P 500 next year that includes a call for a broadening of earnings driven by AI. “AI is definitely playing a role in 2025 earnings,” Subramanian told Yahoo Finance. “And in fact, one of the reasons that we’re bullish on the broadening out of earnings is the idea that instead of everybody spending on tech capex, tech capex is actually picking up, and tech companies are sort of spending on a broader array of industries,” added Subramanian. Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta alone are anticipated to increase their capital expenditures by 42% in 2024 and another 17% in 2025 subsequently expanding their total spend to $244 billion in 2025. Utilities providers to cash in on AI However, according to Yahoo Finance, not all of this spending is on AI chips, as tech firms are also ramping up spending to pay for the power required to run AI data centers. Studies have shown that energy consumption at data centers is increasing in line with the increasing demand for AI services. This is pushing tech companies to look for alternative energy sources to power their data centers. During the roundtable with reporters, BlackRock’s Investment Institute revealed that the power required to operate one data center is about equal to the average amount of power used in a day by all of New York City. Because of this, strategists including BofA’s Subramanian are bullish about the companies exposed to this particular technology buildout. This includes the Utilities sector (XLU), which is already up by more than 20% in 2024, partially spurred by AI optimism . According to Goldman Sachs, the shift is already there. In his 2025 equity outlook, Kostin emphasized a basket of three potential AI trades, highlighting the shift from “Phase 1” stocks like Nvidia to “Phase 2” stocks like Goldman’s AI “infrastructure” bucket is already underway. AI infrastructure stocks, including semiconductor companies like Arm Holdings and utility power plays like Vistra Corp have already experienced significant rallies. Goldman believes the changing of the AI guard in the year ahead will further hold as the trades continue to shift to “phase 3” under a basket of stocks that the firm has labeled “enabled revenues.” “Enabled revenues” refers to a group of firms that will benefit from the rollout and monetization of AI solutions. These are companies that can use AI to drive sales but not actually sell merchandise like AI chips to other companies. Goldman is tracking these companies in this basket, and these include software and services stocks, for example, Adobe, Mastercard, and Salesforce.

Analysts Recommend BlockDAG, Dogecoin, BNB, XRP & Solana!","The crypto market has proven time and time again that investing in the right projects at the right time can lead to life-changing returns. As traders gear up for the next bull run, five cryptocurrencies stand out for their growth potential and strong foundations: BlockDAG (BDAG), Dogecoin (DOGE), Binance Coin (BNB), Ripple (XRP), and Solana (SOL). These cryptos are more than just popular names; they each bring unique value to the table. Whether it’s innovative scalability, meme-powered community loyalty, or enterprise-level applications, these projects cater to various investment goals. Diversification is the key, and this list of the top 5 cryptos to buy now for massive ROI highlights why these coins can potentially deliver the kind of returns traders dream about. 1. BlockDAG: Crypto’s Rising Star BlockDAG (BDAG) has secured its place in the top 5 cryptos to buy now for massive ROI due to its flourishing presale and consistent growth. Currently priced at $0.0234, BlockDAG has raised an impressive $172.5 million, with over 17.5 billion coins sold since its presale began. Early backers have already enjoyed a 2,240% ROI, and analysts suggest the coin could achieve a 20,000x ROI in the coming years. What sets BlockDAG apart is its scalability and efficiency, which built it for long-term success with its advanced Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology. Unlike many new projects, BlockDAG has consistently delivered on its promises, and its confirmed mainnet launch in 2025 is a testament to its credibility. Traders looking for high ROI potential and a project with a proven track record will find BlockDAG an enticing opportunity. Its crypto presale numbers and strong community engagement ensure it remains a top choice for those seeking substantial gains. 2. Dogecoin: The “People’s Coin” Dogecoin, famous as the “people’s coin”, continues to thrive as a top choice for casual and seasoned traders. Its loyal community and Elon Musk’s consistent backing have kept it relevant despite market fluctuations. Dogecoin’s low transaction fees and growing acceptance as a payment method, including by major retailers, add to its appeal. However, its heavy reliance on hype and celebrity endorsements can lead to unpredictable price swings, making it a riskier option for some investors. For those who value community-driven projects and don’t shy away from market volatility, Dogecoin remains a top crypto to buy for a huge ROI. 3. BNB: Utility Beyond the Exchange Binance Coin (BNB) has evolved from a simple utility token for discounted trading fees to a powerhouse in the crypto world. Backed by the Binance Exchange, the world’s largest cryptocurrency trading platform, BNB offers a diverse range of use cases, from transaction fees to DeFi applications. The coin’s quarterly buyback and burn mechanism reduces its circulating supply, potentially driving up its value over time. Despite its strong fundamentals, concerns around exchange-related risks, including regulatory scrutiny, may deter some cautious investors. Traders seeking a versatile token with proven utility and a history of resilience, BNB is among the top cryptos to buy now. 4. XRP: Cross-Border Efficiency Ripple’s XRP is a crypto tailored for cross-border payments, offering fast, low-cost transactions for businesses and individuals. Its partnerships with financial institutions and banks worldwide have displayed its role in the financial ecosystem. However, its ongoing legal battle with the SEC has created uncertainty, which could affect its growth trajectory. Despite this, XRP remains a strong choice for traders who value real-world applications and long-term utility. Its focus on financial inclusion and efficiency ensures it retains relevance in the crypto ecosystem. 5. Solana: High-Speed Blockchain Performance Solana has established itself as a leader in blockchain scalability, capable of processing 65,000 transactions per second at minimal fees. Its proof-of-history consensus mechanism enables efficient validation, making it ideal for high-frequency applications like DeFi and NFTs. Solana’s expanding developer ecosystem and strong community support have driven its adoption. However, its history of network outages raises questions about its reliability during high usage periods. But for traders seeking a blockchain built for speed and scalability, Solana is still an elite player. Its efficiency and growing number of applications across gaming, finance, and beyond make it a strong pick despite occasional challenges. Which is The Top Crypto To Buy Now? Each of these cryptocurrencies offers unique advantages. Dogecoin thrives on community engagement, while BNB provides unparalleled utility across Binance’s ecosystem. XRP delivers real-world financial applications and Solana excels in speed and scalability. BlockDAG, however, stands to give the most back with its impressive presale performance, advanced technology, and strong ROI potential. Traders looking for versatility and long-term growth will find it hard to overlook this rising star. Ultimately, the best choice depends on individual goals and risk tolerance. But BlockDAG continues to lead the pack in top cryptos to buy for a huge ROI, making it an excellent addition to any forward-thinking crypto portfolio.

38197785,https://blockworks.co/news/mstr-and-bitcoin-standard-etf-filing,1735331400,"MSTR check-in, ‘Bitcoin Standard’ ETF filing","This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Holiday celebrations transpired the last few days. But the week was also marked by MicroStrategy becoming part of the Nasdaq 100. While some thought this would offer the company’s stock price a short-term lift, that so far hasn’t been the case. As of 1 pm ET, MSTR’s share price was down 22% since the market opened on Dec. 16 (after the index inclusion news late the prior Friday). End-of-year profit-taking (MSTR is up ~380% in 2024) and recent declines in BTC price are likely contributors to MicroStrategy’s latest price dip. But the bigger picture? Significance of MSTR’s inclusion in the index, analysts note, stems from the massive funds that allocate to the Nasdaq 100 constituents — namely Invesco’s QQQ, an ETF that manages $325 billion in assets. “More to the point, it’s acceptance,” Dan Weiskopf, co-portfolio manager of Amplify’s BLOK ETF, told me last week. “It’s institutional adoption. It’s an example of [Michael Saylor’s] strategy working , candidly.” The question for 2025 is whether MSTR could also land itself in the S&P 500. Bigger than QQQ, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) — with $636 billion in assets — invests in the companies within that index. Weiskopf called this possibility within the next year “a reach,” but believes it’s inevitable. Benchmark’s Mark Palmer noted that while MicroStrategy easily meets the minimum market cap and trading volume, it needs positive earnings for the most recent quarter and combined positive earnings for its last four quarters. MSTR’s plan to adopt new FASB guidance on how BTC on balance sheets is accounted for would position it to begin reporting positive earnings as soon as Q1, Palmer added. People are clearly noticing the trend of more companies holding BTC as a treasury asset. Just ask asset manager Bitwise, which yesterday proposed a Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF. The planned offering would invest in companies with market caps above $100 million that hold at least 1,000 BTC in their corporate treasury. MSTR obviously fits that criteria (444,262 BTC). So too do a bunch of the bigger bitcoin miners , like Marathon Digital (44,394 BTC as of Dec. 18), Hut 8 (10,096 BTC), Riot Platforms (17,429 BTC) and CleanSpark (9,297 BTC). Elsewhere, Metaplanet revealed a buy of roughly 620 BTC on Monday, bringing its total holdings to about 1,762 BTC. Others — like KULR Technology Group, with an initial buy of 217 BTC yesterday — are working their way up. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

The DEX platform for perpetual futures has, in the past few days, attracted attention amid speculation that hackers affiliated with North Korea-backed Lazarus Group were snooping for vulnerability. Hyperliquid Labs has since debunked the claims of potential vulnerability as linked to whale activity, which is said to be from North Korean hackers. But away from this, what does Ryan Watkins, the co-founder of venture capital firm Syncracy Capital and former senior research analyst at market intelligence platform Messari, say about Hyperliquid ( HYPE )? On Dec. 27, the Syncracy Capital co-founder took to X to express his bullish outlook for the DEX platform. According to Watkins , Hyperliquid could grow into one of the biggest blockchain projects by fee generation in the coming year. “Hyperliquid has strong potential to become the top blockchain by fees generated in 2025 in large part because it vertically integrates almost all the most profitable business in crypto’s history: exchange (spot + derivatives) + blockspace (HyperEVM).” You might also like: Here’s why HYPE fell 20% over the past day Observers say HYPE token’s potential to explode in the coming months is down to the industry’s adoption of the spot and derivatives offering as well as traction for the HyperEVM. In Watkins view, the missing component that would see Hyperliquid “complete the holy trinity” and potentially dominate is a stablecoin. “Stablecoin is harder to do in practice, but wouldn’t be surprised if it’s attempted. Terra in the past and Berachain + Ethena (soon) today are doing the same thing”. Ethena Labs recently launched USDtb , a stablecoin backed by Blackrock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund. The initiative is in partnership with the tokenization platform Securitize. Per DeFiLlama data , Hyperliquid has recorded $5.16 million in seven-day fees and revenue. In comparison, Ethereum, Solana and Tron have generated more. The top protocols by fees across the ecosystem are on Ethereum, led by the stablecoin giant Tether. On Solana, DEX protocol Raydium, liquid staking platform Jito and meme launchpad Pump.fun lead in fees generation.

Don’t Let History Repeat – Dive into the Top Trending Meme Coin Presale!,"Cryptocurrency’s history is brimming with tales of those who dared early and reaped rewards. But just as many watched from the sidelines, missing their shot at life-changing wealth. Remember the buzz around Pepe Coin (PEPE)? Many hesitated, letting an opportunity slip through their fingers. Now, another moment beckons with BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a top trending meme coin presale poised to transform early believers into crypto legends. Let’s explore why you can’t afford to sit out this time and how BTFD Coin is your golden ticket to the next big meme coin explosion. BTFD Coin: Redefining Meme Coin Success Launched with a rallying cry to “ Buy The Dip ,” BTFD Coin is more than a meme; it’s a movement.

Confirm the transaction and secure your future. The clock’s ticking. Are you ready to ride the bull? Pepe Coin: A Case Study in Missed Opportunities PEPE took the meme coin world by storm in 2023, climbing from obscurity to become one of the year’s hottest tokens. Inspired by the beloved “Pepe the Frog” meme, this coin’s rise was meteoric. Early investors saw staggering returns, with some turning mere hundreds into hundreds of thousands. However, like many meme coins, PEPE’s success was fleeting. By the time mainstream attention caught on, the massive gains were already in the rearview mirror. The coin’s all-time high of $0.00000431 now serves as a sobering reminder: timing is everything. So, what caused many to miss out on PEPE’s initial success? Scepticism: Dismissed as a joke, few recognised its potential. Lack of Awareness: Early adopters often capitalise before a project gains traction. Fear of Volatility: PEPE’s sharp price movements scared off cautious investors. Despite its rollercoaster ride, PEPE proved the power of meme coins and community-driven hype. But for those who missed it, BTFD Coin presents a second chance. With a well-structured roadmap, staking incentives, and a vibrant community, BTFD is poised to surpass PEPE’s success. Why Buy the Dip Matters More Than Ever History has shown us that crises often disguise opportunities. Take the 1973 financial crash, for example. The collapse of the Bretton Woods system and the OPEC oil embargo led to soaring inflation and a 50% stock market dip. Yet, investors like Warren Buffett saw the downturn as a chance to scoop up undervalued assets, paving the way for immense profits during the recovery. This principle of “ buying the dip ” is at the heart of BTFD Coin. The crypto market’s volatility offers endless opportunities for those bold enough to act. By joining the BTFD presale, you’re not just buying a coin; you’re embracing a mindset that turns challenges into triumphs. Conclusion: Seize the Moment with BTFD Coin The crypto landscape rewards those who act decisively. While PEPE Coin showcased the potential of meme coins, BTFD Coin is here to redefine it. With its top trending meme coin presale , staking rewards, and vibrant community, BTFD offers more than just a chance to invest; it’s an invitation to lead the next big crypto charge. Don’t let this opportunity slip through your fingers like PEPE. Sign up for the BTFD Coin presale today, apply the BIG50 code, and secure your place in the bull market’s future. This is your moment to ride the dip to new heights. The bulls are ready; are you?

38197263,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634120,1735330595,IRS targets DeFi brokers with new tax reporting rules set for 2027,"The IRS is going after decentralized finance (DeFi) brokers with a vendetta. If left, starting in 2027, these brokers will be required to report every dime made in crypto sales. The new rules fall under section 6045 of the Internal Revenue Code and are part of this big push to extend traditional tax regulations to the crypto industry. So brokers, as defined under these updated laws, will have to submit detailed reports on customer transactions. A crackdown on non-custodial players These rules don’t just target centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Oh no, the IRS has its sights set on DeFi’s golden promise: decentralization. Smart contracts, automated platforms, and even non-custodial wallets (tools that let users stay in control of their private keys) aren’t safe anymore. The IRS has made up a new phrase, “digital asset middlemen,” to call non-custodial operators who play a role in crypto transactions. So basically, if you’re helping someone sell or exchange digital assets — even if you never touch their funds — you’re now considered a broker. This includes hosted wallet providers, decentralized payment processors, and even operators of digital asset kiosks. Whatever that even is. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 kicked this off, editing section 6045 to expand the definition of “broker.” It also introduced reporting requirements for cryptos, putting them on par with traditional securities. While these changes officially took effect in January, the final rules for DeFi participants were delayed until now. Gross proceeds reporting: What it means for DeFi Also, under these regulations, brokers will have to report “gross proceeds” from crypto sales. This includes the total amount received by a seller, regardless of expenses like transaction fees. For DeFi platforms that operate through smart contracts, this means creating systems to track and report every transaction. Because y es, even in a trustless ecosystem, someone will have to do the IRS’s bidding. To enforce these rules, the IRS will use the same authority it applies to traditional brokers. Section 7805 of the tax code gives the Treasury Department the power to create regulations necessary for enforcing tax laws. And according to the IRS, tax compliance increases significantly when brokers are required to file information returns. Public pushback and industry concerns Of course, no one is happy about these changes. When the proposed rules were published in August, they brought in a flood of feedback. Over 44,000 comments poured in from industry leaders, crypto enthusiasts, and even average users worried about privacy and operational challenges. One of the biggest issues was the IRS’s definition of a broker. Many believe that applying these rules to non-custodial platforms is both impractical and overreaching. How can a smart contract report user data when it doesn’t even know who the user is? And what happens to the fundamental principles of DeFi—privacy, autonomy, and decentralization—if platforms are forced to comply with these regulations? Despite the pushback though, the IRS still pushed forward. A public hearing happened in November 2023, followed by months of review.

38197699,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53271,1735330505,"Top New Meme Coins to Join for Long-Term Gains: BTFD Coin’s Juicy 50% Offer, Bonk’s 1.8% Supply Burn, and Turbo’s 7% 24-Hour Fall","If you’re on the lookout for the top new meme coins to join for long-term gains, you’re in the right place. Meme coins are taking the crypto world by storm, and a few projects are making waves right now. It’s an exciting time for investors looking to capitalise on meme coin trends with huge potential for long-term rewards. Whether you’re into staking rewards, gaming features, or supply burn strategies, there’s something here for you to sink your teeth into. In particular, BTFD Coin is one to watch. Its presale has been absolutely on fire, with over $4.6 million raised so far. The 13th presale stage is currently live, and more than 60 billion $BTFD tokens have already been sold. With over 6,900 coin holders joining the Bull Squad, it’s clear that BTFD Coin is rapidly gaining momentum . What makes this even sweeter? The festive 50% bonus available when you use the code BIG50 . This promotion draws inspiration from the 1973 oil market crash, reminding us that market downturns can be the perfect time to seize opportunities. Don’t miss out on this exclusive deal that’s bound to make your investment grow faster than a meme coin meme goes viral. BTFD Coin: Ready for Liftoff With its innovative play-to-earn (P2E) game , robust staking rewards, and a community that’s more like a family (hello, Bulls Squad!), BTFD Coin has all the makings of a meme coin destined for success. And the cherry on top? The 50% festive bonus, which means that you get 50% more $BTFD tokens when you use the code BIG50 . That’s a seriously juicy offer that could give your investment a major boost. But it’s not just about the bonus—it’s about capitalising on the buy-the-dip mentality. Looking back at the 1973 oil market crash, this strategy celebrates finding value in market downturns, making it the perfect mindset for long-term gains. By investing $5,000 at today’s price of $0.000142 per coin and using the BIG50 code to get 50% more tokens, you would end up with 52,816,900.5 $BTFD tokens. If the price increases to $0.0006 per token, your investment could grow to $31,690.14, resulting in a $26,690.14 profit. That’s a pretty solid return! Bonk: A Burn That Could Boost Your Gains Next up on our list of top new meme coins to join for long-term gains is Bonk. The Solana-based meme coin has recently made headlines with a massive burn of 1.69 trillion Bonk tokens, worth about $54.5 million. This reduction of 1.8% in total supply could lead to a supply shortage, potentially increasing the value of Bonk over time. The Bonk DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation) approved this decision, meaning that the community is actively shaping the future of the coin. Bonk is looking to deliver long-term value, and with this major burn, it could gain the kind of attention that leads to price surges in the future. If you’re into meme coins with a serious long-term strategy and a dedicated community, Bonk is a coin to consider. Turbo: A Coin with Momentum (But Watch the Dip) Turbo, another meme coin making waves, has had a bit of a rough 24 hours with a 7% fall in price. But this kind of market fluctuation is common in the meme coin world. Despite the drop, Turbo has a market cap of over $650 million and an impressive trading volume. Its strong community and ongoing development make it one of the top new meme coins to join for long-term gains, especially if you’re someone who loves a bit of risk. If you’re eyeing Turbo, keep an eye on its movements—after all, meme coins often rise in value as quickly as they fall. With its potential to rebound, Turbo could be one to watch in the coming weeks, making it a worthy contender for a diversified meme coin portfolio.

38196874,https://crypto.news/?p=14322782,1735330302,Meme Index raises $500 in presale for its unique platform,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Meme Index raises $500k in presale for its decentralized meme coin index trading platform. Table of Contents Meme Index: Offsetting the risk of concentrated investments The four meme coin baskets available on Meme Index Meme Index (MEMEX) , the first decentralized meme coin indices investing platform, has raised over $500k in its presale. The creators aim to simplify investing in meme coins while providing single-click diversification. Meme Index: Offsetting the risk of concentrated investments The meme coin sector reached a peak market capitalization of $137 billion in 2024, with thousands of meme coins on the market. Meme Index aims to simplify the experience of investing in meme coins by allowing market participants to buy diversified baskets of tokens grouped by volatility. Four baskets will be available, ranging from low to ultra-high volatility. Those with a bigger risk appetite would prefer ultra-high volatility, while more conservative investors would opt for the low-volatility basket. Grouping meme coins into indexes aims to offset the downside risk of concentrated investments in a singular asset. The four meme coin baskets available on Meme Index Meme Index will offer four indexes: the Titan Index, Moonshot Index, Midcap Index, and Meme Frenzy Index. As mentioned, volatility correlates to risk level. The Titan Index will include lower-volatility, higher-market-cap meme coins. It will consist of the top ten meme coins with a market cap over $1 billion (Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, etc.). The Moonshot Index will move further along the risk curve, comprising meme coins listed on (or soon to be listed on) centralized exchanges but with a market cap below $1 billion. Users seeking more volatility may opt for the Midcap Index, which will contain meme coins with a market cap between $50 million and $250 million. This basket has more room for growth but is more likely to experience significant crashes than the aforementioned two. And for maximum risk and maximum reward potential, Meme Frenzy Index will provide exposure to micro-to-low-cap meme coins. This approach of volatility-grouped meme baskets allows investors to choose their risk level and find the right fit for their portfolio. The MEMEX token will be required to access the platform and will also grant holders governance rights. Holders will be able to vote to adjust the assets in each basket to better suit evolving market conditions. MEMEX is currently undergoing a presale . Once it’s complete, the token will be listed on exchanges, and the team will begin initiating the governance organization and the Meme Index. The team also plans to expand platform utility based on governance proposals. These plans have drawn interest from industry analysts, such as Michael Wrubel, who provided positive coverage in a recent video on his YouTube channel. To learn more, visit the Meme Index website .

38196766,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376402,1735330130,"Bitwise Proposes New ETF to Invest in Firms Holding 1,000 BTC or More","The prominent crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer has proposed a new product called the Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF, which aims to invest in publicly traded companies that adhere to a “Bitcoin standard,” holding at least 1,000 BTC in their corporate treasuries. The ETF will focus on firms with a market capitalization of at least $100 million, daily trading liquidity of $1 million or more, and less than 10% of their stock privately held. Bitwise plans to update its index quarterly, using public corporate reports to adjust the fund’s holdings. Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF According to the official filing , as opposed to traditional ETFs, which base stock weight on company market caps, Bitwise’s new fund will assign weight based on the market value of each company’s Bitcoin holdings, with a maximum weight of 25% per constituent to ensure balanced exposure. This initiative comes amid increasing interest in Bitcoin investment products, fueled by rising BTC prices – up 126% over the past year. Data reveals that at least 30 companies across the world currently meet these criteria. This includes prominent Bitcoin holders such as MicroStrategy, with over 444,000 BTC, and mining companies like Marathon Digital, Riot, Tesla, and Hut 8. These firms are primarily based in the US, Canada, and Asia, with Japan, Hong Kong, and Thailand also emerging as key players in Bitcoin adoption. The proposal comes amidst growing corporate adoption of Bitcoin as many companies seek to boost stock value by integrating Bitcoin into their treasuries. On that note, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley commented, “It feels like 2025 will be a big year for new corporates adopting the Bitcoin Standard.” Corporates Embracing Bitcoin The latest one to dip its toes is KULR Technology Group, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and has bought 217.18 Bitcoin for approximately $21 million, beginning its Bitcoin treasury with an average purchase price of $96,556.53 per BTC. This acquisition is the first step in a larger strategy to invest up to 90% of its surplus cash into Bitcoin through future purchases. Earlier this week, Matador Technologies approved a strategic move to diversify its corporate treasury by adding Bitcoin and USD-denominated assets in a bid to reduce risks associated with the Canadian dollar’s potential devaluation. The company plans to invest $4.5 million in Bitcoin by December 2024 and may continue acquisitions through measured programs.

Bitcoin’s trading price in South Korea is 3% higher than the global spot price. The “kimchi premium” refers to the price gap between Bitcoin (BTC) listed in South Korea and those in U.S. or European exchanges. Bitcoin Kimchi Premium Spikes As Korean Won Plunge According to crypto data provider Cryptoquant, the Korea Premium Index has increased by 3%. This means South Koreans are paying 3% more to buy Bitcoin than their U.S. counterparts as they seek protection from the plummeting won. The won has slumped to a 15-year low against the dollar. Currently, Bitcoin is valued at 145,000,000 won, or about $98,600, on Upbit, South Korea’s largest crypto exchange. In contrast, the leading cryptocurrency is valued at about $96,700 on Coinbase, the US’s leading exchange. It is important to note that Bitcoin prices in South Korea are driven mainly by retail investors since institutional and foreign investors cannot participate freely. Political Tensions Rise in South Korea Meanwhile, the 3% spike in the Bitcoin Kimchi Premium follows escalating political tensions in South Korea. The South Korean parliament recently voted to impeach Prime Minister Han Duck-soo and the acting President, only a few weeks after impeaching President Yoon Suk Yeol. This unfolding drama revolves around election fraud and the erosion of trust in South Korea’s National Election Commission (NEC). A cybersecurity audit conducted last year, led by the National Intelligence Service (NIS), revealed alarming vulnerabilities in the NEC’s systems. “Every constitutional scholar needs to pay attention to what happens in Korea over the next few weeks,” says Bitwise’s Jeff Park in an X post . He added that the use of impeachment as a political tool and accusations of foreign election meddling highlight the vulnerability of democracy to misinformation. South Korea’s Crypto Boom Despite the rising political situation, crypto continues to expand in South Korea. According to earlier reports, over 30% of its population is now engaged in crypto investments . Between July and November 2024, the total market capitalization rose from 58 trillion won to 102.6 trillion won. South Korean investors now hold an average of 6.58 million won in crypto, reflecting a growing trust in the asset class.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB.

Cardano price analysis shows historic price movements, while Shiba Inu’s increased whale activity suggests a potential 250% surge could be in the works. Meanwhile, BlockDAG, a rising layer-1 cryptocurrency, is reportedly gearing up for a major Hollywood-like reveal for its Keynote 3. BlockDAG has already gathered over $172.5 million in its presale, pushing towards a $600 million goal. If these trends continue, all three coins might see significant transformations in 2025. Let’s delve into these exciting developments to see which might emerge as one of the top crypto coins in 2025. Cardano Price Analysis: Could It Surge to $6? Cardano (ADA) is drawing attention with its historical pricing trends and vital support levels. Recent Cardano price analysis suggests a potential surge to $6. Crypto analysts see parallels between ADA’s current downturn and a pivotal moment from 2020, as ADA fights to maintain above the crucial $0.76 support mark. With ADA currently priced at $0.88, facing pressure from recent sell-offs, it could rebound and target $1. The upcoming Plomin hard fork in January 2025 aims to boost Cardano’s governance, while ongoing enhancements suggest growth. The bullish patterns from Cardano price analysis and other upcoming developments make ADA a key project to watch. Shiba Inu Whale Activity Peaks—250% Rally on the Horizon? Shiba Inu is accustomed to the market’s ups and downs. The latest Shiba Inu whale activity indicates that a 250% price rally may be near. Despite a 7% drop in price, Shiba Inu’s 1,068% increase in its burn rate and developments in the Shibarium network bolster its position. A staggering 51.7 million SHIB tokens were incinerated within a day. The ongoing reduction in supply, which now exceeds 410 trillion SHIB, while recent Shiba Inu whale activity and price declines have prompted skepticism, experts maintain a positive outlook on Shiba Inu’s future as the Shibarium continues to fortify the coin. BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 Set for Hollywood Glamour! BlockDAG, a promising layer-1 blockchain, is prepping for its third major keynote. This time, it’s not just any presentation; whispers suggest a grand Hollywood production is in the works, crafted by top-tier movie industry professionals. The previous BlockDAG keynotes captured worldwide interest and were a hit. Yet, the upcoming Keynote 3, scheduled for 2025, is poised to transform how crypto stories are told, setting a benchmark that melds creativity with technology. This buzz has supercharged BlockDAG’s impressive presale achievements, with funds soaring beyond $172.2 million and sales of over 17.5 billion coins. As it edges closer to a colossal $600 million goal, the current price stands at $0.0234 per coin in batch 26, offering an ROI of 2240%. With projections pointing to even higher returns and the next batch expected to fetch a higher price, enthusiasts are scrambling to get BDAG while it’s still within reach. BlockDAG focuses on top-notch security, environmental sustainability, and boasts a structure that offers unmatched scalability and speed. These features are ensuring its spot as one of the top crypto coins in 2025. Plus, the rumored Hollywood collaboration for Keynote 3 showcases BlockDAG’s dynamic approach to community engagement. The excitement surrounding Keynote 3 and the journey to hit the $600 million mark highlights why now is a strategic time to acquire one of the top crypto coins in 2025. Wrapping Up the Crypto Predictions The crypto market is vibrant and evolving. Cardano, Shiba Inu, and BlockDAG are making distinct marks in the market. While Cardano (ADA) price analysis signals an upcoming breakout, the surge in Shiba Inu whale activity and enhancements within its network point to a promising uplift for this meme coin. Reaching the $600 million presale goal isn’t just a milestone for BlockDAG; it signifies the burgeoning appeal of the blockchain. If the collaboration with Hollywood filmmakers materializes, BlockDAG is set to become a fan favorite. As the project accelerates, an early buying could be a pivotal move for any crypto portfolio looking ahead to 2025. The prospects for this top crypto coin in 2025 are looking exceptionally bright.

This occurred subsequent to the crypto project’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)’s resounding approval of the allocation of liquidity for the establishment of a Floki ETP, with 99.9% of the vote cast in favor. The proposal was passed on December 27 with 332.7 billion votes in favor. Notably, there were no opposing votes. The crypto coin’s ETP is scheduled to go live on the SIX Swiss Exchange in the first quarter of 2025. SIX is Switzerland’s largest stock market and the third-largest in Europe. FLOKI DAO VOTES IN FAVOR OF A PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY FOR THE CREATION OF A FLOKI ETP! The Floki DAO has voted overwhelmingly in favor of a proposal to allocate tokens towards providing liquidity for the creation of a Floki ETP. The proposal, which was the first time ever… pic.twitter.com/e64vx3QOOl — FLOKI (@RealFlokiInu) December 27, 2024 A core advisor at Floki said, “With the Floki DAO voting overwhelmingly in favor of the proposal to provide liquidity for the Floki ETP, Floki is on track to become the only memecoin besides Dogecoin with an ETP on a regulated stock exchange as early as January 2025.” Introducing the Floki initiative The proposal, which was submitted on December 25, sought approval to use a portion of the 16.3 billion of its tokens from the community redemption wallet. This is to provide liquidity for the ETP. At present prices, the tokens are valued at approximately $2.8 million. A portion of the tokens will be used to support the ETP. However, the remaining balance will be destroyed in order to decrease the supply. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) recently recognized Floki as a utility token. This was during the Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC) meeting on Nov. 21. Reports say that this is what led to the launch of the crypto project’s ETP. Also, the crypto project’s forthcoming NFT-based metaverse game, Valhalla, which is anticipated to be released in early 2025, was a significant factor in the CFTC’s decision. FLOKI will serve as the principal in-game currency in Valhalla. 2025 is looking up for Floki . Javon Marks, a crypto analyst, expressed optimism regarding the crypto coin. He asserted that the memecoin has verified bull signals just below the critical $0.0002761498 target level. The analyst noted that this development could potentially lead to a rally of over 50% for the crypto. This could potentially pave the way for another rally to $0.0005467298. However, according to on-chain data, the crypto coin is the seventh-largest memecoin by market valuation. Its current value stands at $1.73 billion. At the time of publication, the coin was trading at $0.00017, a 400% increase from the beginning of 2024, despite recent downward trends. What is anticipated from ETP set in Switzerland? The ETP is expected to bring more stability to the asset and, in return, build more confidence in investors. In addition, the product is expected to be available to European investors at the beginning of the new year. There will be exposure to Floki without the complexities associated with direct ownership. B said, “ When it goes live, the Floki ETP will allow institutional investors, regulated entities, and retail investors to get exposure to FLOKI in a regulated way.” In addition, the ETP will also grant investors smoother access to the popular meme coin, exposing them to its market performance without the risk or intricacies of direct crypto ownership. Other than Trump’s new administration push with the introduction of the coins’ ETP, which could serve as another significant bullish catalyst, the crypto coin’s price could see a massive rally.

38196314,https://crypto.news/?p=14322773,1735329164,DeFi proponents to fight US IRS tax code,"The U.S. Internal Revenue Service said DeFi brokers should comply with long-standing securities rules, disagreeing with industry sentiment arguing for different laws for digital assets. Updated rules from the IRS published on Dec. 27 would direct some “DeFi brokers” to operate like traditional finance institutions by collecting certain user activity data and reporting on cryptocurrency proceeds. The finalized rules apply to “front-end” DeFi operators, referring to service providers that directly manage websites used to access web3 platforms like decentralized exchanges for both U.S. and non-U.S. participants. So-called DeFi brokers would also have to report on all digital assets, including NFTs and stablecoins . Aviva Aron-Dine, acting assistant secretary for tax policy, said the revised framework would level the taxpayer playing field and standardize reporting requirements for all participants. Crypto industry incumbents have debated against digital assets falling under the purview of existing securities laws, emphasizing that the industry requires different rules. The IRS, in a joint statement with the Treasury Department, completely disagreed with this assertion. The Treasury Department and the IRS do not agree that DeFi participants should be excluded from the information reporting rules under section 6045 because of a lack of financial services experience or because of a purported lack of comprehensive regulatory oversight. Persons with technology expertise that operate trades or businesses relating to financial services should comply with the same rules as any other person operating financial services businesses.

The IRS released proposed DeFi/crypto tax reporting policies in August 2023, with revised documents to include exchanges in its compliance guideline unveiled shortly after. Crypto commentators opined that DEXes like Uniswap might be forced to share KYC information, such as names and addresses, with authorities. Industry leaders fought against the agency’s initial tax proposal last year, and Consensys senior Attorney Bill Hughes predicts the same will happen again. “The outgoing administration is not leaving quietly. The fight continues,” Hugh said via X. A major concern espoused by crypto users argued that most DeFi protocols can’t comply with securities laws, and privacy would be almost nonexistent under the new laws. Digital asset advocacy groups like The Blockchain Association promised “aggressive action” against the IRS policies, suggesting Congressional lobbying and perhaps litigation might ensue. Without pushback, the latest rules would be enacted by Jan. 1, 2027. https://twitter.com/BillHughesDC/status/1872658747979596093 Read more: Crypto taxes: What does regulation look like around the world?",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | UNI,,0,0,crypto.news,https://crypto.news/defi-proponents-to-fight-us-irs-tax-code/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/38196314.jpeg

This has resulted in renewed interest in the Moo Deng coin, which is up by nearly 12% over the past week. Some smart money investors view it as one of the best meme coins to buy now. Other low-cap meme coins are also in significant demand, owing to their high upside potential. For instance, prominent investors are viewing Meme Index (MEMEX) as the next 10x meme coin. Moo Deng Coin - The Best Crypto To Buy Now? Vitalik Buterin revealed that was impressed by the “wonderful” Thai hospitality during the recently concluded Ethereum’s annual developer conference. In exchange, he accepted an invitation to become Moo Deng’s “adoptive father”, donating 10 million Thai Baht, worth nearly $300k, as part of the zoo’s Wildlife Sponsorship Program. Thank you Vitalik Buterin @VitalikButerin for joining the Wildlife Sponsorship Program and adopting Moo Deng with a generous gift of 10,000,000 THB for her family!

While this isn’t exactly an endorsement of the Moo Deng coin, the bulls are touting this as a victory. As such, the token price is up by nearly 12% over the past week. As such, MOODENG has strong fundamentals. For starters, it is an extremely popular meme coin, considering it is inspired by the cute pygmy hippo that went viral online earlier this year. The hippo was even featured on the popular late-night show, Saturday Night Live. Moreover, it has secured the backing of prominent Tier-1 CEXs, including a Coinbase spot listing earlier this month as well as a Binance Futures listing. Rumours are rife that a Binance spot listing is imminent. Unsurprisingly, experts are viewing Moo Deng as one of the best crypto to buy now, particularly when it re-tests its 0.786 Fibonacci level. #MOODENG I think this is pretty reasonable trade here.Buy at 0.786 level - > sell at new ATH. https://t.co/5N4JlWs8An pic.twitter.com/JoWawuRcqW — G O N Z O (@GonzoXBT) December 26, 2024 A growing number of smart money investors appear confident that the meme coin will reach $1 in the upcoming meme coin supercycle. Could Meme Index Offer 10x Returns? Low-cap meme tokens have also caught the attention of savvy investors as they hunt for 100x returns in the coming meme coin mania. For instance, Meme Index (MEMEX) is creating quite a buzz in its presale and has raised nearly $700k in its ICO. As the name suggests, Meme Index will soon launch the first-ever decentralized meme coin index funds, offering a broader market exposure along with a protective layer of community governance. MEMEX holders will have their pick — they can select any of the 4 meme coin baskets, considering each’s risk-reward ratio and their own risk appetite. There is the Meme Titan Index featuring large-caps, the Meme Moonshot Index comprising tokens with just under $1 billion valuation, the Meme Midcap Index and the Meme Frenzy Index, featuring low-caps that have strong community support. Notably, MEMEX holders will vote on which meme coins will be included in the aforementioned baskets. This will allow them to benefit from projects that they may have otherwise missed out on, thanks to the power of community intelligence. Already, early MEMEX buyers are earning a reward rate of over 3000% from the Meme Index’s presale staking pool. Prominent investors are bullish on MEMEX’s upside potential, with many calling it the next 10x meme coin.

38196031,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=314264,1735328748,Release Date for Incarcerated Former FTX Exec Ryan Salame Moved Up by a Year,"Incarcerated former FTX executive Ryan Salame appears to have already slashed a year off his prison sentence. Data from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons indicates Salame’s release date is now March 1st, 2031. The former co-chief executive of FTX Digital Markets reported to prison in October after being sentenced to 7.5 years behind bars, meaning he was initially scheduled for release around April 2032. Salame pled guilty last year to conspiracy to make unlawful political contributions and defraud the Federal Election Commission (FEC), as well as conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business. In May, District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan sentenced the former executive to 7.5 years behind bars, but a legal dust-up over the indictment of the mother of his child, Michelle Bond, delayed the start of his prison term. FTX imploded and filed for bankruptcy in November 2022 amid accusations that founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried mishandled the exchange’s funds by loaning out billions of dollars worth of customer deposits to Alameda Research, the firm’s trading arm, to make risky crypto bets that went awry. The exchange’s multi-billion dollar collapse led to a sharp downtick in crypto prices, and US federal authorities arrested Bankman-Fried the following month. In March, Judge Kaplan sentenced Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison and three years of supervised release. He also ordered the 32-year-old to pay $11 billion in forfeiture. Bankman-Fried is appealing his conviction and sentence.

According to a new report by France 24, Kwon – the person suspected of being behind the multibillion-dollar downfall of the Terra ecosystem in 2022 – had his appeal thrown out by the Montenegrin Constitutional Court, which earlier in the year ruled that the conditions for his extradition have been met. However, Justice Minister Bojan Bozovic still had to decide whether to extradite Kwon to the US or South Korea, both of which have pending charges against him. As stated by the Montenegrin Ministry of Justice, according to the report, “It was concluded that the majority of the criteria prescribed by law favor the extradition request from the competent authorities of the United States of America. Consequently, the Minister of Justice issued a decision approving the extradition of Kwon Do Hyung to the United States, while simultaneously rejecting the extradition request from the Republic of Korea,” Kwon, a South Korean native, was originally arrested in Montenegro in March 2023 after he was caught attempting to board a flight to Dubai with a fake Costa Rican passport. Kwon is accused of masterminding a Ponzi scheme involving the stablecoin TerraUSD that led to over $40 billion worth of investor’s money being wiped out. The dollar-pegged crypto asset – which at the time was following an automated, algorithmic system to keep its price steady – eventually collapsed after its stabilization mechanism backfired.

BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF saw a record $188.7M outflow and concerns about price manipulation. However, the institutional players in Bitcoin strengthen the overall market outlook. Kiyosaki predicts Bitcoin’s rise while criticizing BlackRock The popular Rich Dad Poor Dad author predicted that Bitcoin might reach $350,000 by 2025. He said this at the same time that the BlackRock issue continues, with fervent discussions over how big companies are entering crypto and the potential chance of influencing the price of Bitcoin. IBIT, which is BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, recorded an all-time outflow of $188.7 million on December 25. It was one of the largest sell-offs of its kind for Bitcoin, and the timing has made many wonder the investors’ sentiment behind such an outflow Kiyosaki said, “I am not the type to trust Bitcoin at BlackRock’s hands with this ETF.” In his opinion, price manipulation is beneficial to institutional players and has a warning for retail investors. “I love Bitcoin in my wallet,” Kiyosaki declared, reinforcing his preference for self-custody versus over-reliance on institutional-controlled financial products. The author also responded to some criticism from Vivek Ramaswamy; he has not been silent on the issues of corporate governance brought about by BlackRock, particularly about ESG criteria. He even criticized Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, for promoting “shareholder capitalism,” which he called Marxism. Ramaswamy compared Fink’s actions to Klaus Schwab’s statement, who said, “Someday you’ll own nothing and be happy,” Ramaswamy has criticized BlackRock several times for putting social and political issues before shareholder value. This led him to call for changes in corporate governance practices. Kiyosaki still believes in Bitcoin’s future, though the debate over BlackRock’s ETF continues and what that might do to the price of Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s growth boosted by big companies despite worries about manipulation Such optimism is based on Bitcoin’s continued strong growth, which has seen it rise approximately 130% this year and set record highs on several occasions. Much of the Bitcoin price increase this year was due to the interest presented by large companies. Major financial companies and corporations are buying Bitcoin as part of their reserve. For example, MicroStrategy started purchasing Bitcoin in 2020 and encouraged others to do the same. Just last week, KULR Technology purchased 217.18 BTC for $21 million. In the last few months, Bitwise Asset Management ETFs filed to create another ETF that will track shares of companies holding at least 1,000 BTC in their treasury. The entry of big players such as BlackRock and other companies trading Bitcoin has made FOMO for Wall Street investors. However, some in the Bitcoin community feel uneasy about how BlackRock and other large companies will attempt to control the asset for their gain due to the sheer amounts of money and influence they wield. Kiyosaki criticized BlackRock for playing a major role in manipulating Bitcoin’s price The only confusion the market sees in BlackRock is when it warns that “there’s no guarantee” that Bitcoin’s limit of 21 million won’t be changed. As controversy swirls around the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, criticism from people like Vivek Ramaswamy and Robert Kiyosaki’s prediction that Bitcoin will reach $350,000 by 2025 makes a pretty strong statement that shows confidence in the cryptocurrency. The positive prospects of Bitcoin will continue, no matter what regulatory issues and market manipulation worries it faces. Kiyosaki believes in Bitcoin mostly for the long run, and he advises investors to keep the assets themselves and not rely on companies such as BlackRock.

Based on this data, crypto analyst Kaduna predicted that the second-largest crypto by market cap could usher in the altcoin season at the start of the new year. Historical Performance Shows What To Expect From Ethereum Price CryptoRank data shows that the Ethereum price could enjoy positive monthly gains throughout the first quarter of 2025. This is based on historical trends that show that Ethereum enjoyed green monthly closes in Q1 of the 2017 and 2021 bull runs, the following years after the Bitcoin Halving. 2025 is expected to follow 2017 and 2021, as the Halving event occurred this year. Related Reading: Here Are The Major Bitcoin Support Levels To Watch As Bulls Push For $100,000 Again In 2017, the Ethereum price enjoyed gains of 34%, 47%, and 215% in January, February, and March, respectively. Meanwhile, in 2021, Ethereum recorded gains of 78%, 7%, and 35% in the first three months of the year. Therefore, ETH could replicate such massive gains in the first quarter of next year. Based on this historical trend, crypto analyst Kaduna suggested that this isn’t the time to bearish on the Ethereum price, as he advised market participants not to fumble their ETH bags. The analyst added that ETH will lead the altcoin season, possibly as it replicates the 2017 and 2021 Q1 performances next year. This historical trend provides a bullish outlook for the Ethereum price, which has underperformed this year compared to other major cryptocurrencies. Ethereum boasts a meager year-to-date (YTD) gain of around 47%. Moreover, the second-largest crypto has struggled to hold above the psychological $4,000 level and has come nowhere close to its current all-time high (ATH) of $4,800. However, it is worth mentioning that the Ethereum price hit its current ATH in 2021. As such, if ETH replicates its 2021 run in 2025, then it could easily reach a new ATH. ETH’s Time Will Come Crypto analyst Ted provided a bullish outlook for the Ethereum price, stating that ETH’s time will soon come. The analyst cited another data, which shows that the first quarter of 2025 will be huge for Ethereum. He noted that ETH and BTC’s dominance move inversely during a bull run. Currently, Bitcoin’s dominance is on the verge of a big leg down, which is why Ted is confident that ETH will soon pump to new highs.

His accompanying chart showed that ETH could rebound towards $4,000.

As such, BTC is down over 11% from its $108k all-time high. However, the recent decline in the global money supply suggests that the crypto crash isn’t over just yet. Meanwhile, some smart money investors are already pivoting to presale tokens, with the likes of Wall Street Pepe in high demand. Bitcoin Price Crash - Is It Time To Sell BTC? Global Head of Technical Strategy at Fundstrat Mark Newton reveals that the Bitcoin price could dip to $60,000 early in 2025. While Fundstrat’s CEO Thomas Lee believes that BTC will eventually hit $250,000 next year, a dip to $60,000 is likely. Former White House Director of Communications also conceded this possibility. Similarly, former Wall Street quant Tone Vays reveals that Bitcoin’s range-bound movement near 95,000 is concerning. Vays highlights that the likelihood that BTC breaks down below $92,000 has considerably increased, which could result in a larger crash to $73,000. Legendary trader Peter Brandt has also cautioned the bulls. A breakdown below the current broadening triangle on the BTC price chart could result in a correction to $70,000. Turning doubters into believers since day one. 🐸 ⚔️ pic.twitter.com/usPUfQnhvD — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) December 26, 2024 Into The Cryptoverse ’s Benjamin Cowan also highlights the similarity between Bitcoin and NASDAQ (QQQ). If BTC continues to follow QQQ’s fractal, a flash crash to $60,000 could be on the cards, perhaps near Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20th. It is now imperative for the bulls to hold the $92,000 - $93,800 range in the coming days. A sustained close below it could pave the way for the aforementioned crypto crashes. On the contrary, a breakout above $97,300 - and eventually $100,000 - could result in new all-time highs. In this bullish scenario, prominent analyst Ali Martinez indicates that the Bitcoin price could hit $168,500. Are Presale Tokens The Best Crypto To Buy Now? Crypto presales are in high demand, especially as Bitcoin and large-cap altcoins are mired in uncertainty. A CoinDesk report reveals that ICOs could make a comeback in 2025 amidst improved regulatory clarity. A few presale tokens are already creating a strong buzz, with experts viewing them as some of the best cryptos to buy now. For instance, Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) has raised nearly $37 million in its ICO amidst heavy whale bidding and retail interest. Turning doubters into believers since day one. 🐸 ⚔️ pic.twitter.com/usPUfQnhvD — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) December 26, 2024 As such, smart money investors are bullish on frog meme coins, with many expecting Pepe to reach $50 billion in 2025. This scenario is positive for low-cap frog tokens as well. Wall Street Pepe’s key selling point is its exclusive trading alpha group, which will have all WEPE holders as its members. The project considers its core mission to challenge this hegemony of whales and offer a competitive edge to small-scale investors. As a result, the WEPE army will receive cutting-edge alpha calls, expert trading strategies and market insights. The members can also share their own trading setup and win attractive monetary perks if their setup proves to be profitable. WEPE holders are also benefitting from the project’s presale staking pool, which is currently offering a reward rate of 35%. Prominent crypto investors have already jumped on the bandwagon and are bullish on Wall Street Pepe’s upside, with many rating it among the best cryptocurrencies to buy now.

The U.S. and South Korean governments have both sought to take custody of Kwon to face criminal charges related to the collapse of the algorithmic stablecoin Terra/Luna system in 2022, which kicked off a series of high-profile collapses including that of FTX.    Kwon, who was arrested in Montenegro in March of 2023 and sentenced to a few months in prison over passport forgery charges, has been fighting his extradition to the U.S. for more than a year. Various courts in the country have ruled in favor of the U.S. or South Korea taking custody of the onetime crypto executive.   In his statement on Friday, Božović said his decision followed the country's Supreme Court ruling that the conditions for approving an extradition had been met.   ""Bearing in mind the verdict of the Supreme Court, the Ministry of Justice considered all the facts and circumstances and assessed criteria such as the gravity of the criminal acts, the place of execution, the order of submission of the request, the citizenship of the requested person, the possibility of further extradition to another country, as well as other circumstances,"" the statement said.  The U.S. bid met these criteria, the statement said.   Friday's announcement is just the latest in a string of back-and-forth decisions about where Kwon should be sent. The Appellate Court of Montenegro ruled in August of this year that Kwon should go to South Korea.  The legal fallout for Terra continues in the U.S. as well; last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission settled charges with Tai Mo Shan, a subsidiary of Jump Crypto, alleging Tai Mo Shan sold LUNA as a security. The company will pay $123 million as part of the settlement.

38195364,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634112,1735327012,Solana co-founder faces lawsuit from ex-spouse over staking profits,"Stephen Akridge, a co-founder of Solana, is in the middle of a courtroom showdown. His ex-wife, Elisa Rossi, has dragged him into a lawsuit claiming he made off with “millions of dollars” from her staking rewards. These are earnings generated by locking up Solana tokens to validate transactions—a common way crypto holders make passive income. Rossi says Akridge used his deep technical knowledge of the blockchain to siphon the profits from her Solana holdings. According to the lawsuit, filed in San Francisco Superior Court, the tokens were in her wallet, but the rewards somehow ended up in his hands. She accuses him of operating her staking accounts without permission and pocketing every dime. The legal battle is basically a crypto soap opera. Rossi and Akridge were married for ten years before filing for divorce in February 2023. The high stakes of staking rewards By pledging tokens to a blockchain network like Solana, users help validate transactions and secure the network, earning new tokens in return. Rossi’s complaint alleges that Akridge, with his background as a top blockchain engineer, used this mechanism against her. The exact amount of money in dispute isn’t clear, as portions of the lawsuit have been redacted. But Rossi has called the sums as “significant.” Considering Solana’s recent price recovery, they could easily be worth millions. Neither Akridge nor the Solana team has publicly commented on the case. He is now the CEO of Cyber Grant Inc. Solana’s controversial rise This lawsuit comes at a time when Solana itself is clawing its way back to prominence. The blockchain network has had a turbulent history. Launched in 2017, it wowed the crypto industry with its Proof-of-History consensus mechanism, allowing it to process up to 65,000 transactions per second. That speed put Solana on the map as a competitor to Ethereum in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). But Solana’s historic rise wasn’t without controversy. You see, the blockchain became closely linked to Sam Bankman-Fried and his trading firm, Alameda Research. So when FTX collapsed in late 2022, Solana’s price tanked, plunging below $10. Critics questioned its future. But fast forward to press time, and Solana has defied the odds. Its price skyrocketed to $265 in November before stabilizing around $241 in December. The blockchain now boasts a market cap of over $100 billion and a total value locked (TVL) of $9.35 billion in DeFi projects. It’s one of the most traded cryptos in the world, with daily volumes exceeding $6 billion. Though the network hasn’t been immune to technical hiccups, frequent outages have raised concerns about its reliability, even as its popularity among developers and investors grows. As for Akridge, this lawsuit could tarnish his legacy as one of Solana’s key builders. According to Rossi’s complaint, he was a principal engineer at Solana and worked alongside co-founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal to bring the blockchain to life.

Concurrently, Injective (INJ) is integrating AI to push the envelope in decentralized finance. Amid these developments, Web3Bay is setting the stage for a significant evolution in blockchain-based e-commerce. Currently, in its exciting presale phase, Web3Bay offers the 3BAY token at just $0.003. This token is central to the platform, enabling governance, rewards, and discounts for purchases, and it drives a system designed for transparency and security using IPFS technology. Cronos (CRO) at $100: A Realistic Goal? The prospect of Cronos (CRO) hitting $100 seems highly improbable.

Achieving such a high would require an unimaginable 137,074% increase, a scenario that stretches beyond realistic market expectations. Investors should temper their expectations, as the token is likely to see modest growth but not to the mythical $100 level anytime soon. Injective (INJ) Forges Ahead with AI-Enhanced DeFi Injective (INJ) is expanding its reach in blockchain finance by partnering with Fetch.ai and the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance. This collaboration is set to upgrade the DeFi landscape by integrating Injective’s robust blockchain technology with sophisticated AI from ASI.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Ripple and Dogecoin dip, but DTX Exchange surges with 500% returns, unique tools, and fast-growing presale momentum. Table of Contents DTX Exchange stands out with a 500% surge Ripple price sees a slight dip, analyst remains optimistic Jake Wujastyk: The price of Dogecoin may bounce soon What could come for DTX Exchange, Ripple & Dogecoin? The crypto market can be volatile at times. Right now, Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are suffering a bit, but a newcomer is on the rise. This newcomer is DTX Exchange (DTX) which is a phase six presale star. It has already onboarded over 300K users and raised over $10M. While experts like RippleLord and Jake Wujastyk remain optimistic about XRP and Dogecoin, many analysts predict DTX could be the next 3x crypto coin in 2025. Since its hybrid trading platform could revolutionize online trading, this price prediction may come true. DTX Exchange stands out with a 500% surge Ripple and Dogecoin are experiencing a downtrend, but DTX Exchange (DTX) seems to be bucking the trend. This project is now in its presale run, and early buyers have received a 500% return so far. Since there are more presale phases left, this percentage will continue rising. Essentially, DTX will power the DTX Exchange platform, which will launch in Q1 of 2025. On it, traders will get access to over 120K asset classes like bonds and crypto coins at up to 1000x leverage. Hype is growing for this project, which recently launched many products, like the VulcanX blockchain testnet, which sustained 100K TPS, the Phoenix wallet, and even a CoinMarketCap listing for DTX. This altcoin is currently worth just $0.12, but its price is expected to rise to $0.14 after phase seven starts. Moreover, a top-tier crypto exchange like Uniswap listing DTX is expected to push this value to $0.20. With this event, all those who buy DTX now could experience a 66% return, making DTX one of the top crypto coins for fast returns. Ripple price sees a slight dip, analyst remains optimistic Ripple is an altcoin that has been showing some red price charts. According to CoinMarketCap, the price of Ripple fell nearly 15% in the past week alone. During that time, its value moved between $2.50 and close to $2.20. Market analyst RippleLord, however, made some exciting statements. In a recent X post, he told his followers that this altcoin is now rising. As a Ripple price prediction, he foresees a surge to $5 soon. Although Ripple may rebound soon, its high market cap of $120B could slow its growth. As this crypto coin will need a large influx of new money to surge, many traders are turning to the DTX Exchange instead. Jake Wujastyk: The price of Dogecoin may bounce soon As one of the best meme coins, Dogecoin is now facing some challenges. Its price has decreased recently, falling over 25% in the past month alone. CoinMarketCap shows that the Dogecoin price moved between $0.40 and $0.30 on the monthly chart. Nevertheless, expert Jake Wujastyk excited traders with his Dogecoin price prediction. According to his X post, this meme coin could potentially bounce soon. Evidently, the Dogecoin crypto is preparing for an upward move as per his prediction. Even if Dogecoin soars soon, experts think its uptrend may not be noteworthy. Since this meme coin has surged over 200% on the YTD chart, its highest upswings may have passed. Therefore, traders are more interested in DTX right now. What could come for DTX Exchange, Ripple & Dogecoin? DTX Exchange, Ripple, and Dogecoin may see some big price gains soon. However, one of them stands out — DTX. This project is strategically positioning itself to capitalize on the growth of the $133T bonds market. With this connection, its long-term stability and growth potential could be higher. Plus, its smaller market cap could bring it faster gains. As a result, experts think DTX could be the next 3x crypto coin in 2025. For more information, visit the DTX Exchange presale website and join the online community.

Pseudonymous crypto trader Bluntz tells his 305,200 followers on social media platform X that HYPE , the native altcoin of decentralized perpetual trading platform and layer-1 blockchain Hyperliquid, may be due for a significant correction. According to Bluntz, who applies the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis, HYPE appears to have completed a five-wave rally and now looks as if it is entering an ABC corrective wave that may last into early next year. The Elliott Wave theory states that a bullish asset tends to witness an ABC correction after completing a five-wave upside move. “HYPE had a good run but peak mindshare and clear as day five wave rise from inception here. I think it sees a long slow bleed back down to minimum $20 in my opinion.” Source: Bluntz/X HYPE is trading for $26.98 at time of writing, up more than 600% from its $3.81 low on November 29th. However, fellow pseudonymous crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 236,200 followers on the social media platform X that HYPE will likely chop around a range with a bottom bound of $25 and an upper bound of $30 before breaking out. “HYPE back down to $25 now. This is the range we’re playing. HYPE will eventually be wild though when volumes start to ramp up and full-blown bull comes along. But let’s see.

Dubbed “Jupuary,” this event promises to distribute a massive 700 million JUP tokens, valued at $580 million, to users, stakers, and community contributors. Jupiter has designed the airdrop to engage its growing community and incentivize active participation, pushing its ecosystem to new heights. Jupiter’s Token Airdrop Aims to Reward Loyalty and Growth In January 2025, Jupiter will distribute 700 million JUP tokens to eligible users based on a previous snapshot. The community is still finalizing the exact eligibility criteria. The airdrop aims to reward those who have helped the platform grow. It also seeks to attract new users to the platform. Jupiter has divided the airdrop into two groups. This includes “users and stakers” and “Carrots and Good Cats,” which are names for active community supporters. The strategy is not only to reward loyalty but also to encourage future engagement. This approach aims to expand the Jupiter user base and to ensure the ecosystem thrives long after the airdrop event. Jupiter Airdrop to Reward Broader Community While the final rules are still being worked out, a draft of the eligibility guidelines has already been proposed. For instance, users who have traded at least $800 in volume over the past year will get at least 50 JUP tokens. Those who have pushed higher trading volumes, around $29,000, could receive 250 tokens or more. Around 2.3 million wallets are expected to qualify, creating a diverse group of recipients. Notably, the upcoming January is not Jupiter’s first airdrop event. In 2023, the platform distributed nearly 1 billion JUP tokens to users who completed at least $1,000 in swap volume. However, Jupuary” is set to be more inclusive, offering more rewards to a larger part of the community. What Makes Jupiter Stand Out? Jupiter is making moves to grow its community and ensure that its token holds long-term value. Jupiter plans to reduce its total supply of tokens from 10 billion to 7 billion by burning over 3 billion JUP tokens. This community-backed decision will create scarcity, possibly increasing the token’s value and rewarding holders. The move is also part of a strategy to build a healthier, more sustainable ecosystem. Since launching in 2021, Jupiter has become a top DEX aggregator on the Solana network . The platform is prominent for offering users the best trade rates by pooling liquidity from multiple DEXs. In addition to token swaps, it now provides a perpetual trading product, attracting a wider decentralized finance (DeFi) audience. With a 24-hour trading volume of over $2.3 billion, Jupiter has established itself as a key player in the Solana ecosystem.

Dogecoin and PEPE’s prices dipped, with notable downturns of 27% and 14.5%, respectively. While Dogecoin is now changing hands at around $0.34, onlookers anticipate an uptick thanks to increased whale activity on Dogecoin’s market. DOGE has established support around the $0.3 zone, but PEPE’s price has been struggling to remain afloat after dipping past the $0.000015 support zone. While PEPE’s price has rebounded to $0.00001798, uncertainty persists. PEPE’s price and Dogecoin aside, crypto’s smart money is now moving to Remittix , which is a cross-border payment platform set to reinvent PayFi.

Dogecoin’s price plummets amid persisting bullish speculations DOGE holders have cushioned a 45% cut on their previous gains after DOGE’s price rallied all the way to $0.48, only to receive a massive rejection in the $0.5 zone. After dipping to lows of $0.26, DOGE is now on a recovery path as its price consolidates at the $0.34 region. Despite the downturn, DOGE’s bullish sentiments persist as some onlookers anticipate a bullish resurgence to targets as high as $0.684. DOGE is likely to face a lot of resistance at the $0.415 level, with even more short positions set at the $0.547 zone. If DOGE succeeds in surpassing these regions, its price could register an uptick to higher ATHs. PEPE’s price dips 14% as analysts anticipate higher highs Touted as the leading frog-themed meme coin, PEPE’s price surged to a new all-time high just two weeks ago but has registered a 37% dip from its peak, as seen by the latest market reports. PEPE’s price still demonstrates breakout signals that could see it surge over 70% now that its price is consolidating at the $0.00001792 mark. According to popular analysts, PEPE’s price has formed a bull flag, which typically signals an incoming trend reversal.

According to a prominent Dogecoin analyst, this emerging AI altcoin has the potential to replicate Dogecoin’s explosive 2021 success . This rising AI altcoin, PCHAIN , has caught the attention of analysts and enthusiasts alike due to its integration of cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) features, which many believe could position it as the next breakout star in the crypto market. By incorporating AI-driven functionalities such as predictive analytics, automated decision-making, and enhanced user experiences, PCHAIN aims to deliver practical utility and real-world applications in the $600 trillion global real estate market. AI integration within blockchain technology is rapidly becoming a key trend, and this AI altcoin uses it in ways that go beyond the speculative hype. Looking to replicate the Dogecoin 2021 success, this AI altcoin combines strong community backing, innovative technology, and real-world utility. The Al Altcoin Looking to Mirror the Dogecoin 2021 Success This AI altcoin in question is PCHAIN, the utility token of PropiChain, a blockchain-based real estate platform that uses cutting-edge technologies to power the future of global real estate. As a real-world asset (RWA) altcoin, PCHAIN bridges the gap between traditional real estate and the blockchain. Unlike Dogecoin, which gained popularity primarily through its meme culture and community-driven hype, this AI-powered altcoin is carving a niche by offering practical applications and utility within the multi-trillion-dollar real estate industry. Analysts see parallels between the growing community support for this PCHAIN and the fervent enthusiasm that fueled the Dogecoin rally in 2021. Key AI Features of PCHAIN and its Impact on the Real Estate Market One of the standout features of this rising AI altcoin is its use of AI algorithms to provide real estate investors with 24/7 support throughout their real estate investment journey. With the help of AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants, PCHAIN ensures that the complexities of the real estate market are simplified for all investors. Additionally, the altcoin incorporates AI-powered predictive market analytics to help investors make informed decisions. This feature provides real-time insights into market trends, price forecasts, and risk assessments, making it an attractive option for both novice and seasoned real estate investors. The integration of AI not only improves user experience but also fosters trust and transparency within the ecosystem. Another groundbreaking aspect of PCHAIN’s use of AI is to enable smart contracts that can adapt to changing conditions. Unlike traditional smart contracts, which are rigid and require manual updates, AI-driven smart contracts can dynamically adjust their parameters based on pre-defined algorithms. This innovation has the potential to revolutionize the $600 trillion global real estate market by automating complex processes with greater efficiency. Taking a Cue from The Dogecoin 2021 Playbook The Dogecoin rise in 2021 was largely driven by its vibrant community and strategic marketing efforts, including endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk. The AI altcoin is taking a page out of the Dogecoin playbook by actively engaging with its community through social media campaigns and several other initiatives. These efforts aim to build a loyal user base that can amplify the altcoin’s reach and adoption. However, PCHAIN’s focus on real-world utility and innovation rather than hype gives it a competitive edge over Dogecoin. Unlike Dogecoin, this AI altcoin offers practical solutions to real-world problems bedevilling the real estate market. Its ability to attract institutional interest will further boost its chances of achieving widespread adoption. PropiChain’s Cutting-Edge Technologies to Power the Future of Real Estate Aside from AI, PropiChain , the parent project of this AI altcoin, also deploys smart contracts, the Metaverse, and RWA tokenization technology to power the future of global real estate. PropiChain has revolutionized the real estate market by integrating the Metaverse to enable virtual reality and 3D visualization for property exploration. This innovative feature allows investors to carry out virtual tours of properties anywhere across the globe, eliminating the need for physical visits. The platform’s blockchain-powered tokenization of real-world assets signifies a groundbreaking shift in the real estate industry. By digitizing physical real estate properties on the blockchain, PropiChain enables fractional ownership, allowing individuals with modest capital to invest in portions of high-value properties. This democratized approach broadens access to premium real estate markets and attracts a diverse pool of investors. Additionally, PropiChain uses smart contracts to automate key operations, such as property leasing and lease renewals. These automated processes minimize the need for intermediaries, thereby reducing costs and saving time while enhancing transparency and operational efficiency in real estate transactions. The platform’s strategy of inclusivity and innovation ensures a wide-reaching impact. By lowering entry barriers and optimizing property management, PropiChain is setting new benchmarks for accessibility, efficiency, and technological advancement within the real estate sector. Conclusion This Dogecoin analyst is upbeat that this AI altcoin, PCHAIN, will replicate the 12,000% rally of DOGE in 2021. Combining its real-world utility and community-driven feature, PCHAIN is poised to surpass the 12,000% price rally. According to the analyst, if you invest $1000 in the ongoing PCHAIN presale, it will be worth over $120,000 by 2025. PCHAIN raised over $1.3 million during its first presale round and has already surpassed the $500,000 mark in the ongoing second presale round. This is a testament to investors’ confidence in the project’s potential to yield massive gains for early investors. After this 2nd presale round, the price will increase from $0.011 to $0.023. Join the presale now to enjoy massive gains on your investment and have early access to the $600 trillion global real estate market.

PEPE, a meme-based cryptocurrency, has recently surged past an $11 billion market capitalization, briefly overtaking Uniswap’s UNI token. This rapid ascent has captured the attention of traders seeking high-growth opportunities. Concurrently, Lightchain AI’s presale is gaining momentum, attracting interest from investors looking for innovative blockchain solutions. Priced at just $0.003 per token, LCAI offers an accessible entry point for those interested in the convergence of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Analysts project that Lightchain AI could experience substantial appreciation, with potential returns of up to 99x by 2025. This shift in trader attention from DOGE and SHIB to PEPE and LCAI underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market, where new projects can rapidly gain prominence, influencing trading strategies and market trends. In this article, we will explore the recent developments in PEPE and LCAI and their potential impact on the broader cryptocurrency landscape. The Rise of PEPE PEPE, a meme-inspired cryptocurrency, has experienced a remarkable surge, capturing the attention of investors and the broader crypto community. In late April to May 2023, PEPE’s market capitalization soared to $1.6 billion, creating significant wealth for early adopters and attracting a dedicated following. This meteoric rise can be attributed to several factors: Viral Appeal : Leveraging the popularity of the “Pepe the Frog” meme, PEPE resonated with a wide audience, driving mass adoption. Community Engagement : A strong, active community fostered a sense of belonging and collective investment, propelling the token’s growth. Strategic Listings : PEPE’s inclusion on major exchanges like Coinbase and Robinhood enhanced its accessibility and liquidity, attracting a broader investor base. Despite its speculative nature, PEPE’s rise underscores the significant impact of community-driven projects in the cryptocurrency market. Its journey from a meme to a multi-billion-dollar asset highlights the volatile yet dynamic nature of digital currencies. The Promise of Lightchain AI Lightchain AI is ready to change the blockchain world by mixing smart machines (AI) with spread out tech. Unlike old blockchain networks, Lightchain AI makes the whole system better by adding AI-based fixes that boost how well things work ͏and grow. A main change is the system’s smart helper check, which makes deal approval faster and boosts total speed. Also, Lightchain AI’s skill to allow spread out smart work helps with better data using, making clever agreements grow and adapt based on up-to-the-minute facts Lightchain AI wants to make smart choices right on the blockchain. It aims to help areas like supply chain work, money, and AI study. With its strong token plan and a clear path for growth, Lightchain AI is ready to create new rules in blockchain tech, giving easy, safe, and quick answers for the rising need of decentralized AI apps 15$ LCAI: An Opportunity for Investors Lightchain AI (LCAI) presents a compelling investment opportunity, with projections suggesting a potential rise to $15 per token. Currently priced at $0.003 during its presale , early investors could see substantial returns as the project progresses. Analysts predict that LCAI’s innovative integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology positions it for significant appreciation, with some forecasts indicating a 20x increase in value. The platform’s unique features, such as the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), address critical challenges in scalability and efficiency, enhancing its long-term viability. As industries like finance, healthcare, and supply chain management increasingly adopt decentralized AI solutions, LCAI’s utility and demand are expected to grow, potentially driving its price toward the $15 mark. Investing in LCAI during its presale phase offers an accessible entry point, with the possibility of significant returns as the project advances and gains market traction. However, it’s essential to conduct thorough research and consider the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency investments.

As a result, investors are considering new altcoin alternatives like Propichain that offer high-profit potential. Keep reading to see why analysts say Propichain’s AI-driven altcoin could be the next top performer in the market. Bitcoin Price Analysts Expect a Mega Surge In Q1 2025 Bitcoin price predictions for early 2025 paint a very bullish performance for the top cryptocurrency. Since the early November rally, the Bitcoin price has consistently reached new all-time highs as the market was overwhelmed with bullish sentiments. On December 17, the Bitcoin price reached a new all-time high of $108,268. However, the Bitcoin price has faced a slight correction that has affected its momentum, taking it to $97,215. Analysts have pinned the Bitcoin price correction on profit-taking by traders who held long BTC positions. Furthermore, analysts believe in a strong price recovery. These analysts cite the expectation of a pro-crypto stance from the incoming Trump administration. This would further boost Bitcoin’s institutional adoption, resulting in higher demand for its ETF products. If this happens, the Bitcoin price rally will gain extra momentum. While the Bitcoin price correction has tempered short-term momentum, its long-term prospects remain strong. As crypto enthusiasts look to capitalize on ongoing market trends, many are turning their attention to Propichain’s presale, which offers unique opportunities in the real estate sector Propichain: Leveraging Blockchain Technology to Create Global Access to Housing Markets Propichain is a new crypto ecosystem focused on helping investors better capitalize on profit opportunities in the housing sector.

38194794,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634105,1735325803,Crypto funding grows again in December after a series of late-stage rounds,"Crypto funding changed direction in Q4, with much larger rounds adding to the final balance of the year. Previously, a slowdown was seen among early-stage investments. December’s VC funding reached the highest levels for Q4 , extending the trend from October to November. VC funding expansion coincided with ‘Uptober’ and the most dramatic market recovery for the year. December’s funding crossed the $3B mark, driven by late-stage and OTC or undisclosed rounds. The month showed extreme growth compared to December 2023, where rounds were capped at $1B. Investments expanded by 72% from the previous month, as large-scale private deals were closed in December. | Source: Cryptorank More than 37.9% of all deals in December were from undisclosed or unannounced categories. Still, around 30% of investors supported seed rounds, showing confidence in the crypto market potential to support a new batch of startups. The last month of the year closes a volatile period, where funding ranged from a minimum of $640.75M in February, to December’s record, with an average of $1B in monthly funding for most of the year. In December, VC funds set the record for the whole year, as monthly funding returned to levels not seen since the summer of 2022. The current rounds targeted advanced-stage projects, surpassing the share of seed rounds. More than 26% of all deals went to Ai projects, with activities ranging from rented GPU to chatbots. VC-backed deals expanded even as communities turned their liquidity to meme tokens. December was relatively active for ICO and IDO services, with $68.22M raised for the past month, a slight decrease from November. December investment included high-rate deals and undisclosed OTC rounds Investment volume is up more than 72% from the previous month, bringing a strong close to 2024. The biggest deal for the month was a $250M private late-stage round for Avalanche. December ended with 167 rounds in total, with most deals in the early seed stage. However, the large number of $3M to $10M deals was offset by several outliers and deals that were external to the crypto space. When it came to small rounds, Animoca Brands was still the leader with 109 deals in the past 30 days. OKX Ventures followed with 84 deals. In December, the Tether deal with Rumble, valued at $775M, was counted toward total funding, though it was not representative of overall VC sentiment. ALLO was another deal that locked in $100M through debt financing, not constrained by VC’s readiness to invest. CleanSpark and RIOT issued post-ICO debt. The past month also saw multiple OTC deals of undisclosed size in a year-end funding frenzy. US investment drove VC funding in 2024 Most of the VC deals were tied to US startups, and came from US-based funds. One of the reasons for the accelerated funding in November and December was the US election result, which pointed to an upcoming crypto-friendly administration in the USA. Other countries with an active VC climate included Singapore, the United Kingdom, China, and the UAE. Germany was the leader among EU countries, with more than $101M in deals for the past year. The previous years of regulatory oversight saw the US Securities and Exchange Commission essentially punish crypto startups with protracted lawsuits, which discouraged investment. Angel investors also set the trend for picking up AI projects, followed by DeFi, infrastructure, DEX, and another attempt at funding NFT projects. Some angel investors are also betting on L1 and L2 infrastructure, as there is still competition between chains.

Kaspa: A high-Throughput Cryptocurrency Utilizing the GHOSTDAG Protocol Kaspa is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that uses the GHOSTDAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchains, GHOSTDAG allows blocks created in parallel to coexist and orders them in consensus. This means the Kaspa blockchain is a block Directed Acyclic Graph (blockDAG). This approach extends Nakamoto consensus, enabling secure operation with very high block rates — currently one block per second, with goals of 10 per second and aspirations for 100 per second. Confirmation times are minimal, mainly limited by internet latency. Kaspa includes features like Reachability for querying the DAG’s topology, block data pruning, SPV proofs, and planned subnetwork support to simplify future layer 2 solutions. These innovations aim to improve scalability and transaction speeds in cryptocurrency networks. XRP: A fast, low-cost cryptocurrency for global transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency that operates on the XRP Ledger. It is designed to be fast, low-cost, and open. XRP allows for borderless transactions that are resistant to censorship and counterfeiting. It does not rely on a central authority, making transactions secure and irreversible. XRP was created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz. They launched it with a supply of 100 billion tokens. Ripple received 80 billion XRP to improve network liquidity and support the ecosystem. Ripple uses XRP to facilitate quick and efficient transfers across different currencies. In the current market cycle, XRP’s technology and potential applications may make it an interesting option for global payments. Conclusion While KAS and XRP show limited short-term potential, DOGEN emerges as a token catering to those seeking luxury and success. With an expected 700% growth by presale’s end and prospects of thousand-fold returns this altcoin season, DOGEN mirrors the success of tokens like BONK and Popcat, building a community of leaders and offering real benefits to early adopters.

PEPE surged by over 1100% in 2024 alone and is now an incredible 30,560% higher than its launch value in April 2023. With a market cap exceeding $11 billion, Pepe Coin continues to attract investors, and its price is forecasted to rise from its current value of $0.00001725 to $0.00005 by 2025. Similarly, SHIB has shown impressive performance since it was listed in 2020, growing by 1,619,581%. In 2024, the token grew by 110% to reach its current value of $0.00002162. Analysts are expecting further growth of 100% in 2025, with a potential target of $0.000049. A New Altcoin Emerges with High Potential This new altcoin is expected to be the next, following a similar trajectory to that of Pepe Coin and Shiba Inu. Currently in its presale phase, 1Fuel OFT has already surpassed 55% completion of Stage 2, following a rapid completion of Stage 1 in just a few days. This impressive momentum has positioned 1Fuel OFT as a top presale cryptocurrency. Savvy investors are recognizing the potential of 1Fuel OFT, especially since its backed by a reliable DEX wallet that stands out from Ledger and Trust Wallet. 1Fuel OFT is being offered at a price of $0.012 per token, and this is expected to be its lowest price ever. Investors are expecting 1Fuel OFT to increase by 88x once it is publicly listed, which is why they are rushing to accumulate it during the presale. 1Fuel OFT Stands as a Top Contender in the DeFi Space 1Fuel has emerged as a top contender in the DeFi space, especially as the OFT token is backed by a robust DEX wallet. Its cutting-edge features and user-centric design are driving value, making it a top presale cryptocurrency. One of the standout features is its seamless cross-chain transaction capability, offering a one-click solution that gives it an edge over Ledger and Trust Wallet. 1Fuel OFT also prioritizes user privacy through its inbuilt mixer and disposable wallets, providing a level of anonymity that is not offered by popular wallets like Trust Wallet and Ledger. The wallet’s integration with debit and credit cards, P2P exchange, and AI-driven tools offers a complete ecosystem. As investors look ahead, 1Fuel OFT has become one of the top altcoins for the 2025 bull run. With all of these features, 1Fuel is expected to explode in value once it is publicly listed next year. Investors Prepare for the 2025 Crypto Bull Run As investors prepare for the 2025 crypto bull run, they are interested in new altcoins like 1Fuel OFT. Some cryptocurrencies have shown sky-high growth in a short term, like PEPE and SHIB, and OFT is expected to be the next. The presale offers the best opportunity for investors to trade 1Fuel before the value explodes.

Wallstreet Queen Official Wallstreet Queen official Telegram channel Wallstreet Queen Official is a good channel to follow to get oriented in the world of signals.

The channel offers free content with price ranges for entrances and exits, tracking the most prominent and active coins and tokens. The busiest version of Wallstreet Queen Official has more than 219K users and has covered crypto cycles since 2021. The channel covers both Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins with relatively generic advice. As with other signal and trading tip channels, Wallstreet Queen Official will try to upsell its VIP and special packages.

Trade Watcher is a good resource for beginner traders to connect macro insights to the movements of BTC. Trade Watcher tracks general stock index movements and previews the latest market news. 14. OTC buying and selling This channel is one of the riskiest on Telegram, connecting users directly to other accounts to buy and sell coins and tokens.

The OTC buying and selling channel, also known as OTC ICOBOG, has only 54K subscribers, but more than 10K are active anytime.

What are the benefits of using Telegram channels? The crypto market is in constant flux, with multiple social media influences. Using a crypto telegram group helps follow market trends with aggregated content. Here are some of the benefits of using Telegram channels: The crypto space also contains multiple topics, and crypto groups on Telegram help make sense with niche specialization. Telegram groups often focus on crypto signals, market analysis, market data, or building a crypto community. Telegram groups are suitable for both beginner and experienced traders, pointing toward profitable trades. Signal providers will also run some of the top crypto Telegram channels, offering market insights and a trading strategy suitable for a new or experienced trader. How to verify Telegram channels Telegram groups and crypto telegram channels will often have copycats or similar communities. The best way is to choose the one with the biggest number of subscribers, checked through the statistics page. Some of the best Telegram groups are created by crypto enthusiasts, offering risk management tips. To find crypto groups, look through the Telegram statistics page or another preferred platform and vet each channel before joining. Even after joining a channel, avoid answering DM from users and do not click on links. Telegram channels are a tool for making informed decisions, and some have a proven track record of accurate signals and successful trades. However, crypto trading has inherent risks, even with daily trading signals. Paid vs free Telegram channels There are thousands of free crypto Telegram groups and channels. However, some of them offer fewer signals or keep the best crypto signals for their paid subscribers. Paid Telegram groups and channels claim to offer deeper insights and more reliable signals. Those paid channels often charge significant subscription fees, and there is no guarantee that their tips will lead to good trading outcomes or predict market developments. The best approach is to complete your own research before following any advice from a crypto pump club or a paid channel. Conclusion Telegram is the preferred platform of millions of crypto traders. Crypto telegram groups and Telegram channels are a source of crypto insights, trading strategy advice, and market insights. The best telegram crypto groups help analyze market data, offering fundamental analysis and risk management strategies. Market conditions in crypto are always shifting, and trading outcomes are not guaranteed. However, using a crypto Telegram group or channel is the best tool to aggregate data and build a reference for market trends.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/25-best-crypto-telegram-channels/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38194250.jpeg

In his statement, Kiyosaki claimed that BlackRock CEO Larry Fink may have been intentionally “dumping Bitcoin” to suppress its price and encourage institutional investors to accumulate the cryptocurrency at a lower cost. Kiyosaki cited concerns raised by Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who has previously criticized BlackRock’s approach. Ramaswamy warned that Fink and BlackRock, as advocates of “shareholder capitalism,” aligned with Marxist principles similar to those of World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab, according to Kiyosaki. Related News: Giant Whale, One of the First Ethereum Investors, Woke Up After 9 Years: Here's The Price He Bought Quoting Schwab’s famous claim that “one day you will own nothing and be happy,” Kiyosaki reiterated his belief in Bitcoin’s decentralization and security. “I like Bitcoin in my own wallet. I wouldn’t trust Bitcoin in BlackRock’s ETF,” he stated. Kiyosaki suggested that BlackRock may be deliberately driving down the price of Bitcoin to attract “whales” to buy at prices below $100,000. Despite this speculation, he remains hopeful about BTC’s long-term value. “I will continue to buy more Bitcoin because Bitcoin will go higher,” Kiyosaki said, predicting that Bitcoin could rise to $350,000 by 2025. *This is not investment advice.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/winter-pepe-pepewint-solana-memecoin-to-surge-17000-ahead-of-exchange-listings-while-shib-doge-and-bonk-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
38193909,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/the-leader-of-the-future-among-defi-projects,1735324777,The leader of the future among DeFi projects?,"In the world of cryptocurrencies, the names of such giants as Polkadot (DOT) and Avalanche (AVAX) are getting louder and louder. However, Nebula Stride (NST) - an ambitious project that is rapidly gaining momentum and offers truly unique solutions - is increasingly standing out against their background. Why Nebula Stride? 1. Focus on real-world assets (RWA) The tokenization market is valued at a whopping $379 trillion, and Nebula Stride is already implementing tools to “digitize” real assets. This paves the way for the project to reach a huge audience and make a real impact beyond the crypto industry. 2. Multichain infrastructure Support for multiple networks (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, etc.) gives users more flexibility and options for transferring assets. Meanwhile, QuickMint Bot makes it easy for even beginners to create tokens, and the NFT platform opens doors to digital art. 3. Strong Tokenomics Total Supply Distribution: 2,000,000,000 NST Pre-sale - 25% (500 000 000) Staking - 15% (300 000 000) Liquidity - 10% (200 000 000) Team&Developers - 7% (140 000 000) Partners - 3% (60 000 000) Marketing - 15% (300 000 000) Giveaways - 2% (40 000 000) Community - 3% (60 000 000) Ecosystem - 5% (100 000 000) Reserve - 5% (100 000 000) Airdrop - 10% (200 000 000) 4. Comparison with competitors - Polkadot (DOT) is known for interoperability but requires deep technical knowledge. - Avalanche (AVAX) is impressive for its speed and low fees, but it has poor integration with the real economy. Nebula Stride combines the pros - scalability, speed, and user simplicity. In doing so, RWA's unique niche creates long-term value and real benefit. Up to $50 and beyond? Analysts note that Nebula Stride, while in its early stages, has the potential to grow to over 100x. Against Polkadot and Avalanche's valuations of tens of billions of dollars, NST could reach $50 as early as the next 12-18 months, and up to $100 in the next few years if functionality is expanded. Experts' forecasts NST price growth: Taking into account the current RWA market and the constantly growing community, the price of $50 within 1–1.5 years looks quite realistic. Ecosystem development: The release of new DeFi tools and referral programs can accelerate progress and significantly increase the valuation of the project. One of the key differentiators for Nebula Stride is its commitment to bridging the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized universe.

38197649,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323093,1735324621,MOVE Airdrop Mania Takes Over – Could 2025 Be the Year of Massive Airdrops?,"The native token of the layer-two Ethereum network Movement has delivered significant gains to investors who were eligible to receive its airdrop on December 9. Within the first 24 hours, the token’s price rose from around $0.70 to over $2 at some point the day after the airdrop. Although the price has settled above the $1 mark since then, $MOVE is still producing a 59% return since its launch according to data from CoinMarketCap. It's been two weeks since $MOVE TGE! So far, the vast majority of people have opted to claim $MOVE on Movement Public Mainnet. This accounts for about $314M (so far). What a big two weeks! Many more coming pic.twitter.com/rcSZHJVeNw — Movement Network Foundation (@movementfdn) December 23, 2024 Its success has been primarily aided by Binance’s support of the project and the decision from other major crypto exchanges like Coinbase to enable MOVE trading within their platforms. Movement’s market cap currently stands at $2.36 billion while its trading volume sits at $800 million or a third of its market cap in the past 24 hours. During its launch, trading volumes surged to a staggering total of $6.34 billion. The MOVEDrop, as the event was called, allocated 10% of the token’s total supply to early adopters and die-hard supporters of the protocol. Meanwhile, 22.5% of its supply went to early investors who participated in its presale in April this year. The maximum supply of the token is 10 billion of which 2.25 billion approximately are currently in circulation. This means that once these additional tokens start to be released, the market cap of the project could rise as long as the price holds. The Movement network aims to solve the scalability issues that have prevented the Ethereum network from becoming the preferred smart contracts network for developers. The project simplifies the structure of smart contracts used for basic tasks like transferring assets or minting new assets to increase the number of transactions per second (TPS) that can be processed in the Ethereum blockchain. MOVE Settles and Starts to Move Upwards Once Again The crypto market has been recovering from the pullback it experienced shortly after the Federal Reserve made hawkish comments about its monetary policy and outlook for inflation in the United States. Although the price of MOVE collapsed to around $0.60 just 9 days after its airdrop, it has been progressively recovering to the $1 level and has made two higher highs along the way since December 21. The chart above indicates that the price action has formed an ascending price channel. This is a formation that indicates that the prevailing trend’s direction is upward. The $1.2 mark is currently the most relevant resistance to overcome based on this 1-hour chart. It is worth noting that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) exhibited a bearish divergence during the latest price increase.who ha However, that signal may have already exhausted its expected outcome, which means that MOVE could soon make another push toward this area of resistance. Trading volumes at the moment are way lower than they were after the airdrop. Investors should keep track of how the demand for the token behaves in the following days as a push above $1.2 that is accompanied by volumes exceeding $1.5 billion or so may indicate that traders are ready to take the token to new heights. The favorable conditions of the market following Donald Trump’s victory and analysts’ opinion that alt-coin season could be about to start are considered a tailwind to crypto projects that have been waiting for the right time to launch their corresponding airdrops. The success of the MOVE airdrop could pave the way for other projects like the Solana-based meme coin minting platform Pump.fun and the decentralized social media platform Farcaster. This Solana Layer-Two Project Has Already Raised $6M from Investors During its Presale The $MOVE airdrop was quite profitable for investors who poured money into the project at an early stage. However, identifying and participating in presale events is often reserved for deep-pocketed investors. This is not the case for Solaxy , a layer-two Solana protocol that aims to solve the congestion issues that have prevented the network from surpassing Ethereum as the go-to smart contracts blockchain of the crypto space. Solaxy’s goal is similar to Movement. It aims to reduce network congestion by bundling transactions offline to alleviate the mainnet. In just a few days, the Solaxy presale has raised $6.2 million from investors as its value proposition has already proven successful in other instances. Its utility token $SOLX is being offered at a discounted price of $0.001582 but the offer will expire in less than 40 hours. Perhaps you missed the $MOVE airdrop but you can still take part in this appealing presale event that could deliver 10X gains to early investors once the token is listed on major exchanges. To buy $SOLX, visit the official website of Solaxy and connect your wallet. You can convert ETH, USDT, or BNB tokens or use a bank card to complete your purchase. Once the presale ends, these tokens will be deposited in your wallet automatically.

Three Altcoins That Could Rewrite The Crypto Leaderboard,"Hyperliquid was expected to dominate the futures market in 2025 but allegations about criminal activity have made investors lose confidence. Pepe’s market volume has also reached a record high this week but the memecoin’s price action has remained underwhelming. Meanwhile, Rollblock is ready to capture a large share of the $500 billion global gambling market with its blockchain-powered DeFi casino. Rollblock (RBLK): The Disruptive GameFi Ecosystem Positioned for 100x Growth in 2025 Rollblock’s GameFi project boasts a revolutionary approach that combines the fun of centralized gaming with the gains of decentralized finance. More than 35,000 daily active users have already signed up on Rollblock, highlighting the strong investor confidence in this new project. Rollblock has already raised more than $7.74 million in presale, with analysts expecting the platform to earn a huge chunk of the $500 billion global gambling market in 2025. Rollblock’s ecosystem is powered by the native $RBLK token that combines play-to-earn benefits with the utility of DeFi altcoins. Rollblock players earn $RBLK as in-game rewards with the platform’s 7,000+ AI-powered games. These tokens can be used to access exclusive games on Rollblock’s GameFi ecosystem, boosting the token’s demand on the open market. Alternatively, traders can also add $RBLK to their staking pools to earn a passive income. Staking $RBLK gives traders daily rewards, allowing them to grow their income over time. Rollblock also shares up to 30% of its weekly revenue with long-term investors, giving them an even bigger piece of the pie. This revenue-sharing mechanism begins with Rollblock using up to 30% of its revenue to purchase $RBLK on the open market. Up to 40% of the repurchased tokens are distributed as staking rewards while the remaining 60% are removed from Rollblock’s circulating supply forever. The buyback mechanism injects a new wave of demand for $RBLK on the open market while the token burn keeps supply scarce, making $RBLK’s price highly deflationary over time. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Loses Investor Confidence After Massive Security Concern Hyperliquid was experiencing an explosive trend on the open market, recording nearly 690% gains in less than a month of its launch. However, Hyperliquid is now in troubled waters as experts predict Hyperliquid has been hacked by the North Korean Lazarus Group. This issue was uncovered on Twitter when a leading analyst claimed that Hyperliquid was being used by hackers associated with DPRK for criminal activities. A few hours later, Hyperliquidrecorded net withdrawals worth $256 million. Hyperliquid has tried to mitigate the situation by issuing an official statement about no DPRK exploits or loss of user funds, but the damage has already been done. Hyperliquid’s trading price is down to $25.42 after another intraday decrease of 8.07%, with investors constantly pulling their money out. Hyperliquid is unlikely to outlive these allegations, putting HYPE in a difficult position in 2025. Pepe (PEPE) Falls into Red Zone Again Despite High Network Activity Pepe was expected to witness a rebound before the end of 2024 but all signs are pointing towards a steeper decline. Pepe witnessed intense market activity on December 25, with more than 1.14 trillion PEPE traded. Analysts interpreted this network activity as a bullish signal as investors showed a renewed interest in the meme coin. However, bearish clouds have formed over Pepe once again as it tests a critical support level at $0.00001732. Pepe is currently trading for $0.00001756 after an intraday decrease of 5.07%. Pepe’s MACD Level is also suggesting a strong downward trend, with analysts expecting Pepe’s price to crash to $0.00001005 soon. HYPE and PEPE are No Match for Rollblock’s Disruptive Potential Hyperliquid’s downtrend is expected to continue in 2025 while Pepe’s ability to make a comeback remains uncertain. Keeping these failing cryptos in mind, savvy traders are moving their money towards Rollblock’s disruptive GameFi project that is already poised for 100x gains in early 2025.

38193978,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634096,1735324461,The dollar is headed for its best year in nearly a decade,"The US dollar is absolutely crushing it this year. It’s on track to clock its best performance since 2015, riding high on the back of a powerhouse US economy, a cautious Federal Reserve, and market enthusiasm fueled by President-elect Donald Trump’s aggressive tariff threats. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index , which tracks the currency’s performance against a basket of global peers, has already jumped more than 7% in 2024, cementing the dollar’s supremacy in a world where other currencies are barely keeping up. The greenback even hit a two-year high earlier this month after the Federal Reserve trimmed rates slightly but made it clear they weren’t rushing to slash further. Global currencies in free fall While the dollar is out here thriving, its competitors are flatlining. The yen, Norwegian krone, and New Zealand dollar have all tanked by more than 10% against the dollar this year. It’s a bloodbath for the euro too, which has lost about 5.5% of its value, now at $1.04. And it doesn’t stop there. Analysts are bracing for the euro to hit parity with the dollar next year. The global FX market isn’t just taking Ls—it’s getting battered by speculative traders doubling down on the dollar. Non-commercial traders have piled up $28.2 billion worth of bullish contracts tied to the greenback, the most since May. According to Goldman Sachs analysts, markets are still underestimating the impact of Trump’s protectionist tariffs. “Dollar strength is consistent with incoming data,” the analysts wrote, adding that the US economy might keep outperforming despite global trade tensions. If you’re watching the dollar index, it’s set to end the year with a 6% gain. For context, that’s like LeBron James dropping 50 points on a court full of middle-schoolers. Against the yen, the dollar has soared nearly 12% this year. Despite a slight pullback, the euro remains stuck at its lowest level in two years. Japan’s central bank isn’t doing much to fight back either. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) just left rates untouched, with Governor Kazuo Ueda saying he’d rather “wait for clarity” on Trump’s policies. It’s a hesitant move, but who can blame them? Fed, Treasury yields, and Trump Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is playing a calculated game. Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, announced earlier this month that rate cuts will be slow and steady. This has traders betting on fewer cuts in 2025—only 37 basis points are priced in, and the first full cut isn’t expected until June. But Treasury yields are adding fuel to the dollar’s fire. The 10-year yield climbed to 4.641% earlier this week, its highest since May, and the two-year yield is holding steady at 4.32%. Higher yields mean more demand for US assets, which keeps the dollar strong. And then there’s Trump. Love him or hate him, his plans for tariffs, deregulation, and tax cuts are sending shockwaves through the global economy. Economists see his policies as both pro-growth and inflationary, giving the dollar another edge. While other central banks like the European Central Bank (ECB) are bracing for deep rate cuts—possibly as much as a full percentage point next year—the US is holding the line. The collateral damage: Commodities and crypto The dollar’s rise is putting pressure on other markets too. Gold, the classic “safe haven” asset, dipped 0.84% to $2,612.20 per ounce. Even with this drop, it’s on track for a 27% annual gain, the best performance since 2011. Blame geopolitical tensions and inflation fears for that one. Oil is also feeling the heat. Brent crude futures ticked up 1% to $73.99 a barrel, but the market is nervously waiting on China’s next move. The world’s largest crude importer is expected to announce new economic stimulus measures, which could shake things up. And then there’s Bitcoin. The king of crypto is sitting at $93,752.64 as of December 27. It’s down slightly from its daily high of $97,554 but still riding an epic rally. Bitcoin’s market cap stands at $1.86 trillion, with $48.49 billion in trading volume over the last 24 hours. Traders are bracing for chaos as $14.5 billion worth of Bitcoin options expire today. Call options are outpacing puts by a massive margin, meaning the sentiment is still pretty bullish. If Bitcoin closes above $105,000, it could lock in serious momentum heading into 2025.

False Data Sparks Market Turbulence Cointelegraph Markets Pro recorded a sharp 4% drop in Bitcoin’s price, ending the calm trading environment of the Christmas period. BTC/USD briefly fell toward $95,000 as a TradingView anomaly inaccurately indicated Bitcoin’s market dominance had plummeted to 0%. The issue, since resolved, appeared to drive panic among traders. “So there was a TradingView glitch surrounding $BTC dominance and this caused people to panic dump? People now dumping over TradingView?” trader Satoshi Flipper questioned on X. Monitoring platform CoinGlass reported that approximately $33 million in BTC long positions were liquidated within a four-hour span. Bitcoin Dominance Trends and Altcoin Outlook Bitcoin’s market dominance has been a hot topic among traders. Recent all-time highs for BTC have left altcoins struggling to keep pace. Bitcoin dominance peaked at 61.5% in mid-November but has since declined, fueling speculation about an impending “altseason.” “BTC Dominance reached 2021 breakdown level and rejected,” trading account Aqua noted on X. “I think BTC Dominance peaked and ALTs will start outperforming $BTC in the coming months. Finally we will see true ALTs season soon.” Trader and analyst Michaël van de Poppe drew comparisons between current altcoin valuations and the Dotcom bubble of the early 2000s. “The Altcoin valuation are still substantially low. The total market capitalization is barely $1.5T. The Dot.com bubble was $10-15T,” he stated, predicting a significant surge in altcoin values by 2025. Optimism for Early 2025 Despite the temporary volatility, market sentiment remained optimistic.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XRP’s ETF ambitions and Ripple’s legal win could change crypto investing and drive institutional adoption. Table of Contents XRP’s ETF plans and DTX Exchange’s hybrid model open new doors for crypto growth 2025: A Defining year for XRP ETF approval And DTX Exchange’s growth in crypto investments Conclusion XRP has been a giant in cryptocurrency; however, if an XRP ETF is approved, its course will change. This discussion became necessary after Ripple’s partial legal victory at the hands of the SEC, denying the same XRP claims as security, as per the secondary sales. This became the golden opportunity for the institutional players to think of XRP as a legitimately enforced and regulated place for investing in the crypto market. Companies must be approached for XRP ETF applications, which include elite asset management firms like WisdomTree and Bitwise. The analysts are calling it the year of changes. Eventually, the pro-crypto sentiment will bring another era that can clear the passageway for all funds raised to finance XRP ETFs. If that happens, not only could Ripple attract huge inflows from types of institutions but memories of rally performances staged last year by contenders in the digital currency space could also be sparked by BTC and Ethereum. This application in an XRP ETF indicates the potential of top price appreciation while defining complete adoption, with XRP also evolving as the face of such a revolution. Thus, holders of that digital asset, XRP, are becoming significant favorites in the biggest market change in history. You might also like: Massive crash wipes $2 billion in Solana longs but DTX Exchange continues to new highs XRP’s ETF plans and DTX Exchange’s hybrid model open new doors for crypto growth XRP is rounding into the fact that it can present a new ETF, but under its radar, DTX Exchange is making stunning progress in offering an opportunity for investors. It is in the sixth presale stage and has raised a decent $10.5 million with a token price of $0.12. Below are just a few thoughts reported due to the planned selling price of $0.14. DTX is interesting because its hybrid exchange model provides centralized and decentralized features within the same platform. Very broad and universal asset classes exchanged on DTX are stocks, forex, ETFs, and cryptocurrencies- all within one platform. What makes this approach special is that one will definitely see an increase in demand for a less complex and multipurpose trading solution available in the coming years, thus contributing to the rejection of DTX by other firms. DTX’s governance design is another positive point as it concerns the advantages; participants can decide and participate in the trade fee revenue. Through this community-driven approach, the team’s excellence in user input can be gauged so that analysts view it among the significant participants in the crypto exchange industry. From the outset, the token has displayed a surge of more than 500% from its original price of $0.02. DTX brings forth the euphoria that early adopters always long to witness. 2025: A Defining year for XRP ETF approval And DTX Exchange’s growth in crypto investments This year 2025, is just another hurdle-beckoning year for speculative investors. The opportunity may follow XRP and DTX Exchange in the end. The expected approval of an XRP ETF will define Ripple in terms of financial world inclusion, just like an open door that will bring institutional money flowing in and prices to much higher levels. Indeed, with big automatic price hikes ahead, investors of Ripple now have to brace themselves for a mile-stormy year. At the same time, the success of DTX in its presale steps typifies the unique potential it harbors in trading. This is particularly so when coupled with the hybrid exchange’s engaging features and the generally healthy and active community backing; the platform is getting into shape, thus making it very attractive to all who want to diversify their portfolios. Early investors already cashing in on DTX should expect explosive growth, as occurred earlier in a similar year. Conclusion As we reach 2025, one thing is clear: two items strike XRP and DTX Exchange as the most exciting prospects for the cryptocurrency market. It means ETF approval, which will redefine how Ripple sits in a financial library and, more importantly, unleash a wave of institutional funds with anticipated high prices of XRP. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange currently represents the hottest bet mainly because of its hybrid exchange model and the powerful start of its presale. It is on course for a lot of returns. The message must be clear to an investor: Nip XRP right here, save some DTX in your basket and act eagerly in 2025. Whether you pitch an ETF-linked return by XRP or DTX’s novel methods in trading, earnings are and will be, for sure, enormous. Any involvement in the crypto market values high action, and the evolution chances stand precisely in these investments.

Bitget wallet, formerly known as BitKeep, is one of the world’s largest non-custodial multi-chain crypto wallets. It has a series of announcements that have shifted the trader’s attention over the ecosystem. One among them is the merger of it’s two native tokens, Bitget Token (BGB) and Bitget Wallet Token (BWB), aiming to combine both it’s exchange and wallet services with a unified token. With this, the social sentiments for both the tokens spiked and became the top token to be discussed. As per the data from Santiment , Bitget’s token merger along with Bitcoin attracted huge social sentiments, with increased discussion after Christmas. Bitget token (BGB) price rose above the prolonged consolidation after the market brokeout in the first week of November, but the rally intensified in December. Meanwhile, the merger also offered a massive bullish push that elevated the price by over 92% in the past seven days. Moreover, the token surged heavily and marked new highs at $8.49 in the early trading hours, bringing the token within the top 20 with a market capitalisation of over $11.2 billion. Besides, another native token, the Bitget Wallet token (BWB), also withnsessed a massive upswing and surged by over 65% to reach $0.69. The token also attracted millions in trading volume, which has already drained due to the merger as BGB will be the main token of the ecosystem. Therefore, the BGB price, which has already bagged a new ATH, is expected to maintain a healthy ascending trend and remain consistent within the discovery phase. The Bitget token (BGB) price is expected to break the $10 milestone in the first few weeks of 2025 and eventually reach a potential high of around $15.

38193737,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323158,1735323652,"Ethereum Price Set to Dip to $3,000 – Buy the Dip?","The Ethereum (ETH) price is on the back foot on Friday, the final trading day of the year in traditional financial markets, and is threatening a break back below $3,300. ETH’s recent rejection of resistance at $3,500 in the form of the 50DMA and some support-turned-resistance signals that the bears are currently in control of this market. The Ethereum price look to be at risk of a short-term dip back to $3,000, a key area of recent support, a key psychological level and where the 200DMA resides. ETH’s bearish price action began on the 18th of December, the day the Fed sent shockwaves through financial and crypto markets by signaling fewer than expected interest rate cuts in 2025. That spoilt the party in December for US equities and crypto, though most major cryptos, ETH included, are set to end the year with big gains. So, if the Ethereum price is on the cusp of a near-term drop to $3,000, should investors be prepared to buy the dip? Yes. Here’s why. Buy Ethereum Price Dips – 2025 Is Set to Be A Strong Year A drop back to $3,000 could be a great dip buying opportunity for Ethereum investors willing to tolerate some near-term turbulence in the market. That’s because 2025 could be a historic year for the Ethereum price. The last two years in crypto have been marred by a US SEC intent of killing as much innovation in the crypto space as possible. Sure, they were begrudgingly forced to approve spot Ethereum ETFs earlier this year. But they, alongside the broadly anti-crypto Biden administration, did everything they could to harm the industry. However, US crypto markets are on the cusp of entering into a new golden age, with the pro-crypto Trump administration set to arrive in the White House on the 20th of January, and a new pro-crypto Republican control Congress also to start in a few short weeks. Ethereum is likely to secure new spot ETFs that permit staking in 2025 – these could attract substantially more demand than the existing, zero yielding spot Ethereum ETFs. Ethereum ETFs with Staking: What Could it Mean for Investors and the Network? 1. 0% Management Fee The staking yield on Ethereum is around ~3.2%. Assuming a conservative scenario where issuers stake only 25% of total assets and incur a 20% operating cost (for the staking… pic.twitter.com/pGojnHdjjs — Tom Wan (@tomwanhh) November 7, 2024 Not that these ETFs haven’t been attracting decent demand in recent weeks. Per data presented by The Block , Ethereum ETFs have attracted strong demand nearly every day since Trump’s election victory. Ethereum also retains its commanding lead in terms of DeFi market share. Per DeFi Llama , TVL on Ethereum is over $67 billion, around 56% of the value of total crypto assets locked in smart contracts. Yes, its not the fastest chain, or the cheapest. But its far and away the most trusted DeFi chain, which likely explains why BlackRock has chosen to focus on it, launching its first on-chain money market fund there in 2024 . BUIDL has already amassed nearly $500 million in assets, per DeFi Llama , with further rapid expansion likely in 2025. All of the above talking points suggest that 2025 is likely to be a very strong year for ETH, and that it is likely to retain its leadership position in the altcoin market. Wen ATHs? So, if investors should buy the dip in anticipation of a rally, when can they expect the good times to arrive? Or, more specifically, wen all-time highs? Well, Ethereum’s historic relationship to Bitcoin suggests they might not need to wait long. Bitcoin entered a new phase of price discovery in November, almost perfectly as its traditional cycle around the BTC halving would anticipate. In past cycles, Ethereum has tended to lag bullish Bitcoin price breakouts by up to two months. Meanwhile, January has also historically been a strong month for ETH. So the stars could be aligning for a rapid pushback to record highs for the Ethereum price. Once the Ethereum price snaps above its 2021 highs in the $4,800 area, it’s off to the races. In its 2021 bull cycle, ETH rallied slightly beyond the 4.236 Fibonacci extension from its 2020 lows back to its prior 2017 highs. If it can repeat this feat in 2025/2026, that would imply an Ethereum price of nearly $18,000, over 6x up from current levels. That may seem unrealistic. But if the US does kick off a global race to accumulate Bitcoin by announcing a strategic Bitcoin reserve next year, that could result in fairly quick 5-6x gains for BTC. BREAKING: Trump’s Ally Senator Lummis Pushes to Sell Some of the Fed’s Gold to Buy Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/pRtcEvKfYz — Swan (@Swan) November 15, 2024 Investors would then also likely want exposure to the top smart-contract-enabled DeFi chain in the space, with Ethereum likely to be their first pick. Crypto is full of surprises. Assets can fall much further, much faster than most investors expect in a bear market. But by the same token, assets can rip much higher, much faster than many expect during a bull.

This time frame has illustrated the unrealized growth potential within the crypto space and the exponential returns that the early adopters enjoyed also cemented ETH's place as a fundamental component of the blockchain landscape. Similarly, a renowned ETH bull believes that RXS, at its current price, maybe starting on such a growth path. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Ethereum Parallel Rexas Finance is distinct in its tokenizing focus, carving the emerging markets strategy out of real estate commodities. This alleviates previous access to relatively illiquid assets and optimizes market liquidity and investor base. The real estate market, which stands at approximately $379.7 trillion alone, is an enormous global market that can be targeted for disruption with the Rexas tokenization of assets. Rexas Finance serves numerous tokens, starting from ERC-20 to ERC-721 and ERC-1155, which cater to various token needs, such as utility tokens and even NFTs. Such versatility in the processes helps promote the incorporation of Rexas Finance in a multitude of industries. Presale Performance and Investor Confidence Since its launch in September 2024, RXS has made remarkable advancements. Its presale was a resounding success, as evidenced by the startling rise in the token's price from $0.03 in stage one to a lightning-fast $0.15 in stage ten. As of today, an impressive $32.5 million has been raised, thanks to the total sales of over 375,954,089 RXS tokens. Such strong performance substantiates the confidence of investors and an emerging active community supporting the project. Furthermore, strategic alliances and further listings add to RXS's wholesome potential. In early 2025, RXS tokens are expected to be listed on tier-one cryptocurrency exchanges, which will aid accessibility and, in turn, encourage sales. Such listings boost excitement and visibility, thus enabling Rexas Finance to become a futuristic, best-performing blockchain. Encouraging strong community involvement is yet another pillar for Rexas Finance. A good example comes from the $1 million RXS giveaway to the top 20 lucky winners. As such, Rexas Finance fosters a loyal and engaged user base, contributing to the project's long-term success. Overall, this shift in focus creates excitement and encourages community members to take part and helps build a thriving ecosystem around the RXS token. Analyst Projections: A Bold Forecast According to analysts, RXS will be worth $73 by 2025, an astronomical 48,566% increase. This optimistic prediction is based on RXS's ability to adopt emerging and innovative technologies, strategic partnerships, security, and the expansion of the asset tokenization market. RXS: A Better Option Than Ethereum Ethereum has played a key role in developing smart contracts and decentralized applications. Still, challenges like scalability, high transaction fees, and network congestion exist. The Rexas Finance platform alleviates these issues by seeking to tokenize assets at a lower cost and faster rate. RXS, for instance, has an advantage over ETH in that it seeks to focus on the tokenization of real assets, which is still lacking in the Ethereum ecosystem. This approach makes Rexas Finance more oriented towards the sector of asset tokenization, which is more straightforward to understand for the average investor and user. Also, it should be noted that the RXS presale and even price growth corroborate the market's demand and trust in this asset. For example, the Ethereum network faced such doubts in its early stages and needed time to win the trust of the cryptocurrency community, ensuring gradual growth. Conclusion Rexas Finance (RXS) offers an exciting prospect for everyone who wants to invest in new applications of blockchain technologies. Their goal of tokenizing real-world assets targets them at the heart of an ever-evolving and global economic revolution. As the view grows that the cryptocurrency world is still maturing and has many possibilities, the time to invest is now. Join the moving train and make a financial turnaround with RXS today.

38193183,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376485,1735323458,Bitcoin Kimchi Premium Surges as South Korea Grapples with Political Turmoil,"The ongoing political turmoil in South Korea has had a ripple effect on the country’s financial market. The South Korean won has dropped to its lowest value against the United States dollar since March 2009. This devaluation is reflected in the Bitcoin Kimchi Premium, a metric showing the gap between BTC’s price in South Korea and other countries. On-chain data from CryptoQuant reveals that local investors spend as much as 3% more to buy BTC than global crypto users. South Korean Political Troubles Jeff Park, the Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise, shared insights into the present political troubles in South Korea. He explained that the country’s lawmakers recently filed a motion to impeach the Prime Minister and interim president, Han Duck-soo. This comes just two weeks after the parliament impeached President Yoon Suk-yeol, who has ruled the Asian nation since May 2022. The president’s ousting came after he tried to implement martial law in the country to protect it from “anti-state” forces. Enforcing martial law involves conferring authority from civilians to the military. This rule suspends the civil right to freedom of the press and assembly and downsizes the power of government agencies and the courts. Highlighting how the ongoing political turmoil concerns global democracies, the Bitwise executive wrote: “The use of impeachment as a political tool, combined with allegations of foreign election interference, underscores the fragility of democracy in the face of disinformation. This is not just a Korean story; it’s a warning for democracies worldwide.” Impact on Bitcoin Kimchi Premium News about South Korea’s acting president’s impeachment triggered the won’s drastic devaluation. Crypto asset prices are usually higher on South Korean exchanges than on foreign trading platforms, primarily because of the country’s regulators’ stringent capital control policies. At the time of writing, BTC was 144,450,000 won ($98,000) on the South Korean exchange Upbit, compared with $95,100 on the American exchange Coinbase. Past reports show that an increase in the Bitcoin Kimchi Premium often indicates a bullish streak on South Korean crypto exchanges. Despite the increased price gap, local investors have rapidly flocked to dollar-denominated assets like BTC as a haven from the struggling won.

This metric, tracking the price gap between Bitcoin on South Korea’s Upbit exchange and Coinbase, has jumped to 3-5%, according to data from CryptoQuant. This means one thing: South Korean investors are pouring into Bitcoin like it’s their last lifeline. And why wouldn’t they? The country is a boiling pot of political chaos, economic anxiety, and financial uncertainty. South Korea’s troubles are stacking up. President Yoon Suk Yeol pulled the country into a tailspin earlier this month with a disastrous martial law declaration that lasted just six hours. By mid-December, the National Assembly impeached him. Then came another shock—acting President Han Duck-soo was booted out by parliament, making history as the first acting leader to face impeachment. While politicians play musical chairs, the South Korean won isn’t holding up—it’s down 0.35% against the U.S. dollar. South Korean investors flock to Bitcoin amid turmoil Crypto fever is nothing new in South Korea, but the current one is quite different. The Kimchi Premium, named after the iconic Korean side dish, has always been a telltale sign of retail investor demand. Right now, it’s screaming demand. According to Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, the country’s economic problems are driving wealth outflows like never before. “Inflation fears are making people convert their won into U.S. dollars, Bitcoin, and gold,” Ju said. And here’s the thing, most of South Korea’s crypto activity comes from individual investors because corporate accounts are banned on local exchanges. But this isn’t just about people ditching banks for crypto exchanges. It’s also about South Korea’s strict currency controls and anti-money laundering rules, which push up premiums. Local exchanges often see trading volumes higher than stock markets. Stablecoins like Tether’s USDT are also part of the story. Tether’s premium has climbed alongside Bitcoin’s. The $200k Bitcoin forecast While South Korea is a hotbed for Bitcoin activity, the bull run is global. Analysts are predicting that Bitcoin could hit $200,000 by the second quarter of 2025. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan said, “The record-setting flows into bitcoin ETFs sent bitcoin to new all-time highs in 2024. We don’t see that slowing down any time soon. Combine that demand with the reduction in new supply thanks to the April 2024 halving, plus new buying from corporations and governments.” Then there’s the Trump factor. The president’s promise of regulatory clarity is music to the ears of institutional investors. Analysts believe the new administration will focus on crypto legislation, including market structures and stablecoins, potentially reshaping the industry. “The election was a huge breakthrough,” said Zach Pandl of Grayscale Investments. “The regulatory environment for crypto is about to change dramatically.” But it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. The Federal Reserve’s recent signals about fewer interest rate cuts in 2025 have tempered some of the enthusiasm. Still, many believe the incoming administration’s support will outweigh these macroeconomic headwinds. Ethereum is getting there too Bitcoin might be the star, but it’s not the only one getting attention. Ethereum is getting ready for a major comeback, and institutions are taking notice. Juan Leon of Bitwise called Ethereum “the king of tokenization,” pointing to its dominance in bringing real-world assets onto blockchains. With its long track record and regulatory clarity, Ethereum is becoming a go-to for Wall Street. Pandl thinks Ethereum will be the bridge between traditional finance and crypto. “What you’re going to see next year is more traditional finance integration with Ethereum,” he said. And it doesn’t stop there. A pro-crypto administration would likely start a stablecoin boom, with Ethereum sitting at the center of it all. Meanwhile, Coinbase is eyeing a major milestone: inclusion in the S&P 500. If that happens in 2025, it would contribute to the $200k surge.

XRP Demonstrates Stability Amid Regulatory Hurdles Despite recent difficulties stemming from ongoing legal issues with the SEC, XRP is showing signs of recovery, now trading around $3.28. Having rebounded from a low of $2.29, XRP is approaching the critical $3.0 resistance level, historically a challenging barrier to break. The token's persistence above the $2.6 support line has bolstered investor confidence in its resilience and stability. This gradual recovery indicates an increasing belief in XRP’s potential, despite ongoing regulatory pressures. The token’s ability to maintain crucial support levels suggests it might soon gather sufficient strength to surpass existing resistance barriers. Toncoin’s Strategic Vision Propels Growth in Decentralized Messaging Toncoin is advancing in the domain of decentralized messaging, navigating through various challenges to build a distinctive ecosystem. Despite fluctuations in associated token prices, Toncoin maintains a strong presence in decentralized communications, particularly through its strategic partnership with Telegram.

Web3Bay: Charting the Course for Decentralized Online Retail Web3Bay is transforming online shopping with a decentralized platform designed for safe, open transactions. Central to this platform is the 3BAY token, which offers users valuable benefits like utility, rewards, and the right to participate in governance. Of the total 5 billion tokens, 40% (2 billion tokens) are being offered in the presale, which is organized into 28 phases. Each phase sees a 15% increase in the token price, fostering consistent growth for early investors. Web3Bay ensures a secure and seamless user experience by integrating with well-known wallets such as MetaMask and Trust Wallet and utilizing the IPFS for reliable file storage. Smart contracts streamline the platform's operations by cutting out middlemen, thereby increasing transaction trustworthiness. To support its ongoing expansion, Web3Bay is looking to adopt Layer-2 solutions like rollups, which will reduce costs and enhance transaction speeds. Web3Bay is working towards becoming a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), enabling the community to engage directly in governance. This will allow token holders to propose and vote on important decisions, ensuring the platform remains responsive to its users' needs. By focusing on innovative solutions, Web3Bay, currently in its first presale phase priced at $0.003, is pioneering a new era for decentralized e-commerce, providing secure, efficient, and affordable transaction options. Final Overview Web3Bay, in conjunction with XRP and Toncoin, demonstrates the significant potential of blockchain technology to revolutionize key sectors. With its 3BAY token, Web3Bay is establishing new benchmarks in decentralized e-commerce through secure, community-led transactions, governance participation, and user rewards. Moving towards full interoperability with major blockchain networks and evolving into a community-governed DAO, Web3Bay is setting the groundwork for a user-centric digital marketplace.

Raydium Leads Among Single-Chain DEXs Solana’s performance highlights its growing appeal in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. The surge in activity on Solana-based DEXs like Raydium , Orca, and Lifinity indicates that users and projects are prioritizing the blockchain’s efficiency and scalability. Raydium and Orca recorded $59.642 billion and $23.252 billion, respectively, in the last 30 days. In comparison, Uniswap and PancakeSwap processed higher volumes, reaching $110.219 billion and $95.18 billion, respectively.

Despite this recovery, bearish sentiment continues to weigh heavily on altcoins, and Chainlink is no exception. The cryptocurrency has struggled to reclaim its local highs, raising questions about whether the recent rally has enough momentum to sustain further gains.

If this pattern is confirmed, LINK could face a significant decline, potentially dropping as low as $14 in the coming weeks. This technical setup puts Chainlink at a crucial juncture, where holding above current levels is vital to avoid deeper corrections. Investors and traders closely monitor the price action, with $23 as a key resistance level. Whether LINK can overcome the bearish sentiment or succumb to further downside will likely depend on broader market conditions and its ability to invalidate the bearish pattern.

Such a move would represent a significant downside from current levels and underline the challenges LINK faces in reclaiming its former highs. However, not all hope is lost. Martinez notes that holding above the $22 mark could provide a strong foothold for Chainlink to stabilize and potentially reverse the bearish trend. A decisive push above $27 would further strengthen bullish momentum, signaling a potential return to a more optimistic outlook.

Broader market conditions, including Bitcoin’s performance, will likely influence LINK’s direction. If LINK can successfully navigate these key levels, it may overcome the bearish narrative and position itself for a more sustained rally. Until then, caution remains warranted for traders and investors alike. LINK Testing Liquidity Chainlink (LINK) is currently trading at $23 after successfully testing demand at the $22 level. Despite holding this crucial support, the price action lacks a definitive direction, leaving traders and investors in a state of uncertainty. Bears appear to maintain control for now, with the recent retrace from yearly highs weighing heavily on sentiment. However, the $22 mark has proven to be a resilient support, suggesting that demand could surge at any moment to reclaim the uptrend. For LINK to break free from this indecisive phase, it must overcome the critical resistance at $26. A push above this level would invalidate the current bearish outlook and likely ignite a massive rally, with potential to revisit and surpass previous highs. Such a move would restore confidence among traders and could attract new buyers to fuel further momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Forming A Symmetrical Triangle – Can BTC Reclaim $100K? On the downside, failing to hold above $22 would expose LINK to increased selling pressure, which could test lower support levels and prolong the bearish trend. For now, the market remains at a tipping point, with both bulls and bears waiting for the next decisive move. The coming days will be critical for LINK as it seeks to find direction amid broader market uncertainty.

An on-chain temperature check to advance Aave v3 deployment on the newly launched Sonic layer-1 network reached a quorum on Dec. 27, per a snapshot vote. The check sought to assess community support for integrating Aave, the largest decentralized finance lending protocol, with Sonic’s blockchain. Aave Chain, a major delegate at the AaveDAO, submitted the proposal, which will proceed to the Aave Request for Comment stage, allowing feedback from governance members and service providers.

To read full editions, subscribe . Pendle Pendle exists because crypto wants to speculate. In Pendle’s short history, the team has constantly reiterated its yield trading product using narratives from stablecoins and infamous “DeFi 2.0” ( Olympus DAO ) in the 2021 bull, to liquid staking tokens, real-world assets on Arbitrum, and liquid restaking during the prolonged bear. It wasn’t until the points meta blew up in early 2024 that Pendle struck gold, with its TVL shooting up from the multi-million to multi-billion dollar range. Pendle’s Principle Tokens (PT) and Yield Token (YT) yield mechanisms remain an indispensable tool for anyone looking to perform any form of leveraged points or fixed yield farms. Fluid Fluid is a picture-perfect example of what innovation looks like. Fluid took many of DeFi’s successful primitives, such as Uniswap v3’s concentrated liquidity and Aave’s utilization rate curves, then redesigned traditional AMM liquidity provisioning from the ground up. With its “smart debt” and “smart collateral” mechanisms, Fluid enables deep multi-million dollar DEX liquidity pools that are, technically speaking, $0 in TVL. This capital efficiency was an ingenious combination of users’ debt from lending protocols and AMM liquidity pools. Ethena Stablecoins are some of the hardest sectors to compete in. That makes USDe’s $6 billion market cap achievement very impressive — all within the span of a year. Previous stablecoins built along the spectrum of centralization ( USDT ) vs. scalability ( DAI ). Ethena instead put together a series of impressive business development deals with CEXs and designed USDe, a scalable stablecoin that exploited the arbitrage in CEX-DEX perps funding rates and delivered yield to users. GEODNET For GPS technology to work well at centimeter-level accuracy, traditional companies deploy thousands of real-time kinematic (RTK) networks, like base stations and mobile rovers, globally. Using crypto token incentives, GEODNET sought to scale the deployment of RTK networks. Based on November data, GEODNET has already deployed at least 10,000 stations across 140 countries, surpassing the 5,000 stations put together from traditional providers Trimble and Hexagon. Notably, GEODNET has found a significant cost advantage. Deploying a base station with GEODNET is about $700, or 97% cheaper than legacy costs of $25,000. If that’s not innovation, I don’t know what is. For more, see Blockworks Research’s free report on GEODNET. Virtuals Virtuals is the premier “picks and shovel” play of the recent AI agent frenzy . It’s an AI agent factory that lets anyone spawn a tokenized AI agent. Similar to pump.fun, the agent’s native token is bonded to a DEX liquidity pool (Uniswap v2) once the criteria of a $420k market cap is met. Built on Base, Virtuals has spawned at least 12,000 AI agents since its inception, including the wildly popular anime bot Luna , which runs 24/7 and can be tipped with the agent’s respective token. Virtual’s innovation comes from a combination of many different pieces including LLM models, crypto wallets, innovative value accretive tokenomics, NFTs and IPFS for data storage.

38192650,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634046,1735322075,Global crypto mining faces tax declines in emerging markets despite renewed growth,"The world’s crypto mining tax has strongly declined, with countries known to receive budget boosts, such as Kyrgyzstan, left in dismay. The decline in mining tax presents a sharp contrast as crypto mining saw a renewed growth in activities globally due to technology growth and the rise in digital asset adoption. Global economies are out to harvest from cryptocurrency after admitting that the digital asset is here and that it’s not a cliche. As emerging economies set up infrastructure towards taxing crypto, they are likely to increase their sources of revenue. Kyrgyzstan’s crypto tax revenue dropped due to market and regulatory issues Kyrgyzstan is a developing country known for its abundant renewable energy, but it has seen a huge drop in tax revenue from crypto mining. According to its Ministry of Finance, the country received up to 46.6 million som ($535,000) from crypto mining taxes in the first 11 months of 2024. The drop is significant, accounting for almost 50% of the crypto mining tax revenue in 2025 when it was 93.7 million som (just over $1 million). Kyrgyzstan has been charging a mining tax rate of around 10% on energy fees for crypto mining, which includes value-added tax and sales tax. Kyrgyzstan’s energy sector is very attractive, yet crypto miners have yet to fully utilize it. Thirty percent of the country’s electric supply comes from hydroelectric power, yet only 10 percent has been developed. Although the structural development in Kyrgyzstan’s power supply may be a reason for the drop in tax revenue, regulatory uncertainties, the volatile nature of crypto markets, and miners migrating to a more comfortable environment may not be ignored. Global patterns are driving the crypto mining tax down Although data on crypto mining taxes is limited in most emerging economies, the trends are not far from the ones observed in Kyrgyzstan. Issues of regulation and economic pressure often affect mining operations, ultimately affecting the national tax revenue. Research by the International Monetary Fund showed great risks regarding capital gains tax revenue from crypto. There is a likelihood of missing out on billions of dollars in crypto taxes globally. The report further highlights a higher risk in value-added and sales taxes in countries without proper tax-collecting mechanisms for crypto transactions. Despite the trends, more nations are finding ways to integrate crypto mining into their strategies for sustained energy solutions. For example, Deutsche Telekom in Germany has launched a pilot program using surplus renewable energy to fuel Bitcoin mining operations.

The cryptocurrency whale that participated in Ethereum’s initial coin offering (ICO) woke up after 9.4 years of sleep and transferred 631.1 ETH worth $2.14 million to the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. It is noteworthy that the whale’s move came amid a slight recovery in the ETH price. Interestingly, this crypto whale obtained 1,940 ETH from Ethereum’s Genesis block in July 2015. At the time, this whale paid only $601 for this ETH stash. Related News: Economists Predicted What the FED Will Do in 2025 - What About Interest Rate Cuts?

Table of Contents XYZVerse: A rising contender poised for 2025 gains Solana Dogecoin Conclusion significant future gains. Cryptocurrencies like Solana, Dogecoin, and XYZVerse are attracting attention as potential leaders in the next surge. With eyes on 2025, the question arises: what might propel these digital assets to new heights, and how might investors position themselves ahead of the curve? You might also like: Dogecoin millionaire reveals why XYZVerse at $0.001333 mirrors DOGE’s 2021 rise XYZVerse: A rising contender poised for 2025 gains The current lull in the cryptocurrency market is setting the stage for a future surge, and XYZVerse is emerging as a key player alongside well-known names like Solana and Dogecoin . With its unique approach as the first all-sports meme token, XYZVerse is capturing the attention of investors looking to position themselves ahead of the next big wave. A fresh opportunity in meme coins As the flagship token of the XYZVerse ecosystem, XYZ is redefining the meme coin space. By blending sports fandom with blockchain technology and meme culture, it’s creating a unique niche that could drive significant growth. This unique focus has already set XYZ apart, positioning it as a potential standout in the 2025 market rally. Currently, XYZ is in its ninth presale stage, priced at $0.001333. Early investors have already seen promising returns, with projections pointing to a final presale price of $0.1 by the fifteenth stage — a massive 7,402% increase from its initial price of $0.0001. These numbers highlight the opportunity for those who get in early. The formula for long-term success XYZVerse leverages the growing popularity of prediction markets and GameFi. Platforms like Polymarket have proven the potential of this space, achieving $1 billion in trading volume during major events. XYZVerse is poised to go further, offering a vibrant ecosystem powered by meme coin energy and widespread sports enthusiasm. With plans for listings on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, robust tokenomics, and ongoing community engagement, XYZVerse is building a foundation for sustainable growth. Active contributors in the ecosystem will benefit from rewards such as airdropped tokens, ensuring long-term engagement and a thriving community. Looking ahead to 2025 As Solana and Dogecoin work to consolidate their positions, XYZVerse is steadily gaining momentum. The delayed bull market provides an opportunity to invest in projects like XYZVerse that are preparing to take advantage of the next market surge. For investors eyeing 2025, XYZVerse stands out as a promising contender. Its unique concept, strong growth potential, and focus on community make it a compelling choice for those looking to position themselves for the next crypto bull run. Solana SOL has seen notable price movements recently. Over the past six months, it has risen by 34.50%. However, in the last month, the price has decreased by 19.60%, including an 8.97% drop in the past week. Currently, SOL is trading between $160.72 and $214.47, reflecting significant volatility. Technical indicators point to potential market trends. SOL is below both its 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages at $189.09 and $190.79, respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 33.48, and the Stochastic oscillator is at 16.54, both suggesting the asset is nearing oversold conditions. The MACD level of -2.081 indicates bearish momentum may continue. Key support and resistance levels are crucial for SOL’s price movement. The nearest support level is at $141.08; if the price falls below this, it could test the second support at $87.33. On the upside, breaking through the nearest resistance at $248.58 may propel the price toward the second resistance level of $302. This would represent a substantial percentage gain from current levels. Based on this data, SOL’s price could rise if it surpasses resistance levels or fall further if it breaks below support levels. Dogecoin Over the past week, Dogecoin has fallen by 12.79%, extending a month-long drop of 20.41%. Despite this downward trend, the meme-based cryptocurrency boasts a six-month gain of 153.49%. This contrast highlights its volatile nature, offering significant returns over the long term even amid short-term losses. Technical indicators suggest Dogecoin might be oversold. The Relative Strength Index is at 28.36, and the Stochastic oscillator stands at 16.03 — both below typical oversold thresholds. Additionally, the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are converging at $0.32, indicating potential price stabilization or a reversal. Looking ahead, Dogecoin faces resistance at $0.48 and stronger resistance at $0.63. Breaking through these levels could signal substantial upside, potentially leading to double-digit percentage gains. On the downside, support lies at $0.18, with a deeper support level at $0.0257. If prices slip below these points, further declines may follow. Traders are watching these key levels to gauge Dogecoin’s next move. Conclusion While SOL and DOGE hold potential in the bull market, XYZVerse stands out as a pioneering sports meme coin aiming for significant growth and uniting fans worldwide.

38192268,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634078,1735320896,OKX to delist XRP and LTC expiry futures – What’s the catch?,"Despite the recent bull rallies by both coins, OKX appears to have maintained its stance, as previously stated in June of this year. Ripple’s XRP and Litecoin (LTC) USDT-margined and crypto-margined expiry futures will be delisted by the crypto exchange today. OKX announced , “ In alignment with current market trends and to better meet users’ needs We will officially delist XRP and LTC expiry futures at 8:00 am UTC on December 27, 2024.” They gave further instructions that bi-weekly expiry futures will cease to be generated from June 21, 2024. Also, bi-quarterly expiry futures will cease to be generated from September 27, 2024. However, current listed expiry futures will remain unaffected until their respective expiration dates. OKX explained that the decision to delist these futures contracts came as part of the crypto exchange’s ongoing efforts to adapt to the evolving market landscape and user preferences. It explained that the goal is to streamline the available options for the future. Also, OKX aims to provide a more focused and user-friendly trading experience. Here is what to expect. The prices of XRP and LTC may fluctuate. This could be as a result of traders’ responses to the changes. Investors must monitor market sentiments and trading volumes for any potential shifts in direction. However, analysts believe that the next bull market wave will see additional gains. XRP and LTC price responses The price of XRP has decreased by 1.1% today and by 1.1% in the past week, and it is currently trading at approximately $2.14. $2.13 and $2.23 are the minimum and high prices for the 24-hour period, respectively. XRP price in 7 days Source: CoinMarketCap Additionally, the trading volume has been in decline this week, with a 47% increase in the past month, suggesting a decrease in traders’ interest. However, analysts have observed the price movements of Ripple’s native coin, XRP, have exhibited similarities to its historical chart patterns from 2014 to 2017. A positive news release and a breakout could push the XRP price beyond the $20 mark. In the meantime, the price of Litecoin is also fluctuating in a downward fashion, hovering around $100. Following a more than 4% increase this week, the price was exchanged at $104.05. The low and high of the 24-hour period are $100.51 and $106.03, respectively. The total open interest in LTC futures decreased by 1% in the past 24 hours. The current value of the 4.38 million LTC futures OI is $457.26 million, which indicates that trading activity is cautious. What happens when a coin gets delisted Once a coin is delisted, trading on that exchange stops immediately. This means that all current open orders for the coin will be instantly canceled. Also, generally, customers can still withdraw their holdings to an external wallet after the delisting. However, exchanges frequently impose a deadline for such withdrawals, demanding immediate action from customers to protect their holdings. In addition, delisting often causes a significant loss in liquidity for the impacted coin. This can complicate the process of purchasing or selling the asset on other platforms, as there may be fewer traders eager to trade. The price of a delisted crypto frequently undergoes substantial volatility. This means it typically experiences an abrupt decline as investors quickly liquidate their positions. This is primarily attributable to the coin’s diminished accessibility and the subsequent decline in investor confidence. However, for those who remain optimistic about the project’s long-term viability, it may still be feasible to trade the coin on other exchanges that continue to list it or on decentralized exchanges. Given these potential negative consequences, investors must remain informed about any announcements regarding their holdings and act promptly if there are indications that a cryptocurrency may be at risk of delisting. Despite the risks, delisting can offer purchasing opportunities during frenzied selling. Investors can identify coins that are undervalued post-delisting and have the potential to recover or be relisted. For example, panic selling frequently results in prices falling below their intrinsic value, which presents an opportunity for smart investors to acquire assets at a reduced price. Furthermore, there is a possibility that certain projects may be relisted on other exchanges. In this case, XRP and LTC are still doing well and are expected to continue doing so. This is still a great opportunity to invest.

38192670,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106768,1735320636,5 Hidden Dangers of Cryptocurrency Exchanges: Lessons From Bankruptcies And Hacks You Can’t Ignore,"Learning from your mistakes is valuable, especially when it comes to crypto payment gateways without KYC and the broader crypto market, which, as known, doesn't forgive errors. We've gathered some non-obvious facts about cryptocurrency exchanges, payment platforms, and trading systems that led to the loss of thousands of bitcoins and millions of dollars. These mistakes definitely offer something to learn from. Disclaimer: Dangerous, do not try at home. Your Money is Not Really Yours Do you have a seed phrase for your exchange account? No? Then you don’t actually own your assets. What can happen? Let’s look at the story of the Canadian cryptocurrency exchange, QuadrigaCX. By December 2018, the exchange had 363,000 registered users, 115,000 of whom held assets worth a total of $190 million. On December 9, 2018, the founder of the platform, Gerald Cotten, suddenly and unexpectedly passed away from complications related to Crohn’s disease in an Indian hospital. The tragic irony is that Gerald took with him the access to most of QuadrigaCX’s cold wallets. The company declared bankruptcy, and all customer accounts were frozen. People lost access to their funds forever. How Could This Have Been Avoided? For long-term storage, use hot or cold wallets to which you have the seed phrase. Even if the wallet stops working, you can recover access using the mnemonic phrase.Exchange Servers Can Be Seized A cryptocurrency exchange client has no ability to install software on their own server. If the servers are seized by third parties, all information about cryptocurrency transfers and receipts will fall into their hands. This is exactly what happened in Germany in September 2024. Authorities seized equipment that was being used by 47 cryptocurrency exchanges, which claimed to be anonymous and untouchable. Naturally, all client data — IP addresses, account details, and transaction histories — ended up in the hands of law enforcement. When users attempted to access their usual exchange platforms, they were met with a threatening message stating that their last transaction had been recorded and they should expect an offline meeting with the police soon.How to Maintain Privacy in Blockchain Transactions?To truly control your cryptocurrency and sensitive information, use non-custodial solutions where the software is installed on your server. This ensures that no one has access to your data.The Risk of AML Asset Freezes Do you know how ""clean"" the cryptocurrency in your wallet is? If you’ve never checked your coins for risk levels, any transaction could be your last. If an AML (Anti-Money Laundering) check flags a high-risk level, the exchange has the right to freeze your account and demand proof of the funds’ legality. Dealing with customer support can take weeks, and accounts are not always recoverable.How to Protect Your Assets from AML Freezes?Check the risk level of your cryptocurrency using specialized services like Crystal Blockchain. Request the address from which you are to receive cryptocurrency and verify it. If the check reveals high-risk assets, ask the sender to transfer other coins. Don’t want to use a third-party service? Some wallets, like BitHide, allow for automatic risk assessment of all received cryptocurrencies directly within the wallet.The Threat of Hacks by Fraudsters Exchange balances are often worth billions of dollars, making them a prime target for hackers who work around the clock to find vulnerabilities. Let’s revisit the infamous story of Mt. Gox, one of the largest exchanges of its time. In 2014, Mt. Gox handled 70% of all Bitcoin transactions globally. During a severe cyberattack, hackers managed to steal 850,000 bitcoins. The company collapsed shortly afterward, declaring bankruptcy. What happened to users’ funds? Regulators intervened, and the exchange returned 200,000 bitcoins, but most users permanently lost their assets. How to Safeguard Your Crypto?The advice remains the same: never store significant sums on exchanges. Many wallets offer integrated swap features that allow you to buy or sell cryptocurrency without needing an exchange account. This way, you can avoid using exchanges altogether. Exchanges Are Run by Humans With access to vast amounts of client funds, it’s hard to resist the temptation of making high-risk investments for personal gain. Take the case of FTX as an example. The exchange essentially lent client assets to its affiliate company, Alameda Research. The beginning of the end came when Coindesk published an exposé revealing that 75% of Alameda’s assets — nearly $15 billion — were tied to FTX’s FTT tokens. Investors reacted swiftly, selling $6 billion worth of FTT tokens within days. Unfortunately, those who learned of the scandal too late couldn’t withdraw their funds, as the exchange ran out of liquidity.How to Store Cryptocurrency Securely?Never keep funds where third parties have access. If you don’t want to fund someone else’s risky ventures or their next yacht. Use secure wallets designed to prioritize user control. For personal use, mobile wallets like MetaMask or Exodus are excellent choices. For businesses, opt for wallets with advanced features, such as BitHide. BitHide is a multi-currency crypto bank in your pocket, guaranteeing 100% privacy of business payments in the blockchain. It installs on your server, and only you control the seed phrase. 512-bit encryption keys, two-factor authentication, fingerprint access, automatic backups — the wallet is nearly impossible to hack. Its unique features include multiple IP address changes and proxy payment systems, ensuring your transactions remain untraceable for hackers and competitors. Business users will appreciate the easy API integration, automatic bulk payments, and the ability to separate financial flows into sub-wallets with just a few clicks. Final Thoughts Remember, an exchange is merely a platform. You don’t truly own a single satoshi stored there. All funds are pooled together and can easily disappear into someone else’s pocket, whether through hacks, bankruptcies, or mismanagement. For true ownership and security, use products specifically designed to safeguard your crypto. If you don’t want to become the next cautionary tale, choose reliable wallets with robust protection.",NEGATIVE,FTT,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | FTT,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/27/5-hidden-dangers-of-cryptocurrency-exchanges-lessons-from-bankruptcies-and-hacks-you-cant-ignore/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=5-hidden-dangers-of-cryptocurrency-exchanges-lessons-from-bankruptcies-and-hacks-you-cant-ignore,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

On Dec. 27, the Phoenix team announced that crypto exchange MEXC has listed PHNIX. The move sees the exchange become the first major CEX to add spot trading for the meme coin: “A historic milestone has been achieved on the $XRP Ledger today: $PHNIX is the first XRPL memecoin to be listed on a major CEX!” The PHNIX token launched on December 3, arriving amid fresh interest in meme coins on the XRPL blockchain. PHNIX is a token that looks to symbolize the rise of the phoenix, an outlook the XRP ( XRP ) and Ripple community associates with the blockchain project. Read more: Will XRP price surge in 2025 if the SEC approves Ripple ETF? Before its listing on MEXC, the meme coin was only available on XRPL’s decentralized exchange platform FirstLedger. MEXC has listed the PHNIX/USDT pair, which has seen 6.16 billion tokens worth over $425.63k traded in the past 24 hours. The meme coin’s price surged more than 116% upon the listing. PHNIX has a maximum supply of 589 billion. Rise of XRPL meme coins PHNIX embodies XRP’s recent surge after Ripple weathered the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s legal hurdles. In July 2023, a U.S. judge ruled that XRP is not a security , and in the past two months, the cryptocurrency soared amid bullish expectations. The XRP community sees the PHNIX meme coin as a mascot. Apart from PHNIX, the Ripple blockchain network has a number of top meme coins. These include ARMY, 589, XPILL and RIPPIE. The ARMY token, which has been around for over a year, is among the first meme projects to inspire the XRP community.

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address – 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONPRIN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/prince-elon-elonprin-memecoin-will-explode-over-13000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
38192302,https://thecoinrise.com/cambodia-gives-green-light-to-regulated-crypto-assets/,1735320034,Cambodia Gives Green Light to Regulated Crypto Assets,"It is a new era for digital finance in Cambodia as the country’s national bank has shifted stance on certain classes of crypto assets. According to local news source , the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) has given commercial banks and other payment institutions the green light to provide Category 1 crypto services. The shift in stance followed formalization of a ministerial decision (prakas) issued on Boxing Day and announced by the NBC. A move many have come to term as the country’s “gift” to improving the financial sector. Permissible Crypto Assets in Cambodia Notably, the category 1 crypto assets do not include adoption of Bitcoin , Ethereum or any of such unbacked cryptocurrencies. The green light is only for crypto assets backed by fiat and stablecoins like USDT, USDC and other Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) Following this approval, any commercial bank interested in offering crypto-based services must get clearance from NBC. If authorized to proceed, such commercial banks or payment institutions can then engage in crypto asset exchanges. That is, they can swap fiat currency for crypto assets, provide custodial services for crypto assets and transfer of assets between accounts. This approval comes with a prohibitory clause. The NBC does not allow for the financial institutions to use their customers’ crypto assets for their own benefit. Cambodia’s Shift from Prohibition to Regulation Prior to the decision and NBC’s announcement, citizens of Cambodia were forbidden from engaging in crypto transactions. The Southeast Asian country also prevented any form of trading activities using crypto as the authorities generally considered digital assets too volatile. Additionally, crypto assets were seen as enabling criminal activities including fraud and money laundering in the black market. Thus, the development marks a notable shift towards embracing the cryptocurrency industry. Although Cambodia is still in the early stages of liberalization, market watchers are accepting it as a move in the right direction. The country now joins the global trend gaining traction in the UAE and Hong Kong . Enforcing Regulatory Compliance Cambodia at the beginning of December blocked some crypto exchanges from operation for failure to secure a license. The exchanges included known names like Coinbase, Binance, OKX among others. Notably, only their websites were blocked leaving just the apps. The move became necessary following the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) calls for a crackdown on illicit activities in the Southeast region. Masood Karimipour, UNODC’s regional representative, enjoined governments in the region including Cambodia to curb criminal activities linked to crypto.

38191291,https://crypto.news/?p=14322739,1735319923,"Fantom slips below $1 while Solana’s rival altcoin prepares for a 1,000% upswing","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Fantom faces bearish trends, Solana eyes a $500 surge by 2025, and DTX changes trading with unique asset integration. Fantom faces challenges as analysts point to a bearish wedge pattern, while Solana ‘s stellar rise and potential for hitting $500 in 2025 fuels investor excitement. Meanwhile, the DTX Exchange is changing trading by integrating traditional and crypto assets with unique technology. Let’s take a closer look at these developing trends. Catalysts needed: What could drive Fantom’s next bull run? Recent events have brought attention to the Fantom (FTM) price. The cryptocurrency had a 23% decline in the last week, falling below the $1 level after reaching an annual high of $1.47, suggesting potential vulnerability. In the FTM charts, analysts have seen a rising wedge pattern, which is frequently a sign of impending drops. Despite previous price rallies, Fantom’s high RSI indicates buyer saturation, raising doubts about further higher movement in the absence of strong positive catalysts. The probability of a drop might increase if it doesn’t surpass $1 in the near term. Because of this volatility, people searching for the next great cryptocurrency may be wary of its short-term fluctuations. You might also like: Massive crash wipes $2 billion in Solana longs but DTX Exchange continues to new highs Why Solana’s $500 target isn’t just a dream The price of Solana (SOL) increased significantly in 2024, surpassing $241. The growth of meme currencies on platforms like Pump.fun is mostly to blame for this increase, which has increased Solana’s total value to over $8 billion. With sites like Sol Strategies taking validators and the possibility of Solana ETFs arriving soon, group demand has also increased. According to experts, Solana might reach the $500 mark by Q1 of 2025 if it maintains its current pace and attracts both small and large investors. However, there is also speculation that SOL may see significant declines before reaching this goal. Transforming finance: Why experts are betting big on DTX DTX Exchange (DTX) is an upcoming platform that aims to do something out of the box by multiplying the power of traditional finance with innovative modern technology. It brings together over 12000 tradable assets, including stocks, cryptos, and forex trading assets, under a single roof. Experts are claiming that it will change the trading scene once and for all since it will reduce the biggest hassle of managing multiple platforms for multiple assets. It stands out from the traditional exchanges by offering unique features such as the non-custodial Phoenix Wallet, 1000x leverage option, and the VulcanX hybrid blockchain. Furthermore, with the platform’s no-KYC (Know Your Customer) registration, investors may trade discreetly and easily without disclosing who they are. DTX’s listing on CoinMarketCap has changed the game for this fairly new project, increasing its reputation and legitimacy and bringing greater attention to this Ethereum-based cryptocurrency. The DTX coin is currently available for a mere $0.12 per token in its 6th presale stage. Experts are anticipating an over 1000% upswing in its price upon the platform’s official launch. The presale is selling out quickly, as the 6th stage is already 93% sold out. For more information, visit the DTX Exchange presale website and join the online community.

38191244,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634068,1735319670,OpenAI admits it needs more cash for its for-profit vision,"OpenAI is officially done pretending it can run like a charity. On Friday, the company announced it has finalized plans to transition into a public benefit corporation (PBC) as soon as possible next year, finally ditching the nonprofit structure that’s apparently been holding it back. “The hundreds of billions of dollars that major companies are now investing into AI development show what it will really take for OpenAI to continue pursuing the mission,” its board said. They confidently added that: “Our plan would result in one of the best-resourced non-profits in history. The non-profit’s significant interest in the existing for-profit would take the form of shares in the PBC at a fair valuation determined by independent financial advisors. This will multiply the resources that our donors gave manyfold.” OpenAI is losing money—and fast OpenAI is valued at $157 billion, a jaw-dropping figure for a company that launched ChatGPT only two years ago. The chatbot kicked off a massive generative AI boom, and OpenAI has been riding the wave ever since. But big ambitions come with even bigger bills. This year, the company expects $3.7 billion in revenue. Sounds great, right? Not when you realize they’re also forecasting $5 billion in losses. CNBC confirmed these numbers back in September, and they’ve only gotten worse since. Building and running massive AI models like ChatGPT isn’t cheap. OpenAI leans heavily on Nvidia processors and Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure—tools that don’t come with discount tags. In October, OpenAI closed a $6.6 billion funding round. That money is supposed to help the company hold its ground against competitors like Elon’s xAI, Google, Amazon, and Anthropic. Why? Because the generative AI market is projected to hit $1 trillion in revenue within a decade, and everyone wants a piece of that pie. But here’s the thing: investors don’t just hand over money out of the goodness of their hearts. OpenAI’s nonprofit structure was a problem, and they knew it. By becoming a Delaware-based PBC, OpenAI claims it will issue ordinary shares of stock. This lets them raise money like a traditional company while still keeping a nonprofit arm. That nonprofit wing will handle the warm and fuzzy stuff—think health care, education, and science. But make no mistake: this is about making OpenAI a lean, mean, for-profit machine. Elon Musk isn’t having it Of course, this is OpenAI we’re talking about, so drama is never far behind. Enter Elon Musk. The Tesla and SpaceX billionaire has been feuding with OpenAI for months, and this restructuring plan has only made things worse. Elon has gone as far as suing OpenAI to block the switch, calling it a “total scam” and claiming that “OpenAI is evil.” This isn’t just Twitter-level trash talk. Elon is dragging this fight to court. Why is Elon so mad anyway? Because according to OpenAI, he proposed a similar for-profit structure back in 2017. They claim he was all for it until the idea became inconvenient for him. Elon, predictably, denies this and accuses OpenAI of selling out its original mission. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s leadership isn’t holding back. The board insists this shift is necessary to survive in a market where every competitor has deep pockets and fewer restrictions. The Elon drama doesn’t stop there. He’s been loudly criticizing OpenAI’s focus on shiny, marketable products like ChatGPT. He’s not the only one. Critics inside and outside the company argue that safety and ethics have taken a backseat to profits. Elon’s claims have found some traction among former OpenAI employees too. The talent exodus raises questions Meanwhile, OpenAI’s leadership has had a rough few months. In late September, CTO Mira Murati announced her departure after six and a half years with the company. The same day, two other big names—research chief Bob McGrew and VP Barret Zoph—also walked out the door. A month earlier, co-founder John Schulman left for rival Anthropic. And let’s not forget May, when OpenAI lost two more high-profile figures: co-founder Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike, a former safety leader who also joined Anthropic. So, what’s going on you ask? Well, CEO Sam Altman says it’s all just coincidence. In a September interview, he brushed off concerns, saying the departures were unrelated to the restructuring plan. But not everyone is buying that. Jan Leike actually explained his decision to leave. In a blunt social media post, he said, “Over the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.” Ouch. Another former employee echoed that sentiment, calling out the company for acting like a for-profit while still pretending to be a nonprofit. “You should not believe OpenAI when it promises to do the right thing later,” they said. These departures—and the reasons behind them—highlight the growing tension between OpenAI’s original mission and its current priorities. Back in 2015, when Altman, Elon, and others founded OpenAI, the focus was on research and artificial general intelligence (AGI). It wasn’t supposed to be about profits. That changed in 2019, when OpenAI introduced its capped-profit model, letting the nonprofit control a for-profit wing. Now, even that compromise seems to be falling apart.

As XRP gains attention for its optimistic prospects, Rexas Finance (RXS), a $0.150 altcoin, discreetly positions itself as the next big competitor, aiming to break $10. Rexas Finance attracts investors seeking exponential development with breakthrough real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and a burgeoning ecosystem that seamlessly combines blockchain with physical assets. As both assets increase significantly, an electrifying cryptocurrency showdown is coming. Ripple’s rise to $7.50: 5x increase and altcoin market impact The recent boom in XRP wasn’t a coincidence. Recent news suggests legal clarity in its SEC battle has given XRP hope after years of legal uncertainty. Ripple’s growing network of collaborations with major financial institutions and this newfound hope have restored investor faith in XRP’s potential to change global transactions. Due to this, Ripple’s price has risen, attracting investors seeking high profits. In addition to XRP’s exceptional gain, investors increasingly invest in altcoins as they search beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum for high-growth options. Investors seeking the subsequent big profit are now eyeing smaller, discounted coins as market sentiment shifts toward alternative cryptocurrencies. Rexas Finance is a promising alternative due to its real-world asset tokenization and exponential growth potential. It is ready to follow Ripple’s rise to even greater altcoin riches. Rexas Finance: A revolutionary $0.150 altcoin about to reach $10 Rexas Finance offers more than speculation in the congested cryptocurrency market. With its real-world asset tokenization platform, Rexas Finance is transforming blockchain integration by turning illiquid assets like real estate, art, and commodities into tradable digital tokens. This novel technique tackles the liquidity issue for hard-to-trade assets and establishes Rexas Finance as a pioneer in the blockchain-driven financial ecosystem. RXS’s presale price of $0.15 attracted individual and institutional investors, and demand is expanding exponentially. As the project gets traction and its functionality distinguishes it from speculative coins riding hype, analysts expect RXS’ price to rise 67x or more in the coming months. With its strong utility base, creative vision, and rising demand, Rexas Finance is poised to break $10, giving early investors a unique opportunity to benefit from its potential.

Ethena (ENA) Ethena is bringing a fresh idea to the world of digital currency. Built on Ethereum, it offers a synthetic dollar that doesn’t rely on traditional banks.

Along with this, Ethena introduces the “Internet Bond,” a savings tool that’s accessible to everyone worldwide. It’s a way to save money in dollars and earn interest, all through crypto technology. In today’s market, Ethena’s approach could be very appealing. Many are looking for financial solutions that give more control and aren’t tied to traditional finance.

BONK (BONK) BONK, a memecoin on the Solana blockchain, is making waves with its rapid rise. Featuring a Shiba Inu mascot, BONK seeks to empower the Solana community by redistributing power from venture capital tokens. After its listing on Coinbase, BONK’s price surged over 100%, drawing attention from crypto enthusiasts. It acts as a “community coin,” having airdropped 50% of its supply to Solana’s NFT and DeFi participants. By mid-December 2023, BONK had become the third-largest memecoin by market cap with a year-to-date gain of over 10,000%. Despite challenges like a high total supply and the inherent volatility of memecoins, BONK’s future looks promising. Its integration into the Solana ecosystem, including the launch of BonkSwap, a decentralized exchange, expands its utility. Compared to other memecoins, BONK benefits from Solana’s fast and low-cost transactions. In the current market, where community-driven projects are gaining traction, BONK stands out as an attractive option. While memecoins remain risky, BONK’s active involvement in a growing network of decentralized apps could make it a notable player in the crypto space. Conclusion ENA and BONK offer promising potential, but XYZVerse (XYZ), the first all-sport memecoin, uniquely blends sports and memes, aiming for 20,000% growth and stands out in the bull market.

He has argued that BlackRock, under CEO Larry Fink, promotes “stakeholder capitalism,” which he believes prioritizes social and political agendas over maximizing shareholder value. Ramaswamy, through his firm Strive Asset Management, has advocated for “anti-woke” investing and has opposed the growing influence of ESG factors in business decisions, particularly criticizing companies like BlackRock for pushing such agendas. BTC To Hit $350K In the same post, Kiyosaki expressed his bullish bet on Bitcoin and revealed that he loves to hold Bitcoin in his own wallet, and shared that he would not trust Bitcoin in BlackRock’s ETF. He also argued that BlackRock is suppressing Bitcoin’s price so that large investors can buy it at under $100k. Despite all of this, he remains bullish on Bitcoin and shared with his followers that he will keep buying more Bitcoin as he sees it going higher. He also predicted that it will reach $350,000 in 2025. Bullish Outlook Bitcoin has increased almost 130% this year, breaking record highs on several occasions. The dominant crypto narrative for 2024 has focused on institutional adoption, with increased involvement from major financial institutions and corporations in the cryptocurrency space.

Besides, Bitwise Asset Management has applied for an ETF to track the shares of companies that hold at least 1,000 BTC in treasury. Also, Strive Asset Management, co-founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, filed a second Thursday application for a Bitcoin Bond ETF.

38190774,https://finbold.com/?p=223568,1735318930,AI predicts Shiba Inu (SHIB) price for 2025,"Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) has come a long way from its origins as a meme coin, transforming into the 14th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. While its real-world utility remains limited, SHIB has managed to stay relevant through community-driven initiatives and developments like its layer-two scaling solution, Shibarium, which has recently reached significant milestones. As the token navigates ongoing market volatility and ecosystem growth, investors are increasingly curious about where Shiba Inu might stand by 2025. SHIB seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold At press time, Shiba Inu was trading at $0.00002143, posting a 1.24% gain over the week, while monthly returns slipped to 15%. The token has surged 101% so far this year, highlighting its strong performance despite market fluctuations. ChatGPT projection on Shiba Inu price To gauge Shiba Inu’s future potential, Finbold analyzed market data and consulted ChatGPT-4o for projections. In a bullish scenario, the artificial intelligence tool predicts that SHIB could climb as high as $0.000081, marking a nearly 277% increase from its current price of $0.00002143. Conversely, in a bearish outlook, the AI suggests SHIB could fall to $0.000015, reflecting a potential 30% downside from its current level. ChatGPT SHIB price outlook for 2025. Source: ChatGPT/Finbold Factors driving SHIB’s growth When queried, ChatGPT identified Shibarium as one of the most significant developments for Shiba Inu. This layer-two scaling solution has dramatically improved transaction efficiency, reaching the milestone of 700 million total transactions on December 25, just months after its launch last summer. Furthermore, the network introduced faster block processing and enhanced wallet compatibility, boosting adoption across the crypto community. ChatGPT also highlighted the refined burning mechanism, designed to reduce the token supply, as a key factor that could play a crucial role in supporting Shiba Inu’s long-term value. Additionally, the tool emphasized Shiba Inu’s plans to broaden its market presence and utility. For instance, the development of a stablecoin pegged at $0.01 is expected to expand SHIB’s functionality within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, offering new growth opportunities. Factors driving Shiba Inu’s growth. Source: ChatGPT/Finbold Moreover, ChatGPT pointed to the anticipated launch of the TREAT token as a bullish factor. Designed to serve as the reward token within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, TREAT is set to provide multifaceted utility, further enhancing the project’s appeal. Complementing these developments, on-chain data retrieved by Finbold from IntoTheBlock on December 25 offers valuable insights into Shiba Inu’s investor dynamics. The data reveals that 55% of SHIB holders are currently in profit, 8% are breaking even, and 37% are at a loss. This distribution, as highlighted by ChatGPT, could significantly influence the token’s price trajectory. Profitable holders may seek to capitalize on their gains, potentially increasing selling pressure. Meanwhile, those breaking even or at a loss might choose to hold, anticipating a market recovery. These dynamics highlight the delicate balance of investor sentiment and market performance in shaping Shiba Inu’s future. That being said, the outlook for Shiba Inu leans bullish , supported by technical projections and the ongoing ecosystem growth. Temporary dips in the token’s price could provide traders with valuable opportunities to secure better entry points for long positions , positioning them to capitalize on potential future gains.

Recent Solana price trends show an impressive rise to $199, although current bearish signs, such as an RSI below 40, call for caution. Similarly, the Litecoin price outlook remains steady, with the $99-$109 support zone proving pivotal for its upcoming price directions. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) is taking a significant step with its soon-to-be-released Keynote 3 video in 2025. The project is expected to be led by a famed Hollywood director, aiming to merge filmic artistry with the latest blockchain developments. This major update has attracted a considerable following, boosting its presale to over $172.5 million. Solana’s Recovery Journey: From $9.64 to $199 Solana has seen remarkable growth, advancing from $9.64 to $199, supported by developments related to ETFs, which demonstrate its durability. Nonetheless, it faces obstacles. The RSI indicator for Solana is below 40, signaling potential oversold conditions. Moreover, its Total Value Locked (TVL) has fallen to $7.93 billion, a rapid 10% decline in one day, which brings up doubts regarding its continued momentum. These Solana price trends reveal both opportunities and risks, with the fluctuating market leaving traders unsure if it will reach its previous high of $263. As its ecosystem expands, prudence is crucial due to ongoing bearish indicators. Will Litecoin Surpass the $109 Threshold? Currently, Litecoin’s price is stable within the $99 to $109 range, essential for deciding its future direction. Historical insights indicate that preserving this range is crucial for any bullish trend towards $132 or beyond. However, recent market dynamics have raised concerns. Litecoin has found it challenging to achieve substantial upward movement, and its trading volumes are diminishing, which indicates a declining interest. The Litecoin price outlook reflects a mixed reaction towards the cryptocurrency. Despite a solid historical base, its recent difficulties in maintaining momentum and overcoming resistance levels leave many wondering about its potential to become the next big crypto. Anticipation for BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 Soars with Hollywood Flair BlockDAG’s upcoming Keynote 3 is stirring excitement throughout the cryptocurrency community, fueled by rumors that a renowned Hollywood director is steering the production. Speculation is rife that this event will integrate cutting-edge blockchain technology with cinematic quality, potentially creating a new paradigm for crypto presentations. The excitement is tangible among both cryptocurrency experts and traders as they speculate on what BlockDAG might unveil. Could there be advanced technology on display, new significant partnerships, or a visionary concept that reshapes the future of cryptocurrency? With promises of combining striking visuals with groundbreaking updates, the anticipation for this event is skyrocketing. The cryptocurrency sector is keenly watching BlockDAG as it prepares for what may be a transformative milestone in the evolution of blockchain. The excitement around Keynote 3 has propelled BlockDAG’s crypto presale to remarkable heights, accumulating over $172.5 million by selling more than 17.5 billion BDAG coins and moving rapidly toward a $600 million target. Early supporters have witnessed an extraordinary 2,240% ROI, with the price of BDAG coins increasing from $0.001 to $0.0234 over 26 batches. For those considering getting involved, BDAG coins are currently priced at $0.0234. However, this opportunity is dwindling as the latest batch is nearly sold out. Spotlight on Future Crypto Leaders While Solana price trends have rebounded impressively to $199 amidst ETF-related excitement, and Litecoin price outlook is solidifying within the crucial $99-$109 support zone, uncertainties remain for both. On the contrary, BlockDAG is capturing widespread interest with its much-anticipated Keynote 3 video, slated for release in 2025 and expected to be directed by a famed Hollywood filmmaker. This monumental release is significantly contributing to a presale that has already shattered expectations. Having raised $172.5 million so far, BlockDAG is on a fast track toward its $600 million presale goal, establishing itself as the next big crypto to keep an eye on. As the presale progresses swiftly, now is an opportune moment to engage with BDAG at its current appealing price, before it’s too late.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Remittix, dubbed the “XRP killer,” is poised to disrupt a $190T market and outshine Solana with 200x growth potential. Table of Contents Solana records breakout and retest, set for rally to $400 The XRP killer set to dominate the market in 2025 is Remittix Which is the best crypto to buy, Solana or Remittix? In the crypto world, there is always a new project coming up and seeking a top spot in a very crowded market. The latest altcoin to make headlines, Remittix (RTX) , has been dubbed the “ XRP killer.” Set to reinvent a $190 trillion market, Remittix is one of the top crypto coins experts have their eyes on. The more popular it gets, the bigger the speculation becomes that it could outshine Solana (SOL) in 2025. While analysts expect SOL to rise as high as $400 in 2025, they believe RTX could be the next 200x coin because of its almost unlimited market potential. You might also like: Ethereum whales are accumulating Shiba Inu and Remittix – here’s why Solana records breakout and retest, set for rally to $400 The recent crypto market correction has not been very kind to Solana (SOL) . From an ATH of $263.21 on November 22, the altcoin price plunged to retest the $180 support level. According to CoinMarketCap’s data, the Solana coin has now bounced back up above $190. Captain Faibik, a popular crypto analyst has confirmed that the recent Solana price action is a breakout and retest of the bullish pennant on the weekly chart. Raoul Pal has shared the same prediction, saying it should be the continuation of the uptrend for Solana. According to Captain Faibik, the Solana crypto could rally as high as $400 over the next few weeks if the bullish pattern is confirmed. But if the $180 support level is broken, this price forecast will be at risk.The launch of ETFs can be one strong event that will drive Solana’s price to new all-time highs. The SEC could approve several applications for the Solana Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) next year: Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas has already hinted as much. The XRP killer set to dominate the market in 2025 is Remittix Ripple (XRP) gained fame in the crypto world by facilitating seamless cross-border payments. XRP is no stranger to being a competitor, but Remittix (RTX) is not only an opponent but has newer, better and more advanced features that financial experts believe could be the bridge between fiat and electronic assets. It does more than Ripple which has become famous for fast, low-cost international money transfers. On the Remittix platform, individuals and businesses can accept 50+ cryptocurrency pairs to instantly convert to 30+ fiats. Taking it a notch higher, Remittix has integrations with local banking networks, allowing users to send money to bank accounts across the world and receive it on the same day. Thus, Remittix is not just the “XRP Killer,” its main competition is Stripe, Wise, and Coinbase. All these services are available on a flat fee rate, making Remittix significantly cheaper than all major banks. It also enables businesses interested in offering crypto payments, with the introduction of the Remittix Pay API which allows businesses to receive crypto payments from the customers and settle transactions back into fiat to nominated bank accounts. Looking at all these features, it is easy to see why crypto experts have pegged the RTX coin as the next 200x crypto to buy. Remittix is currently priced at a very attractive $0.0163 while it has raised over $650k in its ongoing cryptocurrency ICO in just a few days. Which is the best crypto to buy, Solana or Remittix? With Remittix on track to redefine a $190 trillion market, it has more upside potential than Solana. In addition, the prediction of SOL rallying to $400 suggests that the altcoin has passed its explosive phase while RTX is just stepping into its own. With forecasts of up to a 100x increase, Remittix could be the best crypto investment heading into 2025. To learn more about Remittix, visit the Remittix presale and join the Remittix community.

38190588,https://crypto.news/?p=14322629,1735318557,Hamster Kombat to debut layer-2 network on TON after failed airdrop,"Hamster Kombat, once a top Telegram game, is turning to blockchain development on TON after struggling with declining popularity. Hamster Kombat , a tap-to-earn game built on Telegram , is showing signs to deepen its blockchain roots, this time launching a layer-2 network on top of The Open Network, or just TON ( TON ). The decision comes after a community vote favouring the development of a dedicated network seemingly designed to enhance the Hamster Kombat token’s HMSTR ( HMSTR ) use cases. https://twitter.com/hamster_kombat/status/1872599258261586321 Table of Contents Layer-2 networks on TON State of Hamster Kombat Unclear roadmap Layer-2 networks on TON Layer-2 networks are built on top of existing blockchains to improve transaction speeds and scalability. While Ethereum already hosts several well-known layer-2 networks, such as Coinbase’s Base or Blast, TON is still in the early stages of exploring similar technologies. As of press time, there are no indications that TON hosts any operational layer-2 network. However, the TON ecosystem seems to be working on compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine protocols. The strategy may be aimed at attracting liquidity and dApp developers from Ethereum to integrate them into TON’s infrastructure. For instance, in July, another project, dubbed TON Applications Chain, announced plans to develop a layer-2 network on TON. However, TAC aims to leverage Polygon’s layer-2 technology to achieve this goal. State of Hamster Kombat The so-called “Hamster Blockchain” comes from a vote within the Hamster DAO. The proposal suggested building a network “where HMSTR token would be used for gas fees,” per the proposal’s description . Hamster Blockchain’s voting details | Source: Hamster DAO The vote met the required quorum of 1 billion HMSTR tokens on Friday, Dec. 27, with more than 1.18 billion HMSTR tokens in favor and just over 104,000 tokens against. However, it seems that over 60% of the total votes cast in favor of the initiative — amounting to approximately 737.3 million HMSTR tokens — were submitted by a single address , identified as UQDz…hUCu. Launched in March, Hamster Kombat rapidly gained popularity, amassing millions of users within five months. According to the Hamster Kombat team, a whopping 300 million people have signed up to play the game. Of these, a little under half of the players — 131 million in total — qualified to receive HMSTR tokens. Meanwhile, over 2.3 million players were flagged as cheaters and excluded from the token distribution. The game’s integration with Telegram received a boost from the messaging app’s founder, Pavel Durov, who praised the game’s launch on TON as a way to bring blockchain benefits to millions. Unclear roadmap However, for Hamster Kombat, things went south pretty quickly following the airdrop of its token, as it failed to meet players’ financial expectations. By early November, the user base had plummeted by 86%, dropping from 300 million to approximately 41 million active monthly players, per data from IntoTheBlock. Several factors may have contributed to this decline: Token performance : The HMSTR token’s value decreased by over 50% shortly after its launch, which may have led to diminished player interest and confidence. As of press time, the HMSTR token is priced at $0.003006, marking a 70% decline from its all-time high, which was reached at the time of the airdrop in late September. The token’s market capitalization, which once exceeded $552 million, is now at $194.57 million, showing a large decline of around 65% in just three months since the airdrop. Competition : New games like Catizen, TapSwap, Paws Mini App, and Blum have joined the tap-to-earn trend, drawing attention away from Hamster Kombat. Community sentiment : As crypto.news reported earlier , the community expressed dissatisfaction with the game’s development and unmet expectations, potentially contributing to the decline in user engagement. In trying to solve these issues, the Hamster Kombat development team appears to be shifting the community’s focus toward the creation of a layer-2 network on TON. Nonetheless, several critical details remain unclear. For example, there’s no information thus far on who will develop the network, what technological stack will be used, or, most importantly, who’s gonna pay for the ambitious plan. The missing details in the initiative’s description leave too many questions unanswered as well. On top of that, the proposed layer-2 network isn’t mentioned in Hamster Kombat’s roadmap at all, which appears to have not been updated since September.

StepN ( GMT ) price surged by 50%, reaching an intraday high of $0.2275, its highest level since December 9. This rebound happened as Bitcoin and other altcoins like Virtuals Protocol , Fartcoin, Hyperliquid, and Raydium soared by double-digits. There was no immediate news that pushed the coin’s price higher. A likely reason for the surge is that the number of StepN’s users rose to 97 , its highest level since Dec. 30. These users remain significantly lower than the highest level last month. StepN cumulated users | Source: Dune StepN’s rally happened a few weeks after the developers expanded a partnership with Adidas, the popular sports apparel company. The two companies agreed to introduce 1,200 limited-edition sneakers available to NFT holders. You might also like: Popcat price forms risky pattern as Solana meme coin loses share https://twitter.com/Stepnofficial/status/1871529761857577166 Another likely reason why the GMT price has soared is the lack of liquidity in the market because of the Christmas holiday. In such periods, it is usually easy to manipulate low-volume cryptocurrencies. StepN also likely soared because of South Korean traders. According to CoinMarketCap , most of the GMT’s volume was in Upbit, which handled over $311 million of volume on Friday, representing a 25% market share. Binance and Bybit followed it, handling $219 million and $27 million, respectively. StepN was one of the most popular players in the crypto industry as it introduced the concept of moving to earn. Users bought sneaker NFTs and were rewarded for doing simple tasks like walking and running. Like other “ to earn ” projects, its success was short-lived as its usage plunged. GMT price analysis GMT chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the GMT price formed a God candle on Friday, soaring to a high of $0.2275. This rally happened after the coin found substantial support along the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since August last year. It is common for assets to go parabolic after hitting a crucial support level. GMT has risen above the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level and the 50-day moving average. It also moved to the top of the trading range of the Murrey Math Lines. Therefore, these gains may be limited because there was no major news that led to its rebound. If this happens, the token will likely retest the strong pivot reverse level at $0.15.

38190666,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634031,1735318320,Terra Luna Founder Do Kwon to be extradited to the United States,"Do Kwon, the mastermind behind the TerraUSD and Luna disaster that obliterated $40 billion in crypto, is finally heading to the United States to face justice. Montenegro’s Minister of Justice, Bojan Božović, signed the extradition order , prioritizing the U.S. request over South Korea’s. This decision comes after Montenegro’s Supreme Court confirmed all legal conditions for extradition were met. The court evaluated criteria such as the gravity of Kwon’s alleged crimes and the sequence of requests, tipping the scales in favor of the U.S. The Ministry of Justice said, “Most of the criteria provided by law support the request for extradition by the competent authorities of the United States,” effectively shutting down South Korea’s hopes of prosecuting Kwon on its own soil. The rise and brutal fall of TerraUSD and Luna Kwon didn’t just create TerraUSD and Luna—he created an empire built on hype, algorithms, and a dangerously flawed financial model. TerraUSD was marketed as a stablecoin that would always be worth $1. But unlike traditional stablecoins backed by tangible assets, TerraUSD relied on its connection to Luna, another crypto. The idea was simple: TerraUSD could be redeemed for $1 worth of Luna, creating an artificial peg. To sweeten the deal, Kwon launched the Anchor Protocol, offering 20% annual returns on TerraUSD deposits. Yes, 20%. For a while, this insane rate attracted investors like bees to honey. Then everything blew up. On May 7, 2022, TerraUSD’s peg slipped to $0.99. Investors panicked, dumping their holdings. In a desperate attempt to fix the situation, Terraform Labs flooded the market with Luna, causing its price to plummet. Luna, once valued at over $100, became worthless within days. Billions in Bitcoin reserves were deployed in vain to stabilize the collapse. The fallout didn’t just take down TerraUSD and Luna—it triggered a domino effect, bankrupting other crypto firms and wiping out $2 trillion in market value. The scale of destruction caught the attention of regulators worldwide. U.S. authorities accused Kwon of misleading investors and hiding wealth. South Korea, where Luna had 280,000 holders, wasn’t far behind. Lawyers there alleged fraud and illegal fundraising, prompting prosecutors to issue an arrest warrant in September 2022. By then, Kwon had vanished from Singapore, forcing Interpol to issue a red notice. A fugitive’s fall Kwon didn’t stay on the run forever. His globe-trotting escapades ended in Podgorica, Montenegro, on March 23, 2023. He and Terraform Labs’ former CFO, Han Chang-joon, were busted trying to board a private jet to Dubai using forged passports. The arrest was almost cinematic—Interpol notices, fake documents, and a last-minute airport capture. Immediately, both the U.S. and South Korea demanded extradition. But first, Montenegro had its own score to settle. Kwon spent four months in a Montenegrin prison for document forgery. After release, he was transferred to a foreign reception center, awaiting the decision that has now landed him in the U.S.’s custody. Han Chang-joon wasn’t as lucky—or maybe he was. In February this year, Montenegro sent him back to South Korea. Terraform Labs hasn’t gone down without a fight. The company dismissed South Korean charges as politically motivated, arguing that Luna doesn’t qualify as a security under the country’s laws. They’ve called the accusations “unfounded,” a word that might not carry much weight when $40 billion of investor money has evaporated.

In 2024, crypto ETFs will take the cryptocurrency world to a new level, and emerging projects can completely transform the DeFi world. While Cardano (ADA) has performed tremendously in the past months, emerging projects are stealing the spotlight with innovation and huge profit potential.

DTX presale has seen a massive capital influx as investors seek promising projects that could be the next bull market leader.

Hydra intends to provide the Cardano ecosystem with impressive transaction speeds of up to 100,000 TPS. Hydra is a layer-2 scaling solution that offers the answers to pain points of faster transactions, lower costs, and stronger security.

After the triangle pattern break, it is currently trading at $0.90. 50-EMA has been a major support for Cardano price, and bulls have successfully sustained it above $0.85. Source: CoinMarketCap While ADA is still below the psychological level of $1, the bearish pressure remains.

DTX Exchange ready to top altcoin charts DTX Exchange is experiencing surging global demand as it integrates unique trading technologies designed to enhance profitability for every kind of trader. Its bullish performance has ranked it the best presale of the year. According to projections, after listing on major exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and Uniswap, the DTX token could reach $25.9 from its current price of $0.12. Exponential growth in the DTX Exchange offers opportunities for a profit potential of 21,000%. Thus, $100 invested at the current level could be worth nearly $21,000.

Ethereum Co-Founder Supports Thai Zoo Vitalik Buterin , the co-founder of Ethereum, has donated 88 ETH—equivalent to 10 million Thai baht—to Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Thailand. This contribution officially makes Buterin the sponsor of Moo Deng, a pygmy hippopotamus and a viral sensation at the zoo. Announcing the donation on December 26, the zoo expressed gratitude through a post on X: “Thank you Vitalik Buterin for joining the Wildlife Sponsorship Program and adopting Moo Deng with a generous gift of 10,000,000 THB for her family! We look forward to working with you over the next 2 years.” Moo Deng: A Viral Star Moo Deng gained widespread recognition in September 2024 for her charismatic social media presence. Videos showcasing her playful personality turned the pygmy hippo into a global phenomenon. Buterin, in his own X post, shared his enthusiasm about sponsoring Moo Deng: ""I'm happy to be adoptive father to Moo Deng as she grows up over the next 2y and support her with my 10M THB donation, maybe more as I set aside 88 ETH for [Moo Deng] + frens.” Motivations Behind the Donation The Ethereum co-founder’s visit to the zoo in November 2024 reinforced his appreciation for its commitment to animal welfare and education. Reflecting on his experience, Buterin acknowledged the warmth of Thailand and its contributions to Ethereum’s success, particularly following events like the Devcon Sea blockchain conference. He stated, “This could not have happened without the warmth and kindness of Thailand and our Thai organisers. What better way to show appreciation than through a Christmas present to someone dear to all Thai people, Moo Deng, who has become an unexpected Thai celebrity on the global stage.” Impact on Memecoin and Crypto Community Moo Deng’s rise to fame also inspired the creation of a Solana-based memecoin, MOODENG. While its creator donated over 10 billion tokens to Buterin, he sold them to direct proceeds toward charitable causes. However, the token's market trajectory highlighted the volatility of memecoin trading. After a peak valuation of $0.62 in mid-November, the token fell by 58%, raising concerns about insider activity. But Buterin’s 88 ETH donation reversed the token’s fortunes. The MOODENG token surged over 70% in 24 hours and recorded a 125% weekly increase following the announcement. This latest initiative aligns with Buterin’s philosophy of leveraging cryptocurrencies for meaningful global contributions. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

38189741,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667654,1735317008,Bitcoin $90K Level Is Crucial For Bulls – Price Could Tag $79K If BTC Loses It,"Bitcoin has found itself in a challenging position, struggling to reclaim the coveted $100,000 mark after a rapid shift in market sentiment. Just weeks ago, optimism dominated the landscape, with prices surging toward new heights. However, the narrative has taken a sharp turn, as fear now grips the market following a sudden correction. Related Reading: ONDO Faces 30% Correction Risk If It Loses $1.46 Support – Top Analyst Currently trading below $100K, Bitcoin’s price action reflects increased uncertainty among investors. Top analyst Axel Adler recently shared his insights on X, emphasizing the significance of the $90,000 level as a robust support zone. According to Adler, this zone extends to a lower range of $79,000, offering a safety net should further declines occur. He highlights that maintaining this support is crucial for Bitcoin to stabilize and regain bullish momentum. While the current sentiment leans toward caution, historical trends suggest that Bitcoin often thrives after testing key support levels. The market’s focus has now shifted to whether BTC can defend this critical zone and stage a recovery. In the coming days, the $90K mark will be a pivotal battleground, determining whether Bitcoin can regain its footing or continue its descent. Investors and analysts alike are closely monitoring these developments, awaiting the next major move. Bitcoin Finding Demand Below $100K Bitcoin’s price action has shifted from testing new all-time highs to finding solid demand below the $100,000 mark. This zone will determine whether the rally resumes or the market confirms a deeper correction. Amid this uncertainty, top analyst Axel Adler has provided critical insights on X, shedding light on key levels shaping Bitcoin’s trajectory. Adler’s analysis highlights the significance of the $79,000 level, which recently recorded the largest unrealized profit and loss (P/L) in the past decade. This data suggests that the $79K zone is not only a psychological benchmark but also a crucial support level with significant market activity. Additionally, he emphasizes the $90K mark as a robust support area, with its lower boundary set at $79K. Adler notes that holding above $90K in the coming weeks would bolster bullish momentum, making a surge past $100K highly probable. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Setting For a Big Move – Breakout Or Downturn? However, Adler also cautions about the potential for a sideways consolidation phase. Such a move could serve as a cooling-off period for the market, allowing it to digest recent gains before resuming its upward trajectory. For now, Bitcoin’s price action remains at a pivotal crossroads, with its ability to maintain support levels dictating whether the next phase will be a breakout or a correction. Investors are watching closely. Technical Analysis: Key Levels To Hold Bitcoin is currently trading at $96,200, reflecting days of indecision and sideways price action that has left traders uncertain about the next move. Despite this consolidation phase, BTC remains within a critical range, with its next direction likely to depend on whether bulls or bears take control. For bullish momentum to return, Bitcoin must break decisively above the psychological $100,000 mark. Achieving this milestone would signal renewed strength and could pave the way for further price discovery, potentially igniting another leg of the rally. On the flip side, holding above the $92,000 level would still maintain a bullish narrative, as it demonstrates resilience at a crucial support zone. However, concerns about a potential downturn persist among analysts. Some experts predict that Bitcoin could drop as low as $70,000 in the coming weeks if the $92K support fails to hold. This bearish scenario would represent a significant correction and could shake market sentiment.

PEPE meme coin hype faces a challenger as Lightchain AI, blending blockchain and AI, attracts holders seeking utility and growth. Table of Contents The limitations of meme coins like PEPE Why PEPE holders are shifting to Lightchain AI Roadmap for Lightchain AI’s success PEPE , the meme coin phenomenon that captured the crypto world’s imagination, has amassed a loyal following thanks to its community-driven hype and viral appeal.

The limitations of meme coins like PEPE PEPE has got some popularity as a playful and risky item, but it doesn’t have the base tech or uses that are needed to keep its worth over time. Its dependence on people’s excitement and market feelings makes it very unstable and limits how much it can grow. Meme coins, like PEPE, hav͏e often found it hard to change from being popular to having working uses. So, more and more people who put in money are looking for projects such as Lightchain AI that mix chances of making money with real-life use. The meme coin spot is full of similar projects and quick rise-and-fall plans, which makes it hard for investors to find real chances for growth. Why PEPE holders are shifting to Lightchain AI There are several reasons why PEPE holders are turning their attention towards Lightchain AI as a more promising investment. Diversification into utility-driven projects PEPE holders recognize the value of diversifying into projects with robust use cases.

The move has led to an impressive 22% rise in Bitget Token’s price in the last 24 hours, pushing it to an all-time high (ATH) of $8.45. In addition, the company revealed that they will burn a whopping $5 billion worth of BGB tokens in a newly unvelied whitepaper. Token Merge Sparks Market Enthusiasm At the time of writing, data from CoinGecko showed that the asset’s value had increased by more than 125% over the past seven days, outperforming the global crypto market, which lost 1.50% of its worth in that period. In addition, it has done better than similar centralized exchange (CEX) tokens, which are up about 12.70% on average. The uptick is even more pronounced across extended periods, with BGB jumping more than 160% in the last fortnight and almost 430% over 30 days. Further, the token’s current price is a massive 1,346.2% improvement over its level from the same time last year, potentially making it the best-performing CEX cryptocurrency of 2024. BGB’s current market capitalization of over $11.7 billion has propelled it into the #19 position among the largest-capped cryptocurrencies, leaping Stellar (XLM), Polkadot (DOT), and Hedera (HBAR). In addition to the merger, the team revealed a considerable burn of more than $5 billion worth of tokens, which surely played a role in the price uptick. This represents over 40% of the total supply of BGB. Utility and Real-World Integration According to Bitget CEO Gary Chen, the merger will grow BGB’s utility, with plans to use it in decentralized applications (dApps) and major blockchain ecosystems. The integration will also reportedly extend to staking in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and to power essential services such as multi-chain gas fee payments. Beyond the blockchain, the exchange intends to position BGB as a key enabler of real-world applications by allowing payments for dining, travel, and shopping, among others, through its Web3 PayFi service. The company has assured BWB holders that their assets will be transitioned to BGB through an automated swap process that will convert each BWB token to BGB at a pre-determined ratio. Any remaining BWB has been earmarked for burning to bolster the unified asset’s scarcity and long-term value.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB.

In an X post on December 27, he said: Donald Trump will propose putting BTC on our balance sheet in a “huge” way. – Grant Cardone Cardone believes Trump will continue to push for Bitcoin Grant Cardone claims that Donald Trump could advocate for Bitcoin to the American public, given that the United States is still competing for global monetary domination. According to Cardone, the president-elect will pitch Bitcoin as necessary to maintain and strengthen the United States’ global leadership position. He even believes Trump’s potential Bitcoin promotion could be similar to the time when former President John F. Kennedy rallied momentum on the moon landing in the 1960s, selling the US as the first to be on the moon. Meanwhile, Cardone’s post on X has invited multiple commentaries, some supporting his opinion while others contrasted or questioned the viability of Bitcoin. Among his supporters is Starbot.pro CEO Noah Kaufman, who simply responded , “Agree Grant.” X user Paulo Ribeiro De Lemos also posed a question to Cardone, asking him about the fundamentals of Bitcoin. Grant also responded with a question, trying to compare the US dollar and Bitcoin. Paulo later replied , stating that the dollar and Bitcoin cannot be weighed on the same scale since the dollar meets all the criteria of a currency, while Bitcoin remains an asset whose intrinsic value is difficult to evaluate. Some US states are already considering having their own Bitcoin reserves Throughout his campaign, Donald Trump presented himself as the crypto president and even proposed the development of a national Bitcoin reserve at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference in Nashville to appeal to his crypto audiences. Soon after his election win, Bitcoin’s prices escalated to record highs, considering investors’ optimism of new pro-crypto policies and establishments. However, even if Trump fails to deliver on his promise of a national Bitcoin reserve, some states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Texas are planning to have their own. On November 12, Pennsylvania State Representative Mike Cabell submitted a bill to have the state use state funds for Bitcoin purchases, claiming it could help guard against inflation. Additionally , on December 12, Texas State Representative Giovanni Capriglione advanced House Bill 1598, which would allow the state to develop a Bitcoin reserve within its treasury. On December 17, Ohio joined the two when state Representative Derek Merrin proposed the same.

38188772,https://crypto.news/?p=14322671,1735315234,Lightchain AI: The Dogecoin alternative investors can’t afford to overlook,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Dogecoin’s legacy faces a challenge as Lightchain AI emerges with smart utility and real-world solutions, capturing investors’ attention. Table of Contents Dogecoin legacy of popularity Lightchain AI innovation meets real-world utility Why investors can’t ignore Lightchain AI Lightchain AI’s roadmap to success Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been the leader of memecoins, known for its community-driven charm and viral popularity. However, as the crypto market evolves, many investors are turning their attention to projects that offer real utility and long-term growth potential. Enter Lightchain AI (LCAI) Presale , a blockchain initiative that merges artificial intelligence (AI) with decentralized technology. This presale has caught the eye of savvy investors, positioning Lightchain AI as a compelling alternative to Dogecoin. Here’s why this emerging project is generating so much buzz. Dogecoin legacy of popularity Dogecoin began as a fun test in money made online, using web trends to get big notice. Over time, it has made a loyal group and got wide attention, all due to its ease and cheap price. Dogecoin’s charm is in its community-based win, power͏ed by local help and popular pushes. Its small cost per token has turned it into an easy start for new backers, while famous people backing it and news stories have kept it seen by many. But, Dogecoin has many problems. Its main use as a payment token gives few real uses and its worth is very tied to how people feel about it making it weak to sharp changes. Additionally, unlike more recent projects, Dogecoin lacks technological advancements or a clear long-term roadmap, which has led to stagnant innovation. While Dogecoin continues to thrive on community enthusiasm, its limited functionality creates opportunities for alternatives like Lightchain AI to attract investor interest. Lightchain AI innovation meets real-world utility Lightchain AI (LCAI) is setting new benchmarks by seamlessly merging blockchain technology with artificial intelligence to deliver real-world applications. Its ecosystem empowers industries like healthcare, finance, and supply chain management with decentralized solutions tailored for efficiency and scalability. The platform’s Memecoin Launchpad offers a secure and AI-driven environment for creativity, enabling users to monetize ideas within the meme economy. Decentralized governance ensures that decisions are community-driven, fostering inclusivity and fairness. Lightchain AI’s robust infrastructure supports real-time applications, while its focus on sustainability positions it as a future-proof solution in the evolving blockchain landscape. With its versatile approach and strategic roadmap, LCAI demonstrates immense potential to transform industries, making it a standout project in the blockchain and AI sectors. Why investors can’t ignore Lightchain AI 1. Real-world applications Dogecoin’s utility as a payment token is limited, whereas Lightchain AI addresses challenges in industries like healthcare, logistics, and AI development. Its AIVM offers developers a platform to create AI-powered solutions, expanding its use cases far beyond the cryptocurrency market. 2. Sustainable growth Dogecoin’s unlimited supply creates inflationary pressure, limiting its ability to sustain value. In contrast, Lightchain AI’s deflationary tokenomics reduce supply over time, aligning incentives for long-term holders. 3. Early-stage opportunity With its presale price set at $0.003, Lightchain AI offers a ground-floor opportunity for investors. Early adoption could lead to exponential returns as the project gains traction and adoption. 4. Diversification beyond meme coins While Dogecoin is rooted in its meme coin status, Lightchain AI appeals to investors seeking utility and technological advancement. Its focus on solving real-world problems makes it a diversified addition to any portfolio.

DOGE Predictions Suggest History Repeating Itself While SHIB’s Price Targets Rise,"As the cryptocurrency market gears up for 2025, key trends surrounding Dogecoin’s (DOGE) prediction, Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) price target, and BlockDAG (BDAG) achieving its mining milestones are capturing attention. Analysts are weighing in on Shiba Inu’s potential for a rise, fueled by developments like Shibarium and ShibaSwap. Meanwhile, Dogecoin enthusiasts point to historical patterns, suggesting a possible rally to $18 if trends from 2017 and 2021 repeat. BlockDAG (BDAG) is also drawing significant interest, with its BDAG X1 app surpassing 300,000 active users and its ecosystem expanding rapidly. Community-favorite miners like the X1 and X10 are driving up sales in the presale, solidifying BlockDAG’s X Series as one of the best crypto miners in the market. Shiba Inu Price Target: Will SHIB Achieve 1,000% Growth? The Shiba Inu price target for 2025 remains a topic of speculation, with some analysts forecasting a potential 1,000% rise. Currently priced at $0.00002168, SHIB is below its October 2021 peak of $0.00008616. However, new developments in its ecosystem could pave the way for significant gains. Shibarium, its upcoming Layer-2 solution, aims to improve transaction speed and reduce fees, making the token more practical for everyday use. Additionally, ShibaSwap continues to expand its utility within the network. While predictions vary, some experts suggest SHIB could climb to $0.0002913 if adoption grows and market conditions remain favorable. The “Shiba Army” remains a driving force behind the token’s resilience, sustaining momentum toward the ambitious price target. Dogecoin Prediction: Will DOGE Follow Its Historical Patterns? The Dogecoin prediction for 2025 is gaining traction as patterns align with previous cycles. Crypto analyst @krisspax recently tweeted, “The Dogecoin 4-year pattern is playing out so far this cycle… The next phase is the parabolic growth. Are you ready for $DOGE?” Dogecoin is following a familiar trajectory, mirroring its 2017 and 2021 movements, where sharp corrections led to explosive rallies. The recent TD Sequential indicator flashing a buy signal has bolstered optimism. Analysts speculate DOGE could rally by up to 5,000%, potentially reaching $18 if it replicates past performance.

This sparked debate within the cryptocurrency community and prompted a closer examination of the token’s circulation patterns and potential price implications. Steph’s recent analysis is based on CryptoQuant data . It shows that XRP’s price trajectory could experience significant upward movement due to what he perceives as supply constraints. #XRP supply is shrinking while demand is growing. The next big move is only a matter of time. pic.twitter.com/kfuX1k4fqo — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 25, 2024 Despite the token’s recent bearish performance, Steph maintains an optimistic outlook. He suggests the increasing demand and supposed supply reduction could trigger substantial price appreciation. He stated, “The next big move is only a matter of time.” However, a detailed examination of XRP’s supply metrics reveals a more nuanced situation. While the token’s maximum supply remains fixed at 100 billion, the actual reduction in circulation has been relatively modest. Although other experts have weighed in on the asset’s supply dynamics , current data indicates that only 13,275,691 XRP tokens have been permanently removed from circulation through burning mechanisms, leaving the total supply at approximately 99.986 billion tokens. This minimal reduction challenges assertions about significant supply constraints driving future price movements. Exchange Reserve Patterns Show Stability An analysis of XRP holdings on major cryptocurrency exchanges provides additional context. Throughout 2024, XRP’s presence on centralized exchanges has remained relatively stable, contrasting sharply with the declining exchange reserves observed in other major cryptocurrencies. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A look at Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange, reveals that XRP reserves dropped from 3.14 billion to 2.79 billion between November and December 16. However, these levels are now returning to the 3 billion mark, consistent with the average holdings maintained in most days of 2024. Supply Patterns of Other Cryptocurrencies The stability of the XRP’s exchange reserves becomes particularly noteworthy when compared to the declining patterns observed in other major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s exchange reserves decreased substantially from 3.07 million to 2.42 million BTC this year. Similarly, Ethereum’s exchange presence has fluctuated, dropping from 20.66 million to 18.6 million before settling at approximately 19 million tokens. Shiba Inu has also demonstrated a significant reduction in exchange reserves, declining from 167.34 trillion tokens last December to 134.4 trillion. Is XRP About to Surge? Despite the data suggesting stable supply levels, numerous market analysts maintain bullish predictions for XRP . Most of their predictions depend on other factors, not current supply metrics. While supply dynamics remain a crucial consideration, they represent just one component, and external factors might play a more significant role.

38188543,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=27232,1735314780,XRP Rally Faces Potential 25% Correction Amid Bearish Signals,"XRP’s price has surged over 300% in the past two months, reaching $2.10 on Dec. 27. However, warning signs suggest that XRP/USD could face a short-term correction, potentially erasing at least 25% of its recent gains. Descending Triangle Pattern Signals Potential Breakdown XRP’s recent losses coincide with its price movement within a descending triangle pattern, a bearish structure that often predicts further declines. This pattern is marked by lower highs forming a descending trendline, while $2.10 serves as horizontal support. A breakdown below this support level could lead to a deeper correction, with the potential downside target calculated by subtracting the triangle’s height from the breakdown point. Analysts predict XRP’s price could fall to approximately $1.64 in January 2025, representing a 25% drop from current levels. Whale Activity Suggests Distribution Sentiment On-chain data highlights bearish trends, with whale addresses showing signs of distribution. The supply held by addresses with over 1 million XRP tokens has decreased by 180 million since early December. Similarly, addresses holding 100,000 XRP have reduced their holdings by 170 million. This reduction aligns with XRP’s 26% price decline from its local high of $2.90. Large-scale selling by whales can increase token supply in circulation, exerting downward pressure on prices. Rising Reserves on Binance Indicate Bearish Sentiment XRP reserves on Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, have steadily increased since mid-December. This trend often signals bearish sentiment, as rising reserves typically precede price corrections. Combined with the descending triangle pattern and on-chain whale activity, XRP may face challenges in sustaining its bullish momentum.

In the latest economic outlook report, economists predict that core inflation, a key measure closely watched by the Fed, could fall below its 2% target at some point in 2025. But this improvement in inflation is expected to coincide with an increase in the unemployment rate, which is projected to rise to 4.4% or higher by the end of 2025. With inflation falling and unemployment rising, the Fed could respond with aggressive rate cuts that exceed current market expectations. The report suggests the Fed could cut interest rates by more than the 35 basis points currently expected by U.S. money markets. The optimal federal funds rate could be as low as 3.3%, Paidenreiger’s analysis suggests, which would require at least four rate cuts in 2025. Related News: Terra (LUNA) Founder Do Kwon's Fate Finally Certain - Here's What Happens Next The Fed has already begun cutting interest rates, cutting its benchmark interest rate by a full percentage point in each of its three meetings since September. But central bankers have signaled a slower pace of cuts going forward. According to the Fed’s latest economic projections, policymakers expect to cut interest rates by just three-quarters of a percentage point through 2024. The forecasts underscore the delicate balancing act the Fed faces as it navigates a cooling economy. While getting inflation under control remains a priority, rising unemployment poses a challenge for policymakers aiming to maintain economic stability. *This is not investment advice.

38190370,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106764,1735314572,Bitcoin Price Forecast: CME Gap Could Drive BTC Down to $77K,"Market analysts expect an imminent Bitcoin crash that would allow the asset to fill the latest visible CME gap on the 1-week chart. In this latest Bitcoin price news , Bitcoin recently fell to $95,212 after briefly surpassing $99,000 during a Christmas rally. The market's ongoing turbulence has triggered concerns about further declines, with analysts warning of a potential drop to $77,000 to close a critical CME gap. Factors Pointing to Potential Bitcoin DropEGRAG, a prominent analyst, pointed out that Bitcoin has experienced several massive corrections since October 2022, with average losses of about 23.5%. The current market environment suggests a similar pattern could unfold, with a potential decline aligning with the historical average. Notably, this would place Bitcoin's next key support zone in the $77,000–$80,000 range, where a CME gap resides. Bitcoin CME Gap | EGRAG Crypto Notably, this CME gap occurred on the back of the early November uptrend following Donald Trump's election victory . Bitcoin closed the week ending on Nov. 8 at $77,360 but then began the next week starting Nov. 11 at $81,210, creating the gap. EGRAG also called attention to the 21-week EMA, which currently sits near $80,000. According to the analyst, this metric suggests the possibility of another flash crash to these levels. Bitcoin 21W EMA | EGRAG Crypto In addition, EGRAG noted that market makers might exploit upcoming events, such as the U.S. presidential inauguration in January 2025, as a trigger for selling pressure. This is another event that could potentially contribute to the imminent crash.However, he remains confident that Bitcoin will eventually reach $120,000 at some point. Nonetheless, EGRAG is unsure if the crypto asset will first rally to $120,000 before dipping to fill the CME gap or if it will immediately dip to the CME gap before rallying to the $120,000 mark.Importance of the CME GapMeanwhile, XForceGlobal, another analyst, also highlighted the importance of CME gaps in Bitcoin's price behavior. He stressed that historical data indicates that the market has eventually filled 90% of daily CME gaps larger than $1,000. https://twitter.com/XForceGlobal/status/1871435676975247575However, the timing and method of filling such gaps often remain unpredictable. The analyst outlines two scenarios: Bitcoin could experience a wave-4 correction, resulting in a drop to the $77,000–$80,000 range, or it could revisit this gap much later, possibly during a more significant market correction to the $46,000 level. Other experts, like Ali Martinez, previously stressed the importance of Bitcoin holding its current support zone between $97,041 and $93,806. He contends that failure to maintain this level could lead to a decline to $70,085, given the lack of substantial support below this range. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1870778980946645243Further, Elliott Wave analysts suggest Bitcoin may not have completed its wave-B correction.

Killing two birds with one stone, he contended that the immigration of only highly qualified foreign workers to the US could save Silicon Valley. Musk wrote on his social platform X, “The number of people who are super talented engineers and super motivated in the USA is far too low. ” Many people, especially native Americans, were not happy with his statement. To that end, he further explained, “Of course, my companies and I would prefer to hire Americans, and we do, as that is much easier than going through the incredibly painful and slow work visa process however, there is a dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America.” “I'm extremely pro-immigrant. I believe we need a greatly expanded legal immigration system. We should let anyone in the country who is hardworking and honest and will be a contributor to the US.” — Elon Musk pic.twitter.com/N0PmKQUOFi — Dima Zeniuk (@DimaZeniuk) October 17, 2024 Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) partner Vivek Ramaswamy similarly argued there are too few competitive U.S.-born engineering candidates, suggesting it’s a cultural issue. D.O.G.E’s new initiative has calmed many immigrants down, as it seems that America is giving them a chance. However, many Americans’ employment is threatened. From anti-immigrant to pro-immigrant? Only for Silicon Valley Musk’s views come as some immigration hardliners have expressed concern about President-elect Trump’s choice of Indian-American venture capitalist Sriram Krishnan for an adviser position for AI in the new administration. Krishnan has previously pushed Musk, who is close to Trump and would chair the Department of Government Efficiency, to convince the president to lift the bar on green cards for highly talented individuals born in other countries. Source: X David Sacks, who Trump tapped as White House AI and cryptocurrency czar, defended Krishnan’s view in an X post. He said, “Sriram still supports skills-based criteria for receiving a green card, not making the program unlimited. In fact, he wants to make the program entirely merit-based.” Elon Musk replied to the conversation, asserting, “Makes sense.” However, Laura Loomer, a fervent Trump supporter, slammed Krishnan’s appointment. She claimed that he wanted to lift green card limitations for foreign students. She argued that foreigners would take jobs that should be given to American STEM students. She added, “It’s alarming to see the number of career leftists who are now being appointed to serve in Trump’s admin when they share views that are in direct opposition to Trump’s America First agenda.” Trump prepares to execute an ambitious and contentious immigration strategy. It includes mass deportations of undocumented immigrants and potentially naturalized citizens. This makes the discussion of Silicon Valley’s employment practices timely. Musk and Ramaswamy have both expressed their support for Trump’s immigration policies. Silicon Valley’s national security shift under Trump’s administration Eight years ago, nobody in Silicon Valley backed Donald Trump. However, Trump and his party appear to have made inroads in Silicon Valley in recent years. Several tech executives who had previously supported Democrats endorsed Trump’s presidential campaign this year. In addition to his number one supporter, Musk, many of Trump’s Silicon Valley nominees backed his campaign, demonstrating the president-elect’s willingness to reward loyalty in his new administration. Silicon Valley is rapidly going down upon Washington as tech leaders assume significant roles in President-elect Trump’s second term, both officially and unofficially. For status, David Sacks, a venture capitalist, was appointed by President Trump earlier this month to serve as the White House administrator of AI and crypto. This position is responsible for directing the administration’s policy on these two technologies. Also, Trump appointed Jacob Helberg, a senior consultant to Palantir Technologies’ CEO, as Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment. In addition, Jim O’Neill, a biotech investor and close colleague of venture capitalist Peter Thiel, will become the administration’s deputy secretary of Health and Human Services. Trump is reportedly contemplating the appointment of Shyam Sankar, Palantir’s chief technology officer, to the position of chief research and engineering officer at the Defense Department. Still, Trae Stephens, co-founder of Anduril, has been considered for a position at the Pentagon. Trump’s allies are now this consistent procession of Silicon Valley titans. This ensures the companies involved enjoy several advantages. For example, the US government will be hesitant to impose excessive restrictions on the development of AI. This is if it increasingly perceives its dominance in technologies as a national security issue of almost existential strategic importance. Indeed, under the new Trump administration, more deregulation is likely. However, there is reason to be concerned about the rising synergy between Silicon Valley elements and the national security apparatus. Also, the implications for future technological growth, tensions with China, and the intertwining of military and economic power. Silicon Valley’s rising securitization will have an impact on the types of breakthroughs that emerge from the technology sector. Technologies designed for the military, such as drones and surveillance tools, tend to make their way into civilian life. Potentially, it could introduce new, increasingly dangerous technology.

38188391,https://finbold.com/?p=223502,1735314417,Bitcoin price prediction for 2025,"Bitcoin ( BTC ) saw explosive momentum starting in early November. By December 4, the leading cryptocurrency reached a new all-time high — closing above $100,000 for the first time in history. However, in mid-December, the Federal Reserve announced that it would only make two rate cuts in 2025. Both the stock market and the cryptocurrency market saw an immediate pullback — on December 20, as much as $310 billion in value stored in digital assets was erased. Things have improved somewhat since then — BTC has not reclaimed the $100,000 mark as of press time, but it has retraced back to approximately $96,240. Over the course of the last 7 trading days, Bitcoin has seen prices increase by just 0.78% — with year-to-date (YTD) returns standing at 128.02%. BTC price weekly and YTD charts. Source: Finbold On the whole, cryptocurrency researchers and analysts remain bullish — but this recent macro-induced shock has brought a renewed wave of concern that the premier digital asset could see a steep correction before resuming its upward trajectory. Analysts have largely turned bearish on BTC — at least in the short term There’s no denying that an abundance of bearish signals are present — but the fundamental drivers of Bitcoin’s recent upswing are still in place. First, let’s deal with the negatives. Over 33,000 BTC, worth a grand total of roughly $3.23 billion , has been transferred to cryptocurrency exchanges over the past week. Historically, such moves have preceded large-scale liquidations on the part of crypto whales — and while not definitive, this is yet another bearish signal. Renowned cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez recently compiled a shortlist of analyst forecasts — most of which are quite bearish, and predict a drop (albeit a short-term one) to prices between $60,000 and $70,000. #Bitcoin $BTC will CRASH to $60,000!!! At least, that's what some of the most renowned analysts are saying. Let's dive in 👇🧵 — Ali (@ali_charts) December 26, 2024 Noted cryptocurrency technical analyst RLinda outlined both a bullish and bearish case — per the analysis provided in a December 25 TradingView post , a consolidation above $99,000 would most likely see BTC prices surge to $104,000. BTC price chart with predictions. Source: RLinda on TradingView In contrast, if the charts on the shorter timeframes keep printing lower lows, the asset could once again plummet to the recent low of $92,000. Bullish signals for BTC are still present Even once we take into account that the ATH price could not hold, BTC has still outperformed 75% of the top 100 crypto assets in a 1-year period. The leading digital asset is currently trading above its 200-day simple moving average, indicating that the uptrend is still in play. At present, the level of support sits at roughly $92,143 — in contrast, a resistance level of $100,188 would have to be breached for a renewed rally. While moves to the downside like the ones seen in the past few weeks are worrying, outsized returns and increasing institutional adoption will most likely win out in the end. In essence, no new bearish catalysts specific to Bitcoin have sprung up — meaning that there is no particular reason to see recent price action as anything but a relatively expected reaction to macroeconomic factors.

38188318,https://nulltx.com/?p=137031,1735314345,"As the Solana Ecosystem Cools, Investors Are Flocking to Remittix for Gains After ‘XLM Killer’ Tag","The crypto market is cooling off right now after the bullish rally that saw many tokens rise on the price charts. Currently, top crypto coins like Solana (SOL) are cooling off, seeing some slight dips on the price charts. Although market analysts like The Moon Show have made some bullish price predictions for this token, many investors are now looking elsewhere for profits. One noteworthy project everyone is flocking to is Remittix (RTX) – a presale star that has gained the title “XLM Killer.” This is because of its unique strategy and great potential in the cross-border payments market. Many experts even foresee this rookie being the next 10x altcoin in 2025. Solana (SOL) Price Dips, but Analyst Makes a Bold Price Prediction Solana (SOL) is one of the best cryptos in the market. However, it has recently seen a slight price dip. According to CoinMarketCap , the price of Solana has fallen over 20% in the past 30 days. Its value moved between nearly $250 and around $190. However, crypto analyst The Moon Show remains optimistic for the future of Solana (SOL). In a recent X post, he told his followers that this altcoin has retested a massive triangle on the weekly chart. He put a medium-term target of $330 as a Solana price prediction. The technicals for the Solana coin back up this claim. Currently, TradingView shows that this altcoin is valued above its 200-day EMA ($175) and has a momentum indicator of -25, which is in the buy zone. These indicators show that this altcoin could see a bullish upswing again. But while its price consolidates, many investors are looking at Remittix for fast returns instead. Remittix (RTX) Earns the “XLM Killer” Name in Ongoing Crypto ICO Event While Solana (SOL) is experiencing some turbulence right now, Remittix (RTX) is making a name for itself. It is positioning itself to capitalize on the growth of the cross-border payments market, which Mordor Intelligence predicts may be worth $295B by 2029. In fact, some investors look at Remittix as the XLM Killer as it could challenge its dominance and other traditional banking systems, too. To accomplish this, Remittix will launch a unique crypto-to-fiat network that will let traders instantly convert over 40 crypto coins into Fiat currencies, which are then sent to any bank account. Thanks to this aspect, Remittix is already rivaling Stripe or Wise, which do not offer this feature. Plus, these transactions will come with a flat fee, as there are no hidden costs. Those looking to support this project are now buying its native token, RTX. Currently, this altcoin costs only $0.0163, which is the starting price of its presale. But, as the presale advances, more price pumps will come. The next stage will cause a jump to $0.0167 – a 3% return for all those who buy it now. A Tier-1 CEX listing this crypto coin could also trigger a massive pump to $0.10. Therefore, investors consider RTX one of the altcoins to watch for fast returns. Can Remittix (RTX) Become the Next Big Thing Like Solana (SOL)? Although Solana (SOL) has become one of the top crypto coins that could rebound soon, experts claim Remittix (RTX) could be the next star in this space. Its groundbreaking technology will redefine the future of cross-border payments and its great growth potential could make early buyers very wealthy. Its smaller market cap also signals faster price growth with less money needed. Therefore, many experts consider RTX the next potential 10x altcoin in 2025.

Ripple ( XRP ) price was trading at $2.2 after falling 25% from its highest point this year, meaning it remains in a bear market. One of the biggest XRP catalysts is the rising optimism that the SEC will approve a spot Ripple ETF in 2025. Companies like Bitwise, Canary Capital, 21Shares, and WisdomTree have already submitted their XRP ETF proposals. There are rising odds that other companies like Fidelity, Blackrock, and Ark Invest will file their XRP ETFs because of its scale and their success in Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. Blackrock has accumulated over $52 billion in Bitcoin ( BTC ) and $3.54 billion in Ethereum ( ETH ) funds.

The hopes for a Ripple ETF rose after Donald Trump won the general election in November. He has already nominated Paul Atkins to be the next SEC chair , a move that will introduce major regulatory changes. Analysts expect a few major ETF approvals in 2024. The XRP price will likely do well as the XRP Ledger and the RLUSD stablecoin continue to gain market share. According to CoinMarketCap , the RLUSD has gained over $53 million in market cap a few weeks after launch. XRP price forecast XRP price chart | Source: crypto.news Ripple price peaked at $2.90 in December and has retreated by 25% from its highest point this year. It has remained above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages, a sign that the uptrend is continuing. Most importantly, the XRP price is in a consolidation mode and is forming a bullish pennant pattern. This pattern, which can take a few days or weeks to form, comprises a vertical line, a flag pole, and a symmetrical triangle. It will be confirmed that the ripple’s pennant remains inside the two triangle sides. Therefore, the XRP token will likely have a strong bullish breakout in the next few weeks as ETF odds rise. If this happens, the next key level to watch will be at $2.90, the highest point this year, which is about 35% above the current level. A surge above that price will push it to $3 and potentially to $5.

In its latest budget report, Kyrgyzstan received 46.6 million soms (approx $512,600) in cryptocurrency mining tax compared to 93.7 million soms (approx $1 million) received back in 2023. In Kyrgyzstan the cryptocurrency mining tax rate is 10% of the electricity bill. The Kyrgyz government released the 2024 budget document, and the cryptocurrency mining tax contributed about $535,000 in taxes to the country's economy. The cryptocurrency mining tax rate in Kyrgyzstan is 10% of the electricity bill. https://t.co/asUSsqBbsB — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 27, 2024 Rise in Electricity Costs Impacts Kyrgyzstan This sharp decline in tax income is linked to a combination of factors, including rising electricity costs, which have made crypto mining less profitable. As energy prices increase, many miners have scaled back operations or relocated to countries with more favorable conditions. The decline in mining activity has severely impacted the government’s ability to generate revenue from this sector. In December, Kyrgyzstan urged its residents to use less electricity, as it struggled with record-high winter demand, as reported by AP news. Once-Booming Crypto Mining Sector Sees Decline These challenges are not only straining households and industries but are also causing a decline in tax revenues from the once-booming crypto mining sector. Crypto mining, the process of validating cryptocurrency transactions and adding them to a blockchain, requires huge amounts of computational power and, by extension, electricity. Kyrgyzstan’s historically low energy costs made it an attractive destination for mining operations, attracting both domestic and international players. These operations generated significant tax revenues for the government, as crypto miners were subject to specific taxation policies. Why Are Electricity Costs Rising? Kyrgyzstan’s energy sector faces several structural challenges. The country relies heavily on hydropower, which accounts for over 90% of its electricity generation, according to data from the World Bank. However, aging hydropower infrastructure and fluctuating water levels have limited its capacity to meet growing demand. Kyrgyzstan also imports electricity during peak consumption periods, exposing the country to global energy price fluctuations. In recent years, the government has introduced higher tariffs to address financial shortfalls in the energy sector and fund infrastructure upgrades. While these measures are necessary for long-term sustainability, they have made electricity less affordable for crypto miners. Some countries such as Russia are addressing energy concerns by implementing seasonal restrictions in key mining areas to prevent power outages.

In a new strategy session, pseudonymous crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 236,200 followers on the social media platform X that altcoins are due to explode over the coming weeks. According to Sherpa, one catalyst that will drive the altcoin rally is the fact that many of them have been capitulating for a long time. “Coins like [privacy-focused] Oasis (ROSE) chopped around for YEARS and are still consolidating. Hard to think these won’t fully send.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Sherpa further says that the layer-1 blockchain Tron ( TRX ) is another good example of an altcoin that underwent consolidation for years before it skyrocketed recently. “So I expect something extremely strong for the next run here for these shitcoins because of how long they consolidated for. Not saying they’ll necessarily all hit or go past former all-time highs, but let’s see.” The analyst also cites other reasons that fuel his bullish stance, such as Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) dominance level and the macro-environment. “People call me bearish but I’m not bearish at all – I think that we’re going to have an incredible altcoin season in the coming months. This is due to several reasons (seasonality, Bitcoin dominance [at a] high, insane macro + government [environment], etc).” On when to potentially take profits, Sherpa says , “You don’t necessarily have to sell now; I don’t think it’s needed yet. We should have a great time in January/February.

38187811,https://coinpedia.org/?p=399033,1735313323,"Top Altcoins to Consider in 2025: AVAX, ONDO & FTM Prices To Attract Massive Gains","The post Top Altcoins to Consider in 2025: AVAX, ONDO & FTM Prices To Attract Massive Gains appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto markets are heading towards the end of the yearly trade that has been historically bullish, even in times of a bear market. Meanwhile, the current trend suggests the buyers have been facing extreme exhaustion at the moment, which suggests the yearly close may not be as bullish as expected. However, these three altcoins, AVAX, FTM, & ONDO, are expected to trigger a massive rise in 2025. Avalanche (AVAX) Price Prediction 2025 The Avalanche price has been trading within a decisive phase after it faced a rejection from the highs above $140. Meanwhile, the bulls managed to hold the rally above the crucial support and as a result, the token has advanced towards the end of its consolidation. Now that the token has reached the final phase of 2025, a significant shift in the market trend could occur. The AVAX price failed to surpass the resistance of the decisive triangle but after a small retracement, the price has triggered a rebound. Besides, the weekly Gaussian channel has turned bullish after a small bearish trend. Therefore, the AVAX price could maintain an ascending consolidation and breach above the upper resistance.Mainly because the RSI has been trading within a recovery curve and is yet to reach the upper threshold. Therefore, the price is expected to rise high and reach levels above $160 to $170 during H1 2025. Ondo (ONDO) Price Prediction 2025 The Ondo price faced a significant upswing in the first few days of November, which has printed consecutive higher highs and lows. The latest rebound from the rising support of the expanding channel indicates the bulls are vigilant and hence are defending the support. However, the technicals do not offer a bullish confirmation. Therefore, this rebound could be another fake-out, trapping the bulls as the correction does not appear to have reached the end. The price has entered the pivotal support range between $1.44 and $1.5 and a rise above the upper range could trigger a decent upswing. Meanwhile, the technicals remain bearish as the RSI forms constant lower highs and lows and MACD displays a rise in the selling pressure. Therefore, th ONDO price is believed to break the current support zone and eventually test the immediate support at $1.28. A rebound may be expected if RSI reaches the oversold zone; otherwise, a drop to $1.077 could also be possible. However, a rebound from this range may attract fresh buying volume that may eventually help the price reclaim the lost levels and push the price to the pivotal resistance zone between $1.94 and $1.99. Fantom (FTM) Price Prediction 2025 The Fantom price is about to test the average bands of the rising parallel channel after facing rejection from the interim highs at $1.44. While the market participants may expect a rebound, the bears appear to be preparing for a wider correction. On the other hand, the token is about to undergo the very first Golden Cross in the weekly time frame. Hence, the token remains within a decisive phase as the price continues to face enough bearish pressure. The weekly MACD displays a drop in the buying pressure while the levels are about to undergo a bearish crossover. This indicates a potential pullback to the interim support just below $0.8 that may delay the Golden Cross for a while. After the selling volume exhausts, the price could trigger a rebound and march towards the upper resistance. However, a breakout from the channel could occur only if the bulls manage to mount enough pressure over the token; otherwise, the price may remain consolidated within a range for an extended price action.",NEUTRAL,AVAX | ONDO,ALTCOIN | AVAX | MARKET | TRADING | ONDO,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/top-altcoins-to-consider-in-2025-avax-ondo-ftm-prices-to-attract-massive-gains/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Today, a record $18 billion in options expired , marking the last major expiry of the year, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) seeing large volumes of contracts reach their conclusion.Bitcoin and Ethereum Options Data HighlightsSpecifically, a total of 150,000 Bitcoin options expired with a staggering notional value of $14.17 billion. Notably, these contracts expired with a Put-Call Ratio of 0.69.This figure suggests that more call options were traded relative to put options, signaling that investors are leaning toward a bullish market outlook.Meanwhile, Ethereum options saw 1.12 million expired today, with a notional value of $3.74 billion.Despite these large expirations, the market has been relatively quiet, with no major volatility due to the overlap with the Christmas holiday. However, experts believe this lull is temporary, with significant optimism for the future.Notably, Bitcoin is trading at $96,329, with a 0.7% uptick over the past day. Ethereum is also trading at $3,387, with a gain of less than 1% today.Beyond this passive market today, Bitcoin has already seen strong gains in 2024. Its price more than doubled this year, rising from $42,000 to over $108K, boasting a one-year gain of 120%.Bitcoin's late-year rally since November set a bullish tone for the broader crypto market, benefiting others like Ethereum. This month, Ethereum set a fresh year-high above $4,100.These strong performances in the market's leaders have lifted sentiment, with investors and analysts increasingly optimistic about the trajectory for 2025.Bitcoin in 2025Crypto enthusiasts expect the return of Donald Trump to the White House next month to usher in what many consider to be the most crypto-friendly presidency in U.S. history. This is expected to boost crypto market sentiment further.Moreover, market commentators believe prominent crypto advocates like Elon Musk will have more energy to promote crypto innovation under the incoming Trump administration.Other key drivers of growth for 2025 that market participants have highlighted include the increasing adoption of cryptocurrency by governments and major corporations. Specifically, the U.S. government and corporations like MicroStrategy plan to continue stockpiling Bitcoin as a reserve asset, which could catalyze a long-term price surge.With this promising outlook, experts have projected even a $200K price level as conservative for Bitcoin in 2025.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/27/record-18b-in-bitcoin-and-ethereum-options-expire-sparking-optimism-for-2025/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=record-18b-in-bitcoin-and-ethereum-options-expire-sparking-optimism-for-2025,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
38187598,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99404,1735312897,Top Analyst Says Ripple’s XRP On Course To Hit $27 As Highly Reliable Technical Setup Emerges,"The price of Ripple-linked cryptocurrency XRP has witnessed considerable selling pressure recently following a crypto-wide drawdown last week. However, this has not deterred analysts from sharing ultra-bullish targets for the coin. Popular chart analyst EGRAG Crypto eyes an explosive rally to $27 historic highs in this market cycle based on a key technical setup. Historical Pattern Hints At $27 XRP Price EGRAG Crypto noted in a Dec. 26 X post that XRP has crossed the 21 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) over a two-week timeframe, suggesting a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency. When this happened in 2017, XRP saw a 50,000% price jump. If history repeats itself, the analyst projected that the coin could climb to $27, representing a 4,770% price increase. When compared to the 2017 mega upsurge, a pump to the $27 level would be just around 10% of the meteoric growth witnessed back then. EGRAG Crypto voiced confidence that the Ripple-promoted token would reach this price point, citing the coin’s stratospheric price action back in 2017. Notably, the XRP price has successfully held above the psychologically important $2 level despite the latest market catastrophe. The next resistance for XRP lies at $2.60, a decisive break above it would set the stage for a surge past its current lifetime high of $3.84 and beyond. XRP’s historic record fuels anticipation for a repeat of its previous achievements amid heightened adoption. Upcoming SEC Leadership Shakeup, Potential XRP ETFs To Boost XRP Price Industry commentators have been optimistic that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will finally settle with Ripple following Donald Trump’s victory against Kamala Harris in the November 2024 presidential elections. This could be a watershed moment, marking the conclusion of the multi-year-long courtroom showdown. Pundits and investors alike have high expectations for upcoming Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Paul Atkins. XRP has already gained over 300% since Trump’s electoral win , with experts anticipating an extended upsurge. Moreover, there’s been an increasing demand for spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) following the resounding success of similar products based on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Some popular asset managers such as Bitwise , Canary Capital , 21Shares , and WisdomTree have already filed paperwork with the SEC for an investment vehicle offering direct XRP exposure. The anticipated approval of XRP ETFs for listing on Wall Street could spark renewed interest, propelling the price of XRP to double digits. In October, Garlinghouse said he believes greenlighting of XRP ETFs is “inevitable.”",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | XRP,BTC | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/top-analyst-says-ripples-xrp-on-course-to-hit-27-as-highly-reliable-technical-setup-emerges/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

For the first time, the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) is letting commercial banks and payment companies handle stablecoins and other cryptos backed by real-world assets. But if you’re a Bitcoin or Ether enthusiast, don’t get excited. Those are still banned, and the government isn’t budging on that. This step was announced on December 27 after a directive was issued the day before. This new law gives stablecoins a green light but comes with a truckload of conditions. Financial institutions have to play by the NBC’s rules. Cambodia’s messy history with crypto Cambodia has always been allergic to crypto. Before now, trading them was straight-up illegal. Officials blamed it on risks like money laundering, scams, and shady black-market dealings. These coins have been public enemy number one for years. But it’s not like they didn’t notice the global crypto boom. As crypto gained traction worldwide, the NBC decided it needed to catch up without losing control. Enter the prakas of December —a measured, tightly regulated approach to crypto adoption. The decentralized nature of cryptos makes them a nightmare for regulation, taxation, and tracking. Still, he admitted banks could rake in revenue through user fees if they jump into crypto. Back in 2020, the NBC launched Bakong, its own central bank digital currency (CBDC). Bakong was meant to reduce the country’s dependence on the US dollar and give people a local, digital payment system. By late 2024, Bakong allegedly had 200,000 active users and had processed 1.4 million transactions worth $500 million. But this year alone, the government blocked access to 16 major crypto exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase, because they didn’t have proper licenses. And yet, Cambodia ranks in the top 20 countries globally for retail crypto use per capita. Around 70% of transactions happen through centralized exchanges, proving that Cambodians are finding ways to embrace crypto, even with all the red tape. Statista estimates Cambodia’s crypto market will generate $8 million in revenue by the end of 2024. However, growth is expected to slow down in 2025 as regulations tighten and competition from global players ramps up. The challenges of crypto in Cambodia It’s not all smooth sailing for Cambodia’s crypto experiment. The government’s strict rules come from a place of fear. The UN Office on Drugs & Crime has actually flagged Cambodia as a hotspot for crypto scams. There’s also a massive knowledge gap. The NBC has stressed the importance of public education about crypto risks, but that’s easier said than done. Without proper awareness, Cambodians continue to fall victim to scams. And then there’s the infrastructure problem. While Bakong set the stage for digital payments, it’s not enough. Platforms like Royal Group Exchange (RGX) are still in the early stages, operating under a regulatory sandbox set up by the Securities and Exchange Regulator of Cambodia (SERC). The sandbox allows companies to test services under close government supervision, but scaling these efforts will take time, money, and trust. For now, the NBC seems content to stick with stablecoins.

This price point has emerged as a pivotal support level, defended vigorously by buyers amid market uncertainties. Despite facing bearish pressures near the descending trendline at $0.33172, Dogecoin’s loyal community and significant market activity suggest potential for further price movement. Why Dogecoin’s Price is Gaining Momentum Dogecoin ’s recent performance can be attributed to several key drivers: Community and Retail Investor Support: Dogecoin’s enduring popularity among retail investors and its community-driven nature play a crucial role in its upward momentum. Social media platforms, endorsements from figures like Elon Musk, and active participation have consistently bolstered its price. Broader Market Sentiment: Bitcoin’s push toward new highs has created a trickle-down effect benefiting altcoins like Dogecoin. Positive sentiment surrounding Bitcoin often spills over, driving interest in smaller-cap coins. Adoption as Payment Method: Growing acceptance of Dogecoin for payments by businesses enhances its utility beyond a “meme coin.” This increased use case legitimizes the asset in the eyes of investors and builds a foundation for sustained growth. Market Volume and Its Role in Price Stability Dogecoin’s trading volume of $2.6 billion underscores robust investor interest and strong market activity. High trading volume signifies liquidity and confidence, making it harder for the price to dip below key levels such as $0.30. This support has been instrumental in defending the price against potential sell-offs. Bulls are actively working to stabilize Dogecoin’s value above $0.30, aware that a breach of this level could trigger widespread selling. The high volume also indicates anticipation of future upward momentum, particularly if broader crypto market conditions improve. Additionally, Dogecoin’s resilience amid broader market volatility, fueled by geopolitical concerns and Federal Reserve commentary, demonstrates its ability to withstand external pressures. The consistent defense of $0.30 marks it as a critical level for investors to watch. Technical Outlook: Will DOGE Breakout? DOGE consolidates near $0.314581, eyeing resistance at $0.32436 & $0.33172. Support sits at $0.30393, with deeper levels at $0.28509 & $0.26226. RSI: 43.85 shows bearish momentum.

The 50-day EMA at $0.32400 aligns closely with resistance, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 43.85 reflects bearish momentum. A breakout above $0.32436 could pave the way for Dogecoin to test $0.34182. However, failure to hold $0.30393 could signal further downside toward $0.28509. key Insights: Dogecoin is defending $0.30 with significant trading volume of $2.6 billion. Immediate resistance levels are $0.32436 and $0.33172; support rests at $0.30393. RSI and downward trendline indicate bearish momentum, but a breakout could signal recovery.

The latest transaction saw the whale move 0.01 ETH to an unknown address, “0x296…Ee557,” today at 04:40 a.m. (UTC). With ETH currently trading at $3,394 per coin, this transaction is worth $33.94 at press time. This marks the wallet’s first transaction since it first received 1,940 ETH coins during the Ethereum ICO in 2015.

The following month, a wallet that also participated in the Ethereum ICO transferred $12.22 million worth of ETH tokens to Kraken. These developments come as Ethereum attempts to recover from the recent downturn that plunged its price to near $3,000.

From the U.S. approval of spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds to the burgeoning number of companies pledging to buy the largest cryptocurrency for their treasuries, crypto has entered, more than ever before, the mainstream conversation.  Bitcoin has increased almost 130% this year, breaking record highs on several occasions. It is currently hovering near the psychological threshold of $100,000. The ETFs approved in January have seen net inflows of $36 billion and amassed over 1 million BTC.  In addition, the number of publicly traded companies saying they're adding bitcoin to their corporate treasury is accelerating. The trend, which started with MicroStrategy (MSTR) in 2020, recently attracted KULR Technology (KULR), a maker of energy storage products for the space and defense industries. The Houston, Texas-based company said it bought 217.18 BTC for $21 million and is allocating up to 90% of the surplus to cash to BTC.  Now Bitwise Asset Management, which already has spot bitcoin and ether ETFs, has applied for an exchange-traded fund to track the shares of companies that hold at least 1,000 BTC in treasury. Other requirements for the fund, dubbed Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF, are a market capitalization of at least $100 million, a minimum average daily liquidity of at least $1 million and a public free float of less than 10%, according to the Dec. 26 filing.  A second Thursday filing was made by Strive Asset Management, co-founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, a politician in the administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. The Bitcoin Bond ETF seeks exposure through derivative instruments such as MicroStrategy's convertible securities in an actively managed ETF. The bonds have been a massive success. The 0% coupon bond maturing in 2027 is priced at 150% above par and has outperformed bitcoin since inception.      ""Since our inception, Strive has called out the long-term investment risks caused by the global fiat debt crisis, inflation, and geopolitical tensions,"" Strive CEO Matt Cole told CoinDesk. ""We strongly believe there is no better long-term investment to hedge against these risks than thoughtful exposure to bitcoin.""

Pudgy Penguins: A Solana-Based Success with Challenges Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) entered the Solana blockchain with high hopes and a community-centric vision. Its initial airdrop rewarded early supporters, distributing 88.88 billion tokens with 25.9% allocated to the Pudgy Penguins community. The excitement pushed PENGU’s price up by 500%, hitting an all-time high of $0.06845. However, post-airdrop sell-offs have dampened its momentum. The token’s price now sits at approximately $0.0273, a steep decline of over 50% from its peak. Despite this, Pudgy Penguins remain a force to reckon with. Its market capitalisation of $1.7 billion places it among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, and its NFT project continues to captivate collectors. Plans for multi-chain expansion to Ethereum and Abstract could reinvigorate PENGU’s growth. For now, though, volatility remains a concern, with investors cautiously optimistic about its long-term prospects. Book of Meme: Navigating Liquidity Concerns Book of Meme (BOME) has carved out its niche as a meme coin with a focus on community engagement. Trading at $0.0061, BOME boasts a 24-hour trading volume of $145 million and a market cap of $421 million. However, Binance’s recent decision to delist the BOME/BTC trading pair has raised questions about its liquidity and future stability. The delisting, effective December 27, 2024, comes at a critical juncture. While it’s a setback, BOME’s loyal community continues to rally behind the project, emphasising its potential for growth despite challenges. As the market adapts, BOME’s ability to weather volatility will determine its place in the meme coin ecosystem. Conclusion In today’s volatile crypto market, opportunities abound for those willing to take calculated risks. Based on our analysis, BTFD Coin stands out as the top pick among meme coin presales to buy today. Its festive BIG50 bonus, thriving community, and innovative features like the P2E game and staking rewards make it a compelling choice. Pudgy Penguins and Book of Meme also offer unique opportunities, albeit with challenges. For investors seeking the next big thing, BTFD’s presale is a golden chance to capitalise on the chaos.

December 2024 is shaped up to be pivotal for meme coins, with BTFD Coin (BTFD) igniting frenzy through its 50% festive bonus for investors using the BIG50 gift code, record-breaking presale of over $4.5 million, and a thriving community backing its revolutionary vision. Meanwhile, Bonk (BONK) battles to retain its foothold and Dogwifhat (WIF) stirs whispers of a comeback. This is more than just another month for crypto; it’s an opportunity to position yourself for massive gains. Let’s dive into why BTFD Coin, alongside other movers, makes the Top New Meme Coins to Join in December 2024. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Game-Changer in Meme Coins Imagine logging into the BTFD P2E game’s beta version, manoeuvring through thrilling challenges, and knowing you’re part of something massive even before it launches officially. That’s the magic of BTFD Coin—a movement that’s flipping the crypto narrative. Right now, the BTFD Coin presale is offering an insane 50% bonus with the code BIG50, pricing each coin at $0.00013. If you’ve got $1,000 to invest at this stage, you’d bag a whopping 11.53 million BTFD coins. And once the coin lists at $0.0006 post-presale, your stash could multiply to $6,923.08—a jaw-dropping 592.31% ROI. Since its launch, the presale has been a rocket, smashing past $4.5 million in funding. Over 59 billion coins have already been scooped up by more than 6,700 bullish holders. With the presale in Stage 12 and a cap of 16 stages, you’ve got until January 5, 2025, to ride this wave. Beyond the numbers, the BTFD ecosystem is electrifying. Its staking platform offers an average of 90% APY, while its P2E game promises long-term utility and engagement. Though the beta is reward-free, it’s a tantalising glimpse into what’s coming. Built on Ethereum, the project boasts decentralisation, scalability, and unmatched security. Feeling the FOMO yet? To get in on this, visit the BTFD Presale Page . Connect your wallet, and enter BIG50 for the festive bonus Decide on the investment amount Secure your slice of the next big meme coin before it’s too late. Bonk (BONK): Solana’s Resilient Meme Hero BONK burst onto the scene two years ago, energising the Solana blockchain with its dog-themed appeal. While 2024 has been rocky, BONK remains a key player, trading at approximately $0.00003185. Its launch strategy—a massive airdrop to Solana users—created a loyal community that continues to drive liquidity across decentralised exchanges. BONK’s trajectory mirrors the volatility of meme coins, but its resilience is commendable. As Solana continues to evolve, BONK’s fate will likely depend on the blockchain’s broader adoption and technological advancements. For those who believe in Solana’s comeback, BONK is an intriguing option this December. Dogwifhat (WIF): The Underdog Making a Comeback WIF’s journey has been a rollercoaster. After peaking at $4.85 in March 2024, the token retraced significantly. Today, it trades at $1.87, but signs of recovery are sparking optimism. Despite setbacks, including a 15% dip in mid-2024 due to whale sell-offs, WIF’s community remains loyal. Its market capitalisation once soared above $4 billion, reflecting its potential to rebound. Analysts are cautiously optimistic about WIF’s future, especially as the new year could bring fresh momentum to Solana-based tokens. Why BTFD Stands Out The 1973 oil crisis reminds us that chaos often hides golden opportunities. Just as Warren Buffett capitalised on market dips back then, BTFD Coin’s presale gives modern investors a shot at replicating that success in crypto. With its presale structure, staking rewards, and community-driven ethos, BTFD isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a blueprint for turning downturns into upswings. The Final Word December 2024 presents a prime opportunity for meme coin enthusiasts with BTFD Coin, Bonk (BONK), and Dogwifhat (WIF) taking centre stage. BTFD’s 50% festive bonus and record-breaking presale of $4.5 million raised to make it a must-grab for investors aiming for long-term gains. BONK remains a favourite for Solana supporters, showing resilience in a volatile market, while WIF teases a potential revival that has investors intrigued. With BTFD’s presale offering a chance at a 592.31% ROI, it’s clear why it’s the leader among the Top New Meme Coins to Join in December 2024. Don’t wait—join the BTFD Presale today and claim your BIG50 bonus before the window closes on January 5, 2025.

The Montenegrin Justice Minister has signed an order to hand Do Kwon over to U.S. authorities instead of his home country, South Korea, according to local media Vijesti. Both governments have investigated Kwon and wrestled for his extradition concerning the $60 billion Terra-Luna fiasco. In 2022, Kwon’s Terra blockchain imploded and wiped out a glut of over-leveraged crypto businesses. The bankruptcy avalanche swept firms like Three Arrows Capital, BlockFi, and even FTX. Kwon fled as the crypto market depression thickened, and Interpol issued a Red Notice arrest warrant for his capture.

Before Kwon and Han Chang-joon, Terraform Labs’ former finance officer, could board a private plane at Podgorica airport, police in Montenegro’s capital city arrested the pair. They were jailed for four months while U.S. and South Korean federal prosecutors jockeyed for extradition rights in the background. The decision swayed between both governments, as several courts in Montenegro overruled extradition orders on multiple occasions. Goran Rodić, Do Kwon’s lawyer in the Balkans, also repeatedly contested extradition orders. On Dec. 25, Montenegro’s Constitutional Court dismissed Kwon’s latest appeal. Kwon’s company Terraform Labs agreed to sunset its business and the largest settlement fine in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s history — $4.47 billion. It’s unclear if Rodić will challenge the order from Minster Božović extraditing Kwon to U.S. soil, where he’ll likely be prosecuted for Terra’s collapse. South Korean authorities also have an ongoing Terra case. If found guilty of breaking local market rules, the maximum penalty would be a 40-year sentence against Kwon.

Establishing base support above $0.12, it is now gaining serious traction on a daily scale. Along with many other cryptocurrencies, GMT faced resistance in the early month after struggling to reach $0.262. It later lost momentum and rolled to a low of $0.127, where it began to increase last month. That low level held well and the price bounced back yesterday. Since then, the crypto has been gaining serious traction and is now floating at around $0.2 following an impressive surge in the past hours. Things are currently looking positive on the daily scale as it slowly foots an increase. As seen on the daily chart, it is forming a bullish (double-bottom) pattern. A further surge could lead to a serious breakout. While the last 48-hour surge signals an end to the recent correction, a rejection at $0.23 could cause a little reduction. But from the look of things, the bulls appear to be back in action on the daily chart. Amid rising demand, we can expect a bigger price movement in the next few days as the asset looks bullish on the hourly timeframe. GMT’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview As the $0.127 level continues to hold as base support, we can expect the bulls to reclaim the monthly $0.26 resistance in the next few days. The $0.335 and $0.445 levels are higher resistance to watch for a break-up. The close support levels for pullback are $0.173 and $0.145. Losing the mentioned base support could cause a serious dump to the $0.1 level.

Montenegro’s Supreme Court had previously found that the legal conditions for Kwon’s extradition were met, following requests from both South Korea and the US. However, the Justice Ministry concluded that the US request should take precedence after considering various criteria, including the seriousness of the alleged crimes, the order of the extradition requests and the defendant’s citizenship. “Considering all the facts and circumstances, including the gravity of the crimes and the possibility of extradition to another country, Minister Božović decided to approve the extradition of Kwon Do Hyeong to the United States, while rejecting the request from the Republic of Korea,” the Justice Ministry said in a statement. Related News: What is the Current State of the Process of Creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the US? Here are All the Need-to-Know Details Do Kwon, founder of the collapsed cryptocurrencies TerraUSD and LUNA, is at the center of one of the biggest financial scandals in crypto history. The collapse of these digital assets in May 2022 wiped $40 billion off the market and triggered a domino effect that led to the bankruptcy of several crypto firms. US authorities allege that Kwon misled investors and concealed assets during the collapse. The disaster left investors around the world facing devastating financial losses. Kwon and his business partner Han Cheng Jun were caught at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro on March 23, 2023. The pair were accused of using fake passports while trying to board a flight to Dubai. Kwon was later sentenced to four months in prison in Montenegro for forgery. Following his release from prison in March 2024, Kwon was taken to the Foreigners' Reception Center in Montenegro and detained there pending an extradition decision. Both the United States and South Korea had requested Kwon's extradition, but Montenegro ultimately prioritized the U.S. request based on legal and circumstantial considerations. *This is not investment advice.

Although its macro-bullish trajectory remains intact, but there’s no enough buying volume. Avax’s daily outlook remains weak following a series of drag downs since the start of the month, although the market sentiment is still considered bullish from the long-term perspective. Considering last week’s sharp rejection at the $33 low, which marks a 50% correction from where the market initiated drops earlier this month, the price recovered slightly but is now looking weak after rejecting $42. A continuous price drop may cause a broader correction to last month’s break-out level to provide a huge discount. Failure to bounce back from there may result in a serious loss until it finds firm support. But looking at the recent setup from a technical standpoint, Avax may resume bullish anytime soon. A double-bottom pattern may form above last week’s low. If that plays out, we can a fresh increase in the market. Towards the upside, the monthly high may pose a little threat. A clear break above this level could fuel another surge amid this bull cycle. As it stands, there’s still hope for the bulls. Avax’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Should the bulls fail to defend last week’s low well, the price could break through last week’s $33.6 low to the $29.9 level. Lower support levels to watch for a test are $27 and $23.9. A rebound from the current trading level could propel recovery to the $42 resistance. The higher levels to consider for a surge is $48.1, followed by $55.5.

Nonetheless, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto is sure that the leading cryptocurrency is still maintaining its trajectory to the $110,000 mark. According to the analyst, Bitcoin at $110,000 is inevitable, although there remains the possibility of more price declines in the short term. Bitcoin Price $110,000 Path And Current Correction Phase Bitcoin fell short of the $110,000 mark when it peaked at $108,135 on December 17. However, the cryptocurrency has been on a notable correction path since then and is currently about 12% below this price level. Interestingly, the Bitcoin price even corrected to $92,600 on December 23, which translated to a 14.36% decline in five days from the $108,135 all-time high. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Will Outperform Bitcoin And Ethereum, Reveals ‘Secret Under The Hood’ Although the Bitcoin price has recovered a bit since then, it has extended its correction below the $100,000 psychological threshold without any sign of a strong break to the upside. However, Titan of Crypto reaffirmed his long-term bullish stance on Bitcoin, stating that the $110,000 price level is “inevitable.” According to his analysis, Bitcoin is only undergoing a correction phase, a necessary consolidation before its next upward movement. Although the correction has largely held up above $90,000, there is still a possibility of a break below during this consolidation phase. With this in mind, Titan of Crypto highlighted that if Bitcoin were to experience further declines, the $87,000 mark could represent the “maximum pain.” This is the lowest threshold that the Bitcoin price can go to in order to keep the bullish sentiment alive among Bitcoin holders. Technical Analysis Shows Cup And Handle Pattern In Play The technical analysis is based off of Bitcoin’s price action after breaking out of the neckline of a cup and handle pattern. According to the chart below, this cup and handle pattern played out throughout the 2022 bear market, the 2023 recovery, and the 2024 bull market. Recent bullish price action in October and November saw the Bitcoin price breaking above the neckline, which opened up the stage for a bullish run. In a prior post immediately after the breakout, Titan of Crypto highlighted a price target of around $110,000, although noting the possibility of a correction before reaching the target. This correction has played out exactly as intended with the recent price decline in the past two weeks.

Reaching the $110,000 target would translate to a 15% return on investment from the current price. In another analysis posted on social media platform X, the analyst hinted at the possibility of $120,000 being the peak for Bitcoin this cycle based on Fibonacci Circle analysis. This price target dwarfs in comparison to predictions from other analysts, with projections ranging from $250,000 to $1 million.

For context, the Bitget Token (BGB) surged over 20% today, hitting a new all-time high of $8.500. The bullish upsurge took its weekly and monthly gains to 102% and 421%, respectively, bucking the overall trend in the broader market.Notably, today’s surge followed a Bitget announcement that it has updated its whitepaper, specifically on asset burns. The Bitget team introduced a mechanism that allows incessant, large incineration of the BGB token, drawing bullish momentum to the ecosystem’s native token.Bitget to Burn 40% of Total Supply.Per the release , Bitget will imminently incinerate 40% of its total supply of 2 billion BGB ($6.6 billion at the current market price). Notably, the core team reserved 40% of the ERC-20 token for itself during the token generation event (TGE) but would burn it with the new development.With the burn, BGB’s total supply would drop to 1.2 billion, boosting the asset’s scarcity. Bitget stated that the incineration event would happen at a later date, and the team would provide proof of the significant milestone on-chain.Furthermore, Bitget introduced a periodical burn mechanism. The latest addition would see the exchange allocate 20% of its quarterly earnings to buying and burning the BGB token.The process would be a quarterly event where Bitget would send the specified amount in BGB to the burn address. Bitget also noted it would notify the crypto community of the incineration after each process.It bears mentioning that the Bitget token is now officially the unified utility token in the Bitget ecosystem. The exchange announced yesterday that it would merge the asset with the Bitget Wallet Token (BWB), making BGB the ultimate token for its exchange and self-custody wallet.BGB Becomes 16th Largest CryptocurrencyMeanwhile, BGB’s bullish momentum has seen it climb the crypto ranking ladder. With a market cap of $11.6 billion, the Bitget Token is the 16th largest cryptocurrency.In its rise up the cader, BGB has flipped notable assets like Polkadot (DOT), Stellar (XLM), Litecoin (LTC), and Pepe (PEPE). Furthermore, larger assets like Sui (SUI) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) now face the pressure of a possible flip if BGB's bullish momentum persists.At the time of writing, Bitget Token trades at $8.33, correcting slightly from its new all-time high of $8.50.",POSITIVE,SHIB | BGB,EXCHANGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING | BGB,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/27/bitget-token-soars-15-as-bitget-plans-to-burn-40-of-coins-total-supply/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitget-token-soars-15-as-bitget-plans-to-burn-40-of-coins-total-supply,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

38189903,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323044,1735311187,Holders Turn on BONK After ‘BURNmas’ Flop – Can BONK Price Rally 50% Again?,"The 4th biggest meme coin was expected to take center stage on Christmas Day with a promised 1.69 trillion BONK token burn, but it was instead postponed to December 26th. This delay undermined what was expected to be a significant catalyst for BONK price projections . A much smaller 100 billion BONK burn on November 13th had triggered a 50% increase in price within a week, propelling the market cap to $4 billion. This time, however, the burn was met with frustration. BONK initially dropped by 7%, but it has since recovered, with a 4.32% increase since the event. With a current market cap of around $2.43 billion, traders seem to be betting that BONK’s price may once again follow the same upward trajectory, despite the rocky reception. Late ‘BURNmas’ Sparks Community Outrage While it isn’t clear what caused the sell-off, speculators are crediting the early decline to frustration at the Bonk team for failing to execute the burn on Christmas Day as promised. Something X user BestBets criticized, stating “This is honestly starting to feel like a scam for everyone that participated and are holding bonk price is dropping and so is the trust.” in a direct address to to Bonk core contributor Nom, hours before the burn event took place. Later adding to his critique in a thread,“you will lose so much progress and coin holders by lying to the community.” A sentiment shared by other holders who backed BestBets tirade. I'm with you. We're expecting the BURN to happen as promised, and the lack of a clear update on the timeline is sad. I'm losing trust — PootieCoin (@Pootie_Coin) December 26, 2024 BONK Price Analysis: Can Bonk Rally 50% Like Before? While the delay has somewhat dampened sentiment towards the memecoin, the benefits of the burn still stand to increase token prices with a more favorable supply and demand dynamic. Particularly after the breakout of a symetrical triangle pattern forming since early 2024. BONK / USDT 1D chart, symmetrical triangle pattern breakout. Source: Binance. The burn may have been the kick needed to break the downtrend over December so far, reaffirming the pattern’s breakout path towards $0.000119, a 260% advance on current prices. This scenario seems credible, as the MACD line is currently undergoing a bullish crossover above the signal line. Historically, similar crossovers have been followed by strong price movements, often resulting in upward momentum for BONK. However, the key resistance level at $0.0000240250 remains a critical hurdle. This level has been capping BONK’s price and keeping it within a consolidation range for the past two weeks. A successful break above this resistance could pave the way for a more sustained rally going into 2025, towards the pattern’s target. This Newcomer Doesn’t Skip on Community Even with the potential for a price rebound, BestBets argument remains valid.

38186809,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99402,1735311122,"Raoul Pal Calls Ethereum’s Chart Pattern ‘One Of The Most Powerful In Crypto’, Signaling Major Breakout Coming","The price of Ethereum (ETH), the industry’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, broke down as the wider market corrected, but a well-known pundit remains optimistic about Ether’s price trajectory leading into 2025. According to macro investor and Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal, Ether could be on track to a significant price breakout in the near term. Pal’s recent comments suggest he expects further upside for the smart contract platform as the market structure clearly indicates bullish momentum and strength. Ether Stunning Rally Ahead After Recent Bullish Chart Development In a December 26 strategy session on YouTube, Raoul Pal noted that Ethereum’s weekly chart shows a bullish wedge pattern, setting the top altcoin for further upside. Ether is primed to explode higher once the bullish breakout is confirmed, Pal indicated. “So whether we break out this month, which is my hunch, and then maybe retest in the January pullback from liquidity, or we pull back here for a bit and then explode through afterward, either way, that chart, that wedge pattern, to me, is one of the most powerful patterns in all of crypto and suggests we’ve got a very big move in Ethereum to come.” The crypto OG went on to observe that the ETH/BTC pair is also exhibiting a bullish wedge pattern on its weekly chart. “It’s another wedge. This is the ETH/Bitcoin weekly cross. Look at the big picture. ETH basically is at the same level versus Bitcoin that it was in 2017. It has held value over time, which is very important. It shows that this thing is around and it’s here to stay.” Ether To Outperform Bitcoin? Raoul Pal is also convinced that ETH/BTC could skyrocket based on the ISM Manufacturing Index, which is considered an indicator of the U.S. economy’s overall health. “The business cycle is the coincident factor for the Ethereum/Bitcoin cross. So that says, as the ISM starts rising, ETH starts outperforming Bitcoin. And why is that? Well, it’s a function of ISM being confidence in the economy, disposable income, or free cash flows from businesses,” the Real Vision founder explained. He pointed out that we are currently bouncing off the bottom channel as the ISM also picks up. “We either break that wedge, which is a big deal, because that would be ETH outperforming Bitcoin even further, or we stay in that larger range but get to the top of the range. My base case is breakout and ETH outperform.” That said, this year has so far been extremely underwhelming for Ether Bulls, with the ETH/BTC pair shedding as much as 35% of its value. It remains to be seen whether ETH will successfully turn the tide in the coming year. US-listed spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have recently posted impressive inflows after underperforming earlier this year. Meanwhile, Ethereum was trading for $3,402.45 as of this writing, up 1.1% on the day, according to CoinGecko. However, the ETH price remains 30% off its all-time high mark of $4,878.26 set back in November 2021.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/raoul-pal-calls-ethereums-chart-pattern-one-of-the-most-powerful-in-crypto-signaling-major-breakout-coming/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT.

BGB soared over 20% on Friday, extending its recent gains, which have left it up over 110% within the past seven days. Meanwhile, today’s uptrend came as the cryptocurrency exchange announced a strategic token burn initiative. The trading firm revealed plans to incinerate 800 million BGB tokens to enhance the altcoin’s tokenomics. The announcement indicated: To strengthen the BGB ecosystem, Bitget will burn 800 million tokens held by the core team, representing 40% of the total supply.

That will reduce BGB’s total supply by approximately 40%. Moreover, Bitget will introduce routine BGB burns, trimming asset supply at the start of each quarter. The exchange will allot 20% of its revenue from wallet and exchange operations to buy back and cremate BNB.

38186817,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633999,1735311007,Reduced AI spending could dent prospects for semiconductor companies,"Advantest CEO Doug Lefever told the Financial Times that semiconductor firms stand to suffer immensely if AI spending reduces. Although these firms have already made huge investments in data centers to enhance their AI systems, competition in the industry continues to intensify. AI continues to be high on the list of big tech companies, and discussions have gone toward pacing spending on AI, especially data centers. Doug believes decisions could adversely impact semiconductor companies. A cooldown on data centers will weigh heavily on semiconductor companies He explained that the downswing will not have to last long for it to start having an adverse impact on the industry. In 2024, tech firms intensified efforts to improve AI infrastructure such as data centers. “Any slowdown in the data center buildout is going to have big reverberations in the supply chain.” Lefever. Tech firms like Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta have invested huge amounts – billions of dollars – into AI infrastructure, generating both excitement and apprehension on Wall Street. It is estimated that hyperscalers would have spent as much as about $222 billion on AI chips and data centers by the end of this year. The investments are meant to run the emerging technology and enable the firms to remain ahead of the race for AI supremacy. While AI spending is expected to continue rising, there are also concerns from industry watchers who are anxious about whether this spending can last, particularly if the technology fails to live up to the hype. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has warned the industry about overspending on AI, which he described earlier this month as a “race to the bottom.” “While there is a big movement of a lot of companies into these kind of public clouds, I think that we have to be careful exactly how much we’re investing,” explained Benioff. In September this year, the overspending fears had a knock-on effect on the performance of key semiconductor firms. Lefever has good reasons for paying attention to industry trends. According to Business Insider , enthusiasm for AI has made semiconductors increasingly complex, which has also boosted demand for Advantest’s products. The report further indicates that ADRs on the Tokyo-based stock are up 71.32% this year as a result. “I don’t like to use the word bubble because it implies that it’s going to go away, but there will be cycles,” Lefever told the Financial Times . “When that next cycle comes . . . it could be pretty vicious,” added Lefever. Smartphones could save the day However, Lefever feels it’s not all doom and gloom for semiconductor companies in the event that tech firms downsize their spending on data centers. AI-enabled smartphones could save the day for the industry, according to Lefever. “Everyone is holding their breath, waiting for the killer app with the AI handsets . . . if that happens and people start replacing their phones, it’s going to be crazy,” Lefever said. According to Business Insider, some Wall Street analysts are also equally upbeat about AI smartphones, a consideration that is reportedly already trickling into the price targets. For instance, Wedbush Securities on Thursday raised its target price on Apple to $325. Wedbush cited the high expectations around Apple Intelligence, Apple’s AI software that is accessible on new iPhone products. “This will be a multi-year AI journey that will define the future for Apple with its next generation chip architecture, hardware releases, and future iPhone models built around the AI foundation that many consumers will ultimately embrace,” analyst Dan Ives said. According to the 2025 Mobile Outlook report, the mobile device market is expected to continue transforming in 2025, with generative AI promising to reignite consumer demand. The report further states that Google and Apple’s introduction of AI-driven hardware and services is expected to impact the silicon ecosystem and the overall market.

The crypto markets have shown signs of uncertainty in recent weeks following the Federal Reserve's hawkish posture heading into 2025. While the market offered hopes of a recovery with a Christmas Day rally , an ensuing sharp correction on Boxing Day again stirred doubts. Amid the uncertainty, leading crypto analytics platform Santiment Feed has argued that there is hope to be found in the activity of a closely watched class of crypto investors.Whales Preparing to Accumulate?On Christmas day, December 25, 2024, Bitcoin rallied to $99,900 amid a 7% jump from Christmas Eve lows of $93,500 amid a Fed-led slump. But any hopes that a recovery from the recent market slump was underway were likely short-lived.Notably, on Boxing Day, December 26, the asset shed most of its Christmas gains to trade as low as $95,000, dragging the broader crypto market down with it. Despite the wild swings, Santiment Feed has maintained that the crypto market still has bullish undercurrents, citing whale activity.In an X post on Friday, December 27, the firm noted that this class of crypto investors with extensive holdings were increasingly moving stablecoins to exchanges following the most recent dip, per its top centralized exchange deposit dashboard, presumably to load up on more crypto assets.

The analyst expressed this view, citing capital inflows into the market.Young Ju stressed that while news of whale accumulation may no longer send shockwaves through the crypto space as they did two to three years ago, the moves offered confirmation that the market was not yet in a bubble.He contended that a bubble is when prices are significantly higher than the capital flowing into a market. On the contrary, he noted that $7 billion poured into crypto markets weekly, citing on-chain data.The CryptoQuant Chief further asserted that Bitcoin appeared far from its cycle top, pointing to the asset's ""true"" market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio.

On December 27, 2024, while the overall cryptocurrency market struggles to gain momentum including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP, GMT has outperformed all major assets with a significant 55% upside momentum. GTM Price Momentum At press time, GMT is trading near $0.21 and has experienced an upside momentum of over 55% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume has skyrocketed by 1,350%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors amid an ongoing bull run. The significant upside momentum can be attributed to its bullish price action, a recent breakout, and continuous accumulation by whales. Source: Coinglass GMT Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, GMT recently broke out of a consolidation zone where whales had significantly accumulated tokens. However, while GMT initially broke out of the zone yesterday, it failed to sustain above it. Despite this, strong trader interest and a notable rise in long positions have propelled GMT by 55%. Source: Trading View With this notable upside momentum, GMT has reached a crucial resistance level, where it previously faced selling pressure and a price decline. However, this time, the sentiment appears different as traders and long-term holders continue to bet on the altcoin, potentially helping it break through the strong hurdle near $0.214. Based on the recent price action, if GMT breaches the recent resistance level and closes a daily candle above $0.22, it could soar by 85% to reach the $0.40 mark in the future. However, during the rally, a hurdle at the $0.25 level could pose challenges for the altcoin. GMT Open Interest Soars by 210% According to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass , GMT open interest has surged by 210% in the past 24 hours, indicating the formation of new positions by traders. Additionally, long-term holders who recently accumulated GMT tokens during the consolidation phase appear to be dumping them onto exchanges, as reported by Coinglass data. Data from GMT spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed a significant inflow of $1.02 million worth of GMT, indicating token dumping.

Previously, the Supreme Court of Montenegro had ruled that the legal conditions for extraditing Do Kwon were met, following extradition requests from both South Korea and the United States. Extradition Request To South Korea Rejected Notably, the Ministry of Justice reviewed the Supreme Court’s verdict and considered factors such as the severity of the criminal acts, the location of the offense, the order of extradition requests, the citizenship of Do Kwon, the possibility of further extradition, and other relevant circumstances. “In view of the above, it was concluded that most of the criteria provided by the law support the request for extradition by the competent authorities of the United States of America, and the Minister of Justice issued a decision allowing the extradition of Kwon Do Hyeong to the United States to the United States, and at the same time refuses extradition to the Republic of Korea,” the Ministry of Justice noted in a statement. For context, the US and South Korean authorities have been investigating Do Kwon for his role in one of the biggest disasters in cryptocurrency history. In May 2022, the value of two cryptocurrencies he created, TerraUSD and Luna, dropped, wiping $40 billion from the cryptocurrency market which set off a chain reaction that pushed other digital crypto companies into bankruptcy. The investigation concluded that Do Kwon had lied to investors and was suspected of hiding wealth. Do Kwon and his business partner Han Chang-Joon were arrested on March 23, 2023, at Podgorica Airport while trying to fly to Dubai using forged passports. He was sentenced to four months in prison in Montenegro for document falsification. After serving his sentence, U.S. and South Korean authorities began pursuing extradition. Upon his release from Spuž prison on March 23, Montenegrin police transferred Do Kwon to the Foreigners’ Reception Center, where he will remain until the extradition process is finalized.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/justice-minister-of-montenegro-signs-extradition-order-for-do-kwon-to-the-united-states/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Two months after BTC reserves on Binance slumped, Bitcoin saw a parabolic 90% rally just two months later in March. Long-Term Holding Gains Traction CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost noted in a Dec. 25 note that Binance’s BTC reserves recently dropped below 570,000 BTC — the lowest level since January of this year. Historically, falling exchange reserves indicate that holders are moving their Bitcoin holdings to cold storage as they are incredibly bullish about the asset’s price in the long term rather than keeping them on exchanges for selling in the short term. Binance’s BTC reserves fell to a similar level in January , whichpreceded a 90% bull run two months later, with the alpha cryptocurrency hitting a record high of $73,737 on March 13. “When periods of withdrawals occur, it is often a sign of positive momentum building in the market,” Darkfost wrote. Time For Another 90% BTC Price Surge? Bitcoin appeared set to recapture the $100,000 mark after rallying past $99,400 on December 24 just before Christmas Day. The upsurge, however, stalled at around $99,886 on Thursday, and BTC has since nosedived to sub-$96,000. At press time, Bitcoin is trading for $96,696 per coin, according to CoinGecko data. Less than a week ago, the benchmark cryptocurrency was valued at a whopping $108,000, hitting a historic price as the holiday season neared. Nonetheless, a hawkish Federal Reserve dented the asset’s rally by expressing a more cautious approach to rate cuts in 2025. However, Bitcoin is expected to retake the six-figure price tag amid Donald Trump’s imminent presidential inauguration on Jan. 20, which is considered a bullish event for crypto regulations in the US. Many are waiting to see whether Trump will establish a national Bitcoin reserve. Meanwhile, if history repeats itself as predicted by CryptoQuant’s Darkfost, BTC could soar to as high as the $185,000 price point in the coming months from its current levels.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-reserves-on-binance-fall-to-level-that-sparked-90-btc-rally-in-march-will-history-repeat/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

Still, investors continue to believe in the potential of this layer-one blockchain, as indicated by a significant amount of capital that has been poured into the token since September 2023. According to on-chain activity traced by Glassnode , net inflows during this period of approximately 15 months amounted to $776 million. We observe that #Solana has consistently maintained a positive net capital inflow since early September 2023, with only minor outflows during this period. This sustained influx of liquidity has assisted in stimulating growth and price appreciation, achieving a remarkable peak… pic.twitter.com/ypuwTdhrmc — glassnode (@glassnode) December 24, 2024 A significant portion of these funds could come from meme coins, as this segment of the crypto market has been growing rapidly. Most developers have relied on the Solana blockchain to mint these tokens. So far this year, the network’s native token—$ SOL—has delivered gains of 72.7%, surpassing its competitor in the smart contracts space, Ethereum, which saw gains of only 45.5% during this period. Meanwhile, the token has underperformed Bitcoin ($BTC) during this period. This suggests to analysts that $SOL could experience further upside later in this bull cycle when the alt-coin season starts. The popularity of meme coins has been one of the sector’s most important catalysts, as Ethereum lagged behind Solana in terms of transaction costs and execution speed. Scalability issues have plagued the network created by Vitalik Buterin for years, and Solana stepped up to fill the gap at a crucial time when these ‘internet jokes’ started to gain traction among investors. In line with what is seen on-chain, the latest report from CoinShares indicates that exchange-traded products (ETPs) and funds that invest in Solana have poured $80 million on this digital asset so far this year. Solana’s Bull Flag is Still in Play After Bull Trap Since late November, a bullish pattern has been unfolding that could propel the price of Solana ($SOL) to new heights. This technical setup is called a bull flag and consists of an initial uptrend, followed by a brief pullback that ends up with a spike above the uptrend’s former peak. On 21 December, the price action broke below the lower end of the flag but rapidly recovered and moved back to its body. In technical terms, this kind of move is commonly known as a bull trap. When this happens, traders push the price downwards until they flush out many long positions by triggering their stop-loss orders. That bull trap appears to have worked as $SOL recorded three consecutive days of price upticks. Even though that streak ended today, the price is now back in the flag’s body, which means the pattern is still in play. If subsequent bullish moves push the price above the flag’s upper bound – located at around $200 – chances are that the setup will unfold as expected, with a significant spike in Solana’s price in the near term. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved close to the oversold area, which means that this pullback could soon exhaust its ammunition. Overall, the outlook for the Solana blockchain and $SOL token is bullish. Investors’ interest in the ecosystem and its native token continues to be strong, as indicated by the significant inflows that have come their way since this year started. If the pattern is confirmed, the first target for Solana based on the flag’s pole size would be $300 per coin. This L2 Network is Raising Millions from Investors to Solve Solana’s Congestion Issues A project called Solaxy is attracting investors’ attention lately as it solves a major issue that could prevent the Solana network from further beating Ethereum at its own game. https://twitter.com/SOLAXYTOKEN/status/1871592567126806681 In just a few days, the presale of its native token, $SOLX, has raised $5.8 million as Solaxy’s value proposition has attracted thousands of early buyers. Solaxy bundles transactions offline and sends them to the Solana network as a single transaction to alleviate the network’s congestion. Coinsult has audited the protocol’s code to ensure that it has no major flaws. Currently, $SOLX is being offered at a discounted price of $0.00158. This offer expires in less than 18 hours. Once that period ends, the price will increase until the project raises its funding target. To buy $SOLX, visit the Solaxy website and connect your preferred crypto wallet. You can convert $USDT, $ETH, or $BNB to $SOLX or buy it with a bank card. Don’t miss the chance to own this promising token at this attractive price.

38186052,https://finbold.com/?p=223466,1735309902,Bitcoin adds $1.1 trillion in 2024,"In recent weeks, much has been said about the wealth erased from various cryptocurrencies’ valuation. For example, in the seven days leading up to December 24 – and despite the rally on the day – Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) valuation collapsed by nearly $200 billion . Still, for all the frustration emerging from the apparent cancellation of the ‘Santa Claus’ rally, 2024 remains an exceptionally strong year across the board, with the many coins and tokens being overwhelming winners in the last 12 months. Bitcoin up more than $1 trillion in 2024 Bitcoin itself, despite erasing approximately $200 billion in the last ten or so days, remains more than $1 trillion more valuable as an asset at press time on December 27 than it was on January 1. Specifically, data retrieved by Finbold from CoinMarketCap reveals that at the start of the now-outgoing year, BTC’s market cap stood at $828 billion, while at press time, it is as high as $1.91 trillion. BTC 12-month market cap chart with January 1 valuation marked. Source: CoinMarketCap The situation is very similar for digital assets as a whole. TradingView data shows the total cryptocurrency valuation on January 1 as $1.67 trillion and reveals that, on December 27, it is at $3.27 trillion – a $1.6 trillion difference. Total cryptocurrency market cap, YTD chart. Source: TradingView Still, the slightly less encouraging facet of the chart is that it simultaneously means that Bitcoin’s dominance among coins and tokens remains significant, as BTC accounts for approximately two-thirds of the growth. On the flip side, this fact could bolster the ‘alt season’ narrative for 2025 as it could hint that other cryptocurrencies are somewhat undervalued. Could 2025 be as strong for cryptocurrencies as 2024? Finally, it is worth pointing out that for the successes of 2024 – and stagnation in the year’s final month – predictions for the new year remain exceedingly bullish. Though Bitcoin has again taken center stage with 12-month price targets running as high as $800,000 , albeit with a rising consensus that the next move for BTC could be a plunge toward $70,000 or even $60,000 , it is far from the only digital asset investors are bullish about. XRP , for example, is seen as boating a particularly grand growth protection as it appears poised to fully clear the regulatory roadblocks with some on-chain analysts – with Ali Martinez on X being, perhaps, the most prominent – seeing a potential rally to as high as $48 : 2,100% above the press time prices at $2.18.

38186194,https://blockworks.co/news/crypto-venture-capital-18b-in-2025,1735309800,Crypto venture capital could hit more than $18B in 2025,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . We’ve written about some pretty bullish calls on Empire (some of which you’ll find below). Why not keep that trend going? So far this year, crypto venture capital looked a lot like a roller coaster. Third-quarter activity was slightly down, PitchBook’s Robert Le told me, but that could be associated with the summer lull. “There was a lot of momentum and positive sentiment at the beginning of the year, and then … around the summer time … there was a slowdown in investments. And I think the thing with … the crypto native VCs who are supposed to … only invest in crypto, they really slowed down their investments. They didn’t really pick up their investments, even the ones that have, you know, a lot of dry powder in their funds,” Le said. After the election, however, it seems activity has picked back up. Unfortunately, though, we don’t have the data yet to back up that observation. But Le thinks that, based on anecdotal evidence, we could see an uptick in this final quarter. Now here’s the really juicy part: Le thinks we could be in for quite a year in venture activity. His prediction is that we could see over $18 billion in venture investments, with “multiple $5 billion quarters.” Let’s just put that figure in perspective: 2023 overall saw roughly $9 or so billion. This year’s shaping up to look like it’ll land something around $11 billion, if not slightly over. Of those totals, we saw between $2 billion and $2.5 billion per quarter, Le added. And part of that is going to come from the generalist VC firms, which he expects to come back to crypto next year. As for some specific areas prime for investment, Le thinks that the crypto x AI narrative will stay hot after taking off earlier this year. He admitted that he initially thought the crypto x AI narrative was just a mishmash of buzzwords. But the use cases this year have convinced him that there are real business applications there. “As the AI ecosystem grows bigger … some of the glaring issues you see in AI become more obvious. And when that happens, you’re going to see opportunistic crypto companies come in and say, ‘Look [this is the] crypto answer to this AI” problem, Le said.

Potts arrived at this conclusion after analyzing Dogecoin's historical growth patterns during the fourth year of its four-year market cycles. Sharing his analysis on social media platform X, Potts highlighted how Dogecoin’s performance in previous cycles indicates a potential 37x increase during the next major growth phase.Historical Data Suggests Consistency for DogecoinPotts’ analysis centers around DOGE's price action during the fourth year of each market cycle. In the first cycle, Year 4, being 2017, saw DOGE rise from $0.00023 to $0.00851, marking a 37x increase. In the second cycle, Year 4, which was 2021, saw DOGE grow from $0.00460 to $0.17064, again achieving a 37x increase. With the fourth year of the ongoing cycle approaching in 2025, Potts predicts a similar outcome.According to his projection, if 2024 ends with a Dogecoin price of around $0.315, it could reach $11.65 by the end of 2025. As of now, Dogecoin is trading at $0.3201, reflecting a 1.1% increase over the past 24 hours. Dogecoin chart by Ðima James Potts Potts' analysis assumes that historical trends will continue, with Dogecoin's price multiplying by 37x from its starting point for the year. Meanwhile, he emphasized that the $11.65 target is not a peak price. Instead, he sees it as a projected year-end price, leaving room for potentially higher values throughout 2025.Indeed, other market analysts have set even more ambitious price targets for Dogecoin’s peak during this cycle.Dogecoin Could Reach $30 by 2025?In a separate analysis, market watcher Tardigrade highlighted how Dogecoin could rally to $30 by next year. He pointed to Dogecoin’s double-bottom formations during bear markets and subsequent breakouts.For instance, after a 3,366% rise in early 2021, Dogecoin consolidated before surging another 677%. Tardigrade expects a similar pattern to unfold, with Dogecoin potentially reaching $30.In an updated analysis, Tardigrade noted that Dogecoin follows the ""Power of Three (PO3)"" pattern, consisting of accumulation, manipulation, and distribution phases. After consolidating from mid-November to December, Dogecoin entered a manipulation phase with a crash on December 20, followed by a rebound. Tardigrade suggests Dogecoin is now in the distribution phase, with the potential for a dramatic price rise to break $1 in the short term and reach $30 in the long term.Other analysts who agree with the $30 price target, based on historical patterns, have suggested this milestone could be reached by May 2025.",POSITIVE,DOGE,DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/27/analyst-says-dogecoin-to-register-at-least-37x-surge-in-2025/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=analyst-says-dogecoin-to-register-at-least-37x-surge-in-2025,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
38185909,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633991,1735309360,Confirmed Bitcoin payments per day hit yearly lows – Illiquidity hits BTC whales,"Daily confirmed Bitcoin payments fell to a yearly low on December 26, a pattern typical of the holiday season’s market illiquidity. Blockchain.com data revealed that confirmed Bitcoin transactions sank to 623,434, the lowest point in 2024. Confirmed BTC payments are transactions successfully added to the blockchain, making them immutable. The metric is often used to gauge activity and reflect on investor engagement levels within the Bitcoin network. The December 26 figures mark a stark contrast to December 17, when Bitcoin’s all-time high price of $108,000 prompted over 857,000 confirmed payments, 37% more than the recent low. Bitcoin chart patterns and analyst insights Looking at Blockchain.com’s chart , Bitcoin payments’ highs and lows this month typically followed the trend of the crypto’s price. Payments peaked when BTC hit its all-time high value of $108,000 around December 17 and 18 but fell when the price retreated downwards to lows of $94,000. In the last 30 days, the highest number of BTC recipients was seen at the end of November, clocking almost 1.2 million. At the time, the largest crypto by market cap was changing hands at around $96,000, and it seemed that the market had a lot of FOMO as investors were anticipating the coin could reach $100,000 soon. BTC confirmed payments per day in December. Source: Blockchain.com Given the low tally in payments, crypto enthusiasts could be stocking up on BTC, hoping it will surge even higher than the November-December price rally. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s social sentiment has declined, with the ratio of positive to negative comments dropping to 4:5, the lowest sentiment level of the year. Despite BTC maintaining a price above $95,000, retail traders have expressed heightened pessimism. Contrarian analysts suggest such periods of fear could precede a price rally, as markets often move opposite to retail sentiment. Bullish scenarios for 2025 Bitcoin, which peaked at $108,000 on December 17, has since dropped over 10%, currently trading around $97,150. Some analysts believe the cryptocurrency may recover above $100,000, citing historical patterns that hint at a potential rebound. Elja Boom, a prominent crypto analyst, highlighted fractal patterns on the chart that suggest upward momentum. However, contrasting views from Rekt Capital indicate the current correction could persist for another week, drawing parallels to similar scenarios in 2017 and 2021. On December 26, market technician Aksel Kibar shared an analysis on X, outlining Bitcoin’s potential price targets and warning of a possible head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern, a classic indicator of an uptrend reversal. According to Kibar, Bitcoin’s failure to reclaim the $100,000 support level has opened downside targets ranging from $90,000 to the mid-$60,000 range. If the pattern acts as a H&S top, the price target is at 80K. This can be the pullback to the broadening pattern that completed with a breakout above 73.7K. $BTCUSD https://t.co/aWeNdWVkMz pic.twitter.com/QbGi08AfcH — Aksel Kibar, CMT (@TechCharts) December 26, 2024 Kibar’s analysis focused on the likelihood of a short-term H&S top forming within Bitcoin’s broader market structure. He explained that if the pattern fully develops, the price could drop to $80,000. This potential decline aligns with a pullback to Bitcoin’s broadening chart pattern breakout, which occurred above $73,700. In his X post, Kibar noted, “Breakout from the broadening chart pattern that completed on $BTCUSD… the pullback can take place with a possible short-term H&S top. (IF) the right shoulder becomes better defined…” Further analysis by Kibar outlined how low BTC could fall under this scenario. However, he emphasized that market responses suggest a less severe correction than the H&S pattern might imply. This, in turn, bolsters his position on the possibility of a moderate pullback rather than a steep decline.

38185793,https://finbold.com/?p=223435,1735309359,"ChatGPT builds a $1,000 crypto portfolio for 2025","The wider cryptocurrency market entered a bull run following the conclusion of the United States presidential election in November. However, the surge hit its first speed bump quite quickly — in mid-December, the Federal Reserve announced that it would put fewer rate cuts in place in 2025 than was originally expected. Bitcoin ( BTC ) saw prices crash from an all-time high (ATH) of roughly $106,000 to just $92,000, and altcoins predictably followed suit. December 20 turned out to be the worst day, with as much as $310 billion exiting the market. However, by press time, the price of Bitcoin had recovered to $96,551. While analysts mostly remain bullish, there is an increasing number of voices that are now predicting a short-term correction . With these new developments in mind, Finbold has consulted OpenAI’s most advanced large language model (LLM) to construct a $1,000 cryptocurrency portfolio for the coming year. Blue-chip cryptocurrencies (70%) A vast majority of GPT’s proposed portfolio is dedicated to blue-chip cryptocurrencies — namely, Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ). With an initial balance of $1,000, the AI model would invest $700 in two flagship digital assets. In the case of Bitcoin, which accounts for 40% of the entire portfolio, ChatGPT cited increasing institutional adoption , widespread global demand, and increasingly recognized utility as a store of value and hedge against inflation as bullish catalysts.

Source: OpenAI On the other hand, 30% of the portfolio was allocated to Ethereum, owing to its already dominant and expanding ecosystem, widespread adoption by enterprises, and robust development community. ChatGPT’s reasoning for picking ETH. Source: OpenAI High-potential altcoins (25%) Surprisingly enough, ChatGPT only allocated a quarter of the portfolio — 25%, to altcoins. Readers should note that a wide variety of cryptocurrency analysts, such as Michaël van de Poppe, predict that altcoins will outperform BTC in 2025. The AI model set a 10% allocation for Solana ( SOL ). An active and rapidly growing developer base, fast and affordable transactions, and a wide variety of use cases were singled out as tailwinds. ChatGPT’s reasoning for picking SOL. Source: OpenAI Up next, Polygon ( MATIC ) accounts for the same proportion of ChatGPT’s portfolio, at 10%. As Ethereum’s go-to scaling solution, Polygon is uniquely positioned to benefit from the rise of one of the cryptocurrency market’s most notable listings and has already secured numerous strategic partnerships with major enterprises.

ChatGPT’s reasoning for picking ARB. Source: OpenAI Stablecoins (5%) Last but not least, ChatGPT suggested that investors should set aside 5% of their portfolio for stablecoins — preferably Tether ( USDT ) or USD coin ( USDC ). Unlike the other assets that were picked, the role of these stablecoins is not to secure returns — rather, this allocation is meant to provide a degree of stability to the portfolio, as well as the option to take advantage of any opportunities that might pop up over the course of 2025. ChatGPT’s reasoning for picking stablecoins. Source: OpenAI As interesting as the AI model’s outputs are — they can certainly provide some degree of insight, investors should remember that the responses given by ChatGPT cannot serve as a suitable substitute for due diligence and personal research. Perhaps more importantly, ChatGPT cannot account for personal circumstances — and while this portfolio does appear to be broadly applicable, readers should always be wary of ‘one size fits all’ solutions when it comes to investing.

In a December 26 post shared on X, the firm revealed the purchase was made at an average price of $96,556.53 per BTC. KULR’s Bitcoin Treasury Strategy An accompanying press release revealed that the buy was the first in a series of planned purchases as part of the New York Stock Exchange-listed company’s broader financial strategy. In the statement, KULR also noted that it has partnered with Coinbase Prime to receive institutional and self-custodial wallet services for its BTC and to be supplied with USDC. The firm first announced its Bitcoin treasury strategy on December 4, outlining plans to allocate up to 90% of its surplus cash into the cryptocurrency. KULR Chairman and CEO Michael Mo highlighted the company’s belief in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, saying: “We believe the growing global acceptance of Bitcoin is still in its early stages. Companies, financial institutions, governments, and the capital markets are recognizing and incorporating blockchain technology, and specifically, BTC, into their overall economic toolkits.” He further elaborated on the cryptocurrency’s unique characteristics, describing it as a safeguard against inflationary, geopolitical, and macroeconomic challenges while offering long-term appreciation. The executive expressed confidence that this strategy would strengthen KULR’s financial position, expand operations, and establish a resilient financial reserve. The company specializes in energy storage and management solutions. According to Google Finance data, its stock price responded positively to the news, rising by 40.35% over the last 24 hours. Corporate Adoption of Bitcoin Gains Momentum KULR’s Bitcoin acquisition is part of a broader trend of companies embracing crypto as a key component of their financial strategies. Recently, Rumble, the popular online video streaming platform, announced plans to allocate some of its surplus cash into the number one virtual currency. In line with this, the company has set a target of up to $20 million for its BTC investments. Similarly, Genius Group, a firm focused on artificial intelligence, disclosed a $4 million Bitcoin purchase, bringing its stack to 153 coins. This was after the company revealed plans to embrace a “Bitcoin-first” strategy, allocating 90% or more of its reserves to the trillion-dollar cryptocurrency to capitalize on its potential as a long-term store of value. Other companies, including Semler Scientific and Japan’s Metaplanet, have expanded their holdings to leverage Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. MicroStrategy, which pioneered the strategy, remains the largest holder of the asset among publicly traded companies, with its stash of 444,262 BTC worth an estimated $42.8 billion at current prices.

Popcat ( POPCAT ) price has plunged by over 62% from its highest level this year, pushing its market cap to $762 million. It has moved from being the second-biggest Solana meme coin into the sixth after being passed by Pudgy Penguins, Dogwifhat, Fartcoin, and ai16z. Popcat price has crashed as smart money investors continued selling their holdings. According to Nansen, the number of smart money investors holding the token has dropped from over 70 to 30. Tokens held by these investors have also moved from 2.10 billion in May to 2.07 billion today. Popcat smart money investors | Source: Nansen There are also signs that the number of Popcat tokens on exchanges has continued rising, a sign that investors are selling. These tokens have risen by 2.77% in the last seven days to over 248.32 million. A likely reason for this plunge is that the Solana meme coin industry has been very vibrant, with new tokens regularly going viral. The most recent of them was Pudgy Penguins , which has become the second-biggest Solana meme coin. Before that, there was Peanut the Squirrel, Goatseus Maximus, and Moo Deng.

Analysts believe these inflows are a bullish sign, suggesting that traders and institutional players are preparing for potential market moves. Are whales preparing to accumulate crypto assets? The high market activity in stablecoin inflows seemingly coincides with a fall in exchange reserves on cryptos like Bitcoin. According to data from CryptoQuant, spot Bitcoin exchange reserves saw a 5% downtick in the last 30 days, which could mean investors are planning to take up holding positions.

A surge in taker buy volume often points to heightened interest from traders and increasing buying pressure, a trend typically favorable for prices. On Binance, Bitcoin’s taker buy volume has been on the rise between November 1 and December 25, forming higher lows over this period. Binance’s Bitcoin taker buy volume in December. Source: CryptoQuant This uptrend signals a growing demand for Bitcoin, further suggesting that buying pressure is intensifying, which could support a positive price movement in the near future. Bitcoin, which saw a temporary dip following its failure to participate in the traditional “Santa Claus rally,” remains around the $96,000 mark. Despite the pullback, Bitcoin’s on-chain metrics are showing signs of increased buying pressure, particularly on centralized exchange platforms. Institutional interest in Bitcoin also appears to be on the rise, following a brief period of outflows from Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). According to Farside Investors, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a net inflow of $475.2 million on Thursday, reversing a four-day streak of outflows prior to the holiday. Altcoins experience mixed performance While Bitcoin’s performance remains the focal point, altcoins have also seen some movement. On Christmas Day, several major altcoins posted slight gains. Ethereum rose close to $3,500, marking a 2% increase, while XRP jumped to $2.30, also reflecting a similar upward trend. Other altcoins such as BNB, ADA, TRX, and LINK saw modest increases of around 2% each. However, the post-Christmas correction hit the broader market hard. Ethereum, after peaking near $3,500, has dropped to the $3,400 level, reflecting a 1% daily decline. XRP, Dogecoin, Solana, and others experienced similar setbacks. Cryptocurrencies like ADA, AVAX, LINK, SHIB, HBAR, XLM, and DOT registered more substantial losses, with some falling by up to 9% on Thursday. AAVE, ONDO, and HYPE have seen even steeper declines, plummeting by 10%. Meanwhile, the cumulative market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has experienced a significant pullback. On December 25, the total market cap stood at $3.6 trillion, but by the end of the following day, it had dropped to $3.46 trillion, a decrease of over $100 billion, per Coingecko’s recent updates .

Here Are the Details,"Leading cryptocurrency exchange Bitget has announced a major plan to burn 40% of the total supply of its native token, equivalent to 800 million BGB tokens worth approximately $6.8 billion. Bitget Announces Major Token Burn and Quarterly Buyback Plan The initiative involves the launch of a quarterly token burn starting in 2025, funded by 20% of the profits from the exchange’s operations and related crypto wallet services. This approach mirrors strategies used by other major exchanges, including Binance, to prop up token value and produce a deflationary effect. The announcement comes after Bitget’s decision to merge its Bitget Wallet Token (BWB) with Bitget Token (BGB), creating a unified ecosystem token for both its centralized exchange and wallet services. The merger will not change the total BGB supply and the exchange rate will be set at 11.68 BWB / 1 BGB, ensuring a smooth transition for users. Updated Whitepaper and Future Plans Alongside the burn announcement, Bitget released an updated BGB whitepaper outlining the token’s evolving role within its ecosystem. The planned burn and token merger underscore Bitget’s commitment to enhancing BGB’s utility and value proposition for its users.

38185143,https://crypto.news/?p=14321942,1735308060,Crypto tech projects shouldn’t settle for shallow marketing | Opinion,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. Crypto is a highly technical, engineering-led category built by people who are solving really hard math, cryptography, software engineering, and logical problems. However, as the industry prepares itself for a wave of optimism and friendly regulation in 2025, the projects that rest on their technical laurels will be doing themselves a disservice. You might also like: The crypto marketing trap: Hiring crypto experts can backfire | Opinion I don’t blame technical crypto teams for being skeptical of marketing. In this category, you’ll come across many self-branded “web3” or “crypto” marketers who are often promoting a kind of marketing that is not rooted in fundamentals or a comprehensive strategy. Instead, they’re usually signaling a close association with specific crypto projects or kinds of tactics, such as paying key opinion leaders (KOLs), managing influencers, knowing how to shitpost on X, or having a pulse on the crypto meme-du-jour. (To be fair, there’s a place for all of that.) Crypto marketing is different and comes with unique challenges But these “crypto marketers” are also onto something. They’re onto the fact that crypto is not a typical industry and that it requires understanding a unique set of dynamics not found in traditional markets. Since 2021, at Blokhaus, we have supported a range of crypto clients, from layer-1 to layer-2, DeFi protocols, and web3 gaming and social apps. We’ve seen firsthand the challenges facing these projects and the lack of marketing infrastructure, talent, and support that prevents them from reaching their potential. It’s a complex landscape that very few individuals and teams are able to navigate effectively. Crypto projects looking to stand out in what is sure to be a noisy year ahead should be ready to step up their marketing efforts and not settle for shallow tactics. When onboarding marketing roles or agency teams to support your project, here are some key skills you should be looking for: 1. The ability to navigate decentralized ecosystems effectively and be a key point of integration Crypto ecosystems operate fundamentally differently than other sectors. Projects often have decentralized global teams, distinct organizations driving aspects of governance, tech, and business development, and vibrant communities that are not just consumers but active participants in the ecosystem’s evolution. When marketers come to crypto from traditional, centralized organizations, they need a major mindset shift. Rather than dictating and executing a top-down strategy, marketing in a decentralized setting requires the ability to listen, observe, synthesize, and reflect ideas back out into the world that was already there to begin with. In practice, this means you should look for marketing talent who can maintain strong relationships and lines of communication with a multitude of community organizations, ecosystem projects, and stakeholders. Your marketing team should become a key function for integration and alignment and be able to see connections that translate into insights for technical teams—who might be too busy building in decentralized silos to see the big picture. 2. The ability to deeply understand the tech while helping you crystallize the story It’s no mystery why crypto has not yet achieved mainstream adoption—there is little else for the average consumer to do other than speculate on the potential success of various projects. The crypto category is still working out the plumbing (layers and layers and layers of plumbing) of an entirely new infrastructure. Marketers in crypto need to be skilled in a very important way: they need to understand the tech with enough depth and nuance to devise tactics for a range of audiences, from experienced developers to crypto-curious consumers. And they need to be able to do this while helping technical teams crystallize a big-picture vision and story. I encourage crypto teams to view marketing not as a set of nice-to-haves or gimmicks but as an essential function that extends and completes the engineering cycle. Marketing isn’t just about getting clicks and eyeballs; it’s about building a product that fulfills market desires, which requires a continuous feedback loop between developers and marketers. 3. The ability to move as fast as the industry requires while getting out of ‘react’ mode Crypto is volatile and fast-moving, and as a result, many teams in the category are in a constant state of reactivity—understandably so. But it’s one thing to be nimble enough to react and another to not have a clear strategy. It’s also really hard to get away from the pressure of “price goes up,” which leads to the industry’s overreliance on KOLs or influencers to shill tokens. These tactics are not a substitute for a robust marketing strategy centered on solving problems and driving meaningful audience engagement and activity. Effective marketing requires a shift away from token-centric narratives and towards building sustainable ecosystems that users care about. Crypto teams should avoid being so fixated on short-term token price increases that they forget to build a solid strategy that sustains them for the long term. Often, these projects’ technical roadmaps are years long, acknowledging the time and effort required to achieve their engineering vision—this same thinking should be applied to marketing efforts. Yes, the best tech still needs good marketing For crypto to achieve mainstream adoption, marketing must not be viewed as a token price booster or an afterthought. It needs to be an integral component of the process, driving innovation, user adoption, and long-term growth. The technical teams that succeed in breaking through the noise of 2025 and beyond will be the ones that invest in marketing as a strategic function, not a peripheral activity. And while it is certainly challenging to find talent and teams that are as comfortable engaging in technical debates about rollup frameworks as they are making beautiful creative assets, they are out there.

38185097,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=114884,1735308021,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Drops to 74, Enters the ‘Greed’ Zone","Crypto Fear & Greed Index Drops to 74, Enters the ‘Greed’ Zone The cryptocurrency market sentiment has shifted, as the Crypto Fear & Greed Index stands at 74, down from 79 the previous day. This marks a movement from the “Extreme Greed” zone into the “Greed” zone, signaling a recalibration of investor sentiment amid subtle market shifts. Provided by Alternative, a software development platform, this metric remains a key tool for gauging the emotions driving the volatile crypto market. What Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a numerical representation of market sentiment, ranging from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed). It combines multiple data points to provide insights into whether the market is overly cautious or excessively exuberant. This widely used metric evaluates six core factors, each contributing to the overall score: Volatility (25%) : Measures market stability or turbulence. Market Momentum/Volume (25%) : Tracks trading activity and price momentum. Social Media (15%) : Analyzes mentions, engagement, and sentiment on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%) : Gathers opinions from market participants. Bitcoin Dominance (10%) : Reflects the percentage of market capitalization held by Bitcoin compared to other cryptocurrencies. Google Trends (10%) : Considers search interest related to crypto terms and keywords. Significance of Dropping to 74 The five-point drop to 74 moves the index from the “Extreme Greed” zone to the “Greed” zone, reflecting a subtle cooling in market enthusiasm. This shift, while not drastic, may suggest increasing caution among investors. Greed Zone : A level of 74 indicates sustained optimism but hints that exuberance may be leveling off. Market Implications : When greed dominates, prices often inflate, potentially leading to corrections as traders lock in profits. Analyzing the Factors Behind the Shift The index’s adjustment reflects real-time changes in the six underlying metrics: 1. Volatility A decrease in extreme price swings could have contributed to a lower score. Stable markets often temper the index, even during bullish phases. 2. Market Momentum and Volume A dip in trading volumes or slowing price momentum across major cryptocurrencies could signal declining enthusiasm, reducing the overall score. 3. Social Media Sentiment A shift in the tone of social media discussions, from overwhelmingly positive to more tempered, may reflect investor caution. 4. Surveys and Community Sentiment Surveys capturing investor outlook may indicate growing uncertainty, even in an environment of broader market gains. 5. Bitcoin Dominance Fluctuations in Bitcoin’s dominance over the total crypto market capitalization could signal shifting focus towards altcoins, impacting the index. 6. Google Trends Lower search interest in cryptocurrency-related topics may suggest a cooling of retail investor excitement. What Does This Mean for Traders and Investors? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a compass for navigating the often-irrational movements of the crypto market. Here’s what the shift means: Cautious Optimism : The “Greed” zone reflects positive sentiment but warns of potential price corrections. Risk Management : Traders may consider adjusting stop-loss levels and diversifying portfolios to hedge against volatility. Market Timing : A drop from “Extreme Greed” can signal the beginning of a consolidation phase, potentially opening entry points for long-term investors. Historical Insights: Trends in the Index Historically, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has demonstrated patterns that align with major price movements. Extreme Greed Levels : Often precede sharp corrections, as excessive optimism leads to overbought conditions. Extreme Fear Levels : Typically align with market bottoms, presenting buying opportunities for contrarian investors. By analyzing past behavior, traders can use the index as a complementary tool alongside technical and fundamental analysis. What’s Next for the Crypto Market? As the index settles into the “Greed” zone, several scenarios could unfold: Sustained Optimism : The market may maintain its bullish trajectory, with prices gradually rising. Cooling Sentiment : If additional metrics weaken, the index could dip further, potentially signaling a short-term correction. Renewed Rally : A sudden surge in trading volume or positive market news could push the index back into the “Extreme Greed” zone. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s drop to 74 on December 27 highlights a subtle shift in market sentiment, moving from “Extreme Greed” to the “Greed” zone. This change reflects a balancing act between bullish momentum and cautious optimism, offering traders and investors valuable insights into the market’s current emotional state. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, staying informed about tools like the Fear & Greed Index can empower participants to navigate volatility and capitalize on emerging opportunities.

PEPE & WIF Sellers Increase While DTX Exchange (DTX) Becomes Ultimate Winner,"Due to the increasing bearish wave, it hasn’t been a great month for all meme coins in the market. Despite Bitcoin’s swift ascent beyond $100k, experts warn that these quirky coins could face a massive sell-off before the year ends. This situation is quite evident with Pepe Coin (PEPE) and DogWifHat (WIF), as they witness more selling pressure. It has spurred many to conclude what could help circumvent their losses and turn their fortunes around. Amidst the ongoing market dip, DTX Exchange has become the ultimate winner with its captivating presale event and approach to the trading world. So far, this viral project has raised over $10.5 million within two months. Let’s find out more about these cryptos in this post. Meme Coins Face Huge Sell-Off: What it Means for Pepe Coin (PEPE) and DogWifHat (WIF) There’s no doubt that meme coins impressed in the 2024 market year, with investors and traders speculating if they could trigger the bull run. Those speculations may be over as the meme coin sector faces huge drawdowns in its overall market cap. Experts have warned that these assets, especially WIF and PEPE, could see more price drops. Starting with Pepe Coin, a careful look at its charts reveals that its upward movement from May 2023 may have ended. Since its December peak price of 0.00002739, PEPE has dipped by over 50% in value, currently sitting at $0.00001747. On the technical side, things aren’t looking great for this once-promising asset, and we might see more bearish moves before the year ends. DogWifHat faces a similar trajectory despite its promising start to the 2024 crypto market. The coin’s weekly chart points to a more bearish phase as the price continues to retrace after its peak price of $4.86 in March. While it recovered briefly to the upside, thanks to Trump’s victory and Bitcoin’s 100k march, WIF now trades at $1.86, a -40% from the past month. As sellers increase on these meme coins, traders could focus on DTX Exchange to help recover their losses before the new year. DTX Exchange Emerges as the Ultimate Winner in the Crypto Market Despite PEPE and WIF’s continued drawdowns, the focus is shifting to DTX Exchange , which could dominate the crypto scene and is perhaps the most talked about in DeFi. This project is designed to be a hybrid platform powered by its innovative layer-1 blockchain technology, VulcanX. DTX isn’t just about hype; it’s about delivering real value. Its hybrid model, combining the strengths of centralized and decentralized systems, has resonated with a global audience. As a result, the altcoin gains value with every passing day. At the center of this ecosystem lies the DTX Token, which holds certain perks for holders and traders. Token holders enjoy reduced trading fees, access to premium features, and loyalty rewards. On top of that, the decentralized governance system gives users voting rights over platform upgrades. This would put power directly into the hands of the community. While meme coins face uncertainties that have shaken investor confidence, DTX Exchange thrives and aims to become a clear alternative. Its interoperability is a game-changer, enabling seamless trading across multiple blockchains. This opens the door to a vast range of assets and liquidity that enhances the user experience. Notably, retail traders and investors are flooding DTX’s presale, eager to claim their stake in what could be a historic crypto rally. This hybrid platform has captivated traders and investors with its presale performance, smashing records in Stage 6. DTX tokens are available at $0.12, and their demand continues to soar. Early backers have already enjoyed significant returns of over 500%, and there are no signs of slowing. As the presale progresses toward its listing price, analysts forecast an explosive rally once the token hits major exchanges. DTX Exchange Could Be the Altcoin That Could Deliver Steady Gains in 2025 The meme coin market may continue to see more selling pressures into the new year. As WIF and PEPE feel the impact of the bearish wave, DTX Exchange is eager to become the ultimate winner. DTX Exchange has all the hallmarks of a market leader: cutting-edge technology, unmatched versatility, and a fair presale gaining traction. It’s no surprise that investors are eyeing it as the better alternative to meme coins. With exchange listings on the horizon, it would be best to take advantage of DTX Exchange’s early stages before it soars.

This is due to SHIB maintaining its stable price of $0.000022 and 1Fuel’s ongoing presale raking in more than $800k so far. With 1Fuel up for grabs as low as $0.012 per token, analysts are projecting massive returns up to 1000%. Both coins present unique opportunities, so traders are weighing their options. Is SHIB’s stability sustainable, or could 1Fuel’s rise disrupt the status quo? Read on to find out. SHIB’s price action: stability or volatility? When Shiba Inu first came, it quickly gained speed and value as it drew in a community of investors with its cute charm. That, paired with headlines and tweets from personalities like Elon Musk and Vitalik Buterin, made SHIB a high demand token. Shiba Inu has held steady at $0.000022 after periods of volatility. This has reassured its holders that all is well. Or is it? SHIB is backed by a strong community, and now by utilities recently introduced into the ecosystem. Despite these, analysts are indicating that Shina Inu’s calm period is temporary. At the end of the day, SHIB is still a meme coin that faces sharp price swings due to speculation. Recent whale activity around the token suggests that volatility could return soon. No doubt that SHIB’s price floor offers investors a sense of security. However, many are wondering if it’s one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy before a potential breakout—or breakdown. 1Fuel’s momentum: The rising challenger As Shiba Inu focuses on maintaining its price level, 1Fuel is charging ahead with an explosive presale phase. Simply put, 1Fuel is set to be the next breakout cryptocurrency, with experts predicting massive growth potential. During the presale alone, early investors could see returns of 500% or more! 1Fuel is a utility-driven altcoin that simplifies multi-chain transactions and offers low-cost transfers. This appeals to investors looking for functionality beyond meme-based tokens. 1Fuel’s presale phase alone has already set it apart from several established altcoins during their early stages. The token brings a cross-chain capability and focuses on decentralized finance. 1Fuel stands out as a practical and scalable option. 1Fuel’s daily increasing presale suggests confidence in its long-term potential, solidifying its status as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in before the year runs out. Comparing Investment Potential: SHIB vs. 1Fuel When evaluating which coin is the best cryptocurrency to buy , both SHIB and 1Fuel cater to different investor profiles. Shiba Inu leans towards investors seeking speculative gains influenced by the community and social media. The token has shown rapid growth in the past, but concerns about its long-term utility remain. 1Fuel, on the other hand, targets investors focused on utility tokens with tangible use cases in the blockchain ecosystem. 1Fuel’s ability to streamline multi-chain transactions gives it an edge for long-term sustainability. If you’re looking for tokens that can move rapidly based on hype, SHIB is your go-to token. However, for investors who prioritize innovation and practicality, 1Fuel offers a compelling narrative as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in for massive long-term gains. Conclusion As it is right now, SHIB is clinging to its $0.000022 support level. At the same time, 1Fuel is experiencing a meteoric presale that’s capturing investor interest. Its community-backed stability vs real-world use cases. If you’re looking to decide between the best cryptocurrency to buy , join the 1Fuel presale today.

38186743,https://invezz.com/?p=2407881,1735308000,"This Solana (SOL) competitor could make you super rich in 2025, and it’s not Cardano (ADA) or Sui (SUI)","Solana (SOL) has generated a lot of buzz due to its efficiency alongside effective development for quite some time now. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) and Sui (SUI) also have solid records of achievements. However, a new player in the market, Rexas Finance (RXS), is making its mark as a disruptor in the blockchain industry. Given its novel approach to real asset tokenization and increased market acceptance of its proposition, Rexas Finance will surpass these tokens and generate huge profits in 2025. What makes Rexas Finance (RXS) unique? Rexas Finance’s fundamental component is the implementation of artificial intelligence to generate new NFTs. This will eradicate the artificial boundaries created between technology and creativity. Together with the integration of AI, Rexas Finance aims to revolutionize the real estate market by tokenizing properties, allowing investors worldwide to invest from virtually anywhere. With that aside, the unique key aspect of the platform itself includes granting the users unlimited usage of the features to create and deploy custom tokens. This concept allows investments to be carried out in a whole new dimension. It would undoubtedly allow millions of global investors to access previously illiquid markets. Instead of trying to compete with platforms like Solana, Cardano, and Sui that center their core on decentralization, Rexas Finance looks to fill the gap in the real estate market of illiquid assets by focusing primarily on the tokenization of art, property, and commodities. This ecosystem can affect the industry as it fully embraces the harnessed potential of blending real-world assets with blockchain technologies. In more simplified terms, Rexas Finance aims to rapidly shift how people perceive blockchain by showcasing practical usage of the services and bridging the market gap. Rexas Finance presale success: a glimpse into the future Due to its well-organized presale campaign, Rexas Finance has shown considerable promise. Since it was made available in September 2024, the RXS token has increased by 400%. During stage one of the campaign, the token began at $0.03, and by stage ten, it stood at $0.15. Most investors were highly inclined, considering that the presale raised over $31.5 million, and 369 million tokens out of the 380 million were sold. RXS token will be released on various exchanges with a price tag of $0.20; there are speculations that it could rise to as much as $10 by late 2025. Rexas Finance’s business model, which addresses the liquidity of assets and how easily they can be obtained, bolsters these expectations. The company’s expansion comes from an active and committed community, creative features, targeted promotion campaigns, and cooperation with traditional and blockchain companies. Rexas Finance is looking for investors to help it grow rapidly and penetrate the market. In the scope of blockchain, spaciousness has a clearly defined target, allowing it to implement innovative ideas while achieving tangible market results. This will help them integrate assets into the digital currency. Security and strategic giveaways: the backbone of RXS’s success Rexas Finance’s attention to security is one of its strongest selling points, especially for investors looking for a suitable blockchain platform. The project’s CertiK-audited smart contracts offer the most potent guarantees of the token’s safety and preservation, making it a viable choice for institutional and retail traders. Since RXS emphasizes security measures, this safeguards users and enhances its standing as a reputable and competitive force in the aggressive blockchain environment. In addition to its excitement, Rexas Finance has initiated a $1 million giveaway as part of its marketing strategy, adding to its attraction. This campaign is aimed at enhancing community participation and is thus offering 50,000 RXS tokens to 20 participants. In addition to the immediate financial advantages that such a program brings to its participants, the giveaway has been instrumental in creating a dedicated and active following around the project. Thus, this mix of enhanced security features coupled with creative marketing approaches enables Rexas Finance to instill confidence and encourage uptake from worldwide investors. Conclusion: RXS is the token to watch in 2025 Although Solana, Cardano, and Sui have advantages, Rexas Finance (RXS) is at a different level. RXS has the potential to usher in a decisive bull run solely because of its vision for the blockchain space. Investors looking for a project with potential and use cases and a community should consider Rexas Finance. By 2025, RXS will have made incredible returns, showing clear indicators that it could be a major player in the cryptocurrency market.

38184942,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376433,1735307754,Ethereum Price Analysis: ETH Could Plummet to $3K After Losing These Support Levels,"Ethereum’s price has failed to break above the key $4,000 level and has been experiencing bearish price action since then. Investors are now worried that ETH might be reversing its overall price trajectory. Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The Daily Chart The daily chart shows that Ethereum’s price has formed a clear double-top pattern at the $4,000 resistance level while getting rejected twice. The $3,500 level has also been broken to the downside, and the market has failed to reclaim it following multiple unsuccessful attempts. At the current stage, a drop lower toward the $3,000 support zone and the 200-day moving average, located around the same level, looks probable. Price’s reaction to this key level could determine the mid-term fate of the market. The 4-Hour Chart Looking at the 4-hour timeframe, a drop toward the $3,000 level seems less probable, as the market is seemingly climbing toward the $3,500 level to test it again. With the RSI also on the verge of rising above the %50 threshold, the market is demonstrating bullish momentum in this timeframe. This can indicate that a breakout above the $3,500 level is more probable this time. This scenario is of course, valid if the price is able to reach the level soon. On-Chain Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Ethereum Exchange Reserve While Ethereum’s price has been dropping after getting rejected by the $4,000 resistance level, looking at on-chain network activity provides an interesting clue to investors’ behaviour. This chart presents the Ethereum exchange reserve metric, which measures the amount of ETH that is held in trading platforms. This value is also used as a proxy for supply, as the coins held in exchanges can be sold almost any time. As the chart presents, the exchange reserve metric has been gradually rising over the past few months, indicating that the investors are selling their coins, likely for a profit, as the price reaches the $4,000 level. This has been one of the key contributing factors to the current halt in Ethereum’s bullish run. Meanwhile, during the recent price correction, the exchange reserve metric has been dropping and is currently declining below its 100-day moving average. This can indicate a potential accumulation by market participants, that could soon lead to a rally higher for ETH.

A fake Squid Game token was just launched on Base three hours ago, with the creator holding the most tokens. The price of the token has plummeted by 99%, which is a sign of a rugpull. This happens when creators sell their tokens once the price peaks. In this case, the price dropped from $0.1442 to $0.0000000000001269. #PeckShieldAlert Beware of scam #SquidGame tokens circulating in the wild. We have detected a fraudulent #SquidGame token deployed on #Base just 3 hours ago, with the deployer as the largest holder. The token has dropped 99%. pic.twitter.com/EIdaUldzaF — PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) December 27, 2024 Cryptocurrencies, especially those associated with popular trends or big names, can attract attention, even when they have no real value. In this case, the Squid Game Token was heavily hyped, despite glaring red flags that suggested it was too good to be true. It’s a sad fact that many people fall for these types of scams because they don’t take the time to research the project. This incident is a prime example of the dangers of FOMO (fear of missing out) and the role it plays in driving people to make hasty decisions with their money. What Happened in 2021? Squid Game Token was valued at $2,800 per coin in 2021 when a similar scam happened. But once the developers pulled the rug, the token’s value crashed, leaving investors with coins worth almost nothing. This dramatic drop was a stark reminder of how high-risk and unpredictable the world of cryptocurrency can be, especially when scams are involved. The Squid Game Token scam is a wake-up call for anyone considering investing in cryptocurrency. It’s crucial to do your own research and not just follow the crowd. While the allure of quick gains is strong, it’s important to remember that scams like this are far too common.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | TRADING | RESEARCH,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-scam-alert-squid-game-inspired-token-drops-99-in-shocking-scam/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

38186124,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323050,1735307340,Trump-Linked Bitcoin Bond ETF Proposal Shakes the Market – How Quickly Can BTC Reach $1 Million?,"Strive, an asset manager founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, has filed for U.S. regulatory approval to list an exchange-traded fund (ETF) focusing on convertible bonds issued by corporate Bitcoin buyers like MicroStrategy. According to Strive’s Dec. 26 filing , the ETF would provide exposure to “Bitcoin Bonds,” defined as convertible securities whose proceeds are used to purchase Bitcoin. This actively managed fund may also use financial derivatives like swaps and options to gain exposure. While management fees for the fund remain undisclosed, actively managed ETFs typically charge higher fees than passive alternatives. If approved, the ETF could open new avenues for institutional investors to indirectly gain Bitcoin exposure, solidifying its mainstream appeal. Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET The Rise of Bitcoin Bonds MicroStrategy’s pioneering approach of financing Bitcoin acquisitions through convertible bonds and stock has yielded extraordinary returns. Since 2020, the company has spent around $27 billion accumulating Bitcoin. Its stock, MSTR, has surged over 2,200% since then, eclipsing nearly every major public company except Nvidia. Corporate treasuries collectively hold approximately $56 billion worth of Bitcoin, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET, with firms like Tesla and Square also adopting similar strategies. This trend underscores the growing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Strive files for “Bitcoin Bond” ETF… Would seek exposure to convertible securities issued by MicroStrategy. pic.twitter.com/ybJjbVFWUN — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 26, 2024 Trump Administration Sparks ETF Optimism Strive’s connection to President-elect Donald Trump adds a political dimension to the ETF filing. Founded by Ramaswamy, a Trump ally, Strive aims to reshape investment practices to align with pro-capitalist values. Trump’s crypto-friendly stance, including proposed leadership changes at key regulatory bodies, has fueled optimism for pending ETF approvals. The president-elect’s appointment of figures like former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins signals potential shifts in regulatory frameworks favoring crypto innovation. Industry analysts believe Trump’s leadership could expedite approval for Bitcoin and altcoin ETFs, marking a pivotal moment for the market. Bitcoin Price Analysis Bitcoin’s price currently stands at $96,420, recovering 1.12% in the last 24 hours, with a trading volume of $47.16 billion. However, a descending trendline at $98,300, reinforced by the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, limits upward momentum. On the downside, Bitcoin faces immediate support at $94,734, with critical zones at $92,105 and $89,418. The RSI at 47.78 reflects neutral sentiment, while the 50-day EMA at $97,460 aligns with the pivot point, highlighting its importance for short-term traders. A decisive break above $98,300 could set the stage for a retest of $100,252, but failure to breach resistance might intensify bearish pressure. Can BTC Hit $1 Million? The $1 million Bitcoin target has long been a speculative milestone for enthusiasts and investors. The launch of ETFs like Strive’s Bitcoin Bond ETF could accelerate adoption by offering institutional-grade exposure. Analysts suggest that if Bitcoin adoption parallels gold as a store of value—currently at a $13 trillion market cap—Bitcoin’s price could exceed $600,000. Paired with diminishing supply and increasing corporate treasury use, the path to $1 million hinges on macroeconomic tailwinds and regulatory clarity. Key Takeaways Strive’s Bitcoin Bond ETF filing underscores the growing institutional appetite for Bitcoin-linked assets. Trump’s pro-crypto administration could accelerate ETF approvals, benefiting Bitcoin and altcoin markets. Bitcoin’s short-term outlook depends on breaking the $98,300 resistance, with $100,252 being the next critical level.

Virtuals Protocol ( VIRTUAL ) soared from the year-to-date low of $0.02234 in August to $3.4 on Dec. 27. This rally happened because of the rising hype surrounding artificial intelligence agents. AI agents are software tools that use AI to perform tasks for the end user. Virtuals Protocol hopes to become the crypto industry’s biggest decentralized AI agent network by allowing users to create these agents. Some of its top agents have achieved a multi-million market cap. For example, G.A.M.E has a market cap of over $304 million, while Prefrontal Cortex Convo Agent and Luna are valued at over $100 million. Virtuals Protocol’s price action has mirrored that of other big players in the AI space like NVIDIA, Palantir, and Broadcom. All these firms have become giants by focusing on AI solutions. NVIDIA and Broadcom are in the semiconductor industry, while Palantir is building AI software solutions.

Most of Virtuals’ trading volume happens in exchanges like Bybit, Bitget, and Gate. A listing by other top tier-1 exchanges would push it higher. However, numerous risks remain. The AI industry and its accompanying hype may slow down in 2025, affecting most assets. Moreover, there are fears that most AI assets have become highly overvalued. VIRTUAL price faces technical risks VIRTUAL price chart | source: crypto.news The VIRTUAL token faces mean reversion and Wyckoff Method risks. As shown above, Virtual price has moved 90% above the 50-day moving average. Therefore, the concept of mean reversion states that an asset often retreats back to the historical average. As such, if this happens, VIRTUAL will likely drop sharply to meet the 50-day moving average. Meanwhile, the Wyckoff Method states that assets go through numerous stages. In this case, Virtuals Protocol remained in an accumulation phase between May and November, which usually has minimal price movements. It then entered the mark-up phase that is now going on. The coin will now move to the distribution phase followed by the markdown. If this happens, the coin may drop to $2 soon.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said he'd accepted an invitation to be the “adoptive father” of pygmy hippo Moo Deng when she grows up. He is also donating 10 million Thai baht ($300,000) to the Khao Kheow Open Zoo near Bangkok where the five-month-old lives, he said in a Thursday posting on X.  The donations, made in Moo Deng’s name, will be used to upgrade general zoo operations and create a dedicated pygmy hippo habitat within the premises.  Buterin said the donations came on the back of the “wonderful hospitality of Thailand” during November’s annual Ethereum developer conference, and were a “gesture of friendship and respect” to all of the country.  “What better way to do that than through a Christmas present to someone who is dear to all Thai people, Moo Deng, and who has become one of the most unexpected and important Thai celebrities on the world stage,"" Buterin said in a letter to the zoo.  Moo Deng, or bouncy pork in Thai, became a popular internet meme earlier this year after images of her went viral online. She has two siblings, brother Moo Toon (stewed pork) and sister Moo Waan (sweet pork).  A memecoin she inspired, MOODENG on Solana, went similarly viral and hit a market capitalization of above $600 million in November after bagging listings on influential exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase.   MOODENG was the first token themed on an animal other than a dog or cat to garner massive trading volumes and is considered by some to be the first Thai memecoin.

According to the Phnom Penh Post , the NBC formally declared the decision to allow banks to provide services involving Category 1 crypto assets on Dec. 27. Category 1 crypto asset are cryptocurrencies backed by fiat, including stablecoins such as USD Coin ( USDC ), USDT ( USDT ) as well as central bank digital currencies. Though, this also means that Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ) and other standalone cryptocurrencies are still prohibited in Cambodia. Under this new law, all commercial banks and payment firms must first receive approval from the central bank if they want to provide crypto-related service. Once they are authorized, banks and payment institutions can convert crypto into fiat currencies and vice versa. They will also be allowed to facilitate cryptocurrency transfers between accounts and provide custody services. However, financial institutions are strictly prohibited from using client’s crypto assets for their own benefit. You might also like: Cambodia bans 16 major exchanges including Binance, OKX and Coinbase Before the NBC declaration, Cambodia had banned its citizens from making crypto transactions or trading cryptocurrencies due to the high volatility posed by virtual assets, as well as the widely held perception that crypto facilitates illicit activities such as money laundering and fraud.

Though compared to those countries, Cambodia is still in its very early stages. Earlier this month, Cambodia blocked 16 major crypto exchanges including Binance, OKX, and Coinbase. The exchanges failed to secure licenses from Cambodia’s Securities and Exchange Regulator, which is necessary for operating in the country.

38184877,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633943,1735307154,Whale loses $500K on MIRA token as charity token trend gains ground,"A whale lost $500K on the MIRA token, which built up hype around being linked to rare disease research. The token was tied to Siqi Chen, co-founder of Serious Business and Runway, with no previous connections to crypto or memes. The MIRA token saw active trading after a big part of the supply was sent to Siqi Chen, co-founder of Serious Business and Runway. The initial hype around the token suggested the asset would be used to fund research into rare diseases. However, soon after the launch, MIRA went through extreme volatility. Recently, MIRA wiped as much as $500K from a whale trader, who poured more than $1.56M into the token. The buyer is still holding, though. Within hours, the value of the token holdings fell to $718,000, extending its downward trend. Despite the noble cause, once Chen sold his share and whales took profit, the token did not find support from anywhere else. The whale that lost on MIRA has been aping into meme tokens since November, targeting the hottest trending memes. The whale had scored significant gains in the same wallet, with $1.1M in PNUT tokens, and $962K worth of PENGU . MIRA helped fund research, but early buyers took profits MIRA appeared on Christmas day when it was airdropped to Siqi Chen. Later, Chen received a large part of the supply of Kitkat, a new token named after his dog. Chen only provided a crypto wallet after a community request, as an additional payment option to the GoFundMe page for his research cause. MIRA was generated on Solana by an anonymous creator with the message that it would help with scientific funding. The token was named after Mira, Chen’s young daughter, who suffers from a rare and life-threatening form of brain tumor. The token’s initial story was appealing enough to early buyers, but MIRA’s rally was short-lived, leading to large losses. MIRA crashed soon after its launch, as early whales took profits and did not donate to charity or research. | Source: DexScreener Chen himself sold his share of the token, promising to use the funds for further research. However, early traders that sniped the token right after the launch actually made profits, with no intention of supporting science or research. At the same time, other buyers lost a significant part of their net value, expecting buyers to hold MIRA for the long term. “ How much degens make or lose money in the pvp trenches of pump is not something that is any of my business. if you made a lot of money, i’m genuinely happy for you – but please consider donating some of your profits to hankinson lab., if you lost a lot of money, i’m very sorry – but magic internet money is magic internet money,” wrote Chen in a lengthy X post . Still in the first days since its launch, MIRA is yet to have a relief rally, raising questions about the ethics of funding through meme tokens. Before whales realized profits, Chen held up to $18M worth of MIRA tokens. Initially, the share was worth $400K, but MIRA appreciated as rapidly as other meme tokens. However, the asset lacked enough liquidity to absorb real whale selling, leading to deepening losses. Just days after the token’s launch, MIRA liquidity is down to $771K, practically leaving holders unable to sell without crashing the market. MIRA launch sparks a trend of research-funding tokens The hype around MIRA created a new type of meme tokens in the “launch to save” trend. While Chen’s cause had a real-life basis and real research potential, other meme tokens were just created to ride the hype, producing risky assets that would be rug-pulled immediately. Pump.fun saw an inflow of new tokens with the “charity” tag in the days around Christmas. It especially capitalized on people’s generosity. “Charity” has turned into a meta-narrative for new launches, where the token creators do not even bother to actually donate. The creators launch tokens , and then donate a portion to the wallets of legitimate organizations. However, the real goal is to make profitable trades, often leaving the real organizations with no value. Earlier this year, Vitalik Buterin wrote about the potential of meme tokens to raise funds for charity. Buterin himself often liquidates meme assets and sends the funds to support his favorite projects. However, the recent meta-narrative of charity tokens is much riskier, as it may benefit dishonest early holders.

His assessment comes during a period of significant market volatility, with Bitcoin’s recent descent from its peak above $108,000 causing ripples throughout the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Despite the broader market turbulence, XRP has maintained notable stability, recording a positive performance with a 15% gain in December. This resilience becomes particularly significant when compared to the performance of other major cryptocurrencies, with Ethereum and Bitcoin experiencing recent declines. XRP has maintained a steady position above the $2 mark since it reclaimed that level earlier this month. Where Is XRP Going Next? Drawing from his decade-long market involvement, Moe categorized potential price targets for XRP into three distinct probability tiers. His most conservative projection suggests a 4x increase from current levels, potentially elevating XRP’s price to approximately $8.64. This forecast aligns with earlier predictions from other market analysts, including a $9.6 target from EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto). We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Moving beyond the conservative outlook, Moe identifies a 9x increase as achievable, though with additional risk factors. This projection would place XRP’s value at almost $20. However, market conditions must be favorable for such an extensive price appreciation to happen. Regarding more ambitious predictions, Moe also predicted a potential 15x increase, which would drive XRP’s price to just under $33. EGRAG CRYPTO has also previously predicted a climb to $33 , which strengthens the case for this massive rally. However, Moe described this target as unlikely. Reaching these lofty targets would require perfect market conditions, and many analysts cannot agree on a singular path that can send XRP to this level. Despite this, there are many reasons to be bullish on XRP. The asset is showing major signs pointing to an impending rally , and major developments in the crypto space like the upcoming resignation of Gary Gensler, current Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), would significantly benefit the digital asset. At press time, XRP traded at $2.16, struggling to regain the $2.2 level. Its 6.3% drop from yesterday mirrors the broader market’s problems, and it won’t be long before the market is back in form and XRP’s upward journey continues.

38184499,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376418,1735306822,Shiba Inu Tops a Prestigious Ranking in India: Details,"TL;DR Shiba Inu (SHIB) became the most-traded cryptocurrency in India this year, with 9% of local traders engaging with it. SHIB’s price has declined in the past month, but advancements in Shibarium and a robust token-burning mechanism could contribute for another rally soon. SHIB Leads the Pack Despite the most recent correction, 2024 has been highly successful for meme coins, many of which experienced substantial price gains. One example is Shiba Inu (SHIB), the valuation of which has skyrocketed by 115% year-to-date (YTD). The impressive resurgence could be one reason why the self-proclaimed Dogecoin-killer has increased its popularity across the globe . Most recently, Kashif Raza (founder of the crypto education platform Bitinning ) revealed that SHIB had been the most-traded cryptocurrency in India this year. Approximately 9% of the local traders have dealt with it, while Pepe (PEPE) ranks second with 8%. Bitcoin (BTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Tether (USDT) follow up next. Raza further maintained that around 5% of the Indian HODLers have included SHIB in their portfolios. DOGE is the leader in this ranking with 8%. According to the research, Jalandhar is the Indian city with the most meme coin traders. In 2024, roughly 18% of the traders residing in the northern town interacted with the niche. The strongest month for SHIB this year was March when the price jumped to a two-year high. Back then, it became the most-traded digital asset on India’s leading crypto exchange, WazirX, surpassing BTC, PEPE, FLOKI, and DOGE. SHIB Price Outlook The price of the meme coin is currently trading far below its peak registered in March. As of this writing, SHIB is worth approximately $0.00002223, which represents a 10% monthly decline. SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko Still, some important elements suggest that the asset could experience another bull run soon. One example is the further advancement of the layer-2 scaling solution – Shibarium. The network, whose ultimate goal is to foster the development of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, recently hit another major milestone. As CryptoPotato reported , the total transactions processed on the protocol exceeded 700 million. Shiba Inu’s burning mechanism should also be mentioned . The successful execution of the program will reduce the tremendous supply of SHIB, potentially making it more valuable (assuming demand doesn’t head south). In the past 24 hours, the burn rate has increased by almost 50%, resulting in 27.4 million tokens destroyed. Since adopting the mechanism, the team and community have burned over 410.7 trillion SHIB, leaving 584.1 trillion in circulation.

38184470,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=114896,1735306744,Prediction Market Traders Signal New Highs for Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2025,"Prediction Market Traders Signal New Highs for Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2025 The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with optimism as prediction markets indicate significant potential for Bitcoin and Ethereum to hit all-time highs in 2025. Platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi reveal that traders are betting heavily on both assets reaching unprecedented price levels, reflecting growing confidence in the long-term value of these leading cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum: Price Predictions for 2025 According to a report from Cointelegraph , traders on Kalshi predict a greater than 60% chance that Bitcoin will reach at least $125,000 , while Ethereum is expected to surpass $5,000 by the end of 2025. Similarly, Polymarket users assign a 50% probability to Bitcoin reaching $120,000 as early as March 2025. These predictions highlight bullish sentiment across the crypto community, driven by several factors, including increasing institutional interest, adoption of blockchain technology, and macroeconomic trends that favor digital assets. What Are Prediction Markets? Prediction markets are platforms where users can trade contracts based on the outcomes of future events, offering insights into collective expectations. In the context of cryptocurrency, these markets aggregate trader sentiment and serve as a barometer for price speculation. How Prediction Markets Work Users place bets on specific outcomes, such as price targets for Bitcoin or Ethereum. Market prices reflect the collective probability of these outcomes. Platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi use blockchain technology to ensure transparency and security in trading. Prediction markets are often seen as more reliable indicators of sentiment compared to polls, as participants have financial stakes in their predictions. Key Drivers Behind the Optimism The bullish predictions for Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2025 are underpinned by several macroeconomic and industry-specific factors: 1. Institutional Adoption Major financial institutions are increasingly integrating Bitcoin and Ethereum into their portfolios and offering crypto-related services to clients. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, expected to launch in 2025, could drive significant inflows into the market. 2. Supply Dynamics Bitcoin Halving Event : Scheduled for April 2024, this event will reduce Bitcoin’s mining rewards, decreasing the supply of new coins and potentially boosting prices. Ethereum Staking : The continued growth of Ethereum staking reduces circulating supply, creating upward pressure on prices. 3. Broader Market Trends Macroeconomic Conditions : Persistent inflation and economic uncertainty have driven investors toward alternative assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Regulatory Clarity : Improved regulations in key markets, including the U.S., have enhanced investor confidence. Bitcoin: On Track for $125,000? Bitcoin’s price predictions for 2025 reflect a confluence of factors driving optimism: Halving Impact : Historically, Bitcoin’s halving events have preceded significant price rallies. With the next halving approaching, many traders expect a supply shock to propel prices. Institutional Demand : Companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have set precedents by holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets, a trend likely to continue as the asset gains legitimacy. Broader Adoption : Countries like El Salvador and increasing retail participation further solidify Bitcoin’s position as a global asset. While a price target of $125,000 might seem ambitious, previous bull runs have shown Bitcoin’s capacity for exponential growth in a short time. Ethereum: Reaching $5,000 and Beyond Ethereum’s role as the leading smart contract platform makes it a cornerstone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain innovation. Factors driving its price predictions include: Layer 2 Scaling : The adoption of Layer 2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum enhances Ethereum’s scalability and utility, attracting more developers and users. DeFi and NFTs : As the backbone of these sectors, Ethereum continues to dominate in transaction volume and value locked. Staking Growth : The increasing number of ETH staked in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network reduces its circulating supply, creating a deflationary effect. Given these dynamics, a $5,000 target for Ethereum in 2025 aligns with its ongoing evolution and adoption. Potential Risks to Consider While the sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, several risks could impact the trajectory of Bitcoin and Ethereum: Regulatory Uncertainty Stricter regulations or unfavorable policies could dampen market enthusiasm. Market Volatility Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile, with sharp corrections often following bullish phases. Global Competition Emerging competitors, such as Solana or Avalanche, could challenge Ethereum’s dominance, impacting its price growth. Conclusion Prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi offer a snapshot of the crypto community’s expectations for 2025, with traders betting heavily on Bitcoin and Ethereum reaching new highs. Backed by strong fundamentals, increasing institutional interest, and pivotal market events like Bitcoin’s halving, these predictions reflect an optimistic outlook for the leading cryptocurrencies. However, as with any investment, risks remain, and traders should approach predictions with caution. The coming year will undoubtedly be pivotal for the crypto industry, with the potential for both unprecedented growth and unexpected challenges.

38184441,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376447,1735306705,"Massive Bitcoin Chop, Trump’s Positive Crypto Comments, and More: This Week’s Recap","Merry Christmas, everybody! Even if Christmas is not your thing, we would like to take this opportunity to wish every and each one of you good will and fortune in the upcoming year and beyond! Speaking of holidays, Bitcoin tried to gift us with a new rally, but unfortunately the Grinch (in the face of sellers) stepped in and ruined the whole thing. The last seven days turned out to be very choppy in terms of price action. BTC pushed to $99K last weekend but the bears were quick to intervene, initiating a violent move that spanned for a few days, resulting in a drop toward $92,000. But on Christmas Eve, the bulls stepped up and pushed the price back up to $99,000, sparking hopes of a renewed end-of-year rally, which, unfortunately, was for not. The price quickly retraced and is currently trading at around $96,000 – more or less where it was this time last week. This highlights the importance of staying away from excessive leverage because these moves can quickly chop up your portfolio and produce unnecessary losses. That aside, there were some interesting developments. The President-elect of the United States, Donald Trump, reiterated that his administration has big plans for the industry, saying that they will “do something great with crypto.” He argued that the US should not fall behind other countries (naming China, which is surprising to absolutely nobody) when it comes to progress in that field. So, that’s good. In other news, MicroStrategy announced another whopping Bitcoin buy. The company bought more than 5,000 BTC earlier on Monday, solidifying its position as the world’s largest corporate holder by a massive margin. It’s interesting to note that other companies are starting to follow Michael Saylor’s strategy. KULR Technology Group – a publicly-listed firm trading on the New York Stock Exchange – announced a $21 million BTC buy as well as plans of prolonged purchasing strategy as part of their broader policy. Anyways, this is our last weekly market roundup for the year of 2024 and we will see you again next year! It’s incredibly exciting to see how 2025 will turn out – let’s hope that it’s every bit as good!

Dabbling into cryptocurrency price predictions must be one of the more interesting things to do at the end of the year. In this article, we’ve taken a closer look at those that were a hit and those that were a miss. Trump Gets It: Bitcoin Is a Bounty on Abundance Electricity Production. President-elect Donald Trump confirmed that his administration is “going to do something great with crypto.” His motives stem from the fact that he doesn’t want China “or anybody else” to be ahead. MicroStrategy’s Monday Streak Continues With 5,262 BTC Purchase. At this point, it probably doesn’t come much as a surprise to many, but yeah – MicroStrategy, the company spearheaded by one of Bitcoin’s most vocal proponents, Michael Saylor, bought another 5262 BTC this Monday. Binance Bitcoin Reserves Hit Lowest Level in 2024, Possible Indicator of Bullish Reversal. Despite the most recent slump in Bitcoin’s price, data suggests that there could be room for more upward movement. This is because the BTC reserves on Binance hit their lowest level in 2024 earlier this week, indicating the possibility of a reduced selling pressure and even a supply shock in the near future.

In a recent interview with Scott Melker, Alfred made a bold prediction for Bitcoin. Alfred claimed that Bitcoin will reach $180,000 by March 21, 2025. According to Alfred, the first quarter of 2025 will be very critical for Bitcoin and BTC will make huge gains. “The next two to three months are key to this four-year cycle.” The famous name based his bullish prediction on Bitcoin on the impact of the halving and increasing institutional acceptance through ETFs. Polymerket and Kalshi users are also expecting Bitcoin to reach a new ATH. At this point, Polymarket prices the probability of BTC reaching $120,000 before the end of March at 50%, while Kalshi prices the probability of Bitcoin reaching at least $125,000 in 2025 at more than 60%. *This is not investment advice.

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address – 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONPRIN.

The Central Bank of Cambodia now allows commercial banks and payment institutions to provide services involving Category 1 cryptocurrencies, i.e., backed or stable cryptocurrencies. However, unbacked cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, remain prohibited. The development was formalized in a prakas issued on December 26 and announced by NBC on December 27 as reported by The Phnom Penh post. The directive aims to regulate operations and businesses involving digital currencies, reflecting the country’s effort to keep pace with global financial innovations. Under the new directive from the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC), commercial banks and payment institutions must obtain prior approval to offer crypto-related services. Authorized institutions can engage in activities such as exchanging crypto assets for fiat currencies, transferring crypto between accounts, and providing custody services. However, they are explicitly prohibited from using their customers’ crypto assets for their own purposes. Historically, Cambodia has banned cryptocurrency transactions and trading due to concerns about high risks, including money laundering, fraud, and illicit activities in the black market. Economic researcher Hong Vanak of the Royal Academy of Cambodia noted the growing global popularity of cryptocurrencies, which are used not only for payments but also traded like stocks due to their highly volatile prices, particularly unbacked cryptocurrencies.

In a move targeting crypto users, Banco Central do Brasil (BCB) has officially proposed a ban on self-custodial stablecoins, sparking backlash from the community. The initiative, expected to be shaped into regulations next year, aims to prevent individuals from holding cryptocurrencies like USDT or USDC in independent, user-controlled wallets such as Metamask, Phantom, or Trezor. BCB: stablecoins facilitate tax evasion and illicit activities The proposal has been under consideration since at least October, when Roberto Campos Neto, the president of Brazil’s central bank, publicly stated that stablecoins and asset tokenization should be regulated in the country next year. However, it is likely that the plan has been in development for a much longer period. As early as 2023, Neto argued that stablecoins contribute to tax evasion and facilitate illicit activities. According to 2023 data from the BCB, annual cryptocurrency imports totaled $7.4 billion, having soared by 44.2% from January to August compared to the same period last year. Brazilians use stablecoins to hedge against inflation Notably, in recent times the local demand has shifted to stablecoins, which are linked to the US dollar or other real-world assets. This tendency suggests that Brazilian citizens are more likely to use cryptocurrencies as a means of payment rather than merely for investment. It’s hardly a wonder. Brazil has been experiencing increased inflation for several years, which has put downward pressure on the real, further exacerbated by political instability. The BCB has had to raise interest rates multiple times to contain price growth. Turning to stablecoins to protect their assets from devaluation has been only natural for Brazilian citizens. Cross-border crypto transactions available only for VASPs At this moment, it is not clear how the BCB plans to put its concepts into practice. The proposal has it that only authorized virtual asset service providers (VASPs) will be able to conduct cross-border crypto transactions. The transfer of stablecoins pegged to foreign national currencies to self-custodial wallets would be completely banned, and the use of such assets for domestic payments would be severely restricted. Additionally, BCB considers a ban on all cryptocurrency transfers (even beyond stablecoins) to foreign user-controlled crypto wallets. Brazilian VASPs would be required to perform foreign asset transfers only to regulated institutions. Brazil’s stablecoin restrictions likely to boost DeFi platforms However, what appears as a preventive measure to tackle looming dollarization of the Brazilian economy may in fact contribute to further decentralization. Brazilian authorities can force regulated platforms to implement controls on asset transfers but they have virtually no means to control the DeFi market and peer-to-peer transactions. Nevertheless, such a measure is likely to limit the amount of stablecoins changing hands in the local market due to more stringent KYC procedures. Brazil’s government is currently holding a public consultation set to conclude in February 2025. If new regulations are passed, decentralized platforms such as Uniswap or SushiSwap are likely to be among the winners. This occurred when China introduced a ban on centralized crypto exchanges and when Nigeria implemented anti-crypto policies preventing banks from facilitating crypto transactions.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | WALLET,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6732/brazil-to-ban-individual-stablecoin-transactions-in-a-move-to-ramp-up-kyc,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Despite Coinbase’s decision in mid-December to delist USDt , the stablecoin continues to trade across European exchanges, leaving many investors and traders questioning its future within the EU. MiCA Regulatory Clarity Still Missing for USDt The absence of clear guidance from EU regulators has left the stablecoin in a state of limbo. While no official statement has been made declaring USDt non-compliant with MiCA , its status remains unclear. Juan Ignacio Ibañez, a member of the MiCA Crypto Alliance, said in a recent interview that just because regulators have not explicitly stated USDt’s non-compliance does not necessarily mean it complies either. He suggested that exchanges may be adopting a “wait-and-see” approach, anticipating further clarity from European authorities. For now, many European exchanges, such as Binance and Crypto.com, continue to offer USDt trading. Ibañez speculated that Coinbase’s delisting decision could be driven by a desire to avoid regulatory risks ahead of the MiCA deadline, but he noted that not all exchanges are taking the same route. The real question remains whether European regulators will issue a directive by December 30, causing mass delistings, or whether exchanges will gradually pull USDt from their platforms based on evolving regulatory stances. Regulatory Silence Sparks Speculation The uncertainty around USDt’s future in Europe stems from conflicting reports. Some outlets, including Bloomberg, have suggested that European exchanges will be required to delist USDt after December 30, 2024. However, European regulators, including the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), have refrained from confirming whether USDt falls under MiCA’s restrictions. Despite this, reports indicate that Tether’s USDt could face an eventual ban across Europe, though no official confirmation has been made. In a statement in October 2024, ESMA clarified that it was still working with market participants to address issues related to stablecoins, without providing concrete answers regarding USDt. As the MiCA regulations prepare to go live, all eyes will be on European regulators for guidance on how they will handle Tether’s status. In the absence of definitive regulatory action, the future of USDt in the European market remains shrouded in uncertainty.

38184213,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667546,1735306221,Solana Dips Below $194 – A Continued Consolidation In Sight?,"Solana price action is at a critical juncture, with the cryptocurrency testing market’s patience, it hovers just below the pivotal $194 resistance level. This threshold has emerged as a significant hurdle as bulls struggle to sustain enough momentum to power a breakout despite recent attempts to push higher. The current phase of consolidation raises important questions about Solana’s next move. A successful breakout above this level could signal the start of a fresh rally, propelling the price toward new highs. However, failure to breach $194 might result in prolonged sideways trading or a potential pullback. Technical Indicators Signal Mixed Momentum Solana trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) raises concerns about the possibility of further downside movement. The 100-day SMA is a significant technical indicator often used to assess an asset’s overall trend. When the price consistently trades below this level, it typically suggests that the market sentiment is leaning toward the bearish side, with selling pressure outweighing buying activity. This situation may signal that SOL is vulnerable to additional losses, especially if the bears continue to dominate the market. A sustained stay below the 100-day SMA might lead to a deeper pullback, potentially testing lower support levels. However, for the bulls to regain control, Solana would need to break above the 100-day SMA and turn it into a support level. Until then, the price could struggle to mount a significant recovery as bearish forces remain in play. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Gearing Up: Is a New Surge on the Horizon? Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests that Solana’s price may be poised for an upward move. After dipping to a low of 41%, the RSI line is now gradually rising, indicating a possible shift in momentum. A level below 30% typically signals oversold conditions, while levels above 70% suggest overbought conditions. As the RSI recovers and climbs above 41%, this resurgence reflects a growing buying interest. A continued upward movement in the RSI would support the case for an increase in Solana’s price, with the possibility of breaking through key resistance levels. Thus, the rising RSI could be a positive indicator for traders, suggesting that Solana may undergo a recovery in the near term. Market Sentiment: Solana Bulls And Bears In Tug-of-War Solana’s price action below the $194 resistance level reflects a classic battle between bullish optimism and bearish caution. Bulls are fueled by the asset’s recent recovery momentum and broader market support, aiming to push the price past the critical resistance zone. A successful breakout above $194 could act as a strong bullish confirmation, attracting buying interest and driving SOL to the next resistance level at $209. Related Reading: Solana Holds Weekly Support At $180 – Analyst Expects $330 Mid-Term Conversely, bears are equally resolute in defending the $194 level, considering it a key pivot point to halt the ongoing rally. If bears succeed in preventing the price from surpassing this resistance, Solana could begin to decline again, potentially heading toward the $164 support level and beyond.

To identify the best crypto presales, you must assess several key factors to ensure the project is both promising and trustworthy. First and foremost, research the project’s team—are they experienced and transparent about their background? A genuine team with a proven track record in the crypto space will be more likely to deliver on their promises. Moreover, look for whitepapers or technical documents that clearly outline the project’s vision, tokenomics, and use cases. Presales with robust planning are often the best crypto presales, as they indicate a well-thought-out long-term strategy. Another crucial step is examining the platform’s security measures, especially after 2024’s surge in hacks like the $1.34 billion theft by North Korean hackers. Security breaches can significantly undermine the value and trustworthiness of a project, so presales with strong encryption and private key protection should be prioritized. Additionally, take a look at the community around the presale; a growing, engaged community is a sign of legitimacy. Social media presence, influencer endorsements, and active discussions on platforms like Telegram and Discord can provide more insight into the project’s credibility. Lastly, always consider the project’s tokenomics: do they have fair distribution, with enough incentives for early investors but not so much that it leads to inflationary risks?

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Dogecoin eyes a 2025 rally while Rollblock’s GameFi solutions positions it to outpace DOGE, SOL, and XRP with real-world utility. Table of Contents Rollblock takes the lead with decentralized gaming platform Dogecoin records high network activity, Open Interest peaks Solana faces uncertain market sentiment despite flashing recovery signal XRP records mysterious whale activity amid market downturn Rollblock to overthrow DOGE, SOL and XRP Dogecoin is preparing for an explosive rally in 2025 while Solana and XRP face an uncertain market sentiment. Even if Dogecoin surpasses SOL and XRP soon, can it compete with Rollblock’s GameFi project? Let’s find out. Rollblock takes the lead with decentralized gaming platform Rollblock is taking the lead as the most hyped DeFi altcoin before 2025. By bringing disruptive blockchain technology to the world of online gaming, Rollblock has launched the market’s first decentralized gaming platform. Rollblock’s GameFi project has already raised more than $7.7 million in its presale, reflecting the high investor confidence in RBLK’s growth. Rollblock is setting itself apart from other DeFi altcoins by combining blockchain-level transparency with thrill and excitement. Rollblock’s GameFi ecosystem has already passed a comprehensive audit by SolidProof and has obtained an e-gaming license from Gaming Anjouan, showcasing the platform’s commitment to user security. Rollblock also encrypts all financial information and bets directly on-chain, protecting users against all kinds of data fraud and third-party manipulation. Users can sign up on Rollblock with an email address, purchase the native RBLK token with any compatible cryptocurrency, and start enjoying the thrilling games on Rollblock’s casino. Rollblock’s gaming library already features 7,000+ AI-powered games that include both casino classics and new web3-based titles like KENO and Max Car Racing. One major factor that has been key to investor interest in Rollblock soaring is how they plan to redefine the $450b a year gambling market by giving RBLK holders a share of the casino’s profits. Up to 30% of weekly profits will be shared with holders, buying back RBLK tokens from the open market. This will help boost the price of the token. 60% of the purchased RBLK will then be burned from the supply forever, creating scarcity. The other 40% will be given to RBLK stakers where they could earn APYs of 30%+ – some of the highest in the space. Rollblock’s native RBLK token is currently selling for a low price of only $0.043 in stage 9 of its presale, with analysts already projecting another price jump on Boxing Day. As Rollblock dominates the DeFi space, analysts expect the token to deliver a total of 880% returns to early investors before its official launch in early 2025. You might also like: Amid market correction, ETH, TON traders see benefits of Rollblock’s deflationary crypto Dogecoin records high network activity, Open Interest peaks Dogecoin is witnessing an impressive resurgence from its December lows, with analysts expecting an explosive rally in early 2025. Historically, Dogecoin has followed a similar trend of surging, retracing, and then skyrocketing to a record high. During Q4, Dogecoin has already recorded a 440% surge after the US Presidential election and then retraced 46% while consolidating losses. This makes January 2025 the perfect time for Dogecoin to experience massive buying activity, pushing the price beyond the $1 milestone. These optimistic predictions have increased Dogecoin’s network activity, pushing the token’s Open Interest beyond $2 million. Dogecoin is currently trading for $0.3287 after an intraday decrease of 1.85%, with analysts expecting Dogecoin to reach the $1 milestone soon. Solana faces uncertain market sentiment despite flashing recovery signal Solana has been consolidating its losses for the last few weeks after establishing a new all-time high price in November 2024. Despite Solana’s optimistic market sentiment, sudden buying pressure pushed Solana’s price below the critical $200 support. Solana is still in its corrective period but is beginning to show some signs of recovery on the SOL/USDT daily chart. Solana is currently trading for $197.67 after an intraday increase of only 0.68%. Solana’s current price is above the 100-EMA and 200-EMA trend lines which reflects some upward momentum. However, Solana’s Momentum Indicator and MACD Level are still flashing strong sell signals. Since some analysts have termed Solana as an overbought asset, Solana could experience a steeper decline toward $109.51 soon. XRP records mysterious whale activity amid market downturn XRP’s longstanding lawsuit with the US Securities and Exchange Commission was expected to end as chair Gary Gensler steps down from office. Analysts were predicting a massive XRP buying spree in early 2025. These predictions have suddenly come to a halt as an XRP whale recently transferred 30.17 million tokens to an unknown Coinbase address. Such whale activity typically suggests a profit-taking sentiment, increasing the bullish pressure on XRP’s price. XRP is currently trading for $2.28 after an intraday decrease of 1.83%. XRP’s trading volume has also decreased by 36.23% during this period, indicating low network activity. As XRP’s Momentum Indicator suggests bearish dominance, analysts expect XRP to face more uncertainty before January 2025. Rollblock to overthrow DOGE, SOL and XRP Based on historical trends, Dogecoin is gearing up for a legendary run, with analysts expecting DOGE to surpass both SOL and XRP in terms of gains. Rollblock, on the other hand, is expected to overthrow Dogecoin with its blockchain-powered GameFi project that offers real utility and scalability to investors.

38184197,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633934,1735306053,Taiwan warns that spending cuts will affect AI growth,"Taiwan’s government is furious. The Ministry of Science and Technology just announced that next year’s budget for cutting-edge fields like semiconductors, AI, and aerospace is set to shrink by T$20 billion ($609 million). This comes after opposition lawmakers pushed through a controversial law to redirect central government funds to local municipalities. The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) isn’t happy, and neither are the thousands of protesters who took to the streets last week. A second blow came from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, which warned that budget cuts could jeopardize the nation’s partnerships with global tech giants like Micron, AMD, and Nvidia . Their exact words? “Insufficient future budgets will affect Taiwan’s international AI technology partnerships.” Taiwan’s AI dominance under threat Taiwan’s tech industry isn’t just any industry. It’s the backbone of the global AI boom. In the second quarter of 2024, Its economy grew 5.09% year-over-year, driven largely by AI innovations and semiconductor manufacturing. Taiwan makes up over 90% of the world’s AI servers. The AI market forecast in the country is set to grow by 28.49% annually through 2030, potentially hitting $6.57 billion in value. But all that growth depends on funding, and that’s exactly what’s at risk. The cuts will strip T$11.6 billion from next year’s technology projects and a total of T$29.7 billion from economic initiatives. If the funding goes, so does the momentum. Corporations aren’t thrilled either. A recent survey shows that 85.1% of Taiwanese companies are eager to jump into smart healthcare collaborations, and 77.7% are heavily invested in AI tech. However, with less government support, those plans could fall apart. For a country already struggling to keep up with global software giants like Google and Microsoft, this isn’t good news. The government rolled out the Taiwan AI Action Plan 2.0 in 2023, targeting AI integration in healthcare, labor, and sustainability. They poured money into data centers and supercomputing facilities. These aren’t small projects we’re talking about. Taiwan’s AI infrastructure supports everything from advanced robotics to machine learning algorithms powering industries like healthcare, finance, and manufacturing.

38183997,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633973,1735305563,SuperTrust expands its ecosystem with the SUT QuickSwap listing,"In this post: SuperTrust (SUT) has been listed on QuickSwap V3 (Polygon). It has a liquidity score of 260, which shows investor confidence in the token. QuickSwap’s listing of SUT confirms SUT to be a viable player in the Web3 space SuperTrust (SUT) has been listed on QuickSwap V3 (Polygon) with a current price of $2.68 and a 24-hour trading volume of $339,253 (at the time of this release). It has a liquidity score of 260, which shows investor confidence in the token. SUT will reach the next phase in its evolution with the QuickSwap listing as it becomes exposed to a much wider market. Among the famous DEXs for holders of Polygon tokens, QuickSwap is also famous for liquidity, safety, and convenience for traders. SUT’s liquidity score of 260 and the high 24-hour volume are strong indicators of healthy community engagement. Given that Polygon provides very low costs for transactions on the network with fast finality time, SUT will become increasingly accessible and attractive to new users. SUT’s real-world use cases will further boost this participation and form a positive feedback loop of growing demand and sustainable token value. SuperTrust’s vision of a blockchain-integrated real economy without unethical practices resonates in every aspect of the project. SUT caps the supply of its token and transfers governance and value to market participants. This is done by eliminating foundation holdings and returning the entire token supply to circulation. At the same time, the integration of SUT into real-world applications is ensured with discounts, partnerships, and a fully formed ecosystem, which guarantee the value of the token to be retained far beyond speculation QuickSwap’s listing of SUT confirms SUT to be a viable player in the Web3 space SUT is a perfect listing for the Polygon network with leading performance and incredibly low fees, combined with quick and robust security. SuperTrust work is further aimed at decentralized finance and real-world applications, and Polygon’s infrastructure makes it possible. SuperTrust’s listing on QuickSwap demonstrates the efficacy of a transparent, community-led token, upstaging all the concerns people raise around crypto projects with more and more regulatory scrutiny and the constant lack of trust among users. The premise of SuperTrust’s ecosystem is to build trust and utility in the blockchain space. The total issuance of the SUT token is set to 238,403,732, of which 50,000,000 have already been burned. SuperTrust has transparency in the tokenomics, with 188,403,732 tokens in the circulating supply. Everything is out in the marketplace, as there is no foundation or private treasury with undisclosed amounts of tokens. Therefore, it eliminates the risks of manipulation and ensures that token value rests in actual demand and usage. Most blockchain projects have little to prove about their real-world utility, whereas SuperTrust takes a different approach by placing the SUT token at the center of everyday business and consumer transactions. SuperTrust aims to bridge traditional commerce with blockchain technology. Various services can be paid for using SUT both online and offline and at discounts ranging from 30% to 50%. This discount mechanism creates a natural reason to begin using SUT, which builds the token’s potential for being embedded in people’s daily lives. The SUPER SAVE platform also provides a blockchain-based credit trading system to replace traditional brokerage, which means cheaper yet more transparent transactions. SUPER SAVE, by moving cross-border credit functions onto a blockchain, allows a future where users and businesses may conduct transactions without relying on traditional financial intermediaries and without fear of their funds being used or lost. https://twitter.com/SuperTrust_SUT/status/1872190618346123433 MOAD is world’s first borderless global direct advertising platform for advertisers and brands to reach audiences everywhere.Through blockchain’s transparency MOAD clients can lower middlemen while also being compensated with cheaper rates by using SUT. In 2025 SuperTrust hopes to roll out NATURE BOOK, a real-time nature drawing platform to encourage user-generated content and reward SUT for participation. Participants are rewarded P2U Coins for capturing and sharing natural landscapes from around the world that can be traded for SUT. SuperTrust achieves stability and scalability by distributing tasks across four layers SuperTrust is a big proponent of architectural excellence, which is a key component of its technology stack. This multi-layered structure allows users to get involved in the ecosystem confidently and without friction. Most often referred to as the Admin Layer, the management layer takes care of all things critical to the system’s security, such as data encryption or administrative account controls. User requests driven by account management, payment security, and efficient navigation through the platform’s integrated services are processed and responded to by the service layer. The API layer, meanwhile, allows SuperTrust to integrate with other external services without any hassle and extend SuperTrust’s functionality beyond its region. The blockchain layer is built on a secure foundation that is Polygon’s efficient infrastructure and is used to execute smart contracts, issue NFT, and handle wallets. Another factor that makes SUT special amongst the many in the crowded blockchain market is its ethical standpoint. An overwhelming number of crypto tokens are heavily dependent on centralized foundations that hold large token reserves, leading to price manipulation or short-term pump-and-dump activity. On the other hand, SUT is already in full supply. Therefore, changes in price or market capitalization will stem only from user adoption and demand. This arrangement allows SUT to avoid the speculative traps common to new tokens and encourages a healthier, more stable market environment.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MATIC | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/supertrust-expands-its-ecosystem-with-the-sut-quickswap-listing/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38183997.jpeg
38183878,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398818,1735305557,Magic Eden (ME) Token Soars 20% Amid NFT Season Hype,"The post Magic Eden (ME) Token Soars 20% Amid NFT Season Hype appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Magic Eden (ME) token, a cryptocurrency focused on NFTs , is making a notable comeback. After struggling post-launch due to a massive airdrop and market volatility, the token has now risen to $4, with a market cap of $511 million. Magic Eden’s Price Surge The ME token launched to great excitement, fueled by a high-profile airdrop that captured the crypto community’s attention. This buzz drove its price to an all-time high of $13.24. However, the initial surge was followed by a sharp correction and a prolonged phase of consolidation that tested investor confidence. $ME claim starts at 2 PM GMT on December 10th Reminder: watch out for scams. Only engage & click links from official Magic Eden accounts (badged) & @MEFndn pic.twitter.com/cNvdcoki63 — Magic Eden Community (@MagicEdenComm) December 9, 2024 The ME token is now showing signs of recovery. Earlier today, its price hit $4.23 before settling at $3.97, reflecting a 10% gain in a single day and a 20% rise over the past week. Trading volume has also jumped 130% to $1.17 billion, signaling renewed investor interest and confidence. NFT Season Anticipation Sparks Optimism One of the main drivers behind the token’s recent performance is the anticipation of a strong NFT season. Magic Eden’s expanding multi-chain NFT ecosystem is drawing significant attention from both crypto enthusiasts and investors. This momentum has shifted sentiment around the token from bearish to bullish. Experts predict the NFT season could push the ME token’s price significantly higher. Some forecasts even suggest it could reach $50 as the ecosystem grows and demand for NFTs increases. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : SUI Will Outperform XRP and Solana in the 2025 Bull Run: Raoul Pal , Can ME Token Reach Its Peak Again? Despite recent gains, the ME token still needs a 70-75% increase to return to its previous high of $13.24. Technical indicators show mixed signals: while moving averages and momentum trends suggest a short-term upward trajectory, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is neutral but nearing the oversold zone. As a top NFT marketplace, Magic Eden has strong long-term growth potential. However, uncertainties remain due to the token’s recent launch and limited trading history. Even so, growing interest in NFTs may continue to drive demand and boost the token’s value. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

38186123,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323012,1735305338,"Bitget Whitepaper: Core Team to Burn 800M BGB Tokens, Making Up 40% of Supply","Cryptocurrency exchange Bitget has published a new whitepaper for its native token, Bitget Token (BGB), detailing plans to burn 800 million BGB tokens, worth over $5 billion at current market value. The core Bitget team will start with burning BGB – 40% of the total supply – reducing the circulating supply to 1.2 billion. Burning tokens is the process of removing tokens from circulation by sending them to an inaccessible wallet address, often called a “burn address.” This reduces the total supply of the token. Starting in 2025, Bitget said it will implement quarterly burns by allocating 20% of profits from its exchange and wallet operations, including revenues from spot, futures, and NFT transactions, to buy back and burn BGB. #Bitget introduces a buyback and burn plan to further enhance #BGB value for HODLers with deflationary supply. Initial Burn: with 800M tokens, worth $5B+, 40% total supply. Quarterly Burns: 20% of exchange & wallet profits. Learn more: https://t.co/HcrZJUmYLf — Bitget (@bitgetglobal) December 27, 2024 Bitget Token BGB Merges With Bitget Wallet Token BWB On Thursday, the exchange said it will merge BGB with its Bitget Wallet Token BWB. This makes BGB the unified token for Bitget’s centralized and decentralized system. Currently, BGB holders get benefits such as trading fee discounts, VIP privileges, and access to Launchpool token farming. Bitget plans to expand BGB’s use in on-chain systems making it a key asset for staking, liquidity provision, and airdrop eligibility. BGB will power Bitget Wallet services, such as multi-chain gas fee payments, while integrating into everyday PayFi scenarios. Binance Leading Centralized Exchange In the whitepaper, Bitget highlights it has rapidly emerged as the fastest-growing centralized exchange (CEX). Cryptocurrency exchange Binance continues to dominate the market, according to CCData. Binance Coin BNB is the native token for Binance’s blockchain. BNB has been made available on Revolut, Europe’s largest unicorn company. “CEXs are the backbone of crypto’s growth towards mass adoption,” said Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget, in a press release shared with CryptoNews. “Our $5 billion token burn reflects our commitment to positioning BGB as a powerful medium of value exchange. By expanding its utility on-chain and integrating it into everyday applications, we’re making PayFi a reality for the masses.” BGB Token Price Action The BGB token has shown impressive performance in 2024, with its market capitalization increasing over 1000% in the past year and more than 100-fold since its launch. On Friday, BGB is trading at $8.36 , up 11% in 24 hours, according to CryptoNews data.

38183756,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398972,1735305299,Tether Faces Delisting Risks Under EU MiCA Regulation,"The post Tether Faces Delisting Risks Under EU MiCA Regulation appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News With the European Union’s new cryptocurrency regulations set to take effect on December 30, questions remain about the future of Tether’s USDt stablecoin. This uncertainty has left exchanges and traders in the EU searching for clarity. Coinbase’s Proactive Move Sparks Debate Earlier this month, Coinbase delisted Tether’s USDt, citing concerns about compliance with the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations. Despite this decision, USDt is still being traded on other European exchanges as they await clear guidance from regulators. Platforms like Binance and Crypto.com have chosen to hold off on any action until the situation becomes clearer. Juan Ignacio Ibañez, a member of the Technical Committee of the MiCA Crypto Alliance , explained that regulators have not explicitly declared USDt non-compliant. “No regulators have explicitly stated that USDT isn’t compliant, but this does not mean that it is,” Different Approaches Among Exchanges Coinbase’s decision to delist USDt reflects a cautious approach aimed at avoiding last-minute compliance risks. Other exchanges, however, are taking a different route. According to Ibañez, exchanges might either delist USDt progressively or wait for clearer regulatory statements. Still, he cautioned that the “wait-and-see” approach could expose platforms to unnecessary risks under MiCA’s strict rules. Bloomberg recently reported that European exchanges are expected to delist USDt by December 30. However, regulators have yet to issue definitive guidance, leaving the crypto industry in a state of speculation. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : How Will Donald Trump’s Pro-Crypto Plans Impact Bitcoin Price? , Impact on Liquidity and Market Dynamics The potential removal of USDt, the most liquid stablecoin globally, has raised concerns about market liquidity. Usman Ahmad, CEO of Zodia Markets, warned that delisting USDt would limit options for EU clients and disrupt market efficiency. Stablecoins like USDt are critical for cross-border transactions, trade settlements, and market stability. Nevertheless, regulators remain wary of stablecoins due to reports of misuse. For example, Russian networks have allegedly used USDt for illegal transactions, further increasing scrutiny. In response, Tether has condemned these activities and reaffirmed its commitment to preventing misuse. What’s Next? As MiCA regulations come into force, EU exchanges may face difficult decisions regarding USDt. This situation highlights broader issues in Europe’s cryptocurrency market. Some industry leaders have warned that overly strict regulations could reduce market competitiveness and deter traders. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The Terra-Luna Crash: A Cautionary Tale It’s important to know the investor making these audacious predictions before delving into why Rexas Finance is creating such buzz. This person became well-known for precisely reporting the Terra-Luna crash, one of the most important and dramatic occurrences in the crypto market. Renowned project Terra-Luna in the distributed finance market fell apart in May 2022 after its algorithmic stablecoin UST lost its peg to the US dollar. The fall destroyed billions of dollars and impacted innumerable investors. The investor who foresaw the crisis thought UST’s lack of strong backing would cause it to fail, so his precise judgment helped him to establish a reputation for a sharp awareness of market dynamics. This same investor is currently supporting Rexas Finance, a very newcomer in the blockchain scene, with credibility. Driven by the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA), Rexas Finance attracts much interest because its creative strategy includes bonds, commodities, and real estate within the distributed world. Rexas Finance’s Presale Success and Market Potential Rexas Finance has been making headlines in the cryptocurrency market with its fast selling out of presale rounds. Rexas Finance is priced at just $0.15 per token as of writing, providing 500% gains for investors who bought at $0.03 in stage 1. $32,517,669 has been raised, which points to excellent investor trust in the promise of the enterprise. Rexas Finance has plans to list on leading exchanges in early 2025 at $0.2 when the bull run is at its peak. Should the demand for RXS tokens keep growing, it may easily propel the token into the top 100 cryptocurrencies, a momentous event that would greatly increase its exposure and draw more institutional and retail investors. Real-World Asset Tokenization: The Future of Crypto Rexas Finance distinguishes itself from other initiatives by stressing actual asset tokenization. This entails turning conventional assets—including bonds, commodities, and real estate—into digital tokens for blockchain trading. This idea has great promise since it enables people and organizations to invest in assets that were impossible to reach or demanded significant capital. Rexas Finance provides a safe and scalable platform, solving the market gap for tokenized real-world assets. As interest in distributed finance (DeFi) and blockchain technologies rises, demand for platforms that close the gap between conventional assets and cryptocurrencies will rise significantly. Rexas Finance is a user-friendly, distributed asset management and trading platform, thus positioned to profit from this trend. In addition to tokenizing real estate, Rexas Finance emphasizes high-value markets, including financial assets and commodities. Tokenizing goods, such as gold, oil, and agricultural products, has great future development potential, and Rexas Finance seeks to make these markets more accessible worldwide. Why Rexas Finance Will Join the Top 100 Rexas Finance will likely accelerate quickly since its presale figures have already shown impressive results. The investor who foresaw the Terra-Luna fall thinks the token will rank among the top 100 cryptocurrencies after its launch because of the growing need for actual asset tokenization. With its low price of $0.15, strong use case, and good tokenomics, Rexas Finance creates a perfect storm for rapid expansion. As the market recognizes its potential and more people pay attention to it, the project may rapidly acquire general acceptance, increasing its market capitalization and establishing it among the most important cryptocurrencies. Although it is currently only $0.15, Rexas Finance is quickly becoming one of the most discussed projects in the cryptocurrency market. With its creative approach to real-world asset tokenization, great presale performance, and support from an investor who precisely predicted the Terra-Luna disaster, Rexas Finance is poised for exponential expansion. As the demand for tokenized assets grows, Rexas Finance is poised to join the top 100 cryptocurrencies in weeks, giving investors a rare chance to get in early on a viable business.

38184872,https://invezz.com/?p=2407931,1735305233,Dogecoin price: what’s next after whales buy 90M DOGE?,"Whales are capitalizing on the recent market downturn, strategically scooping up Dogecoin (DOGE) at discounted prices. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, these large Dogecoin holders, believing the meme coin has yet to reach its peak potential, have accumulated over 90 million DOGE in their portfolios. Notably, these “buy the dip” transactions occurred within a brief 48-hour window. The DOGE token’s price has shown a slight positive response to this whale activity, with bulls attempting to establish a new support zone above $0.30. However, this uptick coincides with a continued decline in Dogecoin’s daily trading volume. Data from CoinGecko reveals that, despite a volume exceeding $2.4 billion, the meme coin experienced a 9% drop in trading volume over the past 24 hours. With DOGE currently priced at $0.32, the 90 million DOGE acquired by whales within the last 48 hours is valued at approximately $28 million. Dogecoin whales buy the dip Dogecoin previously reached highs of $0.48 in November, amidst a broader crypto market surge fueled by Bitcoin’s climb to a new all-time high above $100,000. Bitcoin (BTC) subsequently peaked above $108,000 before retracting to its current level near $95,600. Amidst this widespread market correction, Dogecoin fell below critical support levels at $0.40 and $0.30. This environment, marked by profit-taking across major altcoins, presented a compelling buying opportunity for whales . On December 27th, crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted this whale strategy, stating that large holders of the original dog-themed meme coin had leveraged the downturn to acquire over 90 million DOGE within 48 hours. This observation was shared on his X (formerly Twitter) account. Interestingly, this surge in Dogecoin purchases also coincided with other meme coins, like MOODENG, showing some positive price movement. What next for DOGE price? Pseudonymous crypto trader and analyst, Trader Tardigrade, suggests that the current price action for DOGE indicates a potential bottoming out. This assessment is based on bulls’ efforts to solidify support above $0.30, after a successful breakout and retest of this level. The analyst points to a spinning top candlestick pattern and the weekly RSI as key indicators of a potential upside flip. Meanwhile, Ali says the Dogecoin token is showing a potential buy signal signal on the four-hour chart. He anticipates a bounce for the meme coin.

Earlier in the week, Ali noted that whales had purchased an impressive 270 million DOGE tokens in four days. The purchase isn’t isolated though as whales have been on a Dogecoin buying spree for much of December.

38183836,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633912,1735305049,US stocks disappoint markets with weak year-end performance. But the Santa Rally is still possible,"US stocks are limping toward the finish line, leaving investors questioning whether the traditional Santa Claus Rally will make its appearance. This year’s rally window—spanning the last five trading days of December and the first two of January—opened Tuesday. The S&P 500 ticked up by 1.1% on day one but quickly lost steam, dropping a slight 0.04% on Thursday. Futures for today point to another drop, with a projected 0.4% dip at the opening bell. Historically, the Santa Claus Rally has been a reliable boost for markets. Since 1950, it has delivered an average return of 1.3%, far outshining the typical seven-day gain of 0.3%. The phenomenon was first flagged in the 1970s by Yale Hirsch in his Stock Trader’s Almanac . According to Adam Turnquist at LPL Financial, a bull run during this period usually signals stronger gains ahead, with the S&P 500 averaging a January return of 1.4% and an annual return of 10.4%. So far though, Santa seems stuck in traffic. AI leads, thematic ETFs crash, and Netflix stumbles Even if the rally doesn’t show up, the S&P 500 is set for its biggest gain over global markets since 1997. Thanks to booming artificial intelligence developments and optimism about the US economy, it’s been a year for the books—though not without turbulence. Thematic ETFs, which let investors target specific trends like cloud computing or renewable energy, have been bleeding money. About $6.5 billion flowed out of these funds in 2024, with the ARK Innovation ETF alone losing nearly $3 billion. AI was the year’s shiny new toy, and it sucked the oxygen out of the room. Some investors are already chasing the next big thing. QTUM, a quantum computing ETF that has been mostly ignored for six years, saw inflows of $260 million this month. Whether this theme has staying power or will fizzle out like past trends is anyone’s guess. Meanwhile, in South Korea, Netflix’s Squid Game failed to deliver the magic of its debut season, and the fallout was brutal. Stocks tied to the series’ success tanked. Artist United, a distributor linked to Squid Game star Lee Jung-jae, hit its daily loss limit of 30%. Wysiwyg Studios and Dexter Studios, both connected to Netflix, plunged by 25% and 24%, respectively. Delivery Hero didn’t have much holiday cheer either. The company’s attempt to offload its Foodpanda unit in Taiwan to Uber was blocked by regulators, sending its shares down 9% in Frankfurt and hitting a four-month low. Crypto’s rollercoaster Crypto isn’t sitting this one out. Bitcoin has been clawing its way back from the depths of the FTX collapse, where it fell below $16,000. Now trading near $96,000, the apex crypto is miles ahead of where it started the year, but signs of a pullback are brewing. Analysts are watching the charts closely after Bitcoin failed to break above the Fibonacci extension level of $102,734—a key psychological barrier. The weekly relative strength index (RSI) shows a bearish divergence, which tells us that the rally might be running out of gas. If Bitcoin keeps dropping, the 20-week exponential moving average (EMA) around $81,500 is the next logical target. A deeper dive could see prices testing the 50-week EMA at $67,700, a level that lines up with the 1.0 Fibonacci retracement. On the flip side, reclaiming $102,734 could set the stage for a run toward $150,000 by mid-2025, a level multiple analysts have had their eyes on. The sector’s rebound has also breathed life back into crypto jobs. Blockchain firms are hiring aggressively, and new projects are popping up. For Wall Street professionals who ditched their traditional finance gigs during the crypto winter, this is vindication.

The scam, first identified on November 14, 2024, targets users by distributing malicious software through links that mimic the legitimate Zoom interface. After digging deep, this phishing campaign has been linked to Russian-speaking hackers. The stolen funds were tracked to various crypto platforms, including Binance, Gate.io, and Bybit. Beware of phishing attacks disguised as Zoom meeting links! Hackers collect user data and decrypt it to steal sensitive info like mnemonic phrases and private keys. These attacks often combine social engineering and trojan techniques. Read our full analysis … pic.twitter.com/kDExVZNUbv — SlowMist (@SlowMist_Team) December 27, 2024 The Phishing Scheme: How Hackers Use Fake Zoom to Steal Crypto SlowMist’s investigation revealed that the attackers used the domain “ app[.]us4zoom[.]us ” to impersonate Zoom’s official web address. The phishing site closely mirrored the legitimate Zoom meeting interface, tricking users into clicking the “Launch Meeting” button. Source: SlowMist However, instead of launching a meeting, the site downloaded a malicious package named “ZoomApp_v.3.14.dmg.” Once executed, this package prompted users to enter their system password, granting the malware elevated permissions. Upon further analysis, SlowMist uncovered a hidden executable file named “.ZoomApp,” which was embedded within the installation package. Source: SlowMist This file acted as a Trojan, collecting sensitive user data, including system information, browser cookies, cryptocurrency wallet data, and KeyChain passwords. The harvested information was then transmitted to a server controlled by the hackers, and its IP address, 141.98.9.20, was traced to the Netherlands. Threat intelligence services flagged this IP as malicious. The malware employed osascript scripts to bypass macOS security measures, allowing the attackers to steal wallet mnemonic phrases and private keys. This enabled unauthorized access to victims’ crypto assets. Furthermore, the attackers bypassed traditional security defenses by using social engineering tactics and exploiting trusted software. Tracing the Stolen Funds: Hacker’s Trail Discovered SlowMist utilized its on-chain tracking tool, MistTrack, to trace the movement of stolen assets. The investigation identified a hacker address, 0x9fd15727f43ebffd0af6fecf6e01a810348ee6ac , profiting over $1 million. Stolen assets included USD0++ and MORPHO tokens, which were subsequently swapped for 296 ETH. The hacker’s address received small Ethereum transfers from 0xb01caea8c6c47bbf4f4b4c5080ca642043359c2e , an address suspected of providing transaction fees for phishing operations. This address distributed small amounts of ETH to approximately 8,800 other addresses, suggesting it might be a transaction fee platform. Further analysis revealed that part of the stolen funds was funneled to centralized exchanges, including ChangeNOW and MEXC, while 296.45 ETH was transferred to a new address, 0xdfe7c22a382600dcffdde2c51aaa73d788ebae95 . This address engaged in multiple transactions across different blockchains, with a current balance of 32.81 ETH. The remaining funds were dispersed across platforms such as Bybit, Cryptomus.com, and Swapspace. Notably, some of these transfers involved addresses flagged by MistTrack as linked to known phishing entities “Angel Drainer” and “Theft.” As a result, Slowmist advises users to exercise caution and verify meeting links before clicking. Key recommendations include: Avoid downloading software from unverified sources. Regularly update antivirus and anti-malware software. Refrain from entering system passwords for unknown applications. Monitor wallet activity and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible. Notably, a similar coordinated attack was reported earlier this month. The report indicated that Web3 workers are targeted by a sophisticated phishing campaign using fake meeting apps to steal sensitive information and crypto assets. Attention Web3 workers!

38183525,https://crypto.news/?p=14322646,1735304912,3 bullish penny tokens under $0.20 that will zoom past $2 in Q1 2025,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Rexas Finance, BONK, and Pudgy Penguins emerge as top penny tokens under $0.20, poised for explosive growth by Q1 2025 Table of Contents Rexas Finance: Enhancing tokenization BONK: The next big meme coin Pudgy Penguins: From NFTs to a global brand Why these tokens are destined for success Conclusion Smart investors seek underpriced tokens with excellent development potential as the crypto industry prepares for the next bull run. Among the several choices, three penny tokens valued at less than $0.20 have drawn the interest of traders and analysts equally: Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), BONK, and Rexas Finance (RXS). These tokens have unique qualities that will help them break past $2 and enable explosive expansion in Q1 2025. Rexas Finance: Enhancing tokenization At just $0.15, Rexas Finance is unique among tokens ready to yield remarkable profits. It has already created ripples in the crypto scene by raising over $32.5 million in its 10th presale and selling over 376.2 million tokens. Its prominence has been dramatically improved by its listing on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, which draws an increasing community of investors who view Rexas as a game-changer. Rexas distinguishes itself with its strong ecosystem, which tokenizes actual assets, including intellectual property and real estate. The platform also aids developers with its Token Builder and Launchpad, which encourage creativity and help new projects flourish within the Rexas ecosystem. The $1 million giveaway by Rexas Finance, where 20 lucky investors will each receive $50000 worth of RXS, attracts more people daily and promotes its community-driven expansion, adding to the thrill. Rexas Finance is an excellent choice for individuals trying to optimize their gains since analysts see a climb to $2 and maybe more by the end of Q1 2025. BONK: The next big meme coin Introduced initially as Solana’s first local meme coin, BONK has become progressively popular in the crypto market. Priced around $0.00003097, BONK provides low-cost access to the realm of meme tokens and gains from Solana’s lightning-fast transaction speeds and cheap costs. BONK is interesting because of its expanding application inside the Solana ecosystem. Unlike meme coins that sometimes lack physical worth, BONK is included in distributed apps (dApps) and NFTs on the Solana blockchain. Rising popularity among developers and meme coin aficionados has spurred conjecture that BONK might reach $2 as it gets more widely used. Another element explaining BONK’s optimistic view is its community-driven strategy. Regular burns, freebies, and alliances help the token to remain rather prominent in the market. BONK is positioned to ride the tide of revived interest in the ecosystem as Solana keeps bouncing and drawing developers. You might also like: Rexas Finance price forecast: where could RXS be in the next 12 months Pudgy Penguins: From NFTs to a global brand Initially well-known for its hugely popular NFT line, Pudgy Penguins entered the token market with PENGU. Priced at $0.02583 currently, the token seeks to grow the Pudgy Penguins brand outside of NFTs by building an ecosystem comprising goods, metaverse interactions, and perhaps gaming. The PENGU token is backed by a strong community that helped the NFT project succeed. Emphasizing real-world and virtual experiences, Pudgy Penguins is developing a sustainable model that is appealing to investors and collectors. The token’s deflationary mechanism and ambitious road map have triggered forecasts of a spike of over $2 by Q1 2025. Furthermore, its involvement in alliances with entertainment and gaming corporations solidifies PENGU’s status as a token to keep on. The brand is a strong candidate for notable expansion in the following months since it may be creative and relevant. Why these tokens are destined for success Any cryptocurrency’s success depends on solid foundations, increasing acceptance, and market mood. Rexas Finance leads this trio with its creative approach to tokenization, which solves practical issues and generates notable value for its users. Leveraging Solana’s technical qualities, BONK positions itself as a major competitor in the meme token market by tapping into the ongoing attractiveness of meme currency. PENGU takes advantage of Pudgy Penguins’ success by moving from NFTs to a larger ecosystem that might draw various investors. These tokens are all gained from active communities and original use cases, which helps them stand out in a congested market. These three penny tokens are positioned to profit on increased investor interest and provide exponential returns in the next few months as the market gears up for the bull run. Conclusion Among investors looking for high-potential prospects under $0.20, Rexas Finance , BONK, and Pudgy Penguins are excellent options. Rexas Finance is the best choice despite all three having the potential to surpass $2 in Q1 2025 because of its superb foundations, practical use, and expanding community. Whether you are a long-term investor or a short-term trader, these tokens present a convincing combination of affordability and growth potential, so right now is the ideal moment to act before prices skyrocket.

He disclosed in a recent analysis that XRP is ""FAVOLOSO."" FAVOLOSO in Italian means fabolus. Despite the current consolidation, EGRAG is reaffirming its conviction that an XRP rally to $27 remains in play. For context, XRP has maintained the same price range since Dec. 20, as uncertainty envelopes the broader market.The accompanying chart shows XRP's price movement above the Break of Structure (BOS). This BOS represents an important resistance level that held strong at $1.96 since April 2021. Condition Necessary for XRP to $27Interestingly, XRP broke above the structure in November 2024 amid its impressive run following Donald Trump's election victory . EGRAG suggests that the breakout above the BOS marked the start of a bullish momentum similar to what XRP experienced in 2017. However, the analyst pointed out that while XRP is holding above the BOS, the 21 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is still trending below it, currently at $0.8211. EGRAG noted that for XRP to rally toward the $27 target, the EMA must rise above the BOS and meet XRP's price above this level. XRP 1M Chart | EGRAG Crypto Data from the chart shows that past patterns preceded major price surges. In 2017, XRP experienced a massive rally to $3.31 shortly after breaking above its BOS. EGRAG suggests that the same structure is now unfolding. EGRAG has persistently maintained the XRP to the $27 target. In an August 2024 analysis, when XRP traded at $0.56, he predicted a surge to $27 . He noted that if XRP replicated even half of its 2017 rally, it could reach this level.Now, in December, XRP has followed a trajectory similar to that of the 2017 fractal. Notably, XRP's impressive 283% monthly close in November 2024 mirrors a similar 284% monthly close in March 2017, which set the stage for the upsurge that year. Now, the 21 EMA just needs to break above the BOS.XRP Current Position Meanwhile, in the short term, XRP remains in consolidation, currently changing hands at $2.255. After reaching a seven-year high of $2.9 on Dec. 3, XRP has retraced, finding support at the middle band of the Keltner Channel at $2.252. This level is important for the bulls to defend. If XRP holds this support, it could aim for the upper Keltner Channel band at $2.669, which serves as the next resistance. A breakout above $2.669 would confirm a renewal of bullish momentum and open the door to higher targets. XRP 1D Chart XRP 1D Chart However, a failure to hold the $2.252 support could see XRP test the $2 psychological level. Further downsides could push the price toward $1.96 support at the BOS and then to the lower Keltner Channel band at $1.83. Further, the Stochastic RSI indicates waning bullish momentum, with %K at 38.76 and %D at 43.24, both trending downward. This suggests a short-term bearish outlook, with bears likely to test support levels before any upward movement resumes.",POSITIVE,XRP,MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/27/top-analyst-says-xrp-is-favoloso-identifies-trigger-for-xrp-to-27/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=top-analyst-says-xrp-is-favoloso-identifies-trigger-for-xrp-to-27,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
38211170,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=114900,1735304458,Analyst Predicts Ethereum’s Q1 Strength Following Bitcoin Halving: What to Expect in 2025,"Analyst Predicts Ethereum’s Q1 Strength Following Bitcoin Halving: What to Expect in 2025 As the cryptocurrency market anticipates the effects of Bitcoin’s 2024 halving, analysts are closely watching Ethereum (ETH) for signs of historical patterns. Mister Crypto , a well-known investor with 120,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter), highlighted Ethereum’s tendency for parabolic growth in the first quarter following Bitcoin halvings. However, not all experts agree, with some cautioning that the dynamics of 2025 may differ from previous cycles. Ethereum’s Historical Performance Post-Halving Ethereum has shown remarkable growth in the first quarters following past Bitcoin halvings: Q1 2017 : Ethereum surged by over 900% , coinciding with the aftermath of Bitcoin’s 2016 halving and the emergence of the initial coin offering (ICO) boom. Q1 2021 : Ethereum climbed more than 300% , driven by the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) following Bitcoin’s 2020 halving. These patterns suggest a strong correlation between Bitcoin’s halving and Ethereum’s price performance in subsequent months, as market enthusiasm and liquidity spill over into altcoins. Will Ethereum Repeat History in Q1 2025? While Mister Crypto’s analysis leans toward optimism, other experts, including cryptocurrency media outlet U.Today , urge caution. The dynamics of 2025 present unique challenges and uncertainties: Factors Supporting Growth Bitcoin Halving Impact Bitcoin’s halving, which reduces mining rewards and limits new supply, historically boosts market sentiment. This often leads to increased liquidity, benefiting Ethereum and other altcoins. Institutional Interest Institutional adoption of Ethereum has grown significantly since 2021, with staking on Ethereum 2.0 and Layer 2 solutions potentially driving further demand. Evolving Use Cases Ethereum continues to dominate DeFi and NFT markets while expanding into new sectors like gaming and Layer 2 ecosystems, which could sustain investor interest. Factors Limiting Growth No Clear Catalysts Unlike previous cycles, there is no single defining narrative, such as ICOs or DeFi, to drive Ethereum’s price in 2025. Macro-Economic Uncertainty Global economic conditions, regulatory scrutiny, and central bank policies could impact crypto markets, dampening bullish momentum. Altcoin Competition Emerging blockchains like Solana, Avalanche, and Cardano have been gaining traction, potentially diluting Ethereum’s dominance and limiting its upside. Comparing 2025 to Previous Cycles Each Bitcoin halving cycle has occurred in a different market environment, influencing Ethereum’s performance: Cycle Halving Year Ethereum Q1 Performance Key Drivers 2016-2017 2016 +900% ICO boom, speculative altcoin rally 2020-2021 2020 +300% DeFi and NFT adoption, institutional inflows 2024-2025 2024 TBD Uncertain catalysts, competition from altcoins While history suggests potential for gains, the unique conditions of each cycle underscore the need for cautious optimism. Market Sentiment: Mixed Predictions Analysts and traders are divided on Ethereum’s outlook for Q1 2025: Bullish Camp : Proponents like Mister Crypto highlight Ethereum’s historical patterns and ongoing institutional adoption as indicators of strong potential gains. Bearish Camp : Critics, including U.Today, caution that the absence of a clear narrative and the evolving regulatory environment could limit growth this time. What Traders Should Watch For those tracking Ethereum’s Q1 2025 performance, several indicators may provide clarity: Bitcoin’s Post-Halving Momentum The strength of Bitcoin’s rally often sets the tone for altcoin performance. Staking and Liquidity Trends Increases in staked ETH and liquidity across DeFi protocols may signal market confidence. Macro-Economic Developments Interest rate policies, inflation, and global economic conditions will play a critical role in shaping market sentiment. Emerging Use Cases New innovations or applications within Ethereum’s ecosystem could provide fresh catalysts for growth. Conclusion Ethereum’s historical strength in the first quarter following Bitcoin halvings provides an optimistic precedent for Q1 2025. However, the unique challenges and uncertainties of the current market environment warrant a measured approach. While Mister Crypto’s analysis offers hope for another bullish cycle, skeptics remind investors that history may not repeat itself exactly. As the crypto market evolves, keeping an eye on Bitcoin’s performance, Ethereum’s network developments, and macroeconomic trends will be essential for navigating potential opportunities and risks.

38184255,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53211,1735304417,AVAX & DOT Hit Roadblocks: Surprising $0.12 Altcoin Triggers Shockwaves With $10.5M Presale,"Different altcoins are currently being challenged; two examples are Avalanche, denoted as AVAX, and Polkadot (DOT). Whereas there is increased volatility within the market for these major cryptocurrencies, an alternative newcomer, DTX Exchange (DTX), has participated impressively in its presale activity. Priced at only twelve cents ($0.12), DTX has raised more than ten point five million dollars ($10.5 million) during its sixth stage, attracting attention from those seeking investment openings in a rocky market. Market Struggles and Opportunities: Avalanche (AVAX) and Polkadot (DOT) Face Price Fluctuations Amid Economic Uncertainty Recently, Avalanche (AVAX), a layer-1 blockchain system known because of decreased transaction costs and increased volumes, has undergone a series of price fluctuations. AVAX started well in December but felt an impact of general market sell-offs later in the month, dropping below $35, only to recover slightly to around $38. In the past few years, AVAX has shown bullish sequences. However, analysts argue that it is this time round when most traders prefer other better-established options due to prevailing economic situations. Similarly, Polkadot (DOT) is facing challenging times, even though it closed the previous month on a high note, it has to keep its price stable at $8 to allow for more upside potential. Currently, DOT is exchanging hands at $7, which doesn’t look that good compared to most alternative coins (altcoins). While trying to keep their positions during market fluctuations, AVAX and DOT are attracting less the attention of investors who want to make more money from new projects. DTX Exchange Has a Revolutionary Hybrid Model and High-Profit Potential DTX Exchange has appropriated itself as the game-changing crypto trading area. Trading at $0.12 at the presale stage 6, DTX has raised $10.5 million so far because the demand from people willing to invest here is high. The next phase will be selling tokens at $0.14, an ideal time for first investors to get their investments covered before prices escalate further. DTX stands out from known altcoins such as AVAX and DOT because of its unmatched hybrid trading model, which marries conventional financial instruments with blockchain technology. Using this approach, one can easily trade different types of assets while benefiting from fast transaction speeds above 100,000 transactions per second, making it faster than Solana and others. DTX also has tremendous potential for generating large profits when used responsibly–it allows traders to participate in transactions with leverages up to 1000x. This quality of speed and leverage makes it a better option than most other investments apart from conventional altcoins. DTX Token Poised for Exponential Growth: Deflationary Model and Market Potential Set for a Breakout in 2025 Everyone is excited for DTX Exchange to launch at $0.20 in the chief exchanges as it steams ahead. It is projected that this token will undergo exponential progress hence achieving a 100x increase by the beginning of 2025 by tapping into the next bull cycle and raising retail interest. The private offering success depicts how much investors believe in DTX’s new capability and progressive nature. In addition, DTX’s deflationary currency system makes it more interesting for those who may wish to put their money in it. This occurs through the reduction of currency in circulation by DTX as time progresses, aiming to stimulate an increase in prices when demand rises, making it an enticing offer for someone looking forward to huge profits in the future. Opposite to the aversion Avalanche and Polkadot are currently grappling with in market sentiments and price volatility, DTX seems prepared for a breakout because it has attracted traders whose recent losses with the well-known alternative coins have discouraged them. Conclusion Ultimately, whilst Avalanche (AVAX) and Polkadot (DOT) remain caught up in fluctuating market situations, DTX Exchange offers a more attractive option for people looking to invest their money in something with more chances of growing rapidly. Since its innovative trading platform will be going live soon and it has managed to perform well even before being launched through presales; hence there might be changes about what investing in cryptocurrencies means during times of uncertainty by availing DTX. Going forward towards 2025, everyone is considering how this promising alternative coin will steer through this changing cryptocurrency environment and its ability to realize its audacious growth targets.

So, both are set to do well next year. However, investors are turning to a new DeFi token for even higher returns. This new DeFi token is none other than DTX Exchange (DTX). The new DeFi token offers great utility, access to a platform with incredible speed, and a 50x profit by Q1 of 2025! AAVE’s Price Makes a Double-Digit Comeback AAVE has made a remarkable turnaround. Namely, it rose by over 13% in less than a day. This rise makes AAVE one of the best crypto performers right now. Of course, AAVE’s recovery was driven by the wider market sentiment. However, AAVE investors also played a part in this. Namely, they pushed AAVE even further, which is why it rose so much in such a short time. Since the AAVE community is so involved, experts think they’ll push this DeFi token even further soon. More specifically, they see AAVE’s price rising by another 50% very soon. But they’re also noticing that AAVE investors are paying more attention to DTX Exchange. This could imply that they’re much more confident in this new DeFi token! Ethereum is Also Recovering After the Market Dip ETH’s price rose by over 3% in a day. This is great for Ethereum, signaling further rises. However, Ethereum investors seem to be a bit more involved this time around. So, experts say they can push ETH’s price further soon. Namely, they think that ETH’s price can reach $5,000 soon. After this, they foresee Ethereum’s price reaching a high of $15,937. However, experts say that this will be the top for Ethereum. Also, they see it happening by May 2025. The reason why they think it will be the top for Ethereum is because they see massive profit-taking at that level. Ethereum investors would make huge returns, so they’ll hurry to secure them before it’s too late. With this in mind, experts see DTX Exchange as a much more promising investment opportunity than ETH. And ETH investors agree. So, they’ve been investing in this DeFi token heavily before its launch! DTX Exchange is Revolutionizing Trading With a Unique Platform DTX Exchange is a cutting-edge new trading platform. As such, it brings huge utility and benefits for traders, which is why experts and investors are so confident in its DeFi token. For one, DTX Exchange gives you access to thousands of different assets. It also lets you trade them with up to 1,000x leverage. With this offer, you can turn even the smallest of trades into huge profits. Furthermore, DTX Exchange comes with unparalleled speeds. Namely, it uses the VulcanX blockchain to bring 100,000 TPS to its traders. This is an amazing speed, trumping Solana’s 600 TPS. It also allows you to get incredible entries and exits on your trades. So, you can boost your profits even further with this great new platform! DTX Exchange also has its own wallet called the Phoenix Wallet. It lets you manage all your assets from one place. This will make your whole trading journey much simpler! Additionally, DTX Exchange offers something that’s quite rare in the market right now. Namely, it offers a great fair launch system. While most new DeFi token projects are backed by VCs and whales, DTX Exchange isn’t. Instead, it’s currently supported by over 300,000 smaller investors, and the number is growing with each day. So, no one gets to manipulate the price or ruin the price chart, which has happened a lot with new DeFi token projects! Invest in the DTX DeFi Token Now and Reap 50x Gains Soon! Right now, DTX is in Stage 6 of its public presale. So, at this stage, the DeFi token is available for $0.12. This price will go to $0.14 once Stage 7 begins, which will be very soon. That’s because Stage 6 of the DTX public presale is over 90% done. So, you’ll have to hurry to catch DTX at $0.12. After the presale wraps up, DTX will launch at $0.20. This is also when DTX’s rally will officially start. Experts say that the rally will be fueled greatly by the 2025 bull run and DTX’s great utility. So, they see DTX’s price rising by 50x in Q1 and even more throughout the year!

38186121,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323022,1735304394,Solana Price Dips 3% With $3.5 Billion Volume – Is $300 Still Within Reach?,"Solana (SOL) has faced a challenging week so far, dropping 11.4% from December 18 to 24, reflecting broader bearish market sentiment. As of now, SOL trades at $190.75, down 3% in the last 24 hours. Despite a substantial $91.46 billion market cap, critical metrics like DeFi Total Value Locked (TVL) fell to $8.239 billion, signaling waning investor engagement. Yet, Solana’s decentralized exchange (DEX) ecosystem showed resilience. DEX volume climbed 5.76% to $30.486 billion, outperforming Ethereum for the third consecutive month. Solana’s competitive edge, including low fees and fast transaction speeds, continues to attract DeFi users. However, with prices remaining below the $194 resistance, the risk of further declines toward $180 or even $168 looms large. Bitget Wallet: Empowering Solana Traders with Automation Solana’s ecosystem recently received a boost with Bitget Wallet introducing limit order functionality, powered by Jupiter, a DEX aggregator. This innovative feature automates trades, enabling users to set price thresholds to optimize transactions during volatile market conditions. Key Features of Solana Limit Orders: Automated Execution: Trades trigger when target prices are met. Customizable Settings: Users can set expiration times and cancel conditions. Enhanced Liquidity: Jupiter aggregates liquidity from multiple DEXs for optimal prices. Alvin Kan, COO of Bitget Wallet, highlighted that the feature reduces trading stress by addressing the challenges of rapid market swings. By integrating Solana, Bitget Wallet strengthens its position as a leader in multi-chain wallet trading, supporting over 100 blockchains. Solana: Market Insights and Technical Outlook Current Price: $190.75 (down 3% intraday). Market Cap: $91.46 billion. 24-Hour Trading Volume: $3.5 billion. DeFi TVL: $8.239 billion. Daily Active Addresses: >5 million. On the 2-hour chart, Solana is forming a descending triangle pattern below the 50-period EMA, signaling bearish pressure. Immediate resistance stands at $194, with breakouts potentially targeting $201.75 and $211.72. On the downside, key supports lie at $180.63 and $174.97. RSI at 48 suggests neutral momentum but favors sellers below $194. Conclusion Solana’s short-term outlook remains bearish, but features like Bitget Wallet’s automation tools could support ecosystem growth and attract traders. As volatility persists, investors should monitor resistance at $194 and brace for potential sharp moves in either direction. SOLX Presale Gains Momentum While Solana’s price has remained relatively stable, there’s an emerging opportunity that has captured the attention of investors. Solaxy’s native token, $SOLX, has seen a remarkable presale success, raising over $6.22 million in a short period. This layer-two solution for the Solana blockchain promises to solve scalability issues by providing zero congestion, errors, and delays — addressing the ongoing congestion Solana has faced. As interest grows in meme coins and the Solana ecosystem, Solaxy’s innovative solution could offer the scalability needed for the network’s future growth. With the presale ending soon, the strong capital raise suggests substantial demand for $SOLX once it hits decentralized exchanges (DEXs). In addition to the excitement around the presale, the early success of Solaxy could also lead to potential listings on major centralized exchanges (CEXs), further boosting its prospects. To purchase $SOLX , simply visit the Solaxy website, connect your wallet, and make a purchase using ETH, USDT, or BNB. Alternatively, you can pay with a bank card.

Wood’s flagship ARK Innovation exchange-traded fund (ARKK.P) has surged 17% since Trump’s election victory, fueled by expectations of policies that could benefit its holdings. Electric carmaker Tesla and crypto exchange Coinbase, two of ARKK’s key stocks, have already gained 54% and 7% respectively since Nov. 6, compared to a 1.7% rise in the S&P 500. ARKK’s other major holdings, including Robinhood and Block, stand to gain from friendlier crypto and AI policies under Trump’s administration. Wood has publicly supported Trump’s economic platform, emphasizing its focus on innovation, deregulation, and cost reductions. “I see them saying, okay, we’re going to cut taxes but we will make them retroactive to Jan. 1, 2025. That would be very helpful, I think, in terms of providing certainty for the markets,” Wood stated. She warned that without retroactive tax cuts, companies and individuals might hold back on spending or investments. While Wood does not generally support tariffs, she views Trump’s tariff threats as a negotiating strategy. Tax Reform and Pro-Innovation Policies on the Horizon Trump is expected to implement key policies through executive orders after his Jan. 20 inauguration, while a Republican-controlled Congress pursues tax reform. Although Wood did not financially back Trump in the 2024 election cycle, she has been in contact with Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Senator Cynthia Lummis, both of whom are shaping Trump’s pro-innovation agenda. Wood remains optimistic about AI and autonomous technologies, describing them as key drivers of investment returns. “We’re telling people that, hey, we offer a highly differentiated exposure to innovation. Yes, we’re going to be volatile,” Wood acknowledged.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/cathie-wood-urges-trump-administration-to-boost-growth-with-retroactive-tax-cuts/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

""It Will Overtake XRP and Solana!""","Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal, who stated in his previous statements that he was turning to altcoins rather than Bitcoin, announced the altcoin for which he expects an explosive rise. In a recent video, he claimed that SUI will outperform many altcoins throughout the remainder of the bull run. The famous millionaire said that SUI will outperform XRP and Solana (SOL) in the coming months, leaving both of them behind. Following this rise expectation, Pal stated that there was a bullish pattern in the SUI chart, and that an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern was formed in the SUI chart. According to Pal, this pattern indicates a significant rise potential. While Pal noted that confidence in Solana remains and that Solana continues to strengthen, he argued that shifting some of the investment from Solana to SUI could yield better returns. “Solana is the more proven, second cycle protocol and is likely to perform well, But SUI, which is newer and riskier, looks set to explode at this stage of the market.” On the SUI-XRP comparison, Pal said, “We have reached the bottom of the trend channel for SUI and it is likely to outperform XRP from now on.” However, the famous name stated that this prediction does not mean that XRP will fall, but that SUI will provide better returns to its owners. While Pal believes SUI will outperform, he also acknowledged XRP’s bullish potential, saying, “XRP’s weekly chart has broken the 7-year giant wedge and it’s unclear where this could go. Very strong.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Famous Millionaire Raoul Pal Reveals His New Favorite Altcoin!

38183475,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633914,1735304149,The Federal Reserve desperately tries to decode Trump pre-inauguration,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is tiptoeing through a minefield as Donald Trump barrels toward his second term as president. The central bank is trying to maintain its image of neutrality while secretly bracing for the economic chaos Trump’s policies could unleash. Powell claims the Fed won’t speculate on Trump’s plans, but insiders reportedly say a different game is being played behind the scenes. After Trump’s November win, Powell went on the defensive, insisting the Fed wouldn’t adjust interest rates based on “guesswork” about future trade and immigration policies. “We don’t guess, we don’t speculate, and we don’t assume,” Powell announced at a press conference. But as the dust settles, the Fed’s actions suggest otherwise. Trump’s upcoming term is already affecting its inflation forecasts and interest-rate decisions. Fed’s mixed signals Last week, the Fed cut rates by another quarter point, making a full percentage point cut since September. Powell’s message was that the economy still needs some help. But projections released alongside the cut show a more hawkish stance for the future. Officials are now predicting only two rate cuts in 2025 and two more in 2026, down from earlier expectations of four cuts next year. The inflation numbers don’t help. The Fed now expects inflation (excluding volatile food and energy prices) to dip to 2.5% in 2025, worse than the 2.2% forecast just months ago. And here’s the thing: 15 out of 19 Fed officials now believe inflation could overshoot their forecasts. Back in September, only three saw that risk. Behind closed doors, Fed officials are sweating over the potential for Trump’s trade and immigration policies to undo recent progress. Powell, however, is playing coy, pointing to firmer inflation readings as the culprit. Meanwhile, the labor market and supply chains—two big factors in the inflation cool-down—could unravel. Powell himself admitted during a press conference that the Fed’s current-year inflation projections had “kind of fallen apart.” Trump’s immigration policies loom large over inflation Trump’s plans to crack down on immigration have Fed officials especially worried. His promises of mass deportations and stricter border controls could shrink the labor pool, tighten the job market, and send wages soaring. The supply-side expansion, which had been keeping inflation in check, could be thrown into reverse. Governor Adriana Kugler, known for her hawkish tendencies, hasn’t been shy about her concerns. While she backed a half-point rate cut in September, she recently hinted that further easing might not be possible if labor-force growth stalls. The Fed’s models show a tight labor market could lead to higher prices, putting pressure on businesses to pass those costs to consumers. Powell, however, has been trying to keep his colleagues from linking Fed policies directly to Trump’s moves. Behind the scenes, he’s urging restraint, hoping to avoid the appearance of political bias. “We need to focus on the data, not the politics,” Powell reportedly told colleagues. The memory of 2018 is fresh in many minds. During Trump’s first term, his trade war forced the Fed to lower rates to offset its economic impact. But this time, things are different. Inflation is no longer an abstract threat. Businesses and consumers are already wary of rising prices, making the Fed’s job even trickier. Stress tests expose cracks in the banking system While inflation and labor concerns dominate headlines, the Fed is also grappling with cracks in the banking system. The 2023 panic among mid-sized banks exposed weaknesses in the system’s ability to handle rapid rate hikes. Stress tests, once a key tool for assessing banks’ resilience, have become a point of contention. In 2019, the Fed proposed opening up its test models to public scrutiny, arguing it would make the system more transparent. Banks pushed back, claiming the models were too rigid and encouraged “gaming” the system. The Fed eventually scrapped the idea, citing concerns over a “model monoculture.” But the debate hasn’t gone away. Banks argue that without consistent rules, they can’t make meaningful long-term changes to their portfolios. And the lawsuit filed this week against the Fed’s stress test framework only adds to the pile. Critics believe the tests are redundant, given the Fed’s other capital requirements, and could even encourage reckless behavior.

The next prominent inclusion could be the rising altcoin DTX Exchange, which has taken the spotlight among emerging crypto projects and has become the fastest-growing token presale of 2024, with over $10 million raised due to huge demand. Listing on popular exchanges like Robinhood after the presale will generate massive demand for DTX Exchange and can induce a surge like the recent ADA rally. Will Cardano (ADA) Correct Further Or Undergo Trend Reversal? The broader crypto market was uncertain due to regulatory issues, and Cardano had traded sideways for over three months. When pressure from the SEC subsided, the market sentiment quickly turned bullish. Due to enormous demand, the ADA price broke out from the range-bound price action, and a rally started. Cardano gained over 300% in a month, but the momentum slowly declined due to reduced demand. ADA could not push past the $1.25 resistance level and consolidated below it for a week. After this, bears gained control and pulled the price to the $0.91 price level. Source: CoinMarketCap ADA recovered from this support level but again faced rejection from $1.13 and has dropped to the $0.86 support level. The Cardano price has been moving in the $0.86-$0.95 range for the past few days and has fallen below the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) today. In the last 24 hours, Cardano has plunged 3.5% and trades at $0.891, with a 27% decline in trading volume. The MACD oscillator for ADA has dropped below the baseline, indicating increasing bearish pressure. Cardano may continue to fall and correct to the 100-day SMA unless there is a sudden sentiment shift. DTX Exchange: Next-Generation Trading Platform The DTX Exchange aims to create a secure, transparent, and inclusive investment environment where investors from all locations and backgrounds can easily access the global financial markets. Thus, it promotes financial inclusion by helping remove restrictions based on geography, nationality, or economic status. It is bridging the gap between traditional and DeFi assets by adopting a hybrid approach. DTX Exchange merges the best characteristics of centralized and decentralized exchanges to offer a unified trading hub with over 120,000 financial assets, including stocks, bonds, forex, crypto, etc., with top-notch blockchain security measures. Moreover, DTX Exchange solves the prevalent liquidity issues by implementing liquidity pools. It piles liquidity from multiple sources, such as liquidity providers and external exchanges so that traders can transfer assets more efficiently and with reduced slippage. Thus, traders can place large-size orders with minimal impact on the average price, even during periods of high trading activity. DTX Token Shaping the Ecosystem The native token DTX is a crucial element of the ecosystem. To align the platform’s development with the community’s needs, it empowers token holders with governance rights, allowing them to present their unique views and influence important decisions. Token holders can propose upgrades for features or updates for new or existing functionalities. When someone submits a proposal, DTX holders can vote on it to express their approval or rejection. The voting mechanism is designed to give more weight to users who hold more tokens. It also keeps the process transparent to maintain the community’s trust in the ecosystem. DTX is in the sixth stage of the presale, and the token’s value has surged tremendously from $0.02 in the first stage to $0.12 in the current stage. However, it is still highly undervalued, as DTX will launch for $0.20 after the presale. The seventh stage is just around the corner, and the token price will surge again to $0.14 within a few days.

DTX Exchange offers a hybrid trading model that combines the best elements of centralized and decentralized exchanges to offer the best of both worlds. As of today, DTX has crossed $10.56 million in its presale. Dogecoin (DOGE) Downtrend To End Soon Dogecoin is most likely stabilizing at the current price levels, and as the RSI indicates, things may finally improve. Everybody is wondering if this stabilization signals the end of its downward trend or if more drops are on the horizon. The fact that DOGE is currently trading below its 50 EMA, which is located at about $0.36, indicates that the asset is having difficulty regaining its bullish momentum. There is not much selling pressure as the RSI (Relative Strength Index) is still trading close to 42 despite the recent decline. However, it is important to remember that the RSI has not yet entered oversold territory, so more declines may be possible before a possible recovery. Earlier in December, the price pattern broke out of its ascending channel and now displays a descending structure. Source: TradingView Due to this breakdown, DOGE is now closer to its 100 EMA, which is at about $0.28 and may serve as a crucial support level if there are any more declines. If the price breaks through this barrier, the 200 EMA, which is close to $0.22 and would indicate a significant trend reversal if it were reached, would be the next important support to keep an eye on. Trading Volume Surge In PEPE Pulls Investors PEPE, the frog-themed meme coin, is witnessing massive activity on the cryptocurrency market that could signal bullish sentiment. In the past 24 hours, over 1.14 trillion PEPE have been traded in a move that signals renewed interest in the asset. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the market volume of PEPE has soared by 19.74% to $2.13 billion. This spike in trading volume occurred as investors and traders alike moved to take positions in anticipation of a possible market rally. Notably, the increased interest has triggered a price surge for PEPE. At the time of writing, PEPE is exchanging hands at $0.00001868. This represents a 2.15% increase as the meme coin fights to maintain price stability. In earlier trading, the PEPE price soared to $0.00001941 before experiencing mild fluctuations due to market dynamics. However, the token has found $0.0000185 to be a crucial support level as it has traded above that mark so far despite fluctuations. DTX Exchange (DTX) Slams Memecoin Sector With $10.56M Presale The mind-blowing deFi platform has done it again. A powerful presale rally in DTX Exchange ’s ongoing presale rally has stormed the crypto market. DTX offers the ultimate solution for seamless and secure asset management.

38182939,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633895,1735303203,"Ethiopia uses GERD, Africa’s largest dam for Bitcoin mining – Revenue hits 18%","As the year nears the end, Bitcoin has set up shop in the middle of East Africa. Ethiopia used its hydroelectric power, produced by the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), to facilitate Bitcoin mining. To that end, Ethiopian Electric Power (EEP) has converted latent energy into valuable digital assets, generating a revenue of 18%. Hiwot Eshetu, EEP’s marketing and business development director, asserted that Ethiopia’s grid is not yet developed and that much of the dam’s energy would otherwise go to waste . He added, “ Bitcoin miners have a lot of money to invest, and we need lots of money to develop our grid, so it’s a win-win.” GERD is Africa’s largest dam, and using it for Bitcoin sets up crypto for major adoption within Africa. According to reports, spending $1 billion on Bitcoin mining activities over the past year exceeded the profits generated from exporting power to neighboring countries. In addition, Ethiopia has monetized its surplus of electricity. Over the course of a few months, the country has generated tens of millions of dollars in income. This has been made possible by securing deals with 25 BTC mining enterprises. EEP reported generating over $55 million in revenue in the past 10 months from deals with the mining companies, underscoring the sector’s economic potential. These agreements have also attracted international miners. Ethiopia’s crypto stance and its economic effects Ethiopia’s electricity rates, at about 3.2 cents per kilowatt-hour, are among the lowest in the world. This makes it appealing to miners who are looking for affordable options. The relocation of Chinese miners following Beijing’s prohibition of crypto mining in 2021 has been the catalyst for Ethiopia’s strategic ascent in Bitcoin mining. BitFuFu and BIT mining, both sponsored by Bitmain, are notable investments that have supported Ethiopia’s expanding industry. A 51 MW Bitcoin mine and 17,869 mining machines were recently acquired by BIT Mining for $14.3 million. This is a significant milestone in the sector. Notably, Ethiopia’s mining operations presently consume approximately 600 MW of energy. However, its proportion of the global Bitcoin rate could potentially increase to 7% as a result of this expansion. Ethiopia has entered the rankings of the top Bitcoin mining nations, which include the Czech Republic, China, and the United States. It is anticipated that the country’s share of the global rate will increase as it expands its operations. This will further solidify its position in the crypto industry. However, the development of Ethiopia’s ambitious initiatives also underscores the broader repercussions of Bitcoin mining and its impact on green energy policy. What Bitcoin mining is doing for Africa In other regions of Africa, the integration of Bitcoin mining with renewable energy initiatives has resulted in substantial environmental and social impacts. In Kenya and Zambia, microgrids that operate on renewable energy sources are providing electricity to rural communities. As a result, it is facilitating the development of previously neglected regions. At the same time, the renowned Virunga National Park in the DRC employs Bitcoin mining to fund environmental initiatives. The park generates substantial monthly revenue by using hydroelectric power. This revenue is then allocated to maintaining infrastructure, paying staff wages, and supporting local businesses, such as cacao processing. However, there are apprehensions that wealthy crypto operations will exploit Africa’s emerging power-production capacity. This could happen if governments are attracted to the lucrative financial incentives. In February 2024, Angola enacted a bill prohibiting crypto-mining operations to protect the nation’s energy security. On the other hand, CNF has previously emphasized that public Bitcoin miners worldwide have amassed $5 billion in 2024 and have reinvested $3.6 billion in infrastructure and hardware development.

38211169,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=114902,1735303136,Bitwise Executive Predicts Less Than 10% Chance of U.S. Bitcoin Reserve in 2025,"Bitwise Executive Predicts Less Than 10% Chance of U.S. Bitcoin Reserve in 2025 Jeffrey Park, portfolio manager and head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, has cast doubt on the likelihood of the U.S. government establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve in 2025. Posting on X (formerly Twitter), Park estimated the probability at less than 10%. He further argued that such a move would be the only plausible catalyst for Bitcoin’s price to surge past $1 million next year. What Is a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve? A strategic Bitcoin reserve would involve the U.S. government holding Bitcoin as part of its national reserves, akin to how it manages gold. Proponents believe such reserves could serve as: A Hedge Against Inflation : Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it a potential store of value in an inflationary environment. A Geopolitical Tool : Bitcoin reserves could offer the U.S. leverage in an increasingly digital global economy. A Diversified Asset : Adding Bitcoin to reserves would diversify the U.S. government’s portfolio, aligning with growing institutional adoption. However, the idea remains speculative and controversial, with critics pointing to Bitcoin’s volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and its untested role as a reserve asset. Why Park Predicts Low Probability Jeffrey Park outlined several reasons for his skepticism about the U.S. introducing a Bitcoin reserve: 1. Regulatory Uncertainty The U.S. government has taken a cautious approach to cryptocurrency regulation, focusing on curbing illicit activity and ensuring market stability. A strategic Bitcoin reserve would require a dramatic policy shift. 2. Bitcoin’s Volatility Bitcoin’s price swings make it a risky addition to national reserves. Governments typically prioritize stability in reserve assets, such as U.S. Treasury bonds or gold. 3. Political Resistance Adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset would likely face pushback from lawmakers and traditional financial institutions wary of legitimizing an unregulated digital currency. 4. Competition with CBDCs The U.S. is exploring the development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). A Bitcoin reserve could conflict with this effort by endorsing a decentralized, non-sovereign asset. Bitcoin at $1 Million: A Distant Prospect? Park’s assertion that a strategic Bitcoin reserve is the only catalyst for Bitcoin to reach $1 million next year underscores the speculative nature of such predictions. Here’s why: Potential Drivers for Bitcoin’s Price Surge Institutional Demand Growing adoption by institutions, fueled by spot Bitcoin ETFs and increased legitimacy, could drive prices higher, though likely not to $1 million. Global Economic Instability If fiat currencies face crises, Bitcoin could emerge as a safe haven asset, attracting significant capital inflows. Technological and Market Innovation Advancements in Bitcoin’s infrastructure, such as the Lightning Network, could enhance adoption and utility. Why $1 Million Is Unlikely in 2025 Market Cap Constraints : At $1 million per Bitcoin, the total market cap would exceed $20 trillion, requiring a massive influx of capital. Economic Context : Such a dramatic price surge would likely require extreme economic turmoil or hyperinflation, conditions not currently on the horizon. Global Context: Are Bitcoin Reserves Realistic? While the U.S. is unlikely to adopt a Bitcoin reserve soon, other countries have shown interest in Bitcoin as a strategic asset: 1. El Salvador El Salvador has already incorporated Bitcoin as legal tender and holds Bitcoin in its national reserves, though its economy is much smaller and less influential than the U.S. 2. Emerging Markets Countries facing inflation or currency instability, such as Turkey and Argentina, could explore Bitcoin reserves as a hedge against economic uncertainty. 3. Private Sector Momentum Even if governments remain hesitant, corporations and private institutions continue to accumulate Bitcoin, influencing its adoption and price trajectory. Challenges to Establishing a U.S. Bitcoin Reserve Public Perception Bitcoin’s association with speculative trading and illicit activity could make its adoption politically contentious. International Competition Countries like China, which maintain strict control over digital assets, may oppose U.S. Bitcoin reserves, viewing them as a threat to financial stability. Market Dynamics Accumulating Bitcoin at a national scale could significantly disrupt the market, leading to price volatility and potential supply constraints. Conclusion Jeffrey Park’s prediction of a less than 10% chance for a U.S. Bitcoin reserve in 2025 reflects the significant hurdles facing such a proposal. While a strategic Bitcoin reserve could theoretically propel the cryptocurrency to unprecedented heights, the political, regulatory, and economic realities make it an unlikely scenario in the short term. As the crypto market matures, discussions around Bitcoin’s role in national reserves may gain traction, but for now, its adoption by the U.S. government remains speculative at best.

Bitcoin mining is being fueled by renewable energy in Africa, helping spur economic growth and fund important conservation projects like the one in Virunga. Ethiopia Using Bitcoin Mining To Generate Revenue Ethiopia is leveraging its enormous hydroelectric power, primarily from the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) for Bitcoin mining. This has helped the country generate 18% of Ethiopian Electric Power (EEP) income from Bitcoin mining, turning idle energy into a profitable asset. A staggering $1 billion has been spent on mining in the past year, significantly more than earnings from electricity exports. “Africa’s Crypto Power Play: Where Energy Meets the Blockchain Africa’s got the juice - and crypto’s tapping in. Ethiopia’s Grand Renaissance Dam is flipping unused power into digital gold, with 18% of Ethiopian Electric Power’s sales now coming from Bitcoin mining. That’s a billion bucks invested in a year, outpacing exports to neighboring countries. Elsewhere, mining is funding real impact: micro-grids, lighting up rural Kenya and Zambia, and even Virunga Park in DRC is mining crypto to bankroll conservation. Africa? Keep your eyes on its crypto space in 2025.” Ethiopia’s Energy Strategy Ethiopia has secured agreements with over 25 mining businesses, allowing the government to generate millions of dollars in just a few months. The agreements have attracted several international miners to the country and helped it generate revenue from its excess electricity. Ethiopia’s electricity tariffs are among the most competitive globally, a big draw for miners looking for reasonably priced locations for their Bitcoin mining operations. As a result, Ethiopia has established itself as a leader in Bitcoin mining activity, attracting a flood of investments, particularly from Chinese miners following the ban in China . The country has emerged as a hub for Bitcoin mining, having generated over $55 million in ten months. The remarkable growth and financial return can be attributed to the country’s abundant energy resources. Kal Kassa, Founder and Educator at Bitcoin Birr, stated, “Ethiopia is becoming a major hub for Bitcoin mining due to our extremely competitive electricity prices. At just 3.2 cents per kilowatt-hour, our electricity is much cheaper than many other parts of the world.” Renewable Energy And Bitcoin Mining Are Making A Difference Combining Bitcoin mining with renewable energy initiatives has also had a profound impact environmentally and socially. Microgrids running on renewable energy have been supplying electricity to rural communities in Kenya and Zambia, enabling developments in highly neglected areas. The famous Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is using Bitcoin mining to support environmental projects. Virunga makes a significant monthly income through hydroelectric power and uses it to support local businesses, pay staff wages, and maintain the park’s infrastructure. Several countries are using Bitcoin mining for transformational purposes. This highlights how renewable energy sources combined with Bitcoin and crypto mining operations could help achieve economic development. As these operations develop and grow, they demonstrate the influence of Bitcoin mining on green energy and economic policy. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

With each passing month, investors are constantly on the lookout for the next big thing that could potentially bring high returns. This month isn’t any different, and some altcoins are gaining traction faster than expected. Qubetics ($TICS) has been creating buzz, especially with its presale progressing rapidly. Its unique approach and strategic collaborations seem to be filling gaps that many other cryptos couldn’t. As the 14th presale stage nears its end, the price is set to rise by 10% this weekend. For those looking at altcoins with potential, $TICS isn’t one to ignore. Let’s break down why Qubetics and six other altcoins deserve attention right now. 1. Qubetics ($TICS) Gears Up for Major Growth in Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics isn’t your typical altcoin project. It’s building a robust platform aimed at making cross-border transactions faster and cheaper. Businesses across different industries face challenges with traditional payment systems that are slow and burdened with high fees. Qubetics provides a seamless solution by allowing almost-instant transfers with minimal costs, which could reshape how international businesses operate. Consider a freelance designer in New York working with clients across Europe. Payment delays through conventional platforms can disrupt operations. Qubetics steps in by enabling fast, direct transfers, keeping projects on track without the usual hassle. This kind of real-life application makes $TICS practical and appealing. On top of that, Qubetics recently joined forces with SWFT Blockchain to refine its wallet technology. This upgrade means users can manage multiple cryptocurrencies with greater ease, enhancing security and efficiency. The presale has already sold over 376 million $TICS , raising $7.8 million from more than 11,800 investors. With prices increasing every Sunday at 12 am, grabbing $TICS now before the next 10% hike could prove to be a smart move. Why this coin made it to this list – Qubetics’ dedication to solving real-world problems, combined with its partnerships and rapid presale growth, positions it as one of the top altcoins for significant returns. 2. Toncoin (TON) Makes Strides in Decentralized Communication Toncoin, the driving force behind The Open Network (TON), is pushing boundaries in decentralized communication. Originally developed by Telegram, Toncoin aims to provide secure, efficient services that rival traditional messaging platforms. This isn’t just about sending texts; Toncoin’s ecosystem allows for decentralized apps and smart contracts, providing a range of tools for developers. The project has gained momentum, with its value climbing past the $8 mark recently. This upward movement reflects a growing interest in decentralized communication, particularly as privacy becomes more important. Investors are seeing potential in TON’s broader application beyond messaging, making it a key player in this space. Why this coin made it to this list – Toncoin’s association with Telegram and its focus on decentralized applications make it a compelling addition for investors eyeing high returns. 3. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Shows DeFi Can Still Surprise Hyperliquid has been making noise in decentralized finance (DeFi) circles. Despite lacking major exchange listings, this new altcoin has surged over 200% since its launch, driven by community interest and unique staking incentives. Hyperliquid offers high liquidity pools and innovative yield farming strategies that appeal to DeFi enthusiasts. Its growth is fueled by the rising demand for decentralized trading platforms, especially as more investors seek alternatives to traditional exchanges. Hyperliquid’s potential lies in its ability to provide users with better returns while keeping transaction costs low. Why this coin made it to this list – Hyperliquid’s rapid price movement and solid performance in the DeFi sector show strong potential for significant returns. 4. Sui (SUI) Leads with Scalable Blockchain Technology Sui is making waves as a high-speed, scalable Layer 1 blockchain designed for decentralized applications (dApps). Its recent developments focus on delivering faster transactions with lower fees, catering to developers building large-scale applications. The network’s speed and efficiency make it attractive to businesses looking for blockchain solutions that can handle heavy loads. Sui recently unlocked a batch of tokens, and market interest has pushed its value higher. As more projects build on the Sui network, the potential for growth looks promising, especially in the expanding dApp ecosystem. Why this coin made it to this list – Sui’s focus on scalability and efficiency aligns with investor interest in blockchain projects that offer practical solutions and long-term growth. 5. Fantom (FTM) Rises with Smart Contract Upgrades Fantom continues to hold attention as a high-performance smart contract platform. With the launch of its new Sonic upgrade, the platform has improved transaction speeds and reduced fees, making it a favorite for developers creating decentralized applications. Fantom’s emphasis on speed without compromising security gives it an edge over competing platforms. The latest mainnet upgrade has been well-received, suggesting Fantom could attract more users and developers in the coming months. Why this coin made it to this list – Fantom’s ongoing upgrades and focus on scalability make it an attractive pick for significant returns. 6. Monero (XMR) Strengthens Its Privacy Roots Monero has always been a frontrunner in privacy-centric cryptocurrencies. With concerns over financial surveillance growing, Monero’s focus on anonymous transactions continues to appeal to users wanting to protect their data. Analysts predict Monero’s price could breach the $300 mark, indicating strong investor interest. The ability to keep transactions private has cemented Monero’s place in the market. As governments tighten regulations, demand for privacy coins like Monero could rise even further. Why this coin made it to this list – Monero’s unwavering commitment to privacy makes it a solid bet for investors focusing on secure, anonymous transactions. 7. Qubetics Presale Keeps Building Momentum Qubetics’ presale has been breaking records, with the current price sitting at $0.0377. Analysts predict that $TICS could hit $0.25 by the end of the presale, resulting in a potential ROI of over 563%. With predictions of $TICS reaching $10 post-mainnet, early investors stand to gain returns of over 26,000%. An investment of $325,000 at the current stage could potentially be worth millions if these projections hold. With each stage lasting only seven days, there’s limited time to get in before the next price hike. Why this coin made it to this list – The ongoing Qubetics presale and strong future predictions give investors a unique opportunity to buy early into a project with immense growth potential. Final Thoughts on These Top Altcoins The crypto space is heating up with projects that are actually solving problems, and it’s hard to ignore what’s happening right now. Qubetics ($TICS) is making waves with its fast presale and cross-border transaction focus, while Toncoin is tapping into the growing need for decentralized communication. Fantom’s smart contract upgrades and Sui’s scalable tech are giving developers more reasons to jump in, and Monero keeps holding strong for those who care about privacy. Hyperliquid’s making moves in DeFi, proving there’s still room for new players. Each of these altcoins brings something fresh to the table, and they’re looking like solid bets for anyone chasing real returns.

38182179,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/ripple-price-will-reach-10-but-this-xrp-alternative-coin-at-0150-will-rise-higher-to-20,1735302515,"Ripple Price Will Reach $10, But this XRP Alternative Coin at $0.150 Will Rise Higher to $20","Crypto analysts have shared their unified view on Ripple’s XRP and Rexas Fiance's RXS. They have predicted that XRP will reach a high of $10 in 2025 and potentially reach multiple milestones within the year. However, they have predicted that a new cryptocurrency, Rexas Finance , will surpass it. Now valued at $0.150, Rexas Finance (RXS) will soar to $20 in 2025, yielding better returns than XRP. Analysts Place Ripple (XRP) 2025 Peak at $10 Given analysts' predictions of Ripple's XRP soaring above $10, it is attracting a lot of interest. There are several reasons behind this positive prediction, making $10 a reasonable goal. An End to the Ripple-SEC Battle A favorable outcome of Ripple's legal conflict with the SEC is another main determinant of its likely rise above $10. There has been speculation about a closed-door conference that might cause the case to be closed. Marc Fagel, a former SEC attorney, has lately raised even more hope by suggesting the likelihood of the SEC dropping its appeal. If it sees positive results, this will boost investors' confidence and institutional adoption. A Favorable Crypto Environment The upcoming inauguration of a pro-crypto U.S. administration is also expected to benefit XRP. The administration promises to create a more favorable regulatory environment, which could set the stage for broader adoption of cryptocurrencies, including XRP. Ripple’s contributions to the incoming administration’s campaign have strengthened its position and could catalyze further price growth. Technological Advancements Institutional developments on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) add to its bullish outlook. Ripple recently partnered with Archax and abrdn to tokenize a $3.8 billion money market fund. This shows XRPL’s capacity for handling real-world asset tokenization. The release of Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin is one immediate cause of optimism. The stablecoin is designed to enable easy cross-border payments. RLUSD is already gaining traction across platforms, which can push XRP to $10 soon. The Possible Approval of Ripple Exchange-traded Fund (ETF) Finally, XRP ETF has been on the lips of many, with several institutions filing for approval. This would be a significant catalyst for XRP if they gain the SEC's approval. Analysts who have considered these several factors have said that 2025 will be filled with milestones for Ripple, which will lead its token to rally exponentially, peaking at $10 in 2025. Rexas Finance (RXS) Aims Higher for $20 Meanwhile, Rexas Finance, a Ripple alternative now priced at $0.150, can reach $20 in 2025. The momentum of its token presale has already solidified this possibility. The Rexas Finance presale has reached stage ten in less than four months. RXS is now $0.150 at stage ten, a 400% increase from the initial $0.03. The token will eventually launch at $0.20, pushing the returns to 566%. Post-launch, analysts expect it to be one of the top gainers in 2025, raking in massive returns as it rallies to $20. Rexas Finance: Driven by a Strong Ambition Rexas Finance stunned the crypto community with its ambition for real-world assets. With the recent trend in decentralized finance, Rexas Finance has also secured a unique position with its goal of tokenizing real-world assets. This process not only creates digital versions of traditional assets but also solves significant problems in the market. The real-world asset (RWA) market has faced issues like illiquidity, high cost, and inaccessibility. However, decentralized finance offers a solution through tokenization, which Rexas Finance has embraced. The platform seeks to turn RWAs into digital tokens, providing liquidity, breaking the cost barrier, and providing global access. Now, a broader range of investors can join in, including small-scale investors who had previously been locked out because of the cost barrier. A Trail Blazer in Decentralized Finance Rexas Finance goes a step further with its collection of powerful tools. At the forefront is the Token Builder, which simplifies asset tokenization. It's an excellent product because it requires no coding knowledge or technical skill. Other features include the Rexas Estate, Rexas DeFi, Rexas QuickMint Bot, and Rexas GenAI. There's also the Rexas AI Shield, Rexas Treasury, and Rexas Launchpad. These standout tools showcase Rexas Finance's ability to innovate in the DeFi space. The project has completed a CertiK Audit, certifying it as a low-risk opportunity. It is also listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, boosting visibility and credibility. RXS's launch is barely a mile away, with an expected launch date in Q1 2025. The plans to launch on at least three major exchanges have further fueled optimism and confidence. Targeting Higher Returns in 2025 For investors looking for the best returns in 2025, Rexas Finance is definitely the way to go. With its potential to go 2X above XRP’s 2025 target, it could turn you into a mega-millionaire. The token’s launch is meant to be the catalyst for the rally, with other factors boosting the rise. RXS is just $0.150 right now, a cheap entry price that can deliver explosive returns. Now is indeed the perfect time to buy before its next price move.The platform is also running a giveaway that will give twenty lucky winners $50,000 worth of RXS each.

Judging by its charts, Ripple has surged in price throughout 2017, but more crucially, XRP began to experience tendencies for a price explosion sometime in the latter half of 2017. At the same point in time, Solana started to tear into shreds all the expectations, allowing their consumer base to grow beginning in 2021. However, with the advancement of new coins, which have practical benefits within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, they are steadily making their way out with great anticipation. Rexas Finance , Movement, Usual, and Horizen are some of the cryptocurrencies that a majority of people are eager to invest in. Rexas Finance (RXS): An Emerging Player in the Altcoin Market Rexas Finance (RXS) is one of the new emerging coins that seeks to enter the market with a bang and has been gaining traction in the world of cryptocurrency among investors looking for the next best thing. People have begun to associate Rexas Finance (RXS) with popular coins like Solana (SOL). Investors who thought that Rexas Finance (RXS) might increase in value in the future were drawn to the Stage 1 presale, which was offered at a price of $0.03. Currently, Rexas (RXS) is in Stage 10 of the presale at a cost of $0.15. A total supply of over 368 million tokens sold out of a target of 380 million raised over $31 million. The coin is projected to launch in 2025 with an opening at $0.20. Those who participated in the presale may benefit the most as the project expands due to the growing demand for Rexas Finance (RXS). Factors Contributing to RXS's Growth Potential Innovative Real-world Application: Rexas Finance's concentration on real-world asset tokenization contributes to an increasing need for blockchain inclusion in the traditional asset market, readying it for mass market inception. Strong Performance During Presale: The large amount of funds raised during the presale stages evidences a large sense of trust tapered down from investors, giving the project enough resources to implement its road map. Usual (USUAL): A Promising Force in the Crypto Space Usual is a decentralized issuer of Fiat Stablecoins that uses the $USUAL token to disperse ownership and control. USUAL is the governance token that powers Usual protocol and grants users ownership and control over the treasury and infrastructure. Usual (USUAL) is now trading at about $1.43, with over 464 million USUAL tokens in circulation out of a total supply of 479.82 million USUAL; the market capitalization is roughly $670.32 million. The maximum supply of USUAL is limited to 4 billion tokens; this is to produce scarcity, which might eventually increase the token's value. Movement (MOVE): Shaping the Future of Blockchain with Innovation MOVE, a native token of the Ethereum-based Movement Network, uses the Move programming language to provide quicker and more secure transactions. The current market value of MOVE is $0.8192, with 2.25 billion (22.5%) of the tokens in circulation out of a total quantity of 10 billion tokens and a market cap of $1.83 billion. The distribution of tokens is carefully planned to promote ecosystem expansion and encourage involvement. Analysts predict that by July 2025, Movement's price will have increased to almost $2. Experts predict that MOVE will increase to around $3.5 by December, irrespective of possible volatility during the year. Horizen (ZEN): Strengthening is Position as a Secure and Scalable Ecosystem Horizen is an inclusive environment where everyone is given power and valued for their contributions. A crucial component of the Horizen platform is the digital currency ZEN. Zen is a mineable cryptocurrency comparable to Bitcoin but with a different block reward distribution. Currently, ZEN is trading at approximately $24.76 per token. The circulating supply is around 15.76 million ZEN, leading to a market capitalization of about $390.2 million. According to analysts, 2025 may be a remarkable year for Horizen, with an upward trend that might push the currency to all-time highs. Conclusion In the constantly evolving cryptocurrency space, Rexas stands out as a shining example of creativity and promise. Strong tokenomics, a focus on scalability, and a dedication to decentralized governance make Rexas a serious candidate to match the rise of Solana in 2021 or Ripple in 2017.

XRP stood out, jumping 54.65% in a month to hit $2.31. This impressive rally brought its market cap to $132.3 billion, with an eye-catching 270% quarterly growth, solidifying its rank as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency. Although XRP is down 4% today, trading at $4.25, the market remains optimistic about its long-term prospects, with trading volumes reaching new peaks Spotlight on XRP ETFs XRP’s rising momentum has shifted focus to the prospect of XRP ETF approvals. iTrustCapital , a leading crypto IRA platform, has emphasized the potential impact of these products on XRP’s adoption. With Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs gaining approval earlier this year, attention has now turned to XRP, and several asset managers are lining up to launch their own XRP ETFs. Bitwise led the charge by filing its S-1 application with the SEC on October 2, 2024. Other players, including Canary Capital, 21Shares, and WisdomTree, quickly followed suit, with WisdomTree submitting its application as recently as December 2. Grayscale Investments and Bitwise are also exploring ETF baskets featuring XRP, signaling growing interest in tokenized investment products. Today we filed an S-1 for a Bitwise XRP ETP!

These products would allow investors to access XRP through traditional brokerage accounts while operating under-regulated financial markets, offering greater investor protection. Not only that XRP ETFs will be regulated assets with minimum risk involved. Potential Challenges Despite their benefits, ETFs are not without challenges. They operate within limited trading hours, involve indirect ownership of XRP, and are susceptible to tracking errors and high fees. These drawbacks may dissuade investors seeking more direct and cost-effective ways to hold XRP. Crypto Impact Approval of XRP ETFs could significantly impact the token’s demand and supply. Institutional investors would need to accumulate large amounts of XRP to back these funds, creating buying pressure and potentially driving up prices. Additionally, the introduction of XRP ETFs could increase market visibility and institutional adoption, establishing XRP as a bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world. This recognition may attract new waves of investment into the token. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For December 27 , When Could XRP ETFs Go Live? It is not clear when it will be officially launched, but speculation suggests XRP ETFs could hit in 2025 under a potentially crypto-friendly SEC leadership. With pro-crypto advocate Paul Atkins as SEC Chair , the market is bullish for an early approval once Trump takes charge. Like Bitcoin ETFs have given a good start to down crypto market this year, XRP ETFs are also expected to follow the lead, with Solana ETF also in the race it will be interesting to see who gets the first mover advantage next year after Bitcoin. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

38182418,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633878,1735302275,A new hack in town – Crypto users warned of phishing attacks disguised as Zoom meeting links,"SlowMist has brought attention to a new phishing scam targeting cryptocurrency users. The scam disguises itself as fake Zoom meetings to distribute malware that steals sensitive data. It involves counterfeit Zoom links that trick victims into downloading malicious files aimed at extracting cryptocurrency assets. According to blockchain security platform SlowMist, the attackers behind the scam used a sophisticated phishing technique involving a domain that mimicked the legitimate Zoom domain. The phishing website, “app[.]us4zoom[.]us,” looks very similar to the genuine Zoom website interface. ⚠️Beware of phishing attacks disguised as Zoom meeting links!🎣 Hackers collect user data and decrypt it to steal sensitive info like mnemonic phrases and private keys. These attacks often combine social engineering and trojan techniques. Read our full analysis⬇️… pic.twitter.com/kDExVZNUbv — SlowMist (@SlowMist_Team) December 27, 2024 Victims are prompted to click a “Launch Meeting” button, which they expect to take them to a Zoom session. However, instead of opening the Zoom application, the button initiates the download of a malicious file titled “ZoomApp_v.3.14.dmg.” Malware execution and data theft ploy uncovered Once downloaded, the malicious file triggers a script that requests the user’s system password. The script executes a hidden executable named “.ZoomApp,” which is designed to access and collect sensitive system information, including browser cookies, KeyChain data, and cryptocurrency wallet credentials. Per security experts, the malware is specifically tailored to target cryptocurrency users, with the intention of stealing private keys and other crucial wallet data. The downloaded package, once installed, will run a script called “ZoomApp.file.” Upon execution, the script prompts users to enter their system password, unknowingly giving hackers access to sensitive data. Crypto hacks through Zoom links – Source: SlowMist After decrypting the data, SlowMist revealed that the script ultimately executes an osascript , which transfers collected information to the attackers’ backend systems. SlowMist also traced the phishing site’s creation to 27 days ago, suspecting the involvement of Russian hackers. These hackers have been using Telegram’s API to monitor activity on the phishing site, tracking whether anyone clicked the download link. According to the security company’s analysis, the hackers began targeting victims as early as November 14. Stolen funds moved through several exchanges SlowMist used the on-chain tracking tool MistTrack to investigate the movements of stolen funds. The hacker’s address, identified as 0x9fd15727f43ebffd0af6fecf6e01a810348ee6ac, has reportedly profited more than $1 million in cryptocurrency, including USD0++, MORPHO, and ETH. In a detailed analysis, MistTrack revealed that the hacker address had exchanged USD0++ and MORPHO for 296 ETH. Stolen crypto movements tracked by MistTrack. Source: MistTrack Further investigation showed that the hacker’s address received small ETH transfers from another address, 0xb01caea8c6c47bbf4f4b4c5080ca642043359c2e, which appeared to be responsible for providing transaction fees for the hacker’s scheme. The address has been found to transfer small amounts of ETH to nearly 8,800 other addresses, suggesting it may be part of a larger platform dedicated to funding transaction fees for illicit activities. ETH transfers between addresses linked to the Zoom link scam – Source: SlowMist Once the stolen funds were gathered, they were funneled through various platforms. Binance, Gate.io, Bybit, and MEXC were among the exchanges that received the stolen cryptocurrency. The funds were then consolidated into a different address, with transactions flowing into several exchanges, including FixedFloat and Binance. There, the stolen funds were converted into Tether (USDT) and other cryptocurrencies. The criminals behind this scheme have managed to evade direct capture by using complex methods to launder and convert their illicit gains into widely-used cryptocurrencies. SlowMist warned crypto enthusiaststhat the phishing site and associated addresses may continue to target unsuspecting cryptocurrency users.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-cyborg-trumpcyb-solana-memecoin-to-explode-15000-before-exchange-listing-as-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
38182694,191593,1735302085,Bitget Unveils Over $5 Billion Worth of BGB Token Burn in New Whitepaper,"Victoria, Seychelles, December 27th, 2024, Chainwire Bitget , the leading cryptocurrency exchange and Web3 company, has released a new whitepaper for its native token, Bitget Token (BGB). The update introduces an unprecedented initiative to burn 800 million BGB tokens—valued at over $5 billion based on current market prices—alongside plans to expand the token's utility. This move shows Bitget’s commitment to enforcing a deflationary supply model for BGB, accelerating its utility. The new whitepaper introduces an ambitious token burn plan, starting with the immediate and permanent burn of 800 million BGB - 40% of the total supply - reducing the circulating supply to 1.2 billion. Beginning in 2025, Bitget will initiate quarterly burns by allocating 20% of profits from Bitget Exchange and Bitget Wallet, including revenues from spot, futures, and NFT transactions, to buy back and burn BGB. All burn activities will be recorded on-chain, ensuring transparency and accountability to the community. Bitget recently announced the merger of Bitget Token (BGB) and Bitget Wallet Token (BWB) . Following this merger, BGB will serve as the unified token for Bitget’s centralized and decentralized ecosystems. Currently, BGB offers various benefits to its holders, including fee discounts, VIP privileges, and access to token farming through Launchpool. Looking ahead, Bitget plans to expand BGB’s utility within on-chain ecosystems, positioning it as a core asset for staking, liquidity provision, and airdrop eligibility. Additionally, BGB will power Bitget Wallet services, such as multi-chain gas fee payments, while extending its use cases to everyday PayFi scenarios. In the competitive landscape of crypto exchanges, Bitget has distinguished itself as the fastest-growing centralized exchange (CEX) in recent years. This achievement is conquered by a team of 1,600 professionals across 60+ countries, a comprehensive ecosystem encompassing fiat, spot, margin, and futures trading, and cutting-edge technology ensuring a seamless trading experience. Bitget further strengthens user confidence with advanced security measures, including a $600M Protection Fund and a monthly updated Proof-of-Reserve report. Its proactive compliance strategy, and acquisition of licenses in multiple jurisdictions, strengthen its position as the world’s leading CEX. ""CEXs are the backbone of crypto's growth towards mass adoption. Bitget's mission of fuelling the next wave of innovation will unfold in the coming year, said Gracy Chen, CEO at Bitget . ""Our decision to burn $5 billion worth of BGB aligns with our plans of making it a powerful medium of transacting value. Our next phase will extend BGB's utility on-chain, integrating it into more Dapps and bringing it to the masses, making BGB available to all, making PayFi a part of everyday life,” she added. BGB has shown notable performance in 2024, with its market capitalization increasing by over 1000% in the past year and over 100-fold since its inception. This strong growth is backed by a proven track record of the token’s strong use cases and the success of Bitget’s innovative ecosystem. The release of the updated BGB whitepaper marks an important moment in Bitget’s journey. By reducing supply, enhancing utility, and expanding real-world applications, BGB is bound to strengthen more functionalities and products in the Bitget ecosystem driving sustainable growth and long-term value for holders.

38182347,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53243,1735302017,Top Analyst Predicts XRP Surge to $27 Based On This Historical Pattern,"EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto), a well-known cryptocurrency analyst, has presented a detailed analysis of XRP’s potential to reach $27 soon. Using historical data and technical indicators, the analysis compares XRP’s current price action to its explosive growth during the 2017 bull market, offering a compelling argument for significant upward movement. #XRP – @egragcrypto is Stubborn at $27 : Let’s break it down step by step with stats and insights: 1⃣ Measuring the Pump: When #XRP crossed the 21 EMA on the 2-week Time Frame, the move to the cycle top was nothing short of explosive (50,000%) 2⃣ Mirroring Today’s… pic.twitter.com/e4DTgUohS4 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 26, 2024 Key Historical Insight and the 50,000% Pump EGRAG CRYPTO’s analysis begins with a historical reflection on XRP’s performance during its 2017 bull run. When XRP crossed the 21-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) in the two-week timeframe, it experienced a meteoric rise of approximately 50,000% to its all-time high of $3.84. This exponential growth provides a key benchmark for gauging the current market dynamics. The analyst applies the historical measurement to XRP’s current price action. At the time of his analysis, the digital asset traded at $2.1881, and crossing the 21 EMA could potentially propel its price to $27. This projected increase represents a 4,770% surge, a significant figure but notably smaller compared to the 2017 rally. EGRAG CRYPTO also emphasized the importance of adjusting expectations by comparing the current setup to the historical pump. The projected 4,770% growth accounts for only 9.54% of the full potential realized in the 2017 cycle. This discounted perspective suggests a conservative approach to the analysis. However, he noted that this is just a fraction of the asset’s full potential. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Significance of the XRP $27 Target The $27 target stands out as a psychologically significant level and a potential resistance point. According to the analysis, reaching this level would align XRP with a measured and conservative growth trajectory, even as it falls short of the monumental growth seen in 2017. The analysis also highlights XRP’s consistent performance when crossing the 21 EMA, showing the importance of this technical indicator in predicting price movements. EGRAG CRYPTO has previously set a $27 target for the digital asset and has confidently said it is inevitable . His analysis presents a compelling case for XRP’s price appreciation. He compared historical performance to current conditions. The analysis offers a highly optimistic view despite its conservative targets. The possibility of a 4,770% increase to $27 is noteworthy, even when discounted against past performance, and investors will be eagerly watching to see if this prediction can materialize.

38182218,https://thecoinrise.com/bitwise-proposes-etf-to-invest-in-bitcoin-holding-corporations/,1735302015,Bitwise Proposes ETF to Invest in Bitcoin-Holding Corporations,"Bitwise has introduced an innovative approach to cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with its proposal for the Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF. Filed on December 26, the fund is designed to invest specifically in publicly traded companies that have committed to the “Bitcoin standard,” meaning those that hold at least 1,000 BTC in their corporate treasuries. Bitwise Focusing on Bitcoin Holdings Over Market Caps This ETF stands apart from traditional funds, which generally weight holdings based on a company’s market capitalization. Instead, Bitwise plans to allocate weight according to the market value of each company’s Bitcoin reserves, capping the maximum weight of any individual company’s Bitcoin holdings at 25%. This means that companies with larger Bitcoin hoards, like MicroStrategy, will have a greater influence on the ETF’s performance than firms with larger market caps but smaller Bitcoin holdings, such as Tesla. For instance, despite Tesla’s $1.42 trillion market cap, its 9,720 BTC holdings would place it at a lower weight in Bitwise’s ETF compared to MicroStrategy, which holds 444,262 BTC and has a market cap of $83.5 billion. This unique approach to weighting highlights Bitwise’s aim to capitalize on the increasing trend of companies using Bitcoin as part of their corporate strategy. With the cryptocurrency having gained 117% in 2024 alone, it’s clear that Bitcoin is becoming an attractive asset for institutional investors. A Surging Trend Among Public Companies The launch of the Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF comes at a time when several public companies have been making headlines for their Bitcoin purchases. On December 16, KULR Technology Group made a significant move, investing $21 million to purchase 217.18 BTC. This decision contributed to a remarkable 40% surge in KULR’s stock price , which hit an all-time high of $4.80. This shift towards Bitcoin as a corporate asset, aimed at boosting stock prices, is not only reshaping the financial landscape but also influencing the creation of new investment products. As Bitwise’s filing suggests, ETFs tied to companies that adopt Bitcoin reserve could become increasingly popular among investors seeking to capitalize on this trend. The filing also comes on the same day that Strive, a firm founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, proposed a separate ETF focused on “Bitcoin Bonds.” This fund would invest in convertible bonds issued by firms like MicroStrategy, showcasing the growing diversity in Bitcoin-related ETFs.

Ethereum rallies with $1.5b inflows into BlackRock’s ETF, sparking optimism for altcoins and a potential 2025 market surge. Table of Contents BlackRock spot Ethereum ETF hits record $1.5b inflows in 16 days. Ethereum set for a new year rally: Is $4,500 within reach? Can top altcoins follow Ethereum’s suit? Conclusion The market is down, but institutional inflow hasn’t fizzled one bit. This month, Ethereum is making a serious wave, as BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF has recorded a staggering $1.5b in inflow since November. The 16-day streak has revitalized market sentiment, with analysts looking forward to a major New Year’s rally for top altcoins. With technical indicators aligning and institutional adoption accelerating, could 2025 mark the start of a monumental turn for Ethereum and other altcoins? Let’s find out. BlackRock spot Ethereum ETF hits record $1.5b inflows in 16 days. The Ethereum market has entered a new era of optimism. BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF has set the pace for an extraordinary resurgence after recording a staggering 16-day streak culminating in a jaw-dropping $1.5 billion since November 20. This momentum builds on its $1.7b haul since launching in July, showcasing investor appetite for Ethereum. Ethereum’s post-election rally and the renewed interest in blockchain innovation have revitalized investor sentiment. Notably, Ethereum’s price surged past $4,000 following these record inflows. In fact, BlackRock’s U.S. head of thematic ETFs, Jay Jacobs, thinks the inflow is merely the “tip of the iceberg.” Ethereum set for a new year rally: Is $4,500 within reach? \With Ethereum’s price holding firm above $3,400, the market is buzzing with speculation of a New Year rally that could send ETH soaring by 30%. Over the weekend, Ethereum saw significant buying pressure as investors rotated from Bitcoin. This shift, paired with Ethereum staking inflows of 59k ETH and net outflows from exchanges of 130k ETH, signals bullish sentiment. Some analysts believe Ethereum could mirror its performance from early 2021, echoing previous market cycles. If the current trend persists, this top altcoin could challenge its yearly high of $4,093 and possibly breach its 2021 all-time high of $4,800. Can top altcoins follow Ethereum’s suit? The spotlight on Ethereum’s rally is reigniting interest in top altcoins. Projects like Remittix capture investors’ imagination with its huge potential and unique PayFi solution. Remittix is a crypto-to-fiat cross-border remittance network that bridges crypto with local payment networks globally. What sets Remittix apart is its versatility, it facilitates individual transactions and enables crypto enterprises to handle invoices, salaries, and merchant payments. This level of functionality marks a significant step forward in crypto adoption, particularly in emerging markets where traditional payment systems often face limitations. As Ethereum continues to advance with institutional support and use cases, it raises a critical question: Will projects like Remittix and other top altcoins ride the wave to new highs in 2025? Its ongoing presale is all the proof investors need. The presale accrued close to $500k in mere days, and price is still at just $0.0156. Conclusion Ethereum’s record-breaking inflows through BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF signal a powerful shift in market dynamics. As ETH pushes past key resistance levels, a new all-time high could be within reach. Meanwhile, top altcoins like Remittix are capturing attention with smart use cases and rapid presale momentum, hinting at a broader market resurgence. With 2025 on the horizon, the crypto landscape is primed for explosive growth, making now a pivotal moment for investors to watch closely.

The initiative unfolds in multiple coordinated stages, beginning with an immediate burn of 5.44 million AXGT tokens on December 20th at 3 PM EST, derived from accumulated liquidity pool fees. This initial action sets the stage for a more substantial strategic burn scheduled for February 13th, 2025, when 122 million AXGT tokens-representing 12.2% of the total supply will be permanently removed from the currently unallocated reserve of 490 million tokens. This larger burn deliberately mirrors the exact amount sold during the presale phase. At the heart of this phase lies the Metric Based Ignition Algorithm, a sophisticated system that introduces permanent deflationary mechanics to the ecosystem. The fully automated, contract-driven system will maintain a consistent 0.5% burn on all buy and sell transactions, operating continuously through a publicly accessible model. This autonomous system analyzes market data and ecosystem metrics in real-time, ensuring optimal token dynamics. ""This phase represents a significant advance in our token utility,"" said Christopher Crecelius, Founder of AxonDAO. ""Through the implementation of our Metric Based Ignition Algorithm and strategic burns, we're establishing a self-sustaining ecosystem that directly supports scientific advancement while maintaining robust tokenomics."" The strategic framework is further strengthened by a planned liquidity lock scheduled for January 2nd, 2025. This comprehensive approach, combining algorithmic burns, strategic supply reduction, and secured liquidity, creates a robust foundation for sustainable ecosystem growth. Central to this strategic initiative is the locking of AXGT-ETH liquidity pools, which establishes an automated funding mechanism for the DeSci Wallet. Through this approach, a portion of all trading fees are automatically channeled into scientific research funding, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem where market activity directly advances medical innovation. This represents the first implementation of its kind in the DeSci space, where traditional market dynamics are transformed into catalysts for scientific progress. ""Our transition to a data-driven, autonomous approach for token dynamics marks a new chapter for AxonDAO,"" states Maciej Stachowiak, Co-Founder and CTO of AxonDAO. ""The Metric Based Ignition Algorithm ensures that every transaction not only contributes to the ecosystem's strength but also advances our core mission of supporting groundbreaking scientific research."" AxonDAO's community continues to expand, now encompassing over 29,000 token holders alongside growing partnerships with leading healthcare institutions. The platform maintains its commitment to innovation, enabling secure, anonymous health data contribution while ensuring participants retain full sovereignty over their information.

Key Implications Investor Focus on Bitcoin Bitcoin dominance signals strong market confidence in BTC as the primary cryptocurrency. Many traders may be consolidating holdings into Bitcoin during periods of uncertainty or high volatility. Altcoin Underperformance Only a minority of altcoins have outpaced Bitcoin, reflecting weaker momentum in the altcoin market. Projects with strong fundamentals or unique use cases may still see gains but are exceptions rather than the rule. Shift in Liquidity Liquidity often flows into Bitcoin during Bitcoin Season, potentially causing reduced trading volumes and price stagnation in altcoins. Historical Context: Altcoin vs. Bitcoin Seasons Bitcoin and Altcoin Seasons are cyclical and depend on market sentiment, investor behavior, and macroeconomic factors. Bitcoin Season Characteristics Dominance of Bitcoin in market capitalization and trading volume. Stronger price stability compared to altcoins. Often coincides with early phases of bull markets or periods of consolidation. Altcoin Season Characteristics Altcoins consistently outperform Bitcoin. Market enthusiasm for smaller projects, often fueled by speculation. Typically occurs during later stages of bull markets or after Bitcoin’s price stabilizes. Period Altcoin Season Index Market Phase Q1 2021 85 (Altcoin Season) DeFi and NFT boom Q4 2022 15 (Bitcoin Season) Bitcoin recovery post-crash Q4 2024 (Current) 40 (Bitcoin Season) Bitcoin-led bull market Factors Influencing the Index 1. Bitcoin’s Dominance Bitcoin currently enjoys a dominant position in the market due to macroeconomic factors such as institutional interest and its perception as a safe-haven asset. 2. Market Liquidity During Bitcoin Season, liquidity tends to flow into BTC, reducing capital availability for altcoins. 3. Altcoin-Specific Events Individual altcoins with strong fundamentals or significant upgrades may still outperform Bitcoin, but these are outliers during Bitcoin Season. 4. Broader Market Trends Early stages of bull markets often favor Bitcoin. Later stages may see liquidity shift into altcoins, leading to Altcoin Season. What’s Next for the Crypto Market? The Altcoin Season Index at 40 suggests the market is not yet ready for a full-fledged Altcoin Season. However, certain scenarios could shift dynamics: Potential for Bitcoin Continuation If Bitcoin continues its bullish trend, its dominance could increase, prolonging Bitcoin Season. Signs of an Altcoin Rally A surge in Ethereum or other leading altcoins could catalyze a shift toward Altcoin Season. Significant announcements or technological breakthroughs in altcoins might attract investor attention. Macro Trends to Watch Regulatory developments and institutional adoption will play pivotal roles in shaping market sentiment. Market conditions, such as Bitcoin’s stability or corrections, may dictate liquidity flows into altcoins. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index’s drop to 40 highlights the cryptocurrency market’s current preference for Bitcoin over altcoins. As Bitcoin Season continues, traders and investors may focus on BTC as the leading asset in the space. However, the cyclical nature of the market suggests that Altcoin Season could return, especially if Bitcoin’s dominance plateaus or altcoins demonstrate compelling use cases. Monitoring key metrics like Bitcoin dominance, liquidity flows, and altcoin performance will be essential for navigating the market.

38181594,https://finbold.com/?p=223360,1735300970,Will Wall Street adopt the Bitcoin standard? The ‘BTC treasury operations virus is spreading’,"United States companies are one step closer to adopting what Bitcoin ( BTC ) enthusiasts call “the Bitcoin standard” for treasury operations. Analysts weighed in as a new Bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) waits approval, further spreading the BTC virus in Wall Street. On December 26, Bitwise filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch the “Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF.” As described, the ETF will invest in over-$100 million market cap companies holding at least 1,000 BTC in their corporate treasuries. With that, the asset manager intends to provide further indirect Bitcoin exposure to Wall Street’s stock market. At the same time, Bitwise’s proposed fund, if approved, could encourage more companies to follow MicroStrategy’s (NASDAQ: MSTR ) example. “The btc treasury operations virus is spreading,” Nate Geraci, president of ETF Store and host of ETF Prime Podcast, commented . SEC Filing: Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF. Companies eligible for the Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF Bitwise has filed for the “Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF,” targeting companies with significant Bitcoin holdings. MicroStrategy leads the pack with over 444,262 BTC in its treasury, setting a precedent for corporate adoption. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) is another company that holds substantial reserves, with 9,720 BTC. Notably, Semler Scientific (NASDAQ: SMLR ) has also embraced the Bitcoin standard for its treasury, holding 2,084 BTC. Publicly traded companies like KULR Technology Group have recently announced a $21 million investment in Bitcoin, joining the trend. However, it only holds 217.2 BTC and would not be eligible for the Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF. Rumble, LQR House, RemixPoint, Genius Group, Cosmos Health, and Jiva Technologies have announced plans to allocate portions of their treasuries to Bitcoin, ranging from $1 million to $20 million. According to BitcoinTreasuries data , there are 21 companies in the world and 13 in the U.S. that would be eligible for Bitwise’s new ETF as of December 27, 2024. Companies holding at least 1,000 BTC. Source: BitcoinTreasuries.net These moves come as Bitcoin’s market value continues to rise, with the cryptocurrency hitting an all-time high of over $108,000 in December 2024. This ETF, if approved, would invest in companies holding at least 1,000 BTC, worth around $100 million. Bitwise’s initiative aims to provide investors with exposure to firms adopting Bitcoin, potentially reshaping corporate finance strategies. Moreover, the ETF’s weighting based on Bitcoin holdings could highlight smaller firms with large crypto reserves, increasing the growth potential. This development marks a pivotal moment for BTC’s integration into mainstream corporate finance, opening doors for a potential Bitcoin standard.

38181714,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633882,1735300967,Whales accumulate AI16Z as focus shifts to top AI agent tokens,"The persistence of whale interest in AI16Z is a signal of a developing trend in AI tokens. AI16Z and its ELIZA ecosystem token remain one of the staples in the newly created AI agent space. A whale address has been accumulating AI16Z in the past few days, with the first substantial purchase starting on December 26. Whale buying once again signals accumulation for AI16Z, one of the top AI agent tokens. AI agents knocked off meme tokens The new storage wallet mainly holds AI16Z and ZEREBRO, another trending AI agent. Nansen tags the address itself as a “Zerebro Whale.” The other notable wallet, tagged “Michi Whale,” rolled over from POPCAT into AI16Z and MICHI. The two whale wallets also contain minor holdings from previous meme cycles, especially animal and viral memes on Solana. Meme tokens remain one of the strongest narratives at the end of 2024. However, the sector as a whole went through a drawdown, with its total valuation sliding under $100B. Despite this, both whales and retail are on the lookout for the next hot category of memes. It is precisely AI agents that started to deliver returns in the past day, rising from a valuation of around $8.7B to over $9.64B. The growth of AI agent tokens is driven by outliers, staging unexpected rallies. Whales make use of the short-term price fluctuations, while also betting on having sufficient liquidity to be able to realize profits. Truth Terminal still holds cult status, while boosting the FARTCOIN rally. AI16Z sparks competition between AI agent platforms Social media users quickly got bored of AI agents as a single personality. However, the agent market is spawning a new series of projects, aiming to provide utility and long-term sustainability. Toward the end of 2024, several platforms for launching new AI agents and tokens have appeared. Those platforms model their activity after Pump.fun, though with a more complex process of creating agents and deploying them on social media. While agents themselves compete for mindshare, platform tokens are singled out for their potential to reflect the growth of the entire AI agent space. AI16Z and its Eliza agent launchpad helped the token appreciate by 58% in the past week and draw the attention of buyers. AI16Z traded at $0.88, near its all-time high. While ELIZA was announced early and tried to market its launchpad brand, Virtuals Protocol locked in the biggest share of value in December. The token is second only to Virtuals Protocol, the leading AI agent launchpad on Base. VIRTUAL also traded close to its record price at $3.13. The two leading tokens made up around 30% of the entire market cap of AI agent assets. For now, the market does not reflect the newly rising agents, which are yet building up their social media presence. The biggest earner this time was Phala Network (PHA), expanding by 192% in the past week, close to its yearly high of $0.33. Phala Network reinvented itself after launching its 2.0 version on December 25. The platform does not explicitly deal with launching AI agents but with infrastructure for AI computation. Phala Network’s infrastructure is used for trusted AI token launches, making it indispensable in the new on-chain experiment. PHA also rose after the success of Spore.fun, a platform where AI agents compete and evolve independently. The Phala Network technology is also applied among projects from the Eliza framework by AI16Z. The recent token rallies show the AI agent space is increasingly connected, bringing both mindshare on social media and liquidity for new projects. The sector is also trying to build up liquidity and set up value transfers between agents. The AI narrative displaced the older types of AI tokens, which focused on nodes and consensus and often failed to deliver a usable product. The recent rise in AI agent platforms displaced previous narratives, such as shared GPU infrastructure for rendering and other tasks. The current drive is for infrastructure to tap the activity and value of AI personalities while adding meme tokens and DeFi elements.

38181515,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=115061,1735300918,U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs Attract $117.2M in Net Inflows on December 26,"U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs Attract $117.2M in Net Inflows on December 26 The growing demand for Ethereum-based financial products has taken another leap, with U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs reporting a combined net inflow of $117.2 million on December 26. This marks the third consecutive day of positive inflows, underscoring rising investor confidence in Ethereum’s potential as a mainstream asset. According to data from Farside Investors , leading ETFs such as BlackRock’s ETHA , Fidelity’s FETH , and Grayscale’s ETH were among the top performers, driving the majority of the inflows. Spotlight on Leading Ethereum ETFs 1. Fidelity’s FETH Dominates with $83 Million Fidelity’s FETH ETF led the day with an impressive $83 million in inflows. The strong performance reflects Fidelity’s reputation as a trusted name in asset management and its ability to attract institutional and retail investors alike. 2. BlackRock’s ETHA Gains $28.2 Million BlackRock, a dominant player in the ETF market, saw $28.2 million in inflows to its ETHA fund. The company’s influence and extensive client base contribute significantly to the growing acceptance of Ethereum-based ETFs. 3. Grayscale’s ETH Adds $6 Million Grayscale, known for pioneering crypto investment vehicles, reported $6 million in inflows to its Ethereum spot ETF. Though smaller than its competitors, Grayscale’s inflows indicate sustained interest in Ethereum among long-term investors. Understanding Spot Ethereum ETFs Spot Ethereum ETFs allow investors to gain direct exposure to the price of Ethereum without holding the underlying asset. These ETFs are traded on traditional stock exchanges, offering a familiar entry point for institutional and retail investors. Key Benefits Regulated Framework : Operate within U.S. securities regulations, ensuring transparency and security. Ease of Access : Enable investors to participate in Ethereum’s growth without managing wallets or private keys. Mainstream Adoption : Signal broader acceptance of Ethereum in traditional financial markets. Why the Inflows Are Significant The inflows into U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs highlight several important trends in the crypto and financial markets: 1. Institutional Adoption Large inflows, particularly into Fidelity and BlackRock ETFs, signal strong institutional interest in Ethereum as a credible investment. Ethereum’s utility in decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts makes it a compelling choice for long-term portfolios. 2. Broader Market Confidence Positive inflows during a traditionally quiet holiday season suggest growing confidence in Ethereum’s market stability and potential. 3. Regulatory Milestone The success of these ETFs indicates that U.S. regulators are increasingly comfortable with spot crypto products, potentially paving the way for more innovation in the sector. Comparison with Bitcoin ETFs Ethereum ETFs are following the path set by Bitcoin spot ETFs, which have seen strong demand since their approval. However, Ethereum’s unique capabilities, such as its role in DeFi and NFTs, set it apart from Bitcoin. Metric Spot Bitcoin ETFs Spot Ethereum ETFs Adoption Timeline Established earlier Recently launched Utility Digital gold narrative DeFi and smart contracts Recent Inflows Steady Accelerating rapidly What’s Driving the Demand? 1. Ethereum’s Growing Use Cases Ethereum’s applications in DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise solutions continue to expand, enhancing its value proposition for investors. 2. Attractive Market Conditions As Ethereum’s price stabilizes following 2024’s market volatility, investors are seizing opportunities to accumulate exposure through regulated products. 3. Diversification Strategy For institutions and individuals, Ethereum ETFs offer a way to diversify portfolios without the complexities of directly managing crypto assets. Potential Impacts of Ethereum ETF Inflows Increased Price Stability Large, consistent inflows into spot ETFs can reduce market volatility by creating sustained demand. Boosted Liquidity ETFs channel significant capital into the Ethereum ecosystem, enhancing market depth and liquidity. Market Validation The success of these products validates Ethereum as a mainstream financial asset, encouraging broader adoption. Conclusion The $117.2 million in net inflows to U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on December 26 underscores Ethereum’s growing appeal among institutional and retail investors. With Fidelity, BlackRock, and Grayscale leading the charge, Ethereum is cementing its position as a cornerstone asset in the cryptocurrency market. As the market continues to evolve, the success of spot Ethereum ETFs signals a promising future for the integration of crypto assets into traditional finance. For investors, these ETFs represent an accessible and regulated way to participate in Ethereum’s growth, further solidifying its role in the global financial landscape.

Bitcoin ($BTC) continues to outperform. However, have Ethereum ($ETH) and Solana ($SOL) now hit bottom against their $BTC pairs? Bitcoin Dominance breakdown confirmation Source: TradingView The chart to watch for the first signs of any big altcoin movement is Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D). An ascending wedge that has been forming since June 2022 looks to finally be breaking down. Domination broke below the end of the wedge and it looks like the break may be confirmed. Traders and investors could then look for a lower low to take dominance below 54.6%, with an eventual target of 48% down to 40%. $ETH at huge support against its $BTC pair Source: TradingView $ETH is at a very critical point against its $BTC pair (ETH/BTC). A long-time descending channel has taken $ETH to a hugely important horizontal support level at 0.036 BTC. If this support were to fail, and also the coincidence of the ascending bull market trendline, it would likely be game-over for $ETH - at least until the start of the next bull market. A bounce must happen from this current level, and given the weight of the support, this really should happen. That said, the Stochastic RSI momentum indicator at the bottom of the chart has just recorded a turn down of the indicator line. This line is very likely to continue down, with a last chance to bounce at the 50.00 level. This last chance must be taken. $SOL ready for massive bounce against $BTC Source: TradingView Compared to ETH/BTC, the SOL/BTC chart is incredibly bullish. What initially looked like a bull pennant, broke down in early December after being rejected from its upper trendline. The price carried on down and came to rest on top of the massively important horizontal support level of 0.00186 BTC. It now appears that this could also be the bottom of a bull flag, and if this is the case, a breakdown wouldn’t have occurred. The concurrence of the bull flag trendline and the horizontal price level are acting as massive support. It would be expected that $SOL continues to bounce from here, with a climb back to the top of the bull flag and a potential breakout from there back to all-time highs. A further factor in favour of $SOL is the Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart. The indicator lines have hit the bottom and are just starting to turn upward. The momentum for $SOL over $BTC is likely to rise steeply. Watch this pair closely. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

38181476,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=115063,1735300833,Santiment: Whale Stablecoin Deposits Signal Potential Crypto Buying Opportunity,"Santiment: Whale Stablecoin Deposits Signal Potential Crypto Buying Opportunity On-chain analytics platform Santiment has identified a significant increase in stablecoin deposits from whale addresses into cryptocurrency exchanges, signaling potential accumulation. Following a post-Christmas market dip, the uptick in large deposits suggests that whales are preparing to buy crypto assets, which could lead to a market-wide price increase. Notably, seven Binance deposits involving the FDUSD stablecoin —each valued at over $9 million —were recorded in the past 24 hours, including a massive $50 million transfer . Whale Behavior: A Key Market Indicator Whale activity is a critical factor in understanding cryptocurrency market trends. These large investors, with significant holdings, have the ability to influence price movements through their trading strategies. Why Whale Stablecoin Deposits Matter Market Timing : Stablecoin deposits often precede major buying activity, as whales transfer funds to exchanges in preparation for acquisitions. Liquidity and Volume : Large stablecoin inflows boost liquidity, paving the way for substantial purchases without causing excessive price volatility. Sentiment Shift : Increased whale activity is frequently associated with renewed optimism, signaling potential market recovery or growth. FDUSD and Its Role in Whale Transactions FDUSD, a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, has become a popular choice for large transactions due to its stability and wide acceptance on exchanges like Binance. $50 Million Deposit : The single largest FDUSD transaction highlights the scale of whale involvement, reflecting substantial buying power. Frequent Deposits : Multiple transfers suggest sustained activity rather than isolated events, indicating strategic accumulation. What Does This Mean for the Market? 1. Accumulation Phase Whale stablecoin deposits are often a precursor to accumulation phases, where large investors increase their holdings of Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other altcoins. Market Impact : As whales buy, their activity can drive prices higher, attracting additional investors and creating positive momentum. Altcoin Opportunity : While Bitcoin and Ethereum are likely targets, smaller-cap altcoins may also benefit from increased liquidity and broader market optimism. 2. Buying Signal Santiment’s analysis positions the current wave of whale deposits as a strong buying signal , particularly for traders seeking to align with market trends. Short-Term Gains : Inflows suggest potential upward price action in the near term. Long-Term Strategy : Accumulation by whales could signal confidence in the market’s long-term prospects. Historical Context: Whale Deposits as Market Catalysts Whale activity has historically acted as a reliable indicator of market trends: Period Whale Activity Market Outcome Q1 2021 Large stablecoin deposits Triggered a bull market for Bitcoin Q3 2022 Withdrawal of funds from exchanges Preceded a prolonged market correction Q4 2024 Current stablecoin deposits Signals accumulation and potential rally These patterns underscore the influence of whales on market direction, particularly during periods of uncertainty or transition. Cautions and Considerations While whale activity provides valuable insights, it’s important to approach such signals with a degree of caution: Volatility Risks : Sudden buying or selling by whales can amplify market volatility. Market Conditions : Broader economic factors, such as interest rates or regulatory changes, may still impact overall trends. Diversification : While whale signals can be bullish, investors should maintain a diversified portfolio to mitigate risks. Conclusion The recent surge in stablecoin deposits by whale addresses , as reported by Santiment, highlights a potential buying opportunity in the cryptocurrency market. With significant FDUSD transactions indicating strategic preparation for accumulation, prices across the market could see upward momentum in the coming days. For traders and investors, aligning strategies with whale activity could offer a chance to capitalize on this trend. However, staying informed and balancing risk is essential to navigate the volatile nature of crypto markets.

Analyst Javon Marks recently projected that DOGE will attain a target of $2.28 by year-end. This positive perspective is founded on a synthesis of market sentiment and technical analysis. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Breaks Out Of Symmetrical Triangle Pattern, Analyst Puts Target Above $0.37 Short-Term Bullish Momentum The technical side shows good bullish momentum in the short and medium term for Dogecoin. There’s likely to be an approximate rise of 206% over the next three months with the current sentiment of the market. This is indicative of increased interest in DOGE because it continues to position itself as a potential investment vehicle. In the next six months, a more tempered but still significant growth of 51% is expected, according to CoinCheckup. That means that the upward trend in Dogecoin can persist at a healthy rate. Bull Market Patterns The Fibonacci expansion analysis shows Dogecoin’s bull market patterns, which fuels Javon Marks’ forecast. DOGE rose from $0.00009 to $0.00748, matching the 1.618 Fibonacci level in 2015–2017. The 2020–2021 cycle saw it rise from $0.00168 to $0.73, surpassing the 1.618 Fibonacci level at $0.03912. $DOGE (Dogecoin) Update: The history hasn’t changed and still points to a fairly high likeliness of a price run to AND ABOVE the 1.618 Fib Extension level as it did every cycle prior to this and this time around, that’d result in a more than 570% increase from here to $2.28+! https://t.co/BtYB3vaWHH pic.twitter.com/Fdvqb7FtCW — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) December 25, 2024 Even though the price has dropped about 46% since its high point of $0.48, people are still generally hopeful. A lot of people think that DOGE could easily break through barrier levels and go to higher levels if the market as a whole is in a good mood. At the time of writing, the price of DOGE is around $0.3227. If Marks’ prediction holds true, then DOGE would have risen by 606% by the end of 2024. Dogecoin (DOGE) prices have gone up and down a lot in the past. In 2017, the coin started a parabolic rise that saw it rise by 200% and then drop by 40%. After that, it went up by an insane 5,000%. DOGE went through a similar trend in 2021. It went up 476%, then down 56%, and then up to 120%. Medium To Long-Term Predictions Looking forward to the one-year mark, the projections are still quite conservative at 24%, which will probably indicate stabilization after the initial growth. Although the short-term prospects for Dogecoin are extremely bullish, medium- and long-term gains might moderate with the change of market conditions. Related Reading: Moo Deng Crypto Climbs 70% On News Of Buterin’s Baby Hippo Adoption Other analysts are even predicting Dogecoin to reach $1 or $4 in the next few years, besides Marks’ predictions. In short, the convergence of political development, technical factors, and social sentiment has created a unique environment for growth. With DOGE gaining more ground as a payment method for many businesses, its utility in the cryptocurrency ecosystem will also grow.

Some have predicted that Ripple (XRP) could be the best investment, as they predict a 700% rise over the next few months. Others are looking beyond the top coins, with Fantom and the new MemeFi altcoin Yeti Ouro (YETIO) among the standouts. XRP Price To Surge 700% XRP has been on a stellar run since late November and has been the highest gainer among the top 10 coins in the market, nearly quadrupling its value over the past four months. Analysts expect the token to break out after a three-week consolidation in December, with the short-term target of XRP price being set at $3.5. After this, the token will embark on a run that experts believe will yield over 700% in returns. (Image courtesy of Bark Meta ). Investors are also eyeing Fantom after the recent launch of the Sonic mainnet, an EVM-compatible high-throughput layer 1 blockchain network that promises to change the game. Sonic promises over 10,000 transactions per second, with finality achieved in less than a second. While FTM has shed nearly 30% in the past week, Sonic’s launch could revitalize the token ahead of the New Year. Analysts note that it must break above $1.1 in the short term to surge over the first few weeks of 2025. Investors Rush To Yeti Ouro Meme Contest Meanwhile, Yeti Ouro has become one of the most talked-about crypto projects in recent days, following the success of its presale and a new meme contest that’s generating buzz on social media platforms. Meanwhile, the Yeti Ouro meme contest has wrapped up, with some of the participants sharing their innovative creations – https://x.com/nayansingh08/status/1871866750641532951?s=10 The project is in the second stage of its presale, where investors have already purchased over 10 million tokens, raising $179,000. In the previous stage, the project sold out all its allocated tokens and raised $1.2 million in a few weeks. Yeti Ouro sets itself apart from most projects by focusing on utility rather than hype, speculation and quick gains. The project, deployed on Ethereum, is built around Yeti Go, a thrilling play-to-earn game in which players are rewarded with YETIO tokens for winning their races. Yeti Go was developed by avid gamers in partnership with the studios behind Call of Duty, The Witcher 3, Spider-Man and other iconic global successes. It is built with Epic Games’ Unreal Engine, which makes it engaging and immersive. To win, players must dodge hazards, obstacles and attacks from other players.

38181401,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=115067,1735300683,"Crypto May Face Less Favorable Macro Conditions in 2025, Citi Warns","Crypto May Face Less Favorable Macro Conditions in 2025, Citi Warns Cryptocurrencies may encounter a challenging macroeconomic environment in 2025, according to a new report from Citigroup . Analysts have outlined six critical factors that could determine the success or failure of the digital asset market, emphasizing the importance of macroeconomic stability, ETF inflows, and regulatory developments . While the first quarter of 2025 is expected to support cryptocurrencies as risk assets, Citi warns of growing uncertainty due to potential policy shifts and increased market volatility later in the year. Six Key Factors for Crypto’s Success in 2025 Citi analysts identified the following factors as pivotal for the cryptocurrency market in 2025: 1. Supportive Macro Backdrop A favorable macroeconomic environment—marked by stable interest rates and inflation—could encourage risk-taking and drive capital into cryptocurrencies. However, Citi warns that U.S. policy shifts and global market volatility might disrupt this stability beyond Q1 2025. 2. Inflows into Spot ETFs Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have been significant market drivers in 2024, and continued inflows will be crucial for maintaining liquidity and investor interest. Citi analysts predict that crypto ETFs will remain a dominant force, especially as institutional adoption grows. 3. Integration into Multi-Asset Portfolios For institutions to increase their cryptocurrency allocations, crypto returns must consistently outperform equities and offer diversification benefits. Broader portfolio integration could enhance crypto’s appeal to traditional investors. 4. Stablecoin Issuance Stablecoins are expected to play a pivotal role in the DeFi ecosystem , offering liquidity and stability in an otherwise volatile market. Growth in stablecoin issuance may signal greater adoption of blockchain-based financial systems. 5. Regulatory Developments Regulatory clarity remains critical for institutional adoption. Citi highlights the need for balanced policies that promote innovation while addressing risks like fraud and market manipulation. 6. Economic Uncertainty Uncertainty tied to stock market volatility and global economic conditions could push investors toward or away from cryptocurrencies, depending on the perceived risks and opportunities. Macroeconomic Outlook for 2025 Short-Term Optimism Citi analysts suggest that Q1 2025 may be favorable for cryptocurrencies, with a stable macro backdrop supporting risk assets. Key factors include: Moderation in interest rate hikes by central banks. Improved investor sentiment amid economic stabilization. Long-Term Concerns Beyond Q1, Citi warns of potential headwinds: U.S. Policy Shifts : Changes in fiscal or monetary policy could disrupt market stability. Market Volatility : Increased turbulence in equity and bond markets may spill over into crypto. Spot ETFs and Institutional Adoption Spot cryptocurrency ETFs, particularly in the U.S., have emerged as a game-changing development, attracting billions in inflows. ETF Inflows as a Growth Driver Continued capital inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs are expected to bolster market liquidity and confidence. These products provide regulated exposure to crypto assets, making them accessible to a broader range of investors. Institutional Adoption Challenges For institutions to deepen their crypto investments, the asset class must consistently deliver higher risk-adjusted returns than traditional equities. Citi emphasizes the importance of integrating crypto into multi-asset portfolios to enhance diversification and returns. Stablecoins and DeFi: A Bright Spot Stablecoins remain a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, particularly in DeFi applications : Role in the Market Provide liquidity and act as a bridge between traditional and digital finance. Enable seamless transactions and minimize volatility risk for DeFi participants. Growth Potential Citi analysts expect stablecoins to continue leading DeFi innovation, with increased issuance signaling adoption in emerging markets and cross-border payments. Challenges Ahead Despite positive trends, Citi’s report underscores several challenges that could hinder crypto’s growth in 2025: 1. Regulatory Headwinds Stricter regulations or uncertainty could slow adoption, particularly among institutions. Balancing innovation with consumer protection remains a delicate task for policymakers. 2. Competition with Equities Cryptocurrencies must outperform traditional assets to attract institutional interest, particularly during periods of economic stability. 3. Market Volatility While volatility attracts traders, it deters long-term investors seeking stability and predictable returns. Conclusion Citigroup’s analysis highlights a mixed outlook for cryptocurrencies in 2025. While the first quarter may present favorable conditions for growth, uncertainty looms in the latter part of the year, driven by potential policy shifts, market volatility, and regulatory challenges . Nevertheless, spot ETFs, stablecoins, and DeFi remain promising areas of development, offering opportunities for adoption and innovation. As crypto continues to evolve, its ability to navigate macroeconomic and regulatory challenges will determine its long-term success.

38181364,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=115069,1735300611,PeckShield Issues Scam Alert for SquidGame Token on Base Network,"PeckShield Issues Scam Alert for SquidGame Token on Base Network Blockchain security firm PeckShield has issued a scam alert for a fraudulent SquidGame token deployed on Coinbase’s layer-2 network Base . The token, launched just three hours ago, has already lost 99% of its value, with the deployer retaining the largest share. PeckShield’s warning serves as a crucial reminder for investors to exercise caution when dealing with newly launched tokens, particularly those lacking transparency. What Is the SquidGame Token Scam? The SquidGame token scam mirrors tactics used in previous fraudulent schemes, where deceptive marketing and a familiar theme lure unsuspecting investors. Key Details Identified by PeckShield Deployed on Base Network The token was launched on Coinbase’s layer-2 network, Base , a popular platform known for low fees and scalability. The use of Base may have lent an air of legitimacy to the project, deceiving investors. Deployer Holds the Majority The token’s deployer retains the largest share, enabling them to manipulate the market. Such practices often lead to rug pull scenarios , where the deployer dumps their holdings, crashing the token’s value. 99% Value Drop Within hours of launch, the token’s value plummeted by 99% , leaving investors with significant losses. How Scammers Exploit New Investors Scammers often capitalize on popular themes or trends to create tokens that appear legitimate but are designed to defraud investors. Tactics Used in the SquidGame Token Scam Name Recognition : Leveraging the popularity of “Squid Game,” a widely recognized franchise, to attract attention. Fake Hype : Generating artificial excitement through social media and online forums. Low Transparency : Deploying tokens with unclear ownership, governance, or utility. Protecting Yourself from Token Scams To avoid falling victim to scams like the SquidGame token, investors should adopt the following practices: 1. Research Before Investing Verify the project’s website, team, and whitepaper. Look for audits or reviews from reputable blockchain security firms like PeckShield. 2. Check Ownership Distribution Avoid tokens where a single entity holds a disproportionate share. Use blockchain explorers to analyze wallet distributions. 3. Monitor Community Feedback Engage with the project’s community to gauge sentiment and transparency. Be wary of overly positive or scripted reviews. 4. Beware of Unrealistic Promises Avoid projects offering guaranteed returns or making bold, unsupported claims. Why Base Network Is a Target The Base network , built by Coinbase, has gained popularity for its low fees and developer-friendly environment. However, its rise has also made it a target for malicious actors: Low Deployment Costs : Scammers can deploy tokens at minimal expense, increasing the frequency of fraudulent schemes. Growing User Base : The network’s popularity attracts both legitimate projects and opportunistic scammers. While Base offers robust infrastructure, users must remain vigilant and rely on trusted security measures. Previous Scam Trends and Lessons Learned The SquidGame token scam is not the first instance of fraudulent tokens exploiting popular culture. Scam Token Key Tactic Outcome Squid Game Token (2021) Capitalized on Netflix series fame Rug pull after price surge Elder Scrolls Token Used gaming franchise branding Immediate value crash Meta Coin Mimicked Facebook rebranding Regulatory crackdown These examples highlight the recurring patterns of crypto scams and the need for investor awareness. What’s Next for the SquidGame Token? PeckShield’s timely alert has likely mitigated further losses for potential investors. However, the incident raises broader concerns: Increased Scrutiny : Platforms like Base and Coinbase may face pressure to enhance monitoring for fraudulent token launches. Community Education : Greater emphasis on educating investors about identifying and avoiding scams is essential. Regulatory Attention : Authorities may accelerate efforts to regulate token launches and enforce stricter standards. Conclusion The SquidGame token scam on Base underscores the persistent risks in the cryptocurrency market. PeckShield’s alert highlights the importance of vigilance and due diligence in protecting oneself from fraudulent schemes. As the crypto ecosystem evolves, both investors and platforms must prioritize security and transparency to foster trust and prevent similar incidents.

38181363,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=115073,1735300529,Crypto Analyst Suggests Bitcoin Could Retest $100K: Key Indicators Point to Bullish Momentum,"Crypto Analyst Suggests Bitcoin Could Retest $100K: Key Indicators Point to Bullish Momentum Bitcoin (BTC) may be gearing up for a retest of the $100,000 psychological resistance level by the end of 2024, according to an analysis shared by Cointelegraph . Citing insights from CryptoQuant contributor Burrakesmeci , the analysis points to rising Taker Buy Volume on Binance as a key indicator of growing demand and potential upward momentum. What Is Taker Buy Volume? Taker Buy Volume measures the total value of buy transactions executed by market takers—traders who place market orders that match existing limit orders on the exchange. Why It Matters Trend Indicator : Higher Taker Buy Volume suggests increased demand for Bitcoin, often signaling bullish sentiment. Market Confidence : Consistently rising buy volume indicates that investors are willing to pay the market price, a strong signal of confidence. Rising Taker Buy Volume on Binance Higher Lows Signal Upward Momentum Since October 28 , Taker Buy Volume on Binance has been establishing higher lows, reflecting sustained buying interest. Key milestones include: December 1 : Volume dipped below $5 billion . December 15 : Hovered just under $6 billion . December 25 : Surpassed $6 billion , reinforcing the upward trend. What Three Higher Lows Mean Technical analysts often interpret three consecutive higher lows as a sign of an emerging bullish trend. This pattern aligns with the broader market anticipation of Bitcoin revisiting the $100,000 mark. Bitcoin’s Path to $100K: Factors at Play 1. Market Sentiment and Psychological Resistance $100,000 is a significant psychological barrier, often acting as a magnet for traders aiming to capitalize on major price milestones. Positive sentiment driven by institutional adoption and increased ETF inflows could push BTC closer to this level. 2. Binance Data as a Bellwether As one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, Binance’s trading metrics, such as Taker Buy Volume, offer a reliable snapshot of market trends. Rising buy activity indicates robust demand, suggesting that investors expect further price appreciation. 3. Macro and Fundamental Drivers Spot Bitcoin ETFs : Continued inflows into ETFs have brought fresh capital to the market. Halving Event : The upcoming Bitcoin halving in 2024 is expected to reduce supply, historically a bullish catalyst. Institutional Interest : Companies and funds increasingly view Bitcoin as a hedge against macroeconomic instability. Potential Risks and Corrections While the rising Taker Buy Volume points to bullish potential, Burrakesmeci warns that the market may be overheated: 1. Short-Term Corrections Bitcoin’s volatile nature often results in sharp pullbacks, even during bullish trends. Corrections are common near key resistance levels like $100,000, as traders take profits. 2. Macro Uncertainty Global economic conditions, including interest rate decisions and regulatory changes, could impact Bitcoin’s trajectory. 3. Overleveraged Positions Excessive leverage in the market may lead to liquidations, amplifying downward pressure during corrections. Historical Context: Bitcoin’s Previous Milestones Bitcoin has approached key psychological levels in past bull cycles, often requiring multiple attempts to break through resistance: Cycle Year Key Resistance Level Outcome 2017 $20,000 Reached milestone but corrected sharply. 2021 $64,000 Surpassed resistance but faced volatility. 2024 $100,000 (predicted) Pending test of psychological barrier. Analyst’s Outlook for 2024 Burrakesmeci remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s potential to retest $100,000, citing the following indicators: Sustained Buy Demand : Rising Taker Buy Volume is a strong bullish signal. Market Resilience : Despite corrections, Bitcoin has shown the ability to recover and build momentum. However, the analyst emphasizes the importance of closely monitoring trading activity and macroeconomic trends as the year progresses. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rising Taker Buy Volume on Binance suggests a potential retest of the $100,000 level by the end of 2024, marking a major milestone in its adoption and market performance. While short-term corrections and macro uncertainties could pose challenges, the overall trend remains positive, supported by growing institutional interest and strong demand signals. For investors, aligning with these market indicators and maintaining a balanced strategy could provide opportunities to capitalize on Bitcoin’s next major price move.

38181289,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=115075,1735300476,Ethiopia Earns $1 Billion from Bitcoin Mining with Hydropower in 2024,"Ethiopia Earns $1 Billion from Bitcoin Mining with Hydropower in 2024 Ethiopia has emerged as a surprising player in the cryptocurrency space, earning $1 billion in Bitcoin mining revenue in 2024. This achievement was made possible by harnessing excess electricity generated by the Grand Renaissance Dam , a massive hydropower project. According to Bitcoin News , Bitcoin mining now accounts for 18% of Ethiopia’s electricity revenue , showcasing the potential for sustainable energy to power economic growth in Africa. How Ethiopia’s Bitcoin Mining Initiative Works 1. Utilizing Excess Hydropower The Grand Renaissance Dam, one of Africa’s largest hydropower projects, produces more electricity than Ethiopia currently consumes. Instead of letting this excess energy go to waste, the Ethiopian government has redirected it to power Bitcoin mining operations . 2. Global Investment Attraction The availability of low-cost, sustainable energy has attracted global investors to Ethiopia’s mining sector, boosting infrastructure development and foreign investment. 3. Government Support In February 2024 , the Ethiopian government signed agreements to supply electricity for Bitcoin mining, integrating cryptocurrency production into its broader economic strategy. Economic Impact of Bitcoin Mining in Ethiopia Ethiopia’s foray into Bitcoin mining has had significant implications for its economy: 1. Revenue Generation $1 Billion in Revenue : Mining operations have added a substantial revenue stream to Ethiopia’s economy, accounting for nearly one-fifth of its electricity revenue . Global Recognition : The initiative has placed Ethiopia on the map as an emerging player in the crypto and renewable energy sectors. 2. Energy Optimization Efficient Resource Use : By leveraging unused hydropower, Ethiopia has optimized its energy output while reducing waste. 3. Employment Opportunities The mining operations have created jobs in technology, logistics, and energy management, contributing to local economic development. Sustainable Energy Meets Cryptocurrency Ethiopia’s success highlights the synergy between sustainable energy and cryptocurrency mining: 1. Environmentally Friendly Mining Bitcoin mining often faces criticism for its high energy consumption. By using hydropower, Ethiopia offers a model for green mining practices . 2. Unlocking Africa’s Energy Potential Many African countries have untapped renewable energy resources. Ethiopia’s approach demonstrates how these resources can be monetized through innovative technologies like cryptocurrency mining. 3. Diversification of Revenue Streams By entering the cryptocurrency space, Ethiopia has diversified its economy, reducing reliance on traditional sectors like agriculture. Challenges and Risks Despite its success, Ethiopia’s Bitcoin mining initiative faces several challenges: 1. Regulatory Scrutiny As cryptocurrency adoption grows, regulatory frameworks may need to be strengthened to address concerns about transparency and governance. 2. Infrastructure Development Scaling mining operations requires significant investments in infrastructure, including cooling systems and network connectivity. 3. Market Volatility The profitability of Bitcoin mining is tied to cryptocurrency prices, exposing Ethiopia to market risks. Lessons for Other Nations Ethiopia’s Bitcoin mining strategy offers valuable insights for other countries, especially those with surplus renewable energy: Maximizing Resource Utilization : Countries with excess energy can emulate Ethiopia’s model to create new revenue streams. Fostering Innovation : Combining sustainable energy with blockchain technology can drive economic transformation. Engaging Global Investors : Ethiopia’s success demonstrates how strategic initiatives can attract foreign investment and expertise. Conclusion Ethiopia’s $1 billion Bitcoin mining milestone underscores the transformative potential of combining sustainable energy with innovative technology . By leveraging the Grand Renaissance Dam’s hydropower, Ethiopia has positioned itself as a leader in green cryptocurrency mining , offering a blueprint for other nations to follow. As the country continues to refine its approach and scale operations, Ethiopia’s journey highlights the vast opportunities at the intersection of renewable energy and the digital economy .

38181288,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=114879,1735300422,$14.3 Billion in Bitcoin Options to Expire on December 27: What It Means for the Crypto Market,"$14.3 Billion in Bitcoin Options to Expire on December 27: What It Means for the Crypto Market The cryptocurrency market is bracing for a major financial event as $14.3 billion worth of Bitcoin options are set to expire at 08:00 UTC on December 27, 2024. This massive options expiration is accompanied by the maturation of $3.75 billion in Ethereum (ETH) options, signaling a pivotal day for traders and market observers. The put/call ratio for Bitcoin options is reported at 0.69, with a max pain price of $85,000, according to Deribit, a leading crypto options exchange. For Ethereum, the put/call ratio stands at 0.41, with a max pain price of $3,000. These metrics offer crucial insights into market sentiment and potential price movements, providing traders with an opportunity to assess risk and strategy as the expiration approaches. Understanding Bitcoin Options Expiration Bitcoin options are derivative contracts that grant traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell BTC at a predetermined price before the contract expires. The expiration of options often leads to increased market volatility, as traders seek to adjust their positions. The put/call ratio —calculated by dividing the number of put options by call options—indicates the market’s sentiment. A ratio below 1, as observed with both Bitcoin (0.69) and Ethereum (0.41), suggests a bullish outlook. Meanwhile, the max pain price —the price point where the most options contracts expire worthless—provides insight into market manipulation strategies and trader losses. Bitcoin’s Max Pain Price: $85,000 The max pain price of $85,000 for Bitcoin reflects a significant point of interest for traders. This value represents the price at which the largest number of options contracts will expire worthless, leading to potential financial losses for traders. For Bitcoin to reach this max pain price, market activity and sentiment would need to align significantly, possibly triggering volatility in the hours leading up to expiration. Market participants will likely monitor price trends closely as this event unfolds. Traders positioned for either side of the options contracts—whether bullish or bearish—could see considerable gains or losses depending on the settlement price. Ethereum’s Max Pain Price: $3,000 Ethereum’s options market will also witness a substantial expiration on the same day, with $3.75 billion worth of contracts maturing. The max pain price of $3,000 reflects similar market dynamics. Although Ethereum’s market size is smaller than Bitcoin’s, the impact of its options expiration could still ripple across the broader cryptocurrency space. Impact on the Crypto Market The expiration of such a large volume of options often contributes to heightened volatility in the crypto market. With billions of dollars at stake, the event has implications for liquidity, market sentiment, and trading strategies. Liquidity Impact : Expirations often lead to increased liquidity as traders close out positions or roll contracts forward. Market Sentiment : The put/call ratios suggest a bullish sentiment for both Bitcoin and Ethereum, potentially pushing prices higher. Price Movements : The possibility of price manipulation around the max pain price is a concern, as large holders could influence market direction. What to Watch For Price Volatility : Expect sharp movements in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices as the expiration approaches.

38181251,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=114888,1735300283,"MIRA Meme Coin Reaches $80 Million Market Cap, Supporting Rare Brain Tumor Research","MIRA Meme Coin Reaches $80 Million Market Cap, Supporting Rare Brain Tumor Research The cryptocurrency community has witnessed the rise of a unique project, as the MIRA meme coin —a digital token created to support research on rare brain tumors in children—has reached an $80 million market capitalization. This milestone highlights the growing intersection of crypto innovation and philanthropic efforts, with MIRA emerging as a beacon of hope for families affected by rare diseases. The Story Behind MIRA Meme Coin The creation of MIRA meme coin was sparked by a heartfelt appeal from Siqi Chen, the CEO of a tech company, whose young daughter Mira was diagnosed with a rare brain tumor. Turning to the platform X (formerly Twitter), Chen called for donations to fund research into the disease. In an extraordinary act of solidarity, a user on Pump.fun, a platform dedicated to meme coins, created MIRA, a token designed to generate support and awareness for the cause. Soon after, an anonymous X user purchased 50% of the total supply of MIRA and transferred it to a project wallet under Chen’s control. This move transformed the meme coin from a niche initiative into a powerful tool for fundraising and advocacy. Reaching an $80 Million Market Cap As of December 27, 2024, the market capitalization of MIRA has reached $80 million. This remarkable growth is fueled by a combination of community-driven enthusiasm, philanthropic intent, and the broader appeal of meme coins in the crypto space. Siqi Chen has committed to liquidating $1,000 worth of MIRA tokens every 10 minutes, ensuring a steady flow of funds toward brain tumor research. This innovative approach demonstrates the potential of blockchain and cryptocurrencies to address real-world challenges through collective action. What Makes MIRA Unique? MIRA meme coin stands out in the crowded cryptocurrency market for several reasons: 1. A Philanthropic Mission Unlike most meme coins that thrive on humor or speculative trading, MIRA has a clear social purpose: supporting research on rare pediatric brain tumors. This mission has resonated deeply with the crypto community, driving widespread support. 2. Community-Driven Development The creation and subsequent success of MIRA underscore the power of community action. From its inception by a Pump.fun user to the large donation by an anonymous X user, MIRA’s journey reflects the decentralized and collaborative ethos of the blockchain space. 3. Sustainable Fundraising Through Chen’s planned liquidation strategy, MIRA ensures a consistent allocation of resources to its cause, balancing the volatility of crypto markets with the need for reliable funding. The Broader Impact of Meme Coins in Philanthropy The success of MIRA highlights a broader trend in the crypto industry: the use of meme coins for charitable causes. While meme coins have often been dismissed as speculative assets, projects like MIRA demonstrate their potential for meaningful impact. 1. Raising Awareness Meme coins have the power to reach a wide audience, leveraging humor, relatability, and virality to draw attention to important issues. 2. Mobilizing Communities Cryptocurrency communities are often highly engaged and action-oriented, making them ideal participants in philanthropic initiatives. 3. Innovating Fundraising Models Blockchain technology offers transparency and efficiency, ensuring that funds raised through meme coins are used for their intended purpose. Challenges and Opportunities While MIRA’s success is inspiring, it also highlights some challenges associated with combining cryptocurrencies and philanthropy: Volatility : Meme coins are notorious for price fluctuations, which could impact the stability of funds raised. Regulatory Scrutiny : As crypto projects grow in prominence, they may face increased regulatory oversight. Sustained Engagement : Maintaining long-term interest in a cause-driven meme coin requires ongoing community engagement and transparency. Despite these challenges, MIRA’s achievements demonstrate the immense opportunities for blockchain to drive social change. Conclusion The rise of the MIRA meme coin, with its $80 million market cap, showcases the transformative potential of cryptocurrencies in addressing real-world issues. Born out of a personal plea for help, MIRA has become a symbol of hope, innovation, and the power of community. As the crypto industry continues to evolve, projects like MIRA will likely inspire more initiatives that blend blockchain technology with philanthropy, proving that digital currencies can do more than just create wealth—they can create impact.

38181171,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=114892,1735300228,Analyst Jacob King Labels Bitcoin ‘Utterly Useless’: A Deep Dive into His Controversial Critique,"Analyst Jacob King Labels Bitcoin ‘Utterly Useless’: A Deep Dive into His Controversial Critique Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, has faced its fair share of criticism since its inception. Recently, Jacob King, an analyst from the cryptocurrency newsletter Whalewire, added fuel to the debate by sharing his polarizing take on X (formerly Twitter). King described Bitcoin as “utterly useless,” labeling it a “malignant grift” that thrives on speculative delusions and promises of easy profits. “The Greatest Thought Experiment of Our Lifetime” King began his critique by acknowledging Bitcoin’s conceptual ingenuity, calling it “the greatest thought experiment of our lifetime.” He highlighted its significance in showcasing how easily greed can manipulate human behavior. According to King, Bitcoin’s rise is a testament to the susceptibility of individuals to promises of quick wealth, often clouding rational judgment. From Online Gambling to Global Speculation In his post, King traced Bitcoin’s origins, arguing that it began as a niche tool for internet poker players seeking anonymity. Over time, however, he believes it has morphed into something far more concerning: A “Malignant Grift” King described Bitcoin as a predatory system, exploiting the hopes of everyday investors drawn by tales of astronomical returns. Speculative Frenzy He suggested that Bitcoin’s value is propped up not by utility but by “delusional speculators” who invest based on the fear of missing out (FOMO). A Dangerous Game Comparing the cryptocurrency market to a game of musical chairs, King warned that when the music stops, many will be left facing significant losses. Is Bitcoin Truly Useless? While King’s critique is scathing, it raises questions about Bitcoin’s true value and utility. Let’s examine some arguments for and against his claim: Arguments Supporting King’s Critique Lack of Intrinsic Value : Bitcoin does not generate cash flow like stocks or provide utility like commodities, leading critics to question its inherent worth. Energy Consumption : Bitcoin’s proof-of-work mining mechanism consumes vast amounts of electricity, leading to environmental concerns. Speculative Nature : Critics argue that Bitcoin’s value is driven more by hype than by tangible use cases. Counterarguments Digital Gold : Proponents liken Bitcoin to gold—a store of value rather than a traditional asset. Decentralization : Bitcoin offers an alternative to centralized financial systems, empowering users with greater control over their assets. Global Utility : In regions with unstable economies or restrictive monetary policies, Bitcoin provides a lifeline for transferring and preserving wealth. Bitcoin: A “Malignant Grift” or Revolutionary Technology? The label of “malignant grift” used by King is especially provocative. It suggests not only deception but also harm inflicted on those who invest. Yet, many argue that Bitcoin has achieved groundbreaking milestones: First Decentralized Cryptocurrency : Bitcoin introduced blockchain technology, inspiring thousands of other projects. Financial Inclusion : For unbanked populations, Bitcoin offers a means to participate in the global economy. Institutional Adoption : Despite criticisms, major companies and financial institutions have integrated Bitcoin into their portfolios and payment systems. The Risk of Speculative Bubbles King’s warning about Bitcoin being a “giant game of musical chairs” touches on a legitimate concern: market bubbles. Historically, speculative bubbles are characterized by: Overvaluation : Prices rise far beyond an asset’s fundamental value. FOMO : Investors pile in, fearing they’ll miss out on gains. Inevitable Collapse : When confidence wanes, prices plummet, leaving many with significant losses. Bitcoin’s meteoric rise and occasional sharp declines fit this pattern, fueling skepticism from analysts like King. Community Reactions to King’s Criticism King’s post on X has sparked heated discussions across the crypto community: Supporters of King’s View : Critics of Bitcoin have praised King for calling out what they see as fundamental flaws in the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Advocates : Proponents have countered his claims, arguing that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and adoption potential far outweigh its speculative risks. Conclusion Jacob King’s declaration that Bitcoin is “utterly useless” has reignited debates about the cryptocurrency’s true value and purpose. While his criticisms highlight undeniable risks associated with speculative behavior and environmental impact, Bitcoin’s supporters argue that its revolutionary technology and potential for financial inclusion are too significant to ignore. As Bitcoin continues to evolve, its utility, adoption, and market dynamics will remain central to discussions about its role in the global financial landscape. For investors and observers alike, King’s critique serves as a reminder to approach the cryptocurrency market with caution, critical thinking, and a clear understanding of risks.

38181135,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=114894,1735300161,Luxor COO Skeptical About Trump’s Promise to Mine All Remaining Bitcoin in the U.S.,"Luxor COO Skeptical About Trump’s Promise to Mine All Remaining Bitcoin in the U.S. Ethan Vera, Chief Operating Officer of Luxor Technologies, has raised concerns about President-elect Donald Trump’s ambitious promise to localize all remaining Bitcoin mining operations within the United States. Vera’s skepticism stems from the global distribution of mining power, where U.S.-based miners currently account for less than 50%, facing stiff competition from major mining hubs like China and Russia. Trump’s Vision for Bitcoin Mining in the U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to make the United States a dominant player in the Bitcoin mining industry. His plan involves localizing all remaining Bitcoin mining operations to strengthen the country’s position in the crypto space and ensure energy security while reducing reliance on foreign entities. This promise aligns with Trump’s broader agenda of “America First,” focusing on economic independence and technological leadership. However, such a bold commitment raises questions about its feasibility and the challenges involved. Why Luxor’s Ethan Vera Is Skeptical Ethan Vera, whose company Luxor Technologies specializes in Bitcoin mining and related services, outlined several key obstacles to achieving Trump’s goal: 1. Current Share of Mining Power U.S.-based Bitcoin miners control less than 50% of the global mining hash rate, with significant portions dominated by China, Russia, and other countries. This imbalance highlights the difficulty of centralizing mining operations solely within the U.S. 2. International Competition China : Despite regulatory crackdowns, China remains a key player due to its access to cheap hardware and energy. Russia : Benefiting from abundant natural resources, Russia has emerged as another major mining hub, leveraging its cold climate and inexpensive electricity. Emerging Markets : Countries in Central Asia and South America are also gaining traction, offering low-cost energy and favorable regulatory environments. 3. Infrastructure Challenges Scaling up Bitcoin mining in the U.S. requires significant investment in infrastructure, including data centers, power generation facilities, and advanced cooling systems. These demands could strain existing energy grids and face resistance from local communities concerned about environmental impacts. 4. Energy Consumption and Sustainability Bitcoin mining is energy-intensive, consuming vast amounts of electricity. Balancing Trump’s localization promise with sustainable energy practices presents another challenge, particularly given the growing emphasis on reducing carbon footprints. U.S. Bitcoin Mining Landscape The U.S. has made notable strides in Bitcoin mining, particularly following China’s crackdown on crypto activities in 2021. States like Texas, Wyoming, and Kentucky have emerged as mining hotspots due to their crypto-friendly policies and access to affordable energy. Advantages for U.S. Miners Stable Regulatory Environment : The U.S. offers greater legal clarity compared to many competitors. Access to Capital : American mining firms benefit from a well-developed financial ecosystem, allowing them to raise funds more easily. Innovation : Companies in the U.S. are at the forefront of developing efficient mining technologies and exploring renewable energy solutions. Remaining Challenges Despite these advantages, the U.S. must contend with high energy costs in some regions, logistical barriers, and competition for mining equipment. Global Competition: The Reality Check Trump’s plan to localize Bitcoin mining must contend with the decentralized and competitive nature of the global mining industry. China’s Mining Comeback Although China officially banned crypto mining in 2021, reports indicate a resurgence in underground operations. Chinese miners still access low-cost hardware and hydroelectric power during rainy seasons, maintaining their influence. Russia’s Expanding Hash Rate Russia’s colder climate and cheap electricity make it an attractive location for mining farms. The government has also expressed interest in regulating and supporting the industry, positioning itself as a competitor to U.S. dominance. Diversifying Geographies Countries like Kazakhstan, El Salvador, and Canada are investing in mining infrastructure, providing further diversification to the global mining network. Feasibility of Localizing Bitcoin Mining in the U.S. Trump’s pledge to localize Bitcoin mining raises important questions: Is Full Localization Achievable? Given the global nature of Bitcoin mining, achieving complete localization in the U.S. may be impractical. Instead, policies could focus on increasing the U.S. share of mining power while collaborating with global partners. How to Address Energy Concerns? Promoting renewable energy adoption in mining could align Trump’s vision with sustainability goals, making it more palatable to regulators and environmental advocates. Will It Require Policy Overhauls? Achieving significant progress may require incentives such as tax breaks, grants for renewable energy projects, and easing restrictions on industrial-scale mining operations. Conclusion Ethan Vera’s skepticism about Trump’s promise to centralize all Bitcoin mining operations in the U.S. underscores the complexity of the cryptocurrency mining landscape. While the U.S. has the potential to expand its influence in the sector, achieving full localization faces significant challenges, including global competition, infrastructure demands, and energy concerns. Trump’s vision, though ambitious, could serve as a catalyst for greater investment and innovation in the U.S. crypto mining industry. By addressing these challenges strategically, the U.S. might not only increase its share of Bitcoin mining but also set global standards for sustainable and efficient mining practices.

According to data from CryptoQuant contributor and market analyst Maartunn, the average USDT transaction size rose from $4,273 in June 2023 to $9,718 in December 2024 . This trend highlights increased activity from larger market participants, suggesting growing trust and adoption of the TRON blockchain. The Rise of USDT on TRON TRON has become one of the most prominent platforms for Tether transactions, rivaling Ethereum in terms of transaction volume and efficiency. The network’s low fees and high throughput make it an attractive choice for both retail and institutional users, fueling its growth as a major player in the stablecoin ecosystem. Key Milestones Increased Transaction Size : The doubling of average transaction size signals a shift towards larger transactions, potentially reflecting adoption by institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals. Dominance in Stablecoin Transfers : TRON now processes a significant portion of global USDT transfers, thanks to its efficient infrastructure. Why TRON Is Gaining Momentum The TRON Network’s growth in USDT transaction volume can be attributed to several key factors: 1. Low Transaction Fees TRON offers negligible fees compared to Ethereum, making it an appealing option for large transactions. This cost efficiency is particularly important for high-frequency and high-value transactions. 2. High Transaction Speed With the ability to process thousands of transactions per second, TRON provides a seamless experience for users who require fast and reliable transfers. 3.

The Role of USDT in Crypto Markets Tether (USDT) remains the most widely used stablecoin, serving as a critical liquidity tool in the cryptocurrency market. Its role as a stable, dollar-pegged asset makes it a preferred choice for traders and institutions alike. USDT on TRON vs. Ethereum Cost : TRON’s minimal fees offer a clear advantage over Ethereum’s sometimes unpredictable gas fees. Adoption : While Ethereum remains a hub for DeFi and NFTs, TRON’s focus on stablecoin transactions gives it an edge in this specific niche. Institutional Use Cases Larger USDT transaction sizes on TRON may reflect its increasing use for: Cross-border payments Arbitrage trading Settlement of large trades on centralized and decentralized exchanges Insights from CryptoQuant’s Maartunn Maartunn, a CryptoQuant contributor, emphasized that the growth in USDT transaction volume on TRON aligns with broader market trends, including the rising adoption of stablecoins for institutional purposes. The data suggests a shift from retail-driven activity to transactions dominated by larger players, reinforcing the narrative of maturing crypto markets. What Does This Mean for TRON? The surge in USDT transaction volume positions TRON as a leading blockchain for stablecoin transactions. Its ability to attract larger market participants bodes well for its long-term adoption and competitiveness. Potential Impacts Enhanced Market Position : TRON could further solidify its role as the go-to platform for stablecoin transfers. Ecosystem Growth : Increased activity may attract more developers and projects to the TRON ecosystem. Increased Competition : Other networks, such as Ethereum Layer 2 solutions, may need to innovate to compete with TRON’s cost and efficiency advantages. Challenges Ahead Despite its growth, TRON faces challenges that could impact its trajectory: Regulatory Scrutiny : Stablecoins like USDT are under increased regulatory focus, which could affect their adoption across platforms. Competition : Networks such as Solana, Avalanche, and Ethereum Layer 2 solutions continue to evolve, offering alternatives to TRON. Scalability Demands : As transaction volume grows, TRON must ensure its network remains scalable and efficient. Conclusion The doubling of USDT’s average transaction size on the TRON Network reflects its growing appeal among larger market participants, including institutions and high-net-worth individuals. With low fees, high transaction speeds, and robust infrastructure, TRON has established itself as a major player in the stablecoin ecosystem. As the cryptocurrency market matures, TRON’s continued success will depend on its ability to address challenges while capitalizing on the increasing adoption of stablecoins. The network’s rise is a testament to the evolving dynamics of the blockchain industry and the critical role that stablecoins like USDT play in global finance.

38180910,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=114908,1735299747,"BGB Price Rises by Over 25% in 24 Hours, Surpasses $7 Mark","BGB Price Rises by Over 25% in 24 Hours, Surpasses $7 Mark The native utility token of the Bitget crypto exchange, Bitget Token (BGB) , has experienced a significant price surge, climbing over 25% in the past 24 hours . According to CoinMarketCap , BGB is currently trading at $7.20 , reflecting growing market enthusiasm and interest in the token. What Is BGB? BGB is the native utility token of Bitget , a leading cryptocurrency exchange known for its focus on social trading and copy trading features. The token offers various utilities, including: Trading Fee Discounts : BGB holders enjoy reduced fees on the platform. Exclusive Access : Certain features and promotions are unlocked for BGB holders. Staking Rewards : Users can stake BGB for additional benefits or yields. The recent price surge has brought renewed attention to BGB, raising questions about the factors driving its growth and its potential trajectory. Key Factors Behind the Price Surge Several factors have contributed to the sharp increase in BGB’s price: 1. Increased Platform Adoption Bitget has been expanding its user base and introducing new features, which may have boosted demand for BGB. Social Trading Popularity : As social trading gains traction, more users are joining Bitget, increasing the utility of BGB. Market Expansion : Bitget’s entry into new regions could be driving fresh interest in the platform and its token. 2. Positive Market Sentiment The overall crypto market has seen pockets of bullish activity, which may have contributed to increased interest in utility tokens like BGB. 3. Tokenomics and Scarcity With a limited supply of tokens, increased demand for BGB naturally drives its price upward. 4. Speculative Trading As BGB’s price rises, it may attract traders looking to capitalize on short-term gains, further fueling momentum. BGB’s Performance Metrics Metric Value Current Price $7.20 24-Hour Increase +26.30% Market Cap Rank Top 100 The significant price movement has propelled BGB into the spotlight, with trading volumes rising in tandem. What’s Next for BGB? 1. Potential for Further Growth If Bitget continues to expand its offerings and attract new users, demand for BGB could rise further, potentially pushing its price higher. 2. Market Volatility As with any crypto asset, volatility is a given. Investors should be prepared for potential price corrections after such a steep climb. 3. Long-Term Utility The sustainability of BGB’s growth will depend on its ongoing utility within the Bitget ecosystem and the platform’s ability to retain users. Should You Consider BGB? For those considering BGB as an investment, here are some points to consider: Advantages : Strong utility within a growing exchange. Potential for staking rewards and fee discounts. Risks : Price volatility could lead to short-term losses. Dependence on Bitget’s success as a platform. Conclusion The recent 25% surge in BGB’s price , surpassing the $7 mark, underscores the growing interest in utility tokens tied to popular crypto exchanges like Bitget. While the token’s rise reflects positive momentum, potential investors should weigh its long-term utility against the inherent volatility of the crypto market.

38182468,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323002,1735299697,"Cambodia’s Central Bank Greenlights Stablecoins and Backed Coins, Excludes Bitcoin","The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) has permitted commercial banks and payment institutions to offer services involving Category 1 crypto assets, such as backed or stable cryptocurrencies. This marks the first time the NBC has approved such services, as outlined in a directive issued on December 26 and announced on December 27, according to a report by the Phnom Penh Post . However, unbacked cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin remain prohibited. Cambodia Aims to Regulate Digital Currencies The directive seeks to regulate operations involving digital currencies, reflecting Cambodia’s efforts to align with global financial trends. Under the new rules, institutions must obtain prior approval from NBC to engage in activities such as exchanging crypto assets for fiat currencies, transferring crypto assets between accounts, and offering custody services. Notably, these institutions are barred from utilizing customers’ crypto assets for their own purposes. Historically, Cambodia has maintained a strict stance against cryptocurrencies, citing risks like fraud, money laundering, and illicit activities, which have previously led to a ban on trading and transactions. Economic researcher Hong Vanak of the Royal Academy of Cambodia told the Phnom Penh Post that the growing global use of cryptocurrencies alongside their decentralized nature complicates regulation, taxation, and tracking. Vanak argued that cryptocurrencies provide limited benefits to Cambodia’s economy but suggested that banks and institutions offering crypto-related services could generate revenue through user fees. Cambodia Blocks Access to 16 Crypto Exchanges Earlier this month, Cambodia blocked access to 16 cryptocurrency exchange websites, including major platforms like Binance, Coinbase, and OKX, as part of its ongoing effort to regulate the digital asset market. The action followed a directive signed by acting TRC chairman Srun Kimsann, which restricted access to 102 domains, primarily targeting online gambling sites. Crypto exchange websites were included in the crackdown due to their lack of licensing from the Securities and Exchange Regulator of Cambodia (SERC). While website access has been restricted, mobile applications for these platforms remain available. Currently, only two companies have licenses under SERC’s “FinTech Regulatory Sandbox” program. These entities can trade digital assets but are prohibited from exchanging cryptocurrencies for Cambodia’s legal tender or other fiat currencies. Cambodia's National Bank Authorises Crypto Transactions For Commercial Banks https://t.co/IAS7KHrmpq — B2B Cambodia (@B2BMedia_Cambo) December 27, 2024 Despite these measures, Cambodia remains a global leader in retail crypto use per capita, according to analytics firm Chainalysis. Centralized exchanges account for 70% of crypto transactions in the country. However, the country faces scrutiny for crypto-related criminal activities. The UN Office of Drugs and Crime reported that criminal organizations in Cambodia use cryptocurrencies for money laundering and dark-web transactions. Chainalysis identified over $49 billion in crypto transactions between 2021 and mid-2024 facilitated by Huione Guarantee, a marketplace within the Cambodian conglomerate Huione Group.

38180909,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=114910,1735299689,"BTC Yet to Enter Bubble Phase, Says CryptoQuant CEO: Key Insights into the Bull Run","BTC Yet to Enter Bubble Phase, Says CryptoQuant CEO: Key Insights into the Bull Run Bitcoin (BTC) remains in a bull run and is far from entering a bubble phase, according to Ki Young Ju , CEO of on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant. Writing on X (formerly Twitter), Ju highlighted that the current market dynamic shows whales dominating Bitcoin accumulation while retail investors are stepping back. On-chain data reveals $7 billion in weekly capital inflows , a clear indicator of robust market activity and sustained upward momentum. Bitcoin’s Current Market Dynamics Ju pointed out a critical shift in market behavior: Whale Dominance : Large-scale investors, or whales, are accumulating Bitcoin at a pace that no longer surprises the market, unlike in previous cycles. Retail Pullback : Retail investors appear less active, creating a market environment dominated by institutional and high-net-worth players. This dynamic is a departure from earlier bull runs, where retail enthusiasm often drove speculative bubbles. Why Bitcoin Is Not in a Bubble Phase The CryptoQuant CEO explained that the current bull market has not yet entered the exuberant “bubble phase” typically marked by unsustainable price surges and widespread retail FOMO (fear of missing out). Key Indicators Supporting This View Sustained Capital Inflows On-chain data shows $7 billion flowing into the Bitcoin market weekly , providing a stable foundation for price growth. Unlike speculative bubbles, this inflow is primarily driven by informed investors. Controlled Volatility While short-term corrections are possible, Ju predicts these will be limited to less than 30%. Even if such dips occur, they are likely to be followed by rapid recoveries, indicating strong support levels. Cycle Top Not Reached Ju emphasized that Bitcoin’s price has not yet approached the euphoric peaks typically seen at the top of bull cycles. He dismissed bearish predictions, asserting that those forecasting a bear run are ignoring the on-chain data. Comparison with Past Bull Runs Bitcoin’s behavior in 2024 differs from previous cycles in notable ways: Cycle Key Driver Retail Involvement Bubble Phase Indicators 2017 ICO boom, retail speculation High Extreme price surges, FOMO 2021 Institutional adoption, DeFi Moderate NFT mania, overleveraged positions 2024 Whale accumulation, macro trends Low None yet observed The absence of bubble-like behavior in the current cycle reflects a maturing market, with capital inflows primarily from experienced investors and institutions. Short-Term Correction vs. Long-Term Growth Ju cautioned that a short-term correction is possible but unlikely to derail the bull market. Corrections during bull runs are often temporary, offering opportunities for further accumulation. Potential Scenarios Short-Term Dip A correction of up to 30% could occur, driven by profit-taking or macroeconomic factors. Ju predicts such dips would be short-lived, as strong demand would quickly push prices higher. Post-Correction Surge Following any dip, Bitcoin could rebound with gains exceeding 30%, fueled by renewed investor confidence and continued inflows. Cycle Top Still Distant On-chain data suggests the top of this Bitcoin cycle remains far off, leaving room for significant price appreciation. The Role of On-Chain Data in Market Predictions Ju’s analysis emphasizes the importance of on-chain metrics in understanding market trends: Capital Inflows : Measure the strength of demand for Bitcoin. Whale Accumulation : Tracks large investor activity, often a precursor to price stability or growth. Retail Activity : Gauges speculative behavior, which can signal bubble formation. By focusing on these indicators, CryptoQuant provides a data-driven perspective that contrasts with speculative narratives often seen in the market. What This Means for Investors For Bitcoin traders and investors, Ju’s insights offer a roadmap for navigating the current market: Patience Is Key : The absence of a bubble phase suggests there is still room for long-term growth. Opportunities in Corrections : Short-term dips could present buying opportunities for those confident in the bull run. Data-Driven Decisions : On-chain data provides valuable insights into market health and trends, reducing reliance on speculation. Conclusion CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju’s analysis provides a compelling argument that Bitcoin remains in a strong bull cycle, with no signs of entering a speculative bubble. The dominance of whales, coupled with sustained capital inflows, underpins a market that is maturing and stabilizing. While short-term corrections may occur, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains optimistic, with significant potential for growth as the cycle progresses. Investors would do well to stay informed, relying on on-chain data and market trends to guide their decisions.

However, a popular trading metric used to gauge buyer interest in Binance suggests that the cryptocurrency could revisit this crucial price level before the end of the year. Strengthening Buying Pressure on Binance Over the past 60 days, Binance’s Bitcoin Taker Buy Volume has reached $8.3 billion and formed three higher lows, indicative of strengthening buying pressure. This metric, which measures the total volume of buy transactions executed by market participants at current order book prices, reflects increasing investor interest in Bitcoin. According to CryptoQuant’s analysis , the rise in Taker Buy Volume on Binance has been steady despite occasional market corrections. This growing buying pressure often correlates with potential price increases, as it indicates that buyers are actively consuming available liquidity at market prices. While the market may appear overheated, the persistence of this trend points to a possible upward price movement in the near term. Meanwhile, Bitcoin reserves on Binance have reached their lowest levels since early 2024, following a decline that started in August. This mirrors January’s low, which preceded a 90% rally in BTC’s price. Coupled with a 40,000 BTC drop in OTC desk inventories since November, this trend could potentially indicate rising demand and investor confidence ahead of a much-anticipated bullish reversal. Bitcoin’s Next Move Bitcoin has remained below the $100,000 mark since December 19, following its initial breakthrough on December 5. With its current value hovering around $96,000, the crypto asset has dropped over 12% from its record high of $108,300 reached on December 17. However, several experts foresee a bullish breakout. The pseudonymous “xoom,” for one, recently highlighted a bullish engulfing candle with rising volume, indicating a potential price target of $110K to $130K by January’s end, with $120K as a realistic target. Despite possible short-term volatility, the trend suggests BTC could climb to $135K or higher in the coming months. Another pseudonymous crypto analyst, “Titan of Crypto,” said that Bitcoin’s current price action appears to be similar to the correction fractal from late 2023. Interestingly, 2024’s movements are roughly three weeks ahead in the timeline. While the analyst does not guarantee the same scenario will unfold, the similarities highlight potential bullish momentum, as the cryptocurrency may replicate its previous trajectory and break toward new highs if the pattern persists.

Amid a quick recovery in the crypto market over the past few hours, the meme coin market cap has surged from $94 billion to its current level of $97.38 billion. As the meme segment experiences a rise in buying pressure, Dogecoin is back in action.With a 13% increase over the past 7 days, Dogecoin's market cap now stands at $47.15 billion. With a year-end rally looking increasingly likely, will Dogecoin stage a breakout?DOGE Price AnalysisOn the 4-hour chart, Dogecoin's price action shows a gradual increase in bearish influence. The lower-high formation following a failed attempt to break above $0.4842 has kept Dogecoin under the resistance of a trendline. This has led to three bearish reversals. Additionally, the correction phase has resulted in a death cross between the 50- and 200-period SMAs and a bearish crossover between the 100- and 200-period SMAs. This alignment of the SMAs is bearish on the 4-hour chart.After the death cross, the 50-SMA continues to act as dynamic resistance, keeping Dogecoin's price under bearish control. Currently, Dogecoin is trading within a consolidation range between the 23.60% and 38.20% Fibonacci levels.Meanwhile, the crucial support zone at $0.30, along with the 23.60% Fibonacci level, acts as a cushion. Dogecoin is currently priced at $0.3202, forming a bullish engulfing candle, marking a 2.90% increase in the past 4 hours. This recovery counters the 6.48% drop from the previous night, which had formed a bearish engulfing daily candle.Dogecoin Price TargetsAs the intraday recovery gains momentum, Dogecoin is hinting at a potential breakout above the 50-SMA line. This would increase the likelihood of Dogecoin closing above the long-standing resistance trendline.Further supporting the chances of a breakout rally, the 4-hour RSI shows a bullish divergence between the last two bottom formations within the consolidation range.If this breakout occurs, the next target will likely be the 200-SMA line, corresponding to the 61.80% Fibonacci level at $0.3913.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN.

A Historic $18 Billion Moment Will Happen! What Does It Signal for BTC and ETH Prices?,"Bitcoin (BTC) is preparing to leave behind a year full of rises under the influence of Donald Trump. Bitcoin broke records one after another in 2024 and exceeded $100,000 for the first time in its history. However, while Bitcoin has been exhibiting volatile movements in recent days, the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency market is approaching the last days of 2024 with the largest option maturity in history. Like every Friday, today is the expiration date for option contracts in the crypto market. These options are of even greater importance as they fall on the last Friday of December, the last quarter of the year 2024. According to Deribit data, a total of $18 billion worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum option contracts will expire today. Accordingly, the Put/Call Ratio of BTC options is 0.69, the maximum loss point is $85,000 and the notional value is $14.38 billion. When we look at Ethereum, ETH options have a Put/Call Ratio of 0.41, a maximum loss point of $3,000, and a notional value of $3.7 billion. Deribit CEO Luuk Strijers said: “The previously dominant bullish momentum in Bitcoin has stalled, leaving the market heavily leveraged to the upside. This increases the risk of a rapid snowball effect if a significant downside move occurs. All eyes are on this deadline because it has the potential to determine what the narrative in Bitcoin will be as we head into the new year.” What Does the Put/Call Ratio Signal for Bitcoin and Ethereum? The put/call ratio is calculated by dividing the number of put options by the number of call options. A ratio below 1 means there are more buys than puts, indicating an uptrend. A ratio above 1 means there are more puts than calls, indicating a downtrend. A ratio close to 1 means the market is balanced or neutral. For Bitcoin, this ratio is 0.69; for Ethereum, it is 0.41. Accordingly, these ratios theoretically indicate an upward trend for BTC and ETH. However, time will tell how these ratios will affect the price. At this point, do not make your investment decisions based on a single data or report. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Today in Bitcoin and Ethereum!

38181249,https://invezz.com/?p=2407535,1735298765,"Bitwise seeks approval for ETF tracking companies holding over 1,000 BTC","Bitwise has filed an application to list and trade shares of an exchange-traded fund that will track companies holding significant amounts of Bitcoin as part of their treasury. The asset management firm’s regulatory filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Dec. 26 outlines the ‘Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF’ as a fund that will invest in companies with more than 1000 BTC in treasury reserves. Per the SEC filing , the new Bitcoin ETF targets the securities of publicly traded companies in the Bitwise Securities Index. Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF The fund will include companies with at least $100 million in market cap and an average of $1 million in daily liquidity. Bitwise’s “Bitcoin standard” exchange-traded fund will feature weighting based on the overall value of BTC held rather than the size of the company’s market cap. In this case, the ETF’s weighting for Marathon Digital Holdings will be higher than that of Tesla. This is because the Bitcoin mining firm Marathon Digital’s holdings of more than 44,000 BTC is greater than Tesla’s total of 9,720 BTC. Despite this, the ETF will not feature a stock weighting of more than 25% for any of the components. Bitwise says the goal is to ensure diversification as well as avoid overexposing investors to any one BTC holding company. “The Index selects for inclusion each eligible security that complies with the size, liquidity and free float requirements. Each security selected for inclusion is then assigned weight based upon the market value of its bitcoin holdings, subject to certain diversification requirements, including that single constituents are capped at a maximum weight of 25% at each Index rebalance, with any excess weight being reallocated to other constituents on an equal-weighted basis,” the SEC filing reads in part. Bitcoin treasuries traction Bitwise’s latest filing for a BTC ETF comes as the global trend in the number of public companies adopting the flagship asset as treasury strategy picks momentum. In recent months, inspired by the massive gains in BTC price and what MicroStrategy has achieved, multiple publicly listed companies have announced their adoption plans. The adoption cuts across tech, pharmaceuticals, sports, computing, and video sharing. Rumble, Interactive Strength, Hoth Therapeutics, Anixa Biosciences, and Nano Labs are among those to take this initiative and announce notable Bitcoin purchases. KULR Technology Group announced its Bitcoin treasury strategy on Dec. 26, revealing a 217.18 BTC purchase worth $21 million. According to data from Bitcoin Treasuries , there are currently about 73 public companies in a total of 149 entities holding BTC. While ETFs and other funds lead with nearly 1.3 million BTC in treasuries, public companies make the second largest holders with over 587.6k BTC. MicroStrategy, the world’s largest corporate holder of BTC, accounts for most of these with 444,262 BTC after its latest purchase. Meanwhile, governments and private companies are the third and fourth largest with over 513k and 408k BTC respectively.

38180400,https://btc-pulse.com/?p=27863,1735298695,Former FTX Executive Ryan Salame’s Prison Sentence Reduced by One Year,"Ryan Salame’s Sentence Reduced The United States Bureau of Prisons recently updated the release date for Ryan Salame, the former co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets, reducing his prison sentence by one year. Salame was scheduled to be released in April 2032 but is now scheduled to leave custody in March 2031. The authorities have not given any official reasons for this adjustment, though. Background on Salame’s Conviction In September 2023, Salame pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business and one count of campaign finance fraud, among others, over his role in the now-infamous collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX. He was sentenced to 7.5 years in federal prison and three years of supervised release after his guilty plea in May 2023. The collapse of FTX had widespread ramifications, and Salame – although contested – was very much at the center of extensive legal scrutiny. Prior to the recent sentence reduction, his release date was set for April 2032. Legal Battles and Sentencing Debates Salame’s legal team had earlier sought a much lighter sentence, asking for no more than 18 months. His lawyers underlined the considerable forfeiture of assets as adequate punishment and underlined that Salame was not heavily involved in the core fraudulent activities of FTX. They insisted he had no knowledge of the criminal schemes engineered by the company’s leadership. Notwithstanding these, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan finally sentenced Salame to 90 months, citing the immense financial losses from FTX’s collapse and the seriousness of the case. Federal prosecutors had asked for a sentence ranging from 5 to 7 years earlier, but Kaplan outdid their recommendations. Disagreements over Plea Deal In August 2023, Salame moved to withdraw his guilty plea, claiming federal prosecutors reneged on a major part of their agreement. He said that in exchange for his guilty plea, prosecutors gave the impression that they would stop investigating his partner, Michelle Bond, for campaign finance violations. But reportedly, investigations into Bond did resume, and that fact fueled Salame’s motion to invalidate the plea agreement. Final Sentencing Developments All of Salame’s efforts to delay the sentence or void the plea, however, never materialized, and in October 2023, he turned himself in to the medium-security FCI Cumberland. While confirmation of a reduction in sentence has come, correction officials remain mum about why it has been revised.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/former-ftx-executive-ryan-salames-prison-sentence/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

Decentralized finance protocol Frax ( FRAX ) Finance is getting ready to launch its new stablecoin , frxUSD. But first, the protocol needs to determine whether to adopt Blackrock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund or BUIDL as its reserve asset. To make this decision, Frax Finance shared a proposal that introduces the features, benefits and background necessary to understand BUIDL and how it will function as a an on-chain, backing asset for Frax USD. The protocol has invited the Frax community to vote on whether the partnership will proceed. “The vote to onboard Blackrock $BUIDL as the first backing asset for the new Frax USD (frxUSD) stablecoin is live!” wrote Frax Finance on its official X post . On Dec. 23, Frax Finance announced that BlackRock, the leading asset management firm, proposed to become the custodian backing Frax USD in a separate X post . https://twitter.com/fraxfinance/status/1872356878308851948 You might also like: BlackRock eyes BUIDL token as collateral in crypto derivatives market: report According to the shared proposal, BUIDL is a tokenized product that invests all of its total assets into government-issued assets, namely cash, U.S. Treasury bills, repurchased agreements, notes, and other obligations. It is promoted as a “blockchain-based investment solution that can be used alongside other investments as a reserve backing of stable assets.” Some of the benefits of holding BUIDL as a reserve backing assets listed in the proposal include generating yield opportunities, strengthening liquidity, providing multiple transfer options, as well as minimizing external risk with the aid of major financial firms such as Securitize, BlackRock, and Bank of New York Mellon. “By working with Securitize and BlackRock to use BUIDL as a backing asset for Frax USD, Frax USD will gain exposure to one of the most liquid assets in the world, while still reaping the benefits of yield-bearing, on-chain efficiencies of DeFi,” wrote Nader Ghazvini, Head of Governance at Frax Finance. In July 2024, BlackRock tokenized treasury fund BUIDL gained more than $500 million in assets under management after its launch in April this year. BUIDL’s price is pegged to the U.S. dollar, investors receive daily accrued dividends paid directly on a monthly basis through its partnership with Securitize.

38181248,https://invezz.com/?p=2407498,1735298477,"Hackers use fake Zoom links to target crypto users, steal $1M: report","A sophisticated phishing scam targeting cryptocurrency users has been uncovered, exploiting fake Zoom meeting links to distribute malware and steal assets. The operation, exposed by blockchain security firm SlowMist , saw hackers mimicking Zoom’s platform to compromise sensitive information, including private keys and wallet credentials. This malicious campaign, active since November 2024, has resulted in significant financial losses, with over $1 million traced to a hacker’s Ethereum wallet. The attackers utilised advanced malware and obfuscation techniques, emphasising the growing risk of cyber threats in the crypto industry. Fake Zoom links deployed to steal cryptocurrency Hackers used a phishing domain, “app[.]us4zoom[.]us,” designed to replicate Zoom’s interface. Victims were deceived into clicking a “Launch Meeting” button that initiated a malicious download instead of launching the application. The fake installer, “ZoomApp_v.3.14.dmg,” executed a script named “ZoomApp.file,” prompting users to enter their system passwords. Upon execution, the script deployed a hidden executable file, “.ZoomApp,” which attempted to access sensitive information, including browser cookies, KeyChain data, and cryptocurrency wallet credentials. This data was compressed and transmitted to a malicious server associated with an IP flagged by multiple threat intelligence services. Further investigation revealed that the malware targeted high-value assets by focusing on users likely to hold significant cryptocurrency balances. The attackers used a combination of social engineering and advanced coding techniques to bypass security protocols, making the scam harder to detect. Their ability to impersonate a trusted platform like Zoom demonstrates the growing sophistication of phishing operations. The malware, identified as a Trojan, underwent static and dynamic analysis. It showed capabilities to decrypt data, extract system credentials, and access private keys and wallet mnemonics. These actions enabled the theft of cryptocurrency from victims, with attackers allegedly utilising Russian-language scripts and a back-end system located in the Netherlands. On-chain tracking reveals stolen Ethereum SlowMist employed its anti-money laundering tool, MistTrack, to trace stolen cryptocurrency. Over $1 million in digital assets, including Ethereum (ETH), USD0++, and MORPHO, was transferred across platforms such as Binance, Gate.io, and Bybit. One hacker’s address consolidated 296 ETH, which was further distributed to multiple platforms. Another wallet linked to the scam executed small ETH transactions to nearly 8,800 addresses, covering transaction fees. These stolen funds were subsequently aggregated and converted into Tether (USDT) and other cryptocurrencies via exchanges like FixedFloat and Binance. How does this affect crypto security? This phishing campaign underscores the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks targeting cryptocurrency users. Exploiting popular platforms like Zoom, attackers leveraged advanced techniques to steal private information and assets. The incident highlights the need for heightened vigilance, robust security protocols, and user education to prevent further exploitation in the rapidly evolving digital asset space. Governments and crypto exchanges are being urged to enhance their fraud detection measures and develop stronger countermeasures to combat such attacks. This includes raising awareness among users about recognising phishing schemes and adopting multi-factor authentication to secure their wallets.

38182465,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322999,1735298245,Pig Butchering Crypto Scams Cost Victims $3.6B in 2024: Report,"According to a report by Web3 security firm Cyvers, publicized through Nairametrics, pig butchering scams emerged as the most significant threat to crypto users in 2024, accounting for $3.6 billion in losses. This type of long-term fraud, which involves scammers grooming victims over time to siphon funds, primarily targeted users on the Ethereum blockchain . The report highlights a 40% increase in cyber threats compared to the previous year, with 165 incidents causing $2.3 billion in damages. While this is a decline from the $3.96 billion lost in 2023, the persistence of these schemes has become the main topic of discussion, exposing the vulnerabilities within the crypto ecosystem. Access control breaches were the primary attack vector, leading to $1.9 billion in losses across 67 incidents. Smart contract exploits and address poisoning were also significant, resulting in $456.8 million and $68.7 million in losses, respectively. Despite ongoing recovery efforts, including the return of $1.3 billion through bug bounty programs and on-chain investigations, pig butchering scams continue to outpace other forms of crypto fraud $3.6 Billion Stolen in 2024’s Pig Butchering Scams This year saw the crypto world rocked by pig butchering scams, which swindled unsuspecting users out of a jaw-dropping $3.6 billion—most of it on Ethereum. Read more on @nairametrics at: https://t.co/75rZ5fNOUM These scams… — Cyvers Alerts (@CyversAlerts) December 27, 2024 Pig Butchering Scams: How Scammers Steal Crypto From Victims Pig butchering scams involve long-term manipulation where victims are contacted through unsolicited messages and drawn into fraudulent crypto investment schemes. The scammers build trust by engaging with victims over time, eventually convincing them to transfer large amounts of money to fake investment platforms. According to Cyvers, Ethereum was the most affected blockchain this year, with over 150,000 addresses and 800,000 transactions involved in these scams. As the report pointed out, one factor contributing to Ethereum’s vulnerability is its open and accessible nature, which allows scammers to send numerous small payments to potential victims as part of their grooming process. These microtransactions are designed to build familiarity and credibility before the larger theft occurs. As one of the proposed solutions, the CEO of Cyvers, Deddy Lavid, shared that educating users on access control breaches and enhancing exchange transparency are crucial in mitigating the risks associated with pig butchering scams. The report notes that most scams involved Tether (USDT) and were laundered through centralized and decentralized exchanges, including Binance, HTX, OKX, and Coinbase. Notably, the scams followed a recurring pattern. Stolen funds were funneled through multiple networks, making it difficult for authorities to track and recover assets. Major Incidents and Recovery Efforts in 2024 According to the report, access control breaches and exchange vulnerabilities dominated the largest crypto thefts in 2024. Among the most significant incidents was the $305 million hack of Japanese exchange DMM Bitcoin , caused by a compromised private key in the platform’s hot wallet. Similarly, WazirX, India’s largest exchange, lost $235 million due to a multi-sig wallet vulnerability . Radiant Capital also suffered a $50 million loss after attackers compromised employee devices , while BingX lost $52 million through hot wallet exploits . Despite these substantial losses, recovery efforts have yielded some positive results. On-chain detectives like ZachXBT played a crucial role in recovering $1.3 billion in stolen funds throughout 2024. Among his recent discoveries was the $500K stolen through X account hacks . 1/3 A threat actor has stolen ~$500K over the past month by compromising 15+ X accounts (Kick, Cursor, Alex Blania, The Arena, Brett, etc) from sending targeted phishing emails which impersonated the X team to steal credentials and then launch meme coin scams. pic.twitter.com/HEWQdVICgJ — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) December 24, 2024 Just yesterday, Dec 26, a report showed a new X account was hacked to promote fake token .

38180368,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633858,1735298185,Matrixport shares the greatest risk to Bitcoin’s bull market in 2025,"Multiple risks to Bitcoin’s 2025 bull market have emerged, according to a new report from Matrixport. The report outlines threats ranging from BlackRock’s concerns about Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap to Google’s advances in quantum computing. The warnings come as Bitcoin faces pressure on multiple fronts. Leading analysts, including Peter Brandt and Tone Vays, have identified technical patterns suggesting a potential drop to the $70,000-$73,000 range. These technical warnings align with Matrixport ‘s broader analysis of macro risks, including changing Federal Reserve policy expectations and potential impacts from Trump’s upcoming presidency. BlackRock questions BTC supply and accompanying threats BlackRock had posed a question about the guarantee of Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap. As one of the largest asset managers now involved in Bitcoin through ETFs, BlackRock’s statement carries weight in market discussions. Google’s announcement of its “Willow” quantum chip, featuring 105 qubits, has brought quantum computing threats back into focus. While current quantum technology cannot break Bitcoin’s cryptographic defenses, the pace of advancement raises questions about long-term security. The report notes that quantum computing remains in its early stages, lacking the scale needed to pose an immediate threat to Bitcoin’s security model. The Federal Reserve’s updated inflation outlook adds another layer of uncertainty. According to Matrixport, the Fed members have raised their inflation expectations, citing concerns about Trump’s potential tariff policies rather than traditional economic factors like supply bottlenecks or growth rates. Matrixport’s inflation model indicates these concerns may be overstated, potentially allowing the Fed to maintain an accommodative policy through 2025. During Trump’s first term, similar tariffs had little impact on inflation. This suggests that the Fed’s current projections might not match economic realities. Technical analysis points to deeper correction Three prominent analysts have identified $95,000 as a critical price level for Bitcoin. Tone Vays warns that trading below this threshold opens the path for a correction to $73,000. This analysis aligns with Peter Brandt’s identification of a “broadening triangle” pattern, which projects a potential drop to $70,000. On-chain data supports these technical warnings. Price analysis shows limited wallet support between current levels and $70,085, creating what traders call “open air” below $93,806. On the other hand, @fundstrat maintains that #Bitcoin $BTC will likely reach $250,000 in 2025, but first, according to @MarkNewtonCMT , a downswing to $60,000 is on the horizon. pic.twitter.com/44rG8EVUV4 — Ali (@ali_charts) December 26, 2024 This gap in strong support levels means Bitcoin could move quickly through this range if selling pressure increases. The concentration of predictions around the $70,000-$73,000 range from different analytical approaches adds weight to this target zone. Historical price patterns from previous bull markets help explain why these support levels matter. Past corrections during bull markets have often found support at previous resistance levels, making the $70,000 area particularly important as it marked Bitcoin’s previous all-time high before the recent breakout. This price zone also coincides with institutional entry points from late 2024, suggesting potential buying interest at these levels. Political and monetary policy risks According to Matrixport, the Fed’s monetary policy outlook faces new pressures as Trump’s presidency approaches. The FOMC may adopt a more hawkish stance in response to potential fiscal policies under Trump. This could create uncertainty for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. This shift marks a change from December 2021, when the move away from near-zero interest rates began a new policy cycle. The regulatory situation has often influenced Bitcoin bull markets at key turning points. Past examples show how regulatory actions can end bull cycles. China’s PBoC banned banks from crypto dealings in January 2017, the SEC took action against unregistered fundraising in December 2017, and China restricted crypto mining in May 2021. While many regulatory concerns have eased with the SEC’s approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs, new policy challenges could come up. Looking ahead to 2025, the interaction between Trump’s fiscal policies and Fed responses may determine Bitcoin’s price direction. Matrixport’s inflation model, which predicted the 2023 bull market when others forecasted recession, suggests inflation should not pose major problems next year. However, the combination of new fiscal policies, changing Fed responses, and evolving regulatory frameworks creates a complex environment for Bitcoin’s price development through 2025.

BTC 6-month price chart. Source: FInbold Indeed, BTC performance in the last 7 to 10 days has been so lackluster that numerous cryptocurrency and on-chain analysts have started forecasting a significant plunge for the digital asset, even if many of them still see a longer-term rally. Analysts forecast Bitcoin flash crash as BTC rejects breakout above $100,000 A major trigger for the bearish prediction has been Bitcoin’s recent inability to find a stable footing above $95,000. The world’s premier cryptocurrency has spent much of the last week trading roughly in the range between $92,000 and $99,000 though most of the trading has been closer to the lower bound. Such a trend prompted Tone Vays, a derivatives trader and financial educator, for example, to forecast that, unless BTC manages to stably reclaim levels above $95,000, it could face a correction to $73,000. Peter Brandt, otherwise a staunch believer in Bitcoin’s strength, proved even more pessimistic as he hinted at a possibility the cryptocurrency’s next move could take it down toward $70,000.

Mark Newton, a director, and strategist at Fundstrat, similarly forecasted a retracement down to $60,000, though, again, the Wall Street analyst and advisory firm maintains a bullish 2025 price target for Bitcoin as the famous Tom Lee set it as high as $250,000 . Benjamin Cowen, the founder and CEO of ITC, mirrored the downturn prediction as he speculated BTC might mirror Invesco QQQ Trust and, thus, experience a flash crash to $60,000. Finally, Ali Martinez, the on-chain expert who compiled the other analyst forecasts for Bitcoin’s next move, opined that a significant short-term downturn is possible as the cryptocurrency is trading below ‘its most significant’ support zone at $97,300 and there are no logical stops between the support level $93,806 and $70,000. Bitcoin likely to set new records in 2025 despite December headwinds Despite the gloomy musings, the long-term picture remains generally optimistic for Bitcoin. Along with the aforementioned Peter Brandt – who believes in a long-term rally above $130,000 – and Tom Lee – who forecasted a climb to $250,000 in 2025 – the personal finance author Robert Kiyosaki estimated a surge to $350,000 and the digital assets lobbyist Perianne Boring opened up a possibility for a Bitcoin rocketing above $800,000 .

This increase is primarily attributed to Bitcoin whales—large holders of the cryptocurrency—ramping up their use of these transactions to transfer funds discreetly. These whales are linked to spot Bitcoin ETFs, MicroStrategy, and various custodial wallets, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju highlighted in a December 26 post on X. About CoinJoin CoinJoin is a process that obscures the ownership of unspent transaction outputs by pooling inputs and outputs from multiple participants. This method allows for greater transactional privacy, which Young Ju argued is frequently employed by institutions to shield their activities, rather than being a tool primarily for illicit purposes. He pointed to Chainalysis data , which revealed that hacking-related Bitcoin losses amounted to $2.2 billion in 2024, representing just 0.5% of Bitcoin’s $377 billion in realized cap inflows. This undermines the narrative that CoinJoin is predominantly used for money laundering. Speculation on Unknown Bitcoin Whales In addition to publicly known institutions, Young Ju noted the presence of unidentified Bitcoin whales holding approximately 420,000 BTC—valued at over $40 billion. The origin of these holdings has sparked speculation across the crypto community. Some believe these whales could represent a nation-state discreetly amassing Bitcoin reserves, while others suggest it could involve sanctioned nations attempting to bypass restrictions. Russia, for example, recently passed legislation permitting foreign trade using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, fueling theories of state-level accumulation. However, the increasing use of CoinJoin has also drawn scrutiny from global law enforcement. In April, U.S. authorities arrested the founders of the privacy-centric Samourai Wallet and seized its operations . The Department of Justice alleged the wallet’s CoinJoin feature facilitated over $2 billion in illicit transactions, including $100 million linked to dark web markets like Silk Road and Hydra Market. Similarly, Dutch authorities targeted Tornado Cash , another privacy tool, detaining its creator Alexey Pertsev in 2022. Pertsev was later convicted of money laundering in May 2024, highlighting the regulatory risks associated with privacy-enhancing technologies in crypto. While CoinJoin offers major privacy benefits for legitimate users, its misuse continues to capture the attention of regulators worldwide.

MANTRA ( OM ) is now a part of Binance’s BNSOL Super Staking program, which has formally begun its third phase. Through this effort, users who possess or stake BNSOL can earn higher staking rewards through the OM APR Boost Airdrop. The program, which offers a total prize pool of 191,619.83 OM with daily payouts, will run from Jan. 1 to Feb. 1, 2025. Users can earn staking rewards while keeping liquidity by using BNSOL, a staking token for Solana ( SOL ). You might also like: Binance to launch BNSOL, expand staking opportunities on Solana BNSOL represents staked SOL and its associated rewards. When users stake their SOL tokens on Binance, they receive BNSOL, which is a liquid staking token that provides liquidity, allowing users to trade, borrow, or leverage their staked SOL across Binance products and DeFi platforms. This stands in contrast to traditional SOL staking, which locks assets. As 1 BNSOL represents 1 SOL plus accrued staking rewards, this innovation allows users to maximize their staking rewards without locking their assets. The BNSOL Super Staking program takes full advantage of the Solana blockchain’s high-performance features, including its scalability and fast transaction speeds. The SOL network is ideal for decentralized apps, and by staking SOL through Binance , users can tap into this robust infrastructure while enjoying liquidity. As staking rewards accumulate, the value of BNSOL increases, giving users the chance to earn greater profits.

The increased market share underscores Tron’s increasing traction within the stablecoin industry. The blockchain likely attracts participants due to its quicker processing times and cost-friendly transaction charges. Meanwhile, the maturing Tron ecosystem positions the native token TRX for remarkable growth in the coming months and years. TRX price outlook TRX traded at $0.2587 after gaining nearly 4% on its daily chart, with a 25% increase in daily trading volume (to $1.04 billion) showing impressive investor interest. Chart by Coinmarketcap Meanwhile, the recovery rally saw TRX surpassing the 200 Exponential Moving Average line at $0.25. Extended bullish actions would trigger surges toward the 52-week peak at $0.45. That would translate to a 74% gain from TRX’s current prices. Further, trend-based FIB levels reveal $0.54 as a potential target in January. Such uptrends amidst broad market optimism would likely open the path to the $1 psychological level. However, impressive buyer activity is essential for such rallies. Bearish reversals would catalyze price declines toward the significant support barrier at $0.2251.

38179751,https://crypto.news/?p=14322594,1735297457,Bitcoin in trouble? Analysts warn of potential pullback to $60k,"With Bitcoin trading close to $95k after two weeks of declining prices, analysts are wary of a potential massive crash that could see the flagship asset drop to $60k. Bitcoin has dropped over 2.5% over the last 24 hours, with an intraday low of $95,134 yesterday. The fall in price extended its fortnight losses to 3.7%, with the asset’s market cap falling to $1.9 billion. While bulls are striving to defend the critical $95,000 support level, on-chain data and market analysts suggest a significantly higher probability of Bitcoin’s price plummeting to $60,000 by Donald Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 19. Following Bitcoin’s recent drop near $95,000, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez, who boasts over 104.3k followers, noted in a recent X post that some savvy investors have already transferred over 33,000 BTC, valued at more than $3.23 billion, from their wallets to exchanges over the past week, likely anticipating a bearish scenario. Such a move typically occurs when investors grow cautious and prepare to sell their holdings, expecting a potential price drop or increased market volatility. Further investor profit-taking in BTC also surged on Dec. 23, with Bitcoin holders collectively realizing over $7.17 billion in profits on that day, the analyst added. Moreover, derivative traders appear less bullish on Bitcoin’s near-term price outlook. Notably, the percentage of traders taking long positions on the world’s largest cryptocurrency dropped from 66.73% to 53.6%. According to Martinez, the key support level for Bitcoin lies between $93,806 and $97,041 and a failure to hold this critical demand zone could result in Bitcoin’s price correcting to $70,085. You might also like: Matrixport outlines new risks that could challenge Bitcoin’s rally in 2025 Failure to hold $95k may spark deeper correction Some other crypto industry experts have similarly warned that a further decline in Bitcoin ‘s price below the critical $95,000 support level could trigger a significant drop, potentially pushing it as low as $60,000. Market commentator Tone Vays warned that if Bitcoin’s price falls below $95,000, it could signal trouble and set the stage for a sharp correction down to around $73,000. Peter Brandt, a veteran trader who famously predicted the Bitcoin crash in 2018, has also expressed concerns that Bitcoin might be on the verge of breaking down from a “broadening triangle” — a bearish signal in technical analysis — which could result in a drop to around $70,000. Meanwhile, Mark Newton, managing director at Fundstrat, and analyst Benjamin Cohen have both expressed concerns that Bitcoin’s price could fall to the $60,000 range in the short term. Cohen suggests that Bitcoin’s price might follow a similar pattern to other assets, such as the Invesco QQQ Trust, potentially experiencing a crash around significant political events, such as Donald Trump’s inauguration day on Jan. 19. The bullish case for Bitcoin Despite the bearish outlook, some analysts remain optimistic that Bitcoin’s fall may not be as hard as many are speculating. Georgii Verbitskii, founder of TYMIO, told crypto.news that he doesn’t anticipate any major downturns for Bitcoin in the short term. In the worst-case scenario, he expects the price might only drop to a low of $89,000, citing increased institutional activity in the market backing Bitcoin. “Typically, there isn’t much liquidity on the market during holidays. Today is the largest expiration of options, so market makers are creating the volatility they need. In the coming days, everything will most likely stabilize and we will witness smooth growth then.” Georgii Verbitskii, founder of TYMIO told crypto.news. Pseudonymous trader Titan of Crypto also anticipates a similar drop in Bitcoin’s price to $87,000 during the correction phase before the next upward move toward $110,000. Another prominent analyst observed that Bitcoin is currently completing the third Elliott Wave count, which is typically the largest wave. The analyst has set a target of $127,000 for Bitcoin. In its latest analysis report shared on X on Dec. 27, research firm Santiment revealed an encouraging trend following the post-Christmas market-wide dip, noting that crypto whales are dominating the crypto market as they are actively moving stablecoins to exchanges. While acknowledging that this doesn’t guarantee whales will deploy their capital immediately, the firm concluded, “Consider this a bullish sign as 2024 draws to a close.” At press time Bitcoin ( BTC ) was down 2.1%, trading at $96,464 per coin.

This development has been fueled by a recent post by Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie), a well-known crypto influencer on X. She shared a screenshot of SBI’s English presentation and suggested that Japanese banks will begin using XRP in one week. ONLY 1 MORE WEEK TO GO UNTIL EVERY BANK IN JAPAN WILL USE #XRP – ACCORDING TO THE SBI CEO YOSHITAKA KITAO! Source: https://t.co/0eNXALc1MH pic.twitter.com/deJnSNRsZ7 — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) December 25, 2024 SBI’s Remittance System The screenshot shared by Amelie shows some details of a proposed Remittance system for XRP. It involves the XRP Ledger and Ripple’s Interledger Protocol (ILP) which the Bank of England has also shown interest in . The image shows how Japanese banks can connect to international financial institutions through ILP and also communicate among themselves with the same technology. This allows the transfer of value and remittance payments without the need to process multiple currencies, as all transactions can be processed using XRP as a bridge currency. SBI and Ripple’s Partnership SBI Group has been a strong advocate for XRP and its underlying technology. The updated English presentation shared some key details of this partnership. SBI invested in Ripple Labs in 2016, becoming the largest external shareholder, and this partnership has led to the development of innovative remittance solutions utilizing XRP as a bridge currency. In 2021, SBI Remit launched Japan’s first international remittance service leveraging XRP, streamlining cross-border transactions and demonstrating the technology’s real-world applications. In late 2023, the company expanded its remittance services to The Philippines, Vietnam, and Indonesia, using XRP as a bridge currency. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The potential widespread adoption of XRP by Japanese banks would be a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency market. It would validate the technology’s utility for real-world financial transactions and solidify its position as a viable solution for international payments. SBI Group’s commitment to XRP extends beyond remittance services. The company plans to leverage the XRP Ledger for other financial applications, such as issuing non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This diversification of use cases demonstrates the growing recognition of XRP’s potential to revolutionize various aspects of the financial industry. Japan has been progressive in its approach to crypto regulation , and further regulatory clarity and a supportive regulatory framework will be essential to ensure the sustainable growth and adoption of XRP and other cryptocurrencies in the country. Although Amelie did not specify her source for the one-week adoption timeline, XRP’s unique features, such as its speed and low transaction costs, make it an attractive option for banks seeking to improve efficiency and reduce costs associated with cross-border payments.

A lack of a basic regulatory framework for exchanges and trading of cryptocurrencies is the predominant reason why many still feel reluctance in spending on this asset class, as per Kristin Smith – the chief executive of Blockchain Association. “If these were regulated markets like people are used to having with financial assets, I think people would be more open to coming into Bitcoin,” she argued in a recent interview with CNBC . That’s essentially what she expects could change under the new government – and other cryptocurrencies, including the promising iDEGEN could, therefore, benefit in 2025. iDEGEN is a play on the continued strength of Bitcoin Bitcoin has pulled back in recent sessions as the post-election rally calmed down a little, but Kristin Smith remains convinced that it’s eventually headed for $200,000. That’s because retail financial advisors have now started to recommend that clients secure at least some exposure to the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap. BlackRock, for example, sees 2.0% as a “reasonable range” for Bitcoin allocation. Smith is not sure if the US will immediately opt for a strategic Bitcoin reserve under the Trump administration, but a few of the states as well as some countries already have. That may help Bitcoin continue to make new highs in 2025, she added. Against such a backdrop, investing in iDEGEN is an exciting proposition considering it doesn’t only expose you to benefit from the aforementioned strength in the crypto industry, but it exposes you to another fast-growing market, artificial intelligence, as well. Click here to learn more about iDEGEN now. iDEGEN presale is firing on all cylinders iDEGEN is an AI-enabled meme coin that has raised well over $9.0 million in a month of presale. The token’s price is based entirely on demand and has risen from $0.045 at the start of presale to $0.173 at writing. That translates to about a 300% upside already, which suggests iDEGEN has garnered solid popularity among crypto enthusiasts. So, as the US Federal Reserve continues to lower its key interest rate in the coming year and make the risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies seemingly more attractive for investment, more capital could flow into iDEGEN and push its price further up in 2025. Finally, the AI-based meme coin could attract a lot more demand as it goes live on a crypto exchange next year following the ongoing presale. Combined with the expected upside in Bitcoin, these factors could help iDEGEN prove to be a lucrative investment for 2025.

This isn’t like any typical BTC ETF which works with direct exposure. Instead, it targets companies with massive Bitcoin holdings. The fund will invest in firms holding over 1,000 BTC in their treasuries and will prioritize Bitcoin value over market cap. The ETF proposal comes at the end of a year that Bitcoin soared by 117%, crossing six figures for the first time in November. BTC went on to hit its peak at $108K earlier in December. Public companies have ridden the crypto wave to boost their stock prices, with MicroStrategy making the most of the surge. Bitwise targets Bitcoin giants Nate Geraci, President at ETF Store, in a post announced that Bitwise filed for a Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF. He added that the “BTC treasury operations virus is spreading.” The firms are expected to hold 1,000 BTC in their treasuries, have at least a $100 million market cap, $1 million daily liquidity, and less than 10% public float. The weighting formula is unique as it’s based on the market value of a company’s Bitcoin holdings , capped at 25% per firm. Companies like MicroStrategy (444,262 BTC) could dominate the ETF over giants like Tesla (9,720 BTC), despite having smaller market caps. However, Bitwise isn’t the only innovator. On the same day, Strive (founded by Vivek Ramaswamy) filed for a Bitcoin Bonds ETF. This fund will focus on convertible bonds from Bitcoin-heavy corporates like MicroStrategy . Public companies are bullish on Bitcoin. They now see BTC as more than just an asset in the market; it has become a strategy. On December 16, KULR Technology Group bought 217 BTC for $21M. This move resulted in a 40% stock price jump, closing at an all-time high of $4.80. Bitcoin rally fizzling out Bitcoin’s rally stalled after a record-breaking year. As 2024 wraps up, Bitcoin price is hovering around the $96,000 – $97,000 zone. The ongoing rally started after President-elect Trump’s promise of a crypto-friendly US and a national Bitcoin reserve. While the buzz initially drove prices up, traders are now cashing in profits and waiting to see if these plans materialize. Friday will mark the expiry of a huge amount of BTC and ETH options contracts. More than $14 billion in BTC and $3.8 billion in ETH options are set to expire on Deribit alone. This could mean a choppy market as traders close positions. It is expected that MicroStrategy might expand its buying spree. The firm already owns over $40 billion in BTC, turning itself into a Bitcoin accumulation machine. Despite this, Bitcoin could end December in the red and this would be the first monthly loss in four months. After hitting a record $108,316 on December 17, BTC has pulled back as investors weigh risks and take profits.

Stephen Akridge, co-founder of Solana Labs, is being sued in San Francisco court by his ex-wife, Elisa Rossi, who claims he withheld “millions of dollars” worth of crypto accumulated in staking rewards from Solana ( SOL ) tokens. According to Rossi, Akridge gave her control of three crypto wallets as part of their divorce agreement, per court documents first reported by Law.com. However, Akridge allegedly kept the staking rewards for himself by directing SOL tokens to addresses under his control. Rossi says she discovered this two months after the divorce was finalized in March. “ unbeknownst to Ms. Rossi, Mr. Akridge took advantage of the significant disparity in expertise in cryptocurrencies and blockchain that he possessed as the co-founder of Solana and merely gave Ms. Rossi’s Solana wallet authority over three accounts that contained the Solana tokens.” Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough You might also like: Sonic SVM partners Solayer, Adrastea to expand Solana restaking Rossi claims that when she asked for the rewards, Akridge refused, even mocking her and saying, “Good luck getting those staking rewards from me,” the report reads. The case includes claims of fraud, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment. Rossi seeks an order from the court for actual and compensatory damages, the amount to be determined at trial. She is also requesting punitive or statutory exemplary damages, as well as pre-judgment and post-judgment interest at the maximum legal rate.

The cryptocurrency is down just over 2% over the past 24 hours, trading around the $96,100 mark with sellers firmly in control. BTC’s downside comes despite low trading volume over the Christmas holidays, with traders wondering if the markets will see the traditional year-end rally this year. Almost all cryptocurrencies were in the red on Boxing Day as bearish sentiment dominated the market. Ethereum (ETH) is down nearly 2%, continuing its slide towards $3,000. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) is down just over 4%, and Solana (SOL) is down by 3.21%. Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) , Toncoin (TON), Hedera (HBAR), Stellar (XLM) , and Polkadot (DOT) also reported significant losses. 2024 Was The Year Of Crypto Crypto got pretty much everything it wanted in 2024. Once relegated to the fringes, digital assets are now part of the mainstream and can be traded and owned by regular Americans. Wall Street and major financial institutions are hailing crypto as a wise investment, with the incoming Trump administration promising legislative support to the industry. Crypto’s growing acceptance has led to significant gains for investors. Bitcoin (BTC) holders have reported gains of over 120% since the beginning of the year as the world’s largest cryptocurrency broke past the $100,000 barrier following Donald Trump’s election victory. Analysts and enthusiasts don’t see the crypto rally ending anytime soon, with Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan expecting BTC to cross $200,000 before the end of 2025. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who once called himself a proud skeptic of Bitcoin, has now become one of its biggest advocates. “I was a proud skeptic, and I studied it, learned about it, and came away saying, 'OK, you know, my opinion [for] five years was wrong. We believe bitcoin is an asset class in itself; it is an alternative to other commodities like gold.” BlackRock and other prominent money managers, including Franklin Templeton and Fidelity Investments, launched spot Bitcoin ETFs, allowing everyday traders to gain exposure to BTC without owning the asset. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF became the fastest-growing ETF in history, and 11 other ETFs amassed over $100 billion in assets under management. Robbie Mitchnick, BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, stated, “You had folks who would have been allocating to Bitcoin, but because there was no traditionally trusted, easy, efficient way to do it for their circumstances, they weren't in it. And then the ETFs changed that.” What The Crypto Industry Wants From Trump The crypto industry put its full weight behind Donald Trump’s election campaign. Now, it is readying a list of demands for the incoming administration. The crypto industry faced a significant lack of clarity from federal regulators, leaving it frustrated. The frustration increased thanks to the Biden administration’s stance against crypto. The outgoing administration took a hawkish stance against crypto and went after industry giants, including Coinbase and Ripple, accusing them of selling unregistered securities. However, President-elect Donald Trump, who once blasted crypto and called it a scam, fully embraced it on the campaign trail and became one of the first presidential candidates to accept digital assets. Kristin Smith, the CEO of the Blockchain Association, stated, “With a bipartisan, pro-crypto Congress and pro-crypto president next year, the pieces are in place to get smart policy — including stablecoin and market structure legislation — across the finish line that will shape the American crypto industry for years to come. Looking ahead to 2025, the industry must work together on these policy solutions, presenting a cohesive vision to our leaders in Washington. Political power is fleeting, so we must take advantage of this moment to ensure crypto has a bright future ahead in the United States.” South Korea Imposes Sanctions Against North Koreans For Crypto Heist North Korean hackers are on the radars of governments, blaming them for significant crypto heists in 2024. Hackers associated with the infamous Lazarus Group are suspected to be behind some of the biggest cyber hacks in Web3 and crypto, including the $600 million Ronin hack. South Korea has become the latest country to impose sanctions on hacker groups from North Korea. It recently imposed sanctions against 15 North Korean IT organization members and one related group. The sanctioned entities have allegedly procured funds for North Korea’s nuclear missile development program and the DPRK’s Munitions Industry Department. The 313th General Bureau’s Kim Cheol-Min is among the sanctioned individuals who earned a significant amount of cryptocurrency while working undercover for United States and Canadian companies before delivering the stolen funds to North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) ’s post-Christmas rally looks all but snuffed out after the cryptocurrency declined swiftly, failing to retake the $100,000 mark. As a result, BTC plummeted to a low of $95,171 before staging a marginal recovery and moving to its current level. The crypto market has seen very low trading volumes over the Christmas period. We must also remember that BTC has more than doubled year-to-date. However, the declines over the past week could indicate that the tailwind of lower interest rates could have become a headwind. Additionally, markets were also spooked by an inaccurate chart, which sent traders into a frenzy and a mini selloff. BTC is trading between $95,000 as it looks to build momentum and prevent a further decline. BTC set a new all-time high on Tuesday as it rallied to $108,268 before registering a marginal decline and settling at $106,142. BTC lost momentum after surging above $108,000, declining considerably on Wednesday, dropping almost 6% to $100,195. Bearish sentiment persisted on Thursday as BTC dropped by 2.49%, going below the 20-day SMA and $100,000 to settle at $97,703. Selling pressure intensified considerably on Friday as BTC dropped to an intraday low of $92,072. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal recovery and settle at $98,124. Source: TradingView Sellers returned over the weekend as BTC dropped by 0.63% on Saturday and settled at $97,505. Sunday saw sellers tighten their grip on the market as the price dropped by 2.26% and settled at $95,303. BTC experienced volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers attempted to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC registered a marginal drop and settled at $94,830. Buyers returned to the market on Tuesday, and BTC registered an increase of just over 4% and settled at $98,677. It attempted to go above $100,000 on Wednesday but could only reach $99,409, thanks to the 20-day SMA acting as resistance. As a result of growing selling pressure at $100,000, BTC dropped significantly on Thursday, dropping almost 4% to $95,561. The current session sees BTC marginally down as buyers struggle to build momentum. If sellers can push BTC below $95,000, it could drop to $92,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) is struggling to reclaim $3,500 after facing a significant drop on Boxing Day. ETH lost momentum after reaching $4,100 last Monday and dropped by 2.33%, slipping below $4,000 on Tuesday. Bearish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as ETH dipped below the 20-day SMA after falling almost 7% and settling at $3,625. Buyers attempted a recovery on Thursday as ETH rose to $3,762. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped almost 6% to $3,415. Sellers dragged ETH to an intraday low of $3,096 on Friday. However, ETH recovered from this level to register an increase of 1.62% and settle at $3,470. Source: TradingView Unfortunately, the weekend saw ETH back in the red as it dropped almost 4% on Saturday to go below the 50-day SMA and settle at $3,337. Sellers retained control on Sunday as ETH dropped nearly 2% and settled at $3,279. ETH started the current week positively, rising 4.27% and moving to $3,419. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as ETH crossed the 50-day SMA and settled at $3,491, close to the $3,500 resistance. With sellers active at this level, ETH could only register a marginal increase on Wednesday. Sellers took control on Thursday as ETH plummeted almost 5% after failing to go above $3,500 and settled at $3,333. The current session sees ETH marginally up as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. If sellers continue to control the session, ETH could drop to $3,200. If this level is breached it could decline to $3,000 before recovering. On the other hand, if buyers retake control, ETH could attempt to reclaim the $3,500 level. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) attempted to go above the 20-day SMA last week, rising to an intraday high of $228 before settling at $223 on Tuesday. However, sentiment changed on Wednesday as SOL dropped below the 50-day SMA, falling 7.50% to $206. Sellers drove SOL below $200 on Thursday, falling to $193 after a drop of just over 6%. Friday saw SOL experience significant volatility as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. As a result, SOL dropped to an intraday low of $175 and rose to an intraday high of $199 before settling at $194. Source: TradingView Sellers were back in control on Saturday as SOL dropped almost 7% and settled at $181. The price remained in the red on Sunday dropping marginally to $180.

However, with sellers active at this level, SOL could only register a marginal increase on Wednesday before registering a drop of 4.56% on Thursday to settle at $188. The current session sees SOL up almost 1% and trading around $189. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Analysis Dogecoin (DOGE) has struggled to reverse bearish sentiment since reaching an intraday high of $0.467 on December 8. After dropping below the 20-day SMA, sellers drove DOGE below the 50-day SMA last week, as it fell over 12% on Thursday and settled at $0.317. Selling pressure intensified considerably on Friday as DOGE dropped to a low of $0.262. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $0.317. Buyers attempted a recovery on Friday as DOGE rose to an intraday high of $0.350. However, they lost momentum after reaching this level, and DOGE dropped to $0.319, registering only a marginal increase. However, DOGE was back in the red on Sunday, falling 2.47% to $0.310, ending the weekend on a bearish note. Source: TradingView The current week began with DOGE registering an increase of 4.20% to settle at $0.325. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as DOGE rose almost 4% to $0.337.

The current session sees DOGE marginally up and trading around $0.315.

The current session sees XRP marginally up and trading around the $2.16 mark. Uniswap (UNI) Price Analysis Uniswap (UNI) dipped below the 20-day SMA on Wednesday after dropping almost 9% to settle at $14.80.

38179820,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631408,1735297200,"Dogecoin Price Gaining Another 179% in December Is Unlikely, But This DOGE Alternative Under $0.003 Will Hit $15 in the Next 3 Months","The rise of memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) has always been fueled by their potential for rapid, explosive gains. But as analysts grow doubtful of DOGE achieving another 179% price surge by December, investors are shifting their focus to a promising alternative Lightchain AI (LCAI). Currently priced under $0.003, LCAI is gaining momentum thanks to its innovative fusion of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI). With experts forecasting it could reach $15 in the next three months, excitement around the project is building. Don’t miss out on the Lightchain AI Presale, where early adopters can secure LCAI at ground-floor pricing—learn more here. Let’s dive into what makes LCAI stand out and why its growth potential is leaving DOGE in the dust. Why Dogecoin’s 179% December Rally Is Unlikely Dogecoin owes a lot of its old wins to the b͏uzz from people and media focus. While DOGE’s strong fans still stay, getting another 179% price leap by December faces big problems. Market full is a main problem, as the growth of many memecoins has made tough race for investor notice. Also, DOGE does not have tech newness, with its worth depending much on feeling instead of real-world use, which holds back its chance for big short-term gains. Also, big market ways have changed as the crypto space grows, with buyers more and more liking projects that give real uses over tokens that only rely on buzz. Without a strong reason, DOGE’s odds for another huge rise in December seem not likely. Enter Lightchain AI (LCAI) DOGE Alternative With Real Utility Lightchain AI flips the memecoin narrative by offering something far more substantial than community enthusiasm. By integrating AI technology into its blockchain architecture, LCAI opens the door to a wide range of AI-driven decentralized applications (dApps). Key Features of LCAI Include Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) AIVM enables developers to deploy AI-powered dApps that deliver solutions across finance, healthcare, logistics, and more—far beyond the simplistic use cases of typical meme tokens. Proof of Intelligence (PoI) Instead of just staking or mining, PoI rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations. This ensures that the network generates tangible benefits, making it both efficient and meaningful. Deflationary Tokenomics LCAI burns a portion of transaction fees, ensuring long-term scarcity and helping drive sustained price appreciation. In contrast to DOGE, whose growth potential is driven almost entirely by social media buzz, LCAI boasts a tech-driven value proposition that has the potential to deliver long-term sustainable gains. Why LCAI Could Hit $15 in 3 Months At its current presale price of $0.003, LCAI offers unprecedented upside potential. Even a moderate rise to $0.15 would deliver 50x gains—but analysts believe it could climb as high as $15 in the next three months due to Early-Stage Growth Advantage With a low starting price, incremental progress—such as achieving testnet milestones or integrating AI-driven solutions—can yield exponential returns. Market Demand for AI Integration AI adoption is accelerating across industries. A blockchain platform that facilitates AI computations could quickly become indispensable, attracting both retail and institutional capital. Strategic Partnerships and Developer Adoption As LCAI’s ecosystem expands, forging partnerships with enterprises and AI solution providers could catapult its token value upward, far surpassing what DOGE can achieve in the same timeframe. Comparing DOGE and LCAI Beyond Meme Status While Dogecoin carved out its place in crypto history, its future gains hinge more on sentiment than on substance. Lightchain AI, by contrast, offers a compelling narrative built on innovation and utility. Feature Dogecoin (DOGE) Lightchain AI (LCAI) Core Value Proposition Meme-driven hype AI integration in blockchain Utility Limited (tipping, sentiment) Broad, real-world use cases Tokenomics Inflationary Deflationary Growth Potential Moderate, sentiment-based High (projected $15 in 3 months) Seizing Next Big Opportunity While Dogecoin struggles to find a catalyst that would spur another triple-digit gain, Lightchain AI (LCAI) offers a fresh story grounded in real-world utility and groundbreaking technology. With analysts predicting a surge to $15 in just three months, LCAI presents a rare, high-upside investment opportunity. For investors who missed DOGE’s meteoric rise or are tired of chasing hype-driven tokens, LCAI offers a smarter path—combining innovation, scarcity, and AI-powered functionality that aligns perfectly with the crypto market’s evolving priorities. If you’re looking for a strong growth story and a solid project with room for sustained appreciation, LCAI is the way to go.

38179556,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376392,1735297076,Top Ripple (XRP) Price Predictions as of Late,"TL;DR XRP recovered to $2.18 after dropping below $2 last week, with analysts predicting a potential rally. While some foresee the asset reaching $100 in the future, achieving this would require an unrealistic market cap exceeding $5 trillion. XRP Rally Incoming? The cryptocurrency market correction, which started last week, negatively affected numerous leading digital assets. Ripple’s XRP is one of those, with its price plunging from $2.70 on December 17 to under $2 a few days later. Recently, the bulls recovered some lost ground, pushing the asset’s valuation to the current $2.18. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Despite the fluctuations, multiple analysts on crypto X continue to predict new peaks for XRP in the short term. Mikybull Crypto, for instance, claimed that XRP’s chart “is looking spicy on its current retest,” expecting a rise to a new all-time high of $4. For their part, EGRAG CRYPTO presented two possible scenarios. The analyst assumed XRP could head toward lower targets if it tumbled below $2. On the other hand, breaking above $2.65 could mean that “fireworks will ignite.” The X user with moniker Coach, JV also chipped in. Several days ago, they claimed that XRP would be one of those cryptocurrencies that investors will regret not buying now: “XRP will be one of these assets where people will say, “I could have bought XRP at $2, $5, or $7, and will FOMO in at $100.” The beauty in this. Everyone will win in the long run! It’s the short-term mindset that destroys portfolios!” It is important to note that reaching a whopping target of $100 will require XRP’s market cap to skyrocket above $5 trillion. As of this writing, the entire capitalization of the crypto sector is less than $3.5 trillion, making the forecast quite unplausible (to say the least). Previous Predictions Other industry participants who weighed in recently include the X users Crypto Bitlord and CrediBULL Crypto. The former believes “the final pump for 2024 is loading,” speculating that the price might rally to as high as $12 next month. CrediBULL Crypto told his 450,000 followers on X that “the XRP/BTC chart looks absolutely fantastic” and “the most bullish-looking chart in the entire space.” As such, the analyst said they will look to open a long position in the coming days .

On November 6, Bitcoin broke its mid-March peak of $73,000, and by December 5, it reached $100,000. Since Donald Trump’s election victory on November 5, the BTC market has grown by at least 41.75%. MicroStrategy’s Dominance MicroStrategy, the public company with the largest Bitcoin holdings, has seen an impressive surge of nearly 52.86% in value. Michael J. Saylor, co-founder of MicroStrategy, has highlighted the company’s growth due to its innovative Bitcoin acquisition strategy. He has even called on other tech giants, particularly Microsoft, to follow suit in adopting Bitcoin. Prediction markets now predict a high probability that at least one of the Magnificent Seven companies will adopt Bitcoin in 2025. This brings us to a fascinating question: Which public companies hold more than 1,000 BTC? Here’s a list of the top ten public companies with over 1,000 BTC: Company Name Number of Bitcoins MicroStrategy 444,262 Marathon Digital Holdings 40,435 Riot Platforms 16,728 Hut 8 Corp 10,096 Tesla 9,720 CleanSpark 9,297 Coinbase 9,000 Block 8,211 Galaxy Digital Holdings 8,100 Bitcoin Group SE 3,830 MicroStrategy: The Bitcoin King MicroStrategy, founded in 1989 by Michael J.

Price Skyrocketed!,"While the popularity of memecoins in the cryptocurrency market is increasing day by day, an incredible event took place. Accordingly, Siqi Chen, the founder of the startup platform Runaway, shared his daughter Mira's struggle with a rare brain tumor and became a hot topic with the events that followed. After Siqi Chin appealed for help for her daughter, a memecoin called MIRA was created on the Pump.Fun platform. MIRA, which started as a memecoin supporting research on rare brain tumors in children, quickly reached a market cap of $80 million. 50% of the supply was purchased by an X user “Waddles eth” and transferred to Chen’s project wallet. This support allowed the memecoin called MIRA to reach its peak price yesterday. Despite a subsequent 80% drop from its peak, MIRA managed to raise over $1 million for brain tumor research. Chen also asked for donations to the Hankinson Laboratory at the University of Colorado, which is the only place in North America conducting research on a rare brain tumor in children. Surprised by the overwhelming response to his calls for help, Chen said in a post on his X account that this was his most unforgettable day on the internet in 30 years. Chen also said he would sell $1,000 worth of MIRA every 10 minutes to keep funding flowing to the Hankinson Lab at the University of Colorado. uh so some random guy 20 minutes made a SOL memecoin called $MIRA to help with research fundraising and sent me half the entire supply and it's now worth like $400K and i literally don't know what to do because i certainly don't want to rug a bunch of random people https://t.co/P78bLq52fB — Siqi Chen (@blader) December 26, 2024 *This is not investment advice.

As the $BTC price moves into the first quarter of 2025, could this be the beginning of the final blow-off stage which takes Bitcoin much, much higher? The last candle flame of 2024 is guttering, about to be extinguished as the bright new flame of 2025 is about to be lit. Entering into this strong new light, the price of Bitcoin has the tailwinds behind it which could send it to unimaginable heights in the coming new year. Bitcoin’s path from despair to the hope of a very bright future From the depths of despair, when an incredibly anti-Bitcoin administration sought to strangle the king of the cryptocurrencies, along with the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem; to an incoming Trump administration that has vowed to support and encourage the growth of Bitcoin and crypto in the US; this unfolding story of cutting-edge technical innovation has been fascinating to watch. Operation Chokepoint 2.0 is officially over. Gary Gensler, Chairman of the SEC, has said that he will step down the day before Donald Trump is inaugurated for his second term of President. With Trump’s administration full of pro-crypto members in several key positions, the future looks very bright. Institutions are onboard The institutions are now on board as far as Bitcoin is concerned, with Blackrock, the biggest asset management company in the world, buying BTC for its institutional clients at the most frantic pace. This has made the Spot Bitcoin ETFs the most successful ever in the history of ETF launches. Add to this the gargantuan Bitcoin buying spree of MicroStrategy, which has been copied by a growing number of companies that are boosting their stock price by cramming more and more BTC into their treasuries, and you have a huge pile of dynamite just ready to explode. $BTC follows sideways price action over last few weeks Source: TradingView The daily chart for $BTC shows that the price has definitively left the ascending channel, and now appears to be following the bottom trendline of this channel, perhaps to fall back to around $90,000 which is the measured move for this breakdown. That said, if one looks at the $BTC price over the last few weeks, it can be seen that it has generally traversed sideways, with one spike in mid-December that took $BTC to the all-time high of around $108,000. Currently, the price is traversing above horizontal support at $95,600. Horizontal resistance has formed above this at $100,000, and the price is moving inside this range. RSI downtrend has to be reversed Source: TradingView In the weekly time frame it can be seen that the current price is above the long-time ascending trendline from 2021. Several candle wicks to the downside show how Bitcoin bulls are keeping the price buoyant. It might be imagined that once this consolidation is over, there could be some explosive price action that takes $BTC to the next level. At the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index is signalling a possible tick back to the upside. The red arrow points to the indicator starting to turn back up after the recent dip. If this is confirmed at the weekly close, it will be important to watch to see if this indicator line can retest the ascending trendline. In fact, in order to avoid bearish divergence, as price increases while the RSI decreases, the indicator line will have to pierce through the descending trendline, and make a higher high in order to reverse the downtrend. Failure to do so could result in the end of this bull market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT.

XRP and the local currency, the Korean won (KRW), have experienced notable drops in market value amid the impeachment of acting President Han Duck-soo. Investors are now worried that market reactions will reverberate far beyond the country’s borders. As news of Han’s impeachment unfolded, South Korean crypto markets took a hit. XRP, the world’s fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, saw its value drop by more than 3% over the course of a tumultuous week. South Korea’s won also followed a similar trend, falling to its lowest level in nearly 16 years. It has dipped further than the 1,480 per dollar mark. US dollar against the won: Source: Tradingeconomics.com The sell-off in XRP and other digital assets has fueled concerns about broader market volatility. The economic instability in South Korea, compounded by the political crisis, has sparked fears that more disruptions could be on the horizon for the crypto market. South Korea’s political turmoil and economic fallout South Korea is one of the largest cryptocurrency trading markets, and the turbulence surrounding Han’s impeachment and the country’s currency has had direct consequences for its digital asset sector. The political chaos, sparked by Yoon’s controversial martial law declaration on December 3, led to an economic fallout that reflected in a sharp drop in business morale. According to a Trading Economics insight, the index for business sentiment plummeted to 62 in December, the lowest point since July 2020. XRP, along with other major cryptocurrencies, has seen fluctuations in value as South Korean investors, who represent a substantial portion of the global trading volume, react to the political crisis. In the early hours of Friday, Ripple’s native token hit a seven-day low against the won, dropping to values slightly below 3,200 before retracing back above 3,300. At press time, XRP is changing hands around the 3,100 to 3,350 won on Upbit. XRP trading in South Korea – Source: Upbit Data from TradingView charts also show that Upbit , the largest digital currency trading platform in South Korea, saw a 40% downtick in trading volume over the last day. The market stance scale has been neutral for weeks now, which could mean that investors are uncertain whether to accumulate or sell. Still, XRP remains the most popular crypto in the country, with its daily trading volume almost doubling that of Bitcoin, the largest crypto by market cap globally, according to Coingecko data . In an attempt to calm the storm, Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok held an emergency meeting with the Governor of the Bank of Korea and promised “decisive” measures to stabilize the market. However, these interventions have yet to quell the concerns surrounding South Korea’s financial future. As political instability continues to unfold, market volatility is expected to remain high, putting pressure on both local and international investors. Han’s impeachment and its political context South Korea’s National Assembly voted on Friday to impeach acting President Han Duck-soo. This is the second head of state to be ousted this month following President Yoon Suk-yeol’s impeachment. This latest political upheaval comes just two weeks after Yoon’s removal from office, triggered by his controversial imposition of martial law earlier in December. On December 3, President Yoon declared martial law for six hours, the first such decree since the 1979 military coup. Yoon justified the move as necessary to “protect the constitutional order” and counter what he described as anti-state groups and pro-North Korea forces threatening the nation’s stability, per an NBC News report . Han’s impeachment was initiated by opposition lawmakers who criticized the acting president’s refusal to immediately appoint three justices to the Constitutional Court. These appointments enables the court to decide whether to uphold Yoon’s impeachment or reinstate him to office. The ruling People Power Party, which Han belongs to, argued that filling these vacancies goes beyond the scope of Han’s duties as acting president. The impeachment vote saw 192 lawmakers voting in favor, far surpassing the 151 votes needed for approval. This marked the first time in South Korea’s history that an acting president had faced such a motion. In response, lawmakers from Han’s ruling People Power Party (PPP) protested the process, with some even boycotting the vote . Han’s suspension is now imminent, but his position remains uncertain pending the Constitutional Court’s decision, which could take up to 180 days. Meanwhile, Finance Minister Choi has stepped in as the country’s interim leader.

The inflows followed outflows totaling $1.52 billion between December 19 and December 24, which included a record $188.7 million single-day outflow for BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) on December 24. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund led the recovery with $254.4 million in inflows, while ARK 21Shares’ Bitcoin ETF added $186.9 million. More Funds See Inflows BlackRock’s IBIT contributed $56.5 million, with Grayscale’s mini Bitcoin ETF and VanEck’s ETF recording smaller gains of $7.2 million and $2.7 million, respectively. The resurgence comes as Bitcoin’s price slipped 2.2% over the past 24 hours, falling below $97,000. While Bitcoin ETFs regained momentum, Ether ETFs marked their third consecutive day of net inflows, totaling $301.6 million over that period. On December 26, Ether ETFs saw $117.2 million in net inflows, led by Fidelity’s ETF with $83 million, followed by BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF at $28.2 million and Grayscale’s ETH trust with $6 million. Ether, however, lagged behind Bitcoin, dropping 1.7% to under $3,400 and failing to reach a new all-time high in recent months. In their inaugural year, Bitcoin ETFs have seen significant activity, with total net inflows reaching $35.9 billion and total assets under management (AUM) at $111.9 billion. Ether ETFs, while newer to the market, have recorded $2.63 billion in net inflows and an AUM of $12 billion. On December 26, Bitcoin Spot ETFs recorded net inflows of $475.2 million, while Ethereum ETFs saw inflows of $112.2 million. pic.twitter.com/Ip1hBN6Pl6 — Crypto Crib (@Crypto_Crib_) December 27, 2024 Notably, the inflows came as Strive, an asset management firm founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, has filed with U.S. regulators to launch an ETF aimed at investing in Bitcoin-linked convertible bonds. Bitwise has also filed to launch the Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF, which will focus on publicly traded companies holding significant Bitcoin reserves. Digital Asset Investment Products Saw $308M Inflows Last Week Digital asset investment products experienced net inflows of $308 million last week, though this figure conceals a significant single-day outflow of $576 million on December 19. The week ended with a total outflow of $1 billion over its final two days, triggered largely by market reactions to the Federal Reserve’s hawkish dot plot announcement. These movements led to a $17.7 billion reduction in total assets under management (AuM) for digital asset ETPs, marking a 0.37% decline in AuM, according to a report from CoinShares . While concerning, this outflow is modest compared to the largest single-day outflow of 2.3% in mid-2022, which followed an FOMC interest rate hike.

In an announcement , the Jupiter team revealed it would be expanding its Jupuary token distribution in 2025. The first airdrop in January will see 700 million JUP distributed to users. Specifically, the upcoming airdrop will be split between exchange users and stakers on one hand and key DEX contributors dubbed “Carrots and Good Cats”. A snapshot for this distribution has already been taken, with the team noting that the approach above is aimed at appreciating “everyone in the Jupiverse.” Jupiter Uplink @jup_uplink · Follow Jupuary 2025 🪐Here is the first Overview of the upcoming Jupuary distribution.Team decided to go with a split between Users & Stakers and Carrots & Good Cats.

Note: This is a Draft, Subject to change 💡 9:47 pm · 26 Dec 2024 4.9K Reply Copy link Read 417 replies Jupiter’s JUP airdrop details Per a draft overview of the planned airdrop, 500 million JUP will go to users and stakers. Carrots and Good Cats have an allocation of 200 million tokens. The distribution allocations are only in draft mode, the Jupiter team noted, with any changes likely to follow if the community determines so. However, the initial plan is to airdrop 425 million JUP tokens to users and 75 million JUP to stakers. Meanwhile, Jupiter is looking to adopt a variable distribution mode for the 200 million JUP tokens set for the Carrots and Good Cats group. The initial plan is to distribute between 50 and 200 JUP tokens per wallet for “Carrots”, and use an application-based approach for the other group. “If you are using any Jupiter products, you will be eligible if you hit the minimum threshold,” the Jupiter team noted. 2.3 million eligible wallets According to details in the draft overview, there are a total of over 2.3 million eligible wallets based on the snapshot. Of the over 10 million wallets for swap users, about 2 million have hit the eligibility threshold of at least $1,000 in swap volume. There are also over 650,000 expert trader wallets, about 320,000 of which hit the minimum activity threshold to qualify for the distribution. Expert traders are those that used Perps, dollar cost averaging (DCA) and Limit orders among others during the snapshot period. Going by this allocation proposal, about 1.9 million wallets with an estimated eligible minimum swap volume of $800 will receive 50 JUP tokens each. There are also approximately 400k wallets with $29,000 in volume that will receive at least 250 tokens each. Meanwhile, 1k wallets are set to receive the largest allocation of about 20,000 JUP per wallet having met the minimum threshold of $14 million in swap volume. Jupiter’s circulating supply stood at 1.35 billion JUP tokens, with the maximum supply at 10 billion. In August, the community approved plans to reduce this to 7 billion via burning. JUP price hovered around $0.85 on Dec. 27, about 3% up in 24 hours.

How Much Inflow Was There? Here Are the Details,"According to the latest data, the crypto spot ETF market has witnessed a significant revival. Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs have seen significant net inflows after several days of withdrawals. Bitcoin, Ethereum Spot ETFs See Strong Inflows After Days of Outflows Bitcoin Spot ETFs: Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a net inflow of $475 million, marking the first positive move after four consecutive days of outflows. Fidelity’s FBTC alone accounted for $254 million of the total inflow. Ethereum Spot ETFs: Ethereum spot ETFs also saw strong inflows on the same day, with a total of $117 million recorded. Fidelity’s FETH led the way with $82.96 million in Ethereum inflows, followed by BlackRock’s ETHA, which brought in $28.17 million. The inflows reflect renewed investor confidence in cryptocurrency ETFs, which provide regulated exposure to digital assets without the complexity of direct ownership. This resurgence comes after a period of increased market volatility and suggests that institutional and retail interest in crypto investment products remains strong. As Bitcoin and Ethereum continue their dominance in the cryptocurrency market, these inflows highlight the growing appeal of spot ETFs as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset space. *This is not investment advice.

38179003,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633814,1735295435,Bitcoin set to finish an outstanding year steep in the red,"Bitcoin is sliding into the year’s final days like a boxer on the ropes. After punching through records and shaking up financial markets, the apex crypto is now bleeding value. As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $95,260, down 4% in 24 hours. After an incredible year, BTC looks dead set on finishing in the red. This is a sharp fall from its record high of $108,316 on December 17, a brutal December and its first monthly decline in four months. Even President-elect Donald Trump’s crypto enthusiasm hasn’t been enough to hold the line. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s smaller siblings, Ether and Dogecoin, are also struggling. Options expiry adds chaos to the mix Friday isn’t just the end of a bad trading week, it’s also one of the most important days in Bitcoin’s history. A massive number of Bitcoin and Ether options contracts are set to expire, creating the perfect storm for price swings. FalconX, a top crypto brokerage, called it “one of the largest options expirations ever.” They added that: “Liquidity trends indicate that the chop around $100k could persist. While sentiment has turned more cautious, we still think a choppy price action near-term preparing the ground for a bullish trajectory into Q1 2025 remains the most likely scenario.” Meanwhile, as Bitcoin stumbles, gold has been chilling. The precious metal was trading at $2,633 an ounce at press time, holding steady after some wild moves earlier this year. Mixed jobless claims data from the U.S. have done little to change market sentiment. Recurring claims hit a three-year high, showing people are struggling to find jobs. But new claims dipped slightly, leaving the Federal Reserve with more questions than answers. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the labor market is cooling but not crashing. The Fed has pulled back on its 2025 rate-cut expectations, choosing to wait for more signs that inflation is under control. That’s kept gold’s rally in check, even though it’s still up 28% this year thanks to central banks stocking up and investors seeking a haven. For now, gold has clearly overpowered Bitcoin completely.

Ali Martinez (@ali_charts), a crypto analyst, compiled the viewpoints of several market veterans on X , offering a multi-perspective take on the likelihood of an impending correction. Bitcoin Price Crash Incoming? One of the voices in this discussion is Tone Vays, a well-known trader who has expressed grave concerns about Bitcoin’s trajectory. Vays conveyed that Bitcoin trading below $95,000 is “very, very bad” as it heightens the likelihood of a correction to around $73,000. In a shared video, Vays elaborated, “We’re now opening the month day trading below $95,000, getting too close to the $92,000 range literally opens like Pandora’s box into a massive crash down to $73,000. Now, I’m not saying it’s going to crash $73,000. I’m saying the possibility has significantly increased that we can easily go to $73,000. You are sitting at the last line of support.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve Idea Sparks Cautious Response From Japan PM: Report Peter Brandt, another prominent analyst, added to the growing concern by discussing the formation of a “broadening triangle” in Bitcoin’s price chart. According to Brandt, this pattern could potentially project a retracement toward the $70,000 zone. Although Brandt was careful to clarify that his statements are not definitive predictions, he emphasized the increased possibility of such a movement. “Hey trolls — this is not a prediction. Just always pointing out possibilities, not probabilities, not ‘certainties’. No screen shot is necessary, BTC right angled broadening triangle could project back into the $70,000s and a test of the parabolic modality,” Brandt stated. Contrasting with these bearish viewpoints, Fundstrat maintains a more optimistic long-term perspective, predicting that Bitcoin could reach $250,000 by 2025. However, Fundstrat’s Global Head of Technical Strategy, Mark Newton, acknowledges the potential for short-term volatility, suggesting that Bitcoin might experience a downswing to $60,000 before embarking on its ascent. In a video shared by Martinez, Fundstrat CEO Tom Lee elaborated on this outlook: “Bitcoin, one year from now, I think is something around $250,000. […] it is hyper volatile. People don’t like the volatility. Yeah, Mark Newton, our technician, thinks that the cycle of Bitcoin turns a little bit down early next year, so maybe Bitcoin gets to the $60,000s.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Still Close To Extreme Greed: More Cooldown Needed For Bottom? Adding to the chorus of caution, Benjamin Cowen, CEO and Founder of Into The Cryptoverse, posits that Bitcoin’s price action could mirror that of the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ). According to Cowen, this alignment could precipitate a “flash crash” to $60,000, potentially coinciding with Donald Trump’s inauguration day. From an on-chain analysis standpoint, Martinez confirms the bearish possibilities. He notes that if Bitcoin falls below $93,806, the path to $70,085 becomes increasingly plausible, describing the area below as “open air all the way down to $70,085.” Martinez identifies the critical support zone between $97,041 and $93,806, emphasizing that failure to maintain these levels could trigger a sharp decline. He observes that market dynamics indicate some investors are preparing for such a downturn, evidenced by the transfer of over 33,000 BTC (valued at more than $3.23 billion) to exchanges in the past week. Additionally, profit-taking appears to be intensifying, with more than $7.17 billion in Bitcoin profits realized on December 23 alone. The proportion of Binance traders with open long positions on BTC has also decreased from 66.73% to 53.60%, suggesting a shift in market sentiment towards a more bearish stance. Ultimately, Martinez underscores the importance of Bitcoin reclaiming the $97,300 support zone to invalidate the bearish forecasts. “Bitcoin recently broke below one of its most significant support zones at $97,300. So, for the bearish outlook to be invalidated, BTC must reclaim this critical area of support and, more importantly, sustain a daily close above $100,000,” he states. Should Bitcoin manage to sustain a daily close above $100,000, Martinez posits the potential for a significant upswing, possibly reaching $168,500 based on the Mayer Multiple. However, the failure to do so leaves the door open for the predicted corrections to materialize. At press time, BTC traded at $96,905.

Central to its growth has been the dramatic expansion of its Plutus-based smart contract ecosystem, a critical infrastructure that has evolved significantly since its introduction. At the heart of this transformation lies Plutus V2, which has seen unparalleled adoption over the year. On January 1, Cardano hosted 8,083 Plutus V2 scripts, but by December 27, that number had soared to 104,606—an increase of 96,523 contracts. Interestingly, Plutus V1 scripts, though overshadowed by V2, continue to play a vital role in Cardano’s smart contract landscape. The year began with 6,296 V1 scripts, which grew steadily to 6,869 by late December, adding 573 new contracts. While modest in comparison, this growth highlights the continued relevance of earlier iterations for certain use cases, proving that Cardano’s ecosystem retains flexibility and depth. Across all iterations, Cardano’s smart contract ecosystem expanded by a staggering 97,534 contracts in 2024, according to data retrieved by Finbold from Cardano Blockchain Insights . Cardano smart contracts. Source: Cardano Blockchain Insights Plutus V3 The introduction of Plutus V3 in 2024 marked a pivotal moment for Cardano, coinciding with the Chang Hard Fork and its subsequent deployment on the SanchoNet testnet. This latest iteration began rolling out on-chain contracts in late August, and by year’s end, 438 Plutus V3 contracts had been recorded. Plutus V3 introduced improved smart contract efficiency, advanced interoperability, and enhanced security features. Notably, the upgrade also slashes development costs, positioning Cardano as an increasingly attractive platform for builders seeking cost-effective yet powerful solutions for decentralized finance ( DeFi ), decentralized application (dApp) ecosystems, non-fungible tokens ( NFTs ), and other cutting-edge applications. The Alonzo Hard Fork in 2021 laid the foundation for this expansion, introducing Plutus-based smart contracts to the Cardano network. Over time, these contracts have evolved to deliver enhanced functionality, security, and interoperability, making Cardano a preferred choice for developers looking to push the boundaries of blockchain innovation. ADA’s market resurgence This technical evolution has not gone unnoticed by investors. ADA’s price has steadily gained momentum throughout 2024, driven by optimism surrounding Cardano’s growing utility and developer adoption. Currently trading at $0.9074, ADA is up 4.5% on the day and boasts an impressive year-to-date gain of 52.79%, re-establishing itself among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. well-equipped to compete in the next phase of blockchain innovation.

One particular feature that distinguishes Lunex Network from other new cryptos in the market is its cross-chain trading. This trading feature enables users to access over thousands of assets across different blockchains. Lunex Network also ensures anonymity for users who prefer unregulated transactions by not requesting any special KYC checks. For top traders, the platform provides a Pro plan with benefits like transaction cashback, better staking options, and wallet checks. The wallet checks allow Pro users to verify if wallets meet compliance standards, which will ensure secure transactions. Litecoin update reveals recent price uptick In the past month, LTC has seen one of the most impressive growths in the DeFi market as it went up to $103 by rising 15.35%. This growth is evidence that LTC has witnessed one of its lost remarkable price gains this year. According to Litecoin news, LTC’s amazing growth has resulted in increased attention from traders and market watchers. That’s not all; This rise also pushed LTC’s market cap to $7.7 billion dollars. This is why LTC now stands at the twenty-fourth position on CoinMarketCap’s top 30 list. While it is not as prominent as Bitcoin or Ethereum, LTC could steadily rise further and potentially hit $200 in early 2025 if the market stays bullish. XRP rallies post Trump endorsement and presidential win Ripple’s XRP has risen by over 100% in the past month and is now up nearly 300% from its value of $0.6 at the start of 2024. As a result of this growth, XRP has become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency globally, with a market cap of about $134 billion. Many XRP experts believe that one major reason for this surge is the market’s rally after Donald Trump’s presidential election win. Trump’s promise to make the U.S. the “crypto capital” of the world has fueled optimism about a pro-crypto administration. Given Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. SEC, it was positively affected by Trump’s influence. Based on the information on its price charts, XRP’s recent performance suggests this could be the start of an even bigger rally under the Trump administration. Conclusion While LTC and XRP are maintaining their status as some of DeFi’s bullish crypto tokens, Lunex Network is set to join them soon. However, when it comes to earning potential, Lunex Network takes the crown with its live presale, which has already raised over $5.5 million through the sale of LNEX tokens. These LNEX tokens are currently priced at $0.0048 via Lunex Network’s presale. To learn more about Lunex Network, visit the website and its socials .

38178181,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398798,1735294349,"Best Cryptocurrency Picks for 2025 Market Surge: BlockBoost($BBT), Tron and Solana Set for Massive Returns","The post Best Cryptocurrency Picks for 2025 Market Surge: BlockBoost($BBT), Tron and Solana Set for Massive Returns appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The market continues to recover with Bitcoin trading above $94K and Ethereum going up about 4% in the past 24 hours. Investors are looking for promising altcoins to diversify their investment portfolios. This month’s top picks are BlockBoost ($BBT), Tron (TRX), and Solana (SOL). BlockBoost, a new contender in town, stands out as the platform that will help investors create millions. Investors continue to rush to buy $BBT as 2025 approaches. Let us dive into why this fresh coin is rapidly dominating the crypto market. BlockBoost: Empowering Crypto Investors and Startups BlockBoost ($BBT) has taken the crypto world by storm, offering a platform that promises to vet and provide a launchpad for new cryptocurrencies with 1000%+ growth potential.

Tron’s Road to Recovery Until 2025 Tron’s native cryptocurrency, TRX, recently reached a peak of $0.4407, before falling 43% to its current price of $0.251, a modest increase of 2.22% in the last 24 hours. Despite this drop, Tron has seen impressive transaction volume, with 182 million transactions in October, 167 million in November, and 135 million in December. The community hopes for a price surge, aiming for the 50-cent mark by the end of December. However, CoinCodex’s predictions suggest TRX will end the month at $0.2598, still below the desired target. This forecast indicates a slight increase from its current level but remains far from the anticipated high. Investors will need to closely watch how the asset performs as the year closes, with the potential for further price shifts in the coming months. Insights on Solana(SOL) Solana’s DeFi ecosystem faced significant setbacks in December 2024, with its Total Value Locked (TVL) dropping by $1.1 billion, reaching $8.01 billion, a 12% decrease . This decline reflects a broader slowdown, marked by a 7% drop in daily active addresses. Flagship DeFi protocols, like Jito, also saw losses, with its TVL plunging by 28% to $2.66 billion. Additionally, Solana’s network revenue fell by 24% since the beginning of December, signaling a broader reduction in activity. The SOL token has been severely impacted, dropping 28% in value within a month. Currently trading at $0.251 , its technical indicators like the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) at -0.04 point to increased selling pressure, reinforcing a bearish outlook. However, some analysts believe a price recovery above $200 could restore investor confidence and revitalize the network, suggesting that Solana may still have the potential for a rebound despite current challenges. Concussion Recent analysis shows that TRX and SOL could potentially soar to new prices in 2025. However, BlockBoost’s anticipated rise impressively surpasses the two cryptos due to its 500x potential growth. Amazingly, the platform provides a space for various kinds of investors to get their pockets fat when it goes mainstream. If you missed out on the early days of TRX and SOL, invest in BlockBoost and enjoy the spoils.

38178070,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398803,1735294217,SUI Will Outperform XRP and Solana in the 2025 Bull Run: Raoul Pal,"The post SUI Will Outperform XRP and Solana in the 2025 Bull Run: Raoul Pal appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Sui Network (SUI) is gearing up for a significant event on January 1, 2025, when nearly $300 million worth of its native token will be unlocked. This is part of Sui’s regular monthly process, which increases the circulating supply and can impact investor holdings and market dynamics. Despite a 5.31% drop over the past week, SUI has been performing strongly overall. The token surged by 31.25% in the past month, reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $4.93, up from under $1. Currently priced at $4.26, it has achieved an impressive one-year gain of 413%, outpacing XRP’s 250% gain. Analysts predict that SUI could rise by another $5 in the coming months, with the potential for even higher gains. With its strong performance, many investors are asking whether SUI is the right choice for profit-taking. Let’s take a closer look at its growth potential. Raoul Pal’s Bullish Outlook for SUI Raoul Pal, CEO of Real Vision, is optimistic about SUI’s future, believing it could outperform major players like XRP and Solana (SOL) in the upcoming bull run . He points to SUI’s breakout from an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern as a sign of its potential for growth. Based on Pal’s analysis, many expect SUI to reach above $5 by Q1 2025, with some even predicting higher levels. SUI vs. Solana and XRP While Pal recognizes Solana’s strength as a well-established protocol, he sees SUI as a riskier but potentially more rewarding investment. He believes SUI’s upward momentum could surpass that of XRP, Solana, and even Ethereum (ETH), despite XRP showing signs of an explosive move after breaking a seven-year downtrend. Pal advises investors to balance their portfolios by focusing on established coins while considering small investments in high-growth assets like SUI to navigate the current bear market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Magic Eden (ME) Price Surge: What’s Driving the Rally? , Technically, Good Time to Invest in SUI? SUI’s Total Value Locked (TVL) recently surpassed $1.65 billion, fueling its price momentum. This milestone reflects the growth of its ecosystem, supported by bullish chart patterns, including a breakout from a head-and-shoulders formation. However, technical indicators such as the MACD histogram turning negative suggest caution, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains neutral. SUI is giving tough competition to XRP is quite surprising for crypto investors who are looking for a new investment opportunity. Since the coin is down at this moment it is a good time to stack the coin before the price rises. SUI’s rise has been nothing short of remarkable, and with continued growth, it may just be the next big thing in crypto. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

To make staking more attractive, Jupiter has introduced a reward structure where users earn 0.1 JUP for every 1 JUP token they stake. This initiative not only encourages users to stake but also helps build a strong staking community, contributing to the platform’s long-term sustainability. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : How Will Donald Trump’s Pro-Crypto Plans Impact Bitcoin Price? , JUP’s Long-Term Plan for 2025 Jupiter’s vision for 2025 is even more ambitious. The platform plans to distribute an incredible 4.25 billion JUP tokens throughout the year. Of this total, 4.175 billion tokens will be allocated directly to users and the community, while the remaining 75 million tokens will continue to reward staking investors. Since the announcement, JUP’s price has been rising, currently trading at $0.857, up by 2.6% in just one day. Jupiter’s airdrop and staking rewards strategy not only strengthen its position in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space but also set the stage for a strong 2025. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

38178207,https://thecoinrise.com/bitcoin-taker-buy-volume-hints-at-potential-year-end-rally-details/,1735293909,Bitcoin Taker Buy Volume Hints at Potential Year-End Rally: Details,"Bitcoin may be gearing up for another rally, according to a widely followed trading metric. CryptoQuant analyst Burrakesmeci has highlighted the upward trend in Binance Bitcoin Taker Buy Volume, a key indicator that tracks buyer activity on the exchange. As Bitcoin approaches the end of 2024, its ability to reclaim the $100,000 mark hinges on a combination of market sentiment, institutional interest, and broader economic conditions. Higher Lows Signal Investor Interest Since October 28, Binance Bitcoin Taker Buy Volume has been forming “higher lows,” a strong technical signal often associated with mounting buying pressure and increased investor interest. Taker Buy Volume measures the total volume of buy orders executed by “takers,” or traders willing to accept the market’s best immediate price. On December 1, the volume fell below $5 billion but gradually climbed to just under $6 billion by mid-December. As of December 25, the figure was holding steady at approximately $6 billion. “These higher lows suggest that investor sentiment is building toward another potential price increase for Bitcoin,” Burrakesmeci commented. Despite market corrections, this sustained rise in taker buy volume could pave the way for upward momentum in the days ahead. Comparisons to 2023 Currently trading at $96,222, Bitcoin is down 11.2% from its all-time high of $108,300 recorded on December 17. It last crossed the $100,000 level on December 19 but has struggled to maintain momentum amid market fluctuations. Analysts and traders are drawing parallels between Bitcoin’s recent price movements and its trajectory in December 2023, a period marked by substantial gains following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January . Last year, Bitcoin surged nearly 90% in the three months following the ETF approvals, fueling hopes that a similar pattern may unfold. Pseudonymous trader Jack, in a December 26 post on X, observed striking similarities in Bitcoin’s price action between the two periods. Another analyst, Titan of Crypto, also stated that the current chart pattern seems to mirror late 2023’s movements, albeit on an accelerated timeline. While no guarantees exist, these technical signals and historical trends are encouraging some traders to anticipate a bullish close to the year.

Airdrop Details and Eligibility The Jupiter team is finalizing specific criteria for the airdrop, with ongoing discussions within the community to refine the eligibility guidelines. The distribution strategy focuses on two main groups: Users and Stakers: Rewards will be distributed based on trading activity and staking contributions. Carrots and Good Cats: A designation for prominent community supporters who will receive additional incentives. The draft eligibility framework suggests that trading volume on Jupiter products in the past year will play a significant role. For example, users with an annual trading volume of at least $800 will receive 50 tokens, while those with a trading volume of $29,000 will be given 250 tokens. This isn’t Jupiter’s first major token distribution. The platform has already given away around 1 billion JUP tokens in 2023 to users who had traded at least $1,000 in volume prior to a snapshot taken in November of that year. Tokenomics Update JUP’s circulating supply is currently 1.35 billion tokens with a maximum supply of 10 billion tokens. However, Jupiter plans to burn 3 billion tokens in August 2024 in a move approved by the community, reducing the maximum supply to 7 billion. Jupiter's Role in the Solana Ecosystem Launched in October 2021 by developer nicknamed “Meow,” Jupiter aggregates liquidity from various DEXs on Solana to provide users with the best rates for token swaps. The platform also offers perpetual trading products, adding to its utility and appeal. Over the past 24 hours, Jupiter reported an impressive $2.3 billion in trading volume, underscoring its important role in the Solana ecosystem. *This is not investment advice.

The tokenless chain by Coinbase carries more than 8M transactions per day, and is a leader both in raw numbers and in the complexity of tokenized transfers. Base is leading the momentum of L2 chains, in addition to the expansion of Arbitrum and Optimism. The L2 narrative slowed down in 2024 when it came to general hype, but the actual infrastructure was one of the most widely used Web3 features. Base reached a record of 8.8M transactions per day, surpassing other top L2s which together achieve 5.5M transactions per day. The L2 expansion at the end of 2024 shifted its priorities, unlike the earlier days of airdrop farming. The trend matches the expectations for 2025, where apps would be the drivers of activity and adoption. Base led the way, and top L2s retained peak transaction counts toward the end of 2024. | Source: GrowThePie The past year shifted the balance of L2 chains, displacing Polygon in several categories. The Polygon chain derived most of its activity from Polymarket bets. The chain retains legacy status for some apps, though it lost its previous inflow of activity based on Web3 games and NFTs. Toward the end of 2024, Polygon was lagging as projects picked other networks to launch their apps and tokens. L2 chains are also absorbing value, both through native token launches and inflows from Ethereum. Based on L2Beat data, L2 chains lock in more than $58B , mostly held within optimistic rollups. Toward the end of 2024, Ethereum held $68.42B in value locked, mostly based on LidoDAO and Aave. L2s retain varied app profiles The growth in L2 activity comes from each chain retaining a profile of apps and activities. Arbitrum and Optimism established themselves as hubs for DeFi and DEX trading. Base gets its heightened activity from high-liquidity trading and moving cbBTC, the newly issued wrapped BTC token. The other source of activity is AI agents, after Virtuals Protocol launched on Base. AI agents are tokenized, and are quickly becoming the most actively traded asset class on Base. Different chains are leaders in their category, specializing in specific smart contracts. DeFi activity made ZK Sync Era, Arbitrum, and Optimism peak performers. Base is the leader in CeFi activity , as it carries some of the utility transactions for Coinbase. For the Taiko chain, WETH9 is the busiest smart contract , fueling DeFi with a wrapped version of Ethereum. For Base, the leading contract is a MEV strategy executor. Those contracts are the most prominent based on gas burned, due to bandwidth constraints and competition. For Base, the contract with the biggest transaction count belongs to Uniswap V3. Recently, the Uniswap DEX also posted a record , after achieving peak monthly volume on its Base version. L2s keep adding to Ethereum burn L2 chains have shown they can successfully scale Ethereum tasks and carry high-speed activity. As of December 27, L2 blob fees were the third-biggest source of ETH burns, helping to curb inflation. Blob fees continue to be a top factor for daily ETH burns. | Source: Ultrasound Money Ethereum is still slightly inflationary, with inflation going back to 0.5% annualized. Most L2s are competing for blob space on Ethereum, but paying out relatively small fees to use the L1 layer. Taiko remains one of the most common sources of payments to L1, as the chain does not slow down its transaction posting to Ethereum. The past year saw conflicts arise on the exact role of L2s and whether they were harming Ethereum. In the second half of the year, L2 chains achieved a form of equilibrium, as both Ethereum participants and L2 validators could earn fees. Some apps continue to use their Ethereum versions, making the L1 chain retain some of the busiest smart contracts. Ethereum is still the biggest carrier of stablecoins , as the ERC-20 version of USDT is the most widely traded and transacted. L2 chains have taken up some of the transaction count and meme token activity, but they have only retained a fraction of the available stablecoin liquidity. Instead, L2s use wrapped versions of ETH as a valuable collateral, and expand by hosting a new selection of decentralized apps.

Hackers have been using sophisticated techniques to steal private keys, wallet data, and other sensitive information, which has resulted in substantial financial loss for victims. The attackers used a phishing domain that mimicked a legitimate Zoom domain, “app[.] us4zoom[.] us.”, reported SlowMist on Dec. 27. Source: SlowMist The scam site illustrated Zoom’s interface and tricked users into hitting the “Launch Meeting” button. The button did not open the Zoom application; it started downloading a malicious installation package called “ZoomApp_v.3. 14. dmg.” After installation, this package ran a script called “ZoomApp.file” that asked users to put in their system password. https://twitter.com/SlowMist_Team/status/1872526964789219563 Upon analyzing, SlowMist reported that the script called a hidden executable file to deploy named “.ZoomApp”. The app tried to access data like system information, browser cookies, KeyChain data, and cryptocurrency wallet credentials. The compressed data was then transmitted to a server under the hackers’ control, associated with the IP address 141.98.9.20, which has been labeled as malicious by multiple threat intelligence services.

This included stored passwords, cryptocurrency wallet details, and sensitive Telegram credentials, among other information. This allowed the attackers to obtain wallet mnemonic phrases and private keys, which facilitated the theft of large amounts of cryptocurrency. The attackers’ back-end system, located in the Netherlands, tracked user interactions through the Telegram API, with signs that they employed Russian-language scripts. The phishing campaign went live on Nov. 14, 2024, and has already attempted to steal millions of dollars in crypto from various users.

38177094,https://crypto.news/?p=14322558,1735292171,BONK price falls over 7% after burning 1.69 trillion tokens-what’s going on?,"Solana-based meme coin Bonk continued its downward rally despite the project recently burning 1.69 trillion BONK tokens. On Dec. 26, over 1.8% of BONK’s entire supply, amounting to 1.69 trillion tokens worth over $51 million was burned as part of the dog-themed meme coin’s community holiday token burning event dubbed the “BURNmas.” Based on community participation in Burnmas, the amended vote has passed and 1.69 Trillion $BONK has been burnt from the @bonk_dao multisig The Total Supply of $BONK is now down to 91 Trillion Tokens from it's original 100 Trillion ❗️❗️❗️ #LetsBONK — BONK!!! (@bonk_inu) December 26, 2024 Initially proposed in late November, the project planned to burn 1,000 BONK for every X post using the hashtag #LetsBONK, and 10,000 BONK for every new follower gained on Instagram and TikTok, with a final target of burning 1 trillion tokens. The idea was to spur community engagement and increase visibility for the token during the holiday season. However, due to higher-than-expected engagement across social media platforms, the initial target of 1 trillion tokens was surpassed. In response, BonkDAO members voted in favor of an updated proposal to increase the burn amount to 1.69 trillion tokens. You might also like: BonkDAO announces plans to burn 1.69t BONK in “BURNmas” event Token burns are a common occurrence in the crypto space, especially among meme coins like BONK, which boasts a total supply of 100 trillion tokens, now reduced to 90.97 trillion after recent burns. By permanently removing a chunk of tokens from circulation, these events aim to tighten supply dynamics, theoretically boosting scarcity and, in turn, driving up the token’s value. For instance, following BONK’s previous token burn event on July 29, when 84 million tokens valued at over $2 million at the time were removed from circulation, it resulted in a 25% rally for the token. This time, however, the BURNmas spectacle failed to deliver, with the token dropping over 7% following the event with its market cap hovering around $2.3 billion. Why is BONK price going down? While there was no solid reason that sparked the sell-off, BONK’s ( BONK ) decline coincided with a broader downturn in the crypto market, fueled by a risk-off sentiment driven by Bitcoin’s lackluster performance, struggling to recover above the $100k mark. Additionally, holiday-induced low trading activity saw BONK’s volume drop over 8% in the past 24 hours. Frustration also brewed among several BONK enthusiasts, who voiced dissatisfaction over the team’s failure to execute the token burn on Christmas Day as originally promised. This delay may have dampened investor confidence and contributed to the sell-off. Another potential reason why BONK dropped is that many investors may have rotated their investments into Pudgy Penguins’ token, Pengu (PENGU). Just days after launching, PENGU amassed a market cap of over $2.2 billion and even briefly surpassed BONK as the largest meme coin on the Solana blockchain on Dec. 26. The token has also outperformed BONK over the past week, gaining over 32% compared to BONK’s 7.2% rally. At press time, the token had formed a god candle on its daily chart, which is typically a sign of whale activity. The sudden price rise managed to mitigate some of the day’s losses, bringing the token’s price to $0.000030. If more investors follow suit, it could spark the next leg up for the meme coin toward the key resistance level at $0.000034, a level BONK has tested twice this week but failed to breach.

The SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds has eased concerns, but macroeconomic factors now take center stage. “Inflation should not present a major issue next year,” the report states, adding that this could allow the Fed to maintain a dovish stance.

38176996,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633794,1735291929,‘Crypto president’ Trump takes the spotlight away from Europe’s fancy MiCA regulation,"Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly America is stealing Europe’s thunder, and it’s not even subtle. While the European Union spent years crafting its shiny new Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation ( MiCA ), Trump came in swinging with promises to make the U.S. “the crypto capital of the planet.” The result? Crypto giants like Binance are dumping Europe and packing their bags for the States. Bitcoin’s insane rally to $108,000 this year—double what it was last year—is no coincidence. Trump’s win and his plans to overhaul U.S. crypto regulations have pumped confidence back into the market. Retail and institutional investors are betting on a White House that actually wants crypto to thrive. MiCA , meanwhile, looks like an over-engineered relic that no one has time for. MiCA faces trouble as costs pile up MiCA is supposed to clean up the crypto mess left by disasters like FTX, Genesis, and Celsius. It forces companies offering services like trading and custody to get authorized in the EU. But it comes with a fat price tag. Even Tether, the world’s biggest stablecoin, won’t comply with MiCA and is getting kicked off regulated EU exchanges. Some companies, like Coinbase and Circle, have managed to secure their licenses, though it’s clear the EU is bleeding talent. Meanwhile, Trump is rolling out the red carpet. He’s appointing pro-crypto folks like Paul Atkins as SEC chair and David Sacks as a White House crypto czar. “We’re going to do something great with crypto,” Trump said recently. Companies that fled U.S. regulations under Biden are now scrambling to come back. Binance US’s interim CEO, Norman Reed, even teased a return of dollar services in 2025, saying, “It is not a matter of if, but when.” Trump’s big crypto plans crush EU hopes Trump’s administration also wants to set up a national Bitcoin reserve, pouring $21 billion annually into the plan over five years. This would make the U.S. a global leader in Bitcoin holdings, leaving Europe to play catch-up. The Bitcoin Policy Institute has been screaming about this for years, and now it looks like Trump is the first to actually listen. Access to banking is also on Trump’s to-do list. His administration plans to order banks to provide services to crypto companies, reversing the hostile stance seen under Biden. This means no more shutting out crypto firms just because they’re crypto. Industry insiders are betting this will bring a flood of new investments into the U.S. market. While Europe fiddles with MiCA, Trump’s team is drafting new principles for agencies like the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The goal is to create a system that actually works for businesses, unlike the restrictive measures slapped down during Biden’s term.

However, renowned analysts are sounding the alarm, predicting a drastic correction to $60,000. #Bitcoin $BTC will CRASH to $60,000!!! At least, that's what some of the most renowned analysts are saying. Let's dive in — Ali (@ali_charts) December 26, 2024 Tone Vays believes that trading below $95,000 is a ominous sign, increasing the likelihood of a downturn to $73,000. Peter Brandt echoes this sentiment, warning of a potential breakdown below $70,000. Meanwhile, Fundstrat’s optimistic forecast of $250,000 by 2025 is tempered by Mark Newton’s prediction of a near-term drop to $60,000. Is Bitcoin Gearing For A Major Dip? On-chain analysis suggests that a correction to $70,000 is plausible, with a significant support zone breached at $97,300. Savvy investors appear to be bracing for impact, with over 33,000 bitcoins worth $3.23 billion flowing into exchanges in the past week. Profit-taking is also on the rise, with $7.17 billion in bitcoin profits realized on December 23 alone. Bitcoin has jumped to as high as $99.8K on a bullish Christmas crypto performance.

38176790,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376386,1735291591,Vivek Ramaswamy’s Strive Asset Management Files for Bitcoin Bond ETF with SEC,"Strive Asset Management, led by billionaire entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, has filed a request with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch an exchange-traded fund (ETF) focused on Bitcoin-linked convertible bonds. The proposed Strive Bitcoin Bond ETF is designed to offer exposure to bonds issued by corporations that use the proceeds to purchase Bitcoin as part of their treasury strategies. The Bitcoin Bond ETF In a December 27 post on X, the firm stated, “Strive’s first of many planned Bitcoin solutions will democratize access to Bitcoin bonds, which are bonds issued by corporations to purchase Bitcoin.” The announcement further noted that these bonds offer attractive risk-return characteristics associated with Bitcoin but are currently out of reach for most investors. The ETF aims to bridge this gap by providing everyday Americans and institutional investors with easier access to BTC-related financial instruments. According to the filing submitted on December 26, the proposed ETF will invest in securities from companies like MicroStrategy, which has become a prominent player in corporate Bitcoin adoption. Since 2020, under the leadership of Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy has invested approximately $27 billion in the coin. These purchases were financed through equity offerings and convertible bonds, which typically carry low or no interest but can be converted into shares under specified conditions. The Strive Bitcoin Bond ETF will be actively managed and will achieve its exposure to BTC-linked bonds either directly or through derivatives such as swaps and options. To maintain liquidity and collateral for these instruments, the fund will invest in high-quality, short-term assets like U.S. Treasuries and money market instruments. While details regarding the management fee have not been disclosed, actively managed funds often come with higher fees compared to passive alternatives. Strategic Context Since its start in 2022, Strive Asset Management has focused on addressing long-term economic risks, including the global fiat debt crisis, inflation, and geopolitical tensions. The company stated, “We strongly believe there is no better long-term investment to hedge against these risks than thoughtful exposure to Bitcoin.” The asset manager views the flagship cryptocurrency as an important part of a diversified investment portfolio, encouraging both individual and institutional investors to allocate funds directly to Bitcoin, BTC bonds, and companies focused on the cryptocurrency. Ramaswamy, who launched Strive with a focus on capitalism-driven strategies, has maintained a high-profile presence in both business and politics. Although he briefly ran against Donald Trump in the 2023 Republican presidential primary, he later endorsed the President-elect. Upon winning, Trump appointed Ramaswamy to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), an initiative aimed at reducing government waste, with X owner Elon Musk.

Citi Analysts Explained!,"The year 2024, which began with the acceptance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, ends with Donald Trump's presidential victory. Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies are leaving behind a record-breaking year, driven by major events such as ETF approval and Trump's election victory. So What Awaits Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies in 2025? While there are many predictions on this subject, Citi analysts recently announced their expectations for 2025. According to Business Insider, Citi analysts listed six factors that will determine the future of cryptocurrencies. Citi analysts predict strong crypto growth in 2025 driven by Trump policies, rising ETF inflows, and stablecoin innovations. “Bitcoin ETFs kicked off the sector’s rally in January. In September, a series of central bank rate cuts and other policies contributed to the rally, paving the way for a growth economy. But no development was more critical for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies than Donald Trump’s victory, which helped push Bitcoin past the $100,000 mark for the first time, sending altcoins soaring. We expect this rise to continue in 2025.” Analysts, who explained the 6 factors that will support the rise in 2025, put ETF inflows in the first place. Citi analysts stated that they expect spot Bitcoin ETF inflows to continue strongly in 2025 and that it will be the most important driving force of the rise. Analysts said that apart from ETFs, the positive regulations of the Trump administration, the expanding stablecoin market, the macroeconomic environment, the widespread use of crypto, and the increasing portfolio allocation ratio will support the rise in BTC and crypto. Citi analysts said the macroeconomic environment is likely to support risky assets such as cryptocurrencies through the first quarter of 2025. Additionally, analysts noted that institutions will increase their allocations of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, adding that the increased allocation could boost the price of Bitcoin. Analysts recently said that Trump, who is preparing to take office in January 2025, will implement policies that could significantly affect the crypto market, which would be positive for prices. “Trump promised to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve and create a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment,” they said. *This is not investment advice.

A new study shows that almost 65% of Ethereum ‘s transactions could be processed at the same time, potentially making the network much faster. In a Friday blog post , analysts at layer-1 network Sei ( SEI ) revealed that many of Ethereum’s transactions don’t depend on each other and could run simultaneously, allowing the network to handle more transactions and improve its speed. Right now, Ethereum processes transactions one after another, which is also known as sequential processing. For example, if someone sends 1 ( ETH ) to one person and then that person sends 1 ETH to someone else, these transactions need to happen one after the other. If they were processed at the same time, the second one would be wrong because your balance wouldn’t be updated yet. Yet, some transactions don’t affect each other, Sei’s study reveals. You might also like: Starknet debuts parallel transaction execution on testnet As analysts at Sei explain, if Bob sends 1 ETH to Alice and someone else sends you 1 ETH at the same time, they don’t interfere with each other. These transactions can happen in parallel, meaning they can be processed at the same time. The study found that 64.85% of Ethereum transactions are like this, meaning they could be processed in parallel, without waiting for others to finish. If this method is used, Ethereum could process many more transactions and become faster. “Each block averages 60.77 dependent transactions, indicating significant potential for parallel execution optimization.” Sei However, there are still some challenges. Some transactions still need to be processed one after the other because they rely on each other, what is also known as dependency. According to Sei’s calculations, about 35.15% of transactions on Ethereum are dependent on others. There are different ways to improve Ethereum’s speed. One idea is called “optimistic concurrency control,” a method used by the Sei protocol, which lets transactions happen at the same time, assuming they won’t cause problems. After the transactions finish, the system checks if any conflicts happened. If there’s a problem, the system can redo those transactions. This approach could help Ethereum process transactions faster while keeping things simple for developers. In the future, Ethereum could also use sharding , which splits the network into smaller pieces to help process transactions faster, Sei admits.

38176660,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633796,1735290944,Tether invests $2M in Arcanum Capital’s Web3 fund,"Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin issuer, is looking to diversify its operations and broaden its influence in Web3 technology. The company has made a $2 million injection into Arcanum Capital’s Emerging Technologies Fund II, signaling its commitment to advancing Web3 projects. As reported by the Financial news portal Traders Union, Tether’s investment in Arcanum Capital’s fund focuses on decentralized Web3 initiatives, aiming to enhance financial privacy, facilitate cross-border payments, and expand banking access for the unbanked. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino stressed the need to preserve individual freedoms in financial systems, emphasizing the role of censorship-resistant technologies. “ A key concern today is the evolving relationship between financial systems and individual freedoms, particularly in the context of increasing restrictions on open communication ,” Ardoino stated. Arcanum’s Managing Partner, James McDowall, also highlighted the fund’s mission to address vulnerabilities in traditional financial systems, particularly in geopolitically sensitive regions. The focus on blockchain-based secure remittance solutions seemingly aligns with Tether’s broader goals of financial autonomy and decentralization. Tether seeks diversification through strategic investments Tether’s investment in Arcanum is just one part of its diversification strategy. In October, Tether facilitated a $45 million oil transaction using its USDT stablecoin and proposed a boron-backed token to the Turkish government, leveraging Turkey’s global dominance in boron production. The company also made headlines in December with a $775 million commitment to Rumble, a video platform known for its emphasis on free speech. The investment includes a $250 million cash injection and support for Rumble’s tender offer to purchase 70 million shares. Following the announcement, Rumble’s stock surged by 50% in after-hours trading, showcasing Tether’s growing influence beyond cryptocurrency markets. Tether is also venturing into artificial intelligence (AI), with plans to launch an AI platform in Q1 2025. According to CEO Ardoino, this platform will allow users to interact with AI through mobile devices, marking a significant step in the company’s innovation roadmap. “ Next year, we plan to deploy at least half of the profits in investments,” Ardoino said, underlining Tether’s aggressive approach to growth and diversification. “Our investment is just at the beginning .” Regulatory challenges and opportunities While the entity is experiencing significant growth, with its market capitalization surpassing $140 billion in 2024, the company faces regulatory challenges in Europe. The introduction of the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations has made the relationship between the stablecoin issuer and European exchanges uneasy. The European Union issued a directive mandating the delisting of USDT from exchanges by December 30, 2024, unless it complies with MiCA regulations. MiCA, the EU’s comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, imposes strict requirements for transparency, auditing, and oversight of stablecoins. As one of the most actively traded digital assets, USDT faces potential removal from European exchanges if it fails to meet these standards, potentially causing significant disruptions to market activity and investor confidence. Analysts suggest this could limit the stablecoin issuer’s reach in the region, but it also provides an opportunity to focus on the Americas, where crypto adoption is accelerating. In the US, Tether’s expansion efforts align well with the crypto-friendly policies expected under President-elect Donald Trump’s administration. Howard Lutnick , CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald and a major Tether stakeholder, is set to join Trump’s cabinet as Commerce Secretary. Lutnick’s involvement is expected to foster a favorable regulatory environment for digital assets and could aid Tether’s US growth trajectory.

38176447,https://coinpaprika.com/news/will-sam-bankman-fried-get-a-presidential-pardon-from-biden-,1735290862,Will Sam Bankman-Fried Get a Presidential Pardon from Biden?,"Speculation is growing around Sam Bankman-Fried potentially receiving a presidential pardon following his conviction for fraud and money laundering. The former FTX founder, sentenced to 25 years in prison, has become the center of heated debates due to his substantial political donations and the leniency of his sentence compared to the scale of his crimes. In 2020, when FTX was at its peak, Bankman-Fried donated $5.2 million to pro-Biden super PACs, becoming the second-largest individual donor to the Democratic Party after Michael Bloomberg. Historical cases show parallels, such as Marc Rich, who was pardoned by Bill Clinton after his ex-wife made significant donations to the Democratic National Committee, and Paul Pogue, who received clemency from Donald Trump following large campaign contributions from his family. The debate intensified after Elon Musk suggested on social media that a pardon for Bankman-Fried is a tangible possibility. Prediction platform Kalshi even estimates a 12% chance of Biden granting clemency. This comes after President Biden recently pardoned Michael Conahan, who was implicated in the notorious “kids-for-cash” scandal. These decisions have raised concerns about whether political donations are influencing high-profile pardons. Another layer of controversy stems from the campaign finance violation charges against Bankman-Fried, which were dropped due to his extradition agreement with the Bahamas. Originally, he faced multiple charges, including conspiracy to violate campaign finance laws. However, these charges were excluded because the Bahamian government did not consent to their inclusion in the extradition process. Although prosecutors initially planned a separate trial for these charges, they later decided not to proceed, stating the evidence would duplicate that of the first trial. Bankman-Fried's sentencing to 25 years for orchestrating one of the largest financial frauds in history is seen by many as surprisingly lenient . FTX’s collapse resulted in over $16 billion in customer and creditor losses and wiped out more than $100 billion from the crypto market. Prosecutors had initially sought a 50-year sentence, highlighting the enormous financial damage and the erosion of public trust in the cryptocurrency industry. Meanwhile, key figures in the scandal, such as Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang, received significantly lighter consequences due to their cooperation with authorities. Critics argue that Bankman-Fried’s political donations and connections might pave the way for preferential treatment. Prominent lawyer Richard W. Painter warned that any president granting clemency under such circumstances should face impeachment. The ethical dilemma surrounding presidential pardons is not new, but Bankman-Fried’s case brings it sharply into focus, particularly given the sheer scale of his financial misconduct. Despite these discussions, it’s important to note that a presidential pardon is far from guaranteed . While past cases suggest a pattern of influential donors receiving clemency, proving a direct link between donations and pardons remains difficult. Presidents often justify such decisions on various grounds, and motivations can be complex and opaque. The crypto community remains divided. Some believe Bankman-Fried’s political influence could secure his early release, while others argue that the public scrutiny surrounding his case makes a pardon highly unlikely.

Here’s Average Amount Held by XRP Holders,"As 2024 ends soon, we decided to delve into some important XRP statistics to provide crucial insight into the digital asset’s investment landscape. Recent data from rich-list.info highlights the distribution of XRP across accounts, shedding light on the asset’s ownership. As of the latest analysis, there are 5,767,344 XRP accounts, collectively holding 61,9 billion XRP. This brings the average balance per account to 10,741.25 XRP. Distribution Insights The distribution remains concentrated among a relatively small number of high-balance accounts. For instance, only 6 accounts hold over 1 billion XRP, totaling 7.89 billion XRP. There are 22 accounts with balances between 500 million and 1 billion XRP, holding a combined 11.79 billion XRP. Accounts with balances between 100 million and 500 million XRP are 57, with a cumulative balance of 11.8 billion XRP. In contrast, smaller accounts dominate the lower ranges. 2.45 million accounts hold between 20 and 500 XRP, collectively accounting for only 189.29 million XRP. 2.21 million accounts hold less than 20 XRP, with a combined balance of 23.92 million XRP. These figures show a pronounced disparity in XRP holdings, with the largest accounts owning the majority of the total supply. Whales are not new in the XRP ecosystem, but this data shows the concentration of massive amounts of XRP among just a few investors. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Current Market Performance With XRP currently trading at $2.29, the average account balance of 10,741.25 XRP translates to approximately $24,597.46. This valuation shows how even average XRP holders have thousands of dollars. This distribution reflects broader trends within the cryptocurrency space, where whales exert significant influence. For XRP investors, understanding these dynamics is critical, as the concentration of holdings may impact liquidity, price stability, and more. This distribution also shows the growth in the market over the past few months. A similar analysis in late August showed the average XRP holder at 12,350.86 XRP. Although the average amount of tokens held has dropped slightly, the current value is more than three times the valuation of $7,214.13 from August, and the lower XRP amount can be explained by investors taking profits during the recent price rally. The XRP ecosystem continues to grow, with millions of accounts participating. With notable developments like the recent launch of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin , the ecosystem’s growth is expected to accelerate.

It’s a market filled with excitement, community power, and yes, massive volatility! Whether you’re in it for the fun or eyeing some quick gains, there’s always a meme coin that’s caught your attention. But hey, if you’re looking for the best new meme coins to join for short-term gains, you’re in the right place. With so many new players entering the scene, it’s a tough choice. But, there’s one coin that’s standing out right now — BTFD Coin. The presale has been nothing short of amazing (raising over $4.5 million so far), and here’s the kicker — there’s a 50% offer going on right now! Thanks to the BIG50 bonus code, you can snag more BTFD tokens at today’s price. And what better time than now, as we’re drawing inspiration from the 1973 oil market crash, which left its mark on the financial world and gave birth to many opportunities. Let’s dive into the coins that could potentially bring those short-term gains you’re after — from BTFD Coin to Bonk’s ‘BURNmas’ to the SPX6900 dip. BTFD Coin: The December Star BTFD Coin is proving to be the star of the show in 2024, and it’s not just about the memes. It’s all about community, staking rewards, and a super fun Play-to-Earn game . If you’ve ever thought that meme coins were just about a viral moment and didn’t have any real potential, think again. BTFD Coin is the meme coin that’s about to flip the script on what you can expect from this genre. With features like high-stakes APY and a game that rewards players with BTFD tokens, this is one meme coin that’ll keep on giving. But here’s the cool part: It’s still in presale, which means you’ve got the chance to get in early at a super-low price. And thanks to the BIG50 bonus code, you can take advantage of 50% additional tokens on your BTFD purchases. Back in 1973, the oil market saw a massive downturn, but that didn’t stop savvy investors from jumping on opportunities — and that’s exactly what you can do now with BTFD Coin. The market crash birthed investment opportunities that left many with great returns, and this is the 1973 mindset — buy the dip, and watch your rewards grow. If you decide to invest $1,000 at the current presale price of $0.00013, you’ll snag yourself 7,692,307 $BTFD tokens. But wait—here’s where it gets even better: by using the BIG50 code, you’ll get 50% more tokens! That’s an additional 3,846,153 tokens, bringing your total to 11,538,460 $BTFD tokens for your $1,000 investment. Now, let’s talk about future potential. If the price of BTFD Coin hits $0.0006 (which analysts are eyeing as a reasonable target), your $1,000 investment could grow to $6,923. Bonk’s ‘BURNmas’: A Community-Driven Event with Big Potential BonkDAO, the meme coin that’s had crypto enthusiasts on their toes for a while now, is making waves again. This time, it’s with an event called ‘BURNmas’, where BonkDAO has announced plans to burn 1.69 trillion BONK tokens — worth around $54.52 million. Yes, you read that right. This move aims to reduce the circulating supply, making the token more scarce, and possibly influencing the market dynamics. So, what does that mean for BONK? Well, burning such a large portion of tokens could lead to a short-term price surge. And history tells us that when BonkDAO executed a similar burn back in July 2024, the price jumped by 25% in just a day. For those looking for the best new meme coins to join for short-term gains, Bonk could be the one to keep an eye on. At the time of writing, Bonk is trading at $0.0000330, but with the BURNmas event in the pipeline, it might just give investors a chance to snag some gains. As always, it’s important to keep an eye on the market for any fluctuations or surprises. SPX6900: A 5% Dip in the Market, But Is It Just a Temp Blip? SPX6900, another meme coin on the radar, has been feeling the heat lately with a 5% dip over the last 24 hours. The price is sitting at $0.799299, with a market cap of $744 million. While this coin is showing some potential, the recent dip is certainly something to consider if you’re looking to get in and out for short-term profits. That being said, SPX6900 still has a solid following and community behind it, which could see it recover from this dip. If you’re on the lookout for the best new meme coins to join for short-term plays, SPX6900 could be worth a closer look, especially if the price continues to dip further and you’re ready to take advantage of a potential bounce. How to Get In on the BTFD Coin Presale with 50% More Tokens Here’s a simple guide to purchasing BTFD Coin with the BIG50 offer: Go to the Presale Page: Head over to BTFD’s Buy Now page . Connect Your Wallet: Click on “Connect Wallet” and choose your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.). Enter the Bonus Code: In the bonus code field, enter BIG50 and click “Apply”. Enter Purchase Details: Input how much $BTFD you want to buy and check the additional tokens added. Confirm and Buy: Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

38176023,https://coinpaper.com/6727/strive-aims-to-launch-bitcoin-bond-etf-amid-rising-crypto-adoption,1735290000,Strive Aims to Launch Bitcoin Bond ETF Amid Rising Crypto Adoption,"Strive Asset Management has filed for regulatory approval to launch a Bitcoin Bond ETF, aimed at providing investors exposure to convertible securities tied to Bitcoin, while private Bitcoin transactions facilitated by CoinJoin have tripled since 2022, driven by large-scale accumulators and institutional demand. Strive Asset Manager Seeks Approval for Bitcoin Bond ETF Amid Trump’s Pro-Crypto Presidency Strive Asset Management, founded by biotech entrepreneur and Trump ally Vivek Ramaswamy, has submitted a regulatory filing to launch a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) targeting Bitcoin-related convertible bonds. The proposed Strive Bitcoin Bond ETF would provide investors with exposure to “Bitcoin Bonds,” convertible securities issued by companies like MicroStrategy and others that allocate significant capital to Bitcoin purchases. The ETF aims to actively manage investments in Bitcoin Bonds, either directly or through derivatives such as swaps and options, according to the Dec. 26 filing . Strive has not yet disclosed the management fees, though actively managed funds typically carry higher costs than passive alternatives. The initiative builds upon MicroStrategy’s groundbreaking approach to corporate treasury management. Since 2020, the business intelligence firm has invested approximately $27 billion in Bitcoin, leveraging convertible bonds and stock issuances to fund its purchases. This strategy, spearheaded by MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor, has transformed the company into a de facto Bitcoin holding entity, with its stock (MSTR) appreciating over 2,200%, surpassing most publicly traded companies except Nvidia. MicroStrategy’s success has inspired a wave of corporate adoption. As of late 2024, corporate treasuries collectively hold roughly $56 billion in Bitcoin, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net . This growing trend suggests an increasing institutionalization of Bitcoin within the financial ecosystem, further bolstered by Strive’s ETF proposal. The timing of Strive’s filing is noteworthy, coinciding with a significant shift in US regulatory and political landscapes. President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance has reignited optimism for the cryptocurrency industry. Trump , who secured the presidency in November 2024, has signaled strong support for blockchain innovation and digital assets. In December, Trump announced key appointments to advance this agenda, including former PayPal COO David Sacks as his “AI and crypto czar” and Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, as his choice to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission. These appointments suggest that Trump has intentions of fostering a regulatory environment conducive to crypto industry growth. Moreover, the President-elect’s victory has reinvigorated the ETF market, with more than half a dozen cryptocurrency ETFs awaiting regulatory approval. These filings include products tied to leading altcoins like Solana (SOL), XRP, and Litecoin (LTC), signaling broader diversification in crypto financial products. Vivek Ramaswamy’s Strategic Vision Strive’s venture into Bitcoin Bonds aligns with Ramaswamy’s broader vision of leveraging capitalism to drive innovation and efficiency. Founded in 2022, Strive Asset Management has positioned itself as a forward-thinking player in the financial sector. While Ramaswamy briefly campaigned against Trump during the Republican presidential primaries, his subsequent endorsement and collaboration with the President-elect highlight shared values around economic innovation. Ramaswamy’s participation in initiatives like the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), alongside Elon Musk, further demonstrate his commitment to streamlining operations and fostering growth in emerging sectors like cryptocurrency. Analysts suggest that his leadership could accelerate the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin Bonds and similar financial products. Industry experts view Strive’s ETF filing as a potential game-changer for Bitcoin-related investments. Nate Geraci, a prominent ETF analyst, described the proposed ETF as a critical step in offering retail and institutional investors greater access to Bitcoin’s growth potential. The move also raises questions about the broader implications of convertible bonds in Bitcoin's market dynamics. Unlike traditional bonds, convertible bonds offer the flexibility to convert into equity, providing investors with upside exposure to a company’s performance. For MicroStrategy, this has meant offering low- or no-interest bonds to fund Bitcoin purchases, effectively aligning its corporate growth with Bitcoin's valuation trajectory. As Bitcoin continues to mature as an asset class, products like the Strive Bitcoin Bond ETF could play a pivotal role in bridging traditional finance and the cryptocurrency market. By providing managed exposure to Bitcoin-related convertible bonds, the ETF offers a novel way for investors to capitalize on Bitcoin's potential while diversifying their portfolios. With Trump’s pro-crypto administration poised to redefine the regulatory landscape, Strive’s timing may prove fortuitous. The convergence of innovative financial products, corporate adoption, and favorable political conditions marks a new era for cryptocurrency investment strategies. Privacy Transactions Triple as Bitcoin Whales Accelerate Accumulation Meanwhile, the use of private Bitcoin transactions, enabled through processes like CoinJoin, has surged dramatically, tripling since 2022, according to a report by CryptoQuant. This increase is due to the growing activity of Bitcoin “whales” — large holders and accumulators — as they bolster their holdings amid rising institutional interest and adoption of Bitcoin-related financial products. These whales, identified primarily as being linked to spot Bitcoin ETFs, MicroStrategy, and custodial wallets, have increasingly turned to privacy-centric tools like CoinJoin to anonymize their transactions, according to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju. In a post on Dec. 26, Young Ju explained that these high-net-worth Bitcoin holders frequently use privacy features to obfuscate transfers, especially when moving funds to institutional investors. CoinJoin, a privacy-enhancing method in Bitcoin transactions, pools inputs and outputs from multiple users. This process creates a layer of anonymity by making it nearly impossible to determine who owns the resulting unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). This increased privacy appeals to both individual and institutional Bitcoin holders seeking discretion. Critics have argued that CoinJoin could be a tool for illicit activity, but Young Ju countered this notion by pointing out that only 0.5% of Bitcoin’s $377 billion in realized capital inflows in 2024 were tied to illicit activities, as reported by Chainalysis . These findings challenge the perception that privacy tools are predominantly used for money laundering or other illegal activities. The surge in private transactions correlates with a growing appetite for Bitcoin among institutions. Entities such as MicroStrategy, which has pioneered corporate Bitcoin adoption, and Bitcoin ETFs, have significantly increased their holdings. MicroStrategy alone has purchased over $27 billion worth of Bitcoin since 2020, largely funded by convertible bonds and stock offerings. Publicly disclosed Bitcoin holdings account for a significant portion of institutional adoption, but Young Ju highlighted an intriguing subset of unidentified whales. These entities are estimated to hold approximately 420,000 Bitcoin — worth over $40 billion at current prices. “Who are these whales?” Young Ju pondered in his post, sparking speculation among analysts and the broader crypto community. The identity of these massive accumulators has become a hot topic. Some industry commentators suggest that a nation-state could be quietly amassing a Bitcoin reserve to hedge against traditional financial risks or sanctions. Others believe that a sanctioned country, such as Russia, could be leveraging Bitcoin as a tool to bypass international restrictions. Russia recently enacted legislation permitting foreign trade settlements in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, fueling theories about its potential involvement. If true, such a development could signify a paradigm shift in the geopolitical role of digital assets. Regulatory Scrutiny of Privacy Tools Despite their legitimate uses, privacy-focused tools like CoinJoin have drawn increased attention from regulators and law enforcement agencies worldwide. In April 2024, US authorities arrested the founders of Samourai Wallet, a non-custodial Bitcoin service offering CoinJoin functionality, and seized its website. The Department of Justice alleged that Samourai facilitated over $2 billion in unlawful transactions, including $100 million in money laundering linked to dark web markets like Silk Road and Hydra Market. Similarly, Dutch authorities prosecuted Alexey Pertsev, the creator of Tornado Cash, a popular Ethereum-based mixing tool. Pertsev was found guilty of money laundering in May 2024. These cases bring attention to the delicate balance regulators must maintain between safeguarding financial privacy and curbing illicit activity. Privacy tools like CoinJoin have become indispensable for Bitcoin users seeking discretion, particularly in an era of heightened institutional involvement. However, their potential for misuse has raised alarm bells, prompting global authorities to increase scrutiny and enforcement actions against service providers. The broader crypto community remains divided on the future of privacy in the blockchain ecosystem. Proponents argue that privacy is a fundamental right and essential for Bitcoin’s utility as a decentralized, peer-to-peer currency. Critics, on the other hand, contend that unchecked anonymity could undermine the legitimacy of the digital asset market. The tripling of CoinJoin transactions signals not only an evolving approach to Bitcoin adoption but also a growing sophistication among its largest stakeholders. As institutional interest continues to rise, so too will the demand for tools that enhance transaction privacy. At the same time, regulatory clarity and enforcement will shape the boundaries of how such tools are used. Whether driven by institutional accumulation, speculative investments, or geopolitical strategies, the increasing use of privacy transactions reflects Bitcoin’s transformation from a fringe asset into a mainstream financial instrument. With its role in global finance continuing to expand, Bitcoin’s story is far from over — and the rising activity of whales suggests that its next chapter will be one of even greater intrigue and complexity.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6727/strive-aims-to-launch-bitcoin-bond-etf-amid-rising-crypto-adoption,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

38176187,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633787,1735289910,South Korean stocks lean on Trump and AI amid political disaster,"South Korea’s stock market is in free fall. It’s chaos out there, and no one knows where the bottom is. The Kospi, the nation’s flagship index, is on its longest losing streak since 2008, plummeting over 8% in 2024. Compare that to a global rally of 18%, and you’ve got a mess big enough to scare off investors in droves. Political instability and market missteps have turned South Korea into a bad joke for equity traders. If that weren’t enough, Donald Trump’s second term has made everything worse. He’s reviving tariff threats on tech exports, spooking the same companies South Korea relies on for growth. The artificial intelligence boom? It’s skipping over South Korea. Samsung Electronics, the country’s pride and joy, is limping along after a 32% stock slide. The company, once a leader in AI innovation, is now playing catch-up. Investors have sold $7 billion worth of Samsung stock this year alone. The surprising bright spots There’s some good news if you squint. Power equipment stocks are riding high. HD Hyundai Electric Co., a relatively obscure player before 2024, became a star with a jaw-dropping 370% gain. Why? AI data centers need more electricity, and Hyundai Electric is cashing in big time. Meanwhile, Samyang Foods is proving that TikTok isn’t just for teenagers and dance challenges. The company’s spicy Buldak noodles went viral in the U.S., pushing its stock up by 250%. The noodles are burning taste buds and filling wallets, making Samyang Foods one of the most talked-about names in South Korea’s market. Some analysts think there’s still more upside for this quirky food company. Banks, too, are having a moment. KB Financial Group Inc., South Korea’s banking juggernaut, is up nearly 60% this year. That’s its best performance since 2009, driven by the government’s “Corporate Value-Up” campaign. The initiative is supposed to reform corporate governance and increase shareholder returns, and the banks are quick to jump on board. At least someone’s getting something right. Samsung and EV batteries tank under pressure Not every sector is winning. Samsung’s collapse has been brutal. The company is struggling to keep up with AI-focused rivals , especially in memory chips tailored for AI processors. Investors had high hopes for Samsung’s partnership with Nvidia, but those dreams fizzled fast. Now Samsung’s being left in the dust by SK Hynix, whose shares are up more than 20% this year. And don’t even get started on electric vehicle battery makers. It’s been a bloodbath. Samsung SDI, Posco Holdings, and LG Chem are all down about 50%, while Ecopro BM, a smaller player, has lost over 60% of its value. Blame Trump again—his promise to repeal the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act has killed incentives for EV purchases, gutting demand. Retail investors, once obsessed with this sector, are nowhere to be found. The future isn’t all bleak, though. The EU is rolling out stricter emissions policies, and there’s talks about industry consolidation. Cheaper EV models might also help revive interest next year. But for now, this sector is in shambles. Political chaos fuels investor panic South Korea has managed to impeach two leaders in one month. President Yoon Suk Yeol was removed after declaring martial law for six hours in December, a decision so extreme it shocked even his supporters. He justified it by claiming it was necessary to “protect the constitutional order,” but the backlash was immediate. Opposition lawmakers wasted no time impeaching him. Then came the downfall of acting President Han Duck-soo. Lawmakers booted him for dragging his feet on appointing Constitutional Court justices. The court is now tasked with deciding whether to reinstate Yoon or make his impeachment permanent. This political circus has shaken South Korea’s reputation as a stable democracy. Investors are nervous, and the Korean won has taken a hit, dropping 0.40% against the dollar to 1,472.22 after Han’s impeachment. The “Corporate Value-Up” reforms, one of the few things keeping investors somewhat hopeful, now look like they’re running on fumes. Without strong political backing, it’s unclear how far these changes can go. As if things weren’t bad enough, South Korea now has to deal with China’s aggressive stimulus measures. Beijing is pumping money into its economy, offering investors shiny new opportunities. South Korea, by contrast, is looking like a sinking ship. Capital outflows are accelerating as global investors chase better returns elsewhere.

38177534,https://invezz.com/?p=2407213,1735289859,Injective and Aethir launch world’s first tokenized GPU marketplace,"Injective, the layer-1 blockchain for everything finance, is teaming up with the decentralized cloud compute infrastructure platform Aethir to tokenize GPU resources. The initiative aims at the intersection of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. In an announcement , Injective and Aethir said the collaboration targets making accessibility to decentralized computing power cost-effective as they power the next development phase of AI and blockchain. Injective and Aethir deal One of the key benefits of this integration is that developers and researchers can tap into their computing power by converting this into tokens on Injective. This tokenization has multiple benefits for the user community. By leveraging Injective’s blockchain infrastructure, projects can integrate tokenized GPUs into their decentralized finance ecosystems to allow for trading, staking, and collateralization among others. More importantly, developers, researchers, and institutions will have the opportunity to leverage GPU resources without having to make huge, upfront investments in hardware. What this means is that developers can purchase the exact computing power their projects need. In doing so, they will be benefiting from both affordable high-performance GPUs as well as avoiding unnecessary costs on GPU compute. Aethir and Injective’s GPU tokenization push overall brings significant gains in terms of pioneering fractional ownership, utility and composability, and real-time resource trading for the rapidly expanding marketplace. Smart contract integration and access from anywhere across the globe are also notable features. The collaboration will tap into Aethir’s infrastructure which includes more than 360,000 GPUs, over 3,000 NVIDIA H100s, and 32,000 Edge cloud nodes distributed globally. Growth across AI and crypto Injective’s collaboration with Aethir comes as the tokenization industry records significant traction . This growth in the real-world assets tokenization space also coincides with an explosion in the AI agent market. In November, Injective released a new software development kit that allows users to create their own AI agents. The L1 then teamed up with Solana Virtual Machine layer-2 Sonic in December to launch the industry’s first cross-chain AI agent platform. Meanwhile, Aethir is also pushing for further adoption across the AI and blockchain marketplaces. Recently, the platform announced a joint venture that brings together Beam Foundation, Aethir, and MetaStreet – a partnership aimed at bolstering AI and crypto-focused projects. Tactical Compute (TACOM) is the initiative these partners are looking to use to highlight these projects, providing up to $40 million in AI compute support.

38175806,https://coinpaprika.com/news/vivek-ramaswamy-s-strive-files-for-bitcoin-bond-etf-with-sec,1735289529,Vivek Ramaswamy’s Strive Files for Bitcoin Bond ETF with SEC,"Strive, the asset management firm founded by Vivek Ramaswamy , has filed an application with the SEC to launch a Bitcoin Bond ETF. The proposed ETF aims to invest in convertible bonds issued by companies like MicroStrategy , which use the funds raised from these bonds to purchase Bitcoin. The filing, submitted on December 26, outlines Strive's strategy to actively manage the ETF using direct investments in these bonds or financial tools like swaps and options. MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, has been aggressively accumulating Bitcoin throughout 2024. In December alone, the company purchased over $4 billion worth of BTC, increasing its total Bitcoin holdings significantly. This aggressive strategy has had a direct impact on MicroStrategy's stock price, which has surged nearly 400% this year. The company's stock has also been added to the Nasdaq-100 index, with potential inclusion in the S&P 500 next year. MicroStrategy funds these large Bitcoin acquisitions primarily by issuing shares and convertible bonds, which often carry little to no interest and can be converted into company stock. According to ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the proposed ETF essentially mirrors MicroStrategy's convertible bond strategy until other companies adopt similar practices. The financial product is expected to appeal to investors seeking indirect exposure to Bitcoin without holding the cryptocurrency directly. Strive’s initiative comes at a time when Bitcoin-related investment products are gaining traction , especially after the SEC approved the first-ever dual Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs earlier this month from Hashdex and Franklin Templeton. The growing demand for Bitcoin exposure among retail investors continues to drive innovative financial products. Vivek Ramaswamy, a well-known Republican figure, co-founded Strive in 2022 and has been active in promoting financial independence from large institutional investors. In addition to his financial ventures, he has been involved in initiatives like the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which aims to reduce unnecessary government spending. MicroStrategy's ongoing Bitcoin acquisition strategy highlights the appeal of a Bitcoin Bond ETF. The company has invested over $27 billion in Bitcoin since 2020, which has caused its stock price to skyrocket by more than 2,200%. This trend reflects a broader market sentiment where investors see Bitcoin as a strategic long-term asset. Strive's ETF would allow retail investors to tap into this growth indirectly while minimizing some of the risks associated with direct cryptocurrency ownership. Meanwhile, industry experts anticipate further crypto ETF approvals if favorable policies emerge under a potential Trump administration. This optimism stems from growing acceptance of Bitcoin among regulators and traditional financial institutions. Some analysts even suggest that a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the US could become a reality sooner than expected. Popular crypto influencer, The Bitcoin Therapist, recently expressed confidence in Vivek Ramaswamy's ETF proposal, stating that ongoing developments indicate significant changes in the US's approach to Bitcoin. According to him, movements are already underway that could lead to broader adoption of Bitcoin-based financial products on a national level. The concept of a Bitcoin Bond ETF is particularly appealing because it provides exposure not just to Bitcoin, but also to the financial strategies of companies like MicroStrategy. Investors can potentially benefit from the growth in Bitcoin prices and the stock performance of these companies without directly purchasing or holding Bitcoin. Strive's ETF application reflects a larger shift in the financial sector towards Bitcoin-based financial instruments. As Bitcoin's adoption grows and traditional finance integrates cryptocurrency more deeply, products like the Bitcoin Bond ETF could become essential tools for investors seeking diversified exposure to the growing digital asset market.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/vivek-ramaswamy-s-strive-files-for-bitcoin-bond-etf-with-sec,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/38175806.jpeg

The merger, revealed on December 26, represents a significant step towards streamlining its platform’s functionalities. This consolidation has contributed to BGB reaching an all-time high of $7.79, highlighting its growth amid a broader downturn in the cryptocurrency market. The token’s market cap has soared to over $10.3 billion, with a remarkable 30% increase in value today and over 350% gains in December. In contrast, other major cryptocurrencies, like BNB, rose by just 13% this month, and Bitcoin fell below $95,000 after briefly surpassing $100,000 earlier in December. The newly unified BGB token will support various features, including powering the Fair Launchpool and serving as a medium for gas fee payments. Bitget plans to integrate BGB into public blockchain systems and DeFi platforms, positioning it as a core asset for staking and lending . These developments further establish BGB as a leading token in the centralized exchange (CEX) space, with its market cap increasing by over 750% in 2024, making it the best-performing CEX token of the year. According to Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget, merging the two tokens marks a pivotal step toward creating a comprehensive ecosystem that connects on-chain and off-chain applications. The total supply of BGB will remain unchanged, with an exchange rate of 11.68 BWB for 1 BGB. Bitget will cease all BWB-related services on December 27 as part of the transition. Bitget has made substantial strides in global expansion throughout 2024. Now ranked as the fifth-largest centralized exchange by daily trading volume, the platform has ambitious plans for 2025. These include entering new markets and setting up an EU hub in Lithuania to align with MiCA regulations. This move will facilitate more efficient expansion into European markets . Additionally, Bitget is actively pursuing regulatory approvals in 15 countries and has already obtained licenses in several EU nations. Notably, the company is considering a US market entry if pro-crypto legislation advances under the incoming Trump administration. Licensing barriers previously hindered its access to the world’s largest crypto market. However, challenges remain in markets like Japan. In November, Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) warned Bitget and other platforms, including KuCoin and Bybit, for operating without proper registration. Bitget’s rapid growth, marked by innovations like the token merger, solidifies its position as a key player in the crypto industry. The unification of BGB and BWB signals the company’s commitment to building a robust and integrated ecosystem.",POSITIVE,BGB,ASIA | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BGB | ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/bitget-merges-tokens-as-bgb-hits-record-high-amid-market-downturn,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/38175597.jpeg

38175465,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398777,1735288888,Dogecoin Price Prediction 2025: Decoding the Possibility of Reaching $1,"The post Dogecoin Price Prediction 2025: Decoding the Possibility of Reaching $1 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Dogecoin bulls have entered a soothing phase as the volume remains grounded, due to which the price has begun to trade within a horizontal consolidation. The DOGE price lost a key support level at $0.34 and hence reclaiming these levels has become more important for the rally. The price faced a 60% pullback from the highs over $0.22 during the end of Q1. Therefore, if the pattern repeats, the Dogecoin price is expected to close the yearly trade on a bearish note, probably plunging below $0.2. Dogecoin Faces Crucial Levels: Potential Pullback or Breakout to $0.7 in 2025 The DOGE price initiated the 2024 trade with a massive upswing, gaining over 150% value after a horizontal consolidation for over a month. Interestingly, the token is repeating the same pattern and hence the fear of a 40% pullback haunts the DOGE price rally. The price is currently stuck within an ascending triangle after rising from a prolonged consolidation, similar to before, and is about to test the ascending trend line. Now that the Dogecoin price rally has landed into a decisive phase, here’s what to expect in 2025. As mentioned earlier, the token is approaching crucial levels that appear to be pretty decisive at the moment. The price has not broken the ascending trend line, which has been a strong support and hence keeps up the possibility of a healthy upswing. If this trade materializes, then the price is expected to trade along the rising trend line and reach the apex, followed by a breakout to the important resistance at $0.7. 2025 Dogecoin Outlook: Rally to $1 Possible After Q1 2025 Resistance Break On the other hand, if the price repeats it’s previous trend, then the price is feared to drop below $0.25 and remain consolidated around the range for a while. Unfortunately, the technicals are displaying a similar trend which suggests a pullback could be imminent. Regardless of the growing bearish pressure, the Dogecoin (DOGE) price remains primed to trigger a healthy rebound and revive an ascending trend to reach the crucial barrier at $0.7 during Q1 2025. After securing these levels by withstanding the bearish pressures, the DOGE price could eventually head towards $1 in late 2025, marking the peak of the ongoing bull run. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Or Is It Possible?","Cryptocurrency markets are rife with speculation, and Bitcoin is no exception. Analyst Ali Martinez recently outlined a series of bearish predictions for Bitcoin’s price, echoing the concerns of several leading analysts. While some remain bullish on the long-term prospects of the largest cryptocurrency, short-term forecasts paint a potentially significant bearish picture. Many analysts have expressed concerns about Bitcoin’s recent price action. Tone Vays suggests that trading below $95,000 is a very negative sign, increasing the possibility of a correction to $73,000. Peter Brandt echoes this sentiment, pointing to a potential “expanding triangle” formation that could lead to a pullback to $70,000. Mark Newton is predicting an even steeper drop to $60,000, while Benjamin Cowen suggests a potential “flash crash” to the same level, which he says could coincide with Donald Trump’s potential inauguration. Related News: Are We in a Bull Market in Bitcoin, or Is It All a Bubble? Analysis Company Founder Shares This bearish trend appears to be supported by on-chain data, with Martinez noting that there is little support below $93,806 down to $70,085. Adding to the concerns, over 33,000 Bitcoin worth over $3.23 billion has flowed into exchanges over the past week, potentially signaling a sell-off. The profit-taking trend has also been evident, with over $7.17 billion worth of Bitcoin profits made on December 23 alone. Further reinforcing this trend, the percentage of long positions on Binance has decreased significantly, from 66.73% to 53.60%. Despite the prevailing bearish trend, some analysts remain bullish in the long term, with Tom Lee, for example, predicting that Bitcoin will reach $250,000 by 2025. Martinez highlights a key technical level for Bitcoin: the $97,300 support zone. He argues that Bitcoin needs to reclaim this level and, most importantly, make a daily close above $100,000 to invalidate the bearish view. If that happens, Martinez believes a new uptrend could push Bitcoin toward $168,500. *This is not investment advice.

38175530,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633780,1735288694,"Bitcoin dominance collapses to zero on TradingView, debunked as glitch","Bitcoin faced significant price turbulence on December 26, disrupting the typically calm trading conditions seen during the holiday period. A glitch in TradingView’s chart erroneously displayed Bitcoin crypto market dominance as 0%, triggering panic among traders and market participants. Social media reports highlighted a sharp price decline, with Bitcoin momentarily falling by 4.8% to trade near $95,000. However, the anomaly was short-lived, as it has now corrected to 58.97%. One user on X drew attention to the issue, remarking, “Bitcoin Dominance Collapses to Zero on TradingView! It appears to have been a temporary drop, as dominance has now recovered.” Bitcoin price fluctuations caused by panic sales After Bitcoin’s price experienced a downturn fueled by market panic, it settled into a narrow range between $95,000 and $96,000. Data from CoinGlass revealed that roughly $33 million worth of long Bitcoin positions were liquidated within four hours during the event. In the last 24 hours, there has been a total of $57.46 million in liquidations, which means the selling spree dropped when the glitch was fixed. Crypto market liquidations: Source – CoinGlass Market analysts highlighted the cascading effects of the TradingView glitch. Marc Bernegger, co-founder of crypto fund AltAlpha Digital, stated that the error contributed to trader panic and subsequent volatility. “The latest fluctuations in Bitcoin price, dropping to around $95,000 from near $100,000, appear to have been influenced by a glitch on TradingView,” Bernegger commented. He believes the misrepresentation of Bitcoin’s dominance at 0% led to market uncertainty and the liquidation of significant long positions. Another analyst, Lin, echoed similar sentiments, adding emphasis to the compounded effects of the glitch, among other reasons. “The panic selling from the technical error into a low liquidity environment, amplified by strategic profit-taking and institutional movements of $338 million in Bitcoin ETF outflows on Christmas Eve, are the most likely catalysts for the retreat in the last 24 hours,” Lin noted. Bitcoin dominance and ETF dynamics Looking at the charts, the leading cryptocurrency by market cap had been trading at $96,268.32 before the event but has now dropped to $95,300, reflecting a 2.54% drop over 24 hours and a 2.72% decline over the past week. BTC Price movement: Source TradingView Analysts have observed consolidation on the charts, with Bitcoin facing strong resistance at $97,000 and critical support near $94,700. Relative Strength Index (RSI) levels hovered near neutral, suggesting the coin is building a balanced momentum. BTC’s market dominance has been a focal point for traders in recent weeks as it fluctuated near critical levels. In mid-November, dominance briefly surpassed 61.5% before reversing. This reversal renewed hopes among some analysts for an “alt season,” a period when altcoins outperform BTC. A trading account on X, Aqua, denoted the market sentiment: “BTC Dominance reached the 2021 breakdown level and rejected. I think BTC Dominance peaked, and ALTs will start outperforming $BTC in the coming months. Finally, we will see the true ALTs season soon.” Meanwhile, US spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced a resurgence in positive inflows post-Christmas day, totaling $475 million. This brought cumulative net inflows to $35.96 billion, signaling renewed investor interest. Thursday, 12/26: US spot Bitcoin ETFs, back to positive inflows of $475M, cumulative net inflow up to $35.96B, ETFs with most inflows were $FBTC ($254M) & $ARBK ($186.9M), Blackrock $IBIT investors were also buying again with inflows of $56.5M, BTC ETF investors buying the dip pic.twitter.com/sc6lCz6Whh — Bitcoin Insights (@BitcoinInsight1) December 27, 2024 Among the top-performing ETFs , FBTC led with $254 million in inflows, followed by ARBK with $186.9 million.

The contribution, valued at approximately $292,000, was made to Thailand's Khao Kheow Open Zoo, where the beloved animal resides. Moo Deng gained worldwide fame after her photos went viral on social media when she was just two months old. Shared on the zoo’s official Facebook page, the images sparked massive interest, doubling the zoo’s daily visitors in September 2024. The hype even led to merchandise featuring Moo Deng, further boosting the zoo’s visibility. Buterin expressed his excitement on X (formerly Twitter), saying he was proud to support Moo Deng and set aside 10 million THB ($292,000) for her care , hinting at possible future donations. In response to Moo Deng's viral fame, the MOODENG meme coin was launched, with its creator donating over 10 billion tokens to Buterin. However, Buterin sold these tokens, clarifying that the proceeds would be directed towards charitable causes. Following Buterin’s ETH donation, the MOODENG token’s value skyrocketed, surging over 70% in 24 hours and marking a 125% increase throughout the week. This surge illustrates the potential of meme coins to drive positive change , despite their often-speculative nature. Buterin has long championed the idea of using cryptocurrencies, including meme tokens, to create meaningful social impact. His recent donation reinforces the potential of decentralized financial tools to support global causes. Another example of the charitable power of meme coins is the MIRA token. Earlier this year, Siqi Chen, the founder of Runway, revealed that his daughter Mira was diagnosed with a rare brain tumor. While the tumor was benign, its critical location made treatment challenging. Moved by the story, an X user named Waddles launched the MIRA meme coin on Solana, pledging half of its supply to Chen. In return, Chen committed to donating all proceeds from the coin to fund vital medical research. Both MOODENG and MIRA highlight how meme coins, often dismissed as speculative assets, can become powerful tools for goodwill and collective action. These cases serve as a reminder that the world of cryptocurrency isn’t just about profits—it can also create lasting positive change.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | SOL | RESEARCH,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/vitalik-buterin-donates-88-eth-to-adopt-viral-hippo-moo-deng,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/38175162.jpeg

PEPE and SUI have shed a lot of their gains in the past week, and the November 2024 surge is not looking too glamorous from this end. On the flip side, FXGuys ($FXG) holders are 33% better off in the past month, as the presale profits have yielded gains for the Stage 1 buyers. After hitting the $3 million mark in raised funding, the $FXG presale is heating up now, with investors continuing to stack up in anticipation of a 10,000% surge. Hang on for more details! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE PEPE’s Volatility Turns Investors Towards Another DeFi Coin Pepe has a track record of high volatility, especially when you consider its 150,000% price pump in 2023. However, PEPE has been fairly consistent in 2024, staying in the bullish zone and even leading surges, like shortly after the Bitcoin halving in May. November brought another PEPE rally, as the token recorded another ATH at $0.00002825 by early December. The market has brought another surprise, though, as PEPE’s recent activity has seen the token price slip to support levels last seen in September. PEPE now exchanges for $0.00001753 after losing 17.89% on the monthly timeframe. The past week has seen PEPE try to breach the $0.000020 level, but more bearish influences are keeping PEPE under. It’s no surprise that investors are opting for new crypto investment opportunities with FXGuys. The $FXG presale token has already delivered up to 33% gains in a few weeks, and that’s more than what investors got on most top altcoins in that time. FXGuys: New Crypto Boosting Traders with Funding and Profits Each new crypto project injects a fresh perspective into the cryptocurrency space, and DeFi projects like FXGuys take it to the next level. With FXGuys, the trading community is about to get a significant upgrade—and it’s not just about introducing another set of analytical tools. The FXGuys proprietary trading system is an opportunity for traders to achieve their trading potential. Often, DeFi traders face significant barriers due to limited capital, constraining their ability to aim for bigger profit margins. FX Guys breaks down this barrier. By passing a comprehensive trader assessment, traders become eligible for the Trader Funding Program. Through the FX Guys Trader Funding Program, traders can get up to $500,000 in capital, and they get to keep up to 80% of the profits. But that’s not all—the innovative Trade2Earn feature further rewards traders, enabling them to accumulate a valuable stash of $FXG tokens. The Trade2Earn feature incentivizes users with $FXG coin rewards for closing trades, essentially rewarding activity on the FXGuys platform. In simple terms, traders can seamlessly accumulate $FXG tokens while actively trading even other tokens on the platform. Furthermore, the FX Guys platform prioritizes user security, providing a safe and private experience. Notably, the new crypto project eliminates the risk of identity leaks by not requiring users to submit KYC information, ensuring anonymity and privacy. SUI to Lose Spot Trading on Binance Binance announced that it would delist five tokens from its spot trading options, no doubt because of its recent market failures. Sui was listed among the top altcoins set to leave the spot trading markets on Binance, effective December 20, 2024. Binance cited a fact that Sui and the other listed tokens haven’t met the standards for trading volume and liquidity. Reduced investor interest in the SUI token is reflected in how the DeFi coin has continued to dip. SUI lost 6% of its value following the Binance news. The delisting leaves SUI at $4.48 , some 4.42% down on the weekly charts. The market cap and trading volume have also tanked in the past 24 hours, and, like PEPE and some other top altcoins, the Sui project is seeing its token holders move over to the FXGuys ecosystem, where its DeFi coin is promising some impressive gains. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE The $FXG Presale Token: A 100x Profit Potential For New Investors! $FXG has been in presale for some weeks, and the DeFi coin has pooled over $3 million in funding. Traders and investors are all over the coin for potential returns, as the launch price is expected to be around $0.10. $FXG is currently valued at $0.04 in Stage 2 of the public presale, and the presale token price is set to grow by 150% when it goes live on major exchanges at $0.10. Furthermore, per expert analysis, $FXG could hit 100x post-launch. The demand for the coin could spike as the proprietary trading system on FXGuys gains traction, and this might be the cheapest any investor would ever get the coin. You don’t want to miss out!

This development could lead to unexpected volatility and significant opportunities for traders and investors. For Bitcoin, the total value of expiring options has reached approximately $14.38 billion, while Ethereum’s options account for about $3.7 billion. The volume of contracts expiring today is striking—88,537 Bitcoin contracts and 796,021 Ethereum contracts—several times higher than last week’s figures. Such an increase reflects heightened activity and traders’ anticipation of profit or risk mitigation. Bitcoin’s put-to-call (P/C) ratio is currently at 0.69, signaling optimism as more traders are placing bullish bets. Ethereum’s ratio has dropped to 0.41, suggesting even greater confidence in ETH prices rising . Lower P/C ratios indicate that more call options (bets on price increases) are being purchased compared to put options (bets on price declines). At present, both BTC and ETH are trading well above their respective maximum pain prices. For Bitcoin, this price is $85,000, while for Ethereum, it is $3,000. The ""maximum pain price"" represents the level at which options buyers experience the most significant losses at expiry, often leading to market adjustments as prices gravitate toward this point. David Lawant, Head of Research at FalconX, highlighted the rise in hedging sentiment as a possible reason for the upward trend in Bitcoin's P/C ratio during the last quarter of 2024. “Demand for downside protection has been rising,” he said, noting that traders may be looking to safeguard their year-end performance metrics. In October, Bitcoin’s P/C ratio for options expiring on December 27 was just 0.35 but has now doubled to over 0.70. Ethereum’s sentiment shows a contrasting trend. The P/C ratio for ETH has sharply declined from 0.97 at the end of October to its current level of 0.41, reflecting growing bullishness. This shift indicates traders’ confidence in ETH's potential to sustain or increase its price. With leveraged positions currently favoring the upside, sharp market movements could occur, especially if prices deviate significantly from expectations. Analysts suggest that this record-breaking expiry could shape the market’s narrative for 2025 , as traders await further developments with heightened anticipation. As the year comes to a close, the crypto market braces for possible price swings following today’s monumental options expiry. Investors should remain vigilant as the dynamics of these expiring contracts could define trends in the coming months.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/-18-billion-in-bitcoin-ethereum-options-expire-today-market-braces-for-big-moves,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/38174984.jpeg

38174848,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376378,1735287728,"Pi Network Updates, Shiba Inu (SHIB) Developments, and More: Bits Recap Dec 27","TL;DR The Pi Network’s Open Network launch is delayed again to January 31, 2025, disappointing users awaiting progress. Shiba Inu’s “SHIB: The Metaverse” expands its ecosystem, offering virtual real estate trading and global connectivity. Bitcoin (BTC) fell 12% from its $108,000 peak amid possible Federal Reserve policy shifts. Delays After Delays Pi Network – the controversial cryptocurrency project that claims to allow people to mine digital assets from their smartphones – continues to raise eyebrows across its community. It was launched more than five years ago, but the open mainnet and native token have yet to be introduced. Earlier this year, the team said the first huge target is the release of the Open Network. They also stated this could become possible once users pass necessary Know-Your-Customer (KYC) verifications and migrate to the mainnet (known as the Grace Period). The initial deadline for that was September 30 , while later , it was moved a few more times to December 31. Most recently, the Pi Network team announced another extension to January 31: “We’re extending both KYC and Mainnet Migration Grace Period deadlines to January 31, 2025, to help include more Pioneers and their Pi as we prepare for Open Network in Q1 2025.” Somewhat expectedly , this was not accepted well by some members of the community who have been waiting for serious developments for years. “It has been your trend of doing things. We’re not surprised. You have always lied. Those dates are not even real: delay, delay, delay, until project dies,” one frustrated user said . Shiba Inu’s Latest Project The popular meme coin recently launched a virtual world called “SHIB: The Metaverse.” The project, described as “groundbreaking” by Shibarium’s Marketing lead LUCIE, enables users to own, trade, and develop virtual real estate recorded on the blockchain. Additionally, people can build their own vision, create personalized avatars, and connect globally with other members of the SHIB community. In the past few years, Shiba Inu has introduced many other projects, thus showcasing its evolution from a meme coin to a broader ecosystem. Examples are the layer-2 scaling solution Shibarium and the blockchain-based games Shiboshi Rush and Shiba Eternity. BTC Price Condition We’ll wrap up today’s recap with some information about the primary cryptocurrency, which has experienced a substantial price decline lately . Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new all-time high of over $108,000 on December 17, but since then, it has plummeted by 12% to its current $95,000 (per CoinGecko’s data). BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko As CryptoPotato reported , the downfall started shortly after the Federal Reserve announced another 0.25% rate cut. However, the central bank’s Chairman – Jerome Powell – hinted that this policy might be paused next year due to rising inflation concerns. He also added that the Fed is not allowed to hold BTC, casting doubt on Trump’s proposed plan to establish a strategic BTC reserve in the USA. One important factor signaling that the asset’s correction might intensify in the short term is the increased exchange netflow. On December 26, the technical analyst Ali Martinez maintained that 33,000 BTC (currently valued at over $3.1 billion) had been sent to platforms in the past week. The move indicates that investors may be preparing to offload their holdings. Large sell-offs would result in increased circulating supply, which, combined with non-rising demand, could put downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price.

38175707,https://invezz.com/?p=2407126,1735287335,"‘Pig butchering’ scams cost crypto users $3.6B in 2024, report finds","In 2024, “pig butchering” scams emerged as the leading threat to cryptocurrency users, causing an estimated $3.6 billion in losses, according to Cyvers, a Web3 security firm. In 2023, this number was around $3.96 billion, as per an estimate from the FBI. What is pig butchering? The scheme is called “pig butchering” because it involves scammers “fattening up” victims, or “pigs,” before exploiting them. Scammers create fake personas, sometimes using deepfake images, to build relationships with victims through messages, social media, or dating apps. They often introduce cryptocurrency into the conversation, offering investment guidance without directly asking for money. Eventually, victims are directed to send funds to platforms controlled by the scammer, marking the start of the exploitation. Cyberattacks surge in 2024 The Cyvers report revealed a 40% increase in cyberattacks in 2024 compared to the previous year, with 165 incidents resulting in $2.3 billion in damages. Although this is 37% lower than the 2022 peak, the sophistication and variety of attack vectors intensified: Access Control Breaches: Accounted for 67 incidents, causing $1.9 billion in losses. Smart Contract Vulnerabilities: Led to 98 incidents and $456.8 million in damages. Address Poisoning Assaults: Involved a single significant case, resulting in a $68.7 million loss. Ethereum: a primary target As per the report, Ethereum remained the most exploited blockchain, with scammers using its open-access infrastructure to execute fraudulent schemes. Over 800,000 transactions and 150,000 addresses were linked to scams in 2024. Techniques included sending small inducement payments to victims as part of grooming strategies. Major crypto hacks of 2024 WazirX: $235 Million Loss WazirX, one of India’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, faced a massive hack in 2024, resulting in a loss of $235 million. The breach occurred due to a vulnerability in the platform’s multi-signature (multi-sig) wallet system. Multi-sig wallets require multiple keys for transactions, enhancing security, but the vulnerability allowed attackers to bypass this safeguard. DMM Exchange: $305 Million Loss DMM Exchange suffered a devastating attack in 2024 when its Bitcoin hot wallet was compromised. The breach occurred when attackers gained access to a private key associated with the wallet, allowing them to drain $305 million in Bitcoin. Radiant Capital: $50 Million Loss Radiant Capital, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, experienced a breach that resulted in a $50 million loss. The hack occurred when the attackers gained control of the devices used by Radiant Capital’s team to access the platform. BingX: $52 Million Loss BingX, a global crypto exchange, was drained of $52 million in 2024 following a sophisticated attack that targeted its hot wallets. Attackers exploited vulnerabilities in the platform’s security, allowing them to access the wallets and transfer funds across multiple networks. Recovery efforts show progress Despite the rising incidents, recovery efforts made notable strides in 2024. Around $1.3 billion was recovered, largely due to on-chain detectives like ZachXBT and bug bounty initiatives. The first quarter of 2024 saw the highest number of attacks, while Q3 recorded the largest financial impact, at $760 million. Q4 exhibited a decline in both activity and losses, indicating potential progress in combating these crimes.

GreenBlock (GBLK): Pioneering Sustainable Blockchain Solutions GreenBlock represents a breakthrough in environmentally conscious blockchain technology, addressing one of the industry’s most pressing challenges. The protocol’s innovative Proof-of-Renewable-Stake (PoRS) consensus mechanism requires validators to provide proof of renewable energy usage, reducing the network’s carbon footprint by up to 99% compared to traditional mining. GreenBlock incorporates a unique carbon credit system where transaction fees contribute to verified environmental projects. The platform has already partnered with several renewable energy providers and environmental organizations, creating a sustainable ecosystem for cryptocurrency operations. The token’s utility extends beyond environmental benefits, as it’s used for governance, staking, and accessing premium features within the GreenBlock ecosystem. The team includes environmental scientists and blockchain developers, ensuring both technical excellence and ecological responsibility. Recent developments include the launch of their renewable energy verification system and partnerships with major carbon offset providers. 3. DeFiMatrix (DMAT): Advanced Cross-Chain DeFi Protocol with AI Risk Management DeFiMatrix introduces groundbreaking innovations in the DeFi space through its sophisticated cross-chain lending and borrowing platform. The protocol’s standout feature is its AI-powered risk assessment algorithm, which dynamically adjusts collateral requirements based on real-time market conditions and historical volatility patterns. This smart collateral system has achieved a remarkable 40% reduction in liquidation events compared to traditional platforms. The protocol supports multiple chains, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Solana, with plans to expand to emerging Layer-1 networks. DeFiMatrix’s unique yield optimization strategy automatically redistributes funds across different protocols to maximize returns while minimizing risk. The platform has already secured over $500 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) and continues to grow. Their innovative approach to risk management has attracted attention from institutional investors, and they’re working on implementing institutional-grade security features. 4. Binance Coin (BNB): The Powerhouse Behind the World’s Largest Crypto Exchange Binance Coin (BNB) has transformed from a simple utility token into one of cryptocurrency’s most formidable assets, consistently demonstrating remarkable stability and versatility in the volatile crypto market. Initially conceived to reduce trading fees on the Binance exchange, BNB has evolved into a cornerstone of the broader crypto ecosystem, powering transactions across decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, NFT marketplaces, and the innovative Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The token’s economic model includes a strategic quarterly burning mechanism, where Binance systematically reduces the total supply by permanently removing tokens from circulation. This deflationary approach has proven highly effective, helping propel BNB into the cryptocurrency market’s top echelon. The token’s value proposition extends far beyond trading fee discounts, as it now serves as the foundational currency for countless decentralized applications and financial protocols built on BSC. With Binance’s continuous ecosystem expansion, improving regulatory landscape, and the growing adoption of blockchain technology, BNB stands poised for significant appreciation by 2025. Its robust infrastructure, widespread utility, and strong institutional backing make it an attractive option for both retail and institutional investors looking for established cryptocurrencies with substantial growth potential. 5. Dogecoin (DOGE): From Meme to Mainstream: The People’s Cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) has transcended its origins as a lighthearted meme coin to become a significant player in the cryptocurrency landscape, driven by its passionate community and high-profile endorsements, particularly from tech visionary Elon Musk. The cryptocurrency’s fundamental strength lies in its accessibility and practical utility, featuring notably low transaction fees and swift processing times that make it particularly well-suited for everyday transactions, digital tipping, and charitable giving. Despite its humorous beginnings, Dogecoin’s technical infrastructure is built on solid foundations, with a secure network and faster block time than Bitcoin, enabling efficient and reliable transactions. The cryptocurrency’s remarkable journey has been fueled by its cultural resonance and the unwavering support of its vast, engaged community, factors that have helped stabilize its value relative to many alternative cryptocurrencies. While currently trading at accessible price points, Dogecoin has demonstrated its capacity for explosive growth during bull markets. Looking toward 2025, the combination of increasing mainstream adoption, potential institutional investment, and its established role in popular culture positions Dogecoin for potential significant gains, though investors should carefully consider its inherent volatility and speculative nature. 6. BlockDAG (BDAG): Revolutionary DAG Technology Reshaping Blockchain Scalability BlockDAG represents a groundbreaking evolution in blockchain technology, fundamentally reimagining how distributed ledgers can operate at scale. At its core, the project leverages Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture to enable parallel block processing, a significant departure from traditional blockchain’s linear approach. This innovative design allows BlockDAG to achieve remarkable transaction throughput, processing thousands of transactions per second while maintaining robust security and decentralization principles. The project’s technical architecture addresses the blockchain trilemma in an elegant way: instead of forcing trade-offs between scalability, security, and decentralization, BlockDAG’s parallel processing capability enables all three to coexist harmoniously. This makes it particularly attractive for high-performance applications in DeFi, gaming, and enterprise solutions. The network’s modified Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism demonstrates remarkable energy efficiency, consuming significantly less power than traditional PoW networks while maintaining comparable security guarantees. BlockDAG’s governance structure empowers token holders through a sophisticated voting mechanism, ensuring community-driven development while preserving network stability. With growing developer interest and increasing institutional attention, BlockDAG is positioning itself as a serious contender in the Layer 1 blockchain space, potentially revolutionizing how we think about scalable blockchain solutions. 7. Kaspa (KAS): Pioneering BlockDAG Technology for Next-Generation Scalability Kaspa represents the cutting edge of blockchain evolution, implementing a sophisticated BlockDAG architecture that fundamentally transforms how distributed networks can scale. The project’s innovative approach allows for parallel block processing, enabling the network to handle multiple transaction streams simultaneously while maintaining the security guarantees that make blockchain technology valuable. This parallel processing capability translates into impressive performance metrics, with transaction confirmation times measured in seconds rather than minutes. What sets Kaspa apart is its unique implementation of the GHOSTDAG protocol, an advancement over traditional Proof-of-Work systems that enables secure and efficient block ordering in a parallel processing environment. This technical innovation allows Kaspa to achieve remarkable throughput without compromising on decentralization, addressing one of the fundamental challenges facing blockchain technology. The project’s development team, composed of experienced blockchain researchers and engineers, continues to push the boundaries of what’s possible in distributed systems. With its focus on scalability, security, and developer accessibility, Kaspa is attracting increasing attention from both the technical community and investors. The project’s potential to reshape blockchain infrastructure makes it a compelling investment consideration for those looking at long-term growth in the cryptocurrency space.

38174361,https://crypto.news/?p=14322522,1735286771,Binance to support Optimism network upgrade and hard fork,"Binance support for Optimism network upgrade aims to improve performance and user experience. On Jan. 10, 2025, at 2:00 (UTC+8), Binance announced its support for the Optimism ( OP ) network upgrade and hard fork. To facilitate the upgrade, Binance will temporarily halt token deposits and withdrawals on the OP network starting from 1:00 (UTC+8) on the same day. The OP network upgrade is designed to enhance the network’s user experience, scalability, and overall performance. Binance has assured users that the trading of tokens supported by the OP network will remain unaffected during this period. A major update or modification to a blockchain network’s protocol that is incompatible with earlier versions is known as a hard fork . This implies that all network participants must update their software to the most recent version to continue engaging in network activities. Hard forks often resolve security vulnerabilities, introduce new features, or boost the network’s scalability and efficiency. Hard forks have historically played a pivotal role in the development of blockchain technology. For instance, the “Merge” transitioned Ethereum to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, while the “London” update introduced EIP-1559, which replaced the traditional auction-based fee model with a base fee that is burned (removed from circulation) and an optional priority fee (tip) for faster transactions. This improved gas fee predictability and added a deflationary element to Ethereum’s ( ETH ) supply. These enhancements highlight the importance of continuous innovation and security in blockchain networks.

To avoid any inconvenience, users are advised to complete necessary transactions in advance. Binance will handle all technical requirements for the upgrade, ensuring a seamless experience for users. Deposits and withdrawals will resume automatically once the network has stabilized, with no further announcements needed. Users are also encouraged by Binance to keep up with the upgrade and make sure to read the official upgrade announcement by the OP network as well. for the most up-to-date information.

Morehead, who has been investing in Bitcoin since 2013 when it was just $65, expressed his belief in the four-year Bitcoin cycle in a recent interview. Morehead argues that the Bitcoin halving, a pre-programmed event that slows down the rate at which new Bitcoins are created, is the primary driver of these cycles. He compares the halving to the closure of half of the world’s copper mines, an event that would undoubtedly cause copper prices to rise. He notes that miners typically sell off their Bitcoin holdings to cover operating costs, and the halving effectively squeezes supply while demand remains constant, sending prices soaring. Related News: Company CEO Talks About Bitcoin: “People Want to Hold More Bitcoin, Not Less” While Morehead acknowledges that the impact of each halving diminishes over time, it remains important in the current market. He cited Pantera Capital’s accurate predictions for previous halving cycles, including an accurate prediction for Bitcoin’s price on August 15, 2020. Based on its data, Pantera predicts that the low point of the current cycle occurred approximately 400 days before the most recent halving (April 19, 2024), with the peak occurring approximately 480 days later, around August 2025. Morehead also touched on the interaction between macroeconomic factors and Bitcoin. He expressed skepticism about the Fed’s ability to lower interest rates, citing a growing economy, low unemployment, and high wage inflation. He believes current interest rates are appropriate given the economic climate. He also voiced concerns about the US’s $2 trillion budget deficit, even in times of economic prosperity, hinting at potential future economic challenges. While he did not explicitly link this to a positive Bitcoin outlook, he did imply that these macroeconomic conditions create a favorable environment for cryptocurrencies. *This is not investment advice.

38174311,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=314269,1735286675,‘One of the Most Powerful Patterns in All of Crypto’: Raoul Pal Says Ethereum Signaling Very Big Move Ahead,"Macro guru and Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal believes Ethereum ( ETH ) is gearing up for an explosive move. In a new YouTube strategy session, Pal says that the leading smart contract platform by volume is forming a bullish wedge pattern on its weekly chart, setting the top altcoin up for a breakout. “The weekly chart of Ethereum hasn’t yet broken out, but it’s very close. So whether we break out this month, which is my hunch, and then maybe retest in the January pullback from liquidity, or we pull back here for a bit and then explode through afterward, either way, that chart, that wedge pattern, to me, is one of the most powerful patterns in all of crypto and suggests we’ve got a very big move in Ethereum to come.” Source: Raoul Pal/YouTube Pal also believes that Ethereum paired against Bitcoin (ETH/ BTC ) could shoot up based on the ISM Manufacturing Index, which is viewed as an indicator of the health of the US economy. “The business cycle is the coincident factor for the Ethereum/Bitcoin cross. So that says as the ISM starts rising ETH starts outperforming Bitcoin. And why is that? Well, it’s a function of ISM being confidence in the economy, disposable income or free cash flows from businesses. People have more money and feel better and have more confidence as the ISM goes up. The business cycle’s better. We’re earning a bit more. Our businesses are doing better, we’re making a bit more profit. And we recycle those profits into investments, and we go further out in the risk curve, which would be Ethereum.” Source: Raoul Pal/YouTube The former Goldman Sachs executive goes on to note that ETH/BTC is also forming a bullish wedge on its weekly chart. “It’s another wedge. This is the ETH/Bitcoin weekly cross. Look at the big picture. ETH basically is at the same level versus Bitcoin that it was in 2017. It has held value over time, which is very important. It shows that this thing is around and it’s here to stay. So what we’re doing is bouncing off the bottom channel now, just as the ISM is about to pick up, and we either break that wedge, which is a big deal, because that would be ETH outperforming Bitcoin even further, or we stay in that larger range but get to the top of the range. My base case is we breakout and ETH outperforms.” Source: Raoul Pal/YouTube ETH/BTC is trading for 0.03501 BTC ($3,354) at time of writing.

38175320,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53227,1735286544,"XRP Whale Activity Resumes, 30.17 Million XRP Moved to Coinbase","The cryptocurrency market has witnessed a notable development as 30,171,667 XRP tokens, valued at approximately $69.24 million, were transferred from an unidentified wallet to Coinbase. This large-scale movement was flagged by Whale Alert, a reputable platform known for tracking significant cryptocurrency transactions. The event stands out, given the relative inactivity among XRP whales in recent days. Whale Alert’s timeline shows that this is the first whale transaction involving XRP since a similar alert of 60 million XRP ($132 million) surfaced two days ago. Context of Whale Activity Whales, or individuals/entities holding significant amounts of a cryptocurrency, often wield considerable influence over market dynamics. Their actions can indicate broader trends or strategic decisions within the market. The recent inactivity among XRP whales had been notable, making this transfer particularly significant. The decision to move such a large amount of XRP to Coinbase may carry multiple interpretations. It could reflect strategic selling, portfolio rebalancing, or even institutional involvement. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Significance of the Transaction Large transactions such as this often draw attention due to their potential implications for market sentiment and price movements. When XRP is moved to exchanges like Coinbase, it may signal a pending sale. Such activity sometimes leads to increased market volatility, depending on the volume and timing of subsequent trades. This transfer comes at a critical juncture for XRP. The asset seems to be consolidating for the new year after recently hitting a multi-year high of $2.86. XRP garnered significant attention due to this whopping transfer. There are also reports that whales are preparing for something big in January . The resumption of whale activity on the network suggests the whales are gearing up for something. Potential Impact on XRP’s Market Performance XRP’s price and trading volume often react to whale movements, though the extent of the impact varies. As of now, there has been no immediate or dramatic shift in XRP’s market performance following this transaction. The digital asset is trading at $2.28, showing a modest 1.38% decrease from yesterday. However, whales re-entering the market could cause excitement similar to the recent launch of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin . This excitement could give XRP one last boost in 2024, potentially helping it cross the $3 mark before the new year.

42415956,b5eafcb7-634d-429c-ba61-888bff734c6c,1735286216,Memecoin Degens Raise Millions for Rare Cancer Research After a Father’s Plea,"A Pump.Fun memecoin zoomed from zero to an $80 million market capitalization on Thursday after a father’s plea for donations to a research study for his daughter’s rare brain cancer attracted swathes of crypto traders.  The MIRA token’s price has fallen 80% from a Thursday peak and trades at just over a cent as of Friday. But while late buyers are sitting on losses, the effort raised over $1 million for the cause.  In an X post on Thursday, Siqi Chen, founder of the Runway corporate finance planning application, said his daughter Mira was diagnosed with a type of brain tumor in September and that research and funding had “been lacking” because of the rarity of the condition.  His GoFundMe page has raised 80% of its $300,000 target as of Thursday, with all proceeds going directly to research efforts at the Hankinson Lab at the Univerity of Colorado.  Chen also posted his Ethereum wallet on the X thread, responding to user demand, adding his Solana and Bitcoin addresses when users asked for more options.  Then Pump.fun happened.  The Pump.fun platform lets anyone issue a token for less than $2 in capital, after which they choose the number of tokens, theme, and meme picture to accompany it. When the market capitalization of any token reaches $69,000, a portion of liquidity is deposited to the Solana-based exchange Raydium and burned.      A Pump.fun user created the MIRA token attached to a picture of Chen and his daughter, with no apparent objective except it being a token that can be traded like any other memecoin. The user’s profile shows MIRA was just one of the several tokens they created that day, with none of the others breaking a $6,000 market cap.  From there, though, things started to take off. X user @Waddles_eth bought  50% of the supply and sent all of it to Chen. Chen then boosted the memecoin on his X account.  That ensured virality for the token, sending the price from fractions of a penny to a peak of 8 cents early Thursday. The value of Chen’s token holdings soared from $400,000 to over $18 million. MIRA attracted a peak of $7 million in liquidity (in terms of both Solana’s SOL and the memecoin) as it became widely traded.  Trading volume topped $85 million in more than 130,000 transactions, making it the most popular smallcap in the past 24 hours.  “I have been on the internet for 30 years and have seen some shit, but this is by far the craziest day of my life,” Chen wrote on X as prices rocketed. “I will be liquidating $1,000 worth of $MIRA every 10 minutes, perpetually. If change this schedule, i commit to announcing it 24 hours in advance.”  “If you want to rug it to $0, go for it - at the end of the day we set out to raise $200K and we will end up with at least $1M towards rare disease research,” he wrote.  Community response to the event has been overwhelmingly positive, with several users pointing out how such memecoins can contribute to positive outcomes in the world.  Memecoins are largely based on virality, attention and hype. They are considered non-serious among professional investors, but have seen massive demand and preference in the past year compared with larger venture capital-backed crypto tokens — which are perceived as enriching already-rich investors at the expense of smaller retail traders.  MIRA has helped shift the conversation.  “I think memecoins are dumb and have no future and I don't touch them. But if I wanted to make a case for them I would now know where to start,” X user @JaEsf said. “This is beautiful and quite crazy that you can do that with crypto. EVM, Solana or any chain. This is why Crypto exist! Simplify movement of assets,” said @mbaril010, another X user.  Meanwhile, @waddles_eth, the user who originally sent half the token’s supply to Chen, said the overall outcome met their expectations.  “When I saw the story about Mira and her illness, I thought it would be good to buy and send supply to you with the hopes of getting the SOL community behind a good cause on Christmas,” they said in a now-viral X post. “I'm really glad that it worked out the way that it has and I hope that the money helps to find a cure both for Mira and anyone else with her condition.”  Crypto for good may finally become a thing in the new year.

The attackers impersonated Animoca and falsely announced the launch of a token. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT attributed the hack to a phishing scam that has recently targeted over 15 crypto-focused X accounts, ultimately stealing almost $500,000. Fraudulent ‘MOCA’ Token Siu’s hacked account shared a link to a fake token called Animoca Brands (MOCA) on the Pump.fun platform, which bore the same name as both the company and its Mocaverse NFT collection. This fraudulent MOCA token was then traced back to the same address behind other fraudulent tokens, ZachXBT confirmed . After being promoted on Siu’s account, the token briefly reached a peak value of almost $37,000, only to crash moments later to a market cap of just $5,735, as per data compiled by Birdeye. Currently, there are only 33 holders of the token. ZachXBT had previously uncovered this sophisticated phishing scheme wherein phishing emails disguised as urgent messages from the X team often cited fabricated copyright issues and tricked victims into resetting their account credentials. The scheme leveraged the credibility of crypto-related accounts with large audiences. A majority of those had more than 200,000 followers. Affected accounts included Kick, Cursor, The Arena, Brett, and Alex Blania. The first attack was on November 26, involving RuneMine, and the most recent occurred on December 24, affecting Kick, just before Siu’s. 2FA “Not Enough” to Secure Accounts Siu explained that the hacker somehow obtained his password and used the account recovery page to bypass 2FA by submitting a request with a non-registered email address. He tested this process and noted a significant security gap: while the system triggered a login notification to the wrong email, the actual, registered email received no alerts regarding critical actions like a 2FA change request. He said that this lack of notification could have prevented the hack. Siu also added that the hacker submitted a government-issued ID to bypass further security checks, a tactic he suspects was facilitated by phishing. He urged X to implement stronger notifications, particularly for sensitive changes like 2FA modifications, and recommended better verification measures to protect accounts. Siu also warned that 2FA alone is not enough to secure an account and advised maintaining strong password hygiene, as attackers can bypass 2FA once they have access to the password.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. The crypto market in 2025 could see a surge in meme-based coins, blending humor with innovation to captivate communities and investors alike. Table of Contents Catzilla: A giant leap for meme coins CHILLGUY: New digital asset SHIRO Coin: Emerging crypto with promising potential Catwifhat: Deflationary coin with perpetual auto-burn on Solana Notcoin: A community token bridging gaming and web3 technology Conclusion The crypto scene could witness remarkable shifts in 2025, with certain meme-based coins hinting at tremendous growth. These unique digital currencies, driven by internet culture and community enthusiasm, might be on the cusp of significant leaps. Uncover five of these intriguing tokens that could potentially make a notable impact on the market and draw substantial attention. Catzilla: A giant leap for meme coins In the dynamic landscape of meme coins, few contenders roar as loudly as Catzilla. Inspired by the success stories of Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and PEPE, Catzilla combines the humor and chaos of meme culture with kaiju-inspired storytelling. Picture a colossal, Godzilla-like cat wreaking havoc while rallying a community of gamers, anime fans, and crypto enthusiasts.

Designed to enhance transaction efficiency and security, it seeks to address common challenges in the crypto space. CHILLGUY’s technology focuses on improving scalability and user experience, which could set it apart from existing digital currencies. In the current market cycle, with continued interest in emerging cryptocurrencies, CHILLGUY presents potential opportunities for investors. Its attractiveness depends on its technological developments and the adoption rate within the crypto community. SHIRO Coin: Emerging crypto with promising potential SHIRO is a cryptocurrency designed to offer innovative solutions in the blockchain industry. It aims to enhance transaction speed and security while reducing costs. SHIRO utilizes advanced technology to improve scalability and user experience. In the current market cycle, SHIRO appears attractive to investors looking for new opportunities. Its potential lies in addressing challenges faced by existing cryptocurrencies. With unique features and growing adoption, SHIRO could play a significant role in the future of digital currencies. Catwifhat: Deflationary coin with perpetual auto-burn on Solana Catwifhat is a meme coin on the Solana blockchain featuring a unique auto-burn mechanism. Introduced in December 2023, it applies a 4% burn fee to every on-chain transaction, including DEX buys, sells, and wallet transfers. This deflationary measure reduces the supply of CWIF over time. Since all contract authorities were revoked day 1, the auto-burn cannot be altered and will continue indefinitely. The perpetual reduction in supply may influence the coin’s value dynamics. In the current market cycle, CWIF presents a distinct model within the memecoin space. Notcoin: A community token bridging gaming and web3 technology Notcoin began as a viral Telegram game that introduced many users to web3 through a tap-to-earn mining mechanic. NOT is a community token where users earn by exploring web3 products, playing games, and contributing to the ecosystem. Web3 builders can offer their products to the community via Notcoin campaigns. The coin leverages gaming to make web3 accessible and engaging. In the current market cycle, Notcoin’s blend of gaming and web3 technology may attract users seeking interactive and rewarding experiences in the crypto space. Conclusion CHILLGUY, SHIRO, CWIF, and NOT show less short-term potential. In contrast, Catzilla emerges as a leading meme coin, aiming to bring financial freedom to everyone with a 700% ROI potential during its presale, starting at $0.0002 and rising over 14 stages. It offers governance features, loyalty rewards, and passive staking options, uniting enthusiasts in the fight against crypto villains.

38173039,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398737,1735284083,How Will Donald Trump’s Pro-Crypto Plans Impact Bitcoin Price?,"The post How Will Donald Trump’s Pro-Crypto Plans Impact Bitcoin Price? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The idea that Donald Trump’s presidency could reshape Bitcoin’s future is gaining attention, with analysts sharing differing views on how his policies might boost cryptocurrency growth. As the conversation grows, one thing is clear: Trump’s approach could have a major impact on digital assets. One analyst suggests that Trump’s administration could significantly raise Bitcoin’s value by pushing for the tokenization of traditional assets, like Apple and Amazon stocks. This would create a world where assets are traded digitally, making Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies more integral to the financial system. The analyst believes this shift could unlock trillions of dollars in digital assets, presenting a huge opportunity for Bitcoin in 2025 . A Pro-Bitcoin Shift in Washington Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, has also revealed that Trump plans to clean out the SEC and replace key figures with people who are more supportive of Bitcoin. This could elevate Bitcoin’s role, with some experts speculating that the cryptocurrency could become part of the U.S. strategic reserve. Many believe Trump will measure his success by Bitcoin’s price , even predicting that under his leadership, Bitcoin could reach $500,000. Clearer Regulations for a Mainstream Bitcoin Kristen Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, agrees with the idea that Trump’s presidency could bring much-needed regulatory clarity to Bitcoin. She points out that the lack of clear regulations for Bitcoin exchanges has held back the growth of the cryptocurrency. With Trump’s pro-Bitcoin stance , she believes clearer rules will encourage more big companies to invest in Bitcoin, making it a mainstream asset. Smith also notes that the regulatory issues faced by companies like Coinbase and Robinhood could have been avoided with more transparent policies, ultimately saving investors money. Overall, analysts believe that Trump’s presidency could be a turning point for Bitcoin. With clearer regulations, more institutional adoption, and a friendlier attitude toward cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin could reach new heights and become a truly global asset. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025: Tom Lee Predicts $200,000 Surge Before Major Drop , Challenges to U.S. Bitcoin Mining Plans However, not everyone is convinced. Ethan Vera, COO of Luxor Technology, recently dismissed Trump’s plans to bring all Bitcoin mining to the U.S. during an interview with Bloomberg. He explained that Bitcoin mining is a costly and energy-intensive process, and most miners are located in areas where energy is cheaper. Vera argues that Trump would struggle to shift mining operations to the U.S. through restrictive crypto policies because of the global nature of Bitcoin mining. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-cyborg-trumpcyb-solana-memecoin-to-explode-15000-before-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

38172936,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398698,1735283882,"“Pig Butchering” Scams Target Ethereum Investors, $3.6 Billion Stolen in 2024","The post “Pig Butchering” Scams Target Ethereum Investors, $3.6 Billion Stolen in 2024 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In 2024, Pig Butchering scams became one of the most alarming threats to crypto investors, with a staggering $3.6 billion in assets stolen. What makes these scams so dangerous? They’re deeply manipulative, targeting investors with carefully crafted relationships and promises of big returns. A recent report from Cyvers , a Web3 security company, revealed that Ethereum blockchain users were hit the hardest, with over 150,000 wallet addresses affected across nearly 800,000 transactions. Keep reading to uncover the shocking details. What are Pig Butchering Scams? Pig Butchering is a type of scam where criminals build fake but convincing relationships with their targets. They then trick victims into making large investments in fraudulent cryptocurrency platforms. Once the money is invested, the scammers vanish, leaving investors with nothing. These scams have become more advanced, leading to a 40% increase in cyber threats in the crypto industry this year. This rise in targeted attacks shows the need for increased awareness and stronger security measures. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Hack Weekly Report: $2.2 Billion Stolen in 2024, Centralized Exchanges Hit Hard , Access Control Breaches: A Key Factor Access control breaches were another significant factor behind crypto fraud this year. According to the report, these breaches made up 81% of all crypto fraud cases. These incidents not only caused significant financial losses but also highlight the importance of improving protection against unauthorized access and transfers. A separate report from Chainanalysis showed that digital currency theft rose to $2.2 billion in 2024, up from $1.8 billion in 2023. North Korean hackers were behind $1.34 billion of the thefts—more than double their total from 2023. Exchanges Under Attack 2024 also saw a shift in focus from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to centralized exchanges. High-profile attacks included Japan’s DMM Bitcoin, which lost $305 million, and India’s WazirX , which was compromised for $234.9 million. Hackers used mixers and blockchain bridges to launder 90% of the stolen funds, while weak private key management allowed them to steal 43.8% of the money. The rise in crypto scams and cyberattacks serves as both a warning and a reminder to stay alert. As cryptocurrencies grow in popularity, it’s crucial for investors to thoroughly check investment offers and stick to trusted service providers to keep their assets safe. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

38172949,https://crypto.news/?p=14322517,1735283876,Bitwise files for ETF tracking companies holding over 1000 Bitcoin in treasury,"Bitwise has proposed a new exchange-traded fund that invests in publicly traded companies holding over 1000 BTC in their corporate treasuries. In a Dec. 26 regulatory filing , Bitwise said the Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF will invest in equity securities of publicly traded firms that have adopted the “Bitcoin standard” by holding at least 1,000 Bitcoin (BTC) in their corporate treasuries. These securities include “common stock, depositary receipts (both American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) and Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”), tracking stocks and other equity units. Such securities may be issued by U.S. and non-U.S. companies including companies operating in emerging market countries,” the filing noted. To qualify for inclusion, companies must have at least $100 million in market capitalization, average daily liquidity of at least $1 million, and a public free float of under 10%. These criteria will be assessed based on quarterly and annual corporate reports. In terms of weighting, the ETF will prioritize the market value of each company’s Bitcoin holdings rather than its overall market capitalization, which is typically the case with traditional equity ETFs. You might also like: What Bitwise knows about Bitcoin’s $200,000 prediction and why it matters to you? For instance, Marathon Digital Holdings, with over 44,000 BTC in its reserves, will have a higher weighting in the ETF than Tesla, which holds 9,720 BTC, despite its significantly larger $1.42 trillion market capitalization compared to Marathon’s $6.55 billion. However, no stock will exceed a weighting of 25% in the fund to ensure diversification and prevent overexposure to any single company. Commenting on the filing, Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, said that the ETF could see many companies vying for a spot in the index. Fuelled by Bitcoin’s performance this year, a wave of Wall Street-focused investment products has emerged, catering to the growing appetite among institutional investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through regulated and familiar financial vehicles. Bitwise, for instance, proposed a Bitcoin-Ethereum mixed crypto ETF to U.S. regulators. According to the Nov. 26 S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the ETF aims to provide balanced exposure between Bitcoin and Ethereum, offering investors a diversified approach to the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. On Dec. 21, New York-based GraniteShares filed for a set of leveraged ETFs aimed at tracking prominent companies with significant crypto exposure, including Riot Platforms, Marathon Digital, MicroStrategy, and Robinhood. Meanwhile, earlier this month, Grayscale Investments filed to convert its Solana Trust (GSOL) into an exchange-traded fund.

The report indicates that there was a 40% annual rise in the number of cyber attacks in 2024 compared to 2023, with 165 incidents costing $2.3 billion in damages. The sum was still down 37% from the fraud peak in 2022, but complex schemes and breaches surged this year. Access control breaches made up most of that damage, with 67 incidents totaling $1.9 billion. Other attack vectors included smart contract vulnerabilities, leading to losses of $456.8 million over 98 incidents, and address poisoning assaults, resulting in $68.7 million in a single major case. These attack methods demonstrate the loopholes in blockchain networks and decentralized applications that scammers still take advantage of.

Cyvers cited the blockchain’s ease of access as a key factor in the fraudulent schemes, which they said allowed scammers to send over 100,000 small inducement payments to victims as part of their grooming methods. https://twitter.com/CyversAlerts/status/1872496881139683423 Educating the users about these incidents is imperative in combating access control breaches, believes Deddy Lavid, CEO of Cyvers. Greater transparency in exchange operations and enhanced user vigilance are also essential to reduce the success rate of these types of frauds, he noted.

With trust secured, the way is open for deploying smaller amounts of cash to siphon off larger pots in the hundreds of millions, often in Tether ( USDT ) through less transparent exchanges such as Binance, HTX, OKX, Crypto. com, and Coinbase. Illicit cash is usually laundered through decentralized and centralized exchanges before it is cashed out. Crypto scams on the rise The most important attacks in 2024 includes WazirX , which lost $235 million on a vulnerability in its multi-sig wallet system in one of the largest hacks of the year. https://twitter.com/CyversAlerts/status/1813834131165286464 DMM Exchange was hacked and lost $305 million when attackers compromised a private key in the platform’s Bitcoin ( BTC ) hot wallet. It was another high-profile breach. Additionally, hackers compromised the devices used to access the platform, resulting in a $50 million loss for Radiant Capital, In contrast, BingX was drained of $52 million worth of funds when attackers were able to access the exchange’s hot wallets and transfer funds across multiple networks. Like this, these incidents unveil the recurring vulnerabilities of many crypto exchanges. Recovery However, even in the face of these losses, some progress was made in the rehabilitation effort. In 2024, approximately $1.3 billion was returned to victims, primarily on-chain detectives like ZachXBT and bug bounty programs. The first quarter of 2024 had the highest number of incidences of any quarter in the year, at 53, the study noted. The largest amount, roughly $760 million, was lost in Q3 2024, while Q4 exhibited the lowest activity and losses.

Bitcoin (BTC), a major player in the crypto world, has seen its price fall to $96,200 . But amid this recent downturn, some experts are predicting big things ahead. Could Bitcoin be on the verge of a major comeback? As 2025 nears, one prominent analyst is forecasting a future that might just surprise you. Keep reading to discover why Bitcoin’s best days could still be ahead. Tom Lee’s Optimistic Bitcoin Prediction In a recent interview with CNBC , Tom Lee shared an optimistic outlook for Bitcoin. He predicts that Bitcoin could surge to $200,000 in 2025, driven by several key factors. Lee sees the changing U.S. political landscape as a significant driver for Bitcoin’s growth. He points out that the U.S. government’s potential involvement in accumulating Bitcoin would be a game changer, showing that Bitcoin is becoming a legitimate alternative to traditional assets like gold. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : When Will Bitcoin Price Hit $117,000? Timeline Revealed! , Lee also noted that more people are considering adding Bitcoin to their retirement portfolios, which could lead to a rise in demand and push its price higher. A Bright Future for Altcoins Bitcoin isn’t the only cryptocurrency Lee expects to see significant growth. He also predicts a surge for altcoins. Lee believes Ethereum could rise to between $5,000 and $6,000, while other altcoins like Solana may also experience strong gains in the upcoming rally. Lee also mentioned that under President Donald Trump, Bitcoin could be recognized as a Strategic Reserve asset. He believes this shift would create the perfect conditions for Bitcoin to reach new heights. Confident in Bitcoin’s Long-Term Growth While Lee acknowledges the risks involved in any market, he remains confident that Bitcoin’s price will keep rising. He argues that the $50,000 price range is likely behind us, as Bitcoin continues to gain more support from institutions and governments. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

With every new prediction, the future of Bitcoin looks brighter—perhaps far beyond what many once thought possible. FAQs How much is Bitcoin today?

In 2030, the price of 1 Bitcoin could reach a height of $610,646. Why is Bitcoin down today?

Timeline Revealed! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin surged to $99.8K yesterday, only to drop to $95,484, losing the gains from the Christmas rally. Despite this decline, traders remain optimistic, with many speculating that Bitcoin could hit $110K to $117K. However, Santiment notes that Bitcoin tends to reach $110K when it’s least expected. While Bitcoin has fallen recently, the market continues to be optimistic about its long-term potential. Bitcoin has jumped to as high as $99.8K on a bullish Christmas crypto performance. Traders are now swinging bullish once again, with speculation of $110K getting rampant. Historically, we will see $110K Bitcoin only after the crowd doesn't expect it, as this image shows. pic.twitter.com/j4w3VQ4Zio — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 26, 2024 But are these targets being overhyped? What’s the realistic price Bitcoin could reach in the upcoming bull market? Let’s take a look at insights from top analysts. Dan’s Bitcoin Prediction 2025 Dan Morehead, CEO of Pantera Capital, predicts Bitcoin could hit $117,000 by August 2025. His forecast is based on Bitcoin’s historical price patterns around halving events, which happen every four years. The halving reduces miners’ rewards, and Morehead points out that Bitcoin’s price usually begins to rise about 400 days before the halving and peaks around 480 days after the event. The last halving occurred in April 2024, cutting the miner reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Morehead believes Bitcoin will follow this trend and reach $117,000, which would be a 22.53% increase from its current price of $95,484. Macro Factors Can’t Be Ruled Out… In addition to the halving, Morehead considers broader macroeconomic conditions and political factors that could push Bitcoin’s price higher. He believes these external forces will contribute to Bitcoin reaching $117,000 by mid-2025. His prediction comes during a period of strong growth for Bitcoin, with many investors watching the halving closely for signs of continued bullish momentum. If Bitcoin follows its usual pattern, the next few months could bring significant price gains. Could Bitcoin Soar to $500K? Trump’s Proposal Fuels Speculation Pantera’s bullish outlook is shared by others in the market. Matt Hougan, CIO of Bitwise, recently suggested that Bitcoin could skyrocket to $500,000 if Donald Trump’s plan to create a national Bitcoin stockpile takes off. This idea, first introduced at the Bitcoin Conference earlier this year, has sparked widespread interest. Some believe other countries might follow the U.S. lead, especially since Japan has rejected the Bitcoin Reserve plan. This could give the U.S. the chance to establish itself as a global leader in Bitcoin. Perianne Boring, CEO of the Digital Chamber, has also joined the ranks of Bitcoin bulls, predicting that Bitcoin could reach $800,000 under Trump’s leadership. Dips as Opportunities: Caution Advised! With Bitcoin on the rise, analysts see short-term dips as great buying opportunities, much like MicroStrategy is doing right now. However, experts warn that if Trump’s policies face delays due to political disagreements, a market crash could follow. Bitcoin’s future is uncertain, but predictions remain bold. While the market is optimistic, only time will tell how high Bitcoin can climb—and how soon it will get there.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/heres-when-bitcoin-price-will-hit-117000/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
38172426,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398653,1735282845,Top 10 AI-Based Altcoins To Invest in 2025: Expert Analysis,"The post Top 10 AI-Based Altcoins To Invest in 2025: Expert Analysis appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency industry is constantly evolving, but one sector seems to be leaving the rest behind —Artificial Intelligence (AI). With AI technology gaining rapid adoption, it’s no wonder investors are now turning their attention to AI-based altcoins for potential gains in 2025. While meme coins continue to make noise, it’s the AI-driven tokens that are quietly gaining momentum, hinting at a bullish trend ahead. So, which of these AI altcoins could soar to new heights this year? Let’s dive into the top 10 picks with the most potential to skyrocket, backed by strong technical indicators and promising price action. Bitttensor (TAO) Bitttensor (TAO) has not yet gained major momentum, similar to major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. However, TAO is currently trading within a range of $432 to $702, with the token recently hitting the lower end of this range, suggesting a potential price rise soon. Source: Trading View TAO is also forming a bullish double-bottom price pattern on its weekly chart, which is a positive sign. If it stays above $430, there is a good chance it could surge by 52% to $720 in the future, making it one of the top AI-based altcoins to watch. Near Protocol (NEAR) Following the presidential election results in the United States, Near Protocol (NEAR) surged by over 125%, rising from $3.60 to $8.05. However, due to market uncertainty and profit-taking, the price has corrected by 37%, reaching the crucial Golden Fibonacci zone while also finding support at the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, NEAR’s current daily chart indicates a strong buying opportunity with a 1:8 risk-to-reward ratio. If NEAR maintains support above the $4.80 mark, there is a strong possibility it could rally by 57% to reach $8.11 in the coming days. The Graph (GRT) Similar to NEAR, The Graph (GRT) has also experienced a notable price decline and has now reached the Golden Fibonacci zone, making it an ideal investment for 2025. However, due to market uncertainty, GRT appears to be consolidating within a tight range. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, there is a strong possibility that the token could soar by 66% in the coming days. This bullish thesis will hold only if GRT remains above the $0.20 mark; otherwise, this bullish outlook may fail. Render Network (RENDER) Render Network (RENDER) currently appears to be consolidating within a tight range near strong support provided by the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the crucial horizontal level of $6.80. Source: Trading View Additionally, RENDER’s price action pattern shows similarities to TAO and GRT. Based on recent price action, if RENDER maintains support above the $6.70 level, there is a strong possibility it could rally by 60% to reach $11.60 in the future. Internet Computer (ICP) Amid market uncertainty, ICP, the native token of Internet Computer, experienced a price decline of over 35% and found support at the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the horizontal level of $9.50. However, the ICP price now appears to be recovering. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, there is a strong possibility that ICP could rally by 45% to reach the $15.30 level in the coming days. This bullish thesis will hold only if ICP remains above the $9.50 mark; otherwise, it may fail. Artificial Super Intelligence (FET) During the ongoing price correction phase, the top AI-based altcoin, Artificial Super Intelligence (FET), appears to have recovered after experiencing a price decline of over 45% in recent weeks. Following this notable drop, FET has reached a crucial support level at the $1.14 mark, which has historically served as a strong support zone and an area of significant buying pressure. Source: Trading View Since September 2024, FET has tested this level four times, and each time it has rebounded with buying pressure and upward momentum. Experts and analysts anticipate a similar rally. Based on recent price action, there is a strong possibility that FET could soar by 69% to reach the $2.05 mark in the future. This bullish price action cements FET’s position as a top AI-based altcoin. Theta Network (THETA) THETA, the native token of Theta Network, is poised for significant upside momentum as it has formed a bullish price action pattern on its daily time frame. The altcoin saw substantial gains in November 2024 but has experienced a price decline of over 35% since the beginning of December 2024. Source: Trading View This decline has resulted in the formation of a descending triangle pattern on the daily time frame, and THETA is now on the verge of a breakout. Based on historical price momentum, if THETA breaks out of the pattern and closes a daily candle above the $2.41 mark, it could rally by 40% to reach $3.32 in the future. Unlike meme coins, THETA stands out as one of the top AI-based altcoins with the potential to skyrocket in 2025. Filecoin (FIL) Filecoin (FIL) is one of the top AI-based crypto projects that has been consistently attracting attention from crypto enthusiasts, not only for its performance but also for its blockchain-based storage solution. Amid a recent price decline, FIL has experienced a drop of over 40%. Source: Trading View However, the price has recently found support at a crucial level of $4.90 and the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame. Additionally, FIL has paused its continuous decline at the 61.8% Golden Fibonacci zone. Based on the recent price action and these bullish factors, there is a strong possibility that FIL could soar by 65% to reach the $8.20 mark in the future. AIOZ Network (AIOZ) AIOZ, the native token of the AIOZ network, has gained significant attention from crypto enthusiasts following its impressive 240% upside rally last month.

38172649,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631407,1735282800,Affordable Cryptos That Could Turn Small Investments into Fortunes Top Picks for 2025,"As the cryptocurrency market continues to grow, savvy investors are searching for affordable altcoins that offer the potential for massive returns. While high-profile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum often dominate the market, there are numerous lesser-known, low-cost tokens that could yield impressive profits in the coming years. With the right mix of technology, strong community support, and innovative solutions, these cryptocurrencies present exciting opportunities for investors who are willing to take a calculated risk. Among these promising projects is Lightchain AI , an emerging blockchain platform combining artificial intelligence with decentralized networks.

Why Afforadable Cryptos Matter for Investors Affordable cryptocurrencies offer an attractive option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios and potentially maximize profits. While high-priced coins like Bitcoin may have large potential returns, their high cost of entry can deter smaller investors from getting involved. This is where affordable cryptos come into play – they provide a lower barrier to entry, allowing everyday investors to get in on the ground floor of promising projects with huge growth potential. Additionally, investing in affordable cryptos allows for greater risk management. High-priced coins are often subject to extreme volatility, making it difficult for investors to manage their risk exposure. Lower-priced tokens tend to be less volatile and can help balance out a portfolio by reducing overall risk. What to Look for in Affordable Cryptos When considering affordable cryptocurrencies, it’s important to do thorough research and look for key indicators of potential success. Here are a few factors to consider when evaluating these tokens Technology: Look for projects with innovative technology that solves real-world problems or disrupts traditional industries. A strong technological foundation can help a crypto gain traction and attract investors. Community support: The strength and engagement of a project’s community can play a significant role in its success. Keep an eye out for active communication channels, supportive communities, and a dedicated team working towards the project’s goals. Roadmap: A clear roadmap outlining the milestones and goals of a project is crucial in determining its potential growth. A project with a well-defined roadmap and achievable goals is more likely to attract investors and see success.

Accordingly, Bitwise has made a new application to track the stocks of companies that hold at least 1K BTC. Bitwise reported that it has filed an application with the US SEC for a Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF, which aims to track the stock performance of companies with at least 1,000 Bitcoin in their corporate treasuries. At this point, the Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF will invest in companies that hold at least 1,000 Bitcoin. To be included in Bitwise’s ETF, companies holding Bitcoin must also have a market capitalization of at least $100 million, average daily liquidity of at least $1 million, and a free float ratio of less than 10 percent.

The Japanese yen appreciated to around 157.6 per dollar on Friday, but remained near a five-month low, as investors digested Tokyo’s latest inflation data and the Bank of Japan’s December Summary of Opinions. Meanwhile, Japan's economic data presented a mixed outlook: retail sales growth accelerated, industrial production contracted, and the jobless rate remained steady. Japan's housing starts declined by 1.8% year-on-year in November 2024, slowing from a 2.9% drop in the previous month. China ( SHCOMP ) fell -0.04% to 3,393, while the Shenzhen Component rose 0.3% to 10,700 on Friday, as mainland stocks struggled to find clear direction amid investor uncertainty over the government’s stimulus policies.

India ( SENSEX ) rose +0.47% to 78,998 in morning trade on Friday, after being flat the day before, mainly supported by gains in auto, pharmaceuticals, and healthcare sectors. A statement from the government lifted sentiment, as India's economy is expected to grow at around 6.5% in FY 2024/25 despite a challenging environment. The forecasts are close to the lower end of its 6.5%-7% projection, as global uncertainties pose a dampening threat. Australia ( AS51 ) rose +0.50% to finish at 8,262 on Friday, reaching its highest level in over a week and gaining for the 3rd straight session, supported by gains in consumer discretionary, energy, and materials after the Christmas break. The South Korean won plunged further past 1,480 per dollar, hovering at its lowest level in nearly 16 years, as political unrest escalated following an impeachment motion against acting President Han Duck-soo. The vote, set for later today, marks the first time in Korea’s constitutional history that an impeachment motion against an acting president has been brought to a vote in the National Assembly.

His analysis comes following XRP’s historic surge to a multi-year high. The asset is currently consolidating, trading at $2.29. The digital asset experienced massive growth in November 2024, achieving a remarkable increase of almost 300% following the United States presidential election results on November 5th, when Donald Trump secured victory. This surge culminated in XRP almost reaching $2.90 on December 5th, establishing its highest valuation since 2018. Despite the current market correction and price stabilization, Ramos maintains an optimistic outlook. I know – XRP RIPPLE HOLDERS WILL GET RICH – My take, my urgency, the plan – DO IT before $3 $XRP pic.twitter.com/B0TZN1xozp — Oscar Ramos (@realOscarRamos1) December 23, 2024 XRP’s Building Up For Something Big Ramos interprets the present consolidation phase, particularly during the December holiday, as a strategic accumulation opportunity. He attributes the current market stability to reduced trading activity during Christmas, as market participants temporarily shift their focus to seasonal celebrations. When evaluating potential catalysts for XRP’s next significant price movement, Ramos emphasizes the expanding institutional presence in cryptocurrency markets. He references MicroStrategy’s acquisition of 5,262 Bitcoin, valued at $561 million, as evidence of growing institutional confidence in digital assets. According to Ramos, this institutional momentum could generate increased attention across the cryptocurrency sector, potentially benefiting XRP. Ramos also highlights several specific developments that could drive XRP’s value appreciation. Among these factors, the prospective approval of an XRP Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is particularly significant. Multiple companies are already pursuing ETF listings , and Ramos suggests that major financial institutions like BlackRock might explore similar initiatives. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additional Bullish Catalysts for XRP’s Growth Ramos also identified Ripple’s recent launch of RLUSD , its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, as another crucial development. This new financial instrument enhances the XRP ecosystem’s utility and could attract increased enterprise adoption. The analyst anticipates that RLUSD’s growing market presence might catalyze broader institutional and retail participation in the upcoming months. The broader cryptocurrency market context also supports Ramos’s positive outlook. Bitcoin’s surge in late November and early December sent it above $100,000 for the first time, and the broader market has experienced a massive rise, with a current market cap exceeding $3 trillion. Ramos anticipates the cryptocurrency market capitalization will reach $4 trillion, leading to new all-time highs. The overall outlook for the market is bullish, and many experts have big expectations for XRP in 2025. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The pullback from the levels above $98,000 can be treated as a major setback, as this revives the possibility of a yearly close below the $100K milestone. With this, the market participants could become less optimistic in 2025, which may delay the revival of a strong ascending trend, targeting a new ATH above $110K. Bitcoin bulls have pushed the price above $96,000 as the selling volume exhausted to a large extent. Regardless of this, the price is stuck close to the crucial support at $96,071, which keeps the bearish possibilities alive. However, the token remains within the bullish range, with a major support level of around $95,850, where a massive sell-wall has been built. As per the data shared by popular analyst Ali , nearly 822 BTC may be liquidated if the price hits $95,850. Hence, if the price hits this level, there is a possibility of a huge pullback as the sell orders of 822 BTC could be processed. However, there are huge sell orders above the levels between $96,100 and $95,900 where more than 100 BTC are feared to be liquidated at each price range. This suggests the Bitcoin price rally continues to trade within the bearish range, as a minor plunge may trigger a huge sell-off. What’s next? Will BTC price rebound and close the yearly trade above $100K or remain consolidated below the range? The short-term price action of Bitcoin suggests neither bulls nor bears are possessing the required strength as the price remains stuck within a range. However, the technicals suggest a quick surge in the price could occur anytime from now. The stochastic RSI is trading within the oversold range and has been trying to validate a rebound. However, the possibility of a bullish crossover remains distinct as the levels are about to undergo a bearish crossover, suggesting some more price drain before the next price action. Meanwhile, the MACD suggests a drop in the selling pressure, hence suggesting a potential trend reversal. Therefore, the Bitcoin (BTC) price is expected to remain consolidated below $100K until the end of the year, which may attract a significant buying volume in 2025.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-heading-towards-major-support-heres-why-holding-95000-is-very-critical/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
38171839,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398639,1735281626,SpacePay’s Solution: A Deep Dive Into How 0.5% Fees Change Payment Economics,"The post SpacePay’s Solution: A Deep Dive Into How 0.5% Fees Change Payment Economics appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the payment processing sector, fees might seem like small percentages, but their impact on business profits is high. Traditional credit card processors charge merchants between 2.5% and 3.5% per transaction, meaning a store making $10,000 monthly loses up to $350 just in processing fees. SpacePay fundamentally changes this equation with its 0.5% fee structure, allowing merchants to keep more of their earnings while still maintaining profitable platform operations. As presale funding approaches $1 million with tokens at $0.002441, this sustainable economic model attracts both businesses and investors. To understand how SpacePay achieves this balance, think of traditional payment processing like a relay race where each runner (intermediary) takes a portion of the fee. A typical credit card payment passes through six different entities, each adding their costs to the final fee. SpacePay’s technology creates a direct path between customer and merchant, similar to replacing that relay race with a single sprinter. Why Traditional Payment Fees Hurt Business Growth Traditional payment processing creates a complex chain of fees that steadily erodes business profits. Let’s examine a typical credit card transaction: When a customer pays $100, the merchant doesn’t receive $100. Instead, they lose between $2.50 and $3.50 to various processing fees. This might not sound big for a single purchase, but consider how these fees compound over thousands of transactions. To fully understand this impact, imagine a busy coffee shop serving 200 customers daily with an average purchase of $5. With traditional payment processors charging 3%, the shop loses $0.15 on each transaction. Across 200 daily customers, that’s $30 lost to fees every day. Over a month, these fees consume $900 of potential profit – enough to cover utility bills or employee wages. The problem extends beyond visible fees. Traditional payment systems often include hidden costs that further reduce profits. Monthly terminal rental fees typically range from $30-$100 per device. Then there are PCI compliance fees, statement fees, and minimum processing fees. A single store might pay over $1,500 annually just in equipment and maintenance costs before counting per-transaction fees. How SpacePay Creates Sustainable Payment Economics SpacePay’s 0.5% fee structure works because of smart technological design. Consider the same coffee shop from our previous example, now using SpacePay. With 200 daily customers spending $5 each, the shop pays just $0.025 in fees per transaction. This reduces their daily fee cost from $30 to only $5, saving $25 every business day. Over a month, these savings add up to $750 that stays in the business rather than going to payment processors. The revenue distribution model shows how SpacePay maintains profitability while charging lower fees. From each 0.5% transaction fee, the platform allocates portions to different essential functions. Part of the fee supports technical operations and security. Another portion funds the revenue sharing program for token holders. The remaining amount goes toward platform development and growth. This careful distribution ensures every participant in the ecosystem benefits while keeping fees low for merchants. Let’s examine how this works in practice using a retail store example. A clothing store processing $20,000 monthly in traditional card payments currently loses $600-700 in fees. Switching to SpacePay reduces these fees to just $100, saving $500-600 monthly. These savings compound even further because SpacePay eliminates terminal rental fees and other hidden charges. The store can reinvest these savings into inventory, marketing, or staff wages. The platform achieves this efficiency through automated processes. Unlike traditional systems that require multiple intermediaries, SpacePay’s technology handles verification, conversion, and settlement in one seamless operation. This streamlined approach reduces operating costs while maintaining security and speed, proving that efficient technology can make lower fees sustainable for everyone involved. SpacePay’s Major Achievements SpacePay’s success starts with strong private investment backing. The platform secured $750,000 from private investors who recognized its potential to transform payment processing. This early funding provided the foundation for building a secure, efficient payment system. The platform’s technical readiness demonstrates another milestone. SpacePay completed its Minimum Viable Product (MVP), proving the technology works effectively in real-world conditions. The successful development of the payment processing system, merchant dashboard, and security features shows how SpacePay turns its vision into working solutions. Industry recognition came through the “New Payment Platform of the Year” award at the CorporateLiveWire Global Awards 2022/23. This award validates SpacePay’s innovative approach to solving payment challenges. The combination of low fees, instant settlements, and merchant protection caught the attention of payment industry experts. Building Economic Value Through Community SpacePay’s approach to value creation extends beyond simple fee savings. The platform’s presale success, now approaching $1 million with tokens at $0.002441 , demonstrates how combining payment efficiency with community benefits creates lasting economic value. Think of it as building a financial ecosystem where every participant – from small merchants to token holders – contributes to and benefits from the network’s growth. The revenue sharing program shows this collaborative economics. When merchants process payments through SpacePay, a portion of the 0.5% fee flows back to token holders. To understand how this works, consider a network processing $1 million daily in transactions. The total fees would generate $5,000 daily, with a major portion distributed among the community. This creates a direct link between platform usage and token holder rewards, encouraging everyone to support network growth. The upcoming staking program adds another layer of economic benefit. Token holders who stake their SPY tokens will earn regular rewards from platform activity. Participating in this economic ecosystem starts at SpacePay’s website.

At Thailand’s Khao Kheow Open Zoo, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin made headlines when he adopted Moo Deng, a juvenile pygmy hippopotamus. A $10 million Thai Baht ($290,000) donation to the zoo’s conservation efforts is part of this heartwarming gesture. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Hit $4? Expert Sets Prediction For Breakout Timing News of the adoption raised MOODENG token values over 70%, suggesting growing interest in meme coins. Following the news, trading volume surged by 380%, implying that fresh investors jumped in to join the thrill around this special digital asset. Source: CoinMarketCap MOODENG Crypto Price Shoots Up The price of MOODENG rapidly increased from approximately $0.0001228 to $0.0002417 within a matter of hours, illustrating the rapidity with which market sentiment can fluctuate in response to positive news. Currently, the token is trading at approximately $0.0001958, which is a significant increase from its previous levels. Beyond just providing financial assistance, Buterin has committed to adopting Moo Deng and her family for a two-year period as part of the zoo’s Wildlife Sponsorship Program. This project not only demonstrates his dedication to animal welfare but also positions him as a well-known crypto industry figure who supports humanitarian programs. Thank you Vitalik Buterin @VitalikButerin for joining the Wildlife Sponsorship Program and adopting Moo Deng with a generous gift of 10,000,000 THB for her family! We look forward to working with you over the next 2 years for the benefit of the Khao Kheow Open Zoo community & all… pic.twitter.com/Ykrr53Y2tZ — สวนสัตว์เปิดเขาเขียว Khao Kheow Open Zoo (@KhaokheowZoo) December 26, 2024 Contribution To Charity Buterin’s philanthropic efforts are well-documented. He has donated large sums of money to a number of causes in the past, including funding efforts and contributions to the fight against COVID-19 within the Ethereum network. His latest donation to Moo Deng is one of the best examples through which cryptocurrency can be leveraged for social good. Buterin stated his happiness about becoming the adoptive father of Moo Deng and underscored the importance of conservation efforts. The donation will be disbursed in two installments: an immediate payment of 5 million THB, with the balance to be paid within one year. This systematic method guarantees that the zoo can efficiently organize its conservation initiatives while simultaneously improving Moo Deng’s environment.

The Road Ahead For Meme Coins The rise of MOODENG highlights a fascinating trend in the cryptosphere: meme coins are becoming platforms for philanthropic activities and community involvement as well as speculative assets. Buterin’s involvement has cultivated a perception of genuine community involvement and social responsibility, despite the fact that many view these tokens with skepticism due to their volatility. The increased awareness of MOODENG’s association with animal welfare and Buterin’s philanthropic background may serve as a catalyst for other cryptocurrencies to emulate them.

38171753,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53219,1735281035,Traders Eye Crypto Market Dip As Buying Opportunity For Sui and Dogecoin As They Rack Up Rollblock,"The recent market correction has caused coin prices to drop significantly. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Sui (SUI) are particularly affected, as evident in their price dips. This is happening after the late November to early December rally in the crypto market that pushed coins like Bitcoin and SUI to new highs. The recent decline provides an opportunity for investors to stack up both SUI and DOGE ahead of an anticipated crypto market rally in 2025. Meanwhile, many investors are also turning to Rollblock, a new casino token causing FOMO after raising over $7.6 million in its presale . Let’s find out why Rollblock is attracting crypto traders and investors. Rollblock attracts traders and gamers during presale While SUI and DOGE have been battling the broader crypto market decline, Rollblock has been moving upward since its presale began. The Rollblock presale has raised $7.6 million within a few months, causing FOMO among investors and traders. The increased interest in the Rollblock project is due to its exciting online gambling and DeFi investing features. The Rollblock Casino is the ecosystem’s online gambling arm. It features thousands of players’ favorite casino games, providing an opportunity for active players to wager with the RBLK token for potential winnings. The DeFi investment arm of the project is prominent via its staking feature, offering up to 30% returns per annum. Moreover, there’s a revenue-sharing system for token holders to get a percentage of the casino’s weekly income as extra earnings. SUI loses steam after hitting a new all-time high SUI had one of its major highlights this year, reaching an all-time high price of $4.91 on December 16. SUI has returned over 500% profit to its investors this year alone. However, the slight fall in the current SUI price has seen it trading at around $4.50 at the time of writing. The fall in the SUI price coincides with a bearish sentiment in the general crypto market. The SUI price is still testing stability and key support levels. So, it may regain momentum if higher resistance isn’t very strong. Conversely, low support levels will drag down the SUI price , which will affect its investors. However, long-term investors can back SUI at its current low price and hope for bigger gains. DOGE dips by over 25% in the past month Like SUI, the ongoing bearish sentiment in the global crypto market has negatively impacted meme coins like Dogecoin. DOGE flew high between late November and early December 2024. However, the DOGE price has now fallen by over 25% in the past month. The reduced demand for DOGE has also resulted in the meme coin’s trading volume falling by over 16% in the last 24 hours. As of the time of writing, DOGE is valued at around $0.31, making it an affordable investment opportunity for crypto traders and investors before an anticipated Dogecoin rally in 2025. However, investors are doubtful about the possibility of DOGE reaching higher highs based on its lack of utility. Conclusion The Rollblock presale is currently in stage 9 and valued at $0.044. With at least a 15% increase in the next stage and bigger potential after its full launch, now is a good time to buy the dip on Rollblock.

38171291,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398620,1735280510,XRP Price Prediction For December 27,"The post XRP Price Prediction For December 27 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP has recently experienced a dip into a key support region between $2.40 and $2.20. This area saw some initial price reaction on Sunday and Monday this week, but the response hasn’t been strong enough to suggest a clear upward move just yet. At the current price levels, XRP is showing signs of consolidation. If the price holds above the $2.40 support level, there could be a chance for a rebound. However, if it falls below $2.20, this could signal a more significant decline in the near term. Key Support and Resistance Levels A price move up from here could target the $2.59 level, which represents a typical resistance point. If XRP reaches this level, it might face challenges breaking through and could form a consolidation before moving higher. After testing $2.59, it’s possible that the price could revisit lower levels around $2.11 or $2.04 before attempting to move up again. A break of this support could suggest further downside potential, with the price possibly reaching levels between $1.39 and $1.80. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple’s Upcoming 1 Billion XRP Unlock: Will It Impact the Price? , Upside Breakout Confirmation The key resistance to watch is around $2.73, the swing high from December 17th. A break above this level would likely trigger a more direct upward move, with the potential for XRP to test its all-time highs . Overall, XRP is at a crucial point, and the next few moves will depend heavily on the ability to maintain support at $2.40. A break below this level would shift the focus to lower price targets, while a break above $2.73 would signal a bullish continuation. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, not much has changed and XRP is still trading within a descending parallel channel, which hints at a short-term bearish trend, with lower highs and lower lows. The support line for this channel is around $1.90, while the resistance is around $2.60. The center line is at approximately $2.22. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

38170953,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398601,1735279767,Next Crypto to Explode? Meme Index (MEMEX) Raises $450K in Presale for First Decentralized Meme Coin Index,"The post Next Crypto to Explode? Meme Index (MEMEX) Raises $450K in Presale for First Decentralized Meme Coin Index appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The festive season did wonders for Meme Index ($MEMEX) , as it smashed through the $450K milestone in its presale just after Christmas. Meme Index is a unique platform that offers the first-ever decentralized index for meme coins. Rather than just investing in a single token, Meme Index bundles numerous tokens into four baskets, each with a different risk and upside profile. Instead of betting on a single token, investors can choose an index—or multiple indexes—to determine how aggressive or conservative they’d like to be. The whole platform is built around its native $MEMEX governance token, which is currently live in presale. Currently, $MEMEX is priced at just $0.0146285, but it will increase within 48 hours when the next presale phase starts. A Strong Year for Meme Coins One of the biggest crypto trends of the year has been the rise of meme coins, with the sector collectively reaching a value of $137 billion at one point. Some of the hottest meme coins, like Pepe ($PEPE) and Mog Coin ($MOG), saw an over 1,200% upside in 2024 alone. There are also lesser-known projects like Peanut the Squirrel ($PNUT), which blew the market away with a 2,000% gain since November. While these successes are hard to ignore, they also reveal how volatile meme coins can be. That’s where the Meme Index comes in. It helps investors hedge their bets by diversifying risk into various coins rather than concentrating their investment on a single bet. One Governance Token for Four Indexes As we saw above, Meme Index has four indexes. $MEMEX holders govern all four indexes and any future updates. If a new meme coin takes off and the community wants to add it to an index, $MEMEX token holders can propose and vote on it. Each index has a different level of risk and upside. Investors can choose a level of risk that aligns with their objectives. For instance, the Titan Index concentrates on the top 10 meme coins with a market cap exceeding $1 billion (such as DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE). While it provides exposure to established meme coins, it still carries more volatility than standard large-cap cryptos. It could be the right choice if you want to avoid more obscure meme tokens. Conversely, the Moonshot Index features coins that are either listed or about to be listed on top exchanges but have yet to attain a $1 billion market cap. This is ideal for those who want to gain exposure to growing coins without investing too heavily in speculative projects. Next on the list is the Midcap Index . It includes meme coins with a market cap between $50 and $250 million. This tier can bring high reward potential if a token moves up to the next tier, though it comes with added volatility. The last one is the Meme Frenzy Index , a high-stakes basket of brand-new meme coins that may soar to the moon or crash to the ground in days. This option is suitable for high-risk-taking investors chasing exponential gains and certainly not for those playing safe. How to Buy $MEMEX With over $450,000 raised in the presale in just a few days, many early supporters are confident that the project can stand out in the meme coin space. Per the Meme Index whitepaper , the total supply of $MEMEX tokens is limited to 15 billion. The platform has allocated 15% of these tokens to early buyers for the ongoing presale. You can visit the official Meme Index presale page to buy $MEMEX. You can connect a compatible crypto wallet by clicking ‘Connect Wallet’ and pay with $USDT, $ETH, $BNB, or a credit card. Buyers can then directly stake these tokens via the Meme Index staking protocol . The APY is currently over 3,900%. Although this rate will decrease once more participants start staking, it offers an attractive option for $MEMEX holders who want to earn high passive rewards. It’s worth noting that security has been a top priority for Meme Index. It has audited its smart contracts by Coinsult and SolidProof, where both firms flagged no critical vulnerabilities. You can join the Meme Index community on Telegram and follow its X account to keep up with the latest news and project updates.

38170756,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398603,1735279366,"Ethereum Price to Rally Toward $5,232 as Open Interest Hits ATH","The post Ethereum Price to Rally Toward $5,232 as Open Interest Hits ATH appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum (ETH) price retraced more than 15 percent in the past two weeks to trade at about $3,375 on Friday, December 27, during the early European session. As a result, the large-cap altcoin, with a total valuation of about $406 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $23 billion, rebounded from a crucial support level. With the TOTAL2 having already retested the previous all-time high (ATH), around $1.6 trillion, Ethereum price is well positioned to rally towards $5k soon. Moreover, the ETH/BTC pair has been forming a macro reversal pattern, coupled with the bullish divergence on the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI). Ethereum Whales Prepares for Major Uproar With Bitcoin price having outperformed the majority of large and mid-cap altcoins in the past two years, whale crypto investors have been repositioning their portfolios in preparation for a parabolic altseason. Moreover, the Ethereum’s Open Interest (OI) and volume recently surged to a new ATH of above $23 billion. According to on-chain data analysis provided by Coinglass, the overall supply of Ethereum on centralized exchanges declined from 16.12 million on November 29, to hover about 15.3 million at the time of this writing. The notable decline of Ethereum on CEXes is majorly attributed to the rising demand from the U.S. spot Ether ETF issuers. Led by BlackRock’s ETHA, and Fidelity’s FETH, the US spot Ether ETF issuers have attracted more than $2.64 billion in cumulative total net inflow since inception, thus a total assets under management of about $12.01 billion. On Thursday, the US spot Ether ETFs registered net cash inflows of about $117 million and a total value traded of around $390 million. Meanwhile, on-chain data analysis shows a while investors withdrew 1,500 Ether, worth $5.21 million, from Binance in the last 24 hours. Ethereum rebounds from crucial support, setting the stage for a potential rally. Read Ethereum price prediction for the latest market insights! What Next? From a technical analysis standpoint, Ethereum price has rebounded from a falling logarithmic trend, which formed year-to-date, thus signaling potential bullish uproar in the near term. Furthermore, Ethereum price has held above the weekly 50 Moving Average in the past two months. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price To Crash Hard To $60K!

38170672,https://square.htx.com/?p=42214,1735279177,"HTX Futures Gains Momentum: SmartEarn Achieves Instant Success in Its First Month, Three New Products Poised to Deliver More Surprises","2024 has been a landmark year for the cryptocurrency industry. As one of the most established crypto trading platforms, HTX has consistently strived for breakthroughs, leading the industry development with premium products and services. The futures business has been a key focus for the platform this year. Through sustained efforts, HTX has achieved significant progress in this domain. Data shows that the platform’s total futures trading volume in 2024 has reached approximately $900 billion so far, representing a 70% increase compared to 2023. Additionally, the scale of futures trading exhibited a steady month-over-month growth trend. The success stems from two factors. On the one hand, HTX’s team has stayed ahead by closely following the latest market trends and hotspots, continually expanding its asset map. Over the year, the platform listed more than 80 new futures trading assets, with nearly 70 of them experiencing growth rates exceeding 200%. By December 2024, HTX had supported over 160 futures trading assets, providing users with a diverse range of trading options. On the other hand, HTX’s proactive optimization and bold innovations in futures products have played a pivotal role in its growth. Notably, the introduction of its exclusive product, “SmartEarn,” has redefined industry standards while presenting users with unique revenue opportunities. SmartEarn Draws Over 260,000 Users, Becoming an Instant Hit SmartEarn, a pioneering Earn product created by HTX, officially launched on November 14. It enables users to earn a 6% annual percentage yield (APY) on the assets in their Futures account, regardless of whether they are holding a position or not. SmartEarn’s zero-threshold requirement, high flexibility, and high yield perfectly align with the needs of futures users, making it an instant success. As of December 26, just over a month since its launch, SmartEarn has attracted more than 260,000 users. Offering a 6% APY on funds in Futures accounts and the lowest funding rate for futures positions, SmartEarn empowers HTX’s futures business with a significant boost. The total futures trading volume has increased by 88% over the past 30 days, and the Q4 futures trading volume has surged by 50% compared to Q3. Users have also reaped significant benefits, with the highest individual earnings for SmartEarn users reaching up to 24,641 USDT. In addition to launching this groundbreaking product, HTX continues to enhance its existing features. In 2024, HTX completed more than 30 upgrades to its futures services, including TP/SL price protection and real-time position updates. In an effort to improve the user experience, HTX has launched 15 enhancements to its futures copy trading product, including the ability for users to follow multiple lead traders and optimize the trader ranking system. As of November 2024, the user base of HTX’s copy trading has experienced a remarkable growth of over 700% compared to the start of the year. Today, HTX Futures, powered by an outstanding user experience and with SmartEarn as its flagship product, have become a major player in the highly competitive field of crypto derivatives. Year-End Highlights: Three New Futures Products Scheduled for Successive Launches As 2024 winds down, HTX is still ramping up efforts to enhance user experiences. Right now, three new futures products have either gone live or are arriving soon. Zero-Cost Futures Position Event Recently, HTX launched the Zero-Cost Futures Position Event to offer newcomers an effortless entry into futures trading. This event offers free futures positions. By participating, users will receive predefined positions, including specific trading pairs, leverage, direction, and size. This allows them to get accustomed to futures trading mechanics and gain hands-on experience in a live trading environment. If a user’s position results in a profit, the gains will be credited as Futures Trial Bonuses to their Futures account, offering opportunities for future gains. However, losses in this position will not affect their account balance. Futures Grid HTX is set to upgrade its futures grid functionality by the end of December, offering users a smarter, strategy-based trading tool. This upgrade boosts capital efficiency while minimizing risk, making it well-suited for seizing opportunities in volatile markets. Once users set their futures grid parameters, the bot will handle the execution, freeing them from the need to monitor the tiny changes in the tickers. What’s even better, HTX charges no extra fees for this service. Multi-Assets Collateral for Futures Trading Around Lunar New Year 2025, HTX will launch Multi-Assets Collateral for Futures Trading, allowing traders to use multiple assets as collateral for trading the USDT-M futures. This new feature will provide a more convenient trading experience, especially for users trading futures with multiple assets. 2024 has seen HTX achieve impressive results in boosting the competitiveness of its futures products. The success of SmartEarn, coupled with the substantial growth in futures trading volume and the number of futures traders, stands as a testament to user recognition of HTX’s efforts. This recognition has been a key driver of HTX’s innovation. Looking ahead to 2025, HTX will continue to optimize its futures services and products, focusing on enhancing core trading functions and the copy trading section. More efforts will be made to increase liquidity, with a particular focus on strengthening the market depth of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other popular cryptos to ensure a smoother trading experience. Furthermore, HTX will continue to drive the comprehensive development of its ecosystem. By delivering exceptional user experiences, generating wealth effects, implementing robust security strategies, and deploying cutting-edge technologies, the platform will solidify its leading position in the cryptocurrency industry. In 2025, HTX is poised to outperform expectations.

38170608,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398587,1735279016,Bitcoin Price To Crash Hard To $60K! Experts Warn of Major Crash,"The post Bitcoin Price To Crash Hard To $60K! Experts Warn of Major Crash appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin’s price has been struggling recently, experiencing a noticeable decline over the past two weeks. As BTC dropped to $95,120 , the crypto enthusiast is in fear of a massive crash ahead. A prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared that several prominent figures in the crypto industry have warned that Bitcoin’s price could potentially fall to $60K. Drop Below $95K Could Trigger Crash Ali Martinez highlights a prediction from Tone Vays, a well-respected figure in the crypto space. Vays warns that if Bitcoin’s price falls below $95,000, it could set the stage for a sharp correction down to around $73,000. Some investors are already preparing for this possibility. In fact, over the past week, more than 33,000 Bitcoins , worth around $3.23 billion, were moved to exchanges, suggesting that traders are preparing for further decline. A Repeat of the 2018 Crash? Another notable figure mentioned by Martinez is Peter Brant, a veteran trader who famously predicted the Bitcoin crash in 2018. Brant has voiced concerns that Bitcoin might break below a key technical pattern, the expanding triangle, which could lead to a drop to around $70,000. Hey trolls — this is not a prediction. Just always pointing out possibilities, not probabilities, not certainties. No screen shot is necessary $BTCA right angled broadening triangle could project back into the 70s and a test of the parabolic modality pic.twitter.com/n5sy6DxAMb — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 20, 2024 Interestingly, on December 23rd alone, Bitcoin saw over $7.1 billion in realized profits, which could indicate that many traders are capitalizing on the current volatility. Could Bitcoin Hit $60,000? Martinez also brings up predictions from Mark Newton, Managing Director at Fundstrat, and analyst Benjamin Cohen. Both have expressed concerns that Bitcoin’s price could eventually fall to the $60,000 range. Cohen suggests Bitcoin’s price could follow a similar path to other assets like the QQQ, which could result in a crash around the time of political events, such as on Donald Trump’s presidential oath days. Yet, Bullish Hope for Bitcoin! Despite the bearish predictions, out that Bitcoin recently broke a key support level at $97,300. For the bearish outlook to be avoided, Bitcoin would need to rise above this level and stay above $100,000. If this happens, Bitcoin could see a new rise, with some experts predicting prices could reach $168,500. Amidst fears of a crypto crash, Bitcoin’s Fear and Greed Index remains in the “Greed” zone at 74. This suggests that some traders are still hopeful and believe Bitcoin could experience a massive breakout soon. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/musk-fuks-santa-muskfsan-solana-memecoin-to-surge-19000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-as-shib-and-bonk-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
38172087,https://invezz.com/?p=2406945,1735278766,Bitcoin drops to $96K while altcoins mirror market decline; BGB token defies the trend,"The cryptocurrency market experienced another volatile day, with Bitcoin (BTC) retreating to $96,000 and major altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP following suit with notable declines. However, amidst the market-wide slump, Bitget’s BGB token stood out, surging 22% and capturing investor attention. The global crypto market cap dropped by 2.5% over the past 24 hours, settling at $3.34 trillion. Trading volumes, however, climbed 5% to $123.46 billion, indicating heightened activity. Bitcoin (BTC) down 2.5% Bitcoin’s price fell 2.5% in the last 24 hours, trading at $96,029 with a low of $95,137 and a high of $98,973. Despite the downturn, BTC maintained its dominance at 57.05%. Analysts suggest the recent dip is tied to broader macroeconomic concerns, including the US Federal Reserve’s hawkish policies. Adding to the optimism for BTC, American energy management company KULR recently invested $21 million in the cryptocurrency, signaling continued institutional interest. However, market experts warn of potential corrections, with some predicting a drop to $80,000 soon. Ethereum (ETH) slips 3% Ethereum mirrored Bitcoin’s dip, slipping 2% to $3,374. Its 24-hour range hovered between $3,302 and $3,446. Futures data revealed a slight increase in open interest to $23.47 billion, while derivatives trading volumes surged 29% to $35.69 billion. This mixed sentiment highlights Ethereum’s resilience amid broader market turbulence. SOL and XRP decline too Solana’s price fell nearly 3%, trading at $190.31 with an intraday range of $186.86 to $195.27. Futures data showed a 3% drop in open interest, while derivatives volumes climbed 24%. Despite the dip, Solana remains a strong contender, with long-term price targets of $400-$500 according to analysts. XRP dropped 3.5% to $2.18, with a day’s low of $2.13 and a high of $2.25. While the ongoing Ripple legal saga has buoyed community sentiment, short-term volatility continues to impact XRP’s price trajectory. Analysts speculate a potential surge to $27 in the coming months. Meme tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) followed the market trend, declining 3% and 2%, respectively. Meanwhile, Bitget Token (BGB) defied the bearish sentiment, soaring 22% to $7.67. Other gainers included FTX Token (FTT), up 8%, and GateToken (GT), up 5%. Among the top losers, MOVE and HBAR dipped 8%, while Fantom (FTM) slid 7%. Despite the current market downturn, hourly gains of 0.06% and 0.15% for BTC and ETH indicate stabilization. Market participants are now watching for a recovery as experts maintain that the bull cycle is far from over.

38170005,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53216,1735277422,XRP Bulls Defend Key Support Region As Lunex Network Eyes a $1 Breakout – Can Tron Surpass $1 in 2025?,"Ripple has been showing resilience amid the ongoing downtrend within the crypto market. XRP’s price has remained above the $2 region despite the bear’s attempts to push it to former lows. Despite a sharp dip on Friday, when the price dipped below the $2 level, sending FUD among investors, XRP still enjoys an over 40% monthly surge. Similarly, Tron has steadily risen, aiming to surpass $1 by 2025. Tron price movement has already recorded a monthly surge of over 13% with a YTD of 135%. Like Ripple and Tron, Lunex Network is also eying impressive gains, increasing 300% to hit the $0.0048 price target. This remarkable gain has been attributed to the project’s unique features, which include a no-KYC check. Lunex Network’s No KYC Requirement Lures More Investors Lunex Network is set to disrupt the DeFi market with a no-KYC check approach to decentralized finance. Unlike most projects associated with invasive KYC policies, Lunex Network aims to provide users with the best level of privacy, allowing them to stake, trade, and manage their assets efficiently. This unique approach will help simplify the Lunex onboarding process while making the DeFi space more open and diverse. Lunex Network also elevates users’ experiences with cross-chain solutions, allowing them to swap over 50K tokens across 40-plus blockchains. This unique feature allows users to carry out transactions quickly and at a lower cost than other platforms. Currently, the LNEX token is priced at $0.0048, a significant rally from its starting price of just $0.0012. The project has collected over $5.5M in presale revenue and is targeting $6M by the end of 2024. Its unique features, including anonymity, decentralization, and security, place it in a better position to gain more in Q1 of 2025. Ripple Bulls Outshine The Bears Ripple’s bulls managed to overcome the bears, forcing a reversal in XRP’s price . This move confirms Ripple’s strong support, which could increase its price. Its relative strength index is also above the midline, meaning the bulls are still in charge. Additionally, the debut of XRP’s anticipated RLUSD stablecoin added fuel to the crypto’s price movement. Ripple is also in talks with Bitstamp about plans to build a derivatives exchange on Ripple’s Ledger, which might boost XRP’s price in 2025. The Fibonacci retracement levels of 0.382, 0.5, and 0.618 are also critical in identifying XRP’s resistance and support levels during its correction period. A breakout above its triangle pattern could signal bullish momentum, targeting previous highs. According to CryptoFayZ ’s price prediction for XRP, the token’s bullish breakout might see it hit $5 soon. Tron Hits Record Revenue While Eying the $1 Milestone by 2025 Tron recorded $21.66M in revenue on December 3, 2024. This impressive accomplishment led to widespread attention, boosting the demand for Tron. The growth of altcoin, hovering within the $0.24 region , has been remarkable. Since Tron’s launch in 2017, when the RTX token was priced at just $0.0019 during presale, the altcoin has already delivered exceptional returns. This unique performance highlights the transformative opportunities that early investments in cryptocurrency can offer. Its technical indicators including the relative strength index at 47, however, point to a neutral position. Despite this, its growing adoption and network developments could help Tron’s price achieve a $1 milestone in 2025. Its impressive performance and increasing revenue streams position Tron’s future in the positive, making it a standout option for investors seeking massive returns in 2025. Will LNEX Match Ripple and Tron Price Movements? Ripple and Tron are among the top altcoins with the unique ability to record significant growth in 2025. Nonetheless, Lunex Network’s no-KYC feature and unique cross-chain swap feature put it in a better position to enjoy more substantial gains and attract more investors while eying the $1 region.

38169849,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398585,1735277373,BONK’s $52M Token Burn : Is a 30% Rally on the Horizon?,"The post BONK’s $52M Token Burn : Is a 30% Rally on the Horizon? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News BONK, one of Solana’s popular meme tokens, is trading at $0.000031 , close to its one-month low. This marks a significant drop from its November 22 peak of $0.000053. Open interest in BONK has also fallen to $8.32 million, the lowest in three months, as traders shift their focus to other assets. Despite these setbacks, BONK remains a low-cost token with a strong community and hopes of regaining its top spot in the meme token market . Based on community participation in Burnmas, the amended vote has passed and 1.69 Trillion $BONK has been burnt from the @bonk_dao multisig The Total Supply of $BONK is now down to 91 Trillion Tokens from it's original 100 Trillion #LetsBONK — BONK!!! (@bonk_inu) December 26, 2024 Massive Token Burn to Revive Interest In a big move to boost its value, Bonk DAO burned 1.69 trillion tokens, reducing the total supply from 100 trillion to 91 trillion. This burn, worth over $52 million, was approved by 99% of the community and completed in a single Solana transaction. The burn was part of BONK’s second-anniversary celebration, aiming to reduce supply and make the token more valuable. Community Participation The token burn campaign, which ran from November 15 to December 25, involved the community through social media activities and collaborations with ecosystem partners. Bonk DAO’s wallet still holds 9% of the total supply, making it the largest holder, even surpassing Binance. Additionally, 4.8% of the supply is locked in staking pools, further limiting the number of tokens in circulation. Challenges and Competition Despite this significant token burn, BONK’s price has not seen a major rally. Newer Solana meme tokens like Pudgy Penguins’ PENGU and DogWifHat (WIF) are gaining popularity . PENGU, with a market cap of $2.4 billion, has surpassed BONK as the leading Solana meme token . However, BONK remains optimistic about its future, banking on its strong community, wide presence across 11 chains, and listings on major exchanges. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Dogecoin Following the Bullish Pattern—Here’s When the DOGE Price May Hit a New ATH at $5 , Current Market Sentiment BONK’s market sentiment is currently neutral, with the Fear & Greed Index showing “Greed,” indicating growing trader interest.

Global cryptocurrency market capitalization stood at $3.42 trillion, reflecting a 0.26% dip. Recent volatility is attributed to ETF outflows totaling $1.52 billion over the past four days, signaling institutional caution, while bullish news such as Russia’s plan to adopt BTC in foreign trade supports positive sentiment. Despite these dynamics, BTC has faced resistance at $98,300, with support levels forming at $94,735 and $92,105. Analysts point to Bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500, growing Ether ETF inflows worth $2.5 billion, and MicroStrategy’s aggressive buying strategy as key indicators for Bitcoin’s medium-term outlook. MicroStrategy’s $42 Billion Expansion Sparks Bullish Hopes MicroStrategy is poised to reshape Bitcoin’s demand landscape with its bold $42 billion expansion strategy . The company seeks shareholder approval to raise $21 billion each through equity and debt to fund large-scale BTC purchases. Its “21/21 Plan” aims to enhance its BTC holdings significantly, with a December purchase of 42,000 BTC worth $4 billion already completed. This aggressive approach has propelled MicroStrategy into the Nasdaq 100 and bolstered institutional confidence in BTC. While MicroStrategy’s current yield on BTC holdings is 17.8%, the company plans to moderate this to 6-10% by 2027, reflecting a balanced growth strategy. Analysts anticipate that the company’s continued buying spree will exert upward pressure on BTC prices, supporting a potential rally. Israel Enters Bitcoin Mutual Funds Market Israel’s imminent launch of six BTC mutual funds by December 31 represents a major milestone in crypto adoption. Approved by the Israel Securities Authority (ISA), these funds cater to growing local demand for crypto investments. Managed by firms like Migdal Capital Markets and Phoenix Investment, the funds offer management fees between 0.25% and 1.5% and allow transactions in the local shekel currency. This initiative coincides with Israel’s push for digital finance innovation, including its central bank digital currency (CBDC) project. Globally, BTC-focused investment products have gained traction, with U.S. Bitcoin ETFs attracting $6.7 billion in inflows in December alone. Analysts believe Israel’s BTC mutual funds will boost local investor participation and institutional confidence, potentially fueling Bitcoin’s global adoption.

Salame and Ellison pleaded guilty to the charges against them, which were criminal fraud charges and seven federal counts of fraud and conspiracy, respectively. With their guilty plea, they saved themselves and the prosecution from a lengthy trial process. Both of them pleaded guilty in 2023 and were sentenced this year in May. Rewarding the cooperation of the fraudulent FTX execs In the federal prison system, inmates can earn sentence reductions through good behavior and participation in rehabilitation programs. Ellison was sentenced to two years in prison. She began her sentence at the Danbury Federal Correctional Institution on November 7. She was scheduled to be released in October of 2026, but prison records state that her release date is now July 20, 2026. The new release date is more than three months shy of two years. Ellison’s attorneys declined to comment, but the early release can be attributed to the fact that Ellison was a star witness in the criminal trial against her ex-boyfriend, Sam Bankman-Fried. Salame was sentenced to 7.5 years in federal prison and began his sentence in October. He was due for release in April of 2032, but now his release date, as listed on the Federal Bureau of Prisons website, is March 1, 2031. This new date is over a year earlier than his initial release schedule. Salame’s attorneys have also not commented on the matter. However, a spokesperson of the Bureau of Prisons stated that incarcerated individuals could earn time off their sentences for good behavior under the 2018 First Step Act, according to a Business Insider report. Singh, who was arrested alongside the other executives, assisted the prosecution and testified against Bankman-Fried. He got no prison time. The infamous FTX implosion 2022 Before it went bankrupt, FTX was a leading crypto exchange globally, while its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), had achieved near superstar status, making waves even in political circles. The exchange platform was associated and endorsed by public figures and it was believed to be the gold standard for safe and secure cryptocurrency trading. The platform quickly collapsed in 2022 when users pulled their funds following rumors about FTX’s improper ties to Alameda Research. SBF was the CEO of FTX, and his girlfriend at the time, Caroline Ellison, led Alameda Research, a crypto hedge fund founded by Bankman-Fried before the creation of FTX. After the collapse of FTX, Bankman-Fried, his girlfriend Caroline Ellison, Ryan Salame and Nishad Singh were all promptly arrested on criminal fraud charges. The mastermind behind the operation, Sam Bankman-Fried, was sentenced to 25 years in prison. The prison records currently have no date listed for his release.

You don’t just buy coins and hope they go up anymore. Strive Asset Manager, a firm founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, is pushing the boundaries with a new kind of fund. They’ve filed for a Bitcoin Bond ETF, which could let investors profit from companies that are big on Bitcoin—without directly owning any. Strive files for “Bitcoin Bond” ETF… Would seek exposure to convertible securities issued by MicroStrategy. pic.twitter.com/ybJjbVFWUN — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 26, 2024 If that sounds a bit confusing, don’t worry. The idea is actually pretty simple. Companies like MicroStrategy have been using bonds to invest in Bitcoin for years. Strive wants to bring that strategy to investors like you. What Exactly Are Bitcoin Bonds? Bitcoin bonds aren’t actually Bitcoin. They’re more like loans companies take out. MicroStrategy, for example, issues bonds to raise cash, which they then use to buy Bitcoin. These bonds are interesting because they can turn into shares of the company later. It’s a risky move, but for MicroStrategy, it’s been a jackpot. Their stock has soared over 2,200% since 2020. Strive’s ETF wants to jump into this space. Instead of just buying Bitcoin, the fund would invest in these bonds. It’s an active approach, meaning managers make decisions on which bonds to pick. They might also use tools like swaps and options to maximize returns. Source : SEC Edgar The fees haven’t been announced yet, but actively managed funds typically cost more than regular index funds. Whether or not that’s worth it will depend on how the Bitcoin bond ETF performs. Politics and Crypto: How Does Ramaswamy Fit In? Let’s talk about Vivek Ramaswamy for a second. He’s not just some Wall Street guy. He’s also a major political player. In 2023, he ran against Donald Trump in the Republican primaries. After losing, he turned around and endorsed Trump. Now, the two seem to be working toward a common goal—making the U.S. a leader in innovation, including crypto. Under Trump, the crypto world has seen some big shifts. Former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins is set to lead the SEC, and David Sacks, PayPal’s ex-COO, has been named “AI and Crypto Czar.” These moves suggest a friendlier attitude toward crypto, which could make it easier for funds like Strive’s ETF to get approved. What’s Next for Bitcoin Investors? If Strive’s ETF gets the green light for the Bitcoin bind ETF, it could open the door for a new wave of Bitcoin investors. Instead of dealing with the ups and downs of owning Bitcoin directly, people can invest in bonds tied to the cryptocurrency. It’s less risky in some ways, but still gives exposure to Bitcoin’s growth. This isn’t just about one fund, though. It’s part of a bigger trend of blending traditional finance with the crypto world. As more companies adopt Bitcoin into their strategies, tools like this ETF could make it easier for everyday investors to get involved. This shows how Bitcoin is making its place in the financial world. Just recently, Bitwise filed for ETF that tracks Corporate giants with heavy Bitcoin in their books.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/strives-bitcoin-bond-etf-a-bold-new-investment/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

This optimistic outlook is driven by India’s progressive efforts to create frameworks that build trust, boost innovation, and expand blockchain use. India’s Growing Importance in Crypto Regulation India’s growing role in cryptocurrency regulation is gaining attention, especially as 2024 marked major advancements in crypto adoption and institutional interest, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of $108K . One of the defining moments was the U.S. approval of spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Therefore, Vishal Sacheendran, Head of Regional Markets at Binance, believes India will take the lead in global crypto regulation by 2025, helping to build trust and support growth in the industry. Sacheendran also highlighted Binance’s efforts to keep up with India’s changing rules. The company has been working to grow its presence in the country, showing its commitment to offering safe and legal crypto services. Sacheendran further notes that the future of crypto is not just about trading but about creating a decentralized and innovative digital ecosystem that benefits everyone. India’s Shifting Stance Towards Crypto India’s journey toward crypto regulation began in 2019 with a draft bill proposing a complete ban on cryptocurrencies. However, this bill was never presented in Parliament, and over time, India’s approach became less strict, influenced by global trends. During a recent Parliament session , Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has advised the government to create rules for cryptocurrencies. Still, the government believes that any ban would need global cooperation. However, the government has also introduced taxes on virtual assets. A 30% tax on crypto profits began on April 1, followed by a 1% TDS from July 1. These rules have caused a drop in trading activity on crypto exchanges in India.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | BNB,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/india-to-lead-crypto-regulation-by-2025-says-binance/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

38178791,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322936,1735274794,Vivek Ramaswamy-Founded Strive Files for ETF Focused on Bitcoin-Linked Convertible Bonds,"Strive, an asset management firm founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, has filed with U.S. regulators to launch an exchange-traded fund (ETF) aimed at investing in Bitcoin-linked convertible bonds. According to a December 26 filing , the proposed Strive Bitcoin Bond ETF will target securities issued by companies like MicroStrategy, which have used proceeds from convertible bonds to purchase Bitcoin as part of their corporate treasury strategies. The actively managed ETF seeks to provide exposure to “Bitcoin Bonds,” defined in the filing as convertible securities issued by MicroStrategy or similar firms. Bonds Allow Holders to Convert Them into Company Shares These bonds allow holders to convert them into company shares under specific conditions, while the proceeds are used to buy Bitcoin. Strive also plans to include exposure to these bonds through financial derivatives, such as swaps and options. Although the fund’s management fee has not been disclosed, actively managed ETFs typically carry higher fees than passive index funds. MicroStrategy, a pioneer in corporate Bitcoin adoption, has invested approximately $27 billion in Bitcoin since 2020 under the leadership of its co-founder, Michael Saylor. The company has financed these purchases through a mix of equity offerings and convertible bonds. Its aggressive Bitcoin strategy has propelled its stock, MSTR, to gain over 2,200% in value, outperforming most large-cap public companies, including tech giants, with the exception of Nvidia. Following MicroStrategy’s lead, corporate treasuries collectively hold around $56 billion worth of Bitcoin, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net. Ramaswamy, a billionaire entrepreneur and ally of President-elect Donald Trump, launched Strive in 2022 with the goal of empowering investors through capitalism-driven strategies. Though he briefly campaigned against Trump in the 2023 Republican presidential primary, he later endorsed Trump and joined Elon Musk in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) , a private initiative aimed at reducing government waste. Industry experts anticipate that Trump’s presidency could accelerate the approval of several pending crypto ETFs, which include funds focusing on altcoins like Solana, XRP, and Litecoin. Trump’s pro-crypto stance is evident in his appointment of David Sacks, former COO of PayPal, as his “AI and crypto czar,” and Paul Atkins, a former commissioner, as his nominee for SEC chair. Bitwise Files for Bitcoin-Focused ETF Aside from Strive, Bitwise has also filed to launch the Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF, which will focus on publicly traded companies holding significant Bitcoin reserves. According to a recent regulatory filing , eligible companies must have at least 1,000 Bitcoin in their corporate treasuries, a market capitalization of at least $100 million, daily liquidity of $1 million or more, and a free float of under 10%.

Positioned as the most explosive crypto opportunity of the year, WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers investors a rare chance to capitalize on a New Year’s miracle of unprecedented proportions. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The 65,500% Rally That Could Define Your New Year WallitIQ (WLTQ) is quickly rising as one of the most thrilling tokens in the cryptocurrency landscape. While the Cardano price is expected to surpass $5 by March 2025, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is capturing global investor attention with a predicted jaw-dropping 65,500% surge by January. Experts attribute this explosive potential to WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) groundbreaking utilities, including an AI-powered, decentralized platform loaded with cutting-edge features like AI-enhanced portfolio management, a multimodal chatbot, and convenient QR-based Scan & Pay solutions. These innovations ease DeFi investments, positioning WallitIQ (WLTQ) as a market leader and a long-term asset for generating massive gains beyond January 2025.

With analysts forecasting a 65,500% surge by January and the possibility of extending gains to 75,000%, investors are looking at WallitIQ (WLTQ) as more than an opportunity but a revolution. . ADA’s $5 Breakthrough: Cardano Price Prediction For 2025 The Cardano price has been steadily gaining traction as one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies in the market. With a promising roadmap and robust technological advancements, analysts now predict the Cardano price could break the $5 milestone from $0.897 by March 2025, making it a key contender in the race for blockchain dominance. A major driver for this projected surge in the Cardano price is its revolutionary proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which offers unparalleled energy efficiency and scalability. As more developers flock to the Cardano (ADA) ecosystem, the demand for ADA, the native token, continues to rise. This growing adoption fuels optimism that the Cardano price will skyrocket in the coming years. In addition, Cardano’s (ADA) strategic partnerships and expanding utility further solidify its position as a market leader. From powering decentralized applications to facilitating secure smart contracts, the platform’s versatility is attracting investors. Experts believe these developments could catapult the Cardano price into uncharted territory. As the crypto market matures, regulatory clarity and institutional interest are also expected to play a pivotal role in ADA’s growth. With these favorable conditions, the Cardano price breaking $5 by March 2025 seems increasingly plausible. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale: The Future Of Crypto Growth Starts Here While the Cardano price climbs toward the $5 milestone, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is emerging as the true standout in the crypto world. Predictions point to an astonishing 65,500% surge by January 2025, positioning WallitIQ (WLTQ) as the most bullish asset on the market. Backed by a successful SolidProof smart contract audit , WallitIQ (WLTQ) is earning trust among investors, while its presale price of just $0.0243 offers an unbeatable opportunity for massive returns. Combining reliability with unparalleled growth potential, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has quickly become the go-to token for those aiming to achieve life-changing profits by 2025.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT.

Solana and Its Role In Blockchain Technology Solana is a blockchain platform designed for speed and scalability. It allows developers to build decentralized applications while competing with platforms like Ethereum. The system processes transactions quickly without relying on sharding or side chains. Solana’s native cryptocurrency, SOL, is used for transaction fees, program execution, and network rewards. Its architecture supports developers with tools across various programming languages. This versatility makes Solana suitable for hosting projects requiring high performance. The coin’s value is tied to its ecosystem’s growth and adoption. SOL appeals to those looking for efficient blockchain solutions. The focus on high capacity and developer-friendly tools positions Solana as an option for scalable innovations in blockchain technology. Avalanche: Efficient Blockchain with Customizable Subnet Functionality Avalanche is a fast, energy-efficient blockchain with low fees. It processes up to 4,500 transactions per second and finalizes them in under two seconds. Its structure includes three chains for specific tasks like transactions and smart contracts. Users can create custom Subnets tailored to specific needs. The network uses a hybrid consensus model combining classical and Nakamoto methods. AVAX, its native token, is used for fees, staking, and running Subnets. It can also support payment systems and the creation of custom blockchains. This combination of speed, functionality, and adaptability makes Avalanche and AVAX appealing in the evolving blockchain market. Conclusion While Solana and Avalanche may offer steady growth, they show less short-term potential. In contrast, DOGEN embodies luxury and success for those seeking the best. With expected 700% growth by the end of presale and potential for thousand-fold returns, DOGEN is poised to dominate this altcoin season, building a community of alpha leaders who settle for nothing less.

All attention is now drawn to 1Fuel (OFT) , the token behind the cross-chain cryptocurrency wallet in development to simplify transactions. Experts say that at presale stage 2, with over $800,000 raised so far, its current price of $0.012 is a bargain. Here’s a deeper look: ADA falls below $1 as investors back off Investors in ADA are backing out one after the other, as reflected in the weeks of decline. ADA dropped by 12% in the past week alone, placing it at $0.91 at press time with technical indicators hinting at further decrease. Investors are closing their positions on ADA as the only hope for a bounce back hinges on a descending channel, involving prices dropping lower (within a support and resistance line) before bouncing higher. Analysts say ADA could fall as low as $0.60 before any major upward momentum occurs. With ADA’s trading volume declining by 9.90% and its price dropping 1.61% in the last 24 hours, this suggests a market divergence with possible exhaustion in the buying, indicating an incoming decline. Investors, not wanting to be caught in this downside murkiness, are leaving ADA and seeking better alternatives. XRP has also been ruled out as a profitable asset to purchase. XRP investors might begin opting out After a month-long rally, XRP has now dropped. Over the past 7 days, it caused investors to lose 5.36%, falling as low as $1.9. However, XRP is currently trading within a consolidation channel known as an asymmetrical triangle. The price trading in this channel involves a slow and steady buying of the asset (in this case, XRP ) at a low price before a final upswing. However, this phase could last weeks or even months, leaving investors uncertain about when a meaningful rally will surface for XRP . Following the recent downturn and the lack of a definitive date for a rally, investors are turning to 1Fuel . With its presale price at $0.012, experts claim it is the cheapest cryptocurrency to buy in 2024 . 1Fuel: Investor’s yield generator, ahead of ADA and XRP 1Fuel has become the talk of the crypto community as its presale stage 2 has generated $800,000 in nearly two weeks, driven purely by market interest. Experts project that 1Fuel could deliver 100x returns by the end of its presale and upon the launch of its associated wallet. The wallet aims to solve critical pain points in the crypto ecosystem, including cross-chain transaction inefficiencies, unified gas fees, and streamlined off-ramp and on-ramp solutions. With a clear roadmap and strong market interest, 1Fuel is quickly gaining a reputation as one of the best crypto investments of 2024 . Conclusion As one of the best crypto investments of 2024 , with the potential to return 100X and backed by the anticipated cryptocurrency wallet , it is without doubt that experts are correct in predicting 1Fuel’s potential to outperform other crypto assets in the market, ADA and XRP inclusive.

38167959,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376271,1735273438,South Korea Takes Action Against North Korean Cyber Criminals,"South Korea has intensified efforts to curb the illegal cyber operations of its northern neighbor, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), which have escalated to alarming levels. These activities, which include cryptocurrency theft and IT-related foreign currency generation, are said to be funding Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs. Crypto Crimes Funding Military Developments In a press statement released on Boxing Day, the South Korean government announced it had designated 15 North Korean IT employees and one organization under independent sanctions. The individuals allegedly belong to the 313th General Bureau, an entity tied to the DPRK’s Ministry of Munitions Industry, which oversees the country’s weapons development programs. Among them, Kim-Cheol-Min is accused of working secretly for technology firms in the United States and Canada, funneling large sums of money to the North Korean regime. Another individual, Kim Ryu-Sung, previously faced indictment in the U.S. for violating sanctions. The measures will also target the Chosun Geumjeong Economic Information Technology Exchange Company, which is claimed to dispatch IT workers abroad to help generate foreign currency for North Korea. The money is reportedly used to finance military developments in the pariah nation. Once the sanctions come into effect on December 30, 2024, South Korean laws require that any financial transactions with the affected individuals and entities must receive approval from the Financial Services Commission or the Governor of the Bank of Korea. Growing North Korean Threat The restrictions against the alleged DPRK agents come even as a recent Chainalysis report revealed that North Korean actors were responsible for 61% of the $2.2 billion stolen in 2024 in crypto heists across the globe. The hackers used sophisticated tactics, including malware deployment and social engineering, allowing them to target major digital asset companies. In one instance, the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Radiant Capital suffered a $50 million hack attributed to the North Koreans. The attackers orchestrated the breach through malware distributed via Telegram, exploiting weaknesses in the platform’s security. Additionally, the notorious hacking outfit, the Lazarus Group, has been linked to another $50 million heist, this time on the Upbit crypto exchange. South Korean authorities, in collaboration with the FBI and Swiss prosecutors, confirmed the group’s involvement and shed light on its ties to the DPRK’s main intelligence agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau. Kaspersky Labs security analyst Vasily Berdnikov also connected the syndicate with an elaborate hacking plot that involved cloning a popular blockchain game and embedding malicious code within its website, allowing it to install malware on the systems of anyone playing the game. Meanwhile, U.S. authorities have been tackling related issues. On December 17, the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned two individuals and an entity for allegedly laundering millions of dollars in crypto for the Kim Jong Un administration.

Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa (KAS) is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that implements the GHOSTDAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchains that discard blocks created simultaneously, GHOSTDAG allows these blocks to coexist and orders them in consensus. This method transforms the blockchain into a block Directed Acyclic Graph (blockDAG). By generalizing Nakamoto consensus, Kaspa achieves secure operation with very high block rates. Currently, it produces one block per second, aiming to increase to 10 blocks per second and potentially 100 in the future. This results in minimal confirmation times, primarily limited by internet latency. Kaspa’s implementation includes features such as Reachability to query the blockDAG’s topology and block data pruning, with plans for block header pruning. It supports Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) proofs and will later include subnetwork support, which will facilitate future layer 2 solutions. The coin introduces innovations in blockchain technology and addresses scalability while maintaining security. In the current market cycle, Kaspa’s technological advancements may be noteworthy to those following developments in proof-of-work cryptocurrencies. Conclusion While KAS and DOT are strong, XYZVerse’s pioneering all-sport memecoin unites fans and aims for massive growth, making it a standout in the bull run.

38167153,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398565,1735271668,Bitwise Files for ETF Tracking Corporate Bitcoin Giants,"The post Bitwise Files for ETF Tracking Corporate Bitcoin Giants appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitwise has filed for an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) that focuses on companies holding massive amounts of Bitcoin. The idea? To offer investors a way to gain exposure to firms embracing the “Bitcoin standard.” Curious what that means? Let’s break it down. A Closer Look at Bitwise’s Plan The proposed fund, called the Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF , is no ordinary ETF. To qualify for inclusion, companies must hold at least 1,000 Bitcoin in their reserves. That’s not all. They also need a market capitalization of at least $100 million, daily liquidity of $1 million, and less than 10% of their stock privately held. Source : SEC Edgar Here’s where it gets interesting: the ETF doesn’t weigh companies based on their market size, like most funds do. Instead, it focuses on the value of their Bitcoin holdings. MicroStrategy, which holds a whopping 444,262 BTC, would dominate the ETF, even though Tesla owns far fewer Bitcoin (9,720 BTC) but has a much larger market cap. Each holding, however, is capped at 25% to keep things balanced. Bitcoin’s Growing Corporate Appeal Why are companies diving into Bitcoin? Partly because it’s great for their stock prices. Take KULR Technology Group , for instance. They bought 217.18 BTC for $21 million earlier this month. That decision paid off big time, boosting their stock price by 40%. And let’s not forget Bitcoin itself. The cryptocurrency has soared 117% this year, hitting a record high of $108,000 in December. Even now, it’s holding steady at around $95,800. It’s clear that Bitcoin’s appeal is only growing. What to Expect Bitwise’s ETF isn’t the only one vying for attention. Strive, a firm founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, has filed for an ETF focused on Bitcoin bonds. It’ll be interesting to see how these competing proposals play out. For investors looking to bet on Bitcoin’s rising adoption, these ETFs could open exciting new doors. But as always with crypto, there’s a mix of potential and uncertainty.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitwise-files-for-etf-tracking-corporate-bitcoin-giants/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
38178789,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322933,1735271031,"Tether Makes First VC Investment, Pouring $2M in Arcanum’s Web3 Fund","Tether, the issuer of the world’s leading stablecoin USDT, has made its first foray into venture capital by investing $2 million in Arcanum Capital’s Arcanum Emerging Technologies Fund II. The fund is a tokenized investment vehicle focused on supporting decentralized Web3 projects aimed at advancing blockchain-based technologies, including remittances, privacy, and financial inclusion. The fund aims to enhance cross-border payments, privacy, and banking services for the unbanked, according to a recent press release . Tether Dirversifies Business Ventures Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino noted the importance of fostering censorship-resistant systems and open communication, especially in the face of growing geopolitical and financial restrictions. “In a world increasingly shaped by geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty, the need for resilient technology to safeguard our freedoms has never been more crucial,” he said. The investment is part of Tether’s broader strategy to diversify its business ventures. TETHER INVESTS $2M IN ARCANUM CAPITAL’S WEB3 FUND Tether has made its first venture capital investment, allocating $2 million to Arcanum Capital’s Web3-focused Arcanum Emerging Technologies Fund II. The fund targets blockchain innovations in areas like cross-border payments,… pic.twitter.com/v75CpEv76x — Crypto Town Hall (@Crypto_TownHall) December 26, 2024 Recent moves by Tether include a $45 million crude oil transaction financed using USDT and a proposal for a boron-backed token to the Turkish government, reflecting its efforts to explore new opportunities in tokenized assets. Tether also introduced the Hadron tokenization platform, enabling businesses and governments to tokenize real-world assets such as securities and stocks. Furthermore, Tether recently invested $775 million in Rumble , a video-sharing platform known for its free speech ethos. Ardoino cited Rumble’s commitment to uncensored content as a key factor in the decision. Meanwhile, Rumble’s embrace of cryptocurrency extends beyond Tether’s investment. On November 25, the platform confirmed plans to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet, with its board approving up to $20 million of the company’s excess cash reserves for Bitcoin purchases. Cantor Fitzgerald Acquires 5% Stake in Tether Financial services giant Cantor Fitzgerald has acquired a 5% stake in Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin issuer, in a deal valued at up to $600 million. The acquisition, which occurred within the past year, positions the firm to potentially leverage political influence through its CEO Howard Lutnick, who was recently appointed as U.S. President-Elect Donald Trump’s Secretary of Commerce. Cantor Fitzgerald’s involvement with Tether could bolster the stablecoin issuer’s standing amid increasing regulatory scrutiny. Tether has faced ongoing investigations from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York regarding alleged use of its stablecoin, USDT, in illicit activities such as terrorism financing. Amid these challenges, Lutnick’s political clout may play a pivotal role in navigating regulatory hurdles. Tether’s largest shareholder, Giancarlo Devasini, reportedly expressed confidence in Lutnick’s ability to “defuse threats facing Tether,” according to sources cited in the WSJ. Lutnick, who has been working closely with Trump as a transition advisor, is vetting candidates for key government roles, some of which could directly impact oversight of Tether. He is expected to step down as Cantor Fitzgerald’s CEO upon Senate confirmation of his cabinet position.

Meanwhile, Ethereum traders recently made some impressive profits, and one trader earned $1.1M from a leveraged short. Analysts also predict that ETH could outperform Bitcoin in early 2025. Ethereum ETFs, like BlackRock’s ETHA, are already gaining momentum by attracting millions in inflows, contrasting with Bitcoin ETFs. Vitalik Buterin Adopts Viral Pygmy Hippo Moo Deng Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, captured the internet’s attention by adopting Moo Deng, a pygmy hippopotamus that became a viral sensation earlier this year. The announcement was made by Thailand’s Khao Kheow Open Zoo on Dec. 26 through a post on X which revealed that Buterin contributed 10,000,000 Thai Baht (or $292,000) to support Moo Deng and her family as part of the Wildlife Sponsorship Program. The zoo is extremely grateful that Buterin will be supporting Moo Deng over the next two years. Moo Deng rose to fame in September of 2024 thanks to her playful personality and the widely shared videos posted by the zoo, which captivated audiences worldwide. After the adoption announcement, Buterin indicated that his support could extend further, and revealed plans to allocate 88 ETH, which is equivalent to over $290,000, to assist Moo Deng and her companions. Buterin’s philanthropy in 2024 also included a $180,000 Ethereum donation to the biotech charity Kanro, which came from meme coins that were sent to his wallet. The viral phenomenon of Moo Deng extended beyond just the confines of social media, and even inspired the creation of a Solana-based meme coin named MOODENG . Early investors reaped impressive profits from the token, and one trader transformed a $1,300 investment into $3.4 million. However, the token’s success was short-lived as its value plummeted by about 58% from its peak price of $0.62 in mid-November 2024. Data from Solana’s meme coin launchpad, Pump.fun, revealed that more than 99% of traders suffered losses or gained less than $1,000. Out of 8.5 million wallets, only 50 earned up to $1,000, while five wallets achieved profits between $1,000 and $10,000. Just one wallet managed to exceed $10,000 in earnings. Despite the financial turbulence, Moo Deng is still a symbol of joy and community engagement, now with the added support of one of cryptocurrency’s most influential figures. Trader Nets $1.1M on Ether Short MOODENG was not the only token that traders lucked out on. A crypto trader recently made more than $1.1 million in profit in just two days by strategically shorting Ethereum (ETH) during the current market correction. By using a 50x leveraged short position, the trader borrowed 19,186 Ether, worth more than $64.5 million, when its price was $3,428. This position was opened on Dec. 24, and also earned the trader over $680,000 in funding fees. According to blockchain data from Hypurrscan , the short position carries a liquidation price above $4,750. On-chain intelligence firm Lookonchain revealed that the trader faced a $1.2 million loss on the first day. However, the market's subsequent downturn flipped the position into a highly profitable trade. While leveraged trading can amplify returns, it still carries some serious risks. These risks took center stage in January of 2024 during an incident where a trader lost over $161,000 after being liquidated on a leveraged position. The past year has seen other traders make extraordinary profits in the volatile crypto market. Bitcoin’s historic climb past $100,000 on Dec. 5 was especially a boon for many, while meme coin traders also saw good returns. One such trader turned a $27 investment into $52 million over 600 days by capitalizing on PEPE’s meteoric rise. Another trader in May achieved a $46 million profit from a $3,000 investment in PEPE. Ether Poised for Breakout Traders can make even more money off ETH as the altcoin is showing potential for a breakout against Bitcoin in January 2025. TradingView data revealed that the ETH/BTC ratio strands close to 0.0356, and MN Capital founder Michael van de Poppe suggested it could surpass 0.04 in January. The last time the ratio hit 0.04 was on Dec. 8, when ETH reached $4,018. Van de Poppe expects increased inflows into Ether in the coming month, while Bitcoin may experience outflows that could potentially consolidate its price. This shift could trigger an “altcoin run,” which happens when alternative tokens like Ethereum gain more market momentum. Already, key Ethereum ecosystem tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Mantle recorded impressive price increases recently. Bitcoin , meanwhile, continues to trade below the $100,000 mark. Despite reaching the six-figure milestone on Dec. 5, its current performance contrasts with the enthusiasm building around Ethereum and altcoins. Analysts also predict that spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could outperform Bitcoin ETFs in 2025. Nate Geraci , the president of ETF Store, shared that inflows into ETH ETFs are aligning with those of gold ETFs and may accelerate even more in the near future. Pseudonymous trader Brent compared Ether’s current state to a ”ball forcibly held underwater,” which means that the altcoin has the potential for explosive growth. Into The Cryptoverse founder Benjamin Cowen noticed earlier in December that the ETH/BTC ratio’s decline is either over or nearing its conclusion, which also sets the stage for potential growth over the next 6 to 12 months. Ethereum ETF Gains Momentum While Bitcoin ETFs Face Outflows BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF, the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), attracted almost $44 million in inflows on Christmas eve, bringing its total net assets to $3.65 billion, according to data from SoSoValue . In contrast, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) faced outflows of $188 million, contributing to an overall $338 million bleed from Bitcoin ETFs on the same day. Among the Bitcoin ETFs, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and ARK’s 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) recorded outflows of $83.16 million and $75 million, respectively. Bitwise’s Bitcoin ETF (BITB) stood out as the only product in the green, gaining $8.5 million in inflows. Bitwise’s Ethereum ETF also performed well after attracting roughly $6 million in inflows. Ethereum ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) Despite the recent underperformance, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF is still a standout success thanks to it amassing close to $54 billion in net assets in less than a year. This achievement cements its position as one of the most successful cryptocurrency stories of the year. Industry experts, including Bitwise, predict that the total Bitcoin ETF inflows next year could surpass those of 2024. Additionally, Bitcoin ETFs recently surpassed the estimated holdings of Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, though the exact number of coins owned by Nakamoto is still unknown.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6725/moo-deng-finds-a-benefactor-in-ethereum-co-founder-vitalik-buterin,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png
38178788,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322930,1735270143,Shiba Inu Price Stays Firm Following Bullish 200DMA Bounce – What’s Next for SHIB?,"The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price is stabilizing in the low-$0.000020s in wake of last week’s impressive bounce from its 200DMA around $0.000018s, a sign that will fill the SHIB bulls with optimism. Strong rebound after a test of the 200DMA are often a sign that the bulls are in control of the market and eager to buy dips to major support levels. After finding strong resistance at its 200DMA in July and September, the recent strong bounce from the 200DMA strengthens the argument that the Shiba Inu price has entered into a new bullish stage of its cycle. The rebound also means that the Shiba Inu price remains in an uptrend from its August lows under $0.000011. Of course, nothing is certain in crypto, especially in meme coin markets . A further price breakdown could soon ensue, with a drop to the low $0.000010s on the cards. However, chart analysis suggest the risk reward to buying SHIB at current levels is good. Combine that with the fact that a new meme season could be right around the corner and SHIB could be the best meme coin to buy right now . Here’s why. #SHIB 's comeback will be epic! pic.twitter.com/w2guEhBHE6 — SHIB POSSESSOR (@SHIBpossessor) December 26, 2024 Shiba Inu Price – How High Can It Go If Meme Season Returns?

But meme coins, the ultimate retail friendly speculative crypto assets, could be the best performing coins. Shiba Inu dog themed coins are also likely to do well thanks to the activities of Trump’s new Elon Musk -headed agency the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.). Department of Government Efficiency pic.twitter.com/HFeHYNIkJN — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 7, 2024 That will keep Dogecoin and its major competitors like SHIB in constant focus. Risks seem ver much tilted towards the resurgence of a new meme season, potentially more ferocious than ever seen before. So, if the Shiba Inu price is about the pump, how high might it go? Well, SHIB would almost certainly take out its 2024 highs at $0.000045. Beyond that, a retest of the 2021 record highs in the $0.000087 area, just over 4x higher than current levels, is certainly a possibility. But if the crypto market is experiencing serious mooning, the Shiba Inu price could blow these levels out of the water. Reaching a market cap above $100 billion (around 8x above current levels) would be very possible, in a scenario where Bitcoin (BTC) hit a market cap of $4 or more trillion. 8x gains would have most investors jumping for joy. But this is crypto, and many degens are hunting for the next 100x play. Shiba Inu certainly isnt that. But there are plenty of newer, smaller and lesser-known meme coin projects that could be the “next big thing”. One such project that has really caught the attention of analysts at cryptonews.com is a new meme coin called Meme Index (MEMEX) . Here’s what you need to know. Meme Index (MEMEX) – A Better Alternative to Shiba Inu? An innovative new meme coin project called Meme Index (MEMEX) is making waves in web3 circles, with its presale having already surpassed $500,000 in funds raised. The early interest is explained by Meme Index’s unique and high-potential value proposition – the team is building a dApp where crypto investors well be able to buy into and trade meme coin indices, as well as vote on what meme coin assets are included in each index. Meme Index is blending the meme coin and DeFi worlds to create a suite of exciting new investment products that are likely to attract a lot of attention as meme coin season returns, as they offer meme coin investors an easy way to diversify and manage their risk. Despite only launching a few weeks ago, the project is already gaining substantial traction, with dozens of respected crypto experts coming out to back the coin, including the likes of ClayBro , Jacob Crypto Bury and Austin Hilton . Interested readers should note that MEMEX presale investors are currently winning massive yields on their presale bags thanks to the project’s generous staking program designed to reward early investors and generate pre-token launch buzz. This is not a project to sleep on. Learn more about MEMEX by checking out its white paper here. MEMEX has passed major audits ( Consult and SOLIDProof ) and can be bought with ETH, USDT and bank card.

If you’ve been keeping your eyes peeled on the crypto scene, you know that meme coins have taken the market by storm, and this month, there’s one standout that’s going to make your wallet roar with excitement. Forget the usual suspects; we’re talking about BTFD Coin and its epic festive offer. With its community-driven approach, innovative gaming features, and legendary presale numbers (more than $4.5 million raised to this day), BTFD Coin is leading the charge. If you thought the price was already a steal, hold on tight—thanks to the BIG50 bonus code, you can unlock a jaw-dropping 50% bonus ! This isn’t just any sale. The bonus draws inspiration from the iconic 1973 market crash, a time when savvy investors seized the moment and rode the waves to success. So buckle up, because BTFD Coin is ready to rocket into 2025. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin to Watch for the Long Haul When it comes to the best new meme coins to invest in this month, BTFD Coin has earned its spot at the top. Not only is it packed with insane features like high-yield staking rewards, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that’ll keep you entertained for hours, and a strong, vibrant community, but it also offers an incredible opportunity for long-term growth. The festive 50% offer that you can unlock with the BIG50 code is the cherry on top. Let’s be real—who doesn’t love a good deal? Now, you might be wondering, “Why the 1973 market crash?” Well, it’s all about history repeating itself. Back in the ‘70s, the oil market crashed, and while many investors panicked, others saw an opportunity to buy in low and hold for the long term. Just like them, you’ve got the chance to grab BTFD Coin with a massive deal—before it potentially blows up and leaves everyone else in the dust. Let’s break it down with an investment example: If you put $6,000 into BTFD Coin at the current presale price of $0.00013, you’d initially receive 46,153,846 $BTFD tokens. But here’s the kicker—with the BIG50 bonus, you’ll snag an additional 50% tokens, bringing your total to 69,230,769 coins. If the price rises to $0.0006 (a target many analysts are predicting), that investment could skyrocket to $41,538.46. ANDY: The Pepe Sidekick Changes the Game If you’ve been around the crypto scene, you’ve probably heard of Pepe, the meme king of crypto. Now, meet ANDY, Pepe’s lifelong best friend, who has finally decided to launch his own meme coin and show the world what he’s made of. ANDY is all about fun, memes, and good vibes. And while it might not have the same explosive growth as some of the bigger coins out there, ANDY has a dedicated fanbase and a unique position in the market. With a circulating supply of 1 trillion ANDY coins, the token is all about community, making it an appealing option for anyone who’s looking to hop onto the Pepe train. Currently, the price of ANDY is sitting at $0.000196, with a 24-hour trading volume of $2.7 million. While the coin is currently down by about 14%, it’s still a solid contender in the meme coin race. If you’re looking for something a bit different, ANDY could be worth a closer look. DOGS: A Community-Driven Coin with a Woof Another contender in the meme coin world is DOGS, a coin that’s all about community ownership and fun vibes. Built on the TON blockchain, DOGS has already created a buzz by leveraging Telegram’s vast user base and incorporating meme culture into its core. If you’re part of the Telegram community, you’ve probably seen the iconic DOGS mascot popping up everywhere. However, like ANDY, DOGS has recently faced a bit of a dip, with the price down by around 7% in the last 24 hours. Despite this, the DOGS project is far from being counted out. It boasts a market cap of over $270 million and a dedicated following that keeps the coin’s spirit alive. With a circulating supply of over 500 billion coins, DOGS is another community-driven coin that’s worth keeping an eye on. How to Claim Your Bonus on BTFD Coin’s Presale Today If you’re ready to take advantage of this killer offer, here’s how you can claim your 50% bonus: Go to the Presale Page . Click “Connect Wallet” and select your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet). Locate the Bonus code field, enter BIG50 , and click “Apply”. Input the amount of $BTFD you want to buy and take a look at the updated amount. Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction in your wallet. Conclusion: The Best New Meme Coin to Invest in This Month Is Here The best new meme coins to invest in this month are here, but none shine quite as brightly as BTFD Coin. With its festive 50% offer, high-growth potential, and the excitement of its presale, BTFD Coin is the ultimate investment for anyone looking to start the new year off with a bang. Don’t wait too long—the chance to use the BIG50 code is a limited-time offer, as it ends after the 5th of January. Get in now, and let BTFD Coin be your ticket to a profitable 2025.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-cyborg-trumpcyb-solana-memecoin-will-explode-15000-before-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

As such, the newly launched cryptocurrency aims to “expand its community and further widen the reach” of the project by allowing old and new users “to align” themselves with the penguins. According to CoinGecko data, the Solana-based memecoin debuted with a 500% surge to a market capitalization of $3.5 billion but registered massive volatility in the following days. Just hours after launching, PENGU’s price retraced over 50% before descending to a $1.4 billion market cap on December 20. The token hovered between the $0.025-$0.037 range over a few days, stabilizing around the range’s upper zone on Christmas Eve. Whales Fill Their Bags As PENGU Flips BONK Amid the market’s momentary Christmas Day gains, the token broke above this range and climbed to the $0.042 mark on Thursday morning, hitting a $2.6 billion market cap. During this 18% rally, the token flipped dogwifhat (WIF) and BONK to become the largest Solana memecoin by market cap, currently holding its position as the sector’s leader. PENGU became the fourth largest memecoin by this metric, just behind Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE. Additionally, in the last 24 hours, the token has seen a 25% increase in market activity, with a daily trading volume of $1.92 billion. According to on-chain data analysis firm Lookonchain, Crypto whales have also noticed PENGU’s rally, with several large-scale investors filling their bags over the past week.

On December 24, a whale that had received an airdrop of 116.7 million PENGU, worth $3.52 million, increased its holding with a $1 million purchase. According to the post, the wallet spent 5,250 SOL to buy an additional 34.42 million PENGU, holding a total of 151.12 million PENGU, valued at $5.08 million. Similarly, another whale exchanged 500,000 ai16z, another trending Solana-based memecoin, today for PENGU. In the past eight days, this investor has spent $2.47 million to buy 79.9 million PENGU, having unrealized profits of around $835,000. As of this writing, PENGU is trading at $0.038, a 4.8% increase in the daily timeframe.

38178786,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322926,1735266368,"Cardano Price Could Dump 57%, But 2025 Could Be a Massive Year – Here’s How High ADA Might Go","The Cardano (ADA) price was under pressure on Boxing Day, declining over 6%, with technical analysis suggestive that further downside could be in store in the days ahead. ADA , last around $0.86, remains stuck in a downtrend from its early December highs above $1.30, and is back below its 50DMA once again. That suggests that the bears are in control of the market right now, with a retest of the key $0.80 support zone likely in the coming sessions. A break below here could be the trigger for a further decline back to the the next major support zone around $0.57. That would mark a more than 57% drop from its recent highs. However, while the charts are telling a story of peril and ADA investors should be prepared for a bumpy ride ahead, there are lots of reasons to be optimistic about the Cardano price outlook. That’s because the current market pullback, which has seen the Cardano price already pull around 35% lower versus its recent highs, is likely to be a temporary mid-bull market drawdown, not the start of a new bear market. Here’s why. Cardano Price Likely to Rebound in Early 2025 – Here’s Why Fundamental tailwinds to the Cardano price and broader crypto markets mean that price risks are very much skewed to the upside in 2025. The incoming pro-crypto Trump administration is set to land in the White House on the 20th of January, with a new pro-crypto, Republican controlled Congress set to start a few days earlier. Crypto investors are anticipating that 2025 will be the start of a new golden era for the crypto industry and markets in the USA, drastically accelerating global adoption. Trump may sign an executive order to kickstart a strategic Bitcoin reserve, his SEC picks will end the crusade against the crypto industry and start a new era of cooperation, and Congress is likely to pass bipartisan pro-crypto industry regulations. Whilst Bitcoin will be a massive beneficiary as the “global reserve asset” narrative gains traction, altcoins have just as much to gain amid a new, friendlier regime. ADA, accused in the past of being an “unregistered security” by the current SEC, could be just such a coin. But ADA has its own narratives that could stimulate explosive Cardano price action in 2025. Firstly, its founder Charles Hopkinson might end up being one of the crypto advisors to Trump, which would directly benefit the Cardano ecosystem. Moreover, Cardano is set to transform itself into a fully fledged Bitcoin layer-2 chain by May 2025, per Hoskinson. BREAKING Charles confirms: Bitcoin is coming to Cardano in May 2025. Are you bullish enough? $ADA pic.twitter.com/RQxV7zIzrT — Nala (@NALAp20) December 20, 2024 Given that Hoskinson expects a Bitcoin price in the $250,000-$500,000 in the next one to two years, that suggests Cardano could be setting up for explosive growth. Cardano Founder: It is my belief that #Bitcoin will go to $250,000 to $500,000 within 12 to 24 months.” pic.twitter.com/SQV7cCTYwX — Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDailyio) November 26, 2024 Up until now, Cardano has struggled to enjoy the same levels of real on-chain adoption as chains such as Ethereum, Solana and Sui. Its total value locked in smart contracts was last around $450 million, per DeFi Llama , leading to accusations of being a “ghost chain”. But should this trend change and on-chain adoption accelerate, that could help push the Cardano price to the moon. So, things are looking good for 2025, even if the short-term price action could be a little bumpy. However, for those with the ability to hold through short-term price bumps, 2025 promises to be a spectacular year for major altcoins like Cardano. A realistic target for this bull market would be the 1.618 Fibonacci extension of the 2023 lows traced back to the 2021 record highs just above $3.0, which is near $5.0. That could mean Cardano could still deliver gains of as much as 5x from current levels, despite already being up around 3x from its October levels. Of course, many bulls are predicting even bigger things for the Cardano price, but no one can really be sure how high the crypto will fly during the upcoming bull market. That means Cardano is a strong candidate for best crypto to buy right now . However, a concern is the lack of major adoption of the blockchain, despite having been around for many years and boasting a large and dedicated community. Rather than putting their eggs all in one basket, a better strategy in crypto is to diversify amongst different coins. Bitcoin , the most established crypto that continues to lead global adoption (national strategic reserves coming in 2025?), should probably be the cornerstone of any investor’s portfolio. Other major altcoins like Ethereum , Solana and XRP also warrant consideration. But ADA certainly has its place, and could be a major winner in the long run.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN.

38162187,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667320,1735261224,"Bitcoin Tokens Have Only Been Getting Older This Bull Run, Analyst Reveals","An analyst has explained how the age of the average Bitcoin token has only been getting older during the recent bull run, something that could be bullish for the asset’s price. Bitcoin Average Coin Age Has Been Trending Up Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has talked about the recent trend in the Average Coin Age for Bitcoin. The “Average Coin Age” is an on-chain metric that keeps track of how long the average BTC token has been staying dormant for. A coin is said to be dormant when it sits still inside an address without being involved in any sort of transaction activity. The longer the coin stays in this state, the more it ‘ages’ up. Related Reading: XRP Jumps 4%, Whale Reacts With $69 Million Coinbase Deposit Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the 30-day and 365-day moving averages (MAs) of the Bitcoin Average Coin Age over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the 30-day MA of the Bitcoin Average Coin Age has seen some sharp spikes this year, but also some equally steep declines. This would suggest that the investors have been participating in some phases of HODLing, but they have also not been shying away from taking some profits. On the whole, however, the holders have shown notable resolve, as the 365-day MA of the indicator has been in a constant state of uptrend since the end of the 2022 bear market. Statistically, the longer investors hold onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them at any point. As such, the fact that the investors have been increasingly preferring to keep their coins dormant can be a bullish sign for the cryptocurrency’s price. Interestingly, this trend didn’t develop during the 2021 bull market, as even though the 30-day MA of the Average Coin Age saw a period of uptrend, the 365-day MA moved down throughout the year instead. This could imply the average investor has become smarter this cycle. In the short-term, the 30-day MA of the indicator has been rapidly climbing, which implies the Bitcoin market is currently in one of the phases of active accumulation.

In some other news, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has shared an update on how the 5+ years old BTC supply is looking right now.

Following the latest jump, nearly a third of the asset’s tokens in circulation haven’t been involved in a transaction since more than five years ago.

38162184,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=314164,1735261211,"Crypto Bull Market Much Closer To End Than We Realize, Warns Analyst Jason Pizzino","A closely followed analyst says the crypto bull market’s end is much closer than most traders realize. In a new thread on the social media platform X, Jason Pizzino tells his 123,400 followers that investor sentiment indicates traders now are closer to the end of the bull market than the start. “Bitcoin and crypto ‘end-stage’ emotional volatility has dramatically increased which only suggests we are much closer to the end than the beginning of the cycle. That might seem like an obvious statement now, but wait until the market gets closer to the final top; it won’t be so obvious which is generally a signal within itself.” In an accompanying video update, Pizzino says historically, when the market gets excited and overconfident, stagnation tends to follow. “I think a lot of people believe this cycle should run until the end of 2025, but what if we’re seeing a lot of that excitement come back into the market? Every time it goes up, all I see is just everyone getting super bullish and then it pauses for a bit, corrects, and then we start on the next move. So I’m just keeping an open mind.” Source: Jason Pizzino/X The trader’s chart uses Bitcoin ( BTC ) as an example. According to Pizzino, the top crypto asset by market cap may correct or trade sideways all the way until October 2025. “Looking somewhere [between] Q2 out to Q3, just the beginning of Q4… Most people can’t handle six to 10 months. They talked about a drop of one month and they all freaked out yesterday, it’s absolutely bonkers out there, which is why I think we are in those final moves, basically the end of the cycle.” BTC is trading at $98,900 at time of writing, a marginal increase on the day.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT.

Table of Contents Trump ignites meme coin season — Catzilla set for takeoff Bitcoin Conclusion A trader famed for accurately forecasting Bitcoin’s price movements now suggests that a meme token, currently priced at $0.0007, could soar to $1 in 2025. This bold prediction has caught the attention of the crypto world, sparking curiosity about the potential of this overlooked token. Trump ignites meme coin season — Catzilla set for takeoff Donald Trump’s comeback has lit a fire under the crypto market, with meme coins roaring back into the limelight. While blue-chip tokens make incremental gains, Catzilla is ready to leap ahead, positioning itself as the apex predator in this new meme coin renaissance. Trump’s vision of a pro-crypto America sets the stage for unparalleled growth, creating the perfect storm for meme coins to thrive. Among them, Catzilla stands tall, ready to shatter expectations and claim the throne. This isn’t just another meme coin; it’s here to rewrite the playbook for decentralized finance. Starting at just $0.0002, Catzilla’s presale climbs to $0.0016 over 14 stages, offering early adopters significant growth opportunities. Stage 4 is live at $0.0006, with a 16.67% price increase looming. Catzilla doesn’t just offer investment opportunities; it empowers the community with its a unique referral system: 8% USDT on direct referral purchases. 2% USDT on second-tier referrals. 1% USDT on third-tier referrals. With BTC and other major coins seemingly losing momentum, Catzilla rises as the ultimate underdog poised for greatness. You might also like: 4 overlooked cryptos poised to turn $200 into half a million: Catzilla on spotlight Bitcoin Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency, using blockchain technology to enable decentralized peer-to-peer transactions without central authority. Its transactions are verified through mining, where miners solve complex puzzles to validate transactions and earn BTC as rewards. With a capped supply of 21 million BTC and halving events that reduce miners’ rewards every four years, Bitcoin is designed to be scarce. This scarcity, along with increasing adoption, gives it potential as a digital store of value. Conclusion With BTC and other major coins showing less short-term potential, Catzilla steps up as the ultimate meme coin hero, offering a 700% ROI during its presale. Its triple utility empowers holders through governance, rewards, and staking. Catzilla seeks to unite enthusiasts to fight for financial freedom, inviting participation in the battle against crypto villains.
