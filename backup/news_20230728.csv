15399346,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544897,1690585232,"Cardano (ADA) Price Remains Muted Despite Significant Milestones, Why?","Cardano (ADA) has been at the forefront of network development over the last few months. This continued commitment to further development on the blockchain has led to the network hitting multiple new milestones. However, the price of ADA has remained stagnant, so what’s going on? Latest Achievements For Cardano The year 2023 has been a good year for the Cardano network so far as it has celebrated multiple achievements during this time. The first of these is the fact that the Cardano network has recorded one of the longest uptimes of any blockchain in the space. Related Reading: Dogecoin Falls While Others Rally, Is It Decoupling From The Market? Cardano has recorded a continuous uptime record of 2,131 days as of July 28, which means that the network has not had an outage in almost six years. This achievement points to the sound technology behind the blockchain, in comparison to competitors such as Solana which has been characterized by multiple outages since its launch. Cardano has a current UPTIME of 2129 days exactly. That’s 5.83 YEARS with NO downtime. Built to last, an uptime the largest service providers in the world cannot & will never come close to challenging. Research Wins. We are Cardano. Choose Cardano. 🙌👏@IOHK_Charles @Cardano… — Dave 🧑‍🚀💽 🐋 (@beaumont_dvd) July 26, 2023 Another achievement for the network has the consistent development taking place. Cardano has consistently ranked among the top 3 ecosystems when it comes to development and this time around has been no different. ADA price trending at $0.31 | Source: ADAUSD on TradingView.com According to data from the on-chain tracker Santiment, the network is number 3 on the list of assets with the most developments over the last 30 days. This puts it behind only Polkadot (DOT) and Kusama Network (KSM), both of which emerged 1st and 2nd, respectively. This placement also puts Cardano ahead of its largest competitor Ethereum in terms of development. 🧑‍💻 Top 10 #crypto assets by development activity: notable #github commits, past 30 days: T1 @Polkadot $DOT T1 @kusamanetwork $KSM 3 @Cardano $ADA 4 @dfinity $ICP 5 @hedera $HBAR 6 @vegaprotocol $VEGA 7 @ethstatus $SNT 8 @cosmos $ATOM 9 @Ethereum $ETH 10 @decentraland $MANA pic.twitter.com/SnWDQf5a3y — Santiment (@santimentfeed) July 27, 2023 But Why Is ADA Not Reflecting The Achievements? Usually, when a network such as Cardano is recording such achievements as it has, it is reflected in the price of its native in the form of a rally. However, there has been no such performance from ADA. Rather, the altcoin has been shedding its gains since June. The problem may not be from ADA and might stem from the fact that the crypto market just reverted into another bear market trend. As a result, the broader market has been following the movement of Bitcoin, which on its own has reversed toward the low $29,000s. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pre-Halving Patterns Suggest Bull Market Is Not Starting In 2023 Given Cardano’s developments, if the market were to resume its rally, then ADA may emerge as one of the top performers. This would stem from the positive sentiment surrounding the token due to its significant achievements. Meanwhile, ADA is still performing well on a broader scale. At its current price, the digital asset’s price is up over 40% from its June lows, and ADA holding a good chunk of these gains shows that demand is rising to meet supply, thereby steadying the price.

The project recently announced its worldwide launch inviting users to “visit the orb” and receive rewards by onboarding the platform. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally May Not Resume Until This Happens WLD has doubled its value from its launch on July 24th, when the cryptocurrency was trading at around $1. The token rose to $2.19 the following week and has been moving sideways since amid a surge in controversy from different angles. Worldcoin (WLD) Leads Crypto Tendencies In addition to WLD, Coingecko shows that Bitcoin (BTC), Unibot (UNIBOT), Chainlink (LINK), HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, and Pepe Coin (PEPE) have been trending along with other tokens. Bitcoin remains the leader on this chart despite the crash in the BTC.D chart. This metric gauges the percentage of the crypto total market cap comprised solely of Bitcoin’s market capitalization. Often, when the chart trends to the upside, altcoins, such as Worldcoin (WLD) and PEPE, experience a drop in their prices and vice versa. In that sense, WLD’s launch came at a favorable time for small tokens. The project has promised a reward for every user willing to scan their eyeballs with one of the devices scattered around different countries. Thus, sparking controversy about their practices from the crypto community and regulators, some of which are already looking into the project’s legitimacy. Via his Twitter (X) account, Adam Cochran wondered if the hype around WLD is organic or fabricated by a marketing strategy. Cochran wrote: So either Worldcoin, or some group of Orb operators are legit paying plants to stand in line at orbs both for videos and to create demand for the orbs. Got pinged by an old marketing firm friend who does field event marketing, who was asking if Worldcoin is legit. PEPE Leads Trends In The United States While WLD took over the global attention in the nascent sector, PEPE Coin is still the king of the top trending tokens in 2023.

Prosecutors with the Department of Justice filed a written submission to a federal judge Friday, following up on their Wednesday statement that they were ""seeking detention"" for Bankman-Fried after he shared diaries from former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison with the New York Times.  Bankman-Fried's releasing of Ellison's writings qualifies as him trying to harass her to either prevent or otherwise influence her testimony in court, the DOJ filing said.  ""The defendant’s leaking of Ellison’s private writings is yet another instance of the defendant trying to intimidate and corruptly persuade Ellison with respect to her upcoming trial testimony, as well as an effort to influence or prevent the testimony of other potential trial witnesses by creating the specter that their most intimate business is at risk of being reported in the press,"" the filing said.  While Bankman-Fried has the right to defend himself in public, as his attorney Mark Cohen said he was trying to do in speaking with the Times, his sharing of the diary information goes beyond just making a fair comment, the DOJ said.  ""What the defendant may not do, and what he has now done repeatedly, is seek to corruptly influence witnesses and interfere with a fair trial through attempted public harassment and shaming,"" the filing said.  During a hearing on Wednesday, Judge Lewis Kaplan, of the District Court for the Southern District of New York, ordered the prosecution and defense to prepare formal documents on the DOJ's move to detain Bankman-Fried.

The company has lowered debt significantly but still loses roughly $26 million per quarter. At current Bitcoin prices, SDIG shareholders face continued risk of dilution. Stronghold Digital Mining ( SDIG ) has arguably the most unique approach to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining in the public equity market. What makes Stronghold particularly intriguing is that the primary focus of the operation is as an environmental reclamation company. Stronghold utilizes waste coal in Pennsylvania as part of a two-segment business model that includes Bitcoin mining and energy sales. Through an elaborate process that involves fluidizing waste coal, Stronghold turns coal that is both environmentally hazardous and uneconomical for steel or power generation otherwise into usable energy. Essentially, Stronghold is cleaning up the environment and producing energy as a biproduct of the cleanup effort. It then either uses that energy to mine Bitcoin or sell to the grid depending on unit economics of each segment at a given time. Data by YCharts At a sub-$100 million market capitalization, SDIG is a microcap and should be considered higher risk because of it. As one of the smallest Bitcoin miners in the public equity market, it's also one of the more volatile from a share price swing standpoint. Production and Capacity In Stronghold's June production update , the company disclosed 225 BTC mined in the month. This gave Stronghold a total Q2-23 figure of 626 BTC mined. That was up from 618 BTC in Q1-23 despite global hash rate growth of 23% over the prior quarter: Data by YCharts While small, Stronghold's quarter over quarter growth in BTC production was well ahead of many larger mining peers in the industry: BTC Mined Q1-23 Q2-23 Change Iris Energy ( IREN ) 501 1,255 150.5% Marathon Digital ( MARA ) 2,195 2,926 33.3% Cipher Mining ( CIFR ) 1,154 1,259 9.1% HIVE Blockchain ( HIVE ) 792 837 5.7% Stronghold Digital Mining 618 626 1.3% Bitfarms ( BITF ) 1,297 1,223 -5.7% Bit Digital ( BTBT ) 361 318 -12.0% CleanSpark ( CLSK ) 1,871 1,624 -13.2% Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) 2,110 1,775 -15.9% Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ) 475 399 -16.0% Source: Company releases At the end of May, Stronghold had 3.0 EH/s in operational mining capacity with plans to scale production to 4.0 EH/s by the end of the September. The company has been on a buying spree lately, having purchased 2,000 new miners from Canaan ( CAN ) for $3 million at the end of July after buying 5,000 MicroBT M50s in late April. Stronghold's waste reclamation facilities are Scrubgrass and Panther Creek. Scrubgrass has power generation of 85 MW and Panther Creek has 80 MW. StrongBox at Scrubgrass (The Allegheny Front) At these sites, the company utilizes mobile data centers which are referred to as a "" StrongBox "" to mine the Bitcoin. Revenue and Profitability From where I sit, it's difficult to take issue with the company's mission to clean up the environment. However, this doesn't necessarily mean Stronghold Digital Mining is actually a good investment. With $17.3 million in operating revenue, $15.9 million in cost of revenue, and an additional $15.9 million in opex, Stronghold had an operating loss of $14.5 million in the quarter ended March 31st 2023. Segment Performance (Stronghold Digital) With the exception of a $28.7 million loss from debt extinguishment shown above in other expenses, the biggest loss in the last quarter came from the company's energy operation. Energy sales have become a smaller portion of the company's total revenue over the last year: Q1-22 Revenue Q1-23 Revenue Q1-22 % Q1-23 % Cryptocurrency mining $18,204,193 $11,297,298 63.43% 65.43% Energy $8,362,801 $2,730,986 29.14% 15.82% Capacity $2,044,427 $859,510 7.12% 4.98% Cryptocurrency hosting $67,876 $2,325,996 0.24% 13.47% Other $20,762 $52,425 0.07% 0.30% Total operating revenues $28,700,059 $17,266,215 Source: Stronghold Digital Mining, 10-Q Year over year, crypto mining and hosting has gone from 63.7% of total revenue in Q1-22 to 78.9% in the last quarter. Despite the 67% decline in energy revenue year over year, fuel is still a large input cost for Stronghold because the company has to pay to truck the waste coal from the waste site to the power plants. After the waste coal is burned, the company then has to truck the ash back to the waste site to fertilize the reclaimed land. Operating Expense Q1-22 Q1-23 Fuel $9,338,394 7,414,014 Operations and maintenance $10,520,305 8,440,923 General and administrative $11,424,231 8,468,755 Impairments on digital currencies $2,506,172 71,477 Impairments on equipment deposits $12,228,742 — Depreciation and amortization $12,319,581 7,722,841 Total operating expenses $58,337,425 31,882,328 NET OPERATING LOSS (29,637,366) (14,616,113) Source: Stronghold Digital Mining, 10-Q As I see it, the big problem with the company's energy model is it is monetizing resources that aren't economically viable without tax credits and/or subsidized by Bitcoin mining. Data by YCharts Even with the aforementioned credits, Stronghold still lost about $26 million per quarter over the last year and seems entirely dependent on higher BTC prices to get to profitability. Balance Sheet From a balance sheet standpoint, the company has spent crypto winter deleveraging its operation and has reduced total liabilities by over $322 million in the last 5 quarters. As part of the company's debt restructuring, Stronghold had to amend obligations with 6 different counterparties. Slide 7, Q1-23 Investor Deck (Stronghold Digital Mining) Part of this debt restructuring included forfeiting 26,000 mining machines to a lender last August. Those machines represented approximately 2.5 EH/s in mining capacity. Current liabilities are down from $144 million at the end of Q2-22 to just $28 million at the end of Q1-23: Data by YCharts The company has very little cash at just $6.4 million as of quarter ended March. However, there are positive signs. Stronghold earned $11.3 million on 618 BTC mined in the last quarter. That equates to a Bitcoin sales price of roughly $18.3k. Bitcoin has oscillated between $28-31k for most of Q2. At what might be a conservative estimate of $27k per average BTC sold, Stronghold's revenue from crypto mining could be closer to $17 million for the upcoming quarter. All else being equal, that would result in Stronghold's net operating loss of $14.6 million moving closer to $8.5 million. Risks Of course, even at an author-forecasted operating loss estimate of just $8.5 million in Q2-23, Stronghold still wouldn't have had enough cash on the balance sheet to make it through the quarter without raising capital. In April, the company raised $10 million through a securities purchase agreement that included $1 million from Stronghold CEO Greg Beard and $9 million from an institutional investor. This was just 7 months after the company's last capital raise through share dilution in September of last year. Data by YCharts Adjusting for a 1 for 10 reverse split in May to remain compliant with Nasdaq listing requirements, SDIG shares outstanding have tripled in the last three quarters. Without much higher Bitcoin prices, Stronghold is highly likely to continue to lose money from the company's waste coal operation. Given the motive to restructure the company's previously high debt load, I believe shareholder dilution will be the continued strategy for raising capital. Investor Takeaways Philosophically, I don't dislike what Stronghold Digital Mining is trying to do. I think reclaiming land that is currently serving as a toxic waste coal dumping ground is an admirable endeavor. However, without dramatically higher Bitcoin prices or significantly more revenue from energy sales, Stronghold is likely going to be reliant on dilution to get by and that's going to ultimately be bad for shareholders. However, I'm not willing to call Stronghold a sell. Data by YCharts It is by far the cheapest publicly traded Bitcoin miner based on a 0.5 price to book multiple.

42392869,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCnPz,1690577234,Meta Aims to Recharge Lagging Horizon Worlds Metaverse With New In-House Game Studio,"Meta is revamping its Horizon Worlds metaverse platform with a new in-house VR game studio called Ouro Interactive.  The struggling platform reported losses of $3.7 billion in the second quarter of 2023; consumer interest in the metaverse appears to be cooling.  Meta is working to reboot its lagging Horizon Worlds platform through a new in-house VR game studio, in a bid to help the platform recoup major losses and revive waning interest in its metaverse among consumers.  In an interview with tech newsletter Lowpass, Meta’s metaverse VP Vishal Shah said that the company is producing new first-party titles through a new in-house studio called Ouro Interactive. The newsletter's author, who played one of their new games called ""Super Rumble,"" said that the studio is making use of new technological advancements to produce ""much better-looking and immersive experiences.""  ""We've really raised the ceiling on what can be built in Horizon in terms of visual complexity, interactivity and fun gameplay,” Meta’s metaverse VP Vishal Shah told Lowpass.  According to Shah, the platform is also hoping to better target the estimated billions of mobile gamers worldwide by bringing Horizon Worlds to app stores, though it's unclear when it plans to do that. By integrating cross-platform play, Shah told Lowpass that the mobile version is meant to act as a bridge for those who don't own a VR headset, shifting the platform further away from being ""VR only to a place where we're going to be VR first.""  Over the last year, Horizon Worlds has focused its efforts on supporting more complex games and the ability for developers to import assets from using third-party tools. It is also investing in generative AI tools to make it easier for users to build in its world without the knowledge of professional 3D rendering tools.  ""This is definitely more than just a new world,” Shah told Lowpass. “[It's] the next generation of Horizon Worlds.”  CEO Mark Zuckerberg affirmed Meta's commitment to AI and the metaverse in an earnings call on Wednesday, calling them both ""major priorities"" that are now ""overlapping an complementary.""  ""For Horizon, the team is focused on retention right now and we're making good progress on that,"" he said. ""We made big improvements on avatars as well and that's going to be a bridge between our mobile apps and our VR and mixed reality experiences.""  Still, the company clocked an operating loss in the second quarter of 2023 of $3.7 billion in its Reality Labs department, the business and research unit behind its Quest VR headsets and Horizon Worlds platform. In a press release, Meta said its expects Reality Labs operating losses to increase year-over-year in 2023 due to ongoing product development.  Meta's renewed interest comes at a time when other companies are scaling back their metaverse projects. In March, Disney reportedly laid off its metaverse team and shuttered its virtual world-building efforts.

A pending corporate reorganization and uplisting to the Nasdaq should be positive for shareholder value. The company is well-positioned to consolidate its position as a leading financial services provider within the digital assets space. Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. ( BRPHF ) is a leader in financial services specializing in connecting institutional clients with digital assets and blockchain technologies. The company is further diversified into infrastructure solutions which includes a growing Bitcoin mining operation. Following a turbulent 2022 defined by the sharp drop in crypto prices and high-profile sector bankruptcies, the setup this year has been the sector recovery led by the ongoing rally in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Shares of Galaxy Digital are up more than 70% year-to-date, repricing a more positive outlook with a renewed sense that the long-term tailwinds toward digital assets remain intact. Indeed, that was our thesis for the stock when we covered BRPHF last September, suggesting the company would "" emerge stronger following the crypto reset"". Our update today reiterates that bullish call highlighting the company's recent developments. In our view, catalysts to watch over the next several months make Galaxy Digital well-positioned to rally higher. Data by YCharts BRPHF Key Metrics Galaxy Digital is set to report its Q2 results on August 8th. The expectation here is for a continuation of trends in Q1 when the company reported an adjusted net income of $134 million , reversing a net loss of $288 million in the previous Q4, consistent with rebounding crypto prices over the period. The key here is to recognize that Galaxy consolidates three operating units within its corporate structure and financial results. All are benefiting from the relative risk-on environment with a building consensus that the worst of the 2022 volatility has passed. Source: Company IR ""Galaxy Global Markets"" is the largest segment, contributing to the bulk of total revenue and income, consisting of trading, market-making, and investment banking activities. The rally in digital assets in Q1 supported higher trading volumes and new loan originations, but more importantly, helped add to the value of portfolio holdings through unrealized gains. Similarly, the environment has been positive for the ""Galaxy Asset Management"" segment covering investment strategies between passively managed funds, active mandates, as well as venture capital allocations. Assets under management at $2.4 billion, climbed by 40% from the level in the preceding Q4, based on a return of inflows and the appreciation of portfolio investments. Source: Company IR We can also bring up the ""Digital Infrastructure Solutions"" group which Galaxy acquired through its purchase of the "" Helios Bitcoin Mining Facility "" From Argo Blockchain PLC ( ARBKF ) last December. The energy-efficient data center in Dickens County, Texas utilizes immersion cooling with room for expansion. The company is reporting 3.0 EH/s of hosted hast rate capacity, with approximately 30% of that being proprietary mining, and the remainder operated for clients. In Q1, this segment contributed to $10.2 million in income with management targeting an increase in hash rate capacity to 4.0 EH/s by year-end. For context, 4.0 EH/s is relatively modest compared to Bitcoin mining category leaders like Marathon Digital Inc ( MARA ) reporting 17.7 EH/s in operational hash rate but highlights the appeal of Galaxy Digital being its diversified business model. Galaxy Digital notes that it ended the last quarter with a liquidity position of $814 million which includes a balance sheet cash position of $400 million and $414 million of net digital assets. During the last earnings conference call , CEO Mike Novogratz noted that the ""banking crisis"" has added to the allure of digital assets as an alternative to the traditional banking system. While not offering forward guidance, the management team has projected optimism noting good trading and an expectation the company can continue to fund growth internally through the balance sheet and underlying profitability. Bullish Exposure to Crypto In our view, the attraction of BRPHF is that the stock offers diversified equity to the high-level themes driving digital assets, blockchain technologies, and the broader crypto sector. Naturally, any long-term bullish case will necessitate continued growth of the market, a favorable regulatory environment, and ultimately higher crypto prices. On this point, the idea here is that even with digital assets making headlines over the past decade, the upside considers that growth remains in the early stages. Galaxy shares data that the combined market cap of ""crypto"" across the combined value of all existing cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin and alternative tokens at $1.2 Trillion is still less than one-tenth of the market cap of Gold from exchange-traded products and tracked physical holdings globally at $13.2 Trillion, and even the total market capitalization of all publicly traded U.S. Technology and Financial firms at $13.6 Trillion. Source: Company IR In other words, the potential that crypto simply captures some market share represents a powerful tailwind over the next decade. Favorably, adoption is seen as accelerating with a greater understanding of crypto as a store of value and an alternative monetary system based on the benefits of decentralization. For Galaxy Digital, the opportunity is to assist both institutional investors and other service providers through its best-in-class platform and sector expertise. The case we make is that following the collapse of the crypto exchange ""FTX"" and smaller players in 2022 has opened the door for Galaxy to consolidate its market positioning. Source: Company IR What's Next For Galaxy Digital? One of the most positive developments for Galaxy Digital and the broader crypto sector could be the pending approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. Outside of various attempts from fund sponsors in recent years, indications are that the SEC may be willing to push forward applications from major sponsors like BlackRock ( BLK ), Fidelity Investments, and Invesco ( IVZ ). The reason this is important is that it would further reinforce the legitimacy of Bitcoin in a more regulated context, supporting further investor inflows and trading activity for Galaxy Digital in particular. Separately, Galaxy is moving forward towards a proposed reorganization of its corporate structure into a Delaware-incorporated company and uplisting on the Nasdaq. Pending an SEC review, we believe an announcement of a potential IPO allowing BRPHF to move out of its ""pink sheets' profile could help liquidity in the stock trading and add to shareholder value. Investors can also look forward to further share repurchases including an existing 10 million ordinary shares buyback program representing 10% of the public float. Source: Company IR Final Thoughts There's a lot to like about Galaxy Digital. The upcoming Q2 earnings report offers a good chance for the company to confirm it has maintained operating momentum and is translating the stronger crypto environment into firming financials. With that, we are bullish and see shares trading higher going forward. Ultimately, we expect the stock to outperform crypto benchmarks including the price of Bitcoin to the upside. That being said, the big risk here is that sentiment towards the crypto sector reverses which would likely translate into renewed volatility. Similarly, any setback to the regulatory environment in the U.S. including failure of a Bitcoin ETF or even the Nasdaq listing for shares of Galaxy Digital would open the door for a major repricing of the stock lower.

XRP Ledger Layer 2 Platform Audit Scheduled For Mid-August Evernode is a Layer 2 platform that seeks to bring smart contracts to the XRP Ledger ecosystem via Hooks. The platform is being developed by a team of experienced developers working to enhance the XRP Ledger network with advanced functionalities. Related Reading: Data Shows: Bitcoin Traders Going Long, Blast Above $30,000 Looming? In the first update, Evernode announced that the audit of their three hooks is tentatively scheduled to begin in mid-August. However, the team is still waiting for paperwork and funding from Ripple to confirm the audit, just like other XRPL Grants Grantees. In the second update, the Evernode team shared that the Nomad contract proved more challenging than expected. The contract did not persist on the betanet, which helped the development team identify bugs and areas for improvement. The team has been working hard to resolve these issues and remains optimistic that they will overcome the obstacles soon. Ultimately, Evernode appreciated the approximately 104 betahosts who have provided invaluable feedback in testing and improving the platform in a near-live environment. These updates highlight the complexity of developing a Layer 2 platform for XRP Ledger and the importance of thorough testing and auditing. It also emphasizes the dedication and hard work of the Evernode team throughout the development process. However, upon successful launch, Evernode’s platform will enable developers to build and deploy smart contracts on the XRP Ledger network, opening up new use cases and applications for the ecosystem. This will enable XRP Ledger to compete with other smart contract platforms such as Ethereum, which has gained significant traction in decentralized finance (DeFi). Moreover, Evernode’s platform will help drive the adoption of XRP Ledger by attracting more developers to the ecosystem. As the number of developers grows, the network’s capabilities will expand, leading to more use cases and applications, ultimately driving adoption and value. The development of Evernode’s Layer 2 platform for XRP Ledger is a significant milestone for the XRP Ledger community. It showcases the continued innovation and development within the ecosystem, which are critical for its growth and success. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally May Not Resume Until This Happens Overall, Evernode’s updates on the progress toward launching a Layer 2 platform for XRP Ledger demonstrate the importance of rigorous testing and auditing in developing complex systems. The successful launch of the platform will open up new opportunities for developers, potentially driving adoption and growth in the XRP Ledger ecosystem. At the time of writing, XRP has encountered a sideways price movement since Monday.

On Tuesday, July 25, Bright Moments’ artist-in-residence, Jimena Buena Vida, showcased pieces of her Ethereum project called “Epiphanies” in the form of generative art experience at Gotham. The attendees had the opportunity to both claim NFTs and purchase some of the store’s high-end goods. Gotham’s Chief Creative Officer Billy Richards commented on the collaboration, “We align with the idea of bringing different experiences, art forms, and people together. Both our teams are constantly on the forefront of new ideas and ways to engage our consumers.” What Do Crypto and Cannabis Have in Common? Unfortunately, the Bright Moments exhibit in New York drew only less than a dozen guests. One of the attendees, Omkar Lewis, suggested that people now have less interest in purchasing NFTs due to high interest rates. Besides, he also mentioned that NFTs are highly criticized and not socially acceptable yet, just like cannabis was some years ago. Lewis then drew comparison between the two: “They're both on the edge of something that wasn't culturally accepted,” he said. “NFTs are not quite socially acceptable yet, but in 20 years they will be.” This was the second time Bright Moments held their physical art minting event at Gotham. An artist and software engineer called Ngozi also presented their 'Dream Logic' NFT collection at the NYC dispensary last month. Companies in California and Canada have already attempted to use the blockchain technology to track growth of the medicinal plants. Some artists have also created cannabis-themed NFT collections. One of the latest examples is Crypto Cannabis Club. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Both are dropping by double digits in a matter of days. However, Tradecurve (TCRV) is one of the few coins bucking the trend. They are also setting new highs during a presale event. Let's jump into why these three coins are behaving so differently in the market. >>Register For The Tradecurve Presale Tradecurve (TCRV): Surging to New Highs Amidst Market Turmoil Tradecurve (TCRV) is a groundbreaking trading platform that successfully combines the best features of both centralized and decentralized exchanges. Here, users can conveniently trade an array of assets — such as cryptocurrencies, stocks, forex, and commodities — all within a single account. Commencing trading on Tradecurve is simple: create an account using an email address, select a cryptocurrency for a deposit, and then leverage your crypto balance to trade across the various asset classes. There are ZERO KYC or AML requirements, giving you complete privacy and anonymity when trading. TCRV is the proprietary token of the Tradecurve platform. Owners of this cryptocurrency gain access to multiple benefits, including reduced fees, earning passive income through liquidity provision, and discounted fees on AI tools. Presently, TCRV can be bought at a discounted price of $0.025 during the fourth stage of the platform's presale. Analysts recognize that Tradecurve brings an innovative product to a trillion-dollar industry, and it's no surprise that investors are rushing to get their hands on TCRV before the presale ends. Litecoin (LTC): Analyzing the Factors Behind its Recent Dumping Litecoin (LTC), launched in 2011, is one of the earliest and most recognized cryptocurrencies, often referred to as the ""light"" version of Bitcoin. It has a proven track record, with its value exceeding $400 twice, in 2017 and 2021. Litecoin has had a strong Q2 2023, with prices recently pumping from $69 to over $114 in just two weeks. This Litecoin price surge was triggered by the upcoming halving event that traditionally causes a surge in demand and higher prices. However, despite its excellent performance over Q2 2023, Litecoin has recently experienced some selling pressure and fallen back below the $100 support/resistance zone. Litecoin traders were perplexed by this as it was not in line with previous trends. It seems that the market impact of Litecoin has not been as strongly felt around the world. It was not felt as it had been in previous years. Analysts are commentating that the bullish narrative around this event is now over. Also, Litecoin holders may be looking to move their funds into alternatives. This is with the Litecoin halving less than one month away, Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Understanding the Reasons for its Price Decline Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is another popular cryptocurrency and was created as a hard fork of Bitcoin in 2017. It has had some impressive performance over Q2 2023, recently pumping by over 200% from $104 to $328 in just 10 days. This Bitcoin Cash pump seemed to come from nowhere. This is as Bitcoin Cash has been moving within a tight range since early 2022. Analysts note that Bitcoin Cash broke out of Descending Triangle pattern. This happened on the daily chart and this created a strong buying signal. But the real bullish trigger for Bitcoin Cash was the listing of Bitcoin Cash EDX Markets — a new crypto exchange backed by Wall Street. However, Bitcoin Cash has recently fallen back below its $300 support/resistance zone and is currently trading at just $273. Traders are still cautious about holding Bitcoin Cash in the long term given its volatile history. So it is likely that some holders are taking their profits and shifting to more reliable options, like Tradecurve.

42392902,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCyfX,1690571443,"No, Sam Bankman-Fried Is Not Being Bailed Out by Democrats","Yesterday, July 27, 2023, we received an object lesson in the dangers of disinformation. News of changes to the criminal charges against disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried began spreading like wildfire on social media. But these changes were misrepresented by influential figures – in some cases with the obvious goal of feeding a conspiratorial and partisan narrative.  That narrative, which has been spreading since FTX’s collapse, holds that Sam Bankman-Fried is a puppet for the Biden administration, and that he’s “getting away with it” thanks to friends in high places.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  To be crystal clear, Bankman-Fried is absolutely not going to get away with it. Not only does he still face a laundry list of active charges scheduled to be tried in October, prosecutors will likely continue to pursue the campaign finance charges. Similar procedural issues led to the dropping of another set of charges, including bank fraud, in June, but those charges were quickly revived as part of a separate trial scheduled for March 2024. It is expected prosecutors will request a similar rescheduling of the campaign finance charges in March.  See also: Sam Bankman-Fried Maybe Hasn’t Escaped Campaign Finance Charges  But these easily Googleable facts didn’t stop political influencers including right-wing blogger Ian Miles Cheong and co-founding editor of The Intercept Glen Greenwald from turning a flawed premise into political red meat. Republican residential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy followed swiftly after, castigating the ""corrupt"" Department of Justice (DOJ) for supposedly going easy on a major Democratic donor.  These pundits and others like them leveraged their mischaracterization of events to advance the FTX-Democrat connection. That politicized framing has been building on the political right since soon after FTX’s collapse – and in fairness, there are many signs of deep, systemic corruption in U.S. politics that suggest something well beyond one young man’s unhinged shell game.  But many of the basic assumptions tying Sam Bankman-Fried to the Democratic party are simply wrong – including the idea that he was a partisan Democratic donor at all. And in using false premises to boil that complex reality down to a partisan rivalry, conspiracy theorists are actually helping the corrupt elites they pretend to be attacking.  What really happened  The most important thing to understand is that the campaign finance charges against Sam Bankman-Fried are unlikely to go away.  As CoinDesk reported, they were dropped from the omnibus trial scheduled for this coming October. But if prosecutors instead attach the campaign finance charges to the March trial, that would likely mean more jeopardy for Bankman-Fried, not less.  Two separate trials would mean two separate juries. The second jury would be able to focus more on the campaign finance and bank fraud charges, leaving most of the complexity of Bankman-Fried’s embezzlement and financial fraud for the A-team.  Given the high likelihood of his conviction in the first trial, and the influence that would almost inevitably have on jurors in the second trial, yesterday’s reshuffling could make it *more* likely that he goes down for the campaign finance stuff, not less. A second, separate trial, moreover, makes it less likely that portions of his sentence could be served concurrently, potentially increasing his total jail time.  But you wouldn’t know any of this if you listened to figures like Ian Miles Cheong. Cheong’s comment on yesterday’s events is a sterling example of the blurry line between deception and incompetence, with his tweet seeming to imply that Bankman-Fried had been cleared of all charges, not just the campaign finance issue.  Replies to the post make clear that his followers believe Bankman-Fried has simply walked away scot-free – and that his Democratic donations were the key to this (nonexistent) get out of jail free card.  The cutout  This idea that “the Democrats did it” is, ironically, rooted in believing Sam Bankman-Fried’s own lies.  Before his downfall, the master swindler burnished his image in the media by pretending to be driven by a desire to save the world (in fact, he wanted to buy a private island for his friends). One pillar of this carefully-crafted image was his declaration that he would give $1 billion dollars to Democratic politicians in the 2024 election cycle.  This was a lie in (I’ve counted carefully) at least four ways.  First, Sam Bankman-Fried never had a billion dollars to give, or any real chance of getting there. Second, even before his fraud was revealed, he walked back the $1 billion number, which he seems to have made up because it sounded good. Third, Bankman-Fried later admitted that his entire commitment to the (already corrupt and broken) ideology of “Effective Altruism” was itself a strategic lie.  But the lie that really counts here (the fourth one) is that Sam Bankman-Fried was committed to Democratic party politics. In fact, he was donating stolen customer funds to both Republicans and Democrats. His real goal was never to get Joe Biden re-elected, but to curry favor with politicians on both sides in pursuit of favorable regulation.  The entire idea that Bankman-Fried was a ""Democratic megadonor,"" in other words, came about because he wanted to hide his donations to conservatives, and did so illegally. The goal was to maintain his public image as a nice (neo)liberal guy, so he routed those donations through others, including FTX staffers, who falsely claimed to be donors.  See also: The Faulty Moral Universe of Sam Bankman-Fried | Opinion  And here lies the real harm of the partisan and fact-averse interpretation of the FTX scandal as a Democratic Party operation: it obscures the fact that to the rich and powerful, America’s political parties are nothing but strategic playthings.  People like Sam Bankman-Fried and his coterie are dangerous not because of their political commitments, but because of their complete lack of real values beyond pursuing their own benefit. The very fact that Bankman-Fried was consciously working both sides of the aisle shows why it’s so misguided and dangerous to turn his prosecution into a political football.",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT,David Z.

42392884,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCxl7,1690570949,Sam Bankman-Fried Maybe Hasn’t Escaped Campaign Finance Charges,"Sam Bankman-Fried won’t face a campaign finance charge when he goes to trial in October, but that doesn’t mean he’s out of the woods.  The FTX founder will face seven charges in October, and another five during a second trial next year.  Prosecutors just withdrew a campaign finance charge ahead of Sam Bankman-Fried’s criminal trial this October.  That doesn’t mean the U.S. Department of Justice is letting the FTX founder off on alleged criminal conduct, however – and campaign finance charges could still be tried later.  Bankman-Fried is currently set to go on trial on Oct. 2 on seven different charges, including conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. He is then set to go on trial again in March of next year on another five charges, including conspiracy to commit bank fraud, conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitter and conspiracy to bribe foreign government officials.  The DOJ said in a letter Wednesday night that it was withdrawing the charge due to extradition treaty obligations with the Bahamas, sparking speculation that he was being protected by political backers.  The reality is much more boring.  Some background: Police in the Bahamas arrested Bankman-Fried in December in response to an extradition request from the U.S. government. Under the terms of the extradition treaty, Bankman-Fried had the ability to fight extradition, which he did initially before later agreeing to extradition.  At the time he was extradited, Bankman-Fried faced only the eight initial charges prosecutors brought in December 2022. The DOJ added another five charges through two superseding indictments over the next few months.  However, Bankman-Fried’s defense team argued in court that the Bahamas had to agree to those additional charges under the terms of its extradition treaty. The DOJ said it was willing to wait for that approval, and while the Bahamas government seemed willing to grant that OK, a Supreme Court judge ruled that Bankman-Fried had the right to contest it first.  As a result, the DOJ said it was willing to sever, or treat separately, the five additional charges, leading to the March trial date.  During a hearing last month, the defense team argued that the warrant of surrender did not include the campaign finance charge. The prosecution said that the charge was included in the extradition request.  In its letter Wednesday, the DOJ said that the government of the Bahamas had informed the U.S. government that it had not included the campaign finance charge in its arrest warrant and extradition document, suggesting that this charge also needed an OK from the Bahamas government.  The DOJ has not said whether it will push to add this charge to the March trial date. A spokesperson for the DOJ did not respond to a request for comment, though an interim gag order signed by District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is overseeing the case, may prevent the DOJ from commenting one way or another outside the court docket.  In the meantime, the prosecutors on the case face a deadline to draft and file a formal motion to remand Bankman-Fried into custody, after Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon alleged he had willfully tried to tamper with witness testimony after sharing former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison’s private diary with The New York Times. She told the court that the DOJ had concluded that his release conditions “placed too much trust” on him, and he had abused his privileges.  The DOJ filing is due by Friday night, and Bankman-Fried’s defense team has until Tuesday to respond.",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | RESEARCH,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/28/sam-bankman-fried-maybe-hasnt-escaped-campaign-finance-charges,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c356d26e20e9407badc86a892007c20d246892ae-4155x2338.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
15393677,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544886,1690570856,Stanford MBA Explains Why Next Bitcoin Cycle Could Be “Bigger”,"A Stanford MBA has explained why the current Bitcoin cycle was different from the others, and why the next one could end up being bigger. This Bitcoin Cycle Faced Obstacles That May Not Be There Next Time A “cycle” for Bitcoin refers to the period between two consecutive halvings. The halvings, events where the rewards miners receive for solving blocks on the network are permanently slashed in half, are chosen as the start and end points for the cycles due to the immense significance they hold for the cryptocurrency. The rewards miners earn are essentially the only way new supply can be introduced into circulation, so since halvings cut these in half, the production rate of the asset itself gets tightened. Because of basic supply-demand dynamics, Bitcoin’s post-halving scarcity increases the asset’s valuation. It’s not a coincidence that the bull markets have always followed these special events. The halvings occur roughly every four years, with the next one being scheduled for next year. As BTC transitions towards a new cycle, Jesse Myers, a Stanford MBA, has released a new post that looks back at this cycle so far and compares it with the previous cycles. At first sight, one difference becomes immediately clear: the structure of the top during this past bull market wasn’t anything like what the previous cycles displayed. How the previous halving cycles looked like at the current stage | Source: Once-In-A-Species “Instead of a parabolic advance culminating in a blow-off top, we got a bi-modal rounded top spread out over six months,” notes Myers. So, why did the BTC price behave differently during this bull market? Well, there are mainly four factors at play here. The first and undoubtedly the biggest one would be COVID-19 and the US government’s response to it. The onset of the virus and the black swan crash that came with it just preceded the cycle, meaning that the cycle kicked off in anomalous conditions. During the cycle itself, the Fed was giving out stimulus checks as a way to mitigate the economic impacts of COVID. “That Quantitative Easing (QE) undoubtedly helped fuel the 2021 Bitcoin bull market,” explains the Stanford MBA. The problem came, however, when the Fed changed its policy and switched to Quantitative Tightening (QT). Interestingly, this switch appears to be what marked the Bitcoin top in November 2021. In the middle of all this, another factor was also at play: the May 2021 China ban on Bitcoin mining. Back then, China was the biggest hub of cryptocurrency mining, so the ban naturally delivered a significant shock to the sector. The resulting selling pressure crashed the market, leading to the bull rally prematurely halting. It wasn’t until three months later that bullish winds once again returned for the asset. While these factors have been quite influential for BTC, it’s apparent that they are unlikely to repeat, meaning they shouldn’t have any presence in the next cycle. On the contrary, the other two factors that made this cycle different are likely to appear in the next cycle as well. This previous bull market was the first one where investors widely used leveraged futures trading. Probably, leverage would again come into play in the next bull market. Related Reading: PEPE Whales Load Up Their Bags As Memecoin Jumps 13% Lastly, there is the fact that platforms like FTX issue a lot of “paper Bitcoin.” Supply equivalent to 25% of the mined BTC that year was owned by FTX’s customers, but this BTC didn’t exist; it was only there on “paper.” The analyst believes that such fudging will likely be present during the upcoming cycle. While there had been some developments in this cycle that ultimately shortened the bull market, some changes can be favorable for the next cycle. The Bitcoin supply is quickly moving off exchanges, and the HODLers getting hold of the majority of the supply has often been making the news recently. Still, there is another super exciting factor. Accumulation from the small investors | Source: Once-In-A-Species According to this chart from Glassnode, the relatively small entities on the network (holding less than 100 BTC) have been accumulating 275% of all Bitcoin being mined. The fact that this rate is more than 100% suggests that the smaller investors are taking coins off the likes of whales. “This has never happened before. We have reached some kind of inflection point,” says Mjers. Soon the halving will occur, and this supply shock brewing in the market will only get tighter. Perhaps the smaller investors are looking to get in before this happens. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally May Not Resume Until This Happens Mjers mentions, however, that these individuals aren’t the only ones catching on; asset managers like Blackrock are also coming around and pushing to get themselves into the industry. As mentioned before, the QT policy proved disastrous for BTC in this cycle, but a shift back towards QE may be imminent, which would naturally boost the market instead. The analyst thinks this event might coincide with the upcoming halving of the cryptocurrency. Now, based on all these factors, these are probabilities that Mjers has assigned to the different price range predictions for the next cycle: The likeliness of each price range | Source: Once-In-A-Species The Stanford MBA believes that a growth of more than 8x, a multiplier higher than what the current cycle saw, is the second most probable scenario, given all the potentially positive developments. A cycle outperforming the previous has never happened in the cryptocurrency’s history, so if this scenario happens, it would be a first.

42392893,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCyFt,1690568770,Aliens Exist. And They Use Cryptocurrency,"Aliens exist. And they use cryptocurrency.  This isn’t exactly a provable statement, but for all we know Bitcoin could have been a gift from extraterrestrials. Can anything else explain Satoshi Nakamoto’s disappearance?  According to recent testimony from former Department of Defense employee turned whistleblower David Grusch, parts of the U.S. government have been engaged in an almost century-long conspiracy to cover up information regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) in the nation’s airspace.  The allegation was made during a House Oversight Subcommittee on National Security hearing Wednesday, and supported by claims made from executive director of Americans for Safe Aerospace Ryan Graves and retired Navy Commander David Fravor. In 2004 Fravor, then a pilot on routine mission, shot the now widely circulated footage of a “Tic Tac” shaped object capable of aerial maneuvers far beyond the technical limitations of modern aircraft.  Now, dear CoinDesk reader, you may be wondering what UFOs or talk of non-human “biologics” and physics-defying tech have to do with crypto. In short, it doesn’t. I’m sorta banking on the crypto community’s inclination to speculate to hold this piece together and your attention. But, I mean, isn’t any example showing that authorities cannot be trusted another notch for blockchain, a reason to build tools that empower individuals?  Anyway, aliens exist. And they use crypto. There are earthlings among us who are actually thinking seriously about what money would look like in space, and plenty of reasons to think fully verifiable, and self-settling currencies would be needed if humanity is ever to become a multiplanetary species or colonize worlds outside our solar system. Bitcoin was first to solve the Byzantine Generals Problem – a way to coordinate trust among people separated by time, distance and motivations – and fiat hasn’t.  We don’t know how UAPs work, and there are plenty of reasons to doubt what has been said about them. Grusch contradicted himself saying he both had access and was denied Pentagon intelligence on UAPs. And so much of the supposed eye-witness accounts of flying saucers can already be explained by faulty sensors on military aircraft. But I’d bet a dollar that if aliens exist, and they’re as barbaric as us to need money, their cash would be “digital” and inherently trustworthy.  It’d be impossible to enforce the rule of law on Mars. So wouldn’t you at least want a currency you could trust?  Samuel Edward Konkin III, the political philosopher who coined the term and advocated for agorism, got the closest to outlining what the world would look like if crypto was in wide circulation. In his New Libertarian Manifesto, Konkin argued against engaging in political processes, and instead encouraged people to withdraw their consent to be governed by only transacting in black or gray markets. Agoras for Konkin are opt-in free markets, which sounds pretty crypto.  There are some who would argue that bitcoin and crypto are not entirely antithetical to “the State,” and there’s a way to integrate these systems into wider society. But as a simple fact, it is true (if out of vogue to say in an age where BlackRock’s bitcoin products are celebrated) that Bitcoin was launched to steal back the power to transact freely from internet corporations, and shield some private information from surveillance.  See also: Why Bitcoin Needs Philosophy | Opinion  Maybe this would explain why the U.S. government is working to crush crypto, or at least regulate it into a version they can still control. I’d wager one more argument: if it’s true the Pentagon is working to suppress information that might lead us to one day exploring the cosmos by covering up everything related to our space-faring friends, then it makes total sense they’d suppress crypto.  According to renowned physicist (and Oppenheimer collaborator) Enrico Fermi, intelligent species likely have a set window of time to build the technological capabilities needed to leave their home base. And if that window closes – if wars lead to societal collapse or if scientific progress otherwise halts – we’ll miss the chance to slingshot through the universe before the sun engulfs the earth. Maybe crypto is as necessary to space exploration as fusion, and so must be throttled to prevent us from leaving our overlords.  And that’s really the point of crypto. In a world where it’s conceivable the government is lying about something as fundamental as earth-shattering as the existence of life beyond our planet, and feels the patronizing need to protect us from ourselves, there’s already an option to rebel. Do as Konkin did, and become an alien in your own land.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/07/28/aliens-exist-and-they-use-cryptocurrency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/acbe3ce2aa07eb4c68207954486109d56c4437b3-8192x4608.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42392894,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCyL1,1690568732,‘We’re Compute Cowboys’: Gideon Powell on the Pioneer Spirit Driving Bitcoin Mining,"Bitcoin miners may not get all the credit they deserve when it comes to pushing the innovation envelope. You might even call them modern day wildcatters, or the explorers who search the ends of the earth for untapped oil deposits. Or at least that’s what Gideon Powell, the chief executive of Cholla Inc., a Texas-based petrochemical exploration and investment, would say.  This story is part of CoinDesk's 2023 Mining Week, sponsored by Foundry.  “Thinking about this from a capability standpoint, the compute cowboys are unlocking new power markets for data centers and thinking about the future of industrial manufacturing. It’s all in its infancy,” Powell said. For many in the oil and gas industry, like Powell, whose family is also in the business, the mid-century energy explorers have risen to semi-mythological status. They’re a bit like the gauchos of the South American pampas, only that the wildcatters’ business built the modern world, Powell said.  Crypto, specifically Bitcoin for Powell, might also become foundational for whatever comes next for humanity. It’s almost assured that in the coming decades, the internet and nascent tech like artificial intelligence and augmented reality will become even more intertwined with everything. And all of that takes energy.  Bitcoin mining is not just an additional source of revenue for existing and future energy producers and data mine operators, but also a site of technological process. Powell said bitcoin miners have been at the forefront of computer chip cooling and efficiency, like the liquid-immersion machines that are coming online. A lot of these advances could go from giving specially-designed bitcoin mining a slight edge in what Powell calls the “ultimate free market,” bitcoin mining, to finding applications across the data industry.  See also: Mining Bitcoin Is an Act of Freedom | Opinion  CoinDesk talked with Powell for our Mining Week series about the three components needed to build data centers, why he’s betting on West Texas as an mining infrastructure hub and how crypto mining innovations bleed out into the rest of the silicon-based economy.  You mentioned the term compute cowboys when we were talking earlier. What exactly does that mean?  The bitcoin mining industry has dozens of legends that need to be told. My dad collected old Texas oil and gas history books and I can't read those without thinking about how we're in the middle of a revolution – bitcoin miners are quite like the wildcatters. These people did stuff that no one did before and laid the foundation for modern society. There are similar stories unfolding now about bitcoin mining. Everyone's depressed about the future, and I think the future is bright. You’ve just got to have the right vision and see people that are actually doing cool stuff.  Do you think Bitcoin is the foundation for the next phase of human advancement?  I think it's a critical pillar. In a way, we don't have the words yet to describe what a decentralized digital permissionless network is. It's not just a commodity. It's not just money. But I do think moving towards a more peer-to-peer system is critical to holding fast to equitable checks and balances across society. Nothing else can really align all these really unique incentives, it’s a bedrock which allows people to collaborate across time and space with no one's permission. Bitcoin just has an ethos of entrepreneurialism – the Frontier Spirit.  What do you think of Bitcoin maximalism?  I think “bitcoin maximalist” means different things to different people. At the most basic, it means someone is committed to Bitcoin and won’t pursue other currencies. But I do think it's important to have a healthy marketplace of competition. There's been a lot of innovation on other currencies, even if Bitcoin is the most robust one and we [at Cholla] want to be involved with that. But I don't think anybody should have a monopoly on anything.  How exactly does Bitcoin fit into the energy exploration business – do you see it developing into its own venture?  Historically Cholla has been an oil and gas exploration company very focused on finding hydrocarbons and thinking about how to get them out of the ground. It’s very wildcatter on the front end. About five years ago, I started researching global power markets which led to an interest in traditional power grids. We were actually looking to build power generation that was carbon neutral. But it can be a low margin business.  We eventually pivoted, and said let’s not sell power, let's invest in what consumes power – which is where cryptocurrency mining comes in. We developed the first speculative bitcoin mining campus in West Texas and I got stories for days on that one. Over the last few years, we've really evolved to where we're not just an oil and gas exploration company: we're a diversified exploration company. So we have a few different divisions, including traditional oil and gas exploration. We've actually been building out a new division called Cholla Energy focused on where we can build new campuses for future bitcoin miners and data centers.  Apart from the family history, is there any reason you set up in Texas?  Bitcoin miners are the most fungible thing around, they can go places that traditional high performance compute data centers cannot. It's just too risky. We're all in on West Texas and we've bought a lot of land out there and we're spec developing it. The long term goal is get all the long lead items – you know, the things that are years in the works – like land power, and now connectivity fiber and bringing all that to West Texas.  You keep reading about how we're out of power. We don't have enough power or land, apparently. Actually, we have gigawatts of power and you know, West Texas has some of the highest percentages of wind and solar in the country. It’s absolutely going to dominate as a compute headquarters for both bitcoin mining and a few other classes of data centers that are emerging.  What about the metaverse and AI as opportunities?  A lot of people talk about bitcoin mining companies pivoting to AI. In reality, it’s a very different business – even if the foundations are the same. You need land, you need a lot of power and you need connectivity. When you're talking about the metaverse, and that amount of compute that's going to be needed, you need orders of magnitude more power consumption globally.  Five to 10 years out, we think West Texas is one of the only places in the world that could handle these gigawatt-plus campuses. We've been land banking and working on the high voltage infrastructures, and really taking care of front end items to ensure that high-performance compute customers, you know, have confidence they can scale. But we’re not building our own data centers.  The absence of reliable, affordable energy ensures that civilizations do not prosper  So it's very similar to bitcoin mining, you need better connectivity – and then a workforce. Five years ago there were no bitcoin miners in West Texas. Now, it's pretty much established as one of the headquarters of large scale bitcoin mining. All this building is circular, eventually an economy will be formed around it that will bring the workforce, the electricians, the technicians and the people needed to run future data centers. Bitcoin miners again are these wildcatters building all the initial stuff. The buildings might not be able to be repurposed, but all the infrastructure and long lead items, we can take care of all that right now to de-risk future AI.  Bitcoin miners are also pioneers in a technical sense. But I’ve never been sure if that stuff could be repurposed in other industries.  You know, really, the bitcoin miners were pushing the absolute boundaries on bleeding edge cooling tech and power management strategies. So everything we're doing on bitcoin mining, from high density compute to the different types of air immersion, direct to chip phasing – all of that is really being pioneered by the bitcoin miners. So the scale of what things have gotten through in the bitcoin mining side are helping bring about a lot of economies of scale, and de-risking these other technologies. That's what bitcoin miners love. We love solving big complex challenges that the market needs.  You mentioned connectivity a few times – I feel like this is part of the story that isn't told too often. What exactly is involved here? Are you talking about laying down fiber optics?  So really, the three components of any traditional data center is land, power and connectivity. It’s why data centers cluster where there’s fiber [optic cables]. Like Google went to Midlothian, Texas, on the outskirts of Dallas Fort Worth and then you saw other data centers popping up around it because Google brought in the resources and the fiber, which then can be backboned on to other other data centers. With bitcoin mining, you don't need fiber. All you need is a decent internet connection. And with Starlink, you can get that anywhere in the world.  But some data centers are mission critical facilities, they need to be guaranteed 100%. They need to be able to transmit data back and forth in a couple of milliseconds, and not experience downtime. With the kind of emerging parallel computing and batch processing for AI rendering, these are not time sensitive. And so a new class of data center is going to emerge where latency isn't as important.  That opens up your options, and lowers your capital costs – maybe we can locate these new AI data centers in different locations. Maybe it doesn't need to be near Dallas, for instance. Would you accept 5% downtime per year? Would you be willing to turn off and turn on depending on energy demand, or only consume during the lowest hours? You can shut down your rendering and not lose the process, and then start up when the sun and winds start blowing again.  Like miners.  Bitcoin miners have been pioneering with demand response. The difference to some extent is it's clear for bitcoin miners what their opportunity cost is – but maybe not for AI. So really data centers are just going to be more complex.  Let’s talk a little bit about the regulatory landscape. In Texas a few legislatures put forward proposals to curtail bitcoin mining. Is that a long tail risk for you?  It's always a risk. I mean, what bitcoin miners do a really good job of is explaining the value proposition for grids and working to arrange [private-public] programs to incentivize grid reliability. That is their trump card, being able to drop gigawatts of load in real time. It’s a game changer. In ERCOT specifically bitcoin miners utilize this more effectively than anybody, and it benefits all the stakeholders and customers in Texas. But there's always gonna be people that have concerns.  Could you unpack why you say the more consumption, the better?  Energy is the input for everything. Every single thing we do, we're using energy and the price of that affects that. There’s a lot of talk of wanting to lower emissions, which is correlated with power consumption. That isn't necessarily true. What I'm focused on is how do you advance human prosperity and individual liberty? And if you look back through the history of the world, the absence of reliable, affordable energy ensures that civilizations do not prosper. Lowering emissions is one thing, but we cannot talk about just mandating less power consumption.  See also: Bitcoin Mining Computing Power May Drop as Much as 30% Next Halving  Likewise, more efficiency within the power sector is always a good thing. That's less resources. But straight up lowering economic growth is just not a conversation we should entertain at all. I mean, we have infinite resources – we're never going to run out of oil, we're never going to run out of gas, we're never going to run out of solar molecules. We just need to unleash more innovation in the space.  Out of curiosity, do you pay attention to what's going on with fusion?  We're generation agnostic. What's great about bitcoin mining is it's the first time in recorded history where you kind of have this democratization of innovation. Like if you wanted to innovate in fusion, you needed billions of dollars – same for any power generation technology. You really need to be independently wealthy, or a massive corporation. But bitcoin’s profit motive puts that in the hands of any individual that can plug in a computer and find a decent internet connection.  So whereas there was a small concentration of energy entrepreneurs, you now have a massive global network of anybody that can conceivably innovate to make things better, more affordable. And you're instantly rewarded by the bitcoin network.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MARKET | MINING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/07/28/were-compute-cowboys-gideon-powell-on-the-pioneer-spirit-driving-bitcoin-mining,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/694752c50b43830cc878d391f0971ca0d57a45b0-2187x1230.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Recent on-chain data shows that Bitcoin whale exchange deposits reached $275 million in a single day as the cryptocurrency continues to struggle to cross over $30,000. Bitcoin Whales Moving Funds to Exchanges Tweets from the whale transaction tracker @whale_alert indicate that a total of 9,406 Bitcoins, with an approximate worth of $275 million, have been moved into exchanges through separate transactions. Related Reading: Ripple Attorney Withdraws From SEC Lawsuit, Will It Affect XRP? The vast majority of these trades entered Binance twice, with the largest single deposit being the entry of 2,459 BTC with a total value of $72.6 million. Another significant transaction included the deposit of 1,499 BTC with a total value of $44.3 million into the Binance exchange. The actions of these Bitcoin whales, or large holders, often significantly impact the overall market. There are a few possible for big money transfers, but when whales make large deposits to exchanges, it usually signals they are preparing to sell in large volumes, which can crash the market, at least temporarily. Many traders consider this a bearish signal and can spark worry that prices may soon drop. For smaller investors, this can mean opportunity or risk ahead. The price of Bitcoin crossed over $30,000 last month, showing promising signs of an upward trend for investors. However, the cryptocurrency has experienced a slight decline in the last seven days, dropping by around 1.57%. Further massive selloffs by whales can have a counter effect on this bullish sentiment.

On a weekly look, lesser known tokens OGN, KNC, and ASTR were among those posting strong gains.  With just three days remaining in July, bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) are poised to finish in negative territory for the month. Over the most recent seven days, bitcoin and ether fell -1.59% and -0.81%, respectively, very much in line with what has been a range-bound trading environment for the entire month.  Both of the cryptos have moved into neutral territory per their respective CoinDesk Indices trend indicators. The gauges, calculated daily, are designed to illustrate price direction and momentum strength using a series of moving averages.  Broader moves across the entire digital asset landscape are captured within the Coindesk Market Indices (CMI), and all CMI sectors finished in the red this week, including the DeFi Index (DCF), down 1.24%. The weakest performer was the Culture and Entertainment Index (CNE), off 3.24%.  The monthly picture is marginally more promising, with all CMI sectors finishing in the green, with the exception of the Currency Index (CCY), down 0.39% in July, in part thanks to bitcoin’s sizable weighting in that grouping.  Of the 183 assets within CMI, 112, or 61% have outperformed bitcoin in July.  Weekly movers  NFT platform Origin Protocol (OGN) rose 32% over the past week, while DeFi's Kyber Network (KNC) and smart contract platform Astar (ASTR) added 23% and 22%, respectively.  With each of these tokens boasting market caps below $300 million, they are apt to fall underneath the radar. Still their sector alignment can provide insight into whether their performance was in line with similar assets.  OGN’s gain this week stands in contrast to the Culture and Entertainment Index (CNE), which was lower by 3.1%. KNC’s advance came alongside a 2.8% decline for the DeFi Index (DCF), and ASTR’s rise outperformed the 1.2% fall for the Smart Contract Platform Index (SMT).  Looking ahead to next week  On the heels of this week’s Federal Reserve interest rate increase and inflation data, next week’s macroeconomic focus will center on jobs, in particular Friday’s Nonfarm Payrolls report for July. Less followed, but also of interest will be Tuesday’s Job Openings and Labor Market Survey (JOLTS).

Bitcoin’s (BTC) dip below the $30,000 level is likely a short-term correction in an otherwise bullish trend, Rachel Lin, CEO of derivatives decentralized exchange SynFutures, said in a Friday note.  “Despite bitcoin's fall below $30,000, there is a conspicuous lack of $30,000 call [option] selling from bearish traders,” Lin said. “This suggests they don't foresee the $30,000 level transforming into significant resistance, at least in the near term.”  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, bitcoin traded above $30,000 for most of July, reaching a near one-year high of $31,800 price earlier this month, with asset management giant BlackRock’s spot bitcoin ETF application and a partially favorable court ruling about Ripple's XRP among the positive catalysts. The uptrend, however, fizzled recently with prices dipping below $29,000 earlier this week before a modest bounce to the current $29,350.  Losing the $30,000 level, however, is likely just a short-term deviation, according to Lin.  “While this technical drop may induce concern, given the robust uptrend over the past six months, it's sensible to consider this merely a short-term correction,"" she said, adding that the $31,000 call option “continues to attract high open interest” from traders. Lin said this is a sign that the price level poses a “potent resistance” in case of a bounce in BTC’s price.  Options are trading instruments that give investors the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at a set price at a later date. A call option buyer gets the right to buy and those who purchase puts get the right to sell. For example, bitcoin traders often use call options to make cheap, leveraged bullish bets on the price.  Singapore-based crypto services provider Matrixport advised investors to sell spot BTC and buy call options instead to optimize returns at a time when volatility is suppressed in the crypto market.

Recent data shows that the cryptocurrency has been recording “crab-like” price action in the short term, but operators favor the long side of their trades. Related Reading: Why This Billionaire Continues To Advocate For Bitcoin Amid Surging US Debt? As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $29,700 with a 0.7% loss in the last 24 hours and a 2% loss in the previous week. The cryptocurrency’s implied volatility has been trending to the downside while BTC’s price holds still at its current levels. Low Volatility Set The Stage For A Bitcoin Price Explosion? Data from a report posted by crypto analytics firm Block Scholes via Deribit indicates that Bitcoin and Ethereum traders have been seeking long exposure to these cryptocurrencies. As mentioned above, this behavior coincides with a decline in delivered volatility. As a result, the BTC and ETH perpetual swap markets are experiencing a shift in funding rates. This measure determines the percentage paid by long to short positions at a given time. The chart below shows that funding rates have been trending to the upside since last September 2022. At that time, the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies hit a multi-year low. Now, the BTC price experienced a 100% recovery from those levels leading to a change in the derivatives sector. The chart shows that funding rates across the BTC, ETH, and USDC trading pairs have been positive for the past three months. This data shows that traders are going long and willing to pay short positions for their exposure. A positive funding rate is often linked to the sentiment among operators and could hint at an upcoming bullish run when found on platforms like Deribit, where “smart money” trades. Why Are BTC Traders Going Long? Conversely, Block Scholes wonders: why are traders going long when implied volatility fell to new all-time lows? What’s driving operators for long exposure while the price trades sideways so much that they are willing to pay a premium? The report stated: We find it somewhat odd that traders are willing to pay such a consistently high rate for long exposure despite such low expectations of volatility.

Venture capital firm, Sequoia Capital, has cut its cryptocurrency fund by over 65% from $585 million to $200 million, the WSJ reports citing persons familiar with the matter. Sequoia Capital Downsizes Two Funds According to the WSJ, which cites persons familiar with the matter, the venture capital firm reduced the size of two of its funds, including its Sequoia Crypto Fund. The Silicon Valley-based tech-focused venture capital firm informed investors it would reduce its crypto and ecosystem fund. According to the firm, the adjustments reflect a changed market, with the crypto fund now more focused on investing in newer startups after the market slump reduced its chances to invest in larger projects. The VC firm had invested a sizeable $150 million in the now-collapsed FTX exchange. The WSJ report indicates the Sequoia Crypto Fund has been reduced from $585 million to $200 million. The WSJ also reports Sequoia’s ecosystem fund was reduced from $900 million to $450 million. The firm’s ecosystem fund, reduced by 50%, invests in other smaller venture funds and solo investors. A further report by the Financial Times (FT) states Sequoia returned over “$15 billion to its investors over the past three years.” According to the FT, the firm said: “We made these changes to sharpen our focus on seed-stage opportunities and to provide liquidity to our limited partners.” Sequoia first announced its crypto fund in February 2022 and said it was looking to raise around a $500-600 million crypto fund which invests exclusively in the crypto space. Sequoia Capital India was also the majority investor in a Polygon funding round which saw the Ethereum scaling platform raise a total of $450 million.

42392897,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCyQ9,1690561325,A BlackRock BTC ETF Wouldn't Be Possible Without Bitcoin Miners,"All eyes are on BlackRock.  After last year’s carnage of FTX and other high-profile fallouts, the crypto industry is pinning its hopes on legacy finance muscling through the long-awaited Bitcoin spot ETF.  In addition to BlackRock, Fidelity and Ark Investments have filed for Bitcoin spot ETFs, paving the way for institutional capital to flood into the digital asset. Crypto exchanges like Coinbase (who will be BlackRock’s surveillance sharing partner for the ETF) may clash with the SEC, but Wall Street routinely works with the agency to push through these financial products.  While it isn’t a guarantee we will see a Bitcoin spot ETF soon – even BlackRock isn’t immune to the SEC’s stonewalling and its surveillance partner remains under investigation – it is looking increasingly likely, especially with the pressure of multiple firms coinciding with the momentum from Ripple Labs’ partially successful lawsuit.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's 2023 Mining Week, sponsored by Foundry.Samir Tabar is CEO of Bit Digital, a bitcoin mining company listed on Nasdaq (BTBT).  The arrival of a spot ETF would be a milestone for crypto and is made possible by the miners who have ensured the integrity of the Bitcoin network. From early test validations following the publication of the Bitcoin white paper to the buildout of entire operations across the United States, Asia, and Europe, the past decade has been fascinating for mining, and miners again find themselves at a crucial inflection point to shape the industry as stakeholders.  Adoption is bittersweet  In the years leading up to the recent flurry of spot filings, publicly-traded mining companies were how institutional investors gained exposure to Bitcoin. Due to the lack of regulatory clarity for digital assets, investors opted for traditional financial vehicles with stock offerings and compliance requirements, which also alleviated the burden of self-custody. While several other low-maintenance options existed for exposure to Bitcoin, including purchasing Microstrategy stock or the Grayscale Futures ETF, miners were always closer to the core product.  The inevitable spot ETF backed by a major financial institution like BlackRock or Fidelity is bittersweet. Approval of any one of these ETFs by the SEC would signal a regulatory green light while providing investors with direct exposure to Bitcoin – there would likely be a price increase in the underlying asset which miners have spent this decade building substantial positions in (i.e. everyone involved makes money).  But a spot Bitcoin ETF also raises the uncomfortable prospect of outflows in capital from mining stocks to Wall Street financial products, wherein banks enter a more favorable regulatory climate and benefit enormously from operating expense ratio (OER) fees built into the ETFs. As I highlighted in a OpEd for CoinDesk this spring, miners will meanwhile face a lower-margin environment with the “halvening” event next year set to reduce the amount of mineable Bitcoin by 50%.  There is irony in miners building the world’s first decentralized monetary system — assuming all the risk for over a decade while dealing with hostile regulatory scrutiny and attacks from lawmakers — only to turn it over to Wall Street for a last-minute assist.  The next era of mining  Miners, however, have always been aware of the timeline surrounding mineable Bitcoin as first outlined in Satoshi Nakomoto’s white paper. The beauty is that we have created a playbook for bridging emerging technology, institutional investment, and alternative sources of energy, while providing economic opportunities to the communities who welcome it. While Bitcoin’s “proof of work” system may seem limiting on first glance, miners have used it as the basis for our own decentralized network with footprints across multiple jurisdictions, instantly adaptable to regulatory tailwinds and technological advancements.  A Bitcoin spot ETF validates the validators. Its arrival would be a sign that securing the network always had global significance, and that there is even more of a role to play as promising new technology finds its place in the global economy. As Wall Street and regulators debate the specifics of a spot Bitcoin ETF, miners are developing profitable business models with Ethereum and Artificial Intelligence, making the ETF debate already seem dated. I noted in another CoinDesk piece from earlier this year how our company, Bit Digital, had developed an Ethereum “Flywheel Model” wherein mined Bitcoin can be converted into Ethereum and then staked for rewards.  Mining infrastructure such as alternative energy sources, cooling systems, and computing systems likewise are being used to process machine learning workloads. Those who would call this a “pivot” misunderstand the fluidity of mining, and how the sector has grown beyond Bitcoin to offer investors exposure to Ethereum and AI, while incorporating emerging technologies requiring energy output into a sustainable model. Again, miners are innovating and tapping into the promise of new markets and technologies, as Wall Street plays catch-up years after the fact.  A spot Bitcoin ETF heralds a triumph for the guardians of the network. Our full power is only just being realized.

Clearly, many people are enthusiastic about this project, which Worldcoin posits as a way to empower humanity in the face of artificial intelligence’s rapid expansion, with its proof of unique personhood solution intended to distinguish people from deep-fake bots and underpin an equitable distribution of all that AI-generated wealth.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The token leapt more than 40% within minutes of Worldcoin’s mainnet going live on Monday as some 250,000 people who’d scanned their irises via one of Worldcoin’s silvery orbs received an airdropped token. Some 2 million people worldwide have now signed up to be scanned, with Altman tweeting this week that this was happening at a rate of one person every eight seconds.  Jeff Wilser visited Worldcoin’s offices in Berlin and delivered an in-depth feature about Worldcoin’s incubation and launch, including the nugget that the CEO had never held a job before helming this complex logistical and regulatory effort.  Many are upset by this project. The hew and cry was especially loud from within the crypto community, with lots of allusions to a Big Brother-like leviathan gaining access to highly sensitive personal data.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - The Untold Story of Worldcoin’s Launch: Inside the Orb  Our own David Z. Morris has done a good job staking out the critic’s side of it. In a column a month ago, Morris acknowledged the potential benefits of Worldcoin’s universal basic income (UBI) ambitions but added that Altman and his cofounders “have hit on a way to make this appealing premise seem utterly dystopian.” He warned of the dangers of a centralized entity gathering retina prints and noted that the $5000 cost per orb – along with logistics challenges of distributing it worldwide – make a mockery of any plans for a “universal” rollout. (In a side note, Morris added that the name “orb” is “creepy as hell,” suggesting it implies “the Eye of Sauron, Foucault’s Panopticon, the Saudi Intelligence Orb, Saruman’s palantir, and the for-profit spy firm named after it.”)  On the other side are backers like Jake Brukhman, a partner at Coinfund, which invested in Worldcoin in 2021. On CoinDesk TV, Brukhman predicted the project would onboard billions of people into cryptocurrency, with the financial inclusion benefits that come with it. Brukhman, Altman and other supporters inside and outside Worldcoin dismiss the privacy concerns by highlighting that neither the company’s servers nor its devices store any raw human data, converting the scans instead into unique, non-discoverable hash codes.  A more balanced, but still cautionary take came from Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, who in a blog post applauded Worldcoin’s commitment to privacy and the sophisticated technology it is using to protect people’s data. But he highlighted “four major risks” with the project, noting that there were no ways within a centralized model to guarantee that people’s data is absolutely safe. He said it’s impossible to know whether a “backdoor” was built into the hardware of the orb that would allow the company, or perhaps a government, to access the data at some point.  I kinda sit in the middle.  Notwithstanding Vitalik’s point on the impossibility of perfect privacy, I think fears of a major breach of people’s biometric data and the threats that could pose to them are likely overblown – or at least they’re no greater than the privacy threats we face elsewhere. (We store far more data on our iPhones using similar device-localized cryptographic protections, for example, and let’s not forget that the biggest crypto exchanges must collect “know-your-customer” (KYC) identifying information on all their clients.)  My concern is with the corporate centrality of it all and with the misaligned incentives it will foster. Why is UBI even the responsibility of a private company? Doesn’t that create uneasy dependency among its poorer recipients? And what exactly is the token for? Worldcoin seems to be hoping it will form the basis of an ecosystem of decentralized AI applications as it promotes its software development toolkit for developers.  Read more: Eliza Gkritsi - Worldcoin Could Enable Wider Distribution of Crypto Than Even Bitcoin, Says CoinFund  But, for now, it feels like the project is designed to bootstrap participation via speculative fervor, which is in turn fueled by the buzz around a high-profile project and founder, which creates a juicy exit for early token holders and sets post-launch investors up for losses. (Sure enough, the WLD token suffered sharp declines later into the week.) With many taking issue with the tokenomics of the Worldcoin rollout, which severely limits total circulating supply, the whole thing looks to many like a hyped-up money grab. Rampant profiteering around something as important as people’s identity cannot end well.  This just brings home a point I’ve made before about the lessons to draw from Web2 as we barrel into this new AI era. The risk is not with the technology per se – we’ve known for years that AI is capable of destroying us. It’s that if we concentrate control over these technologies among a handful of overly powerful companies that are incentivized to use them as proprietary “black box” systems in pursuit of profit, they will rapidly move into dangerous, humanity-harming territory, just as the Web2 platforms did.  Still, there’s at least one positive that could arise out of the Worldcoin project. It is drawing attention to the need for some kind of proof of humanity, which could give oomph to the many interesting projects seeking to give people greater control over their identities in the Web3/AI age. The answer to proving and elevating authentic humanity could lie in capturing the “social graph” of our online connections, relationships, interactions and authorized credentials via decentralized identity (DID) models or initiatives like the decentralized social networking protocol (DSNP) that’s part of Project Liberty. Or it might yet lie in a biometrics solution like the one Worldcoin is working on, though hopefully with a more decentralized, less corporatized structure. What’s clear is that we must do something.  Consider a somewhat salacious example: already AI bots have created extremely life-like female digital characters to appear in pornographic videos sold to OnlyFans patrons who think they are real performers. You might not hold pornography in high regard and probably think that if gullible, desperate men fall for this, they deserve no sympathy. But consider what this means for the human performers.  For all the criticism it receives, OnlyFans, or more specifically the direct-to-patron model it’s built on, has been applauded by sex work advocates for finally giving performers a safe environment in which to earn income on their own terms. If they can’t adequately prove that they’re human and are outcompeted for clients’ dollars by an army of fake bots, what are their options? Might they have to return to street prostitution, where, yes, they can easily prove their humanity but face the risk of violence at the hands of clients and pimps?  Every person deserves dignity in the digital age. Achieving that is going to require balancing reliable solutions that differentiate humans from machines with commitments to protect our privacy and our most essential personal data.",NEUTRAL,WLD,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | WLD,Michael J.

This comes after a motion was filed earlier in the month for Anna R. Gressel to withdraw as attorney of defendant Ripple Labs. This recent withdrawal has cast a shadow of uncertainty as holders of XRP ponder on the likely impact of this development. Ripple Remains Upbeat Despite Attorney’s Withdrawal According to details in the filing made at the District Court for the Southern District of New York on July 27, Ripple is asking for the leave of the court to withdraw Lisa R. Zornberg as an attorney to the defendants in the ongoing XRP vs. SEC lawsuit. Related Reading: VC Firm Sequoia Capital Slashes Crypto Fund By 65% Amid Bear Market Ripple is appealing to the court to grant Lisa R. Zornberg of the popular Debevoise & Plimpton LLP permission to withdraw as an attorney in the lawsuit. This is in light of the fact that Lisa R. Zornberg will no longer be working with the law firm from July 31. The foremost federal prosecutor was appointed by New York City Mayor Eric Adams as City Hall’s Chief Counsel earlier this week. However, this move does not in any way affect Ripple’s relationship with Debevoise & Plimpton LLP as other attorneys of the firm will continue representing Ripple Labs in the case. Ripple has also reiterated that the withdrawal of Lisa R. Zornberg does not in any way affect its interests, including those of CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen. It’s also important to note that the court had previously approved withdrawal motions for three attorneys Kylie Chiseul Kim, Clayton J. Masterman, and Anna R. Gressel to exit the lawsuit. Attorney Withdraws As Case Grinds to a Close The withdrawal of Lisa R. Zornbergs comes in the wake of Judge Analisa Torres’ referral of the lawsuit to Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn. Magistrate Judge Netburn instructed the SEC and Ripple to reach an agreement on three mutually suitable dates to hold a settlement conference on issues like institutional sales of XRP. Related Reading: Bitcoin Set To Accelerate As A Store Of Value In Wake Of Bank Collapses, Cathie Wood XRP’s price witnessed a surge in the wake of the summary judgment entered in favor of Ripple.

However, despite the crypto community’s privacy idealism, people are starting to use it to figure out who was behind some major exploits.  Arkham Intel Exchange, a new platform that incentivizes the unmasking of anonymous crypto users, stirred up controversy recently among the famously privacy-sensitive digital asset community.  But despite those concerns, some people are using it in service of a seemingly good goal: figuring out who’s behind rug pulls and other crypto exploits.  On Arkham’s marketplace, which debuted on July 10, there are seven bounties, collectively worth about 168,000 ARKM (or $92,400), focused on identifying people who engaged in some kind of bad behavior, according to CoinDesk calculations.  Read more: Arkham Intelligence Rolls Out Crypto Data Marketplace; Privacy Advocates Cry Foul  The story orbits around the age-old conflict between idealism and pragmatism. From its earliest days, crypto was pitched to and well-received by people who cherish their privacy. It didn’t take long, though, to realize it was possible to figure out the owner of superficially anonymous crypto wallets, giving rise to services like Arkham, Chainalysis and Nansen. Law enforcement and Arkham users alike have used this fact to try to chase down crooks and scammers by piercing the veil of blockchain anonymity.  In one example this week, a meme-coin project called TOWELIE is accused of being a rug pull (a scheme in which investors pour money into a project, only for the project backers to abscond with it). Someone put a bounty on IDing its backers on the Arkham platform, worth 580 ARKM (which equals about $324 of Arkham’s token).  TOWELIE keeps a low profile. There’s no official social media account on X (née Twitter) or Discord. A message sent via the Blockscan Chat to the project’s addresses asking whether they were engaging in a rug pull wasn’t immediately returned.

15387886,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544817,1690556416,Bitcoin Rally May Not Resume Until This Happens,"Bitcoin has continued to stagnate recently as another recovery move has failed to prosper. So here’s an indicator that may hint when a break could happen. Bitcoin Rally May Not Resume Until The Stablecoin Market Cap Goes Up Around the start of this week, Bitcoin observed a sharp plunge that had taken the asset’s price from the $30,000 level down to the $29,000 mark. A couple of days back, however, the coin had started surging again and had reclaimed the $26,600 level. This uplift in the price had come as the US Fed had announced a 25 bps interest rate hike, but before long, the recovery efforts had run out of steam, and now, the cryptocurrency has already retraced its gains from the rally. BTC has gone back towards the $29,000 level recently | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView Earlier, Bitcoin had been stuck in a phase of stagnation above the $30,000 level for more than a month, but with the plunge in the price, this streak had been broken. Related Reading: PEPE Whales Load Up Their Bags As Memecoin Jumps 13% The asset now sticking near the $29,000 level may mean, however, that volatility hasn’t truly returned for the asset yet, as it still continues to consolidate, just around a different level. When a true break away from this stagnation may happen and the rally would return could possibly depend on the total supply of all the stablecoins. As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, range-breaking price rises in Bitcoin this year have generally only come whenever the stablecoin supply has registered an increase. The value of the metric seems to have been heading down in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As the quant has marked in the chart, the major price increases in the past few months have generally preceded a sharp local increase in the supply of the stablecoins. Usually, an increase in the stablecoin supply can suggest two things. First, there may be a fresh injection of capital happening into the market, as investors ask for more of these fiat-tied tokens to be minted. And second, some holders of other coins like Bitcoin may be selling their coins to seek the relative safety that the stablecoins offer. Either way, such investors who hold their capital in the form of stables do so because they eventually plan to dip (back) into the volatile side of the market. Due to this reason, the total stablecoin supply may be looked at as a store of buying pressure that can be deployed into assets like Bitcoin. From the chart, it’s visible that it hasn’t exactly been the increase in the stablecoin supply that has fueled the price surges this year, but rather the decline in the metric that followed shortly after. Related Reading: Bitcoin At Decision Point As Investors Hold Neutral Sentiment These decreases in the supply suggested a transfer of capital into Bitcoin and others, which is why their prices observed a bullish boost. It’s also visible in the graph, however, that the stablecoin supply has been on a net decline in this period, meaning that the dry powder tied up in these tokens has been constantly running out. Based on this trend, if the stablecoin supply doesn’t see another major cash injection in the coming days, then the Bitcoin rally may not be able to resume. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $29,200, down 1% in the last 24 hours.

42392883,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCxVj,1690554639,Why Ethereum Ditching Mining Isn't as Green as Advertised,"Last September, the long-awaited Ethereum “Merge” finally occurred and the Ethereum network successfully transitioned from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS). Prior to the Merge the security of the Ethereum (ETH) network had been guaranteed by proof-of-work, i.e., the same mechanism that still powers Bitcoin (BTC). Since the Merge the security of the Ethereum network is now guaranteed by the collective stake of hundreds of thousands of validators who are punished, or “slashed,” if they go offline, double sign transactions or otherwise misbehave.  This story is part of CoinDesk's 2023 Mining Week, sponsored by Foundry. Lane Rettig is a core developer at Spacemesh, and a former Ethereum core developer. He’s an advocate for open source software, open protocols, and open systems.  On the face of it this may seem like a massive accomplishment for Ethereum because it allowed the network to completely retire proof-of-work mining and, thus, to significantly reduce its energy consumption. Indeed, amidst ongoing mainstream FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) around the energy intensity of proof-of-work mining, the Ethereum Foundation marketing machine spun the upgrade as the “greenification” of Ethereum and institutional investors who won’t touch bitcoin are now holding ether as a result.  As a former Ethereum core developer who briefly worked on the technologies behind the Merge I have mixed feelings about the upgrade. I feel that it’s a major technical accomplishment and has certain advantages for Ethereum, but I strongly disagree with the economic arguments used to justify it: among them that staking is less wasteful, more secure and increases profitability. Let’s pick apart these claims one by one.  Claim #1: Proof-of-stake is less wasteful  This is the main and most important claim made about the Ethereum Merge: that it reduced Ethereum energy consumption by around 99.5%. This figure is shortsighted and misleading for several reasons. Strictly speaking it is true that Ethereum’s energy consumption fell after the Merge, but what matters to humanity is total energy consumption.  All of those GPUs, or graphics processing units, that were previously used to mine Ethereum didn’t disappear overnight. Many found uses in other applications, most obviously mining other PoW chains or AI applications. Those GPUs exist because of Ethereum, in a sense, they still exist post-Merge, and many are still consuming a lot of energy. Older GPU models that have few other uses and have been retired have mostly found their way to landfills, which also isn’t the greenest outcome.  In other words, claiming a 99.5% energy reduction is accounting sleight of hand.  What’s more, today there are nearly 700,000 validators running on the Ethereum proof-of-stake Beacon Chain. While it’s possible to run many validators on one system, a conservative estimate still yields on the order of 10,000-100,000 computers running Ethereum, each consuming bandwidth, energy and terabytes of disk storage. While these machines use less energy than Ethereum’s old miners, there’s almost certainly far more validators than there were miners due to lower resource requirements (read: you can easily run a validator at home without specialized hardware).  See also: Enhancing Profitability of Wind and Solar Through Bitcoin | Opinion  Finally, the market for maximal extractable value, or MEV, has exploded in the wake of the Merge. MEV, which allows sophisticated actors with powerful computers to calculate arbitrage opportunities and bribe block producers to prioritize their transactions in order to capitalize on them, thrives in an ecosystem of hundreds of thousands of bribable validators. I don’t know what percentage of miners were participating in MEV prior to the Merge, but today 90% of validators are doing so.  And all of those arbitrageurs are now consuming enormous amounts of computational power: some likely even using those same GPUs, which have applications in high frequency trading and statistical arbitrage.  In short, looking strictly at energy consumed by miners is short sighted. One must consider the total social cost of operating a network, including, now, the opportunity cost of $41 billion locked in Ethereum stake, which cannot be put to more productive social use, such as investing in high potential projects.  Claim #2: Proof-of-stake is more secure  This is another primary claim made by proof-of-stake proponents. By now the topic has been explored to death and the details are beyond the scope of this article but the argument in brief is as follows: Proof-of-stake is more secure because it’s possible to surgically target an adversary who attacks a proof-of-stake blockchain by coordinating a social fork (otherwise known as a user activated soft fork, aka, UASF) to remove the attacker’s staked capital.  By contrast adversaries of proof-of-work networks have the advantage that, to render a 51% attack ineffectual, the network must also render all honest mining hardware ineffectual by changing the proof-of-work algorithm. This is a “nuclear option” because, while it would stop an attack by an adversary with powerful, specialized mining hardware called ASICs (short for application specific integrated circuits), it would instantly destroy the entire capital stock of all honest miners as well.  This argument doesn’t hold water for several reasons. Firstly, unlike in PoW, a cartel controlling more than half of the stake can silently, invisibly, and permanently capture the entire network. Secondly, an attack on a PoW chain is in the first place less likely than an attack on a PoS chain. It’s easier to attack a PoS chain because doing so doesn’t require scarce assets like hardware or electricity. Actually, it doesn’t require staked assets either: the attacker only needs to acquire keys of former validators, or very briefly operate a huge number of validators (anyway a profitable enterprise). With these keys in hand an attacker can carry out a long range, costless simulation attack, which would produce a blockchain that for all practical purposes appears equally valid to the canonical chain.  This problem is known among Ethereum developers as “weak subjectivity”: subjective because it relies on social information rather than math and cryptography, and weak because that information is imperfect and can be controlled by an adversary. In Ethereum that social information takes the form of adding known good “checkpoints” to the code to prevent reorgs that are too long, i.e., to prevent an attacking longer chain from replacing the legitimate chain. By contrast, in Bitcoin, the objectively verifiable longest chain always wins. Social coordination is handy in many situations but it’s far from trustless or apolitical, and Bitcoin’s “longest chain wins” rule is much more credibly neutral.  It’s worth noting here that adversarial forks also become costless under PoS, whereas in PoW one must convince miners to switch and mine on a different chain. “Work” must still be done to defend against and respond to these attacks, but the “work” takes a different form – and, as mentioned, it’s much more subjective.  Claim #3: Proof-of-stake increases profitability  A popular meme, “Ultrasound Money,” began circulating in Ethereum circles around the time of the Merge. It refers to the fact that the overall block subsidy fell substantially after the Merge. This, combined with the burn mechanism introduced a year earlier in EIP-1559 that burns tokens as network activity increases, means that the Ethereum network is often deflationary: in times of relatively high demand, the portion of burnt fees exceeds issuance.  Nevermind the fact that “sound money” refers to something else entirely and the fact that Ethereum monetary policy has changed so often means it’s not sound money; this doesn’t seem to discourage Ethereans.  The thing is, as articulated so well by Bitcoin OG Paul Sztorc years ago, network security doesn’t come for free and attempts to circumvent this fact are just more creative accounting. In an efficient market paying miners or validators less can only have two possible effects: either they stop mining/validating and go elsewhere, making the network less secure, or they get compensated in other ways.  See also: Why Bitcoin Miners Need to Take Ethereum Seriously | Opinion  Sztorc refers to the latter as “Obscured PoW.” In the case of Ethereum today there are two major forms of Obscured PoW and associated cost. The first, already discussed above, is the enormous opportunity cost of the locked capital.  The second, also alluded to above, is MEV, which represents money captured from unsophisticated, everyday network users. When the network spends more on security, miners consolidate, MEV opportunities diminish and everyday users pay more in the form of inflation. By contrast, with lower spending under PoS, everyday users pay instead in the form of hidden transaction fees due to MEV. Over $1 billion worth of MEV is estimated to have been extracted on the Ethereum network alone over the past two to three years, to say nothing of the various side chains and layer 2s, and cross-domain MEV between and among them.  A major milestone, with flaws  Ethereum-flavor proof-of-stake represents a major milestone in the development of public, permissionless distributed systems and consensus mechanisms. It’s an improvement over permissioned, delegated proof-of-stake and I’m happy that it exists. It likely has socially valuable use cases that we’ll understand better over time. But let’s not fool ourselves into believing that it’s somehow inherently better – less wasteful, cheaper and more secure – than proof-of-work.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MINING | FORKS,Lane Rettig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/07/28/why-ethereum-ditching-mining-isnt-as-green-as-advertised,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/28cb59178b8dbee71616aad1d72f7534dc8dbedb-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Call For Equal Treatment Joseph A. Hall from the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, representing Grayscale Investments, has penned a letter directly addressing the SEC Secretary Vanessa Countryman. In the letter, Mr. Hall, who is acting as spokesperson for the investment firm, has expressed concerns about the SEC's differential treatment towards commodity-based exchange-traded products (ETPs) that hold Bitcoin while requesting the regulatory body to reconsider its stance on spot Bitcoin ETPs. In June 2022, the SEC disapproved a proposed rule change by NYSE Arca to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. Grayscale has since sought a review of the SEC's decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Call For Investor Protection Grayscale had discussed the viability of surveillance-sharing agreements with the SEC in 2019. The company contends that the SEC already possesses the means to approve spot Bitcoin ETPs based on its previously articulated standard. (Spot Bitcoin ETPs and Bitcoin futures ETPs are the two categories of commodity-based ETPs designed to hold Bitcoin. The former holds actual Bitcoin, while the latter involves Bitcoin futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.) Although the SEC has approved Rule 19b-4 filings for Bitcoin futures ETPs, it has not done the same for spot Bitcoin ETPs. The former is attributed to their surveillance-sharing agreements with the CME. An excerpt from the letter reads, “An approval that promotes investor protection and fairness for issuers should therefore be made simultaneously with approval of all proposed spot bitcoin ETPs, including those such as the Trust whose Rule 19b-4 filings were previously disapproved after lengthy Commission consideration,” Grayscale-SEC Legal Saga Grayscale argues that approving only specific spot Bitcoin ETP proposals would grant an unfair first-mover advantage and implies discriminatory treatment. The investment firm insists that the approval process should prioritize the interests of all investors and simultaneously approve all proposed spot Bitcoin ETPs. With over $18 billion in assets, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) provides investors with exposure to the original cryptocurrency. However, the firm has encountered multiple rejections from the SEC regarding its efforts to transform its flagship Bitcoin fund into a spot Bitcoin ETF. A spot Bitcoin ETF is highly anticipated within the crypto community as it would allow institutions to gain Bitcoin exposure without the need to actually possess the digital asset. Such an ETF is considered a significant milestone in the path toward widespread Bitcoin adoption and would validate cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class.

The firm was making some serious waves when it launched its crypto fund last year in February, signaling that crypto was ready for mainstream VC backing. But now the company has reportedly downsized its cryptocurrency fund by 65% as the crypto winter rages on. Sequoia Pulls Back On Its Crypto Funding Sequoia Capital, one of Silicon Valley’s most prestigious VC firms, is scaling back its ambitions in the crypto space. After launching a dedicated $585 million crypto fund last year, Sequoia recently announced they’re slashing it by 65% to $200 million. Related Reading: European Central Bank Follows US Fed’s Footsteps With 25 BPS Hike The firm has also reduced its ecosystem fund by 50%. The fund, which invests in other smaller venture funds and solo investors, is now at $450 million, down from $900 million. Insiders close to the situation said this is a result of the bear market, which has affected projects across the industry and pulled down prices significantly over the last year. Why Is Sequoia Taking This Step Now? Sequoia is known for making investments in crypto companies and had initially announced its funds as part of a larger restructuring effort to increase its investments in the crypto space. The crypto market, however, has seen most projects take a big hit over the last few months and Sequoia wasn’t left out, as it has seen a major part of its investment take drastic losses. The company was particularly affected by the crash of FTX, as it had a $214 million investment in the failed crypto exchange. Rather than spray and pray with a large fund, Sequoia is now tightening its focus. Total market cap at $1.14 trillion as VC investments slow down | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com According to the report, the company’s new investment plan is to pivot toward smaller crypto players. The smaller cryptocurrency fund will now focus more on a select group of startup companies. With the crypto market taking a major downturn since the announcement of its funds, it’s no surprise that Sequoia has decided to scale back. Crypto projects, in particular, haven’t done well in recent times. Related Reading: DeFi Protocol Sparks Speculation Of $16 Million Rug Pull After Severing Lines of Communication According to a recent report by Lattice, a crypto venture fund, only 5% of projects created during the 2021 crypto boom have been able to create Product-to-Market Fit (PMF).

While it shows a lack of faith and reflects the growing trend among venture capital firms, the pullback doesn’t mean Sequoia is abandoning the space altogether. The venture capital firm began its crypto journey in 2014 and has a history of backing innovative technologies early on.

42392899,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCyVH,1690552734,"Amid Sanctions, Bitcoin Mining Machines Are ‘Flowing’ Into Russia, as Industry Thrives","The bitcoin mining industry in Russia is booming, and hardware manufacturers Bitmain and MicroBT are positioning themselves to reap the benefits.  More machines are flowing into Russia than anywhere else in the world, Ethan Vera, chief operating officer at global mining services firm Luxor Technologies, said at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2023 festival held last month in Austin, Texas.  Russia has always been a powerhouse in terms of Bitcoin hash rate – a measure of computational power being contributed to the blockchain – thanks to the availability of cheap energy and its cold climate. Russia’s share of world mining gained as China banned the industry in 2021, making it the second- or third-largest in the world, according to one of its biggest mining firms.  This story is part of CoinDesk's 2023 Mining Week, sponsored by Foundry.  All of this stands out as Russia’s economy has suffered amid the international sanctions imposed following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine and continued attack on the country.  None of the “sanctions targeting Russia completely prohibit involvement in the mining sector,” said David Carlisle, vice president of policy and regulation at Elliptic, a blockchain analytics firm. Still, there are “significant risks” for firms operating in Russia’s mining sector: they can’t do business with sanctioned entities including mining hosting firm BitRiver, or make payments to state banks and companies, Carlisle added.  Carlisle is a former staffer at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, including in the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which develops financial and economic sanctions.  Read more: Bitcoin Miners Are Starting to Emerge From Brutal Crypto Winter  Moreover, foreign firms setting up in Russia given the current geopolitical backdrop might be facing reputational risks.  In recent months, improved mining economics, thanks to this year’s rising price of bitcoin (BTC) and the Ordinals project that drove up activity on the Bitcoin blockchain, have created good conditions for mining in Russia, explained Sergey Arestov, CEO of miner BitCluster.  On top of that, increased regulatory scrutiny and taxation in the U.S. and elsewhere have made Russia even more competitive. Given these factors, it will be the only country able to substantially accelerate hashrate growth, mining firm Cryptocurrency Mining Group (CMG) wrote in a report.  Regulatory changes in neighboring Kazakhstan – which cap the electricity available for bitcoin mining – might have also contributed to Russia’s surge in computing power as miners moved away from Kazakhstan a while ago. Russia might be one of the destinations, said Didar Bekbau, a founder of Kazakhstan-based mining firm xive.io.  Read more: Kazakhstan's President Signs Legislation to Limit Energy Usage of Crypto Mining  Cheap energy costs, one of the largest contributors to mining profitability, have also incentivized miners in Russia to ramp up their operations. Currently miners are able to install their machines at other firms’ facilities at a cost of $0.05-$0.055 per kilowatt hour (kWh) of energy all-in, thanks to the abundance of cheap energy, so the region will likely continue developing. Prices in the U.S. are around $0.08 per kWh.  Hosting is a service that data centers provide to crypto miners in which customers can store their crypto mining rigs and mine their preferred digital assets for a fee, without having to build the accompanying infrastructure themselves.  Rig makers’ role  Such lucrative economics have incentivized manufacturers of the mining computers to cash in on the opportunity in the country.  Although the details of how rig manufacturers operate in the country are murky, industry sources that CoinDesk spoke to agree that they do have a vivid presence. These people requested anonymity because they were speaking on a sensitive topic.  Both Bitmain and MicroBT declined multiple requests for comment on this story.  MicroBT is already entrenched in the market, whereas Bitmain is trying to find intermediaries so that it can better serve the market, an industry source in the region said.  Another person said that Bitmain, the world’s largest machine maker, still sells into the Russian market, just through different company names.  Bitmain lists a Moscow office on its website. The firm advertised a meet-up in Russia (CoinDesk was not able to determine which city) on April 28 and was present at a Crypto Summit in Moscow organized in the same month, said another source in the mining industry. Bitmain took down the webpage advertising the meet-up on April 28, but CoinDesk was able to screenshot a message from an admin account in its official Telegram group chat about the event.  A reseller of mining machines contacted by CoinDesk said that both firms offer after-sales services for maintenance and repairs to Russian miners, indicating that they have a presence in the country.  Meanwhile, on MicroBT’s official Telegram group chat, several miners asked about after-sales service in Russia and the admin responded by asking questions, later inviting the miners to message them directly. CoinDesk couldn’t find similar messages on Bitmain group chats.  The fact that the rig makers are still active in Russia, while not illegal under Ukraine-related sanctions, might invite unwelcome scrutiny from authorities in the U.S., where both firms have ramped up operations in recent years as the industry has grown in North America. MicroBT opened a factory in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania U.S., the firm told CoinDesk in a previous interview, and started a pilot project with a local firm for heat reuse systems.  Ambivalent sanctions outcome  Geopolitical tensions haven’t deterred Russian miners, nor their overseas clients.  Russian entities and individuals have been heavily sanctioned following President Vladimir Putin’s attack on Ukraine. China, where both MicroBT and Bitmain are headquartered, hasn’t followed the U.S. and European Union sanctions.  BitRiver, a Russian entity and the largest hosting provider in Russia, became the first mining entity to be sanctioned by the U.S. government shortly after the invasion, leaving companies like retail-focused Compass Mining scrambling to figure out what to do with their machines. Doing business with the sanctioned entity would be a big risk to any company.  Read more: Sanctioned Bitcoin Mining Firm BitRiver Loses Another Client as SBI Leaves: Sources  European and U.S. companies were largely unphased by the sanctions and continued operating in Russia, CoinDesk has previously reported.  Despite pressure on banking, sanctions may have in fact boosted the Russian mining industry in two ways, wrote CMG in its report.  Firstly, mining offers an alternative revenue stream for power producers who have been hit by the economic downturn. Secondly, it facilitates the conversion of Russian rubles to bitcoin, which can be exchanged globally, unlike Russia’s fiat currency.

One of these voices is billionaire investor Mike Novogratz, who has yet again reiterated his support for the top cryptocurrency despite the unsettling dynamics in the United States economy. The Growing Concern: Skyrocketing Interest Payments The US is currently experiencing an unprecedented increase in debts as its interest payments reach $970 billion. This figure represents a leap of $41 billion in the second quarter alone. Observers anticipate that the rising trajectory could soon see the country’s debts surge resulting in the interest payments hitting the $1 trillion milestone, which has set off alarm bells in financial circles. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retreat Below $30,000: A Threat To Crypto’s 2023 Dominance Over Stocks? To clarify, interest payments are the actual payments that the borrower makes to the lender, typically on a regular schedule, to repay the interest on a loan or debt. The amount of each payment is determined by the interest rate and the terms of the loan. As such, the sustained upsurge of interest payments in the US economy has triggered growing unease among financial experts. Tax receipts are currently failing to keep pace with the ballooning sovereign debt. Consequently, the issuance of more debt to fund interest payments is becoming an increasingly common occurrence. This scenario has created a vicious cycle, causing concern about the potential repercussions on the nation’s fiscal health. In light of this, Mike Novogratz has once again expressed his firm support for Bitcoin. His latest advocacy came to the forefront recently when he urged investors to buy Bitcoin as the US national debt spiked by $1 trillion between June and July. Buy $BTC!!! https://t.co/UyGNaGXzyI — Mike Novogratz (@novogratz) July 27, 2023 Novogratz’s Stance: Bitcoin As A Safe Haven Despite expressing caution regarding the broader economy, Novogratz holds a sanguine view of Bitcoin’s prospects. He envisions that the cryptocurrency is on the cusp of another growth cycle, following a consolidation phase oscillating between the $28,000 to $32,000 range. However, Novogratz maintains that a significant shift in policy by the Federal Reserve, specifically a reduction in interest rates, is key for this expected surge to come to fruition. Related Reading: Galaxy Digital Founder Anticipates BTC Price Surge Due To This Reason Meanwhile, recent indicators suggest that the central bank may have different intentions. The Federal Reserve’s current stance seems to diverge from the conditions that Novogratz believes are necessary for a Bitcoin rally. Despite this, the experienced investor continues to champion Bitcoin, viewing it as a potential safe haven amid economic uncertainties. In the meantime, Bitcoin’s valuation is still persistently working to rise above the recent downward trend. The digital asset experienced a slight dip of 1% in the last day and now has a market cap of $567.5 billion. BTC’s market price currently stands at $29,309, at the time of writing.

42392888,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCxvN,1690549200,Yuga Labs Hopes to Rile Up Its Bored Apes With Latest Otherside Demo,"Bored Ape Yacht Club's parent company, Yuga Labs, has been focused on building out its Otherside gamified metaverse world for the last year, raking in millions from its Otherdeed NFTs.  The company hosted a live in-person demo of its Otherside expansion tailored to Bored Ape holders, soliciting live feedback from members of its original community.  Web3 mega-company Yuga Labs has been laser-focused on building out its Otherside metaverse since it first teased the project last year. Despite a shaky mint that clogged up Ethereum and sent gas prices soaring, the 55,000-edition collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) linked to land in the virtual world called ""Otherdeeds"" has done over 609,073 ETH (about $1.1 billion) in trading volume since its April 2022 launch.  Yuga Labs co-founder Wylie Aronow, who has since stepped back from the project, told me last year that the company is all-in on developing its gamified virtual world, which is meant to sit at the ""intersection"" of all of its NFT brands, like Bored Ape Yacht Club, CryptoPunks, Meebits and 10KTF. The company has recently brought on a number of game-focused executives to help lead its expansion, notably new CEO Daniel Alegre, formerly of Activision Blizzard, chief gaming officer Spencer Tucker and chief creative officer Michael Figge.  Holders of Otherdeed NFTs have eagerly awaited the game's release, participating in live virtual demos called ""Trips"" that have welcomed thousands of players (called ""voyagers"") at a time. During these Trips, voyagers can speak to each other and engage in team-based tasks with an ensemble of popular influencers and streamers (Snoop Dogg’s son and NFT collector Cordell Broadus led one team during the most recent event in March). But as the NFT market continues to struggle amid an extended bear market, and as interest in Yuga Lab's flagship NFT brand Bored Ape Yacht Club has sunk among formerly fervent collectors, Otherdeed holders are growing ever anxious about the game's success.  Yuga Labs is aware of these concerns and understands the importance of Otherside to its continued growth. Earlier this month, CEO Daniel Alegre told Axios that the company plans to offer more ""short-term experiences"" before Otherside is ready to be fully launched as an immersive, buildable virtual world in order to ensure that people don't ""still feel uncertain"" about its progress in a year's time.  Soliciting live feedback  On Thursday, Yuga Labs brought its Otherside demos IRL, inviting 40 voyagers to a soundstage in Los Angeles to show off an expansive new space inside its metaverse. Tailored specifically toward Bored Ape holders, the event featured refreshments and products from community members that utilized their NFT character's intellectual property (IP) in their businesses.  Though not an official Trip, during the demo, the selected Ape holders traversed a massive island created for the experience – called a ""tier 5"" island for its huge size – and were able to provide Yuga Labs with crucial feedback in real time.  Figge told CoinDesk that the roughly 2.4 square kilometers of digital island was designed to act as a virtual clubhouse for the Bored Ape community and showcase Otherside's potential use cases for other communities looking to converge in Web3.  In contrast to the Otherside Trips, which are major technical and artistic endeavors that allow thousands of users from across the world to participate in highly-curated experiences, this in-person live demo was stripped of a lot of the theatrical features in order to bring focus to the experience.  ""The only way we get feedback about these experiences afterward is we look on the internet,"" he explained. ""We look on Twitter. And it's not necessarily the best datasets that can make the site better.""  In addition, the 40 voyagers were able to participate as their Bored Ape avatars, a step forward in the game's goal of being personalized and interoperable for players.  Richard Porfirio, who goes by the alias Richpor online, participated in the live demo with his nautical-themed Ape and got a glimpse at how NFT characters will soon be able to meander around the space. ""It was nice to kind of just wander off on our own with no objective necessarily in mind,"" he told CoinDesk.  Based on his assessment, Porfirio envisions Otherside as a multipurpose hub for millions of Web3 users.  ""I could see all types of things, like Twitter Spaces being held there and live events, observations, where we can go watch sporting events or go to weddings together and have these digital experiences,"" he said, adding that he hopes the platform integrates its own marketplace for trading collectibles. ""I think that Otherside has a really great opportunity to bring these things to the masses at a level that's not really there yet.""  While Otherside still has no official public release date, Figge told CoinDesk that the team is eager to offer a persistent space for holders ""as soon as possible."" For now, the game has an ""11-part Obelisk rollout"" that is part of its larger Otherside lore.  ""We want to make sure collectors are happy first and then we'll be concerned about reach,"" he said. ""If we start projecting too far ahead, we don't get this kind of feedback loop,"" he said.  Conducting small-scale tests like these help Yuga Labs fine-tune details overlooked during its larger gaming experiences and provides holders with greater transparency into the status of high-priority projects. ""We're really excited to be able to build it all in public now and show people work-in-progress versions of things.""  The latest Otherside demo was also a vote of confidence for Porfirio and the rest of the Bored Ape community, who are hungry to restore their social status created during the NFT boom.  ""I think that Apes have a critical role [in Otherside], being welcoming and kind and being able to have fun more than anything,"" he said. ""That's pretty much what we're good at.""

""CNIL has initiated investigations,"" supporting the work of Bavarian privacy regulators who have primary responsibility under EU law, the spokesperson added.  Worldcoin went live on Monday and its cheerleaders say it could spread crypto wider than bitcoin (BTC), but it has drawn the ire of privacy watchdogs in the U.K., where the Information Commissioner’s Office has warned that people must freely give consent to the processing of their personal data, and be able to withdraw it without detriment.  ""The project will continue to cooperate with governing bodies on requests for more information about its privacy and data protection practices,"" the Worldcoin Foundation said in a statement to CoindDesk. ""We are committed to working with our partners across Europe to ensure that the Worldcoin project meets regulatory requirements and provides a safe, secure, and transparent service for verified humans.""  The Bavarian data protection regulator has not responded to CoinDesk requests for further comment about the nature of its investigation. Reuters reported on the probe earlier.

This strategic move is expected to further boost liquidity, accessibility, and the overall value and utility of the BGB token. Traders can now engage in seamless BGB/USDT trading on MEXC, accessing a broader range of opportunities and privileges. With a circulating supply of 1,400,000,000 BGB and a total supply of 2,000,000,000, BGB plays a pivotal role in Bitget's ecosystem. The token offers users exclusive privileges and a variety of rights on the Bitget exchange, encompassing fee discounts, access to high-quality tokens through Launchpad and Launchpool participation, the ability to Super Airdrop, and much more. The decision to list BGB on MEXC came along with the surging demand for the token in the market, where it has already amassed over 300,000 holders and achieved a total trading volume of more than two billion USD since the beginning of the year. BGB experienced significant price growth, reaching an all-time high of over 0.51 USDT in February and was the best-performing exchange token in H1 2023, outpacing BTC. This remarkable surge in BGB’s value can be attributed to Bitget’s successful and steady growth. With a rising share in both the spot and derivatives trading markets and a reputation for high financial security, Bitget has garnered significant traction. Additionally, Bitget's impressive track record of listing over 180 coins in 2023 and boasting the best Launchpad performance, with an ATH average ROI of 41.9x, have strengthened the use cases and attractiveness for BGB. The updated BGB whitepaper, released in April, revealed exciting new features in development, including the BGB lottery, trial fund for futures trading, and exclusive earning services. Additionally, the team is actively considering a BGB buyback and burn mechanism, aimed at reducing the token's circulating supply and bolstering its overall value. In May, Bitget introduced yet another innovative feature called ""Super Airdrop"" for its platform token, BGB. This feature offers eligible BGB holders the opportunity to receive airdrops of any new crypto assets listed on the Bitget platform. In addition to the developments of BGB functionalities, Bitget's continuous growth and influence in the cryptocurrency market also serve as key drivers for the demand and price performance of BGB. According to TokenInsight's Crypto Exchange Report Q2 2023, Bitget ranks the fourth in trading volume among all CEXs, and its market share increased by 1.81% to 8.7%, the second-highest increase among the Top5 CEXs. Bitget experienced a significant increase in market share in both the spot market and open interest, solidifying its position as a leading player in the industry. Gracy Chen, Managing Director of Bitget, commented on the listing: ""The listing of BGB on MEXC is a testament to the recognition and achievements of Bitget in the dynamic crypto space. As we continue to expand our ecosystem in both the CeFi and DeFi realms, enhancing BGB's visibility and utility remains one of our top priorities. We are excited to unlock new possibilities and reach a broader audience through this strategic collaboration with MEXC."" BGB is now available for public exchange and trade on MEXC, along with Bitfinex and Bitget, with a total daily trading volume of $10 million.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) should approve all spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications simultaneously to grant equal treatment to all applicants, Grayscale Investments said in a statement to the agency on Thursday. An approval of only the listed proposals – which include, Ark 21 Shares, Invesco Galaxy, iShares (BlackRock), Valkyrie, VanEck, WisdomTree and Wise Origin (Fidelity) – would reflect a positive “but sudden and significant change in the Commission’s application of the relevant statutory standard, and as such would improperly grant an unfairly discriminatory and prejudicial first-mover advantage to these proposals,” read the statement. Grayscale remains locked in a months-long legal battle with the SEC to have its own application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF.  Bitcoin (BTC) held above $29,000 early Friday while Japanese and U.S. government bond yields rose after the Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced a slight hawkish tweak to its liquidity-boosting bond-buying program known as yield curve control (YCC). The central bank retained its short-term interest rate target at 0.1% and the 10-year government bond yield target around 0%. The BOJ, however, said that its previous 0.5% band for the 10-year bond would be a reference and not a hard cap, promising more flexibility in its yield curve control policy. The yield on the 10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) is higher by 11 basis points to 0.55%.  Bitcoin could reach $300,000 by 2028, said Mark Yusko, Morgan Creek Capital Management founder and CEO, on CoinDesk TV’s First Mover. Yusko made the prediction while comparing bitcoin to gold. Gold is not portable or divisible, whereas bitcoin is, the CEO of the $1.6 billion asset management firm explained. ""Bitcoin fixes both of these issues, and is equally scarce,"" Yusko added, arguing that the digital asset could eventually catch up to the precious metal’s valuation. “The monetary value of gold is about $6 trillion, I think bitcoin can replace all of that, the monetary equivalent of $6 trillion is about a 10X from here, which gives us a price of about $300K,” said Yusko.

She believes that Bitcoin’s stability and a huge rally in the wake of US regional banks collapsing is a major testament to the fact that Bitcoin is the future of money. Cathie Wood Remains Bullish On Bitcoin In a recent interview with Barron’s, Wood maintained that she remains bullish on digital assets and highlighted three reasons she won’t be backing down on her investments. According to her, Bitcoin stood tall and rose by 60%, from $19,000 to $30,000, when regional banks like First Republic, SVB, and Signature Bank collapsed. She attributed this run to investors seeing the asset as a safe alternative for storing their wealth. Related Reading: European Central Bank Follows US Fed’s Footsteps With 25 BPS Hike Wood explained: We see three revolutions taking place because of crypto. Bitcoin will dominate the first one, the money revolution. The biggest proof is that when regional-bank stocks were falling apart earlier this year, Bitcoin went from $19,000 to $30,000. That was a flight to safety, and we expect it to accelerate. The centralized monetary system we have today is an aberration. We could be going back to the future – before the Federal Reserve existed – under a digital, rules-based monetary system with no government oversight. The other reasons for her bullishness on digital assets relate to decentralized finance (DeFi) and digital property rights involving tokenizing several physical assets in real estate and other relevant industries. “The second revolution is in financial services, or the so-called DeFi, which will be Ethereum-based. There are a number of infrastructure providers out there. It’s the survival of the fittest, and I’m excited to see who wins,” the CEO said. Last but not least, according to Woord, “is digital property rights, or what many call NFT or the metaverse. People are already buying real estate in virtual worlds. Our young research associates come into the office wearing jeans and T-shirts with no logos, but they are getting their status in the virtual world.” BTC bulls struggle to keep bears at bay | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Weighing In On Coinbase’s Battle With SEC During the interview, Cathie Wood also discussed Coinbase’s ongoing battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Wood’s ARK holdings are one of the largest holders of Coinbase’s stock. She believes that the crypto exchange will ultimately get victory in the SEC’s lawsuit against it for the sale of unregistered securities. According to her, the court will rule that the SEC has gone beyond its regulatory purview, and in the long run, the US Congress will pass crypto-friendly bills. “Meanwhile, the legislative branch has awakened to the fact that crypto is a new asset class and we might need new legislatures to give the regulators some guidance,” the ARK Invest CEO added. Related Reading: Lacoste Unveils Exclusive Ethereum-Based Virtual Store For NFT Holders “Those two branches of government have given us great confidence that Coinbase will come out of this as a winner. Many Coinbase competitors either haven’t entered the US or moved out because of our regulatory system. Coinbase has stayed to fight.

U.S. Senate Takes a Stand on Crypto On Thursday, the U.S. Senate made a significant move by passing the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a $886 billion military spending bill that contains a provision that will significantly affect the crypto industry. Spearheaded by senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Cynthia Lummis, Elizabeth Warren, and Roger Marshall, the amendment aims to tighten oversight of financial institutions involved in crypto trading and clamp down on the use of crypto mixers and ""anonymity-enhancing"" assets. The senators hailed it as a substantial step in regulating crypto assets. Merging Existing Acts The amendment draws from two existing acts already presented earlier to the Senate. Elements from the 2023 Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act and portions of Senator Warren’s and Senator Marshall’s Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act, introduced in 2022, have been integrated into the bill. These additions mandate the Secretary of the Treasury to establish examination standards for crypto assets, helping with risk assessment and ensuring compliance with money laundering and sanctions laws. Furthermore, the Treasury Department will be required to conduct a study on countering anonymous crypto transactions, specifically targeting the use of mixers to obscure fund origins. Customary Approach To Legislation The inclusion of crypto-related provisions in a military bill may raise eyebrows. However, the practice of adding non-defense-related amendments to military bills is not uncommon. Furthermore, the senators have defended this move by highlighting the importance of combating illicit finance within the crypto industry. Senator Lummis emphasizes that this measure is crucial for identifying and rooting out bad actors in the sector. Additionally, the bill aims to address concerns related to national security, ensuring that crypto assets are not exploited to evade sanctions or fund terrorist activities. As the House has already passed its version of the NDAA, both chambers will now enter negotiations to reconcile differences and reach a consensus on the final version of the bill. This process is essential for the legislation's passage and enactment. Broader Regulatory Initiatives In conjunction with the NDAA, other congressional committees have also taken steps to address the regulatory challenges posed by the crypto industry. The House Agriculture Committee recently advanced the Financial Innovation Technology for the 21st Century Act to establish a federal regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the United States. The House Financial Services Committee passed its version a day earlier, focusing on establishing clear criteria for classifying crypto assets as securities or commodities. As the House and Senate continue their negotiations, the outcome will determine the extent of regulatory measures imposed on the crypto sector and its impact on financial institutions and traders alike.

The move comes amidst growing suspicions of a $16 million rug pull engineered through a so-called hard rug, a process where funds are quickly moved, leaving investors with shitcoins. This comes after a controversial rage-quit vote organized by the project’s DAO. DeFi Protocol Hector Network Leaves Investors In Limbo Hector Network investors woke up to the news that the DeFi protocol had cut off communications on its official Discord server. The Discord server was the only means of communication between the network’s team and its investors which was established after the Hector Network team censored them from the official server in April. Related Reading: Lacoste Unveils Exclusive Ethereum-Based Virtual Store For NFT Holders The server was meant to run parallel to the official Discord, preserving data from the latter. Since then, it has become the only means of communication among DAO members. The move has left the network’s investors in a state of shock since they no longer have any means of communication with the network’s team. This has led to a lot of backlash, and according to Libagscientist, an investor and vocal critic of the platform, “there is no backchannel open anymore.” In the absence of any official communication, dejected investors are accusing the network of siphoning the $16 million left in its treasury. According to investors, the team embezzled the project’s funds over an 18-month period starting in 2021. According to records of DAO votes, the Hector team received over $51 million in salaries during this period without delivering on any meaningful milestone. An aggrieved investor identified as Jintu said, “..not one thing has actually moved forwards.” A Story of Sheer Incompetence and Greed The Hector Network is part of several Olympus DAO forks, a prominent cryptocurrency reserve currency project that peaked during the DeFi summer of 2021. The Hector Network, like other Olympus DAO forks, promised huge annualized yields of about 100,000% in the beginning, and the early successes of Olympus DAO attracted many investors hunting for massive returns. During its hay days, Hector Network’s native token, HEC reached $357 in late 2021. However, the platform’s challenge lies in the fact that its inflationary yield needs to be supported with a steady influx of investor cash to keep the HEC token valuable and maintain its high yields. Related Reading: European Central Bank Follows US Fed’s Footsteps With 25 BPS Hike Following the crypto winter that began in November 2021, the platform has been unable to recover. Aggrieved investors believe that the team should have applied the funds held in its treasury toward developing value for token holders. Many have now accused the team of being greedy and unconcerned about meeting the targets of the network and the current saga might eventually end up in the courts. However, investors’ top priority remains to recoup their funds. Hector Network has declined requests for comments but has unequivocally rejected the allegations in a statement released on June 14.

Yes it is true the United States also makes money by printing money. That benefit goes to the American people when we provide services, or when we tax them less, and the attempt of the billionaire bros in crypto is to appropriate for themselves that literal money-making machine. Congressman Sherman is talking here of the “privilege” that the US government has to print money out of thin air, and he is saying that this money out of thin air is for better services and lower taxes for the people. He was not asked what the better services were or when and by how much taxes were lowered for the American people. The congressman has accused ‘crypto bros’ in the past of the same thing, saying that they have printed more than $1 trillion from thin air, adding: They’ll accuse the US government of making money out of thin air - maybe we do - we’re the US government.” Sherman had a lot more to say about crypto in general, and he singled out Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, for special treatment. “We are told that cryptocurrency is very innovative. Look at the incredible financial innovation of Enron and WorldCom, and reflect on the fact that I don’t believe that Saratoshi Nagamoto was innovative.” The fact that the congressman couldn’t even get the Bitcoin creator’s name right says much about him not doing any investigation at all into the history of this technology. Also, to pick on Bitcoin, the first technology to solve the double spend problem and possibly the most innovative technology of a generation, rather than a crypto scam coin, does not bode well for his chances of successfully arguing any proposed anti-crypto legislation. Brad Sherman is a relic of the past. He has a biassed view which does not take the other side into account. He has obviously carried out no investigation into a technology that has been described as extremely innovative, even by leaders of global financial bodies and heads of global financial companies. It is hoped that Sherman and others like him in Congress will be brought to their senses soon, not to pass laws for crypto scammers to be able to make hay at the expense of investors, but to put together thoughtful and constructive laws that will encourage innovation at the same time as protecting those who would use this technology or invest in it.

15380206,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544814,1690537556,Ethereum Price Will Skyrocket Due To AI-Driven DAO Revolution: Arthur Hayes,"In a thought-provoking blog post titled “Moai,” Arthur Hayes, co-founder of the renowned crypto exchange BitMEX, delves into the potential impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the future of economic organization and the role of Ethereum. Hayes argues that the rise of AI-driven Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) will revolutionize the global economy and propel Ethereum to new heights. The Critical Role Of DAOs In The AI Era Hayes contends that the current economic progress and per capita wealth of global civilization can be attributed to the efficient self-organization of human societies. He emphasizes that traditional company structures, empowered and regulated by the state, have been the primary vehicles for economic development. However, he highlights the limitations of these structures when it comes to AI-driven entities. He states, “An AI has no reason to follow any laws. It cannot be coerced by the state, and therefore, exchanges that trade tokens issued by AI-powered DAOs will likely become natural monopolies.” Related Reading: Lacoste Unveils Exclusive Ethereum-Based Virtual Store For NFT Holders Hayes lays out a compelling argument for why DAOs, relying on smart contracts executed on public blockchains like Ethereum, are the ideal organizational structure for AI-driven entities. These smart contracts provide transparency, immutability, and cryptographic verification of transactions and agreements. Consequently, DAOs can operate efficiently and securely without the need for third-party intermediaries or costly auditing processes. He envisions a future where AI-powered DAOs will raise capital and trade their tokens on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Ethereum rather than traditional centralized exchanges. This will create truly global capital markets accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Hayes predicts that DEXs will become natural monopolies due to the advantages they offer in terms of trust, security, and ease of use. The BitMEX founder presents a hypothetical example of “PoetAI,” an AI-powered DAO that aims to fundraise and produce original poetry for profit. He envisions how PoetAI could issue its tokens, called “POET,” through a smart contract with specific attributes, such as revenue sharing and voting mechanisms. Investors can confidently invest in PoetAI DAO knowing that its financial statements are continuously available on the public blockchain, eliminating the need for traditional auditors. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Could Avoid More Downsides If It Closes Above One Key Level Moreover, Hayes explains that DAOs can raise capital by issuing debt, enabling economic time travel by borrowing from the future to stimulate present economic activity. The enforceability of contracts in DAOs can be facilitated through smart contracts on public blockchains, ensuring that investors are protected. Hayes’ Bull Case For Ethereum Hayes concludes, “Ethereum transactions will grow exponentially as DAOs proliferate. As a result, the price of ETH should skyrocket in anticipation if this AI DAO hypothesis is widely believed.” He also suggests that identifying and investing in Ethereum based governance tokens of DEXs facilitating AI-driven DAO trading will lead to significant profits. Furthermore, Ethereum middleware layers that enable visualization of AI DAO accounts will become essential for the smooth functioning of these capital markets. While these ideas represent bold predictions about the future of AI and the role of Ethereum, Hayes presents a compelling case for the potential disruptive power of AI-driven DAOs. Hayes is one of the great thinkers of crypto space and his thesis a narrative to watch. At press time, the Ether (ETH) price was at $1,863, just below the mid-range resistance.

The redemption is the result of a highly contentious vote that returns a portion of Parrot Finance’s treasury to token holders. A Controversial Vote Two years ago, Parrot Finance had raised over $80 million during the public token sale of its PRT tokens. Cut to 2023, and the DeFi protocol is holding a controversial vote to buy its investors out. The proposal in question calls for the end of Parrot’s governance token through a redemption program which will see $50 million from its treasury be divided among PRT token holders, priced at $0.0045 each. If passed, the vote would be catastrophic to Parrot’s earliest investors, who shared the protocol’s vision of building a powerful stablecoin and lending market. Early investors would end up recouping only one-tenth of their initial investment, despite the fact that Parrot’s treasury would retain around $73 million. The proposal has angered investors who argue that the DeFi protocol’s team could walk away with millions of dollars, despite never following up on their promise of giving PRT token holders more control over the protocol and often being absent from the protocol entirely. According to early investors, the Parrot team had promised them a protocol that they would be able to govern. Instead, they are being asked to leave for pennies on the dollar. Going Ahead With Token Buyback According to multiple posts on its Discord server, Parrot Finance is moving ahead with its plan to purchase its PRT tokens from sellers at a price of $0.0045 each. The purchase will be carried out through a stablecoin market set up on the OpenBook decentralized exchange. According to the company, the redemption period will last for eight weeks, concluding with the sunsetting of the PRT token. The greenlighting of the plan comes after the results of a community vote to return a chunk of the DeFi protocol’s treasury to token holders came out. The vote passed with 99% voting in favor but faced significant backlash from smaller investors who accused the Parrot team of keeping a major chunk of the treasury for themselves. According to pseudo-anonymous on-chain sleuth Ashpool, the vote was a premeditated sham, pointing to the “dress rehearsal” vote, which was held a week prior to the final proposal. According to a thread by crypto reporter Danny Nelson, the Parrot team, along with activist investors, are likely to make millions in future payroll, a huge share of the treasury, and complete ownership of the protocol. “gopartyparrot raised nearly $90 million during the height of Solana’s 2021 bull market. But its plans to build new kinds of crypto lending markets never caught fire. After nearly a year of pressure from activist investors, the protocol held a contentious vote to buy out all PRT holders. The now-passed plan earmarks just a slice of Parrot’s remaining treasury for normal investors.” Original Investors Obliterated Nelson called the Parrot team the real winners of the exercise, stating, “Parrot’s developer team walks away with millions of dollars in future payroll runway and a massive share of the treasury, not to mention full ownership of the protocol. They’re almost certainly the big winners here. Activist investors will also likely make a bundle. Some of them have likely been buying the token for months at prices well below the buyback rate in preparation for the redemption program.” Nelson stated that the original investors in the project would be obliterated. As things stand, the original investors in Parrot and its PRT token can expect to recover only about a tenth of their actual investments. “But the original retail investors in Parrot are getting absolutely obliterated. Anyone who bought Parrot’s IDO and stuck it out to the end will recoup around 1/10 of their capital.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42392886,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCxfz,1690534587,"Bitcoin Bulls Should Switch to Call Options, Crypto Services Provider Matrixport Says","Matrixport says low volatility makes switching to bullish call options a viable strategy to optimize returns.  Options look cheap as bitcoin's key volatility gauges have fallen to multi-year lows.  Crypto traders should consider rotating money out of bitcoin (BTC) and into bullish call options tied to the cryptocurrency to optimize their returns, crypto services provider Matrixport said on Thursday.  ""Predictably, the crypto market has become very quiet during these summer weeks. This has caused trading volumes and volatility to fall markedly. Investors might be well advised to replace their bitcoin spot with Bitcoin options, notably upside calls, as lower volatility has made option prices cheaper,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto service provider Matrixport, said.  ""This allows locking in the year-to-date gains for bitcoin, while the call option exposure allows participating in any upside rally,"" Thielen added.  Matrixport was one of the few firms that have been consistently bullish on bitcoin since late 2022. The leading cryptocurrency has rallied nearly 77% this year, with the bullish move running out of steam above $30,000 in recent weeks.  Call options give traders the right, though not the obligation, to buy bitcoin at a stated price by a specific date. Put options grant the right to sell. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market, while a put buyer is bearish. Options prices are influenced by the option's strike, time to expiration, interest rates, and implied volatility – expectations for price turbulence over a specific period.  Low volatility play  Volatility is mean-reverting, it will make asset prices come closed to the mean prices, and has a positive impact on option prices. Hence, options are said to be cheap and traders prefer buying options when volatility is unusually low and prefer selling options when volatility is exceptionally high.  Bitcoin's 30-day realized, or historical volatility, has declined to an annualized 28%, the lowest since January. T3I's BitVol Index, which gauges expected price turbulence in the crypto over four weeks, recently dipped to 40.47, the lowest reading since at least early 2019. The present situation is in stark contrast to late 2022 when volatility was too high and options looked pricier.  More importantly, this year, a positive correlation has developed between implied volatility and bitcoin's price. So, if bitcoin's rally resumes, call options holders will likely make outsized gains on a smaller initial investment.  Thielen's note to clients suggests pocketing in bitcoin's YTD gain of 77% and using the freed-up capital to buy an at-the-money (ATM) call option with a notional value of 3% every month. This way, even if the market drops, investors would still end the year with a 62% net gain.  Buying a call lets you control the same amount of shares as buying the underlying asset with significantly less money. A call buyer pays a premium to the seller for offering protection against bullish moves. The premium paid is the maximum amount the call buyer can lose if the market drops. An at-the-money call is the one whose strike price is closer to the going market rate of the underlying security. For instance, calls at strikes around bitcoin's current market price of $29,180 are at-the-money.  ""This 'Bitcoin replacement strategy’ would guarantee continuous exposure to the upside opportunity of Bitcoin through buying a Bitcoin call every month for 3% notional exposure (5*3% = 15%) while locking in this year’s gains of +77% (minus 15% for the calls), which leads to a net gain of ~62% even if Bitcoin prices retrace from here and each call loses money,"" Thielen explained.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/28/bitcoin-bulls-should-switch-to-call-options-crypto-services-provider-matrixport-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aaa0b6f9db13346bbb09314420c3d7715d8dcffd-1717x982.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The layer 2 network will utilize bone, treat, shib and leash tokens for applications built on the blockchain, which could lift the prices of these tokens as demand increases.  A bridge between the soon-to-be launched Shiba Inu-based layer 2 blockchain Shibarium and Ethereum is live for public testing, allowing users to transfer tokens between the two networks, developers said early Friday.  The bridge will initially let users transfer testnet ether tokens to Shibarium, which is due to start operations next month, according to chief developer Shytoshi Kusama. Each transfer is expected to take a maximum of up to 30 minutes and, as of Friday, real assets were not supported.  ""Layer 2"" refers to a set of off-chain systems – separate blockchains – built on top of layer 1 protocols, reducing bottlenecks with scaling and data. They bundle multiple off-chain transactions into a single layer 1 transaction, which helps reduce the data load and fees.  DoggyDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) run and governed by token holders, will also start operations when Shibarium goes live and will be used to fund projects building on the blockchain.  The testnet has seen meaningful activity in the past months with 27 million transactions from an estimated 16 million wallets as of July, indicating brisk demand for the network.  Developers have previously said Shibarium would have a focus on metaverse and gaming applications especially as the non-fungible token (NFT) sector is expected to heat up in the coming years.",POSITIVE,SHIB,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SHIB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/07/28/shibarium-blockchains-ethereum-bridge-goes-live-for-testing-as-shib-tries-to-shed-meme-coin-tag,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dab71bfef45186147795dd2f2857a537f44e3406-1885x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Revenues and users for Unibot have surged in the past month, according to Dune Analytics.  It’s not a bear market in some crypto circles.  Early holders of the Telegram-based exchange Unibot (UNIBOT) are sitting on nearly 200 times their initial capital as the niche sector token quickly gained favor among investors.  The Unibot platform connects user wallets to the decentralized exchange Uniswap and lets them punt on tokens just as easily as they would send messages to each other on the popular messaging app by using Telegram-based tools.  UNIBOT prices have spiked 40% in the past 24 hours - hitting the $200 level - and have more than tripled since the start of July. As of Friday, the token has a market capitalization of $180 million.  The draw is unique: Unibot, which allows sophisticated on-chain trading, pays out spot ether (ETH) to its token holders based on the revenue generated on the platform.  On-chain data shows Unibot has garnered 3,600 ether in fees since the platform went live in May, paying out a portion of this straight to token holders. Users have also steadily increased – touching 6,500 on Thursday compared to just over 2,000 at the end of June.  Average daily volumes on Unibot stand at just above $5.5 million, the data show, still a long draw from volumes of $900 million a day on market-leading DEX Uniswap.  The appeal for such products is likely due to the ease of usage compared to a decentralized exchange, such as Uniswap, where users have to continually log in to their wallet, cross-check if all token information is correct, and encounter high fees to ensure their trades go through.  Such a conflux of utility and fee-sharing is likely to amp up demand for UNIBOT tokens in the future, especially during bullish conditions when traders are likely to search for projects that offer passive payouts.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/07/28/early-unibot-investors-sit-on-200x-gains-as-unibot-bucks-bitcoin-lull,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/12aadf777b36dc32a0cd75e657cfee15fdcd5e22-1893x1065.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The influencer had been reported missing since the 18th of July. Murder Investigation Launched The remains of the influencer were discovered by children playing near a stream in the country of Argentina. According to the authorities, the children found a red suitcase while playing by a stream near the city of Ingeniero Budge in the Buenos Aires Province. The parents notified the relevant authorities, who, upon investigating the suitcase, discovered the missing influencer’s legs and forearm inside. They also discovered another arm floating in the stream. Later, the police also found Algaba’s head and torso. Authorities were able to establish the identity of Algaba thanks to his fingerprints and the numerous tattoos on his body. A subsequent autopsy suggested that the victim was shot at least three times before the body was cut into pieces. Furthermore, the body parts were cleanly cut, suggesting the murder was a professional hit job. An Extravagant Lifestyle According to the authorities, Algaba had accumulated millions by renting luxury vehicles and selling cryptocurrency, making sure that he advertised his extravagant lifestyle to his over 900,000 followers on Instagram. Algaba was based in Barcelona but had been staying in Argentina since a week prior to his alleged murder. He had also rented an apartment for himself and was supposed to return the keys to the landlord on the 19th of July. However, the property owner stated that he failed to show up on the scheduled date or answer any phone calls. The murder marks a tragic end for the influencer, known as Lechuga (Lettuce), to his friends. According to friends, Algaba had started working from the age of 14, selling sandwiches on his bicycle and working his way to purchasing vehicles, repairing, and then reselling them. The influencer’s hard work and dedication seemed to have paid off, as by the time he turned 24, he had a warehouse filled with high-end cars, motorcycles, and jet skis. He also founded a luxury car and jet ski rental firm in Miami before moving to Barcelona earlier in the year, and also opened a cryptocurrency trading office in Argentina, employing 25 people. Everything Not As It Seems However, the influencer’s rise to riches was not all that it was made out to be. Authorities in Argentina have already made one arrest in connection with the murder. While the motive is yet to be established, police believe that Algaba was murdered thanks to his numerous debts. According to Argentina’s tax agency, Algaba had racked up irrecoverable debts, and his company, Motors Lettuce SRL, was also in considerable debt and began bouncing cheques just a year after its 2018 opening. Algaba’s phone also had notes that revealed he had lost significant money on his crypto investments. To make matters worse, the influencer had also reportedly upset the Barra Bravas, a violent Argentinean gang that is heavily involved in the country’s burgeoning football scene. The gang had reportedly been demanding that Algaba pay them a $40,000 loan. He had already warned his friends in a message, stating that if anything happened to me, everyone is already warned. Not Involved With Criminals The deceased influencer’s brother, Rodolfo Perez Algaba, denied that his sibling was involved with or had anything to do with criminal rings. He added that he was not a scammer as many claimed and was just a simple car salesman who did not do well with his Bitcoin investments. Rodolfo also stated that their father died when he was 17 and had left him an inheritance which Algaba used to start his business empire, suggesting that the influencer’s rags-to-riches story was not as it seemed. The two brothers had not seen each other for months following an argument, with Rodolfo claiming that Algaba was under psychiatric treatment for an anxiety disorder. He also appealed to the authorities to apprehend the individuals involved in his brother’s murder, stating in an interview with local media agencies, “I’ve been here for three days and hardly sleep, thinking, breaking my head, how could this happen. But I’m not going to sit still. I’m not going to do justice with my own hands, but I hope that justice will be done.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

15376987,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544792,1690529449,Crunching The Data: Will Bitcoin Price Soar Or Slump In The Coming Days?,"The Bitcoin price is currently in an uncertain situation. After BTC broke below the one-month trading range between $29.800 and $31.500, the bulls have so far failed to recapture this area. A first attempt failed on Wednesday at $29.725, a second effort on Thursday at $29.600. On the other hand, the bears currently also fail to push the price below the critical support at $29.000. In which direction the next movement will go is, as always, pure speculation, but data can give indications. Bullish Signal 1: Decreasing BTC Supply On Exchanges Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared an intriguing bullish chart, revealing that only 2.25 million BTC are currently held in known crypto exchange wallets. This is the lowest Bitcoin supply on trading platforms since January 2018. The data suggests that investors and long-term holders are refraining from selling and are instead choosing to keep their BTC off exchanges. This “hodling” behavior indicates a positive sentiment BTC holders. Bullish Signal 2: Lack Of Inflows From Bitcoin Whales Head of Research at CryptoQuant, Julio Moreno, pointed out another bullish sign when he shared a chart showing a lack of inflows from large investors with 1,000 to 10,000 BTC (aka Bitcoin whales) into exchanges. Moreno stated, “”Not really seeing Bitcoin whale inflows into exchanges.” Additionally, the same trend is observed among smaller investors, indicating a reluctance to deposit BTC into centralized exchanges. Commenting on the exchange deposit transactions (7-day SMA) chart, Moreno added, “indeed, seems nobody wants to deposit into centralized exchanges.” Related Reading: Don’t Change The Channel! Why Bitcoin Could Target $42K If Uptrend Holds Such behavior suggests that significant holders and institutions are holding onto their BTC assets, potentially anticipating future price increases. Bearish Signal: Short-Term Holder (STH) MVRV Metric On-chain analyst Axel Adler Jr. addressed the short-term holder (STH) MVRV metric, saying: “STH MVRV is actively falling and we may see something similar to what happened in the two previous corrections.” The chart shown by Adler reveals that the STH MVRV fell either close to 0 or even below during the lows of the sharp Bitcoin price corrections in mid-March and mid-June. Currently, the STH MVRV is still somewhat elevated, so a last pullback in the Bitcoin price triggered by short term holder selling may be necessary for the MVRV to reset to 0. Adler also remarked that there isn’t a substantial Inflow to futures exchanges at the moment like there was in March and June. “Don’t expect a sharp breakthrough upwards or downwards,” added Adler. BTC Binance Spot Liquidity Analysis Analyst @52kskew shared a comprehensive analysis of BTC Binance spot liquidity, highlighting an interesting observation. The bid liquidity (bids > asks) and spot asks moved lower towards price due to low volatility. He added, “note the difference in volume leading to previous selloff & current falling volume & minimal decline.” Related Reading: Fed’s No Recession Claim Boosts Bitcoin And Crypto, Historical Data Contradicts Given the bid liquidity between $29,000 and $28,500, this area could be the point for buyers to step in if BTC experiences a pullback. In a bullish scenario, spot buying would occur in this area, followed by a rotation out of shorts. New longs get opened and price migrates towards spot supply near $30,000. In a sell off scenario, price grinds through spot bid liquidity and forced selling occurs, says Skew. Potential Impact of Economic Data On Bitcoin In addition, it is crucial to keep an eye on macroeconomic factors that could influence Bitcoin’s price. The release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) at 8:30 am EST today is of particular importance. During Wednesday’s FOMC press conference, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stressed the importance of core inflation, which is proving sticky. Therefore, the Core PCE in particular, needs to continue falling to alleviate the Fed’s inflation concerns. If the 4.2% expectation for core PCE is exceeded, a bullish reaction from Bitcoin can be expected. At press time, the Bitcoin price stood at $29,210.

The SEC did not immediately reply to CoinDesk's request for further clarification.  “Whether a company loses a factory in a fire — millions of files in a cybersecurity incident — it may be material to investors,” said SEC Chair Gary Gensler.

Judge Kaplan had earlier imposed a temporary gag order on all parties involved in the case as he considered the DOJ's request to send Bankman-Fried back to jail for the remainder of his time before the criminal trial.  FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has asked the court to seal the private diary of his sometimes girlfriend and ex-Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, while Inner City Press has opposed the move, according to court filings.  Bankman-Fried is facing the possibility of heading back to jail. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) asked Judge Lewis Kaplan of the Southern District of New York to make the FTX founder spend the remainder of his time in jail before his criminal trial begins. The DOJ had accused Bankman-Fried of leaking Ellison's private diary to The New York Times and trying to tamper with witnesses multiple times.  ""The presumption of access to these documents is greatly outweighed by the need to avoid their public dissemination at this time,"" Bankman-Fried's lawyer wrote to the court.  Judge Kaplan declined to jail Bankman-Fried immediately, but put a temporary gag order on parties and witnesses” from ""publicly disseminating or discussing with any public communications media anything about the case which could interfere with a fair trial."" Judge Kaplan also set out a rapid schedule for both the prosecution and the defense to make formal written submissions on the matter.  New York's Inner City Press, a publication that covers court proceedings in the city's federal court, was previously involved in opposing Bankman-Fried's bid to keep secret the identity of his bail co-signers, and asked the court to schedule a hearing on the matter if required.  ""Again this defendant is being treated different than other defendants in this District,"" Inner City's Matthew Russell Lee wrote to the court opposing the sealing of documents Bankman-Fried already provided to The New York Times. ""This is an application for this court to grant or if necessary schedule a hearing on this challenge to the proposed withholding of this information.""  Bankman-Fried is currently set to go on trial in October on various charges, including securities and wire fraud allegations. A second trial on additional charges, including bank fraud and bribery allegations, is scheduled for next March. He has pleaded not guilty.

Bond yields rose after the BOJ decision, offering negative cues to risk assets, including bitcoin.  BOJ's YCC has been a major source of liquidity for global markets since 2016. The move away from the liquidity-boosting policy may have global repercussions.  Bitcoin (BTC) held above $29,000 early Friday, while Japanese and U.S. government bond yields rose after the Bank of Japan (BOJ) maintained low-interest rates, but announced a slight hawkish tweak to its liquidity-boosting bond-buying program called yield curve control (YCC).  The central bank retained the short-term interest rate target at 0.1% and the YCC's 10-year government bond yield target around 0%. It also maintained its December 2022 decision to allow the 10-year yield to move 0.5% up and down each around the 0% target.  The bank, however, said that the 0.5% band would be a reference and not a hard cap, promising more flexibility in the yield curve control.  ""The BOJ retained the language around 0.5% target for 10Y JGB, but moved the hard cap to 1%, with a vague language on ""flexibility."" I think this is basically a proper YCC tweak, with semantics designed to make people think it's not as hawkish as it is,"" rates strategist Rishi Mishra tweeted.  Chris Weston, head of research at foreign-exchange brokerage Pepperstone, said the new hard cap is 1%.  The move comes days after the International Monetary Fund urged the BOJ to move away from the yield curve control to prepare for eventual interest rate hikes.  Several investment banks had anticipated a band widening to 100 basis points from 50 bps, with Goldman Sachs saying it might send out a wrong signal to the market.  Bitcoin did not see big moves following the BOJ decision and continued to trade sideways, around $29,250.  However, bond yields rose, offering negative cues to risk assets, including bitcoin. The 10-year Japanese government bond yield rose six basis points to 0.56%, reaching the highest since January. Its U.S. counterpart rose three basis points to 4.03%, extending the overnight 13 bps gain.  The BOJ relaxing its grip on the bond market at a time when the Federal Reserve and other major central banks look set to hold interest rates higher for longer might mean a challenging time for risk assets. BOJ's yield curve control – perpetual QE – has been a significant source of liquidity for the global markets since 2016.

The amendment was brought forward by a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators, comprised of Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), who said in a press release that the move represented ""one of the most substantial congressional actions to date regarding crypto assets.""  The amendment was crafted by provisions taken from the 2023 Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act and Senator Warren’s and Senator Marshall’s Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act, introduced in 2022. Specifically, it requires that the Secretary of the Treasury ""establish examination standards for crypto assets,"" which would help examiners better assess risk and ensure compliance with money laundering and sanctions laws. In addition, it requires the Treasury Department to conduct a study on ""combating anonymous crypto asset transactions,"" including the use of crypto mixers that are sometimes used to obfuscate funds.  “Cracking down on illicit finance in the crypto asset industry is essential for weeding out bad actors and ensuring crypto assets are not used to evade sanctions and fund terrorism,” said Senator Lummis in the press release.  It’s a common practice to add amendments to the bill that aren’t necessarily defense-related. The House passed its version of the NDAA, which is seen as a must-pass piece of legislation, earlier this month, and both chambers now need to negotiate on a version that can pass both chambers.  Earlier Thursday, the House Agriculture Committee advanced the Financial Innovation Technology for the 21st Century Act, which would create a federal regulatory framework for crypto in the U.S. The House Financial Services Committee passed its version of that bill on Wednesday.",NEUTRAL,없음,REGULATION | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/28/us-senate-passes-886b-military-spending-bill-with-crypto-aml-provision,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/78fa4b1d21c27e31fd860a11495efd09ff0c48b6-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Solana-based lending and stablecoin market plans to buy PRT tokens from all sellers at a price of $0.0045 apiece via a stablecoin market set up on the OpenBook decentralized exchange. This redemption period will last for eight weeks and conclude with the sunsetting of PRT, Parrot’s governance token.  The redemption program’s greenlighting is the result of a community vote to return a slice of Parrot’s treasury – valued north of $70 million – to token holders. It passed with a lopsided 99% in favor but faced backlash from small-time investors who feel Parrot’s developer team is keeping too much of the treasury for itself.  The vote ""was a premeditated sham"" that relied heavily on insider-connected wallets, said the pseudonymous Ashpool, an on-chain sleuth that focuses on the Solana ecosystem. He pointed to a seeming ""dress rehearsal"" vote the organizers held one week prior to the final proposal.  Original investors of Parrot and PRT can expect to recover about a tenth of the value they put in. Newcomers, particularly the activist investors who pressured Parrot’s leaders for a redemption program, could make many multiples, depending on when they bought in.  Parrot’s redemption program comes two years into the project’s unremarkable run on the Solana blockchain, where it has failed to catch fire despite raising an over $90 million warchest from retail and venture investors.

The filing leans heavily on the view that the CFTC is overreaching in suing Binance, which does not operate in the U.S., and its CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, who does not reside in the U.S., the filing said.

15368767,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544758,1690509636,Bullish Price Formation For Solana – Is $30 Around The Corner?,"Solana (SOL) has experienced a notable downturn recently, unable to sustain itself above the $32 mark. The altcoin remains below a strong resistance level, but a potential breakthrough could lead to a 20% price appreciation. Related Reading: PEPE Whales Load Up Their Bags As Memecoin Jumps 13% In the last 24 hours, SOL saw a modest surge of 2.2%, but its performance on the weekly chart shows minimal upward movement. Despite the challenges, there are two essential bullish signals to consider: the morning star reversal sign and a bullish pennant formation. These signals suggest that if SOL surpasses the immediate resistance, the coin might aim for a rally back to levels it reached two weeks ago. In the broader market context, Bitcoin’s re-entry into the $29,000 price level has caused retracements in altcoins on their respective charts. Therefore, for SOL to surpass the immediate resistance, it will require strong support from the broader market. The market capitalization of SOL has also experienced a decline, indicating a slight weakening in buying strength. Solana Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, SOL was valued at $24.90. The coin tried to reach the $32 level, but the bulls faced resistance and could not sustain it. Subsequently, SOL has been striving to breach the immediate resistance level at $26. A successful move above $26 could propel the coin’s value to $28. It may encounter a potential price ceiling at that level. If this level is surpassed, the coin could rally further to reach $30. On the other hand, there is a downside risk. If SOL fails to hold above the $26 level, it might face a decline to $21. A further fall below this mark could result in a drop to $18. The price movement remains crucial for SOL’s future trajectory. Technical Analysis The market exhibited bullish signals, with the bulls taking control despite a slight dip in buying strength. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicated buyers dominated the market, as it remained above the half-line. Moreover, the price movement above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line highlighted the influence of buyers in driving the price momentum. Should the price maintain its position above the 20-SMA, increased demand is anticipated to propel the asset’s value above the immediate resistance line. This could potentially lead to further bullish movement in the market. Despite the continued dominance of buyers, SOL presented sell signals on the daily chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) formed red signal bars, suggesting a potential slight dip in the price before any attempt to breach the $26 mark. This indicator reflects the price momentum and its shift. Additionally, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) was below the half-line, indicating that capital inflows were lower than capital outflows. Related Reading: Dogecoin Ascendance: How It Captured PEPE Investors’ Attention This observation suggests a potential decrease in buying pressure at the given moment.

42392907,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgD8Vt,1690509618,"U.S. Stablecoin Bill Takes Big Step Despite Fight From Democrats, White House","This is as far as stablecoin legislation has ever progressed in the U.S. Congress, but the advance was tainted by a partisan clash.  A Republican-supported bill was voted out of committee, so it could be set up for a vote on the House floor, which would leave the Senate and presidential signature as its final hurdles.  U.S. House lawmakers cleared stablecoin legislation for the next step in its route through Congress on Thursday, though the House Financial Services Committee moved the bill toward a potential floor vote without bipartisan support as Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) blamed White House objections for the stalemate.  In a contentious hearing Thursday that ended with a 34-16 vote to clear the legislation for wider consideration in the House of Representatives, the panel’s top Democrat, Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), said it was really McHenry who shut down the talks early after negotiations broke down the night before the hearing. The battle sullied what's otherwise the high-water mark of stablecoin progress in Congress.  “Today I had hoped to announce an agreement with the ranking member on stablecoins legislation,” McHenry said at the hearing's outset. “This will not be the case … It was the White House’s unwillingness to compromise that has once again brought that negotiation to a halt.”  The news comes a day after the finance-focused lawmakers advanced three bills on crypto issues to a vote in the full House of Representatives, the first time they advanced laws fully dedicated to the topic. Also today, the House Agriculture Committee followed up with an approval of that crypto markets oversight bill that had previously cleared McHenry's panel.  McHenry said he was “disappointed” with the outcome on the stablecoins work after negotiations spanning 15 months, but he didn't explain the details of the latest disagreement with the executive branch.  Any U.S. stablecoin bill would also have to win support in the Democrat-led Senate, so a bill coming solely from House Republicans rather than a bipartisan effort may be less likely to influence that other chamber. McHenry's choice to push the bill forward over the loud objections of committee Democrats may please fellow Republicans but could also harm its chances of becoming law.  Waters said the bill was “deeply problematic and bad for America,” and that it “promotes a race to the bottom by creating 58 different licenses,” allowing issuers to potentially include a wide range of assets in their reserve and allowing large corporations such as Meta or Walmart to issue money.  According to Waters, Democrats were concerned about the reserve provisions in the bill, as well as the parties' different views on the role federal regulators should have over stablecoin issuers – especially the Federal Reserve's enforcement and supervisory reach into issuers licensed by state agencies.  “I urge Republicans to pull this extremist piece of legislation from the markup,” Waters pressed, though the day ended in a 10 p.m. vote on the bill. “Why the rush? Why can't we continue this negotiation?”  The Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act was introduced by McHenry last week, marking the latest in a long series of stablecoin legislation drafts he's had his hand in since last year, and it seeks to finally offer a regulatory framework for crypto tied to the value of fiat currency. Stablecoins are a core element of the crypto markets, providing steady tokens with which investors can trade in and out of more volatile assets.  The Thursday markup of the Republicans' stablecoin bill was highly combative, with Republicans pushing forward and Democrats dragging their feet on every procedural point. The effort in the committee to openly negotiate the bill's details underlines the ongoing stalemate for U.S. stablecoin oversight.  A White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Waters said neither the Fed nor the U.S. Treasury Department support the bill as it stands.  During the debate, Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) suggested voting be postponed to September, saying Democrats hadn’t had sufficient chance to pitch their ideas. Waters backed up that request, asking McHenry to consider working on it through the August recess of Congress and coming back to finish it after the break.  “We have had no meaningful opportunity to amend this bill ... that's an embarrassment,” Lynch said. “We want to be heard, and we want to have input on this.""  As in the committee's approval of the wider market-structure legislation this week, several Democrats – including Reps. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) and Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) – sided with entire Republican membership of the panel to approve the stablecoin bill.  The committee addressed several other bills on Thursday, also including one from Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) that's meant to protect people's ability to keep self-custodied wallets for crypto assets. Though some Democrats argued that it would allow illicit abuse and let people hide assets from the government, the panel approved it 29-21.

15367222,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544760,1690506012,PancakeSwap Joins The Ranks Of DeFi Giants On zkSync Era: Here’s Why It Matters,"Decentralized Exchange (DEX) PancakeSwap (CAKE), has announced the launch of PancakeSwap v3 on zkSync Era, a Layer 2 scaling solution that promises to deliver improved scalability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness to its users. According to the announcement, with the popularity of ZK rollups increasing and users and builders increasingly looking to L2 solutions, PancakeSwap is thrilled to offer users and developers even more reasons to build and trade on its DEX. The Benefits Of PancakeSwap v3’s Swap Feature On zkSync Era PancakeSwap v3 on zkSync Era comes with several exciting features, including Swap, Liquidity Provision (LP), Farms, and Initial Farm Offering (IFO). The Swap feature allows users to enjoy quick and cost-effective token swaps through a user-friendly interface. With multi-tier fee structures ranging from 0.01% to 1%, traders can select the fee structure that aligns best with their trading preferences and liquidity pool engagement. With low trading fees, users can trade their favorite tokens seamlessly while enjoying enhanced liquidity and reduced slippage. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Records Positive Moves As Bears Took Control, What’s Pushing It? Moreover, the Liquidity Provision feature lets users become part of PancakeSwap’s thriving decentralized exchange ecosystem by providing liquidity. Liquidity providers earn passive income through trading fees when people use their liquidity pool to complete swaps. Per the announcement, with the scalability of zkSync Era, users can maximize their returns, achieving an impressive capital multiplier of up to 4000x. Users can engage in Swap, LP, and social media tasks to earn loyalty points and unlock exclusive NFTs. The Galxe campaign provides an opportunity to explore and experience the power of PancakeSwap on this ecosystem, unlocking the full potential of the platform. Ultimately, the integration with zkSync Era allows PancakeSwap to increase its transaction capacity and reduce congestion on the Ethereum network. As the popularity of DeFi continues to grow, the Ethereum network has become congested, leading to high gas fees and slower transaction times. By leveraging Layer 2 scaling solutions like zkSync, PancakeSwap can significantly increase its transaction capacity, reduce congestion, and offer users a more reliable and cost-effective trading experience. What’s more, the integration with zkSync Era is expected to pave the way for the mass adoption of DeFi. By offering users faster and cheaper transactions, PancakeSwap can attract more users to the platform, increasing the adoption of DeFi as a whole. PancakeSwap’s Revenue Hit By Market Conditions PancakeSwap has experienced some fluctuations in its market performance recently. According to Token Terminal data, PancakeSwap’s circulating market cap is currently $313.88 million, with a 1.16% decline in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, its fully diluted market cap has declined by 3.22% in the same period, currently standing at $1.12 billion. Related Reading: Sui Foundation Dumps MovEX After Contract Violation Similarly, the total value locked on the platform has also decreased by 0.77% in the past 24 hours, currently sitting at $1.23 billion. Over the past 30 days, PancakeSwap has generated $1.20 million in revenue, representing a decline of 26.02%. Its annualized revenue has also decreased by 32.11% to $14.55 million. The trading volume on PancakeSwap for the past year is $40.22 billion, indicating a 16.00% decline. The fully diluted P/F ratio of PancakeSwap has increased by 31.2% to 26.21x, while its P/S ratio has also increased by 29.1% to 76.46x. In the past 30 days, PancakeSwap has generated $3.49 million in fees, representing a decline of 27.23%. Its annualized fees have decreased by 32.59% to $42.45 million. These figures suggest that PancakeSwap’s performance has been impacted by recent market trends. Despite the decline in revenue and trading volume, the platform’s P/F and P/S ratios have increased, indicating a higher valuation for the company.

42392925,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgD9px,1690505363,First Mover Asia: Some Bitcoin Whales Appear Content to Wait for the Next Price Catalyst,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin continued to hold steady above $29.2K and is unlikely to move much until next year, an analyst says.  Insights: Large bitcoin investors holding between 10 and 100 bitcoin, and between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC, are neither selling nor acquiring more of the asset.

As traditional asset markets in Asia opened Friday, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading just above $29,240, down 0.3% over the past 24 hours and roughly where it's stood since a Monday dip triggered by the latest Binance mishap and bad economic news from China.  With a couple of blips under, BTC has been changing hands in a $29,000 to $31,800 range since mid-June – immune from rate hikes, inflationary fears and other macro angst. Brent Xu, the CEO and co-founder ofWeb3 bond-market platform Umee, told CoinDesk in an email that the status quo is likely to continue.  “Bitcoin barely budged following the Federal Reserve’s most recent rate hike, underscoring that this period of heightened rates has pretty much been priced in,"" Xu wrote. ""This is certainly indicative of BTC resilience and indeed resilience for the broader digital asset market. But I’m not expecting a meaningful breakout to the upside any time soon.""  Ether has been similarly inert and was recently trading at $1,862, down 0.4% over the past 24 hours. Other major cryptos were largely in negative territory, albeit not by much with SOL and MATIC, the tokens of smart contract platforms Solana and Polygon, off 0.8% and 0.7%, respectively. Stellar Lumina's XLM token continued its recent upswing, rising 2.9% from Thursday, same time.  Umee's Xu does not expect a return to ""bull market conditions"" until 2024's BTC halving. ""That’s also when we’ll probably start seeing rate cuts happening,"" he wrote. ""Cuts could come sooner, I should caveat, if there’s some sort of breakage that takes place, such as a credit crunch or an acceleration of the banking crisis.”  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Gala GALA +13.7% Entertainment XRP XRP +8.1% Currency Avalanche AVAX +3.7% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Stellar XLM −16.8% Smart Contract Platform Dogecoin DOGE −11.5% Currency Chainlink LINK −10.8% Computing  Insights/News  Some Bitcoin Whales Are Waiting for Price Moves  The bitcoin supply held by addresses with a balance of between 10 and 100 BTC has taken a slight downward turn, indicating that these larger holders of bitcoin are content to wait at the moment.  Data provided by on-chain analytics firm Glassnode underscores that investors are equal parts reluctant to add or relinquish bitcoin, but also that they do not see BTC as undervalued.  Addresses holding between 1,000 and 10,000 bitcoin are exhibiting similar behavior.  Oddly, the amount of bitcoin held by addresses holding between 10,000 and 100,000 has risen slightly, although for bitcoin’s largest holders with more than 100,000 BTC, the supply balance has remained stable.  Each of these cohorts is worth monitoring as they hold the ability to sway markets given the size of their position, and appetite or lack thereof for risk.
