42426082,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIiRxh,1411771262,"All Things Alt: XC Inc, Next-Gen PoS and More Waiting for MintPal","Given the relatively quiet altcoin market, it’s easy to miss the new technologies and interesting applications that are gaining ground.  Yet, as September rolls to a close and October lies just around the corner, it might be premature to assume that the altcoin world is running out of steam as some have suggested. Today’s roundup includes a chat with the developer of XCurrency, a look at I/O’s new proof-of-stake concept and an altcoin that is out of this world.  I/O preps next-gen proof-of-stake framework  The proof-of-stake (PoS) concept has expanded in recent months, including implementations such as reddcoin’s proof-of-stake velocity and proof-of-stake 2.0, developed by the creator of blackcoin.  The development team for I/0 has proposed a new approach to minting blocks that it says will help reduce potential dangers endemic to networks that utilize staking to authorize transactions.  Developer Joel Bosh told CoinDesk that “we are proposing a huge change away from the current PoS inflationary state”. He said that the development process included input and code assessemnt from blackcoin’s lead developer, and explained that the effort is aimed ultimately at improving a promising but flawed process.  The I/O white paper proposes making network fees more flexible to reflect changes in both transaction volume.  The paper explains:  “When the volume becomes insufficient to ensure the demands on the market, each coin and accordingly each transaction fee becomes more expensive. Transaction rates and eventually coin destruction rates decrease, and full volume increases.”  The proposal represents one of the latest efforts to build on existing PoS models, as well as make the technology more resistant to network threats. Past events, including the hard fork of the vericoin network, have raised concerns that proof-of-stake systems are too risky for broader adoption.  The new I/O proof-of-stake system is set to go live on 26th September beginning with the 100,000th network block.  XC developer: Coins need economies to work  The developmental cycle of a digital currency, as demonstrated by both bitcoin and more mature altcoins, sometimes leads to the creation of corporate structures that exist to both promote and grow the project further through product distribution or marketing.  Privacy-oriented altcoin XCurrency, or XC, has recenly begun moving to build a business around its existing development framework. CoinDesk spoke with lead developer and CEO Dan Metcalf, who said that like other existing chains, XC represents a platform on which to build new applications in a decentralized and private environment. However, without the backing of a formalized institution, he said, it makes it more difficult to realize the full potential of a project like XC.  “These applications need a business behind them to be able to sell these services and be the trusted third party or broker,” he said.  Metcalf said that the process of creating what he called XC, Inc. has only just begun, and that the idea is still in the conceptual phase. One idea being developed is an initial token offering, or ITO, with each token signifying partial ownership in XC, Inc.  This decentralized corporation concept has been explored in the past by other groups, though as Metcalf explained, the initiative seeks to reward existing XC stakeholders.  Metcalf told CoinDesk that ultimately, the focus is to build an environment for the currency in which it can be used for real purposes, noting:  “I think one of the reasons that bitcoin worked was because of Silk Road. It was an economy that kept the system fluid until it reached critical mass. In order for XC to be that consumer coin, it needs an economy or the ability to be used over the existing networks – in an user friendly manner.”  MintPal overhaul faces more delays  The much-anticipated launch of Mintpal V2 has experienced another delay.  Owner and operator Moolah LTD, which acquired the altcoin exchange in July after a hack attack, apologized to its customers on Twitter today after previously indicating that final preparations were being made for the platform.  Prior to the hacking, MintPal was one of the more popular and more established altcoin exchanges. Further, the delays come at a time when rival Cryptsy has integrated new services that aim to help it bolster its risk mitigation and compliance.    We really are sorry for the delays, but are just trying to ensure a solid platform. We'll see what we can do to make it up to you all.      — Moolah (@moolah_io) September 26, 2014    Supporters and critics of MintPal took to social media to respond to the company’s message, with some poking fun at what they called a long redesign process that began after Moolah bought the troubled exchange.    Waiting on Mintpal V2 ... pic.twitter.com/90CDRLFbzb      — Taoslap (@taoslap) September 26, 2014          Earlier this week, Moolah wrote on its official blog that the process involved heavy data migration volume, and that many steps needed to be taken before a launch became feasible.  In that post, the exchange owner said that a previously announced two-week period of no-fee trading would be extended by an additional week.  Strange alt of the week  Tribute coins aren’t as in vogue as they once might have been, but every once in a while a new project emerges that takes a light-hearted approach to honoring someone or something.  Borgcoin, which launched at the end of April, is an homage to the eponymous cybernetic race that serves as one of the primary antagonists in the Star Trek universe. According to the developers, the coin is intended to be “the ultimate Star Trek collectible cryptocoin”.  The official Bitcoin Talk post shares a bit of the “inspiration” for the coin, explaining:  “The Borg Queen has noticed the propagation of altcoins in the Alpha Quadrant which will soon reach and influence the Delta Quadrant. The Borg Queen has decided to create her own hive Borg coin. This coin would be scrypt based and would then be used by all borg assimilated planets in the sector and all throughout the Delta Quadrant.”  For its unique approach to a fan currency, borgcoin has won this week’s Strange Alt of the Week award.  The altcoin has a 500m max supply limit, which the developers note is “based on the mass ton of the Borg trans warp ship with a maximum rated speed of 29.968 war factor with advanced warp drive"".  Looking ahead, the developers hope to use the altcoin as a payment product for Star Trek-related products and services, stating that real-world “assimilation” of borgcoin at local merchants are soon to come.  “Join the collective now,” the post notes.

42426069,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIiRbh,1411768111,US Military Command Holds Informational Meeting With Bitcoin Industry,"Officials from the US Special Operations Command met with American business executives and bitcoin community leaders on Monday in Tampa, Florida, to discuss bitcoin and its role in illicit finance.  The topic is a priority for the US military as it seeks to understand how bitcoin could be used in funding anti-American forces and operations and whether it can take actions to reduce this activity.  However, the aptly named Virtual Currency Workshop was a broader learning opportunity for special ops forces, meant to dispel any misconceptions about bitcoin and digital currencies being catalysts for terrorism and illicit activity.  Bitcoin Foundation  global policy counsel Jim Harper attended the meeting, and said his message to the government was that “bitcoin runs on a transparent ledger system"" and that the industry is more than a ""magic cloak for evil behavior”.  Harper told CoinDesk:  “The military has an interest in knowing everything it can know about how the world works, and bitcoin is a big part of how the world is going to work.”  “Demistifying bitcoin is always a good thing,” he added.  Ongoing discussions  The day was part of an ongoing series of talks planned by a group called Business Executives for National Security (BENS), a nonprofit organization of American business leaders that lend their experience and insight to threat reduction initiatives.  Notably, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, former AIG CEO Hank Greenberg and David Koch of Koch Industries are among its distinguished members.  Attendees representing the bitcoin community comprised ""between one-third and a handful"" of all present, Harper estimated.  Further, he suggested that the event was a success as an educational event, as by the day’s end, the gathered attendees had begun to view bitcoin more favorably.  At press time, BENS had confirmed the meeting, but had not responded to further inquiries.  Government cooperation  Harper told CoinDesk he was impressed by the cross section of representatives present at the meeting and the solid discussion and learning that took place. It was perhaps the first time that the three widely disparate cultures have convened formally.  In statements to CNBC, Harper acknowledged the possibility of backlash from members of the bitcoin community following the news of the meeting.  Harper said:  ""The bitcoin community doesn't necessarily endorse US foreign policy, and the bitcoin community doesn't necessarily endorse everything the US intelligence community does.""  However, he went on to say that the Bitcoin Foundation's role should be to familiarize law enforcement and the military with bitcoin.  ISIS concerns  The meeting comes at a time when there has been much discussion about whether bitcoin and digital currency could be used to help radical and extremist organisations gain access to financial services.  In July, Sky News reported that the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) had proposed using bitcoin to fund global jihadist efforts, citing services like DarkWallet as ways to make transactions and payments untraceable. However, this report was later debunked.  Harper said none of the military representatives present at the event offered specific intelligence that ISIS uses bitcoin and that the amount of discourse focused on the terror group was negligible.

42426076,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIiRlh,1411762509,Pheeva Launches Branded Bitcoin Wallet for Georgia Tech,"Love Will, Inc, the team behind the Pheeva bitcoin wallet, has launched a branded bitcoin wallet specifically for students at the Georgia Institute of Technology.  Called 'the Jacket Wallet', the custom bitcoin wallet features Georgia Tech’s signature navy blue and gold colors, and will require users to have a campus email address to enroll.  The wallet was officially unveiled at a kickoff event for the school's first dedicated bitcoin group, Bitcoin@Tech. Held on 24th September, the Bitcoin 101 session featured representatives from Pheeva and Georgia-based payment processor BitPay, as well as about 50 university students.  Mallika Sen, the founder of Bitcoin@Tech and a former BitPay intern, said that she expects interest to grow as more students begin to use the wallet and take advantage of its gamification elements.  Sen told CoinDesk:  “There’s a wide variety of students and people who are interested in bitcoin. They’re very encouraging.”  Students who download the wallet will be able to, in turn, join the COG Cooperative, a dedicated social network that will reward users based on how they promote the network. The wallet will monetize through advertisements, but pay students a share of this revenue based on these participation points.  While unique, the project is likely to be the first of many to launch at universities across the US.  Love Will's big merger  Love Will Inc and bitcoin outreach and charity group The Bitcoin Society announced a merger in conjunction with the wallet launch. The combined businesses, which will operate as Love Will, Inc, will aim to replicate the custom wallet launch at universities across the US this fall.  The move brings The Bitcoin Society and Love Will’s operational strengths under one roof, which will help the group continue pushing its mass rollout model.  Love Will Inc business development consultant Jeff Handler told CoinDesk that there is demand for digital currency launches of this kind, noting:  “Georgia Tech is the first one. I can’t say right now the specific colleges we’re working on, but we’re working to bring this model to every campus that wants to accept bitcoin.”  The project could gain significant traction given that grassroots support for digital currency at US colleges already exists. In addition to the increasing number of student-led bitcoin organizations, several colleges have begun offering digital currency courses, while some have started accepting bitcoin as payment for select services.  Collective vision  The Love Will approach, according to Handler, incorporates a grassroots strategy as demonstrated by the formal launch of the Jacket Wallet this week at Georgia Tech.  Handler said he made the decision to merge his operations with those of the team behind Pheeva after realizing that both companies ""shared a collective vision” as young entrepreneurs in the digital currency space.  Handler explained:  “Entering the bitcoin space as recent college graduates, [The Bitcoin Society] strived to position ourselves as a community-based information hub that could cater to the growing interest in bitcoin amongst college students.”  The two companies began working together this summer, following initial discussions at The North American Bitcoin Conference in Chicago.  Path to college adoption  CoinDesk also spoke with Stephanie Wargo, vice president of marketing for BitPay, who said that the company is working closely with Georgia Tech on upcoming projects.  Wargo said that interest in the bitcoin at Georgia Tech, the former university of executive chairman Tony Gallippi and CEO Stephen Pair, is strong and that the community there has been actively assisting in the run-up to the wallet launch.  Wargo noted:  “The college has been extremely receptive. We’ve been working with them for over a year now, as far as different programs within the university. We’ve gone down to hold some talks, and we’ve been very active and they’ve been extremely receptive of bitcoin.”  Wargo indicated that BitPay hopes to have further announcements regarding the university soon.

42426083,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIiRth,1411758167,Coinify Raises Millions to Build Europe's Complete Bitcoin Solution,"Coinify has announced an undisclosed venture funding round, as well as a string of strategic deals that aim to position it as the leading bitcoin services company for the European market.  Based in Denmark, Coinify acquired a portfolio of services from established market players in May, purchasing established domestic bitcoin broker Bitcoin Nordic and the merchant services formerly offered by Bitcoin Internet Payment Systems (BIPS).  Speaking to CoinDesk, Coinify CEO Hans Henrik Heming framed the new company as a natural pursuit for himself as an established entrepreneur and bitcoin advocate. Heming previously founded social software consultancy Wemind, social graph specialist Wosju and idea lab Fourmation.  Heming told CoinDesk:  ""I read about bitcoin the first time in 2012 and have been looking at the industry in more detail since 2013. [Coinify] emerged from discussions, 'How can we make an entity that could cover more of what is necessary in terms of what the marketplace in Europe has to offer?'""  Earlier this week, Coinify announced a ""multimillion-dollar"" investment from Denmark-based VC firm SEED Capital, which is notably supported by Denmark's state investment fund, The Danish Growth Fund (Vækstfonden in Danish).  Neither Coinify or SEED Capital disclosed the full amount of the funding to CoinDesk, though SEED Capital wrote in its official blog post that the amount was ""several million DKK"".  Following the announcement, Heming said Coinify will close down the Bitcoin Nordic site, while BIPS will continue as a separate entity specializing in bitcoin technology development.  Coinify's services  To begin, Coinify will focus on extending its buy and sell services to consumers and processing services to merchants. Coinify allows businesses to accept bitcoin and receive next-day settlement in euros, dollars and kroner, among other currencies.  Notably, Coinify also provides a plug-in for popular merchant-facing e-commerce platforms that will allow merchants that already use BigCommerce, Magento, Shopify and WooCommerce to easily integrate bitcoin payments.  To enroll, consumers must first use an email address to create an account. From there, traders can buy bitcoin with bank deposits or via prepaid online and mobile phone payment method CASHU.  Merchants can also log into their accounts via Facebook, a feature not extended to those buying and selling on the platform.  Market focus  With the desired capital and services secured, Coinify now aims to focus on growing its presence in its key target markets Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the UK, though Heming said Coinify is keen to establish itself across Europe.  In particular, Heming cited UK and Germany as significant markets due to their position as leaders in the e-commerce space. Further, he said Coinify aims to conduct market research in these areas as it looks to become more active in its approach to the market.  Heming said:  ""What we have done so far has been a reactive approach and waiting for people to sign up. What we will do now with the funds will be to be much more active at acquiring merchants.""  Evaluating the competition  Coinify will also face notable competition in the market from other brokerage services, such as those offered by Safello and Coinbase, the latter of which just recently entered 13 European markets after winning scores of merchants and consumers in the state.  Heming chooses to view these companies more as collaborators than competitors, suggesting that he believes there to be significant, untapped potential in the European market.  He told CoinDesk:  ""I would like to talk to the Safello and Coinbase guys just for information. It could be interesting to discuss how we could go into the markets we want to enter.""  However, this isn't to say that Coinify doesn't aim to differentiate itself from these players, as Heming hinted that his company aims to launch two additional services in the coming months.

42426063,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIiRTh,1411754469,Swedish Politician Elected to Parliament on Bitcoin-Only Donations,"Digital currency advocate Mathias Sundin has become a member of Sweden's parliament after funding his election campaign solely in bitcoin.  Now, and for the next four years, Sundin will represent the constituents of Östergötland in the parliament, which has 349 members from across the country.  Outlining his political agenda on his blog, Sundin made it clear that he would oppose “knee-jerk regulation” of bitcoin and disruptive technologies in general. Taking the advice 'put your money where your mouth is', the politician also made a point of accepting campaign donations solely in bitcoin.  On more wide reaching topics, Sundin promised to back educational reform, defend privacy rights and work toward developing a tax system that promotes innovative, fast-growing companies.  Economies have to keep up with technological advances including bitcoin, he argued, telling CoinDesk:  “An entrepreneur who develops software could potentially reach all these billions of people, and with a simple money transferring system, like bitcoin, he or she will be able to charge for it easier.”  New view forming  Sundin told CoinDesk that he will keep promoting bitcoin in the future, although he is unsure how much backing he will get from fellow MPs.  Sundin said:  “It's hard to say how much support I will get – all the negative headlines about bitcoin have sent the wrong signal about digital currencies, but I also think a new view is forming when you see Dell, maybe eBay, Klarna and others start accepting bitcoin.”  While his focus on bitcoin issues helped get him noticed, Sundin said he doubts that it was his bitcoin advocacy that won him the seat. Rather, it was likely to be linked to his more general policies, he said.  Although his local campaign didn't cost much to set up, the bitcoin donations Sundin received came from all over the world, ""Which I find very positive,” he said.  Sweden’s position on bitcoin  Sundin still believes that more work is necessary to explain the potential of bitcoin. In particular, to persuade banks and other financial organisations that working with bitcoin companies is ultimately a positive thing.  He said:  “We have to keep making the Swedish business climate better. We have to lower taxes for entrepreneurs and decrease regulations. There is a stronger and stronger startup scene in Sweden and Stockholm – one of the hottest in the world.”  Sweden has already managed to attract a number of prominent cryptocurrency businesses, ranging from exchanges to mining companies.  The country’s regulatory framework is relatively liberal and many suggest it will regulate bitcoin as an asset, in line with most of the EU.  However, for all its popularity in Sweden, bitcoin has not had much of an impact on the local economy.  In a recently published research paper, the Swedish Central Bank found that bitcoin trading volumes in the country were relatively low and concluded that bitcoin did not have “any measurable impact” on the country's retail payment market or financial stability.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/26/swedish-politician-elected-to-parliament-on-bitcoin-only-donations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4ae559be7ce1c22593446d8be5904fe962db945a-1250x842.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426077,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIiRph,1411748946,Diamond Circle Launches First Cashless Bitcoin ATM,"Bitcoin ATM maker Diamond Circle has installed its first kiosk at a cafe in Queensland, Australia.  The new unit is located at the Bluff Cafe at Burleigh Heads, a suburb of Gold Coast City. The company describes its machine, unveiled earlier this year, as the first ""cashless bitcoin ATM"" kiosk to hit the market.  The Diamond Circle ATM works in conjunction with its bitcoin debit cards, which were announced last May. Despite their name, these cards are only compatible with the company’s machines, however, and can not be used as debit cards in the traditional sense.  Cashless top-up  The system works by dispensing Diamond Circle cards, which cost $5 and each contain a bitcoin wallet. As well as dispensing cards, the ATM can also be used to top up and check users’ bitcoin balances.  The company says its debit cards are linked to users’ credit cards at local exchange rates, allowing for instant bitcoin purchases. It added in a statement:  “Unlike other bitcoin ATMs, the machine only supports Visa and MasterCard for the purchase of bitcoin and cards thus, reducing security threats, the cost of holding cash, thus increasing margins and ongoing residual payments to distributors and owner/operators.”  The platform is also designed to reduce the risk of chargebacks and can comply with different AML/KYC requirements depending on its jurisdiction.  NFC functionality, SMS remittances  The company is also working on a new feature that could be used to perform remittances, as well as new NFC enabled point of sale systems.  Diamond Circle's remittance function will allow users to send bitcoins to anyone via SMS text message. The company says the cards feature Apple SDK compatibility and at some point they could also use NFC on Apple devices. For the time being, however, Apple’s NFC functionality is limited to Apple Pay.  The company added that it will shortly begin work on new point of sale (POS) applications which will allow bitcoin purchases and balance checking from a wide range of NFC enabled devices, including Android phones, online gateways and corporate wallets.  It also announced plans to sell card readers which can be used at gas stations, parking meters, mass transit services, taxi cabs and by the local merchants.  Australia's love of bitcoin  Of course, this is not the first bitcoin ATM in Australia. A number of establishments have installed similar machines this year and as many as a third of Lamassu's ATMs shipping in late 2013 were headed to Australia.  CoinDesk's Bitcoin ATM Map currently lists 15 active bitcoin ATMs in the country and nearly all of them are located in Melbourne, Sydney, Canberra and Brisbane.  With a population of 23 million, Australia currently boasts more ATMs than Britain, France, Germany and all other countries except Canada and the US.

42426064,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIiRRh,1411738124,Swedish Central Bank Research: Bitcoin Hasn't Affected the Economy,"Bitcoin has not affected the stability of Sweden's economy, according to a new paper published by the country's central bank.  The latest issue of the Sveriges Riksbank Economic Review, published on 18th September, includes the article What is Bitcoin by Bjorn Segendorf, from the bank's Financial Stability Department.  Segendorf provides an overview of the bitcoin protocol, mining and price movements. He also includes a section analysing bitcoin use in Sweden and the currency's interactions with the Swedish krona.  According to Segendorf, retail payments using bitcoin in Sweden are likely to be few and far between. He uses the list of merchants on Bitcoin.se as an estimate, finding that there were 30 businesses accepting bitcoin in Sweden in mid-August.  ""It is mainly a matter of small companies and bitcoin does not seem to have any broad acceptance as a commercial means of payment,"" he wrote.  Segendorf concludes that a large proportion of bitcoin transactions must therefore be taking place with receivers or senders outside Sweden.  Bitcoin-krona trading  Providing an analysis of bitcoin trading on exchanges involving the bitcoin-krona currency pair, Segendorf finds that 266,000 kronor (SEK) – approximately $37,000 or 91 BTC – is traded daily on average. Total trading in bitcoin-krona is about 2% of the bitcoin-euro trading volume and under 1% of bitcoin-dollar trades.  ""The [krona] is thus a minor currency in a bitcoin context,"" Segendorf writes.  The paper notes that the spot market for kronor and dollars sees about 25bn SEK ($3.5bn) traded daily on average.  Segendorf also analyses bitcoin-krona trading volume on exchanges and its relationship to the wider Swedish economy. He finds exchange volume to be a poor indicator of ""pure"" bitcoin payment volumes, but concludes that the traded volumes are so low that they would not impact the Swedish payment system.  Households make payments worth 3bn SEK daily, the paper notes, concluding:  ""Bitcoin has not had any measurable impact on the Swedish retail payment market or financial stability.""  The paper also notes some of the risks and benefits associated with bitcoin. Among the benefits are bitcoin's decentralised design which contributes to a ""more robust"" payments system independent of traditional ""infastructure hubs"" and the low cost of bitcoin transactions.  Risks the paper identifies include bitcoin's high volatility, which could lead to instability if major financial organisations had substantial bitcoin holdings.  The central bank's Economic Review is published each quarter containing articles on ""topics relevant to the Riksbank's field of operation"". The research contained in it is not the official view of the Swedish central bank, according to the Riksbank's website.  Sweden is home to several notable bitcoin companies including ASIC maker KnCMiner and exchange Safello.

42426072,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIiRfh,1411728989,MIT Students Challenge New Jersey State in Tidbit Legal Case,"In March, CoinDesk reported on a legal spat between a team of MIT students led by Jeremy Rubin, and the State of New Jersey.  Rubin’s team had developed a software system called Tidbit that could allow websites to use visitors’ computers to mine bitcoin. In return, the visitors would not see advertising.  However, last December, the State of New Jersey issued a subpoena asking the team for details of its project, including the source code, addresses of bitcoin wallets associated with it, installation logs, and others.  Now, a New Jersey judge is to decide whether the team of academics must hand over details of their bitcoin project to government officials in that state. The legal dispute could be a landmark case for technology researchers everywhere.  Decision imminent  The idea behind the project, developed at the Node Knockout hackathon, was to help website owners to monetise their content. Tidbit has since been taken down.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit civil liberties group specialising in cyber issues, took on Rubin’s case, challenging New Jersey’s right to subpoena the code.  As part of that challenge, a court hearing took place on Monday (selected legal filings from the case can be viewed at the EFG website).  Rubin was not required to appear in court in person. Instead, the judge took the issue under submission, saying he will issue a written opinion within the next 30 days. The legal dispute could be a landmark case for technology researchers everywhere.  Out-of-state filings  One of the most significant aspects of the subpoena – and the key fact that the EFF is building its case on – is that New Jersey went after a group of students in another state, which the defending attorneys say oversteps legal boundaries.  The EFF initially said that “Tidbit’s code is not functional and unable to mine for bitcoins at all”.  Furthermore, on its Node Knockout page, the Tidbit team said that 98% of the infrastructure was complete, but that they hadn’t connected the service to the P2Pool service that would be necessary to complete the bitcoin mining. “So we currently do not receive any bitcoins,” it said at the time.  So why did New Jersey issue the subpoena, or even care at all about this technology?  TidBit in use?  The State of New Jersey argues that Tidbit code has indeed been used – and on sites based in New Jersey.  In a filing on 6th March, New Jersey Attorney General investigator Brian Morgenstern said that “the Tidbit Code was present on at least three (3) websites that were registered and located in New Jersey”.  A message from the Tidbit team, linked to from Rubin’s own website, also refers explicitly to ""Tidbit users"", likening itself to startups that receive legal challenges:  “We’ve gotten word from some of our Tidbit users that the NJ Attorney General has served them subpoenas requesting information regarding Tidbit. If you get served one, don’t worry. Get in touch with your legal counsel.”  The EFF seems to have recognised this in later documents. A response, issued on 20th March, acknowledged New Jersey’s claims, focusing on the fact that Rubin and his team made no specific attempts to create commercial relationships with people in New Jersey.  “The mere fact Tidbit’s code appeared on New Jersey websites is not enough to permit New Jersey to regulate Tidbit – an out of state actor – under the Dormant Commerce Clause,” it said. “The State is absolutely capable of regulating and investigating the specific New Jersey websites running Tidbit code. But its powers cannot extend to Tidbit or Mr Rubin.”  Criminal case?  A source close to the Attorney General’s office said that New Jersey isn’t yet accusing Rubin of any wrongdoing. The office will occasionally serve a subpoena if it’s reviewing matters that come up that may be of concern, but this doesn’t involve any public action unless the office ends up filing a formal public complaint.  The source said:  “It was Jeremy Rubin or Tidbit that chose to publicise this when they received a subpoena from the state. It’s been out there publicly due to the EFF, but normally we wouldn’t be publicising this at all.”  Nevertheless, the language used in the State’s court filings suggests that an investigation into Tidbit under the State’s Consumer Fraud Act is at least a possibility.  EFF attorneys have called this out in legal filings, claiming among other things that the likelihood of an investigation would cause financial harm to Rubin, because he’s at risk of civil liability from the State of New Jersey. New Jersey has disagreed.  One crucial question for lawmakers in New Jersey is whether the code was used to mine for bitcoins on visitors’ machines without their consent, CoinDesk has learned from sources close to the Attorney General’s office, which refused to comment on the record this week.  'Chilling' effects  Hanni Fakhoury  , staff attorney at the EFF, refused to comment on the case, other than to talk about the chilling effect of the subpoena on innovation. He made specific reference to a letter, sent to the state on 19th March by MIT.  “The letter submitted by MIT faculty, students and administrators indicates that there’s a chilling effect, in the sense that innovators face legal uncertainty about whether their projects will get them in far flung states they have no connection too [sic],” he said.  The letter said that the subpoena “threatens the ability to innovate on our campus and on campuses around the world, including at New Jersey’s world class universities”.  Doubtful utility  New Jersey’s subpoena will be of interest to legal and entrepreneurial watchers alike, for several reasons. It will have tangible implications for innovation in cryptocurrency activities such as bitcoin mining. But the Tidbit tool also theoretically addresses a long-standing problem for content websites: how to monetise content in an age where competition drives down revenues.  “Tidbit takes on a major problem facing online publishers – the challenge of developing a revenue stream – and offers a new solution”, said the MIT letter.  There have been other uses of bitcoin to disrupt traditional payment models for online media, though. The Chicago Sun-Times has successfully tested bitcoin-based paywalls as a means of charging micropayments for its content.  It is also unclear just how practical a tool like Tidbit would be. It isn’t the first such project to hit the Internet. BitcoinPlus was offering embeddable browser-based bitcoin mining long before Rubin and his colleagues won their innovation award at Node Knockout.  With bitcoin hash rates so high, and CPU/GPU users all but vanquished from that activity, is there any real utility in these systems? Perhaps, if many hundreds of thousands of machines could be co-opted, although mining for a scrypt-based currency might be more worthwhile.  The judge's decision should be announced by the end of November.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/26/mit-students-challenge-new-jersey-state-in-tidbit-legal-case,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c52546e7bd57396809df7d007fe185f7263e8a00-1280x838.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426067,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIiRVh,1411720476,"'Bash Bug' a Concern, But Little Threat to Bitcoin Services","There were widespread security concerns yesterday after the discovery of an old flaw that could affect web servers and Internet-connected devices – but many in the industry are claiming it presents no immediate threat to bitcoin services.  The vulnerability, dubbed either the 'Bash Bug' or the 'Shellshock Bug', would allow a malicious access to a UNIX-based device's operating system via the command line shell – the most widely used of which is bash.  UNIX-based systems include MacOS, Linux versions (desktop and server), popular mobile platforms and embedded systems on other devices that communicate online.  CNET reported that security expert Robert Graham, described it as ""as big a deal as Heartbleed"" – the OpenSSL flaw discovered in April – given the ""enormous percentage of software that interacts with the shell"".  'Over-hyped'  Jeff Garzik  , bitcoin core developer and now senior software engineer at BitPay, however, said there is no clear and present danger to bitcoin users.  ""Prediction: bash bug NOT bigger threat than heartbleed,"" he posted on a Reddit thread.  Garzik told CoinDesk that, while the newly-discovered bug had the potential to be bad, ""most online services using bitcoin are far more secure than your average home router"".  He added that the Bash Bug would impact mostly non-bitcoin sites, and was being over-hyped.  ""It requires special set of conditions to be exploitable, and home routers and ancient Apache web servers were already Swiss cheese security anyway. I think the practical impact will be much less than the mainstream media is making it out to be.""  Bitcoin a target?  At this stage, there are no reports of any exploit of the Bash Bug affecting any bitcoin-related services. So why care at all?  Bitcoin services may potentially be a more attractive target for hackers and thieves than more established, fiat-based services like online banking and PayPal.  There are two historic reasons for this: poor security implementation at some early-stage online bitcoin services, and the reluctance of authorities to investigate or punish digital currency crimes, unless they suspect drugs or money laundering are involved.  Therefore it is best to at least be aware of potential problems developers and services may face.  One exchange's view  Yan Chuan or 'YC', CTO of exchange BitBays.com, said the bug was ""relatively easy for hackers to use"", and recommended all users patch, back up logs, and check systems to see if any attack had occurred.  Because the bug allowed malicious hackers full access to an operating system there was potential for any kind of attack, from stealing bitcoin wallets to installing keyloggers and backdoors.  YC said bitcoin itself would not be affected due to its decentralized structure.  ""However, as a centralized provider of exchange or wallet services it is possible to be affected by the bash bug. Due to the presence of this vulnerability, open SSH, HTTP, FTP and other application servers are all at risk of being remotely accessed and controlled by a hacker.""  Since Windows is not UNIX-based, its desktop users would not be affected themselves. BitBays' platform is prepared, YC continued, but concerned users of other platform might like to ask their exchange or wallet service about the situation if unsure.  Cracked shell  The Bash Bug vulnerability stems from a serious security flaw that exists in the bash (Bourne Again SHell) command 'env'. It affects the local shell, as well as SSH, FTP, HTTP, and other important services.  YC explained how the bug could be exploited, saying that many web servers send the user’s HTTP request information (REMOTE_HOST), REQUEST_METHOD, QUERY-STRING, etc) stored in an environment variable, to the backend Web framework or CGI scripts.  If this information includes malicious instructions, the next time the server executes bash it will execute the malicious instructions. Thus, the server is compromised.  At present, the popular Apache + PHP and Nginx + wsgi frameworks are vulnerable.  No quick fix  According to Red Hat, which issued its own security advisory, many programs access the bash shell in the background. Several Linux distributions have already made patches available, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS.  The bug, which has actually existed for more than 25 years before the release of today's news, could affect millions of devices and leave much older ones in need of patching. It is the sheer number of devices in need of patching, rather than the flaw's complexity or known exploits, that has some experts concerned.
