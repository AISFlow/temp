42431201,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN13nh,1575583200,Former eToro Analyst to Provide Crypto-Trading Course for Cointelligence,"Mati Greenspan, the financial-markets analyst who stepped down last month from crypto-friendly trading platform eToro to start his own research and consulting firm, plans to offer training videos on trading bitcoin and other digital assets through the website Cointelligence.      Greenspan, whose new firm Quantum Economics specializes in research and analysis on financial markets, says the new online training course will include some interactive features and will likely cover trading strategies as well as a broad overview of the crypto industry and economic topics that could affect the price of digital assets like bitcoin.      The course will launch ""soon,"" said Greenspan. He expects to offer some in-depth but broad analysis of the crypto markets.      ""Crypto has to be seen from a macro perspective,"" Greenspan said in a phone interview.      Greenspan, 36, built up a following in the crypto markets as a senior market analyst for eToro, which started out as a foreign-exchange website but pivoted in 2017 to add a focus on bitcoin and other digital assets.      Cointelligence specializes in crypto-focused training courses and market-surveillance tools including an exchange-rating system, according to its website. The company also provides research to corporate clients on blockchain and cryptocurrency topics. Cointelligence CEO On Yavin confirmed the arrangement with Greenspan via a WhatsApp message.

42431198,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN13fh,1575581409,Ripple Files Last Bid to Dismiss XRP Securities Lawsuit Before Court Meeting,"Even if XRP were a security, the investors suing Ripple brought their case far too late for it to proceed, the company said in a new filing.      Further, subsequent arguments made by the plaintiffs contradict their original claims, Ripple said in the Dec. 4 filing with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.      It's the latest document filed in the back-and-forth since a federal court appointed Bradley Sostack the lead plaintiff in the ongoing case. Sostack filed his initial amended complaint in August 2019. The plaintiffs claim the company sold XRP as an unregistered security to retail investors.      The filing largely reiterated arguments Ripple made in an earlier motion to dismiss the case: that the amended complaint filed in August missed a legal deadline to pursue claims after an event; that the lead plaintiff still hasn’t been able to show that he bought XRP from any of the defendants (or during an initial offering); and that the claims that XRP is a security conflict with the plaintiff’s claims under California’s state consumer protection law.      As such, Ripple once again has sidestepped the most important question the case poses for the digital asset industry: whether XRP, the third largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is a security under U.S. law.      ""XRP is not a security, but that is irrelevant for purposes of this motion. Even if XRP were a security, Plaintiff's claims still fail as a matter of law,” the filing said (emphasis from the original document).      The filing is the last before the parties meet in court next month to argue over the motion to dismiss.    Ship has sailed?    Despite the plaintiff's claims that Ripple’s engaged in an ongoing offering of securities, the filing said, Ripple first began selling XRP in 2013, meaning any case brought after the three-year statute of repose should be dismissed.      “The Court’s passing reference to the statute of repose running ‘from the defendant’s last culpable act (the offering of the securities),’ ... does not upend the ‘first-offered’ rule,” the filing said, referencing a number of other court cases which supported this argument.      The statute of repose argument was successfully used by defendants in a number of mortgage-backed securities cases several years ago, Rebecca Rettig, a partner at FisherBroyles, previously told CoinDesk.      Ripple reply also took aim at a line in the plaintiff’s response, filed Nov. 4, which said “Ripple issues new XRP from escrow for the first time each month for sale to the public.”      According to the Dec. 4 filing, this argument contradicts the plaintiff’s original amended complaint, which said “all 100 billion XRP were created out of thin air by Ripple in 2013, prior to its distribution to investors.”      (A bullet point in the new filing further claims that the modifications plaintiff alleged changed XRP were actually made to “Rippled,” the software underpinning the XRP ledger.)      The filing also takes aim once again at claims that Ripple sold the XRP to the plaintiff, claiming that there was a “one-in-ten-thousand chance” that this could have occurred.      According to the filing, “Ripple’s alleged exchange sales of XRP accounted for .095 percent—less than one-tenth of one percent—of the total volume of XRP sold on exchanges” during the time period Sostack said he bought XRP.      The parties will meet in court on Jan. 15, 2020.",NEUTRAL,XRP,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/05/ripple-files-last-bid-to-dismiss-xrp-securities-lawsuit-before-court-meeting,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b6aa9dbc01928378ee3333b1c3327423af17ad11-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374501,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWva035,1575568811,Ethereum's Top DEX Is Rebooting With New Scaling Features,"A non-contentious hard fork, Istanbul consists of six ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs) including EIP 2028, which reduces the gas fee for requesting calldata from 68 gas per byte to 16 gas per byte. Calldata is information broadcast on the ethereum state necessary for creating specific smart contracts.  By reducing gas fees, Rollup-based smart contracts, which bundle on-chain transactions off-chain, have become an expedient scalability tool – for IDEX and others.  In an email sent to CoinDesk after the initial publication of this article, IDEX said its rollup design, the Optimized Optimistic Rollup (O2R), was developed independently of the Istanbul hard fork.  Istanbul includes code improvements capable of supporting Layer 2 systems such as Rollups, a tech first developed in 2018 by ethereum developer barryWhiteHat and ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. The improvements were created with the intent of fostering privacy-based, Layer 2 solutions on ethereum.  Aurora Labs CTO Jason Ahmad said IDEX was looking for different Layer 2 solutions for scaling when his team found Optimistic Rollups, created by ConsenSys scalability researcher John Adler and also ethereum scalability project Plasma Group, at this year’s Devcon, an Ethereum hackathon in Osaka, Japan, two months before the planned ethereum hard fork.  Ahmad said IDEX’s O2R improves on Adler’s design, giving it “unbounded” scalability – a handy feature given the amount of contracts an exchange settles daily. Unboundedness is a feature Adler has publicly disputed.  “As the creator of optimistic rollup, that kind of behavior saddens me, because the design paradigm can easily stand on its own merits without being fluffed up,” Adler said in a message to CoinDesk. (Adler, it should be noted, is a co-founder of Fuel, one of about 10 firms working on Rollups.)  Adler specifically pointed out the claim of “instant, gas-free transactions” as being untrue, saying in an email all contracts must sync back to the mainchain at some point which has inherent gas requirements. The two entities have since gone public with their disagreements, feuding Friday on Twitter.  For Aurora Labs, the company behind IDEX, Rollups mean lowering operating costs as well as boosting transaction speeds, Ahmad said. The CTO expects IDEX’s O2R Rollups to reduce gas fees by as much as 90 percent on the new platform.  “The design for off-chain exchange functionality with on-chain custody and settlement is much more efficient, much more cost-effective and frankly is a better judicious use of the scarce blockchain resource,” Ahmad said.  Update (Dec. 5, 18:25 UTC): A prior version of this story said the new IDEX platform was launching Thursday. Only a demo is currently available.

42431216,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN14Fh,1575554400,"Crypto Lender BlockFi Rolls Out Zero-Fee Trading  for Bitcoin, Ether, GUSD","BlockFi, the cryptocurrency lending service backed by Galaxy Digital, Winklevoss Capital, ConsenSys Ventures and others, is expanding into trading with an unusual, zero-fee model.      The startup has made a name for itself by offering investors a way to realize a return on their crypto without selling it. Clients deposit bitcoin, ether or the GUSD stablecoin with BlockFi, then take out U.S. dollar loans against their crypto collateral or earn interest on their deposits. BlockFi lends the crypto to big institutional players that use it for trading and pay interest, which the lender passes back to depositors.      Starting Thursday, users have one more option: they can buy or sell using their balances – for example, buy more bitcoin using the GUSD or ether they've deposited or vice versa.      There will be no trading fees, as the service will have a different profit model: the money will be coming from selling data on the users’ trades to big institutional crypto firms that, in turn, will act as market makers at BlockFi, providing liquidity.      “Market makers want the information about what trades are happening, and they get it by having relationships with as many venues as they can support to receive that order flow,” BlockFi CEO Zac Prince said. The data will be anonymized when the service is up and running, the company said.      Some of these market makers have been BlockFi’s clients on the crypto lending side already, and some of them are also the startup’s equity investors, like Susquehanna, Akuna Capital and CMT Digital, Prince said. The fact that the institutions will be doing multiple activities on BlockFi will help build strategic relationships with them, he said.      BlockFi decided to expand into the exchange business after a customer survey found users tended to withdraw their crypto for trading purposes, Prince said.      “We ask a subset of clients ‘why are you withdrawing?’ when they do withdraw and the most common answer has been ‘to trade’,” Prince said. “Our existing user base wanted to trade and requested that we build a product for trading on our platform.”    Fiat on-ramp    BlockFi will also add more options for interest-earning accounts and trading: starting early 2020 users will be able to deposit and buy USDC and litecoin. (The original date given by BlockFi was Dec. 11, but after this story was published the company contacted CoinDesk to say it was pushed back.)      The company would not disclose exact numbers, but, according to Prince, “tens of thousands” of people are now keeping their crypto with BlockFi, and more than 50 institutional players are borrowing from it. But that’s not enough for this venture capital-funded outfit: in addition to experienced crypto holders, BlockFi wants to attract first-time buyers, too.      For this category, BlockFi is planning to open fiat-to-crypto trading, Prince said. The fiat gateway is expected to go live sometime during the first quarter of 2020. BlockFi has been ramping up its compliance work: the company recently secured a money services business (MSB) registration with the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).      It’s also working on getting money transmission licenses in a bunch of states — Prince wouldn’t disclose which ones but said BlockFi is “pretty close"" to getting a license in some of them.      And its ambitions go further: in the second half of 2020, BlockFi is planning to launch a crypto rewards credit card.      “Up until now, we’ve been focused on building products for existing crypto investors so they could get the same type of services as in traditional finance. In 2020, we’re going to launch products that will enable us to add new consumers to the crypto ecosystem,” Prince said.    Changing rates    When the clients buy crypto on BlockFi it will automatically go into their interest accounts and start earning interest if a client chooses this option, Prince said. BlockFi launched the interest-earning accounts in March, offering up to 6.2 percent in compound interest on bitcoin and ether deposits.      BlockFi has changed the terms for the interest accounts several times: in April, the rates were cut for accounts larger than 25 bitcoin or 500 ether; in May, the threshold for lower rates dropped further to 250 ETH and later on, to 5 BTC and 200 ETH.      Last week, the terms changed again: now the 6.2 percent rate will be applicable to holdings lower than 10 BTC, while everything a user have above this will earn only 2.2 percent annually. For ether, deposits below 1,000 ETH will be earning 4.1 percent annually, and everything above only 0.5 percent. The rate for any amount of GUSD is now 8.6 percent.      Prince explained that the changes in the terms had to do with the balance between retail clients who are keeping their crypto at BlockFi and institutional clients that are borrowing crypto for trading.      “Initially, we were positively surprised how much we received on the side of deposits and we had to give the institutions time to catch up,” Prince said. Now, “we’ve never been so balanced, and it’s growing every day,” he added.      As for the latest change, “we raised the tiers because we were seeing an uptick in demand and wanted to raise more supply, plus, pass on more of the value to our clients,” Prince said.      Staff doubles    Initially backed by ConsenSys Ventures, SoFi, Kenetic Capital and Galaxy Digital, BlockFi brought in more investors in an August Series A round, including Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures, Winklevoss Capital, Morgan Creek Digital and Akuna Capital.      The recent $18.4 million funding helped to substantially grow the team: compared to about 30 people that had been working at BlockFi this summer, the company now has over 60 people, half of them engineers, Prince said.      There has been some finance talent acquisition, too: in October, the company hired Jessica Raybeck, a former vice president at Nomura and Citi, as the head of institutional client relationship management.

42431202,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN13xh,1575554400,Pompliano Joins Board of Blockchain-Based Lending Firm After $103M Raise,"Blockchain-based consumer lender Figure Technologies has added Morgan Creek Digital’s Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano, one of the sector’s most exuberant supporters, to its board. It's also announced a $103 million funding round.      Figure plans to use the funds to expand its lending products that run on a blockchain, but the Series C funding round was primarily opportunistic, said chief executive Mike Cagney.      “The company has plenty of cash from an execution standpoint,” said Cagney, who previously led online consumer finance company SoFi.      Morgan Creek pushed the idea of the round, and Figure agreed to it to add Pompliano on its board and secure other strategic partners, including Japan’s MUFG (the bank’s VC arm participated in the round), Cagney said.      The raise brings Figure’s total funding to more than $225 million and values it at $1.2 billion, according to a company press release. Aside from Morgan Creek, which led the round, and MUFG, participants included DCM, Digital Currency Group, HCM Capital, Ribbit Capital, RPM Ventures and The Partners at DST Global. While the size of the round was disclosed in a securities filing last month, the other details were not revealed until now.      Best known for its home equity line of credit (HELOC) product, Figure began offering student loan and mortgage refinance products earlier this year. Figure has originated around $1 billion in loans, with $700 million of that being blockchain-based HELOCs.      “Figure has grown from an idea approximately two years ago to become the fourth largest HELOC originator in the United States,” Pompliano said.      Provenance, a distributed blockchain with 12 node operators, is the foundation of Figure’s lending products. It removes the document workload involved in loan origination, financing and sales, according to the company. Cagney claims that the blockchain saves Figure more than 130 basis points on originating HELOCs. That would add up to $1,560 on an average-size loan of $120,000.      Figure’s business model aligns with the Morgan Creek fund’s investment thesis that every stock, bond, currency, and commodity will eventually be digitized, Pompliano said.      “Currently, the DTCC settles approximately $2 quadrillion of transactions annually, but their technology is not equipped to settle these digital asset transactions,” he said, referring to the central securities depository for the U.S. “Figure has shown that the combination of numerous frontier technologies can significantly disrupt these markets.”      Morgan Creek also participated in Figure’s $65 million Series B round this year. In May, Figure closed a $1 billion uncommitted line of credit from investment bank Jefferies and WSFS Financial Corporation.

42431204,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN13ph,1575554400,Matter Labs Unveils Layer-2 Scaling Solution for Ethereum Payments,"The latest ethereum hard fork, Istanbul, is bringing Layer 2 solutions to the network – this time in the form of a payment channel.      Cryptographic research hub Matter Labs released Thursday the testnet of ZK-Sync, in what the firm claims is a step toward making blockchains compete with centralized systems for handling millions of transactions a day.      Famously, Visa can handle 24,000 credit card transactions per second (tps) while ethereum can only deal with about 15 tps.      “ZK-Sync resembles a blockchain on top of the blockchain, which is completely fungible so you can send money to somebody else,” Matter Lab CEO Alex Gluchowski said in a phone interview. “Nobody has to be online and check it for me. And it feels very much like using a normal blockchain.”      Based on Rollups, a scaling protocol first proposed by ethereum developer barryWhiteHat and expounded upon by ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin in 2018, the Layer 2 solution uses zero-knowledge proofs (also known as zk-SNARKs) and recent changes to the ethereum network from the Istanbul hard fork for implementation.      A full programming framework launch is slated for January 2020.    The tech behind ZK-Sync    ZK-Sync transactions are completed using a smart contract created on the ethereum state, the underlying blockchain which serves as a digital ledger of all ethereum transactions.      However, Matter Labs created a sidechain for ethereum transactions to interact with one another without touching the mainchain. By operating off-chain in smart contract-based escrow accounts, ZK-Sync transactions settle more quickly and have the potential to cost less, Matter Labs’ said in a technical release.      Funds move between users inside the smart contract, which is orchestrated by validators and guardians. When a contract is open, validators package transactions into blocks. Elected by guardians, validators have a near-perfect probabilistic guarantee of participating honestly with safety features such as built-in collateral (to disincentivize cheating). Users also decide when a contract closes, sending funds back to the main ethereum chain. In other words, the funds are always #safu.    Gas fees on the blockchain    Other Layer 2 ethereum solutions have stalled at the same point, facing costs too high to justify using the system. As Gluchowski said, Istanbul proved to be the answer for Matter Labs and other Layer 2 payment systems.      Like a mailing service, users pay a gas fee to transmit information on the ethereum blockchain. As an open market, the miners that transmit the information can charge varying amounts of gas by raising or lowering fees on certain types of data, specifically calldata.      Calldata refers to information requested by smart contracts outside of the contract itself, broadcast on the network. Typically priced at 68 gas per byte, Istanbul lowers the price by a factor of four to 16 gas per byte through a new ethereum improvement proposal (EIP). While gas costs were previously too high to implement ZK-Sync-styled contracts, the lower calldata rates open up a new Layer 2 option.      “After Istanbul, with the cost of calldata as low as it's going to be, we will have a lot of, ‘Let's see what happens.’ We're going to be in a very good position so we can easily get to thousands of transactions per second,” Gluchowski said.      With calldata so cheap, ZK-Sync is setting its sights on matching traditional financial services such as Visa and PayPal, Gluchowski said.    Why zk-SNARKs?    Blockchains prove the validity of transactions by broadcasting the inputs and outputs to all other participants on the network. In short, group consensus proves transaction validity.      However, when working off-chain, a new checks-and-balances system is needed to replace the group vote. That’s where zk-SNARKs come in.      A compact way of communicating anonymous information, zk-SNARKs can be used to prove the total holdings of a contract without revealing its inner workings. By packaging transactions off-chain and stamping them with a cryptographic proof for validity, Matter Labs says Layer 2 solutions like ZK-Sync have the possibility to scale ethereum’s current payment network.      In order to create a protocol that was both censorship-resistant and could scale at mass, Matter Labs constructed its own zk-SNARK variant, Redshift, which included more trustless features than alternatives such as zcash’s Halo.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/12/05/matter-labs-unveils-layer-2-scaling-solution-for-ethereum-payments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8dba93f884c203ad42ebdf057a98351185305981-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to Microsoft:    ""Microsoft and Enjin have collaborated in a local pilot to create a blockchain based recognition programme. The Azure Heroes badgers were created in a number of original and unique designs which have been tokenised into a digital asset on the Ethereum public blockchain.

42431210,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN143h,1575547200,Ex-Morgan Stanley Executives Launch Crypto Derivatives Platform in Singapore,"A team of Morgan Stanley veterans has launched a crypto derivatives trading platform, claiming it is faster and more secure than some of the market’s biggest players.      Jack Tao, who served as a senior leader at Morgan Stanley's electronic trading desk, said he launched Phemex last month with a team of more than 30 developers, including eight executives from the investment banking giant.      Tao left his job at Morgan Stanley in New York and co-founded the crypto trading firm in Singapore in July, envisioning a platform that would be as fast and secure as stock and futures exchanges.      The budding firm has made some big promises.      “Phemex is ten times faster than traditional crypto trading platforms with the ability to manage 300,000 TPS – the fastest matching engine online,” said Tao, who specialized in high-frequency trading. No existing platform has achieved such transaction speeds, he said.      Phemex’s architecture can reduce latency so as to deliver an order entry and response time of less than one millisecond while maintaining stable APIs for algorithmic trading, according to Tao.      While crypto trading is fiercely competitive, Tao believes Phemex has a comparative advantage as a small platform.      “Big trading platforms such as CME [Chicago Mercantile Group] are very great platforms for traditional securities trading, but that’s also why they are relatively slow to adopt emerging technologies and trade digital assets,” Tao said.      Such platforms are more cautious about entering into new markets whereas startups tend to be more experimental with new frontiers, he said.      Phemex offers retail and institutional investors perpetual contracts for bitcoin, ethereum and XRP with up to 100 times leverage. These are similar to futures contracts, except they have no expiration date.      As the exchange gains traction, it plans to also offer contracts backed by traditional financial products, including stock indexes, interest rates and commodities, Tao said.      The ex-Morgan Stanley developers have created their own hierarchical deterministic cold wallet system. It assigns an independent deposit address to each user to keep assets in the cold wallets directly.      The move to Singapore is aimed at meeting demand in the Asian markets with a more favorable regulatory environment, Tao said. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced last month that it would allow crypto-based derivatives to be traded on regulated platforms.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/05/ex-morgan-stanley-executives-launch-crypto-derivatives-platform-in-singapore,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9fbd03a74e079a6b9078156744f7c400bf6759af-1500x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42431212,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN14Dh,1575546252,Bitcoin's Rejection at Key Price Hurdle Puts Short-Term Bull Trend at Risk,"View  A sharp reversal from resistance at $7,800 on Wednesday has neutralized bitcoin's short-term bullish setup.  The cryptocurrency has created an inverted hammer on the daily chart, a warning of an impending sell-off. A break below the candle's low of $7,087 will likely invite stronger selling pressure and yield a drop to $6,500.  A UTC close above $7,870 (Nov. 29 high) is needed to revive the bullish view.    Bitcoin experienced a strong rejection at key resistance Wednesday, weakening the short-term bullish outlook.      The top cryptocurrency by market value quickly jumped from $7,200 to $7,800 during the U.S. trading hours on Wednesday, ending a low-volume pullback, as expected. The ascent, however, was short-lived, and prices fell back just as speedily – closing the day (UTC) with a 1.4 percent loss at $7,198, according to Bitstamp data.      The sharp move lower from $7,800 – a level that proved a tough nut to crack at the end of November – has increased the likelihood of bearish price action with the formation of a candlestick pattern called an ""inverted hammer.""      While the pattern is considered a bearish signal, traders usually wait for confirmation in the form of strong follow-through, preferably a convincing move below the low of the candle.      Put simply, a break below Wednesday's low of $7,087, if confirmed, will likely attract strong selling pressure, possibly leading to a deeper drop.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $7,330, representing a 1.4 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.    Daily chart    The long upper shadow attached to the inverted hammer candle represents ""sell on the rise"" mentality.      So far, there's been no bearish follow-through. However, that does not mean the path of least resistance is to the higher side, as the cryptocurrency is also held below the resistance of a descending trendline sloping downwards through the Oct. 26 and Nov. 15 highs.      A bullish reversal would only be confirmed if and when the cryptocurrency finds acceptance above $7,870 (Nov. 29 high), invalidating the lower-highs setup.      If prices find acceptance under $7,087 (inverted hammer's low), that would imply a continuation of the sell-off from $7,870 and will likely yield a re-test of recent lows near $6,511.    3-day chart    Bitcoin charted a bullish hammer reversal pattern in the six days to Nov. 29. So far, however, the follow-through has been anything but bullish, and has faced strong rejection at $7,800, as noted above.      As a result, the immediate outlook is neutral.      Other indicators continue to call a bearish move. For instance, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) remains below 50 and the 5- and 10-week moving averages continue to trend south.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/05/bitcoins-rejection-at-key-price-hurdle-puts-short-term-bull-trend-at-risk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/28ce8f3501d6a4ccadba6e28318665d236577f37-1500x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to bankruptcy filings late in November, the firm has just 4.6 million Canadian dollars (US$3.5 million) in assets, but owes creditors CA$13.2 million (US$10 million), CBC News reported Wednesday.      Having run centers in Labrador City and Happy Valley-Goose Bay, both in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Great North Data had received business support from federal and provincial governments.      Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA) is listed as an unsecured creditor owed CA$281,675. The Canadian government agency aims to create opportunities for economic growth in the Canadian Atlantic region.      The ACOA had funded the firm to the tune of CA$500,000 back in 2015 – money that was to be repaid under an agreement. The agency told CBC News that it is ""in contact with the client and are closely following all developments"" regarding the bankruptcy.      The data processor also owes CA$313,718 to the Business Investment Corporation of the provincial Newfoundland and Labrador government. That funding is tied up in Great North Data assets, including building, land and equipment, and arises from a loan of CA$420,000, according to the report.      Additionally, Great North Data leaves a hefty power bill still to be paid, with Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro listed as an unsecured creditor owed CA$316,477.      No specific reasons are provided for the company's collapse in the report, but the bankruptcy came amid record mining difficulty and falling bitcoin prices.

The recommendation came in an annual report published Wednesday by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, set up after 2008 to help identify emerging risks that could trigger a new banking crisis. The panel also includes U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Jay Clayton and Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Heath Tarbert.      ""The council recommends that federal and state regulators continue to examine risks to the financial system posed by new and emerging uses of digital assets and distributed ledger technologies,"" the report said.      U.S. lawmakers and administration officials including Mnuchin and President Donald J. Trump have warned of the risks to the financial system from cryptocurrencies and stablecoins like Facebook's proposed Libra. But some former officials, including ex-CFTC Chair Christopher Giancarlo, have pushed for faster adoption of blockchains, arguing that the country could fall behind other countries as the fast-moving technology develops.      According to the new report, the risks of ""existing and planned digital-asset arrangements"" could put financial-industry stability in peril ""via both direct and indirect connections with banking services, financial markets and financial intermediaries.""      The report also cited ""risks to consumers, investors and businesses associated with potential losses or instability in market prices"" along with ""illicit financial risks; risks to national security; cybersecurity and privacy risks; and risks to international monetary and payment system integrity.""

Neville, who co-founded the Boston-based payments firm in 2014 with Jeremy Allaire, said in an email obtained by CoinDesk that he notified the company’s Board of Directors during a quarterly meeting. While he will transition out of his role as co-CEO, he will remain on the board as an independent director.      While Neville did not explicitly give a reason for his departure, he said in his email that the company’s recent sale of the Poloniex crypto exchange was one of several factors that made “the time appropriate for me to transition.”      As part of Circle’s board, Neville expects to continue working with CENTRE, the collaboration between Circle and Coinbase which is nominally the issuer of the USDC stablecoin.      “I also expect to propel the mission forward through CENTRE and other new complementary paths that traverse worthwhile challenges in infrastructure, regulatory policy, economics, and product design,” he wrote. “As always, I remain stubbornly optimistic about our ability to devise and execute well-crafted things that improve our collective future.”      However, first Neville intends to take a sabbatical, though he did not provide a timeframe.      Circle was founded as a peer-to-peer payments firm, and became the first company to receive a BitLicense from the New York Department of Financial Services in 2015.
