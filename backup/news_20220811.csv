42374044,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXCUr,1660261503,"Coinbase's Credit Rating Gets Cut by S&P, Which Warns Crypto Winter Might Prompt More Reductions","In an already difficult week, Coinbase (COIN) suffered another knock as S&P Global Ratings cut the cryptocurrency exchange's credit rating and warned further reductions are possible given that crypto winter could linger.  S&P ratcheted down Coinbase's long-term issuer credit rating and senior unsecured debt ratings to BB from BB+ on Thursday, citing ""weak earnings and competitive pressure.""  Coinbase sold about $2 billion of junk-rated bonds last year, a sign of Wall Street's warmer embrace of crypto. Since then, crypto prices – and Coinbase's stock price – have fallen dramatically and pressure on the company to control costs has increased.  S&P now has a ""negative"" outlook for Coinbase's ratings, meaning the agency might announce more cuts.  ""Competitive risk has intensified in the crypto exchange sector, with the company's market share decreasing this year,"" S&P wrote. The more dire assessment reflects ""uncertainties about the duration of the crypto market downturn,"" questions around Coinbase's ability to manage costs and ""the potential for further market share deterioration amid a challenging competitive landscape as well as heightened regulatory risk.""  Coinbase shares closed Thursday at $84 per share, down more than 10% for the day. Its shares reached a high of over $350 last fall.  S&P's note comes two days after Coinbase reported a nearly 30% decline in trading volume from $309 million in the first three months of 2022 to $217 million in its second quarter, and missed consensus revenue expectations. The exchange posted a net loss of $1.1 billion during the quarter, versus a $430 million loss in the first quarter.  In its quarterly report, Coinbase disclosed that it is under investigation by U.S. securities regulators over its token listing processes as well as its staking programs and yield-generating products.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/11/coinbase-outlook-negative-credit-ratings-agency-sp-global-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8aca1978f7065178d2d08a3bedd41f2f05fbc21c-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374053,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXCgB,1660254635,Snapple Created a Bodega in the Metaverse,"There’s a new bodega in the metaverse game Decentraland, and the sugary beverage company Snapple is behind it.  The virtual New York City-style corner store was erected by Snapple in the metaverse on Wednesday, bodega cat included. CoinDesk visited Thursday, perusing the pixelated aisles and on a scavenger hunt for flying chopped cheeses and Snapple bottle caps.  The entire installation is a self-proclaimed advertisement for Snapple’s newest “Elements” drink collection. Buying the bottles has Web3 upside, too: Each IRL drink comes with a code to claim a non-fungible token (NFT) wearable, according to the company’s website.  One part of the in-game scavenger yielded a $1.39 rebate code for buyers of the drink. Ironically, the real-life discount snubs crypto, telling users they must link their PayPal accounts to cash in.  It’s not the first time a company has aped into Decentraland as a promotional medium. The Australian Open created a tennis-themed pop-up for last January’s tournament. Bud Light unveiled its own metaverse bar around Super Bowl Sunday; JPMorgan’s virtual lounge opened a few weeks later.  It’s also not Snapple’s first dive into Web3. The company partnered with the Tezos and Polygon-based NFT platform OneOf to release its debut collection last May, the first effort in what now appears to be a larger campaign targeted at crypto-curious beverage drinkers.  Part of the bodega’s marketing also includes partnerships with popular Twitch streamers, who have been active promoters of the installation on social media.  Promotions like Snapple’s have been mostly met with groans from the metaverse-native, but as the idea of Web3 treks forward into the mainstream it’s likely these installations will only become more common.

42421126,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZUbt,1660253741,Rune Christensen Details How MakerDAO Is Navigating Tornado Cash Sanctions,"The decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem should prepare itself for a more adversarial relationship with regulators, warned Rune Christensen, founder of MakerDAO, the decentralized autonomous organization behind the DAI stablecoin.  Christensen told CoinDesk TV on Thursday the U.S. Treasury Department's sanctioning coin mixer Tornado Cash may be ushering in “a new era for DeFi.” On Monday, the agency designated this Tornado Cash, a critical component of the Ethereum ecosystem, as a “national security risk.” The announcement almost immediately cast a large shadow over the crypto industry.  The Treasury move “opened the door to the possibility of any protocol getting a sanction,” Christensen said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” show. Because Tornado was at the center of so much economic activity on the Ethereum blockchain, DeFi apps now need to look at their exposure to Tornado and potentially change course.  “Decentralization has been more of a meme than reality for many projects,” Christensen said.  This week, members of the MakerDAO community began preparing a “contingency plan” in case its “core” wallets are affected by the sanction. Of particular concern is the large amount of USDC, a stablecoin issued by the regulatory-compliant Centre Consortium. Maker holds USDC as collateral on DAI, its U.S. dollar-denominated cryptocurrency.  Circle, one of the entities behind USDC, immediately blacklisted 38 Ethereum addresses to comply with the Treasury’s sanction, while a host of so-called permissionless apps like dYdX, Aave and others have begun freezing user’s funds if there is even a marginal connection to Tornado.  This increases the pressure on Maker, Christensen said. Maker allows anyone to mint DAI by lending cryptocurrencies to the application. More than a third of DAI is backed by USDC, while about a quarter of its reserves are in ether (ETH). If that ETH or USDC is found to have interacted with Tornado, it could be frozen – leaving Maker with a shortfall.  Christensen said regulated stablecoins like USDC have “proliferated” across DeFi because they were very safe, liquid and easy to integrate. But there’s a natural “tension” between “centralized” stablecoins and projects like DAI that want to be permissionless and uncensorable.  The decision to lean on USDC allowed Maker to grow and focus on an easy user experience, but it came with “tradeoffs” that are now fully visible, Christensen said.  Sanctioning smart contracts  This is not the first time regulators have blocked access to a crypto mixing service. However, they typically have targeted specific individuals or entities behind an application or specific users.  Christensen said the decision to sanction a smart contract was “useless and pointless,” in that it will be impossible for the government to enforce its ban.  “Now we know that it’s possible to simply sanction an Ethereum address,” he said. Though it’s doubtful the government will target specific DeFi applications or stablecoin issuers like Maker, he is concerned about the “second order” effects.  “We don't really know if we can really rely on working closely with governments in the long run, which has so far really been the strategy of major DeFi projects like Maker,” he said.  In a move to tether DeFi to the larger, traditional economy, MakerDAO has been working to integrate what it calls “real world assets.” This includes getting into the mortgage industry, and also potentially allowing people to collateralize non-crypto assets.  Christensen said the sanction has put a “spanner in the works” of some of these efforts, as Maker’s U.S. legal partners have become concerned about new potential criminal liability.  “They don’t want to get caught up in sanctions enforcement,” he said, without naming these partners. “They’re slowing down deals” and redoubling efforts on compliance and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations.  Down the pike  Christensen said a more aggressive regulatory regime could push DeFi to further decentralize. While the first “era” of DeFi was about building and deploying quickly, the next will be about building in redundancy and robustness.  “Stablecoins can choose to be more decentralized and the market will accept it to counter the cost of stability around that,” he said.  As something of an extreme fail-safe measure, Christensen has floated the idea of depegging DAI from the U.S. dollar. He said Maker could even move to have the vast majority (upwards of 75%) of its treasury held in ETH, which after the Merge could be a “very attractive” and fairly stable asset that pays dividends.  “The ultimate consequence would be that it’s simply not possible to have a decentralized stablecoin that’s pegged to the U.S. dollar,” he said. On the other hand, it could mean that stablecoins that are pegged to the dollar are “a lot more regulated.”  Ultimately, it’s up to the DAO to decide on what course of action to take. He noted some community members are growing increasingly skeptical about plans to integrate “real world assets.”  But even in this new era, the crypto industry has the responsibility of “convincing” politicians and investors alike that crypto is a valuable asset, or “a force for good.” One way of showing that “crypto can actually benefit the economy,” Christensen said, would be to take action on climate concerns or entering the real estate market.  The worst case scenario, however, or “final boss bottle,” as he put it, rests on the possibility that governments around the world come together to implement sweeping regulation that “shuts down crypto for good.”  “They won’t succeed, but the degree of success will depend on how much DeFi and crypto prepare for this,” he said.

42374057,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXCjx,1660250998,"Crypto Miner Core Scientific Cuts 10% of Staff, Keeps Hashrate Projection","Crypto miner Core Scientific (CORZ) cut 10% of its staff and dramatically reduced the value of its assets as the cryptocurrency rout continued to drag on the industry.  The workforce reduction was announced Thursday as the company reported its second-quarter financial results, which included an $840 million charge to reduce the accounting value of its assets that took the Core's net loss for the period to $862 million.  CFO Denise Sterling said during the earning conference call that the staff cuts were ""surgical"" and didn't affect operational personnel in Core Scientific's data centers.  Like other bitcoin miners amid the crypto winter, the company has been forced to shore up its liquidity. In July, Core sold more bitcoin than it mined, in part to keep up with costs.  However, Core stuck with its forecast for the company's hashrate, a measure of computing power on the Bitcoin network and a key metric for mining companies. On May 12, Core Scientific lowered its 2022 hashrate projection to 30-32 exahash per second and total power of about 1 gigawatt, citing market turmoil. The company retained that forecast Thursday.  The miner reported $164 million in revenue, narrowly beating the average analyst estimate of $161.8 million, according to FactSet data. Revenue more than doubled from a year earlier, driven by ""increases in digital asset mining revenue and hosting revenue, partially offset by a decrease in equipment sales,"" the earnings report said.  CEO Mike Levitt said during the earnings call that two-thirds of the company's 2022 growth is set to take place in the second half of the year.  But the miner's personnel and facilities costs have also climbed by 25% compared to last year, while their power cost has reached $0.05-$0.055 per kilowatt hour.  Answering several questions from concerned analysts about the company raised its power-cost expectations for the year, Levitt pointed to the company's Georgia facility, where Core faces the greatest exposure to rising natural gas prices. The miner is trying to get a better arrangement with its energy provider, the CEO said. The miner is also thinking about scaling up its operations such that economies of scale bring down unit costs.  Revenue streams  The company mines bitcoin for itself while also hosting other companies’ bitcoin mining machines. Revenue from hosting was up 110% compared with a year earlier, while self-mining revenue rose 920%.  Hosting is in high demand after available rack space dwindled. But Levitt noted that ""a lot of folks that don't have a home for their mining equipment also don't have capital"" and Core is only interested in working with clients who can make prepayments and are ""very, very credit worthy.""  At the same time, Core has had to re-examine the profitability of its hosting business, the CEO said.  ""In the good old days, we used to be a reseller of servers, and there was margin in that,"" Levitt said. ""We could look at the margin of that, and combine that with our hosting agreements, and look at the overall profitability. Now that we really don't have a very vibrant reseller business, because most folks are going direct to the manufacturers. Our hosting business needs to stand on its own two feet,"" he said.  Core produced 3,365 bitcoin for itself and, as of the end of the quarter, it holds 1,959 bitcoins in its reserve.  Shares of the miner fell about 1% following the report. The stock has fallen about 68% this year, in-line with its bitcoin mining peers as bitcoin price fell nearly 50%.

42374063,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXCrV,1660250814,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Price Rises but Ether Outpaces as Merge Nears,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price rose 2% in Thursday morning trading and held those gains throughout the day. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization remains above $24,000.  Ether’s (ETH) price climbed 4%. ETH’s push higher occurred on higher than average trading volume when compared to its 20-day moving average.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  As highlighted in Thursday morning’s First Mover Americas, Ether prices rose following the third and final dress rehearsal on Ethereum’s Goerli testing blockchain ahead of the eagerly anticipated Merge. The test’s success brought the Ethereum blockchain one step closer to converting from proof-of-work to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake protocol.  Many Ethereum observers expect the conversion to proof-of-stake to have a deflationary effect on the supply of ETH, thereby slowing the rate at which the supply of the asset increases. Historically, a reduction of supply for any asset pushes its overall value higher.  Additionally, the move to proof-of-stake will allow ETH holders to generate cash flows by “staking” their ETH and earning rewards.  Traditional markets were mixed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.1% while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite declined 0.03% and 0.5%  In commodities, the price of crude oil was trading 2.2% higher while gold, a traditional safe haven asset during stressful economic times, declined by 0.6%.  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $24,164 +1.9%      ●Ether (ETH): $1,896 +3.9%      ●S&P 500 daily close: 4,207.27 −0.1%      ●Gold: $1,804 per troy ounce +0.4%      ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.89% +0.1       Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Throughout BTC’s Recent Rise, ETH Has Been the Stronger Performer  Instead of looking at the bitcoin price movement in U.S. dollar terms, today’s chart considers ether prices relative to BTC.  Notably, ETH prices in BTC terms have increased 41% since July 13. The move higher has come on average volume, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI is a proxy for momentum) has increased from 45.89 to its current 70.57. An RSI level of 50 is considered neutral, whereas a level in excess of 70 traditionally implies that the asset is “overbought.” An overbought reading implies that the magnitude of change in an asset has taken it past its fair market value, thereby making it a candidate to be sold.  Moreover, the 50-period exponential moving average (EMA) for the ETH/BTC pair crossed its 200-period EMA, completing a “golden cross.”  In technical terms, a golden cross occurs when the shorter term 50-day EMA crosses the longer-term 200 EMA, and is viewed as a precursor to a bull market. In this case, the signal implies that ETH is poised to outperform BTC.  The upcoming Ethereum Merge bears mention with this chart pattern because investors may be moving into ETH in anticipation of its completion. The question remains whether the move higher is a long-term development to a structural change or a short-term reaction to an upcoming event. If it is the latter, investors may be inclined to take profits in September, when the Merge is scheduled to occur.  Investors should consider past RSI levels above 70 and subsequent price behavior shortly after. The above chart highlights four past instances since May 2021 of the RSI reaching overbought levels.  The performance of ETH relative to BTC 30 days after each occurrence was -13%, -5%, -16%, and -3%, respectively. Since the most recent overbought reading (July 18), ETH prices are 11% higher, which appears to be an anomaly from past performance.  Not surprisingly, BTC’s market cap dominance has declined recently  While still the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, in recent weeks bitcoin has lost some of its dominance to ETH as the Merge date nears.  The “bitcoin dominance” chart highlights the decline.

42411417,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNeEH,1660247813,How DeFi Can Deliver Value for Artists and Musicians,"When the crypto community discusses DeFi (decentralized finance), the term is often pigeonholed to finance.  What was once a space for creatives, engineers and tinkerers has instead become a battleground for venture capital firms and hedge funds who use DeFi to take on unprecedented volumes of leverage at the expense of retail investors (as we saw with the collapse of Terra and Celsius).  Even non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are starting to be treated as their own separate category within Web3, belonging more to the art and entertainment industries – as institutions like Sotheby’s and Universal enter – than the original ecosystem of smart contracts they emerged from.  Matt Waters is the founder of Unchained Music, a 100% free music distribution project that uses Charged Particles DeFi NFTs to provide a no-loss solution to artists.  Blockchain founders need to return to the space’s roots of decentralization, while using “DeFi” as a guiding ethos to introduce smart contracts and new incentive structures into legacy industries.  An all-too-familiar story  The music industry is notorious for short-changing artists. In what has become an all-too-familiar story, a musician creates a song that shapes culture, only to have distributors and middlemen profit from their talent, leaving the original creator with few, if any, royalties. Taylor Swift, indie bands, rappers from the East Coast to the West: It seems as though every artist is destined to fall into the same trap from the same vested interest groups. While streaming services were intended to democratize the industry, allowing talent to explode without gatekeepers, artists still see few royalties from the value they create – essentially functioning as “content creators” for tech platforms, in exchange for distribution privileges.  DeFi, not just blockchain, can introduce new incentive structures that re-emphasize the role of the artist. Rather than fractionalizing NFTs (which would make them securities), DeFi infrastructure can provide artists new tools for receiving royalties, including compounding interest accounts and on-chain transparency regarding where their royalties go. A number of great Web3 projects, such as MODA DAO, are looking to remove middlemen altogether so artists can publish decentrally. As the trend toward decentralization continues, NFTs will be a core technology pushing DeFi into the entertainment industry, allowing the deposit of stablecoins, with compounding mechanisms via protocols like AAVE.  Let the best protocol triumph  As the ecosystem has evolved since the “DeFi summer” of 2020 that ushered in the meteoric rise of Chainlink (while mainstreaming lockups and liquidity pools), certain protocols have fared better than others, and the industry has a rough idea of which blockchains and integrations are adoptable. While it is disconcerting to see how hedge funds have colonized DeFi (especially as industry talking-points center on providing financial services to the “unbanked”), there is a silver lining to all the protocol exploits and liquidated leverage: Only the best tech survives.  Artists are often the earliest adopters and promoters of good tech. As a CoinDesk column noted during the publication’s Sports Week series recently, Dr. Dre drove mass adoption of his Beats by Dre headphones by collaborating with NBA players and other celebrities. Likewise, Dre protégés Snoop Dogg and Eminem furthered the role of NFTs in popular culture, with a music video featuring their Bored Apes from BAYC as cartoon characters crisscrossing California. Dr. Dre has also announced plans to build Death Row Records as the first NFT music label in the Metaverse.  The great thing about technology that has triumphed through Darwinistic trial-and-error conditions is that it feels seamless. Artists don’t necessarily need to speak on the nuances of underlying protocol architecture to know when something works seamlessly – few musicians can articulate the audio output of a Funktion-One or Dragonfire Acoustics system, but know it’s a sound that's superior to the rest.  From the ashes of the current market meltdown comes a beautiful melody. It sounds something like “AA-VE.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | LINK | TECHNOLOGY,Matt Waters ,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/08/11/how-defi-can-deliver-value-for-artists-and-musicians,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/baffaa93c7152cc97f8127a360744c7ef804bd1f-5233x3489.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin aSOPR Fails Retest Of The &apos;Value=1&apos; Line As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC aSOPR has been rejected from the breakeven mark recently. The &apos;Spent Output Profit Ratio&apos; (or SOPR in short) is an indicator that tells us whether Bitcoin investors are selling at a loss or at a profit right now. The metric works by looking at the on-chain history of each coin being sold to see what price it was last moved at. If the previous selling price of any coin was less than the current value of BTC, then that particular coin has just been sold at a profit. While if it&apos;s otherwise, then the coin realized some loss. Related Reading: Ethereum Investors Close 300k Long Positions on Bitfinex, Rally To Stop Soon?

42421837,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwAOb,1660243653,How to Buy and Sell NFTs on LooksRare,"LooksRare is one of the many non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces that run on the Ethereum blockchain. The developers behind the platform, launched in January, have said they want to build “something better” than competitors, including Bored Ape behemoth OpenSea.  LooksRare bills itself as a platform “by NFT people, for NFT people” and uses reward mechanisms and special listing options to lure users from competitors.  It offers free LOOKS tokens for engagement, and the LooksRare team continues to roll out features meant to enhance the NFT trading experience.  LooksRare has yet to match OpenSea’s market capitalization but it has attracted a lot of attention for its emphasis on community and its unique engagement incentives. Here's how it works.  What is LooksRare?  LooksRare is an Ethereum-based NFT marketplace that allows users to buy or sell NFTs to earn rewards in the form of its native utility tokens LOOKS. The platform has a standard 2% sales fee on all NFT sales, which is slightly lower than OpenSea’s 2.5%.  The LOOKS token is central to the LooksRare ecosystem and can be staked to receive shares of daily trading fees, received in LOOKS and wrapped ether (wETH).  To entice new users during its launch, LooksRare airdropped a supply of 120 million LOOKS to anyone who traded over 3 ETH on OpenSea between June and December of 2021. To claim their LOOKS, users had to list at least one NFT on LooksRare. This resulted in a flood of new listings to the site and a first-day trading volume of $105 million. In addition, nearly $2 million in platform fees were generated and distributed to LOOKS stakers.  The platform was co-founded by the pseudonymous “Zodd” and “Guts” and now has a team of 22 staff across the globe, although there is still some mystery surrounding its operations.  How to buy NFTs on LooksRare  LooksRare offers connection to three Ethereum-compatible wallets including MetaMask, WalletConnect and Coinbase Wallet.  To get started, click the “Connect” button on LooksRare’s homepage to link your preferred crypto wallet.  After your wallet is connected to LooksRare you can use the “Explore” or “Collections” tabs to see what NFTs are available.  When you find an NFT you like, you can click on it to view more details. If the NFT you’re looking at is up for sale, you could make an offer with ETH or wETH.  As a bonus, LooksRare allows users to place a “Collections Offer” if they don’t mind which NFT they get. For example, if you’re interested in getting a Mutant Ape NFT, you could place a “Collections Offer” on the Mutant Ape Yacht Club page. Once you submit your offer, anyone who holds a Mutant Ape NFT could agree to sell their NFT to you for your offer price.  To account for Ethereum gas fees, make sure your wallet has enough funds when making an offer to ensure a successful transaction.  How to sell NFTs on LooksRare  After connecting a wallet, click the “List an NFT” button on the homepage, which will bring you to a screen showing all of the NFTs held in your wallet. You can click “Sell” on any of the NFTs you wish to list on the LooksRare platform and set a fixed price and the number of days you want the listing to be active.  A new feature called ""Conditional Listing"" was recently added that allows users to list two items; when one item sells, the other listing is canceled and automatically returned to the seller's wallet.  For those who want to mint an NFT collection directly on LooksRare, the platform offers access to third-party service Manifold Studio. Under the wallet icon, users will find a “Create a Collection” button, which will launch Manifold Studios’ website in another tab.  You can connect your wallet to Manifold Studio and import any images, audio tracks or videos you’d like to create as an NFT before launching it on LooksRare.  As a bonus, LooksRare offers royalties on-chain, meaning that whenever a sale is made through LooksRare, royalties are paid in the same transaction as the sale, giving creators instant payouts.  How to stake LOOKS tokens  Users can also earn passive income with $LOOKS tokens through staking. The process allows users to earn additional LOOKS on top of the trading fee rewards received in wETH.  To begin staking LOOKS, click the “Rewards” tab on LooksRare’s homepage.  Users have the option of ""standard staking"" their tokens for additional LOOKS and wETH, or they can choose to auto-compound their staked tokens, meaning that rewards received are automatically re-staked into the pool and users do not need to manually stake their tokens to increase their share.  The amount of staking rewards you receive can fluctuate, and depends on multiple factors, including the average daily trading volume and whether you choose to compound your staked tokens. Users also have the option of buying LOOKS tokens on crypto exchanges like Uniswap.  When users unstake their tokens, the amount of compounded rewards and the original staked amount will be added to a user's wallet.  Reports of wash trading  While LooksRare is often touted for its reward and staking mechanisms, data compiled by NFT tracker CryptoSlam in April suggested that about $18 billion of the trading volume on the platform, or about 95% of the total activity, has been linked to wash trading.  Wash trading is a way for sellers to manipulate the market, often by buying and selling to themselves in order to make it seem as though an asset is in high demand. In LooksRare's case, the rewards system may incentivize users to manipulate sales in order to gain LOOKS tokens. Wash trading is illegal under U.S. law and remains difficult to track in the crypto space.  Ultimately, the choice of whether to buy and sell NFTs on LooksRare or other Ethereum-based marketplaces like OpenSea, SuperRare or Rarible is a matter of personal preference. Users should do their own research and consider the benefits and risks of each platform.

42411425,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNeej,1660243032,"Web2 'Delenda Est,' You Say?","Decrypt reported that email service provider Mailchimp has kicked two crypto-related newsletters off its platform, the latest in a long string of suspensions dating back to at least 2018.  Ryan Selkis’ Unqualified Opinions, a daily roundup of insights gleaned from his crypto data firm Messari, and a marketing/announcements newsletter by wallet provider Edge, have been deplatformed.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  ""Thank you for [d]eplatforming some of crypto's most reputable brands in the past 48 hours,"" Selkis tweeted at Mailchimp on Wednesday. ""You're proving our point. Mailchimp – and all speech censors – must be destroyed.""  Crypto occupies a perilous position within mainstream thought. On one hand, it’s the frontier of finance and technology, the new “disruptor” that can shake up our old sclerotic institutions.  See also: Ethereum's Political Philosophy Explained | Opinion  On the other hand, it’s an industry that is rightfully vilified as an abyss of scams and scammers. It empties pockets, devours electricity and spreads like a virus. It has promised much, but delivered little beyond increasingly convoluted buzzwords and self-justifications.  And so, the public understanding of crypto is all over the place. Media coverage of the industry is downright schizo – the same publication that could publish a headline like “This mom quit her job to focus on crypto full time and build ‘generational wealth” will turn around and call crypto dead the next month.  It’s never exactly surprising when companies like Mailchimp, which is owned by the tax software giant Intuit, take a stand against crypto. Especially when some of the industry’s loudest promoters have become its harshest critics, with shifting allegiances seemingly based on bitcoin’s price.  Selkis criticized Mailchimp for the abrupt about-face, and from a business perspective he is probably right to say its action was unprofessional. He’s sent an email just about every weekday for the past four years using the email service, and now cannot even access his subscriber list. He says he was given no forewarning or justification.  Others also booted  It’s a similar story for others – including NFT (non-fungible token) artists Jesse Friedland and Ocarina as well as Greg Osuri, founder of Akash Network, a cloud computing platform – who were also recently booted by Mailchimp.  In the interest of objectivity, however, Mailchimp’s acceptable use policy clearly lists “cryptocurrencies, virtual currencies and any digital assets related to an initial coin offering” as “prohibited content.” And it has a history of enforcing that policy. It has denied services to media companies Decrypt, Breaker and Blockworks as well as to crypto exchange ShapeShift.  People in crypto often use those examples of “censorship” as justification for the work they’re doing or support. If anyone can get thrown off of an email service, or “shadowbanned” by Twitter, then the need for freely accessible, permissionless systems is self-evident. Or as Selkis said, recalling the great battles of empire between Rome and Carthage, “Web2 delenda est” (it must be destroyed).  Moments like this can certainly act as cautionary tales, but they are also useful reminders that crypto isn’t really owed anything by anyone. An industry that is often rightfully accused of writing its own rules can’t really call foul when caught cheating another man’s game.  True, it’s depressing that anti-crypto slacktivists can scuttle crypto projects at places like Wikipedia or the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), two organizations that ought to stand with crypto’s open-source ethos. But can you fault other companies for wanting to mitigate risk and limit their associations with crypto?  See also: ‘Probably Nothing’: Why People Still Hate Crypto | Opinion  Web3 apparently has a fix for all of Web2’s flaws. There are crypto-native publishing platforms, competing social media sites, etc. Legacy brands that see an actual business case in crypto are moving in that direction, testing the waters. (Tiffany, Reddit and BlackRock all recently announced major blockchain initiatives.)  I see little benefit in defending the view that crypto has to “Trojan Horse” Web2 – taking advantage of these already established networks while seeking to undermine them. It is, to my mind, at least part of the reason why people are so confused about what crypto is.  Is crypto just this abstract thing you talk about on podcasts or emails or Discord? Or is it truly a seismic shift between powers? It would probably be clearer if crypto’s proponents actually used the platforms they proclaim to support.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | AKT | TOKEN SALE,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/08/11/web2-delenda-est-you-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6467f110ebd1f57f5e8811023fe4b11e7bcd918d-5790x4343.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The original catalyst behind the creation of cryptocurrencies, Buterin noted, was social change. Instead, millions of people have crypto wallets for a decidedly more whimsical purpose: “so they can trade monkey pictures,” he said Wednesday at the Blockchain Futurist Conference in Toronto.  Crypto’s pioneers pondered the “great battle between the authority of the nation-state and the desire for individual freedom,'' he said. Fast-forward to now and “It's like, ‘Hey, look, it's a monkey!’” he joked.  Read more: What's the Story Behind Bored Ape Yacht Club Creator Yuga Labs?  More seriously, Buterin believes this is an example of the double-edged sword of cryptography. “The problem with crypto space is that it has great incentives, but at the same time, it has incentives to go into very weird directions sometimes,” he said, noting the Ape NFTs.  This isn’t the first time Buterin has commented publicly about the utility of BAYC’s NFTs. During an interview with Time in March, he compared the immensely popular NFTs to gambling. He later clarified in a tweet that he doesn’t necessarily hate Ape NFTs, but rather he wants them to “fund public goods.”  Buterin was also very upbeat about the Ethereum Merge, an event that could take place next month that will dramatically change the underpinnings of the network, cutting energy consumption in the process.  Read more: Vitalik Buterin Discusses Ethereum's Upcoming 'Merge' and 'Surge' at EthCC in Paris  “Ethereum’s energy consumption [after the merge] will be reduced by more than 99.9%, so it’s a big improvement,” he said. “It's also an opportunity to kind of take some of the ideas that we've learned over the last eight years or so, and use that to really redefine what the different parts of the Ethereum chain [can do],” Buterin added.  Buterin’s optimism was reflected by the markets as well, with the network's native token ether (ETH) hitting the highest price since June as traders have become more bullish on the Merge.  Read more: Ether Tops $1.9K as Ethereum Runs Final 'Merge' Rehearsal  After the switch, Buterin said, the network could be made more secure, transactions sped up and costs lowered. It also opens Ethereum up to more upgrades in the future, he said. Buterin added that immediately after the Merge, the biggest focus will be on the scalability of the network.  Besides making the network consume less power, the rest of the benefits that Buterin talked about are still in the distant future. The third and final major milestone leading up to the Merge was achieved Wednesday with a test version of Ethereum.  Read more: Ethereum After the Merge: What Comes Next?

On Wednesday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) voted to advance a proposal that includes making private funds report crypto exposures on something called Form PF that gets submitted confidentially to regulators. The public will have 60 days to comment on the proposals, which go well beyond just crypto disclosures.  “I am pleased to support the proposal because, if adopted, it would improve the quality of the information we receive from all Form PF filers, with a particular focus on large hedge fund advisers,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement. “That will help protect investors and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets.”  The SEC and CFTC are mounting this effort in part because of the fast growth of private investment vehicles, which play a larger role in finance now, yet face less disclosure requirements than more conventional things like mutual funds. And the decision comes as big players in traditional finance keep moving into crypto, increasing the desire among regulators to keep tabs on who owns what and how much.  Although the proposal is the direct result of an agreement from January, and the crypto reporting requirement is one of several amendments aimed at broadly improving regulatory oversight of private funds and fund managers, it adds to a growing list of efforts from regulators around the world to tighten their grip over crypto.  Read more: Why the Crypto Crash Will Accelerate Regulatory Action  Indeed, the recent turbulence in crypto markets – which wiped out trillions of dollars from the industry and blew up several high-flying companies – has made it tough for regulators to look away.  That’s not to say all regulators are behind making private funds disclose more, though. A number of senior CFTC and SEC officials have come forward to say the proposed reporting requirements may be excessive. Their comments were broad critiques of the plan, not just focused on the crypto portion.  SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, also known as “crypto mom,” wrote a lengthy letter detailing why the amendments to Form PF were not what she had in mind.  CFTC Commissioner, Summer K. Mersinger said she does not support the proposal. “Data and information that federal regulators request from market participants should be narrowly tailored to the purpose intended under our governing statutes, and unfortunately, that does not appear to be the overall approach in this proposal,” she wrote.

42374070,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXGKd,1660232309,Ethereum’s Merge Now Has Tentative September Dates,"It now looks even more likely the major Ethereum overhaul known as the Merge will take place in September.  Ethereum developers discussed potential dates for the long-awaited Merge, when the Ethereum blockchain makes its move to proof-of-stake from proof-of-work, during a Consensus Layer call Thursday.  A document circulated among Ethereum developers during the call that showed there could be several scenarios for when the Merge on the Ethereum mainnet might occur. Likely dates include Sept. 15, 16 or 20.  Most of the developers agreed they would aim to have the Bellatrix upgrade live around Sept. 6, 2022. Bellatrix is the name of the upgrade that will kick off the process of the Merge and set everything in motion.  There will be a 14-day period between the Bellatrix upgrade and the mainnet Merge. That's the length of time that will pass before the network reaches a specific total terminal difficulty (TTD) which, in turn, will activate the Merge. The tentative TTD mark is 58,750,000,000,000,000,000,000. Nothing is final, however, until it’s codified in a client release.  The first scenario described in the document began with a Bellatrix upgrade on Sept. 1, with the Merge happening two weeks later on (or around) Sept. 15. The second scenario would see Bellatrix upgraded on Sept. 6, with the Merge happening on (or around) Sept. 20. Given that the preferred Bellatrix upgrade date is Sept. 6, the second scenario is more likely.  But there was discussion about reaching a compromise among developers and speeding up the hashrate, meaning that if Bellatrix takes effect on Sept. 6, the Merge could happen around Sept. 16. Developers agreed that they don’t want the Merge to happen on a weekend, so they will now think it over and re-discuss these dates and estimations next week on their All-Core Developers call.  Revisiting the Goerli testnet merge  At the beginning of the call, developers briefly went over the Goerli testnet merge that occurred early Thursday morning at 01:45 UTC. Developers agreed that it was a successful merge and that the network is healthy, even though the participation rate did drop briefly to 70%; it has since gone back up. Ethereum developer, Parithosh Jayanthi, told CoinDesk why there was a drop in participation:  “The roughly 15%-16% drop was due to configuration issues. The rest was in a fork due to two terminal blocks.” Parithosh explained that the fork was able to resolve itself after about 128 slots, due to a mode called the optimistic sync mode, which allows for the chain to sync up. “The other % came back online after the config issue was fixed. Now we’re at 84%.” Parithosh added.  For context, since December 2020 Ethereum has been testing transitions to proof-of-stake. Goerli was the last of three public testnets to run through its own merge ""dress rehearsal"" successfully. The Merge will make Ethereum more energy efficient, as the proof-of-stake protocol reduces energy consumption by 99.95%. This will not be the last project for Ethereum. Following the Merge, Ethereum will tackle scalability issues.

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) drifted up 1.9% to $24.52K as of shortly before 12:00 p.m. ET, as the broader stock market further advances on softer-than-expected inflation data. The token failed to take $24K three separate times during August, so it&apos;ll be interesting to see if the current breakout holds. The commodity-heavy producer price index unexpectedly fell 0.5% M/M in July, driven by a 9.0% drop in prices for final demand energy. That&apos;s on top of July&apos;s consumer price index coming in flat from a month before and below the consensus estimate. As some are speculating the peak in inflation is finally here, risk assets including cryptos and stocks could see &apos;some breathing room over the next month or so,&apos; Sotiriou wrote in a note. &apos;This is also the first bit of good news regarding the macro economy in months, so I think it will be well received, and allow Bitcoin to break above $26,000 in the following weeks.&apos;Speaking of equities, which have been strongly correlated with bitcoin (BTC-USD) in the past year, all three major U.S. stock indices extended their rally with the Dow Jones (DJI) +0.6%, the S&amp;P 500 (SP500) +0.4% and the tech-led Nasdaq (COMP.IND) +0.1%.

Bitcoin still hits a two-month high.  Market Moves: A Georgetown University law professor sounds an alarm on how the proof-of-stake protocol will make it easier for ether to be considered a security under the Howey Test. What could happen post-Merge?  Chart of The Day: Ether futures open interest hits a four-month high.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price point  Investors appeared more upbeat Thursday as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) both traded higher, extending gains after this week's cooler-than-expected U.S. inflation reading calmed fears of a more aggressive rate hike from the Federal Reserve.  “The inflation report has further fueled the optimism already apparent in the markets and could set the tone for the rest of the summer,” said Craig Erlam, Oanda analyst, in an emailed note.  ETH is outperforming BTC today, up 12% over the last 24 hours thanks to the successful third and final testnet on the Ethereum blockchain ahead of the Merge.  ""Goerli"" was the last of three public testnets to run through a dress rehearsal of the Merge, which will shift Ethereum from the current proof-of-work system to a proof-of-stake system. With Goerli done, the Merge is expected to take place at some point at the end of September. ETH has been rising ahead of it.  Bitcoin hit a two-month high of $24,658 on Thursday morning. Erlam wrote that he's “still not seeing the momentum I would expect and want.”  “That may change, of course, and a break of $25,000 could bring that, but we still appear to be seeing some apprehension that may hold it back in the near term,” according to Erlam.  In traditional markets, stock futures rose and the Nasdaq Composite, which includes big technology companies such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), rose into bull market territory Wednesday. The Nasdaq rose 2.9%, ending its longest bear market since 2008.  In the news, Near Protocol’s native NEAR token jumped 12% to a high of $5.97 Wednesday after Coinbase (COIN) added the token to its listing roadmap, which shows assets the cryptocurrency exchange plans to add.  Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic said that it can now track crypto movements across and between all blockchains concurrently and in a matter of milliseconds. The firm said the offering can help thwart exploits on cross-chain bridges.  From Seoul, South Korea, CoinDesk’s Shaurya Malwa reported that options trading is more likely to be a key bet among institutional investors in cryptocurrencies than other niches such as decentralized finance(DeFi) or non-fungible tokens (NFT) in the coming years, says prominent crypto fund QCP Capital.

By Frederick Munawa  Ethereum’s upcoming Merge could make the second-largest blockchain greener, faster and cheaper. But a law professor says it could also create regulatory headaches by transforming ether, the network’s native asset, into a security under U.S. law.  “After the Merge, there will be a strong case that ether will be a security. The token in any proof-of-stake system is likely to be a security,” tweeted Georgetown Law professor Adam Levitin on July 23.  If Levitin is right, and, more importantly, if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shares his view, exchanges that list ether (and that would be nearly all of them) would be subject to more onerous regulatory requirements. Like the bitcoin cryptocurrency, ether has until now been treated as a commodity, outside the SEC’s jurisdiction.  Most chatter in the Ethereum ecosystem has concerned technical aspects of a post-Merge proof-of-stake network rather than such legal questions. Goerli, a software update that took place late Wednesday Eastern time, is the final test before the second-largest blockchain fully transitions from the more energy-intensive proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. The switch is expected to be complete by October.  Levitin’s argument is anchored in the Howey Test – detailed in a 1946 U.S. Supreme Court ruling often used to determine whether an asset is a security. To fully appreciate Levitin’s perspective, it’s important to understand Howey and the concept of staking in a proof-of-stake system.  Read the full story here.

42421828,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwAIP,1660228127,The Top ‘Ethereum Killers’ Compared,"Crypto investors have likely noticed the drastic price drops and bearish sentiment detectable throughout the crypto market.  Yet crypto industry insiders remain optimistic – at least from a long-term perspective – and embrace this moment as somewhat of a race to see which blockchain projects survive and become leaders in a decentralized future.  Among the most epic rivalries in the wild, wild crypto west are those between Ethereum – the original smart contract blockchain – and the projects created to improve upon Ethereum’s technology.  Ethereum’s native currency, ether (ETH), had a market cap of roughly $229.12 billion at the time of this writing. The Ethereum network is heading steadily towards the Merge, which will move the blockchain from the current proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake model that will offer improved processing times, lower fees and more scalability.  Until then, so-called “Ethereum killers” are building up momentum and occupying a growing share of the non-fungible token (NFT) market, although Ethereum still maintains the lion's share of NFT transactions. Notably, these new blockchains seem to be doing it all with faster, environmentally cleaner technology and with lower transaction fees (aka “gas fees”), making some wonder how much longer Ethereum can hold onto its first mover advantage.  “The year 2022 will be the battle for Web3 and the next evolution of the internet,” says Ian Balina, founder of the crypto analytics firm Token Metrics. “Look for a heated race.”  So how do Ethereum’s competitors stack up?  Ethereum’s top competitors  “Ethereum is the clear leader,” Balina tells CoinDesk, “but these other blockchains are on-boarding new users at a faster pace due to Ethereum’s high gas fees and low transaction speed.”  Four of the top “Ethereum killers” today are Solana, Cardano, Tezos and Polkadot. Let’s take a look at each.  Solana  Solana’s native currency, SOL, had a market cap of $15.79 billion at the time of this writing.  Solana uses ""proof-of-history"" to validate transactions, as opposed to Ethereum’s proof-of-work consensus model. Large institutions such as JPMorgan and Bank of America have expressed their confidence in Solana, even saying it could become the “Visa of the digital asset ecosystem.”  Solana is also backed by top venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz – which isn’t always considered a good thing in the world of Web 3. Too much institutional interest could raise the eyebrows of decentralization diehards. Meanwhile, Ethereum has a loyal user base that many suspect won’t abandon it.  Nonetheless, Solana transacts at lightning speeds, and fees equate to a fraction of a cent per transaction. Since launching in 2020, it has experienced strong adoption and settled more than 50 billion transactions. Perhaps the most appropriate way to view Solana is as a potentially more mainstream Ethereum.  Cardano  Cardano is a contender for a more environmentally sustainable alternative to Ethereum. Its native currency, ADA, had about a $18.25 billion market cap at the time of this writing. Crypto insiders are keeping an eye on Cadano, which has performed modestly, because of the recent release of Cardano’s first decentralized finance (DeFi) exchange, SundaeSwap.  Time will tell whether Cardano can unseat Ethereum, or if similar learning curves will occur as more users transact on the Cardano blockchain.  See Also: How to Stake Cardano  Tezos  Coming fast on the scene is Tezos, another smart contract-capable blockchain used to issue new digital assets and create decentralized applications, or dapps. XTZ is the native cryptocurrency of Tezos. The currency had a market cap of $1.73 billion at the time of this writing.  Several notable projects have launched on Tezos, including those in the fashion, music, gaming and art industries. Tezos was one of the first networks to use a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. It also has unique governance features built in: Participants who stake at least 8,000 tokens on the network receive voting rights, which allow them to have a say in its governance. Tezos is also known for its dapp security.  Polkadot  DOT is the native cryptocurrency of the Polkadot platform. It had a market cap of $11.01 billion at the time of this writing.  Polkadot is known for a feature called “interoperability.” Its infrastructure connects several blockchains together into a single network, enabling them to exchange data without compromising their security. Interoperability is therefore essential for the future of Web3, in which services, products and currency will move throughout what many hope will be a decentralized digital ecosystem. Robust interoperability also creates the possibility for cross-chain collaboration, potentially leading to more collaboration among protocols.  Bottom line  Among smart contract blockchains, Ethereum still occupies the hearts of Web3 veterans and poses a strong possibility for widespread adoption. However, investors and advisors alike should stay informed about newer smart contract blockchains that present innovative solutions to Ethereum’s shortcomings. As the demand for new dapps and DeFi protocols increases, everyone will be looking for the right infrastructure to use to build the future of Web3.

42374082,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXGaz,1660227252,Polkadot Now Has a Decentralized Version of 'Wrapped' Bitcoin,"Interlay, a decentralized stablecoin network, has launched InterBTC (iBTC) – a wrapped bitcoin token. Wrapped tokens are synthetic (or tokenized) versions of crypto assets not native to the blockchains they exist on. iBTC was launched on Polkadot, a network that allows different blockchains to communicate with each other. One iBTC can be redeemed directly on the Bitcoin blockchain for one BTC (1:1 redemption ratio). The wrapped token allows bitcoin to be used for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on Polkadot via a bridge (a system connecting one blockchain to another).  Wrapped bitcoin  While several brands of wrapped bitcoin exist, the most popular one is an ERC-20 version aptly named wrapped bitcoin (wBTC). BitGo, Kyber and Ren created wBTC in 2019 and it now dominates the wrapped bitcoin market. According to Dune, a crypto data analytics site, wBTC accounts for almost 85% of all wrapped bitcoin on Ethereum.  Read more: What Are Wrapped Tokens?  The wBTC ecosystem has two key players – merchants and custodians. Users exchange regular bitcoin for wBTC with merchants like Kyber, Rhino.Fi (formerly DeversiFi) and Ren. Merchants have relationships with custodians who receive and hold that regular bitcoin and mint one wBTC for each bitcoin deposited with them. The minted wBTC token is sent to the user who can redeem the underlying bitcoin at any time. Redemption involves returning the wBTC token to the merchant, who then requests the bitcoin collateral from the custodian. Finally, the custodian burns the wBTC token and releases the bitcoin to the merchant and user.  What’s different about iBTC?  The traditional wBTC ecosystem has one glaring weakness – centralization. In order to obtain wBTC, users must give bitcoin custody to trusted third parties. Given the recent developments in the DeFi community, a more decentralized and trustless solution would be significantly better.  Interlay claims iBTC is that better solution. Apparently, iBTC is built on a trustless model that borrows its security from the token’s target blockchains (in this case, Bitcoin and Polkadot). The model uses decentralized vaults that hold collateral, instead of relying on third-party merchants and custodians.  How iBTC works  Interlay followed in MakerDAO’s footsteps by incorporating overcollateralized and decentralized vaults. The vaults are run by members of the Interlay community who must deposit multi-asset collateral (e.g. bitcoin, USDC, DOT) as insurance (in case the vault fails). According to Interlay, the overcollateralization gives iBTC a stablecoin-like quality (wrapped tokens and stablecoins have similar mechanics).  Users deposit bitcoin into the vaults in exchange for iBTC. At this point, the bitcoin is locked in the vault while vault collateral is locked by the Interlay network. Users then return iBTC to the vault, thereby unlocking and releasing their bitcoin, which triggers the Interlay network to release vault collateral. If a vault fails to return bitcoin to a user, the network liquidates vault collateral and reimburses the user.  Read more: How Does MakerDAO Work? Understanding the 'Central Bank of Crypto'  Acala, a stablecoin and trading platform, as well as Moonbeam, an Ethereum-compatible smart contract platform, are two Polkadot applications where iBTC can be used.

The UN Conference on Trade and Development, UNCTAD, warns that the rising use of crypto for domestic payments, and by migrant workers sending funds back home, challenges states' authority in monetary matters, and may cause “leakage” of development funds.  The agency advised imposing higher taxes on crypto transactions, requiring exchanges and wallets to register with regulators, and curbing or forbidding crypto ads.  “The benefits that cryptocurrencies may bring to some individuals and financial institutions are overshadowed by the risks and costs they entail, particularly in developing countries,” UNCTAD said, citing risks such as tax evasion and losses from price swings that might need to be bailed out by central banks.  The document advises countries to “ban regulated financial institutions from holding stablecoins and cryptocurrencies or offering related products to clients.”  Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that seek to maintain their value with respect to an established fiat currency such as the U.S. dollar – but they don’t always succeed, as the recent collapse of terraUSD showed.  Figures cited by UNCTAD show crypto is particularly popular in Russia, Ukraine and Venezuela, three countries affected by sanctions, war and hyperinflation. As of November 2021, 41 developing countries had either prohibited banks from dealing in crypto or prevented exchanges from offering crypto to retail investors, and nine have banned crypto outright, the report said.

The institutional investor-funded pool will provide borrowers with liquidity, a particularly valuable resource during a crypto bear market.  The Maven 11 pool will provide loans to crypto market makers, or large firms that provide enough money to exchanges to stabilize trading. In return, the lenders will receive yield from the market makers. Borrowers for the pool include Wintermute and Flow Traders, Maple originally listed Bastion, Nibbio and Folkvang Trading among the borrowers, but a spokesperson told CoinDesk after publication of this story that those companies aren't participating for now.“Maven 11 was the second pool delegate on the platform,” Maple CEO Sidney Powell told CoinDesk in an interview.  Maven 11 previously backed a Maple pool that lent wrapped ETH (wETH) that was more open and ""DeFi native,"" Powell said.  “They’ve fared particularly well over the recent volatility,"" Powell said. ""They’ve had no defaults to date, which means they’ve outperformed most of the CeFi (centralized finance) lenders.”  The new setup is permissioned with the know-your-customer/anti-money-laundering protections required for larger financial institutions.  Maple provides the blockchain-based technology to set up and maintain the pools. While all borrowers sign a standardized legal agreement that gives them access to loans, Maple leaves the underwriting to the lenders.  Celsius connection  In February, Maple unveiled a $30 million lending pool from Celsius Network, the crypto lending platform that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last month.  “The pools aren’t commingled, so if something goes wrong in a Celsius pool, it doesn’t impact the depositors in other pools. That’s one of the ways that risk is managed on the platform,” Powell said. “Celsius was lending its own funds. There were no outside depositors.”  Powell noted that the structure of Maple, which holds the loan money on its platform, would have meant that any theoretical outside depositor in the Celsius pool would have received his funds back before anyone else in the Celsius proceedings.  “My take is that there would’ve been fewer detrimental outcomes for depositors if more of CeFi’s business had actually been conducted using DeFi tools,” Powell said.  Institutional investors return  Institutional investors are coming back to the crypto market, Powell said,  “I think we saw a pullback in the appetite for counterparty risk,"" he said. ""What that manifested in was more of a push for collateralized lending, shifting away from uncollateralized or undercollateralized lending.”  Uncollateralized or undercollateralized lending is common in DeFi, where the usual anonymity of account holders prevents the equivalence of a credit check. Powell said those types of loans tend to favor more speculative businesses.  “Market makers typically wouldn’t borrow overcollateralized. What you saw is that their balance sheets shrunk, which meant less liquidity on exchanges,” he continued. “Now that the last quarter has come to a close, appetite is shifting back toward deploying and getting yield again. We’ve seen lending volumes are starting to grow. People are being enticed by price to come back into the market for stablecoin yields.”  UPDATE (13:40 UTC): Updates dollar amount in pool to $40 million based on fresh information from Maple.

42421831,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwALV,1660222548,What Is the Ethereum Merge?,"The “Merge” is intended to shift the Ethereum blockchain from the current proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model intended to be faster and more energy efficient. But adjusting the second-largest blockchain from one system to another is an incredibly complex, multi-step process. It’s important that each decision be assessed thoroughly. We’ll take you through the reasons and various stages leading to the protocol’s new chapter.  Read More: What Is Ethereum?  What is proof-of-stake and why is it needed?  In contrast to proof-of-work, which requires miners to compete for rewards based on the amount of computational power they can acquire, the proof-of-stake mechanism randomly selects validators relative to the total amount and time their ether (ETH) currency has been staked.  Unlike proof-of-work, PoS validators don't need to mine blocks to maintain the network. Instead, they need to create new blocks when chosen and validate others when not. Once a participant has validated the latest block of transactions, other contributors can attest (confirm) the block is valid. When enough attestations are made, the network adds a new block. Rewards are then distributed in ether, the blockchain's native currency, by the network in proportion to each validator's stake. However, to incentivize good behavior, there are also penalties (slashing) that can cause validators to lose a portion of their staked ETH if they go offline (fail to validate) or attest to malicious (bad) transactions.  Despite the high technical knowledge and expertise required to become a validator, anyone can join if they meet the minimum requirement of 32 ETH. People who can't meet the threshold can still contribute by staking ether in a pool (managed by third parties) and receive a portion of the rewards.  Read More: Ethereum After the Merge: What Comes Next?  While proof-of-work is reliable and secure, the comparative benefits of proof-of-stake include:  No requirement for advanced and expensive hardware like mining rigs  Much more efficient use of energy, according to the Ethereum Foundation  A lower risk of network centralization, which is a barrier to network security  The history of the Ethereum Merge  As evidenced by his early and later writings, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has been a long-time proponent of the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Compared with Ethereum's current resource-intensive PoW governance system, PoS is predicted to reduce energy consumption of the network by at least 99.95%.  It will also pave the way for shard chains in 2023, which are expected to nullify data congestion, high gas (transaction) fees, and support the next generation of layer 2 scaling systems. Shard chains provide extra, cheaper, storage layers for applications and rollups to store data, according to the Ethereum Foundation.  Unlike ERC standards, or traditional companies that enforce regulations from the top down, any major changes to the core protocol require consensus from the global community of nodes.  Because of the process all Ethereum updates and decisions go through, what some critics are calling undue delays have been, in reality, a laborious and carefully implemented consolidation of the network through steady, incremental upgrades and forks across several core elements: the Beacon Chain, the Merge and shard chains. Each of these rely on one another to realize the full vision for Ethereum of more scalability, security and sustainability.  As of writing, Buterin has said the Merge will happen in August. This is when the Beacon Chain (the component that controls PoS) will mark its official transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.  The role of the Beacon Chain and the Ethereum Merge  To increase the number of validators and process transactions using PoS, the Ethereum mainnet (which still uses proof-of-work) needs to merge with the Beacon Chain (otherwise known as the consensus layer).  Shipped on Dec. 1, 2020, at noon UTC, the Beacon Chain (which runs parallel to the mainnet, or live blockchain version) and currently has over 375,000 active validators, is the component responsible for controlling proof-of-stake.  It is also crucial in preparing Ethereum for the next multi-phase upgrade of shard chains, which will help expand the network's capacity to scale and store data. Although the original plan was to work on shard chains before the Merge, that has changed because of the accelerated growth of layer 2 scaling systems like Arbitrum, Optimism and Loopring. So most of the Ethereum community found the Merge and the transition to proof-of-stake to be a higher priority.  While the role of the Beacon Chain is expected to change over time, it will largely coordinate the network of shards and stakers. As the Beacon Chain cannot run smart contracts or handle accounts, the merging with the mainnet will bring this ability into the proof-of-stake ecosystem.  Unlike The DAO hard fork in 2016 (which took place after 3.6 million ETH was stolen in The DAO hack, prompting the creation of a separate blockchain called Ethereum Classic), Ethereum will continue as a single network after the Merge. In essence, the entire Ethereum PoW chain becomes the Ethereum PoS chain. The Merge will not affect the data layer of Ethereum so no transactions will be lost in this transition. However, because mining will no longer be required, miners will likely stake their assets and help validate the Ethereum mainnet.  Timeline of Ethereum updates and forks:  Although it can be a drawn-out process given the number of moving parts and the market impact of Ethereum, these software upgrades require rigorous testing from the community and core developers to mitigate any bugs or vulnerabilities. Several notable tests, upgrades and forks since the launch of the Beacon Chain as part of the transition to proof-of-stake include:  'London' hard fork (Aug. 5, 2021):  Following the Beacon Chain genesis, the ""London"" hard fork was largely instrumental in dictating the way miners interact and profit with Ethereum through various improvements such as EIP-1559. Along with a reduction in fees, another drastic change in the financial incentives for miners is the “difficulty bomb” that will force the proof-of-work consensus to stop producing blocks and therefore make it unprofitable to mine. The EIP-3554 included in the London hard fork delayed the time bomb to December 2021. However, this was later extended by several months by the Arrow Glacier network upgrade (see below).  An overview of the EIP proposals related to the London hard fork can be found on the Ethereum Cat Herders Medium account.  Altair upgrade (Oct. 27, 2021):  As the first scheduled upgrade for the Beacon Chain, the Altair upgrade imposed no changes to Ethereum front-end users but required node operators to upgrade their clients. Nodes that didn’t undergo any upgrades would risk not being able to participate in the network post-Merge and might pay penalty fees.  Arrow Glacier (Dec. 9, 2021):  The Arrow Glacier network upgrade pushed the date of the “difficulty bomb” back several months. It was the only change in the upgrade.  Ethereum merged on Kiln testnet (March 16, 2022):  Ethereum reached a significant milestone in mid-March with the Klin testnet merge. This involved a proof-of-work execution layer merging with a proof-of-stake Beacon Chain. While the merging was largely successful, developer Tim Beiko found that one client was not producing blocks as expected.  Ropsten testnet merged (June 8, 2022):  The Ropsten testnet was the first of three public testnets to successfully merge its proof-of-work (PoW) execution layer with the Beacon Chain proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus chain. According to Ethereum developers, there was a 99% participation rate after configuration fixes and reboots. Despite a few minor issues, the Ropsten merge was generally considered a major success, and marked the beginning of similar trial runs that would take place on other Ethereum testnets ahead of the PoS Merge.  Gray Glacier upgrade (June 30, 2022):  The Gray Glacier upgrade occurred at block 15,050,000 and introduced changes to the parameters of the network’s difficulty bomb, pushing it back by 700,000 blocks, to sometime in September. No other changes were introduced as part of Gray Glacier.  Sepolia testnet merged (July 6, 2022):  The second of three public testnets, Sepolia, went live when TTD hit 17,000,000,000,000,000. The merge happened over a two-step process: First the operators needed to update their consensus layer and execution layer clients together. That then activated two further phases: the first at an epoch height on the Beacon Chain and the second upon hitting the total difficulty value on the execution layer. No significant problems were encountered and the merge was considered successful.  Goerli testnet merged (Aug. 10, 2022)  The third and final public testnet completed a ""practice run"" of the Merge and successfully moved to proof-of-stake when the Terminal Total Difficulty (TTD) exceeded 10,790,000. This followed the Bellatrix upgrade to Goerli’s beacon chain, Prater, which was activated on Aug. 4.  Mainnet shadow forks 1-10 (starting April 12, 2022):  In essence, a shadow fork is a test run of the Merge. Without actually impacting the network, they simulate what the shift from PoW to PoS would look like by testing it on a small number of network nodes. After running shadow forks on several of its testnets, Ethereum developers began testing on Ethereum's mainnet. Mainnet shadow forks, which simulate the Merge on Ethereum's high-traffic primary network, test how the Merge would work under the most realistic possible conditions.  As an example, according to Ethereum Foundation developer Parithosh Jayanthi, while the Kiln merge testnet was designed ""to allow the community to practice running their nodes, deploying contracts, testing infrastructure, etc"" the mainnet shadow fork goes a step further to stress-test the network. Credited to Van Der Wijden, it was noted as a historical event and key in determining the timing of the final merging.  Once the shadow fork went live, the developer team noticed some issues with Ethereum-based software systems provider Nethermind and Hyperledger Besu, a Java-based open-source Ethereum client.  Overall, ten successful mainnet shadow forks from April through July 2022 (with more planned) have made Ethereum developers optimistic the real Merge might finally be around the corner.  More detail on the history of Ethereum and its various milestones leading up to the Merge can be found here.  What happens after the Merge?  In essence, the goal of the Merge is to expedite the process of moving from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. To accelerate the transition, developers are working on reducing the features that may cause delay and temporarily inhibit the ability to withdraw staked ETH once the Merge is finalized. However, these will likely be addressed in a post-Merge ""cleanup"" upgrade.  Read more: Ethereum After the Merge: What Comes Next?  Once the Merge is complete and Ethereum's newly adopted consensus layer takes on the role of adding new blocks to the Ethereum blockchain using the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, developers will work on a few new phases they call the Surge, the Verge, the Purge and the Splurge. These will continue to make Ethereum's proof-of-stake blockchain more scalable and secure.  For example, while the Merge will not immediately solve challenges with scalability, it will help prepare the network for Ethereum’s version of subsidiary shard chains that will rely on a fully functional PoS network to operate. Through spreading the data load of the network across 64 blockchains, shard chains provide additional cheaper layers for applications and rollups to store data. They also enable layer 2 systems to offer low transaction fees while benefiting from the security of the Ethereum mainnet.

42411421,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNeUo,1660222200,Crypto’s Downturn Makes Space for Education and Regulation,"I’ve been told several times over the past few weeks that cryptocurrencies and digital assets are maturing asset classes and that blockchain is a maturing technology.  These comments, at times, seem like jumps to conclusions. They fail to draw upon facts to back up their bold claims about the future. But they do raise an important question – how exactly does an asset class mature?  We haven’t seen a new asset class for many decades, even my entire lifetime. Yes, we’ve seen the advent of the exchange-traded fund (ETF) since I’ve come of age, but the ETF is more of a product wrapper than an asset class itself. We’ve also seen the growth of indexing and smart beta investing, but these are merely new takes on the same old asset classes investors were using throughout most of the last century.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  Is crypto really maturing?  The first cryptocurrency, bitcoin, came about around 14 years ago, making it an adolescent in human years. And if we look at cryptocurrency markets, they’ve been acting like sullen teenagers over the past 10 months – volatile, moody and unpredictable.  All the trials and errors of crypto cause me to reflect on a couple more questions:  First, is crypto just undergoing a brief phase or is it doomed to some extremely long and frustrating period of immaturity before it emerges into a more stable epoch of adulthood? Second, how will we know when crypto has grown up?  The answer to the first question, according to a couple industry insiders, is somewhere in between. And the answer to the second question depends on the regulatory landscape.  Volatility provides opportunity for education  These cycles of growth and downside volatility are just part of the maturation process.  “You have to go through market cycles, especially when you have a new phenomenon,” said Jahon Jamali, chief marketing officer and co-founder of Sarson Funds, a crypto asset manager and education service for financial advisors. “Growth occurs, but then the news shifts from good to bad and you have these drawdowns. And this is the time where people, who were interested but didn’t want to get caught up in the hysteria, start to learn about the new asset class.”  The best part, according to Jamali, is that it will result in “a lot of garbage being cleaned out of the market.”  We can therefore see periods of drawdown, like right now, as opportunities instead of setbacks. The downturn has served as an entry point for many investors and gives clients – and financial advisors – a much-needed chance to bolster their education on crypto before the next market cycle heats up.  Read more: Want to boost your crypto knowledge? Check out CoinDesk's Learn platform here.  Sarson Funds, for example, has seen an uptick in users accessing its educational materials on crypto.  “Now is a great time to come get this education,” Jamali said. “What a lot of people don’t always grasp is that digital assets won’t just be bitcoin and [ether] and so on and so forth. We’re going to see other asset classes tokenized and other types of traditional markets and publicly traded firms incorporated on the blockchain in different ways.”  Regulation may support mainstream adoption  The move from cryptocurrencies into more mainstream asset classes may begin to happen with the help of regulation.  “There’s a growing recognition among advisors and others across the globe that [the crypto space] needs to become much more closely regulated,” said Ben Richmond, CEO and founder of CUBE.  Given that CUBE is an AI-infused regulatory information service for the financial services industry, Richmond has had his finger on the pulse of crypto regulation activity.  Richmond mentioned that, on the other side of the chasm, technology firms that have been driving crypto will converge with the traditional financial world – and consequently the regulatory framework and regulated community at large.  At the same time, the traditional financial community together with regulators need to be careful not to overstep their bounds.  “Hopefully this convergence doesn’t stymie all the innovation, but can put forward the imperative of governance and control in the same way that any other financial entity is regulated,” Richmond said.  So far, that has not been the case. There is a gap present between digital assets and regulators because digital assets have evolved and proliferated much faster than regulations can respond.  Watch: US Crypto Regulation Bill Needs More Work to Define Boundaries  “Over the next two or three years there’s got to be a catch-up and alignment where regulators can address what is absolutely going to become mainstream financial infrastructure in pretty much every sense of the phrase,” Richmond said. “It will have to become very heavily regulated in a way that other traditional financial markets are regulated.”  As a result, another gap will emerge between new and incumbent crypto firms. Incumbent crypto firms, many of whom came up on the technology side of the business, will have to adjust to new regulations. This could create a reorganization of the players in the crypto landscape.  “Regulators will catch up over the next couple of years and get ahead of where the new firms are. Firms won't be ready in terms of the infrastructure and the capability to adapt to the regulations in the way that more mature, established, material firms are able to.”  The result? The crypto space, which has been dominated by upstart and standalone crypto projects, could come to be ruled over by the same giant incumbents that dominate traditional finance, according to Richmond.  But advisors can’t afford to wait for the Fidelitys and Schwabs of the world to become the biggest players in crypto.  “By the nature of the guidelines they operate under and the responses they have to be prepared to give to investors, financial advisors are required to maintain a certain level of knowledge of all investments,” Jamali said. “Advisors still need to understand this asset class because it is becoming a notable, if not major, component of overall financial markets – and as we said, it’s not going away.”  Jamali added that he expects an initial, broad slate of crypto regulations to be drafted by U.S. agencies this fall.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/08/11/cryptos-downturn-makes-space-for-education-and-regulation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cdd982356a3921160d857395d70a13a8903308db-3855x2891.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374078,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXGVx,1660220619,Bitcoin Rallies to 2-Month High; What's Next?,"Bitcoin (BTC) is rallying after Wednesday's U.S. economic data offered hope that rampant inflation might have peaked and that the Federal Reserve will slow liquidity tightening in the months ahead. According to some analysts, however, those hopes may be misplaced and those dreaming of a steady bull run may be disappointed.  The U.S. consumer price index surged 8.5% in July from a year ago, matching June's pace but falling below the average estimate of 8.7%, according to the economists surveyed by FactSet. Core inflation, which strips out food and energy prices, rose 5.9%, compared with expectations of a 6.1% increase.  Bitcoin has rallied 6.5% to $24,500 since the release of the CPI data. The cryptocurrency clocked a high of $24,744 during the early hours of Thursday, its highest price since June 13.  The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies, hit a five-week low of 104.64 on Wednesday and was at 105 at the time of this writing. Futures tied to the S&P 500 traded 0.33% higher, hinting at a continuation of Wednesday's rally.  Bull trap?  Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute, cautioned investors from chasing the rally as the core inflation provides the Fed little wiggle room.  ""Looking through the past two CPI reports, core CPI is still running at an annualized 6% pace. We are still awaiting the Fed to acknowledge the trade-off: that crushing growth would be needed to get inflation back to 2%,"" Boivin said in a tweet thread published after the CPI release.  ""We expect the Fed to pivot eventually, but the stickiness of core inflation tells us that the market has become overly optimistic on how soon the Fed might do so. That’s why we don’t think this bear market rally is one to chase and expect more volatility ahead,"" he added.  Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader at crypto asset management firm Blofin, said that ""liquidity pressures are expected to ease in the far future, but certainly not now. And so, with liquidity pressures still mounting, the crypto market rally looks like a bull trap.""  The Fed attempted to deliver that message to markets on Wednesday, with Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari saying the central bank is ""far, far away from declaring victory"" on inflation. Kashkari said that he hadn't seen anything that could change the Fed's current strategy of raising rates to 3.9% by year end and 4.4% by the end of 2023. The benchmark rate is in the 2.25%-2.5% range, which means the Fed is only halfway through the rate cycle.  Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at Genesis Global Trading, shared a similar opinion, saying the core CPI appears stick and the so-called Fed pivot may be months away. ""The data yesterday does not mean the Fed will ease up on rate hikes, not until they see a trend of core CPI moderation, which is probably months away,"" Acheson said.  Genesis Global is owned by Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.  Don't forget quantitative tightening  The Fed's balance sheet shrinkage, or quantitative tightening (QT), often referred to as the underappreciated but potent sister of rate hikes, seems to have fallen out of focus with market discussions centered around rate hikes.  The central bank is scheduled to accelerate QT to its maximum speed of $95 billion per month starting in September.  ""Quantitative tightening is the elephant in the room and is set to accelerate three times from July’s rate to $90 billion per month in September,"" Lewis Harland, a researcher at Decentral Park Capital, told CoinDesk. ""This is important as the rate of change in Fed balance sheet is correlated to the rate of change in crypto-asset prices.""  Harland added that the QT might act as a fundamental macro headwind for risky assets later this year.  Crypto factors may offer support  The recent recovery in crypto markets is at least, in part, fueled by the optimism about the Ethereum blockchain's long-awaited Merge. The supposedly bullish upgrade will likely happen next month and could shelter the crypto market from bearish macro factors.  ""The stock market reaction [to CPI] felt more emotional than rational, but the crypto market reaction – while partly a relief bump – is also being driven by the predominance of crypto-specific narratives, such as the Merge as well as notable progress on some DeFi (decentralized finance) platforms,"" Acheson said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/08/11/bitcoin-rallies-to-2-month-high-what-next,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/34368d08cd461cafd869f4d96c51311612fd6e91-1704x1278.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374076,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXGTR,1660217248,JPMorgan: Ethereum Miners Face an Abrupt Change Following the Merge,"Ethereum miners are facing an abrupt change after the network moves to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism from a proof-of-work (PoW) system and their role effectively ends, forcing them to seek alternative income streams, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report Wednesday.  This switch, also known as the Merge, is the first of five planned upgrades for the blockchain, and is provisionally expected to take place in September.  Ethereum mining is dominated by GPU (graphics processing units) rigs, which are more flexible than those used for bitcoin mining and can be more easily reconfigured to mine for other coins. GPU rigs can be used for mining compatible cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum Classic, Ravencoin and Ergo as well as for gaming, it said.  Ether (ETH) mining is popular because of its profitability, the bank said, and a shift to mining other cryptocurrencies could mean a hit to profits in the near term. In addition, the sudden influx of large mining pools to a different coin could squeeze margins for the incumbents, the report added. Those ether miners using ASIC (application-specific integrated circuits) equipment have few alternatives beyond Ethereum Classic.  Read more: What the Merge Means for Ethereum Miners  Ethereum Classic (ETC) miners could be among the main beneficiaries of the switch, JPMorgan said. That’s because there’s likely to be a surge of secondhand mining rigs available from ETH miners that have decided to become validators on Ethereum 2.0.  There are signs this shift to Ethereum Classic is already taking place, with a noticeable increase in the hashrate since mid-July, the bank said. Some investors also view Ethereum Classic as a “hedge against any potential disruptions in the Ethereum blockchain during the shift from PoW to PoS,” according to JPMorgan.  The most likely outcome after Ethereum moves to PoS may be that miners distribute their rigs across different networks that support GPU mining, as well as other applications to get “salvage value,” the note said, adding that as the transition approaches, mining pools will likely transition relatively smoothly.

The money laundering investigation gained attention recently after the ED raided the properties of a WazirX director. This sparked an online spat between WazirX founder Nischal Shetty and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao over whether Binance owns of the Indian exchange.  The government agency estimates the accused firms laundered more than 1,000 crore rupees, or around US$130 million, in the instant loan app case, adding that most of the allegations have a China link, the report said.  In an earlier press release, the ED had stated ""summons were issued to the crypto exchanges"" after conducting raids on the properties of a WazirX director. The ET report adds that at least 10 exchanges are under investigation.

The Treasury Department's action led to a significant increase in accounts flagged by dYdX's compliance provider, which is used to highlight accounts potentially associated with ransomware, malware, child sex abuse material, known criminals and sanctions lists, the company said in a blog post.  The dYdX accounts were subsequently blocked even though the owners may never have directly engaged with Tornado Cash. Users do not necessarily know the origin of the funds transferred to them, the exchange said.  ""Many accounts were blocked because a certain position of the wallet's funds (in many cases, even immaterial amounts) were associated at some time with Tornado Cash,"" dYdX said.  According the Treasury Department, Tornado Cash was used by the Lazarus Group, a North Korean hacking group it tied to the $625 million hack of Axie Infinity's Ronin Network in March. Tens of millions of dollars have flowed through the mixer, which was designed to obscure the origin of funds.  DYdX asked users who think their accounts have been wrongly blocked to contact its compliance team.  CoinDesk has requested further comment from dYdX.

42394971,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWeg9,1660207527,'Copycats' Stole $88M During Nomad Exploit by Copying Attacker's Code: Coinbase,"Some 88% of the exploiters behind Nomad’s bridge attack were likely those who merely copied the key attacker’s code and executed their own attack, new research from crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) estimated this week.  Nomad, a cross-chain bridge that allowed users to send and receive tokens between different blockchains, was exploited in early August for over $190 million, or about the entirety of its token reserves.  The Coinbase research shows some 88% of all addresses that conducted the exploit were identified as “copycats” that together stole about $88 million in tokens from the bridge.  “The majority of copycats used a variation of the original exploit by simply modifying targeted tokens, amounts and recipient addresses,” Coinbase researchers said.  “While the majority of valuable tokens were claimed by just two of the original exploiters’ addresses, hundreds of others were able to claim part of the bridge’s holdings,” the researchers added.  Nomad did not return requests for comment at press time.  On Twitter, Paradigm researcher @samczsun explained that a recent update of one of Nomad’s smart contracts made it easy for users to spoof transactions, as previously reported.  This meant users were able to withdraw money from the Nomad bridge that didn’t actually belong to them. And unlike some bridge attacks, where a single culprit is behind the entire exploit, the Nomad attack was a free-for-all.  “... [Y]ou didn't need to know about Solidity or Merkle Trees or anything like that. All you had to do was find a transaction that worked, find/replace the other person's address with yours, and then re-broadcast it,” @samczsun said in a tweet in early August.  Such a scenario allowed early observers of the exploit to merely copy the attacker’s code, add their addresses and broadcast the changed code to the network in order to steal funds from Nomad.  This also caused the original exploiters “to compete against hundreds of copycats” for their attack, the Coinbase researchers pointed out.  Meanwhile, Nomad is currently working with security agencies and ethical hackers to recover part of the stolen funds and launched a bounty program last week. Over $25 million in funds have been returned as of Aug. 10, but most of it remains missing.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | RESEARCH,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/08/11/copycats-stole-88m-during-nomad-exploit-by-copying-attackers-code-coinbase,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/68d2ce022a493abd72be73192f749a4c635df36d-5333x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394950,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWeQP,1660205859,Crypto Fund QCP Capital Says Options Trading Is Next Institutional Growth Driver,"SEOUL, South Korea — Options trading is likely to be a key bet among institutional investors in cryptocurrencies than other niches such as decentralized finance (DeFi) or non-fungible token finance (NFTfi) in the coming years, according to prominent crypto fund QCP Capital.  “DeFi has been big, GameFi has been big and options have always taken a backseat,” Darius Sit, QCP Capital co-founder, said at a Korean Blockchain Week panel here attended by CoinDesk. “But this year, and going forward, is going to be more interesting because the space is getting more institutional.”  Options are popular among professional traders because they give the buyer the right – but not the obligation – to buy or sell the underlying asset at a specific price on or before a certain date. These products can be used to lay speculative bets and hedge risk.  Sit argued that institutions were likely to adopt a financial instrument, such as an option, that was much more conversant compared with niche on-chain tools or non-fungible token (NFT)-based financial platforms.  “The first stop for them is usually [options] because for them it's is the same product, same instrument, same market structure, just different underlying. And so options and futures become a very big first of all for them,” Sit said.  The ex-BNP Paribas trader said “big name” banks are coming in and starting to “dominate"" options flow: “These guys used to do billions or trillions in forex. Now they're doing it in crypto,” he said.  As for the preferred venue to trade such products, Sit said institutions were likely to use centralized exchanges over their decentralized counterparts for the former’s ease of onboarding, settlements and overall distribution channels.

42394965,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWeZG,1660201145,Ether Tops $1.9K as Ethereum Runs Final 'Merge' Rehearsal,"Ether (ETH) rose to a two-month high early Thursday, outperforming bitcoin (BTC), after the Ethereum network ran the final dress rehearsal of its upgrade.  The native token of the Ethereum blockchain rose to $1,919, the highest point since June 1, extending Monday's rise of nearly 9%, CoinDesk data shows. The ether-bitcoin exchange rate or the ETH/BTC ratio rose to 0.078, a level last seen on Jan. 7, extending the recent bullish breakout.  The move happened after Goerli – one of the largest and most active Ethereum test networks – switched to the proof-of-stake consensus from the proof-of-work consensus at 01:45 UTC.  Goerli's successful transition follows similar moves by two testnets – Ropsten and Sepolia – in the months prior. The transition has brought the Ethereum mainnet one step closer to the supposedly-bullish upgrade dubbed ""Merge"", which Ethereum developers estimate will happen on Sept. 19.  Analysts expect the Merge, which will combine Ethereum's current proof-of-work chain with the proof-of-stake Beacon Chain, to cause a notable reduction in ether's supply, bringing a bitcoin-like store of value appeal to ether.  Last month, developers hinted at Sept. 19 as the tentative date for the merge. Since then, ether has rallied 60% while bitcoin has gained 20%. The broader market capitalization has increased by 28% to $1.2 trillion.  Perhaps the Merge has filled the bullish narrative void, relieving the market battered by the U.S. Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes.  Traders have been piling into call options, or bullish bets, tied to ether. Some have been buying the cryptocurrency in the spot market and simultaneously selling futures contracts, creating so-called backwardation – a situation where futures trade at a discount to the spot price. The strategy would help traders safely pocket free coins from a potential post-merge chain split without having to worry about losses from ether price volatility.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/08/11/ether-tops-19k-as-ethereum-runs-final-merge-rehearsal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d31a838f2d1263ec745bfea725a55565b4b39794-2824x1370.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

After this, the mainnet Merge is expected to occur sometime at the end of September.  The network transitioned to proof-of-stake (PoS) when the Terminal Total Difficulty (TTD) exceeded 10,790,000. That occurred around 1:45 UTC.  On July 27, Ethereum announced the Bellatrix upgrade to Goerli’s beacon chain, Prater, in preparation for the testnet merge. After the Bellatrix beacon chain was activated on August 4, all that was left was for it to merge with Goerli, so it the testnet could continue to run on the PoS chain.  The testnet merge takes the project one step closer to Ethereum's mainnet upgrade later this year. The two previous testnet merges, Ropsten and Sepolia, were largely successful as well, heightening Ethereum community confidence that the actual Merge should be able to happen this year.

42394947,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWePQ,1660179956,California Man Must Pay $61K in Restitution for SIM Swap Scam That Stole One Victim's Crypto,"A California man must pay over $61,000 in restitution and received an additional sentence of three years of probation after pleading guilty for his part in a SIM swap scam that targeted at least 40 people and robbed one victim of more than $57,000 in crypto, the U.S. Department of Justice announced Wednesday.  Richard Yuan Li, whom prosecutors had charged with one count of conspiracy to commit felony wire fraud, and co-conspirators stole the crypto from an unnamed New Orleans physician after gaining access to multiple crypto accounts. The victim had accounts with Binance, Bittrex, Coinbase, Gemini and Poloniex, among others. At one point, one conspirator attempted to extort the victim for 100 bitcoin (BTC), said the Justice Department.  The 21-year-old Li was sentenced in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Prosecutors said that Li's actions amounted to federal crimes because the SIM swaps transmitted signals across state lines and were therefore subject to the interstate commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution. Li must also perform 100 hours of community service.  A SIM swap scam involves the fraudulent acquisition of a cellular phone and subsequent directing of a victim's incoming calls and texts to another phone. Scammers are then able to acquire personal financial information, including bank and cryptocurrency accounts, as well as other accounts with two-factor authentication.  In their multi-art scheme, which ran for most of 2018, Li and his co-conspirators tricked an Apple (AAPL) representative into sending them an iPhone 8, “arranged for victims’ telephone numbers to be swapped” to that phone, and then bypassed their target’s security measures to gain access to files.  From July 2018 to December 2018, LI participated in unauthorized SIM Swaps that targeted at least 40 telephone numbers, prosecutors said in a statement.  On Nov. 10, 2018, the physician's telephone number was swapped to the iPhone 8, which LI kept in his dorm room at a university in California.  A separate SIM Swap of another individual on Dec. 4, 2018, resulted in that victim losing approximately $4,000 of an undisclosed currency.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | BNB,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/11/california-man-must-pay-61k-in-restitution-for-sim-swap-scam-that-stole-one-victims-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4e6c7003f9c899b7392b04aedbbc2316e1ca1454-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
