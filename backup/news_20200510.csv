Hanfa’s board of directors backed Griffon Asset Management’s plan to establish and manage the Passive Digital Asset fund. In the same decision, Hanfa also approved Croatian state-owned bank HPB to serve as the depository.      As described in Hanfa ruling, the passive fund invests exclusively in bitcoin. The initial investment period closes once total assets hit 1,000,000 HRK or 15 working days after the ruling, whichever comes first.      Investors can make their initial investment in cash or bitcoin, the Hanfa decision read. Griffon did not respond to a request for comment.      Griffon will use three separate blockchain explorers to calculate daily asset value, the ruling said. Every day, the explorers must return matching values before the Griffon can record the total.      “Also, access to and disposal of crypto assets requires multiple key signatures that are physically stored in separate secure locations, and the transfer of assets cannot take place without the approval of both the Company and the Depository with their keys,” the ruling said.      The bitcoin fund carries a 2.5% management fee. Griffon takes 3.5% from investors that exit in less than a year and 2.5% from investors who jump before two. It drops the exit fee after that. There is no performance fee.      Hanfa approved Griffon's bid to manage assets in May 2019.

42383639,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xwSx,1589122800,"Meet Brian Klein, Crypto's Own 'High-Stakes' Trial Attorney","Call him the David Boies of crypto.      Brian Klein may not be a household name in the blockchain space, but several of his clients – Erik Voorhees, Charlie Shrem and Block.one, to name a few – certainly are. The self-described “high-stakes trial attorney” has exploded onto the scene in recent years as a successful defender in numerous civil and criminal cases in the technology and cryptocurrency worlds.      He’s now representing Virgil Griffith, the Ethereum developer and former Ethereum Foundation head of special projects accused by the U.S. government of traveling to North Korea to speak at a conference and discuss sanctions evasion using cryptocurrency.      In January, Griffith confidently entered an “innocent” plea before a district judge, kicking off the months-long, multi-step discovery and eventual trial process which Klein hopes will lead to an acquittal.      CoinDesk met with Klein in mid-December, partly in the hopes that he would chat about this case but largely to get a sense of the attorney whose name kept popping up on the radar.      Perhaps unsurprisingly, he declined to comment about Griffith’s case beyond previous statements declaring his belief that his client would be exonerated. Dressed in a plaid shirt and gray jacket, he shared his insights on litigating in the fintech space, working with entrepreneurs and crypto overall.      “It’s very enjoyable representing entrepreneurs and founders, they’re the people really building the industry,” Klein said of crypto, a space where he’s worked since 2013.      “I think a lot of people in this space feel a lot of camaraderie with each other even though it's a competitive space and that makes the industry a lot of fun to work for,” he said. “There’s no reason you can’t have lots of digital currencies, lots of tokens out there. I think it’s vindication.”    ‘Libertarian by nature’    Klein began his legal career at the New York University School of Law, has lived on both the East and West coasts of the U.S. and is now a partner at Baker Marquart LLP. In his past, he’s worked at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, Skadden Arps, Brafman & Associates and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California.      He had the option of continuing to work at large law firms but chose to join Baker Marquart, a small, Los Angeles-based law firm boasting fewer than 20 trial lawyers on its website, said Klein, who will speak Monday at Consensus: Distributed.      “I wanted to represent [both] individuals and companies and it’s really hard to do both at big law firms because of conflicts,” he explained.      He joined Baker Marquart in 2012 and entered the crypto space a year later after reading guidance from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and writing an article on the subject.      “I’m a libertarian by nature and I have a lot of issues with how big finance is [treated] globally, and in our country, and it leaves a lot of people outside looking in,” he said, referring to un- and underbanked individuals unable to access the modern financial system.      See also: USA v. Virgil Griffith: What We Know (and Don’t) in the Bombshell Crypto Sanctions Case      While Klein’s record is prominent, his peers were downright effusive. David Silver, a prominent litigator in the crypto space in his own right, told CoinDesk that Klein provides “the best representation possible by the best lawyer available.”      “I only hope I never need his counsel, but if I did I would hire him in a second,” he said.      Likewise, Compound Finance General Counsel Jake Chervinsky told CoinDesk that Klein is “one of the best defense attorneys in the crypto industry.”      Marcia Hoffman, who joined Klein in representing cybersecurity researcher Marcus Hutchins, told CoinDesk Klein’s first reaction to a new case is to determine “how do we get a handle on what’s happening.”      “He will just come right in and immediately is thinking about ‘how do we get this situation under control,’ ‘how do we put ourselves in the best position moving forward,’ which can be really stressful,” she said.    Friendly, but efficient    Over a breakfast of oatmeal, fruit and a bagel at a downtown Manhattan hotel – and later, during a hearing – Klein maintained a soft-spoken tone but projected confidence in his past work and future efforts.      Several of his former clients described him as a friendly, personable attorney. Two of them, noted bitcoin entrepreneur Shrem and Hutchins (otherwise known as MalwareTech, one of the researchers who halted the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017), both said Klein spoke to them as friends outside their legal cases.      “I still talk to him very frequently just about life in general,” Shrem told CoinDesk.      His personable manner was on display during Griffith’s arraignment. Prior to the hearing’s start, Klein appeared to be reassuring his client while sorting the case’s projected timeline.      “It’s okay,” Klein told Griffith after sidebarring with the assistant U.S. attorneys prosecuting the case. Then the two men sat down and began a protracted, whispered conversation.      As a lawyer, Klein “managed expectations very well,” Shrem said, referring to the expectations Klein set for his case and how he predicted certain options would play out.      As a client, Shrem said he never felt like he’d lost control of his case. Among other details, he praised Klein’s management style, saying Klein coordinated his team of attorneys to minimize the costs to Shrem during a case against Winklevoss Capital Management, the family office started by Gemini founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.      See also: Freedom Fighter or Fool? Jury’s Out on Arrested Ethereum Developer Virgil Griffith      Klein said he’s available 24/7 for his clients, and while “it’s sometimes disruptive to your personal life,” he’s found it’s helped him overall.      Hutchins said Klein had checked in during holidays and invited him to several events during his time in the U.S. (A U.K. resident, Hutchins was unable to leave the U.S. during his case.)      “My impression is that he's a great lawyer but also a kind person. He took my case pro-bono because I didn't have the money to afford legal counsel,” Hutchins said. “I've also seen him go out of his way to help out people in similar situations.”      Still, his friendliness doesn’t stop Klein from winning his high-profile cases. Hutchins was sentenced to supervised release and the judge in his case advocated for a full pardon; Shrem won $45,000 in legal fees after settling the Winklevoss’s case against him (the twins’ lawyer was fined $15,000 for “improper behavior” during the case); and Block.One agreed to pay $24 million in a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, with the agency granting a waiver essentially ensuring the EOS token is not deemed a security.      Klein told CoinDesk he’s bullish over the long term about cryptocurrencies, citing bitcoin’s status as a form of digital money not controlled by any government or single, centralized entity.      Still, he said, “I think there’s a lot of work to do here.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/10/meet-brian-klein-cryptos-own-high-stakes-trial-attorney,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6c9ba034b712534d19ff7d8fe8c45304bfdee633-907x605.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383651,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xwi3,1589115968,The CoinDesk 50: MakerDAO Is the Godzilla of DeFi,"MakerDAO is the Godzilla of DeFi, a decentralized beast born of Vitalik's nuclear bomb: Ethereum.      At $350+ million in crypto locked into MakerDAO's smart contracts, it dominates the chief use case of the second-biggest blockchain. Like the celluloid firebreather before it, other similar beasts followed. The most well known are companies like Compound, Synthetix and dy/dx, making them equivalent to moviedom's Mothras, Rodans and Gameras. Gojira and his ilk are known as kaiju, and DeFi is crypto's equivalent.      In both the films and on the blockchains, regular denizens cannot look away, as each illustrates a grand potential but leaving the occasional inadvertent destruction in their wake. Both kinds of kaiju are weird, big and disruptive, and each can have only one King of Monsters.    This post is part of the CoinDesk 50, an annual selection of the most innovative and consequential projects in the blockchain industry. See the full list here.    On Ethereum, it all started with MakerDAO, a protocol that turns anyone's ether (ETH), USDC or BAT holdings into loans of a dollar-pegged stablecoin minted for this purpose: dai. This is Maker's magical idea. The money lent did not exist before the loan was made. It manifests the credit theory of money explicitly. And people actually use it.      Maker was founded in 2015 by Rune Christensen of Denmark, where the MakerDAO Foundation is largely (but not entirely) based. Christensen was motivated to make a cryptocurrency without price volatility. He and his cohorts came up with dai, and unlike most stablecoins, which are backed by fiat deposited in a bank, dai is backed by trustlessly staked cryptocurrency. Each dai token is worth $1 because that's the value the smart contracts enforce, primarily by collateralization rules.      Not satisfied with letting adoption of dai play out as it will, however, the team has invested in building up networks in specific parts of the world. That's what convinced a Canadian startup to begin lending dai to its Latin American users, collateralized by bitcoin.      Mauricio Di Bartolomeo is a Ledn co-founder and a native of Venezuela. He always wanted his company to serve Latin America, and he first encountered MakerDAO on a trip through the region to spread the word about Ledn's bitcoin-collateralized lending project. He was surprised to find the Maker Foundation already there educating would-be crypto users about MakerDAO and dai.      ""What really came to light in that experience was how hard they were working in the region,"" he said. ""With the community came the liquidity around dai.""      Ledn started surveying potential users to see what sort of asset they would like to borrow against bitcoin. They got a very strong response for dai as an option, Di Bartolomeo said. Some users wanted to participate in DeFi. Some just didn't have bank accounts. In either case, dai was the cryptocurrency they knew, so that's what they wanted. Di Bartolomeo credited old fashioned community building to the local adoption.      Still another Latin American entrepreneur we spoke to had a compelling vision for making his product essentially free to crypto users with dai, but it didn't fly.      Matias Nisenson of Argentinian game company Elemental wanted to let users stake dai to play rather than pay. Elemental created the game CryptoWars that used to be a gigantic, multiplayer resource management game (it's pivoting now). The idea was going to be that players could put up some dai, Elemental would deposit it on Compound and keep the interest in exchange for letting its owners play, but players could still get their dai back any time.      The game had managed to mainly cultivate a user base out of ETH holders, people who could take advantage of the tournament prizes they offered each weekend. Still, Nisenson said, it was ""too much of an investment for a user to just play a game. Too heavy."" Even if it meant they got to play the game essentially for free.      It was a good deal, but players didn't think giving up ETH's upside was worth it.      Like Godzilla himself, who came to function as humanity's protector, strange giants always unsettle mere mortals. After all, both tend to crush some underfoot on occasion, despite good intentions.

42383654,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xwkZ,1589112699,The Security Trilemma and the Future of Bitcoin,"Raphael Auer is principal economist in the Innovation and Digital Economy unit at the, Bank for International Settlements (BIS). His research focuses on issues related to cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and central bank digital currency. The views expressed here are his and do not necessarily reflect those of the BIS.        The imminent halving of the “block subsidy” exposes a fundamental threat to Bitcoin. Whenever a new block is added to the blockchain, a quantum of new bitcoins is created and paid to the miner adding the block. As miners compete for this subsidy, they drive up the system’s difficulty, making it harder for so-called 51% attacks to succeed. But the subsidy is set to diminish over time, halving very soon to 6.25 bitcoins per block, so that the total supply of coins will eventually reach 21 million. And as the subsidy shrinks, Bitcoin could fall victim to 51% attacks, just as smaller cryptocurrencies already have.    Raphael Auer is a speaker at Consensus: Distributed, CoinDesk's free virtual conference running May 11-15. Register here.    Yet, a future in which Bitcoin is plagued by 51% attacks is just one of the possible outcomes. In this column, I introduce the notion of a “security trilemma” to illustrate how the Bitcoin ecosystem could evolve as the subsidy falls. This trilemma refers to trade-offs that influence how well Bitcoin can function without the block subsidy.      See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      Put simply, “you can’t have it all,” and, once the subsidy shrinks beyond a certain point, users will have to accept compromises along at least one of three dimensions. In the future, Bitcoin will either become more centralized (i.e. rely on institutions to function), or its liquidity could dry up, or its supply needs to grow beyond the originally envisioned 21 million coins.    The role of the block subsidy for payment security    The extent to which Bitcoin depends on the block subsidy to function cannot be overstated. Looking at this issue in a BIS working paper, I showed a cryptocurrency that relies on proof-of-work to ensure payment finality is subject to two economic limitations.      The first lies in the extreme costs of ensuring payment finality within a reasonable space of time. For a start, miners’ income needs to be very high to deter 51% attacks. According to my calculations, for payments to be made irreversible within six blocks (i.e. roughly one hour), a miners’ income must amount to 8.3% of the transaction volume – a multiple of the transaction fees currently levied in today’s conventional payment services.    Bitcoin will either become more centralized..., or its liquidity could dry up, or its supply needs to grow beyond the originally envisioned 21 million coins.    The second limitation is that Bitcoin transaction fees alone cannot generate an adequate level of income for miners. Today, users pay an average fee of less than $1 per transaction. Each block can include up to about 3,500 transactions, but total fee income still adds up to only a fraction of the value of the block subsidy. In fact, the subsidy typically makes up over 99% of the total income (see Graph 1 below, left-hand side).      The paltry level of fees adds up to a classical “free-rider problem”: for any given transaction, the proof-of-work, and hence the security level, is determined at the level of its block. In contrast, the fee is set by each user privately. While each user stands to benefit if the miner reaps a high income, users have no incentive to contribute to that income with the fees they each pay. Taken together, these observations suggest that the liquidity of Bitcoin is set to deteriorate substantially with every halving.      As miner income falls, so does the system’s difficulty, and users will have to wait longer and longer before they can safely assume that a payment has gone through. The number of required confirmations will have to increase. My research (Graph 1, right-hand panel) indicates that, towards the end of this decade, it could take several hours or even days for payments to become irreversible. Eventually – i.e. once the block subsidy is phased out completely – waiting times could lengthen to months.    The security trilemma: in search of a Plan B for Bitcoin    Bitcoin will start to function differently as the block subsidy falls. One option, simulated above, is that transactions will require more and more confirmations. But this is not the only possible outcome. The range of scenarios can be visualized by adapting Vitalik Buterin’s “Scalability Trilemma” to the specific outlook for Bitcoin.      Bitcoin faces a “security trilemma” and a range of possible outcomes (see Graph 2). This trilemma means that, of the three properties that today make Bitcoin desirable to its fans (scarcity, decentralisation, and a liquid blockchain trading market), compromises will have to be made in at least one dimension. Bitcoin could become less liquid, or its protocol could be changed so that supply will eventually exceed 21 million, or it could become more centralized.    Scenarios involving lower liquidity    Scenarios involving lower liquidity mean that on-chain bitcoin trading will either be much slower or subject to much higher fees than is the case today. The most straightforward scenario is that the system remains unchanged and fees continue to be low, but that more confirmations are needed, as discussed above.      However, there is also another scenario involving lower liquidity, which is to create higher fees. This could, for example, be achieved via deliberately creating congestion. When newly added blocks are already at the maximum size permitted by the protocol, the system congests and transactions go into a queue. Users who want to have their transactions processed immediately start setting higher fees. During the peak crypto-hype in late 2017, transaction fees spiked to more than $50 per transaction in this way (see Graph 1, left-hand side). In the future, such congestion could also be created artificially, by adjusting the maximum number of transactions that Bitcoin can process.    Scenarios involving less scarcity    A very controversial scenario involves a substantial departure from Nakamoto’s initial design: continued supply growth. For example, one of the options discussed by researchers Hasu, Prestwich and Curtis is to change the protocol so that the supply of bitcoin will continue to grow beyond 21 million – for example by 1% annually. This would address the problem of the declining block subsidy head-on. However, as Hasu and colleagues note, such proposals have been met with scepticism for a number of reasons. A primary one is that many now see digital scarcity as Bitcoin’s prime virtue. Thus, while it remains a theoretical option, expanding the supply beyond 21 million would seem an unlikely scenario.    Scenarios involving less decentralization    A third set of possible outcomes involves less decentralization and some institutionalization. This could take several forms, including mining cartels. Even today, mining is dominated by a small number of large players. This can be a big issue when it comes to censorship resistance, but the upshot is that these large players have strategic incentives to guard transactions and thus protect their investment in mining equipment.      In the future, it is possible that miners might form cartels that would coordinate with each other to respond against any 51% attacks. MIT researchers Moroz, Aronoff, Narula and Parkes have analyzed the potential for double-spend counterattacks in the case of a single miner. If several miners were to be involved, this would require some kind of institutionalization – i.e. an agreement to ensure that the cooperation between the miners would work smoothly.      But institutionalization could also take other forms. For example, it might involve “proof-of-stake,” i.e. replacing costly proof-of-work computations with an essentially resource-free betting game. Why should this involve institutionalization? With proof-of-work, miners will normally follow the longest chain when choosing between blockchains, should these ever conflict. With proof-of-stake, the absence of an actual cost opens the door to so-called long-run attacks.      This is a problem that Buterin termed “weak subjectivity.” It implies that successful proof-of-stake implementations might need to rest on some central contact point that guides newcomers to the “honest” blockchain. It remains to be seen how well such arrangements might work.      The last option for institutionalization involves custody and off-chain trading on regulated exchanges. For years, bitcoin has traded on specialized exchanges such as Coinbase or Kraken. More recently, some trading activity has developed on Bakkt, a subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange. In the future, an increased share of trading could migrate to such regulated market places.      Of course, any such development would come with regulatory issues similar to those in standard financial markets. Starting with Mt. Gox, billions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrencies have been lost or stolen in recent years, as unregulated exchanges turned out to be fraudulent or simply incompetent. The industry could benefit from better regulation. That imminent regulation is not always bad news for cryptocurrencies, according to BIS research, adds to this case.      And regulation can also be adapted to the technology of cryptocurrencies, as I have outlined in another BIS working paper. The idea of “embedded supervision” is that the financial supervisor ensures that funds deposited with an exchange are fully backed by on-chain bitcoin holdings. Data delivery is automated, with the financial supervisor directly reading the ownership balances in the Bitcoin blockchain. In this way investors are protected, and the administrative burden on the crypto-exchange is kept to a minimum.    The road ahead: If not money, then what?    As the block subsidy falls, the Bitcoin ecosystem will need to change – not to grow, but just to limit the fallout. The future is likely to entail a steady transition to regulated exchanges, with fewer anonymous trades on the blockchain, and miners playing a lesser role.      As this is a far cry from the proclaimed revolution, the core value proposition of Bitcoin may well need to be re-evaluated. In all likelihood, Bitcoin’s long-run outlook will depend on the applications that can be made to run on top of it, and how well such applications get traction and generate revenue. In this, Bitcoin’s core asset may well turn out to be less the original proof-of-work-based technology than its large community of fans and developers, as well as the penumbra of media attention it continues to attract.      Only a few years ago, bitcoin was hailed as the future of money. But its manifold limitations have eroded this claim. Nowadays, a common narrative is that it is the digital equivalent to gold. But people will continue to trade gold for millennia, while few would dare to make such a claim for Bitcoin. Instead, the danger is that the cryptocurrency turns out to be the digital equivalent of sand slipping slowly through your fingers.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Raphael Auer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/05/10/the-security-trilemma-and-the-future-of-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d98b8da5c7a41d080fced4ef176d5dc43877f897-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
