42382847,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tBWz,1571349332,Facebook’s Libra Just Got Its First Major Supporter in Congress,"Amid a sea of scorn, one U.S. Senator is praising Libra.  Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) wrote a letter to Libra Association member Anchorage, a South Dakota-based trust company, endorsing the Facebook-led project and citing it as an example of a technological advance he feels is needed to aid U.S. consumers.  Rounds also pushed back against a more ""ominous"" letter penned by Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), warning the CEOs of Mastercard, Visa and Stripe that they may come under increased regulatory scrutiny should they continue participating in Libra. (All three, alongside PayPal, eBay, Mercado Pago and Booking Holdings, later quit the project.)  ""Technologies like Libra … have the potential to help unbanked and underbanked consumers right here at home,"" Rounds wrote Wednesday, adding:  ""It would be unfortunate to shun a new solution that could connect more of the most vulnerable Americans to our financial services system.""  Facebook revealed Libra  to widespread criticism and regulatory pushback in June, announcing a plan to bring financial services to 1.7 billion unbanked individuals worldwide using a digital currency accessible by any smartphone. Policymakers and other regulators denounced the project as a potential tool to destabilize the global financial order.  At its unveiling, Facebook announced that its subsidiary, Calibra, and 27 other companies would form a governing council to oversee the project, with plans to swell its ranks to 100 companies when Libra is ready to go live. Earlier this week in Geneva, 21 of those companies officially signed the charter forming the Libra Association.  Building Libra  Rounds emphasized the potential for Libra to aid unbanked users in his letter, noting that the Federal Reserve ""is itself still years away"" from creating its own real-time payments platform. Cryptocurrencies can take on this role instead, he said.  ""Given the length of time it will take for the Fed to finish FedNow, the Libra Association should not wait to see if recent conversations about a Fed-run digital currency come to fruition,"" he said.  Moreover, backlash to Libra within the U.S. ""is particularly puzzling,"" given the age of the current legal framework around cryptocurrencies, he said, adding:  ""As it stands, we have no clear legal way to ascertain whether a cryptocurrency is a security. What legal foundation we do have for these types of questions is rooted in the Securities Act of 1933. That law was written more than half a century before computers and the internet were created, more than two decades before Hawai'i was admitted to the Union, a decade before the jet engine was developed, and in a period of time in which 90 percent of rural America lacked electricity.""  (Former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Gary Gensler has previously said that Libra, at least, looks like an exchange-traded fund, which would fall under existing securities law.)  While the Libra Association and its members should follow the law in developing the project, Rounds said the pushback is ""not healthy for innovation.""  ""The demands of a few of my colleagues should not be viewed as defining federal policy when it comes to innovation in digital currencies,"" he added.  Rounds praised the ""deliberate approach"" taken by the Libra Association to date, citing conversations with Congress and U.S. regulators as two examples.  ""While the Association is still in the process of standing up its governance framework and its operating rules, it would be a shame to lose the progress you have already made in creating Libra,"" he said, addressing Anchorage.  Libra aside, Rounds said Congress and U.S. regulators should act to make it easier for cryptocurrency companies to operate within the U.S., saying a number of companies have told him they find it easier to operate overseas.

42374494,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZzuH,1571341342,What Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Said in His Defense of 'Free Expression',"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended free expression in a speech at Georgetown University on Thursday.  ""[The internet] allows people to share things that wouldn't have been possible to share before,” he said. However, “we’re seeing people across the spectrum try to define more speech as dangerous because it may lead to political outcomes that they see as unacceptable.”  Freedom of expression and censorship-resistance may be sacrosanct for cryptocurrency advocates. But Zuckerberg did not link his free-speech concerns to his company’s Libra cryptocurrency project, nor did he stake out an entirely radical position.  He acknowledged that certain restrictions on speech have always been a part of the U.S. political climate, but he called for a scenario in which those restrictions were as few as possible – and the decisions weren't left in the hands of private companies:  “I believe in giving people a voice because, at the end of the day, I believe in people.”  Nevertheless, Zuckerberg acknowledged that, for now, his company has too much power in deciding acceptable norms. ""We make a lot of decisions that affect people's ability to speak,"" he admitted, adding:  ""Frankly, I don't think we should be making so many decisions about people's speech on our own either.""  Those curious about how the Facebook-initiated Libra might dovetail with his comments were disappointed Thursday. Zuckerberg did not address his company's vision for cryptocurrency. Zuckerberg also did not address the themes of encryption and privacy that he spoke about earlier this year at the company's annual F8 developer conference.  You can watch the full speech here:  Digital IDs  Notably, the man who coded the initial version of Facebook himself suggested that technological solutions can and do already protect against the worst abuses on the platform.  In particular, he said Facebook has found that robust identity verification systems can undermine much of the virality of dangerous speech and disinformation, saying:  “The solution here is to verify the identities of anyone who’s getting a wide amount of distribution and to get a lot better at identifying and taking down fake accounts. We now require you to provide a government ID and prove your location if you want to run political ads.""  Zuckerberg noted that by using machine learning and other strategies, Facebook is able to disable millions of fake accounts opened on the platform each year, in part by spotting “clusters” of these fake users.  “You can still say controversial things if you want, but you have to stand behind them with your real identity,” he said.  Zuckerberg touted the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment, which protects the freedom of speech, and which he said stands in stark contrast with the views of other nations, especially China's.

42382846,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tBVj,1571331612,Libra Shows Central Banks' Failure on Cross-Border Payments: Riksbank,"Facebook’s Libra has been a wake-up call for central bankers. Now one such official – Gabriel Soderberg of Sweden’s Riksbank – says cross-border payments are where policymakers need to play catch-up.  “Libra showed there is a demand for something that central banks have not yet delivered, which is cheap, efficient cross-border payments,” Soderberg told CoinDesk, adding:  “Highlighting this gap means central banks really have to think about, ‘OK, how do we proceed?’ Here there is a problem that we haven't solved and how do you solve that with maximum security and resiliency.”  Soderberg, a Riksbank senior economist who works on Sweden’s e-krona project, gave a nod to another blockchain project focused on cross-border payments, referring to Libra as a “big Ripple” (albeit with a different underlying design).  “Some of what they plan to offer is similar,” Soderberg said.  Seizing the moment  Given Libra’s recent tumult, it’s perhaps not surprising that central banks that have been optimistic about digital fiat currency are speaking out in favor of innovation.  The 21-member Libra Association officially ratified its charter this week in Geneva, following the high-profile departures last week of Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Booking Holdings, eBay, Stripe and Mercado Pago, some of whom cited concerns over the regulatory backlash faced by the project.  Sweden has been working on its e-krona initiative for some years and is known to be ahead of the pack.  “I don't think it showed us something new – at least not here in Sweden,” Soderberg said of Libra. “For us, it was more like giving emphasis to what we already knew, so we need to keep on swimming with the current to keep up with what's happening as central banks. What is has shown us is just how fast things are happening.”  That said, the ideas underpinning cryptocurrencies like Libra and Ripple aren’t necessarily new, Soderberg said. The dream of an international currency has been alive and well since John Maynard Keynes spoke about the so-called Bancor the 1940s. “So it's an old sort of discussion,” he added.  Regarding Libra’s design of creating a stablecoin backed by a collection of major currencies and low-risk assets such as state bonds, Soderberg pointed out that Libra “inherits the monetary policy of a few wisely chosen central banks.” He went on to say:  “So, what is the stability of the stablecoin here – well, it's the state. Even they are going to the state to get stability for their private enterprise, and I think that's interesting.”  Keeping up  In recent weeks the Riksbank has signaled its interest in adapting to change rather than fighting it.  The Riksbank echoed comments from Bank of England governor Mark Carney on Tuesday, who again defended Libra, pointing out that moving money across borders is slow and can cost firms as much as 200 basis points per transaction.  Earlier this week  , Riksbank governor Stefan Ingves called Libra an “incredibly important catalytic event” forcing central bankers to reconsider the way they do business, but added that most private-sector money initiatives collapse sooner or later.  In an interview with CoinDesk, the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) – an umbrella financial institution owned by central banks – said monetary policymakers should be cautious about central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and variations on the theme, such as privately issued stablecoins. Such developments may require central banks to hold additional assets on their balance sheets.  Raphael Auer, of the innovation and digital economy unit at the BIS, said:  “Privately issued stablecoins … would raise questions regarding market power and how to guarantee that the coin is always fully backed. History shows that money is best left in the hands of an institution that is accountable to the public.”  Krona image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/10/17/libra-shows-central-banks-failure-on-cross-border-payments-riksbank,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f2dff860e316b1f0d06b41e438f46d582954acf7-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382842,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tBRx,1571327718,Telegram Responds to SEC: Gram Tokens Are Not Securities,"Telegram is pushing back against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The messaging platform filed a response to the securities regulator Wednesday, writing that the SEC's emergency injunction last week was unwarranted. Telegram is asking a federal court to deny the regulator's motion to enforce a subpoena.  Further, Telegram argued its upcoming gram token is not a security, and the SEC should not be able to force the company to produce documents or witnesses about its blockchain project.  The SEC filed an emergency action to prevent Telegram from distributing its gram tokens on Oct. 11, alleging that Telegram violated federal law by selling an unregistered security. In Wednesday's filing, Telegram claims that gram tokens are not securities, and the SEC's emergency action ""runs counter to longstanding Supreme Court precedent, the SEC's own views relating to other cryptocurrencies, and common sense.""  The filing explained that Telegram ""did not ... offer any securities to the public"" through an ICO, referencing the $1.7 billion it raised using a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) framework.  ""Telegram entered into private purchase agreements with a limited number of highly sophisticated purchasers (the 'Private Placement') that provided for the future payment of a currency (grams) but only following the completion and launch of the TON Blockchain,"" the filing said, adding:  ""Significantly, Telegram has already treated the Private Placement as a securities offering pursuant to valid exemptions to registration under the Securities Act of 1933. The grams themselves, as distinct from the purchase contracts, will merely be a currency or commodity (like gold, silver or sugar) — not a 'security' — once the TON Blockchain launches. ""  As a result of the SEC's action, however, Telegram is ready to hold off on launching the TON blockchain network and distributing tokens until all ""regulatory issues are resolved,"" the filing said.  Telegram emailed its investors  after the SEC's action, noting that while the company intended to launch TON at the end of October, ""the recent SEC lawsuit has made that timing unachievable."" The email asked investors to grant the company an extension of time to get the network running, noting a clause in the investor contracts offering a refund if TON was not live by its Oct. 30 deadline.  In the filing, Telegram asked the court to deny the SEC's injunction request, including the SEC's demand for Telegram to produce documents and witnesses; as well as have the court call on the SEC and Telegram to submit ""an expedited case schedule to resolve the legal issues underpinning the SEC's claims.""  ""There is no need for the Court to enter a preliminary injunction, which has the potential to be misconstrued by Telegram’s private placement subscribers and the public in this highly-publicized matter, where Telegram has already voluntarily agreed not to engage in the very conduct that the SEC is seeking to enjoin,"" the filing said.

Writing in a Financial Times op-ed on Thursday, Bruno Le Maire said the Facebook-led project is usurping the sovereign right of states to issue their own currencies, which will have dramatic and unforeseen repercussions.  The Libra Association signed its formal charter earlier this week in Geneva along with 20 other members.  When the euro was created in 1999, member nations surrendered aspects of their sovereignty to a greater European project. To allow Facebook and other Libra Association members to issue private money would undermine this effort, he said.  “Do we really want to give private interests such power, given the consequences it would have on trade and financial stability?” Le Maire asked. “I cannot countenance one of a sovereign state's most powerful tools, monetary policy, falling under the remit of entities not subject to democratic control.”  Le Maire reiterated the sentiments on Twitter, saying: ""Neither political nor sovereignty can be shared with private interests.""  The non-democratic nature of Libra’s privately issued currency – which Le Maire argued is a threat to national currencies in both underdeveloped and developed countries – was also cited as an issue:  “The monetary sovereignty of states is underpinned by their citizens' freedom of choice.”  To counter the threat from Libra, Le Maire called for the development of ""innovative national and cross-border payment methods,"" as well as the development of central bank digital currencies ""in the medium to long term.""  ""We cannot let China be the only player in this field,"" he added.  Le Maire has previously said France would seek to block Libra in the EU, as did Germany's finance minister, Olaf Scholz. Also noting the need for improved payment rails, Scholz called for an e-euro to strengthen the EU bloc amidst economic globalization.

42403382,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfr6C,1571317216,Blockchain-Shy Bank of America Quietly Pilots Ripple Technology,"Bank of America, the second-largest bank in the U.S., has quietly tested out Ripple’s distributed ledger technology – and may be planning to do more with it.  Ripple went so far as to identify B of A as a “customer” in a presentation given at a seminar held by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) late last year.  When asked about this, a Ripple spokesperson would neither confirm nor deny whether B of A was a customer – but said the companies had conducted a pilot together.  “Bank of America has been part of Ripple's Global Payment Steering Group since 2016 and we did a pilot with them,” she told CoinDesk.  The spokesperson would not provide any further details about the pilot, which was not previously reported. Bank of America declined to comment.  It was previously known that B of A is a member of the steering group that advises on rules and standards for Ripplenet, the network of financial institutions using Ripple products. But the news of the pilot is the strongest indication yet that the bank’s relationship with the startup goes beyond friendly advice.  That would be a departure for the bank, whose chief technology officer, Cathy Bessant, has said she’s bearish on the technology and that B of A's portfolio of blockchain patents (the most of any financial institution) exists only so it can pivot to blockchain quickly if the need arises.  One more sign B of A is warming to the sector is a job opening the bank posted earlier this month, for a product manager who would lead the team for a “Ripple project.”  The project was described as “a decentralized ledger technology-based solution to cross border payments marketed to GTS clients.” (GTS stands for global transaction services, a division of B of A that works with the treasury departments of large companies and financial institutions.)  Top of the roster  Saga Sarbhai, Ripple’s head of government and regulatory affairs for the Asia-Pacific region, made the presentation in December 2018, at a seminar convened by the IMF in Samoa on fintech and financial inclusion in the Pacific Islands.  The section of the presentation devoted to Ripple’s xCurrent service includes a slide entitled “A Snapshot of Our Customers.” The logo for Bank of America Merrill Lynch (B of A’s investment bank) appears at the top, followed by those of 15 other financial institutions from around the globe. They are not in alphabetical order.  The presentation was later published on IMF.org and recently circulated on Twitter. The IMF confirmed to CoinDesk that the document was genuine and that a Ripple executive gave the talk.  xCurrent, the service that B of A appears to have at least tested out, does not involve XRP, the cryptocurrency that Ripple periodically sells to fund operations and that powers its separate xRapid product.  Customers for the xCurrent payment system include American Express, Santander and PNC.  In August, Spanish banking giant Santander revealed to CoinDesk that xCurrent would enable the first online international transfers to the U.S. for some of its Latin American customers.

42403376,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfr3F,1571313609,Shellfish Plant Is Putting Scallops on IBM's Food Tracking Blockchain,"A seafood plant is working with IBM to track the provenance of fresh scallops using blockchain technology.  The Raw Seafoods plant in Fall River, Massachusetts, is collaborating with IBM Food Trust, a digital system for tracing food between retailers and suppliers.  A fleet of scallopers owned by Capt. Danny Eilersten will upload data about each catch sourced in a local fishing ground onto the blockchain platform, IBM announced on Thursday.  When Eilersten’s boats catch a scallop, the system records its weight, the vessel’s longitude, latitude and name, and the time the shellfish was caught, and sends the data via satellite to IBM’s blockchain. Workers on-board then store the scallops in a bag and label it with a barcode that links to the same information.  The project also shares data with distributors, suppliers and retailers, including when a boat landed port-side and when each scallop lot was hand graded, selected, packed and shipped to its final destination. Raw Seafoods plans to launch a mobile app allowing customers to access scallop provenance starting this November.  “The big picture for us is to have consumers have more trust in the seafood they’re eating,” Daniel McQuade, vice president of marketing at Raw Seafoods, told CoinDesk. “We’re trying to solve the fear of fish in both restaurants and markets.”  Conservationist group Oceana recently tested 400 seafood samples from 250 U.S. locations for authenticity. It found that 20 percent were mislabeled. Imported seafood, which makes up the total majority consumed in the U.S., may be more susceptible to mislabeling because of the potential to pass off fish and gain higher profits, McQuade said.  Other participants in the Raw Seafoods project include Santa Monica Seafoods, a seafood distributor, and restaurants like TAPS Fish House and Brewery in Orange County, CA, and Santa Monica Seafoods Market & Cafes. Since its launch in Oct. 2018, IBM Food Trust has signed up 170 companies for its blockchain and conducted some 17 million transactions, said Suzanne Livingston, offering director for IBM Food Trust.  Fishing ships are required by law to record when they make trips, how many pounds they land, and when they return to port, making distributed database technology a natural fit. The IBM Food Trust system also allows Raw Seafoods to buy product directly from fishers as opposed to from auctions or depots. Fishers can send images and videos along with the data for customers to see when the seafood plant’s app launches.  McQuade hopes the system will also help fisheries manage their scallop stocks more effectively, matching up supply and demand.  He said:  “The government says this boat can go out only so many days a year and it can only go to certain areas. We know these stores are going to be very busy in November and December. We’ll actually go to the boat owner and say ‘hold onto some of your trips … versus you using all your trips in June and July.’”  Scallops image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/10/17/shellfish-plant-is-putting-scallops-on-ibms-food-tracking-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d44d19e4dca98a8d57c5da0b244b8a7701213675-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403383,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfr8A,1571310482,"Bitcoin Price May Test $7,750 as Selling Pressure Grows","View  Bitcoin's bearish daily candle close (UTC) on October 16 has increased the likelihood of further price drops.  The monthly chart has similarities to that of November 2018 when volumes favored a bullish outlook, before dropping to new yearly lows.  The bulls need to drive prices back above $8,300 quickly or risk conceding full market control to the bears in the short term.      Bitcoin is looking increasingly weak, having dropped nearly 2 percent on rising trading volumes Wednesday.  The top cryptocurrency by market value fell from $8,150 to $7,912 in the early U.S. trading hours on Wednesday before printing a UTC close at $7,996.  The price slide strengthened the case for a retest of recent lows near $7,750 put forward by Tuesday's bearish ""outside bar"" candle.  Moreover, as reported, selling pressure has been building in recent days following bitcoin's failure at the 200-day moving average hurdle on Oct. 11. The key MA is widely considered a barometer of the long-term trend.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $8,100 on Bitstamp, representing a marginal loss on the day.  Prices have recovered more than 2 percent from Wednesday's low near $7,920, but remain well below the 200-day MA, currently at $8,778. Therefore, the path of least resistance remains to the downside.  Daily chart  Wednesday's drop was backed by higher than average levels of bearish (red candle) volume and bolstered the already bearish technical setup represented by Tuesday's bearish outside bar candle.  The daily relative strength index (RSI), an indicator that provides a reading of overbought and oversold conditions on a particular asset over a particular time frame, has been suppressed beneath the neutral 50 line ever since losing altitude on Sept. 5. It's struggled to gain a bullish foothold ever since.  BTC, therefore, looks set to retest support levels located near $7,750. A violation there could prove costly, opening the doors for a deeper drop toward $7,200, as predicted by a few observers.  The onus is now heavily on buyers to drive prices back above $8,300 quickly or risk conceding full control to the bears in the immediate short-term.  Monthly chart        As the month of October matures, another key volume metric stands out on the larger time frames.  Bearish volume has been decreasing in parallel with price drops, which typically suggests stability for buyers as the markets look to equalize on seller exhaustion.  However, it is not uncommon in crypto for prices to ignore generally accepted theory, as seen in November of last year when prices broke to the downside from a bearish descending triangle pattern and had similar volume patterns as seen currently.  This only acts to strengthen the bearish bias when viewed from larger time frames, with the monthly RSI also on a downward move toward the aforementioned neutral 50 line, hinting at a continuation of the prevailing southward trend.  Macro pressures  Concerns of a global recession are mounting amid the U.S.-China trade war and levels of corporate debt are increasing, as noted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Wednesday.  Many analysts consider bitcoin a safe haven asset, yet the evidence for the claim is not conclusive and the cryptocurrency has been no stranger to the pressure felt across the broader global markets.  Risk sentiment will likely remain weak, possibly keeping BTC under pressure until a clearer agreement is sketched out between the world's two largest economies  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

In a press release on Wednesday, relating to a complaint filed Sept. 30., the CFTC said it's charging Nevada-based Circle Society and its operator David Gilbert Saffron with fraudulently soliciting and misappropriating investor funds, as well as registration violations.  Through his firm, Saffron offered binary options on forex and cryptocurrency pairs and is alleged to have fleeced investors for $11 million in dollars and bitcoin since 2017.  The complaint says Saffron fraudulently solicited funds from at least 14 individuals to participate in an investment pool operated by Circle Society, making false claims about his trading expertise and ""guaranteeing"" gains of up to 300 percent.  Instead of using participants’ investments to actually trade in binary options contracts, Saffron used the funds – diverted to his own crypto wallet – to pay other participants, ""in the manner of a Ponzi scheme."" The misappropriation of the funds was concealed with a tissue of lies, allegedly.  CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert said:  “Digital assets and other 21st century commodities hold great promise for our economy. Fraudulent schemes, like that alleged in this case, not only cheat innocent people out of their hard-earned money, but they threaten to undermine the responsible development of these new and innovative markets.”  A court has ordered the freezing of any assets held by Saffron and Circle Society, as well as the preservation of financial records. A hearing over the case will take place Oct. 29.  The CFTC is seeking to retrieve the funds contributed to the scheme, alongside penalties and permanent registration and trading bans. The agency hopes to return invested funds to victims, though it said it cannot guarantee the full value can be obtained from Saffron and his firm.

42403377,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfr2G,1571302813,"Venezuelan Migrants Are Using Bitcoin for Remittances, But There’s a Catch","In 2018, Deimer González packed his college diploma, clothes and a mobile wallet with 1.5 BTC in savings and left Venezuela. What unfolded throughout 2019 offers a microcosm for Venezuelan bitcoin users around the world.  As a mechanical engineer from Caracas, formerly employed by Venezuela’s state-owned oil and natural gas company (PDVSA), González told CoinDesk that those very same savings allowed him to support his parents as he started to build a new life in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  “I was always able to send money back thanks to my savings, sparing my wages in pesos,” he said.  With an estimated $3.7 billion in remittances sent in 2019, money from abroad is an increasingly large source of income for Venezuelan families. As such, bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have assumed a larger role in facilitating cross-border transactions.  Additionally, migrants are using crypto during the relocation process itself, since it’s often hard for jobless immigrants to access financial services in their new countries.  Such is the case with Wolfang Barrios, a trader from Caracas who told CoinDesk about his experience arriving in Chile without savings in the local currency. Said Barrios:  “I didn’t have a stable job, enough money or a bank account. I could send the remittances only using crypto.""  Plus, supporting a family in Venezuela isn’t easy, even with dollars. In May, Venezuelan economist Luis Oliveros placed the cost of living in the country as high as $900 a month for a family of five, with a basic food basket costing roughly $300 a month. For context, the minimum wage in Venezuela is currently equivalent to $15 a month, though economists suspect this rate won’t last long.  In González’s case, neither his prior $5 monthly wage as a PDVSA worker nor his bitcoin remittances alone offer enough to support his family.  “Now I send $50 [worth of bitcoin] and it’s still nothing,” he said, adding that both his parents currently must work to sustain themselves, without further plans to move out of Venezuela.  The remittance business  Perhaps because of all these challenges, crypto-remittance businesses could start to bloom in Venezuela.  One such entrepreneur, who asked to be identified only by his first name Jesús, works for the Peru-Venezuela remittance platform Local Remesas.  “We receive between $200,000 and $300,000 a month,” he said, explaining how the platform currently trades pesos for bitcoin, to be later exchanged for bolivares in Venezuela.  As it turns out, niche fiat-to-crypto payment processing is a lucrative business in Venezuela.  According to Peru’s Migrations and Immigrations Police, the country is the second choice for Venezuelan immigrants, with over 865,000 arrivals to date. Even Nicolás Maduro’s government recently launched its own remittances platform, which uses the blockchain-based Petro (PTR).  As for Jesús, he said the trick to exchanging at the best rate is to use direct contacts:  “LocalBitcoins is about 3 percent more expensive than using my own contacts.""  Here’s the catch  However, for many of these bitcoin users, crypto payments are merely a last resort.  A daily inflation rate of 3 percent and the constant devaluation of the bolivar has made the exchange of bitcoin very useful for those living in Venezuela. But elsewhere in Latin America, some bitcoin users prefer to use fiat as soon as the situation is tenable.  Mariluna De La Concha, a Venezuelan crypto advocate living in México, told CoinDesk that she sent remittances in crypto to her family from 2016 until early 2019. Now she only sends pesos to her mother.  “It’s not convenient to exchange crypto,” she said. “In Venezuela it has good value due to inflation, but it’s very expensive for me from here.”  Her choice to use those expensive-but-compliant exchange platforms was also a matter of safety. Cases of fraud have been reported anonymously in Venezuelan private chats, where American bank accounts of Venezuelan users get reported and blocked after a transaction.  An anonymous source told CoinDesk there’s even the suspicion that exchange platforms’ transactions are being tracked by government police to extort bitcoin users.  For González, the mechanical engineer who fled in 2018, the situation has prompted him to switch to sending more fiat currency back home. Said González:  “I’m more of a [bitcoin] holder now.""

42403374,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfqwM,1571299235,"Fed Governor Brainard Identifies Libra Threat, Says Regulatory Hurdles Abound","Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard delivered a sharp critique of Libra on Wednesday, stating the Facebook-led project would need to resolve a number of regulatory hurdles before going live.  In a transcript of speech delivered on Wednesday at  The Future of Money in the Digital Age forum in Washington, D.C., Brainard outlined how global stablecoin projects raised complex regulatory issues that at best could delay Libra's anticipated 2020 launch, and, if left unresolved, place consumers and the international banking order at heightened risk.  The problem? Stablecoins could be too successful – perhaps even rivaling central bank-issued cash.  “If a large share of domestic households and businesses come to rely on a global stablecoin not only as a means of payment but also as a store of value,” it could impact central banks' balance sheets, Brainard said.  Libra is in a unique position to accomplish this, with direct access to Facebook’s gargantuan user base - “a third of the global population,” she noted; and perhaps more, given that Libra plans to be available to individuals off the social network, too.  But for all those potential users, Brainard cast doubt that regulatory answers were there.  Those consumers might not understand their digital wallet rights, she said. And neither do the regulators who have built a firewall of consumer protections around traditional bank accounts, from insuring deposits to holding financial institutions liable for fraud.  “Not only is it not clear whether comparable protections will be in place with Libra, or what recourse consumers will have, but it is not even clear how much price risk consumers will face since they do not appear to have rights to the stablecoin's underlying assets.”  Libra’s plans to be “opaquely tied to a basket of sovereign currencies” further complicate matters because it is unclear what right users and holders would have to those underlying assets, if any.  In conclusion, she said:  “It should be no surprise that Facebook's Libra is attracting a high level of scrutiny from lawmakers and authorities.”  Debating the Digital Dollar  Her speech also touched on what an 'active' debate within the Federal Reserve: the merits of the U.S. issuing a ""Central Bank Digital Currency"" – a digital dollar.  Brainard, who has downplayed the need for U.S.-backed crypto in the past, continued to argue for that side, and on a number of levels: its implications on monetary policy, operational security risks, threat to financial stability. Even its ramifications on user privacy.  ""If [a digital dollar] is designed to be financially transparent and provide safeguards against illicit activity, a central bank digital currency for consumer use could conceivably require the central bank to keep a running record of all payment data using the digital currency—a stark difference from cash, for instance.""  But she said that Fed would continue to consider a digital dollar's pros and cons.

42403367,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfqsQ,1571292010,Samsung SDS Pilots Blockchain-Based Medical Insurance Network,"Samsung SDS, an IT solution developer partially owned by the South Korean tech conglomerate, is expecting to roll out a blockchain-based medical claims processing system this month.  According to a CoinDesk Korea report on Wednesday, Yoon Shim, a vice president of Samsung SDS, said at the Blockchain Seoul 2019 event that the firm has been piloting the system since August this year. Samsung SDS is 22.6 percent owned by Samsung Electronics and 17.1 percent owned by Samsung C&T.  Yoon added that medical institutions and insurers have participated in the pilot to validate the effectiveness and the system will go live soon this month, based on another local news report.  The network being rolled out aims to simplify a now complex process, in which a patient gets a receipt for services rendered and submits the documents to the insurance company, which must then verify their accuracy before claims are paid.  The company says that even though most Koreans are well insured and should have no out-of-pocket expenses, they will often not file claims because of the complicated procedures.  In the new ""blockchain healthcare network,"" hospitals, pharmacies, insurers and other companies in the sector will be linked. When the system is operational, users will receive a message on the KakaoTalk messenger after treatment. They can then press a receipt button and an insurance claim button, after which their information is sent to the insurer.  Blockchain technology is used for the sharing of personal medical information. Samsung SDS believes that the network will reduce the workload at medical institutions, shorten wait times for claims processing and reduce the cost of processing medical claims by up to 70 percent.  In June, Samsung SDS said that it had already signed a number of major hospitals to the blockchain healthcare network. The list includes Samsung Hospital, Severance Hospital and Korea University Medical Center, while discussions were ongoing with other institutions. The company said at the time that the new system would be rolled out in August 2019.  The network is being built on Nexledger, an enterprise blockchain platform originally developed in 2017. Samsung SDS says Nexledger is being used in the implementation of 110 blockchain projects and holds 51 patents.
