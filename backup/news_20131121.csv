42376730,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6clDn,1385057410,Bitcoin Auction Site Puts Itself Up for Sale After Theft of 15 Bitcoins,"Another day, another bitcoin-related story of a hacking intrusion and BTC theft.  According to people that have provided documentation to CoinDesk, as well as information posted on the Bitcointalk forum, the auction site Bitmit had 15 BTC stolen, after the server was accessed by an employee of their hosting company without authorization.  This theft, along with the effort and responsibility of securing an auction site that has escrow functionality, were the two largest factors in Bitmit announcing that it is being sold.  And although 15 BTC does not sound like a large number, at current CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) values, that's almost $10,000.  Bitmit, known as the 'eBay of bitcoin', has had a string of setbacks since its inception. After the theft the site has remained online, albeit with the header ""Bitmit is going to be sold. Please complete your orders and withdraw your funds asap!""  ""We are planning to let another company take over Bitmit. Meanwhile we deactivated the site to let you withdraw your funds & complete your orders. The chances are good that Bitmit will be continued.""  The scams and frauds that have cropped up around bitcoin as a new type of monetary technology have been numerous. Earlier this week, members of the US Senate held hearings regarding the risks that decentralized virtual currencies pose to the financial system.  Bitcoin-based auction sites like Bitmit often take escrow payments and hold the funds until an item arrives. And although escrow could become a big part of bitcoin being a reliable system of payment, the currency's unregulated nature makes it a somewhat risky proposition.  ""Neither Bitmit nor any of the new bitcoin auction sites should be trusted to hold the escrow funds of their users,"" said Michael McNeff, owner of new auction site Half Price Digital. Half Price Digital does not provide escrow services and could gain market share after Bitmit's closure.  ""The new auction sites will either be hacked, shut down for not having an escrow license, the nameless owners will abscond with their users' bitcoins, or the owners will sell the site (and their users' BTC) possibly without their users' knowledge to another party,"" McNeff said.  The business of bitcoin hacking and theft continues to thrive. Just recently, a Polish bitcoin/litecoin exchange was hacked, and wallets were subsequently emptied. And Slovenia-based Bitstamp, ranked third in the world by bitcoin trading volume according to Bitcoincharts, has experienced issues which crippled trades.  After the the regulatory hot potato was raised at the virtual currency hearing at the US Senate this week, could bitcoin escrow services be next in line for licensing? McNeff stresses those transacting in bitcoin using escrow should be wary, at least for the time being, unless there is some licensing involved.  ""None of the other bitcoin auction sites have a legitimate registered company and the reason for this is simple: they are all running unlicensed escrow services which make them a prime target for hackers and risk being shut down by regulators.""

42376714,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ckxR,1385051690,Dutch Bank Rabobank is Blocking Customers from Buying Bitcoins,"Editor's note: Marc van der Chijs is a former Dutch serial entrepreneur in Shanghai turned venture capitalist in Vancouver. He lived and worked for over 13 years in China, where he co-founded popular online video sharing site Tudou.com. He is a big believer in bitcoin.  It seems banks have started to realize that bitcoin could be a major threat for them.  In the US many banks don't accept any bitcoin businesses as clients, possibly because of regulatory concerns and money laundering risks.  Individuals aren't free from bitcoin banking issues either. CoinDesk reported recently that a Swedish bank froze a customer's account for selling just 5 BTC.  Now it is the Netherlands' turn. A bank has taken matters a step further and simply blocked most of its customers from buying bitcoins at exchanges.  According to an article in the Dutch press, Rabobank cancelled 99% of its customers’ transactions with bitcoin exchanges on Tuesday and Wednesday.  Rabobank did not give a reason for this, but a spokesperson for Dutch bitcoin exchange BTCNext said it was because transactions are seen as potential fraud.  However, many clients of Rabobank could not finalize and complete their transaction, even after calling to confirm that their transfers were not fraudulent.  Coincidentally, I have an account at Rabobank that I have used to buy bitcoins. This worked well until September, but after that transactions did not get processed reliably. I assumed it was problem with the bitcoin exchange I was using, and accepted that I could not buy additional coins.  I now wonder if the bank may have been behind this issue all along. Could it be that the Rabobank has been intervening in its client’s transactions for far longer than just the past two days?  Technical problems, really?  Because the bank claimed that the problems were technical and had been solved, I decided to try to buy five bitcoins just now through Rabobank.  The transaction went through until the moment I hit the pay button. Then I got an error message saying that my account number was not correct.  I tried this several times and each time I got the same error. Then I tried to transfer a small amount to someone else as a test, and guess what? The transaction went through right away! So Rabobank is still not allowing people to buy bitcoin.  I understand why a bank would try to do this, of course. This is money that people may normally leave in their savings accounts. When a customer decides to use it to purchase bitcoin the bank has less money on its books, meaning that they can't lend out as much as before. If just a few people would do this, it would not be a big issue. But when the general public starts to adopt bitcoin it could endanger part of the bank's business.  Banks need to innovate and embrace bitcoin  If I was running a bank, I would not try to stop bitcoin, but instead actively look at embracing the cryptocurrency.  Why not set up or buy a bitcoin exchange, or create an easy-to-use wallet and make sure that people keep their bitcoin deposits with you? Not only would it be great PR, but it could create a lot of new customers as well.  I understand that banks are conservative, but they are making the same mistakes as the music and newspaper industries did over the past ten years.  You can't stop financial innovation. If you can't beat them, then you’d better join them.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Marc van der Chijs,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/21/dutch-bank-rabobank-is-blocking-customers-from-buying-bitcoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cbd2bb0143accd0e3d7063af96235034c23335b3-1152x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376731,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6clF3,1385035891,Pay in Bitcoin for a Plot in Chilean Libertarian Paradise,"A libertarian-fashioned community in Chile is now accepting bitcoins in exchange for plots of land within its boundaries.  The project is called Galt's Gulch Chile, a name inspired by the character John Galt in Ayn Rand's landmark novel Atlas Shrugged. Galt decided he no longer wanted to support a society that was oppressed, over taxed and over regulated, so created his own community.  Galt's Gulch Chile is designed to be a fully self-sustaining community that is situated in a coastal mountain range 10 miles north of Curacaví, which isn't far from Chile's capital Santiago.  The 11,000-acre site was purchased in two trances, with the most recent purchase of 6,874 acres taking place in August.  The land is home to abundant supply of fresh clean water, sourced from over fifty wells, two underground aquifers, canals, two rivers, a manmade lake and a number of natural springs.  Ken Johnson, managing partner of the Galt's Gulch Chile project, said: ""We chose Chile for its economic freedoms, as well as its freedom in general.""  He went on to say that the climate, people and the culture in Chile are all ""wonderful"", adding:  ""We aren't seeking to become a sovereign state, or city, as others have proposed in the past. We are simply offering a safe and prosperous place for people to come together and enjoy life in an economic climate that nobody has ever experienced before.""  Organic farming  There is a 250-acre farm on the recently purchased land, which is being subdivided into five 25-acre lemon orchards and a 125-acre Galt's Gulch Organic Farm.  The community will use the farm to grow pesticide-free and non-GMO vegetables, fruits, nuts and spices, which will be sold worldwide under the brand Galt's Gulch Organics.  Johnson said ""private funding mechanisms"" were used to raise the money required to buy the land and start creating the required infrastructure.  ""We have a very large amount of equity in our land, and even more so in our very large amount of registered water rights. Several banks have inquired about funding the project, so we intend to keep all options open with them as well,"" he added.  Johnson explained that around 20km of roads have been created in the areas that will contain residential lots.  ""Power, water, irrigation, Internet, etc are all in on a good portion of the land, with the remaining lines to be installed in the coming months, as all roads and lots are approved,"" he added.  Land for sale  Galt's Gulch Chile's website lists 1.25-acre, 2.5-acre and five-acre lots for sale at $75,000, $128,500 and $195,000, respectively. The price in bitcoin is not listed on the site.  Johnson said the money from the lots sold will be used to acquire more land, plus fund infrastructure development and operations.  People have been stung by scams involving bitcoin recently, so many may be reluctant to part with such a large amount of currency for a slice of a community that some would say sounds too good to be true.  ""Those who have been to our Spring Celebration, and/or have toured our project, know that the project is not a scam and is quite real,"" said Johnson.  He went on to say that the community has been built upon free market principles and the members and founders intend to keep it that way.  Bitcoin  Jeff Berwick, spokesperson for Galt's Gulch Chile, said: ""I can think of no better way to invest bitcoins than on real estate, especially legally protected land with clean water and organic farmland in quickly developing markets, like Chile.""  Berwick, who is founder of StockHouse and TDV Media, went on to say he believes that, just like bitcoins, land in emerging markets will only increase in value over the coming years.  [post-quote]  ""The US dollar and other fiat currencies will continue to collapse and we recommend those holding dollars to divest themselves of those dollars as soon as possible. We also want to show our commitment to bitcoin and accept it very happily as payment for land at Galt’s Gulch,"" he added.  Similarities can be drawn between Galt's Gulch Chile and the Free State Project (FSP) in the US. Like Galt's Gulch Chile, the aim of this project is to create a libertarian community, however, the members of the FSP are not building their homes and infrastructure from scratch.  The aim of this political migration is to get 20,000 libertarians to move to New Hampshire to create a stronghold for libertarian ideas.  Vanessa Vine, co-organiser of New Hampshire's PorcFest (the Porcupine Freedom Festival), said bitcoin is “huge” within FSP and is a focus of any FSP-related event.  Freedom  The Galt's Gulch website claims people of all ages, professions and walks of life have enquired about becoming residents, including engineers, doctors, artists, craftsmen, teachers, retirees, farmers and families with children.  ""Freedom is a popular product and service!"" the site states.  Those living in the community aren't completely free from taxes and charges, they will have to pay quarterly fees, although these are referred to as being ""very low"". These will be used for the upkeep of features such as gated security, staffing for clubhouses, landscape maintenance for common areas and upkeep of community roads.  Residents will also have to check whether they are required to pay income tax, VAT, real estate tax and stamps tax.  ""We fully intend to report all income to the project, so as to abide by all Chilean laws,"" said Johnson.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/21/pay-in-bitcoin-for-a-plot-in-chilean-libertarian-paradise,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cb58f1ffa6fcf8dfc300534b73c4f030567cbd8c-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376723,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cl6F,1385030033,University of Nicosia in Cyprus Becomes First in the World to Accept Bitcoin,"The University of Nicosia in Cyprus has announced that it will accept bitcoin for the payment of tuition and other fees.  The university, also known as UNic, is not only the first accredited university in the world to accept bitcoin from its students, but is also launching a Master of Science degree in Digital Currency in Spring 2014.  UNic's Chief Financial Officer Dr. Christos Vlachos believes in the virtues of bitcoin, stating:  “We are acutely aware that digital currency is an inevitable technical development that will lead to significant innovation in online commerce, financial systems, international payments and remittances and global economic development.""  Vlachos also believes that digital currency will ""create more efficient services and serve as a mechanism for spreading financial services to under-banked regions of the world.""  UNic's initial impetus for accepting bitcoin came from receiving requests from online students in such under-banked countries, with Vlachos noting Kenya as a prime example.  After looking into it some more, the administration decided that bitcoin was faster, cheaper, easier and more convenient, and decided to offer it as an option for its students.  Garrick Hileman, economic historian at the London School of Economics, suggested that UNic's move is a sign of growth in bitcoin's credibility as a medium of exchange at more traditional institutions.  [post-quote]  He added: ""The most fertile ground for bitcoin is in places like Cyprus, Argentina, Iceland, China and other countries which have experienced significant financial disruptions and/or maintain strict financial controls.""  When questioned about its decision in light of bitcoin's recent volatility, a university spokesperson told GeekWire: “The intention of this initiative is to ease transmission difficulties for certain students and to build our own practical knowledge about this field, not to engage in currency speculation.”  Founded in 1980, the University of Nicosia is the largest private university in Cyprus, with campuses across three of its cities and over 8,500 students in total across its affiliated institutions. It is also one of the largest universities in the Mediterranean region of Europe.  UNic also plans to lobby the Cypriot Government for a framework to develop Cyprus into a hub for bitcoin exchange, trading and banking.  The bitcoin price saw a massive surge to $266 in April during the financial crisis in Cyprus.  Paul Smocer, president of BITS, which promotes discussion of technology issues for the financial services industry, mentioned discussed the influx of interest in digital currencies that resulted from the crisis this at a recent US Senate hearing on bitcoin.  In the past few weeks, the bitcoin price has soared to even greater highs, and remains high despite some recent fluctuations.  UNic may be the first accredited university to accept bitcoin, but other educational services have already embraced the digital currency.  Earlier in the year Khan Academy launched a series of educational bitcoin videos and announced it is accepting donations in bitcoin. Draper 'entrepreneur heroes' University, a VC-founded school for entrepreneurs based in Silicon Valley, also has a tuition programme that accepts bitcoin.

42376710,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cksP,1385024678,Alpha Technology Announces ASIC Miners for Litecoin are Coming Soon,"Manchester, UK-based Alpha Technology has announced it will start developing the first purpose-built ASIC mining hardware for litecoin, signing a partnership deal with Indian designer and manufacturer Dexcel Designs.  The company announced it would begin taking pre-orders for affordable and efficient litecoin ASICs in December, for shipping in early/mid 2014.  Alpha Technology is providing its mining and cryptocurrency expertise while Dexcel Designs will handle hardware development, production, and quality assurance.  It would represent a significant increase in computing power backing the litecoin network. At present, most mining of the world’s second most popular cryptocurrency still takes place on regular graphics cards/GPUs (as did bitcoin previously).  Alpha Technology has been working with Bangalore-based Dexcel Designs for about six months, beginning with a FPGA (field-programmable gate array) conceptualization of litecoin’s primary scrypt hashing algorithm before designing dedicated ASIC hardware.  Why litecoin?  Mohammed Akram, CEO of Alpha Technology, spoke about the development process and why his company has decided to throw its weight behind litecoin.  “We decided to go down the litecoin/scrypt path for a few reasons. One is that we believe bitcoin has enough ASIC manufacturers, to us it's all about innovation and the next step,"" he said.  “Bitcoin has enough ASIC manufacturers to secure the network for the years ahead, someone needs to replace GPUs with purpose-built hardware for the much weaker litecoin hashrate. Decentralization is key to these cryptocurrencies, that's why it would be beneficial to litecoin to have more ASIC manufacturers down the line.”  Akram is devoted to the concept of cryptocurrencies in general and, like others, compares their current state of development and application to the early internet.  But “you can’t put all your eggs in one basket,” he claimed, predicting litecoin would grow in acceptance as more services were created around it, and its own network became more secure.  He is also a former miner himself, and noticed litecoin was a few points more profitable than bitcoin using the older GPUs.  “What most miners care about is ROI and profit. Since we expect to be the earliest to market and distribute, miners will probably feel more confident purchasing our miner simply because their isn't a huge arms race yet in litecoin ASIC, so they can be confident that until their miners arrive their won't be a influx of hash rate from specialized hardware, so ROI is more easily predictable.”  Akram believes litecoin will become a more popular alternative to bitcoin as bitcoin becomes more valuable, referring to the (controversial) view that litecoin can be the silver to bitcoin’s gold.  To make its big mainstream break, he said, litecoin first needed a secure and effective payment processor like BitPay. Alpha Technology itself accepts payment via PayPal, bank transfer or bitcoin.  “We want to accept litecoin, but due to the high amount of sales we expect, we cannot risk the fluctutations in litecoin. Until a payment processor like BitPay is built for litecoin. I’m not talking about a general payment processor, I’m talking where we can get an equal value of fiat sent to our bank the following day. There needs to be some sort of connection or deal with a large exchange to accomplish this.”  Alpha Technology is a “family-involved business” including accountants and software experts as well as Akram, an electronic engineer.  While it is initially dedicated to ASIC-based cryptocurrency mining, its longer-term vision would see it merge with the family’s accounting firm, M. Akram & Co., to hopefully become “the main UK specialist in cryptocurrency tax and accounting services.”  Hardware  Alpha Technology originally wanted its finished product to be an FPGA and developed an in-depth implementation of the scrypt algorithm, but found the cost of manufacturing would be too high. Even with FPGAs’ efficiency benefits, lower-priced GPUs would still be more profitable.  It was previously thought ASIC hardware wouldn’t offer any benefit to litecoin mining, with scrypt’s need for fast access to large amounts of memory with each hash attempt (though litecoin was also originally meant to be GPU-resistant as well).  Alpha Technology conducted analysis into each aspect of the scrypt algorithm and, using FPGAs instead as a prototyping tool, now says it is targeting around 500 kilohashes per ASIC chip (each device will have several chips). The company will release more detailed final figures “in a few weeks”.  If that sounds low to all the bitcoin miners out there, it’s because litecoin (for now) requires far less hash rates to produce a return on investment.  Bringing ASIC mining hardware onto the litecoin scene offers a big advantage over GPU miners, as they did for bitcoin miners comparatively recently.  India’s Dexcel Designs  Dexcel Designs’ CEO Amit Sinha is a fan of cryptocurrencies and believes India can seize the opportunity to develop as a ‘potential hotspot’, as he said in a column for The Hindu just before the partnership was announced.  Lack of government intervention in India so far “has given an opportunity for the cryptocurrency community in India to expand, develop cryptocurrency-related businesses in the space, and educate people on the opportunities for economic growth associated with cryptocurrencies,” he wrote.  Dexcel Designs itself is a high-end embedded product engineering company with fabless OEM/ODM Box build capability.  In its 13-year history it has worked on several state of the art designs in software and systems architecture including ASICs, FPGAs , and DSPs both in India and through other partnerships internationally.  Although litecoin’s value against bitcoin has dropped by over 50% in the past few months, its value and market cap in fiat currencies has risen.  One litecoin is (at the time of writing) worth $8.65, with a total market cap of $200,791,400 (according to coinmarketcap.com). There are currently over 23 million litecoins in existence, compared to bitcoin’s 12+ million.  Litecoin will be limited eventually to 84 million coins (compared to bitcoin’s 21 million total). It is available as a trading option on some major exchanges such as BTC-e, but is not as widely accepted by merchants yet.
