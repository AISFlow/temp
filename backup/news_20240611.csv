However, despite the temporary setback, the optimistic sentiment surrounding TON and its network has led crypto analysts to speculate on a potential continuation of the halted uptrend, with some even predicting a surge beyond the current record levels toward double-digit territory. Setting The Stage For $10 Price Target Crypto analysis firm Delphi Digital made an intriguing observation, noting that TON’s daily active addresses have surpassed those of Ethereum (ETH) for the first time. Related Reading: Blood In The Water? Ethereum Whales Circle As Price Drops This surge in activity is attributed to the substantial 900 million user base of Telegram, the social media platform behind TON. Delphi Digital recognizes that TON’s success hinges on leveraging Telegram’s distribution capabilities. In a recent social media post, renowned crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi) analyst known as “Crypto King” recommended newcomers to explore TON, highlighting its super-fast and user-friendly blockchain infrastructure. The analyst also emphasized the credibility of TON’s development team, which is the same team behind Telegram. Crypto King believes TON could experience a significant price spike, potentially reaching as high as $10 in the coming weeks. Market expert Alex Clay shares a similar viewpoint, noting that despite the market downturn, TON maintains its bullish structure and is poised for double-digit gains. According to Clay, TON is on track to reach $10, with the potential for short-term targets of $10.5 and $11.6. Clay also mentions the presence of a Daily Cup & Handle pattern, further bolstering the positive outlook for TON. Toncoin Price Dips Despite Favorable Market Metrics Token Terminal data reveals notable figures for TON’s blockchain by examining key metrics that indicate bullishness over the long term. The fully diluted market cap has seen a 3.6% increase over the past 30 days. However, trading volume for the token has decreased by 11.6% over the same period. On the other hand, the number of token holders has witnessed a significant surge of 76.3%. In terms of revenue and fees, there have been positive increases of 26.0% and 26.0% respectively over the past 30 days. Interestingly, the active user base on TON’s network has skyrocketed by an impressive 245.1%, with approximately 5.42 million monthly active users. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crashes Below $67,000: Key Reasons Despite the positive growth seen in various metrics over the past 30 days, Toncoin has experienced a 3% decrease in price during the same timeframe, resulting in a current trading price of $6.82.

Conversely, the nearest resistance level is $7.53, representing the last obstacle before a potential retest of Toncoin’s all-time high.

Here Is What Futures Data Signals,"Recent data from CryptoQuant has revealed a bearish phase for Ethereum (ETH), as futures traders exhibit strong selling activity. The crypto community closely monitors these developments, especially with Ethereum struggling to hold above the $3,500 mark, adding tension to an already volatile market. Related Reading: Blood In The Water? Ethereum Whales Circle As Price Drops Ethereum Market Sentiments And Technical Indicators Data from CryptoQuant has shed light on the current market conditions for Ethereum, suggesting a potential continuation of the current downtrend. The analysis focuses on the ‘Taker Buy Sell Ratio,’ a key indicator of market sentiment in the futures arena. This metric assesses the balance of buying versus selling activity; a ratio above 1 indicates dominance by buyers, reflecting stronger buying pressure, while a value below 1 highlights aggressive selling. Unfortunately for Ethereum investors and enthusiasts, this ratio has recently dipped below 1, signaling that sellers are overpowering buyers. This downtrend is mirrored by the significant drop in the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, which has steeply declined, showing a clear shift toward seller dominance. Such aggressive selling could stem from traders aiming to capitalize on speculative gains or seeking to mitigate risks amidst heightened market volatility. $ETH‘s plummet might persist in the short term “This trend suggests that the majority of futures traders have been selling #Ethereum aggressively, either for speculative purposes or to realize profits.” – By @Greatest_Trader Link 👇https://t.co/yz9DVphQ8l — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 11, 2024 The persistence of this trend is a concerning signal for Ethereum’s short-term price outlook as it struggles to find support levels that could stabilize its value. The crypto analyst, Shayan BTC, who posted this update on the CryptoQuant quick-take platform, particularly noted: This significant drop in the metric is a bearish signal, suggesting that the current downward retracement could persist if this trend continues. Implications: ETH’s Current Trading Behaviour The bearish indicators are more than a fleeting concern; they have tangible impacts on Ethereum’s market position. Over the past week, Ethereum has seen a 2% decline, with a sharper drop of nearly 6% in the last 24 hours alone, bringing its price down to $3,471. This correction follows a recent high of nearly $4,000 in late May, illustrating the volatile swings that can affect investor sentiment and market dynamics. Furthermore, Ethereum’s challenges are compounded by the rise of competing platforms like Polygon, which recently reported a higher monthly active user count than Ethereum. MAU (Monthly Active Users) on @0xPolygon surpassed Ethereum. Probably nothing. https://t.co/bpxIxu7ZcF — Mihailo Bjelic (@MihailoBjelic) June 11, 2024 While this does not directly influence Ethereum’s price, it signals shifting preferences within the blockchain ecosystem, potentially diverting attention and investment from Ethereum.

Spot ETF conversion ended that arb for GBTC holders. The same trend is now happening to the Grayscale Ethereum Trust which now offers just a 1.5% discount to NAV. I discuss the SEC's pivot on spot Ethereum ETFs, the opportunity cost of investing in ETHE, and estimated spot ETH ETF inflows. I've been covering the crypto trust products from Grayscale Investments for Seeking Alpha going back to late 2019. As closed end funds that are backed by digital assets, these tickers have been a wild ride for investors, to say the least. In the time since I first covered the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ), we've seen Grayscale's crypto funds trade massive premiums, enormous discounts, and in many instances premiums once again . In one week from the time of this article submission, the Seeking Alpha Investing Summit will take place in New York. One of the first panel discussions is titled ""A New Age For Crypto."" Grayscale’s Managing Director and Head of Distribution and Strategic Partnerships John Hoffman will be on that panel. This is perhaps serendipitous timing given the recent 19b-4 approvals from the Securities and Exchange Commission for spot Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) ETFs in the United States. The SEC Pivots Just as it did with spot Bitcoin (BTC-USD) ETFs, the SEC has changed its tune on spot Ethereum ETFs. While it should be noted 19b-4s have been approved for 8 different funds, the S-1s have yet to receive SEC approval and it isn't clear when the spot ETH ETFs will begin trading. However, what is clear is that spot ETH ETFs are coming to the United States market. Given the SEC's apparent pivot on spot Ethereum ETFs, the question becomes how can Ethereum-bulls best play ETF conversion from here? Data by YCharts After GBTC's conversion to an ETF earlier this year, the once powerful arbitrage trade in Grayscale's flagship product is now over. This is because ETFs have a redemption mechanism that allow funds to be withdrawn from the fund manager if the price of the shares don't perform in line with the underlying assets. Grayscale's successful conversion of GBTC from a closed end fund to an ETF ended the fund's discount. The same is now happening to the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ) and I'd argue the buy case for ETHE has diminished because of it. ETHE is a viable way to get exposure to Ethereum. However for arbitrage traders, the fund's eventual conversion to an ETF has been essentially priced-in after the discount closed from more than 25% to less than 2% in a matter of just a few sessions. Given the volatility of the underlying asset, the current 1.5% discount to NAV is likely much less exciting for arbitrage traders. Predicting ETH Fund Flow All that said, the lack of a juicy pricing arb doesn't necessarily eliminate the case for holding ETHE as a simple ETH proxy for those bullish Ethereum more broadly. If the spot ETH ETFs are anything like the spot BTC ETFs earlier this year, the underlying asset will perform quite well when investment capital can be allocated to the spot products. Spot ETF Supply (Author's table, BitcoinTreasuries.Net) In the time since the approval of spot BTC ETFs in January, more than 264k of net BTC has come into traditional financial products, even adjusting for the 54% decline in GBTC Bitcoin supply. At current Bitcoin prices, this net inflow has a market valuation of $17.7 billion. Data by YCharts Due in large part to this investor demand, the price of BTC has appreciated by as much as 50% since the spot products were approved. However, I view it as unlikely that Ethereum will generate the same level of investor interest as Bitcoin, considering ETH has a more dynamic coin supply and is seen more as ""digital gas"" than as digital ""gold."" But if we use Grayscale's pre-ETF AUM data as an indication for how much investor demand, there may be for spot Ethereum ETFs, we can attempt a back of the envelope guess on how much fund flow ETH holders can expect for spot ETFs in the future. Full Year Flows/AUM (CoinShares) If we take out the year to date crypto investment inflows as presented by CoinShares and judge investor demand purely on AUM figures from the end of 2023, ETH accounted for about 27% of the AUM that Bitcoin did at $9.9 billion. More recently, Bitcoin has enjoyed $16.7 billion in net investment capital inflow this year: Crypto Investor Flow (CoinShares) This capital flow has added more than $20 billion in AUM through a rerating of the BTC that was already held in Bitcoin investment products at the end of last year. But if we divide the $16.7 billion of inflow by the $36.2 billion in AUM that was already allocated to BTC last year, we get about a 46% organic pop in AUM post-spot approvals. Applying that same percentage to the current $15.6 billion in AUM for Ethereum today would be about $7.2 billion in new investor demand. Some may argue that there simply aren't as many ETH bulls as there are BTC bulls, and that would probably be a fair statement. Perhaps the more logical way to estimate ETH investment flow following spot ETFs would be to assume the 27% ETH to BTC AUM ratio that preceded the spot BTC approvals. If we take the $16.7 billion of net capital flow into spot BTC ETFs year to date and assume 27% of that figure will be allocated to spot ETH ETFs upon approval, we get an investor demand figure closer to $4.5 billion. All of this said, Ethereum has arguably carried far more regulatory risk than Bitcoin has in the United States due to the SEC's unwillingness to directly state whether the agency views ETH as a security or not. Spot ETF approvals would figure to dramatically mitigate regulatory risk in ETH domestically, which could result in a net flow story that is far greater than my estimates above. ETH Supply (Ultrasound.money) But if our base case for ETH investment flow following spot ETF approvals in the United States is somewhere between $4.5-7.2 billion, we should observe a similar 40-50% price ramp to new all time highs in ETH as we saw in BTC earlier this year. There simply isn't enough new ETH supply coming into the market to soak up all of that demand, and the coin has actually been deflationary since September 2022. The Drawbacks In Longing ETHE ETHE might be a good way to bet on price appreciation in Ethereum, but it isn't the best, in my view. For long term investors, there are other options. Investors can just buy ETH directly through an exchange like Coinbase ( COIN ) and not pay Grayscale's 2.5% annual fee. Self-custody is the best way to mitigate third party risk and if investors are planning to simply sit on the assets for several years, holding ETH directly may be the better alternative. For tax-advantaged holding, there are alternatives as well. There are several crypto IRA offerings available to US customers that don't charge annual fees for Ethereum positions. The one I use charges 1% fees on buys and sells. But if an investor is planning to hold the asset for longer than a year, holding ETH through a crypto IRA is still more cost-effective than holding ETHE in a Roth. ETH Staking Rate, 1 yr (StakingRewards.com) Finally, ETHE assets are not staked and there's an opportunity cost there for self-custody advocates. At a current reward rate of 3.6% for staking on-chain, the 2.5% annual fee that ETHE holders pay to Grayscale implies a 6.1% annual opportunity cost in longing ETHE over directly buying and staking Ethereum oneself. Summary It's an exciting time to be a crypto investor. Since the collapse of FTX, US regulators have taken a far more antagonistic view on the industry. This combative approach to crypto domestically has created an environment where crypto users have become a significant voting block in America, and Washington has seemingly taken notice. Rather than push young voters to former President Donald Trump, the current administration is now actively courting these voters and has taken a less combative tone. Whether either side are to be believed on their recent openness to the industry is not something I'll touch on in this summary. But the voter pressure is apparently being felt in Washington and that's a good thing for crypto investors longer term in my view, if it leads to sensible regulation rather than choking out the industry. I believe we are indeed at the beginning of ""A New Age For Crypto"" in America, and I still maintain that Ethereum is one of the best ways to play that narrative. The arbitrage in ETHE may be over, but the fund will likely still serve as a viable ETH proxy for traders who exposure in tax-advantaged accounts.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4698713-grayscale-ethereum-trust-the-end-of-the-arb?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/29331020.jpeg

This comes despite Bitcoin’s recent drop below $68,000. Bitcoin Could Experience A Massive Pump Above $73,000 Dippy suggested in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin could enjoy a price pump once it reaches the liquidity zone around $73,000. He noted that many short traders have their stop losses or liquidation levels around that price level, which could be the catalyst for this price pump since liquidations of short positions can easily flush out the bears. Related Reading: Arbitrum DAO Agrees To Distribute $216 Million In Funding – Here’s What You Should Know The crypto analyst also outlined another scenario that could play out, which presents a bearish outlook for Bitcoin. He claimed that Bitcoin’s surge to this liquidity zone could be a fakeout to take liquidity and then move down again. However, Bitcoin experiencing that pump once it hits $73,000 looks more likely, considering that crypto analyst James Check labeled the $73,000 price level as where Bitcoin could enter an escape velocity phase. Crypto analyst Adrian Zduńczyk also suggested that Bitcoin would likely turn that $73,000 zone into support if it climbed to that level. He noted that Bitcoin has continued to consolidate inside its current ATH area for 14 weeks now, which is significant considering that this was an area where it had shown weakness before. Zduńczyk claims this is a “trend-promoting behavior” as resistance becomes the new support, and Bitcoin will continue to go higher. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto suggested that Bitcoin’s long-term consolidation in this range might be good, stating that the “longer the consolidation, the higher it moves when it breaks out.” He also remarked that Bitcoin’s bullish divergence also indicates “strong strength” for the flagship crypto. Mikybull Crypto expects Bitcoin to rise to $85,000 and then $110,000 when this long-awaited breakout happens. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital also noted that it is only a matter of time before the breakout happens. He had previously stated that a successful breakout for Bitcoin above the $70,000 range would send it into the ‘parabolic uptrend’ phase of this market cycle. Why BTC Dropped Below $68,000 Bitcoin dropped below $68,000 following the significant outflows the US Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded on June 10.

This indication emerges amidst a notable fluctuation in Bitcoin’s price, setting the stage for potential short-term gains. Renowned crypto analyst Ali has highlighted a significant development on the hourly chart of Bitcoin, specifically noting a ‘buy signal’ detected by the TD Sequential indicator. This technical tool, developed by Tom DeMark, is respected for its ability to predict price reversals by analyzing exhaustion points in trends. Related Reading: Buckle Up: Bitcoin’s Ride to $74K Could Start Any Minute – Here’s Why Decoding The TD Sequential Indicator On Bitcoin Chart The TD Sequential operates in two main phases: the setup and the countdown. The setup phase requires nine consecutive price bars closing progressively higher or lower, depending on the trend’s direction. Following a successful setup, the countdown phase begins, searching for a sequence of 13 bars that continue the trend but must close beyond the high or low of two bars prior. Completing this countdown typically signals an exhausted trend, poised for a reversal. Bitcoin’s hourly chart shows the completion of this pattern, suggesting an imminent uptick over the next few hours. The TD Sequential presents a buy signal on the #Bitcoin hourly chart, predicting a potential rebound of one to four candlesticks for $BTC! pic.twitter.com/pnAMFHHbPe — Ali (@ali_charts) June 11, 2024 This technical prognosis arrives as Bitcoin contends with downward pressure, recently dipping below $67,000, a price level not seen since late May. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $66,855, marking a 3.7% decline, which has sparked widespread commentary among investors and analysts. Buy The Dip, Says Mow Samson Mow, the CEO of Jan3 and a notable Bitcoin advocate, recently stirred the Bitcoin community with a post on his X account that included an optimistic forecast for Bitcoin’s price. Revisiting his earlier post, he added a highly optimistic prediction that Bitcoin could reach as high as $1 million per BTC. In his post, Mow used a visual diagram to compare the current available capital in the market with the amount of Bitcoin available and potentially mine-able in the future. The illustration did not specify quantities but effectively showed the small amount of Bitcoin available relative to the vast amount of capital that could potentially purchase it. The diagram, designed as overlapping triangles resembling an hourglass, emphasized the scarcity of Bitcoin in comparison to available capital. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Stubborn Stand Below $100K: What’s Holding It Back? Mow’s post highlighted his perspective on the ongoing price dip, suggesting that despite the drop, the fundamental outlook for Bitcoin remains strong due to its limited supply and growing adoption.

42408064,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga9DAf,1718133280,Funding Open-Source Generative AI With Crypto,"The intersection between generative artificial intelligence and Web3 is one of the most active areas of research and development in crypto circles over the last few months. Decentralized compute, zero-knowledge AI, smaller foundation models, decentralized data networks, and AI-first chains are some of the recent trends that aim to enable Web3-native rails for AI workloads.  These trends are technological innovations that seek to bridge the worlds of Web3 and AI, representing a natural friction against the centralized nature of generative AI. While creating technological bridges with AI is foundational for the evolution of Web3, they don’t represent the only integration path for these technology trends.  What if the path for integrating Web3 and AI was financial instead of purely technical? It turns out that the programmable finance and capital formation capabilities of crypto could be useful for one of the biggest challenges facing the current generative AI market.  What challenge are we referring to? Nothing other than the funding challenges of open-source generative AI.  Open Source Generative AI Needs to Succeed  Despite the recent level of innovation in decentralized generative AI, the gap with centralized AI tech is increasing rather than decreasing. Many people agree that blockchains represent the best technology alternative to the increasing centralized AI control of large tech platforms. However, the adoption challenges for decentralized AI platforms are monumental.  Decentralized compute is a clear pillar for decentralized AI but proves impractical for pretraining and fine-tuning workloads that require GPUs in close proximity with access to datasets that often sit behind corporate firewalls. Zero-knowledge ML is too expensive to be practical in large foundation models and hasn’t seen any real demand in the market. Decentralized data marketplaces need to overcome the same issues that have prevented data marketplaces from becoming large tech businesses.  While decentralized AI strives to overcome these frictions, centralized alternatives are accelerating at a frantic pace, creating a scary gap between the two. The one trend that is keeping the hopes for a world in which decentralized AI can succeed is the rapid evolution of open-source generative AI.  All decentralized AI trends rely on a healthy open-source generative AI ecosystem, yet that ecosystem might not be as healthy as it seems.  Open Source Generative AI Has a Massive Funding Problem  In the last couple of years, we have witnessed an explosion of innovation in open-source large generative AI as an alternative to platforms such as OpenAI/Microsoft, Google or Anthropic. Meta has become a surprising undisputed champion of open-source generative AI with the release of the Llama models. Companies like Mistral have raised billions in venture funding, enterprise platforms like Databricks or Snowflake are pushing open-source models, and there is a growing number of open-source generative AI releases on a weekly basis.  While the momentum in open-source generative AI is strong, a more detailed analysis shows a different reality. Open-source generative AI is facing a massive funding issue. When it comes to large foundation models, only large companies such as Databricks, Snowflake, Meta or well-funded startups like Mistral are keeping up with the performance of large closed models. Most of the releases from other labs, like Databricks and Snowflake, are focused on optimized enterprise workloads, while most of the recent open-source research is focusing on complementary techniques rather than on new models.  The reason behind this phenomenon can be attributed to the astronomical costs of building large frontier models. Any pre-training cycle for a 20 billion-plus parameter model could cost between ten to a hundred million dollars and involves a multi-month process with many failed attempts. These costs fall outside the budget of most university labs. To make matters more interesting, many of the grants for AI university labs come from large tech incumbents, which then are the immediate beneficiaries of the outputs.  Making money with open source has historically been hard, and making money with open-source generative AI is hard at AI scale. As a result, open-source generative AI is experiencing a massive funding crunch that can create a serious gap with the AI incumbents.  Crypto capital for open-source generative AI  The capital formation primitives of crypto seem like one of the few viable alternatives to address the funding crunch in generative AI. Throughout its history, crypto tokens have been a primary vehicle for capital formation for Web3 projects through bull and bear market cycles. Could some of these principles be applied to open-source generative AI? There is certainly more than one interesting option.  Gitcoin Quadratic Funding   Gitcoin represents one of the most successful examples of funding open-source innovation in Web3. The quadratic funding mechanism pioneered by Gitcoin could apply directly to generative AI. Bringing native generative AI capabilities to Web3 is paramount for the evolution of the space, so it is natural to expect that generative AI projects will drive community attention.  Let’s say that a university AI lab needs to raise $10 million for pre-training an LLM based on novel architecture. Multiple DAOs and foundations can contribute to a Gitcoin grant that can also be matched by the grantors, creating a more efficient funding mechanism. This mechanism is far more efficient than the current alternatives in the market.  A New Open-Source Generative AI License   Funding open-source projects enables mechanisms in which the value created by those projects can benefit the original funding community. When it comes to Web3 and open generative AI, an interesting idea is to establish a license in which any commercial application using a model funded using Web3 tokens should contribute part of that revenue back in the form of that specific token. This mechanism can even be enforced via smart contracts.  Addressing a Systemic Risk to Open Generative AI  Financing vehicles for open-source AI are one of the most important challenges to address in the current generative AI landscape. Open source is traditionally hard to finance, and open-source generative AI is even more so, considering the expensive computational requirements.  Not enabling proper funding channels to foster open-source innovation in generative AI can create a systemic risk to the entire space as the balance will shift entirely to closed commercial platforms. Crypto has established some of the most sophisticated and battle-tested channels for funding open-source innovation. Maybe, the first bridge between Web3 and generative AI will be financial and not necessarily technical.

Here’s the historical support level that the asset could visit next. Bitcoin Is Now Not Far From The Short-Term Holder Realized Price As analyst James Van Straten pointed out in a post on X, the Realized Price of the Bitcoin Short-Term Holders has been going up recently and currently sits around the $64,000 level. The “Realized Price” here refers to an on-chain metric that keeps track of the cost basis of the average investor in the BTC market. This indicator is based on the “Realized Cap” model for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Litecoin In Uphill Battle: Strong Resistance Might Block Recovery When the asset’s spot price is greater than the Realized Price, it means the investors are carrying some net unrealized profits right now. On the other hand, the coin’s value under the metric suggests the dominance of losses in the market. In the context of the current topic, the Realized Price of a specific sector segment is of interest: the Short-Term Holders (STHs). The STHs include all the investors who bought their coins within the past 155 days. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Realized Price of the Bitcoin STHs over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH Realized Price rapidly climbed during the rally towards the all-time high price (ATH) earlier in the year. This trend naturally makes sense, as the STHs represent the new investors in the market, who would have had to buy at higher prices as the asset climbed up, thus pushing the cohort’s average up. Since BTC’s consolidation phase following the March ATH, the indicator’s uptrend has slowed, but its value is increasing nonetheless. After the latest increase, the metric has approached $64,000. Now, what significance does the Realized Price of the STHs have? Historically, this indicator has taken turns acting as a major support and resistance line for the cryptocurrency. During bullish periods, this metric can facilitate bottom formations for the cryptocurrency, thus keeping it above itself, while bearish trends generally witness the line acting as a barrier preventing the coin from escaping above it. Transitions beyond this level have generally reflected a flip trend for the coin. This apparent pattern has held up likely because the STHs, being the relatively inexperienced hands, can be quite reactive. The cost basis is an important level for any investor, but this cohort, in particular, can be more likely to panic when a retest of their cost basis takes place. When the sentiment in the market is bullish, the STHs could decide to buy more when the price drops to their average cost basis, believing the drawdown to be merely a “dip” opportunity. In bearish phases, though, they may react to such a retest by panic selling instead. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could See Next Top At $89,200, Crypto Analyst Suggests The chart shows that Bitcoin found support around this line during the crash at the end of April/start of May, potentially implying a bullish sentiment has continued to be dominant.

Crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that this accumulation trend has created buying pressure that could be the much-needed catalyst for Ethereum to break above the $4,000 price mark. According to a social media post by Ali Martinez, the number of Ethereum addresses holding over 10,000 ETH tokens has increased by 3% in the last three weeks, showing a positive trend among large investors. Whales Accumulating Pushes Ethereum Buying Pressure Speculation over ETF approvals and increasing institutional buy-in have helped fuel Ethereum’s price increase earlier this year. The first price surge occurred in February when multiple reports came out of the SEC potentially approving Spot Ethereum ETF applications after the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Related Reading: Major Bitcoin Metric Breaks 3-Month Downtrend Amid Bullish Network Recovery This saw the price of Ethereum surging over 83% throughout the month to reach above $4,000 again for the first time since 2021. Similarly, court rulings in May, which increased the odds of Spot Ethereum ETF approval, pushed the price of ETH above $3,000 again. Now that the SEC has finally approved these spot ETF applications, institutional investors are taking the chance to load up their portfolios with Ethereum. According to Glassnode data, this accumulation, which has been going on for the past three weeks, has pushed the number of wallets holding over 10,000 ETH past 975 and steadily approaching 1,000 addresses. Furthermore, data shows that the number of ETH mega-whale addresses has steadily increased in the past 30 days, with the recent metric showing an addition of 15 whale addresses. The number of #Ethereum addresses holding 10,000+ $ETH has increased by 3% in the last three weeks, signaling an important spike in buying pressure! pic.twitter.com/7qq5HgGP37 — Ali (@ali_charts) June 9, 2024 On-chain data also reveals that social sentiment for ETH has stabilized after intense enthusiasm post-Spot Ethereum ETF approval. However, this hasn’t stopped the massive withdrawal from exchanges, leading Ethereum to become scarcer on centralized exchanges. This trend has now seen the Ethereum balance on centralized exchanges dropping below Bitcoin, even as Spot Bitcoin ETF wallets also accumulate Bitcoins. According to Glassnode data, less than 10.56% of Ethereum’s total supply is currently held on major exchanges. ETH Price Outlook: What’s Next After Critical Buying Pressure? With whales doubling down on Ethereum, the buying pressure has reached a critical point. This surge of interest signals a very bullish outlook for Ethereum’s price in the coming months, although there could be short-term volatility.

42408065,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga9D7M,1718126332,"Be Warned, AI Crypto Scams Are on the Rise","AI has arrived, and it’s already changing things in the world of crypto. Coders use it to code, researchers use it to research and, unfortunately, scammers use it to scam. That is the finding of a new report by blockchain analytics firm Elliptic about the emerging risks of AI in perpetuating criminal use of crypto.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.  “The rise of artificial intelligence has shown huge potential for driving innovation, not least within crypto. However, as with any emerging technology, there remains a risk of threat actors seeking to exploit new developments for illicit purposes,” the report reads.  While the risk right now remains small, the firm’s researchers did identify five “typologies” where AI is already being deployed in nefarious ways. These include in creating and disseminating deepfakes to make more convincing scams, building AI-scam tokens to capitalize on hype, using large language models to devise hacks, spreading disinformation and making more convincing phishing websites/prompts to facilitate identity theft.  Awareness of these new (or frankly, old, but now supercharged) scams means that users can stay ahead of the curve. That means crypto users should become more familiar with the most common types of crypto-related scams. CoinDesk has a good report on that front here covering all the basics like social media scams, Ponzi schemes, rug pulls and “romance scams” (now often referred to as “pig butchering”).  “The reason there is no easy way to deal with the problem is because it's really multiple problems, each with its own variables and solutions,” Pete Pachal, author of the excellent Media CoPilot Substack, wrote in a recent piece about deepfakes, AI and crypto.  According to Pachal, who recently spoke at a Consensus 2024 session called “From Taylor Swift to the 2024 Election: Deepfakes vs. Truth,” deepfakes have become increasingly difficult to spot as AI image generation has improved. For instance, earlier this month a video circulated on social media of fake Elon Musk promoting fake trading platform Quantum AI that promised users fake returns that apparently tricked more than a few people.  Instances like these are likely only going to grow. Verification company Sumsub claims that crypto was “the main target sector” for almost 90% of deepfake scams detected in 2023. While it’s unclear how effective these scams were, the FBI’s online crime report found crypto investment losses in the U.S. grew 53% to $3.9 billion last year.  See also: This Is How Scammers Can Drain Your Crypto Wallet  However, it’s worth noting that oftentimes instances of fraud in the crypto industry are just incidentally related to crypto, because it just happens to be a topic that draws a lot of attention and is often complicated for people not steeped in the culture.  As CFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger told CoinDesk: “I think it's a little unfair because a lot of these cases are just run of the mill fraud; somebody stealing someone else's money, someone claiming to buy crypto, but not actually buying the crypto. So we've seen this play out with whatever the hot topic is at the time.”  If there’s any consolation, it’s that images, video and text generated by AI are still relatively easy to notice if you know what to look for. Crypto users in particular should be vigilant, considering how common it is for even high-profile figures to get tricked by social engineering schemes or malicious scripts.  MetaMask builder Taylor Monahan has sage advice here: always know you’re a potential target, and actually verify what you’re clicking on is what it purports to be.  Crypto is already a low-trust environment, just given the nature of the technology. And it might get even lower.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | RESEARCH,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/06/11/be-warned-ai-crypto-scams-are-on-the-rise,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bc8cf657e6f7825ac3dbdae65036935fd4f8de2f-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin {{BTC}} started the day trading near $70,000 before hitting a three-week low price at $66,170 during the U.S. session. It slightly rebounded to near $66,500, but was still down nearly 5% over the past 24 hours.  Altcoins saw even deeper pullbacks during the same period, with the broad-market crypto market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index declining over 6% with all twenty constituents being in the red. Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} broke below $3,500 and was down 6.5%, while solana {{SOL}}, dogecoin {{DOGE}}, Cardano's ADA and Chainlink's LINK endured 6%-9% losses.  The sudden pullback incurred over $250 million in liquidations of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets, CoinGlass data shows, marking the second significant leverage flush in a week after Friday's $400 million liquidations.  Liquidations occur when an exchange closes a leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial money down, or ""margin,"" because the user fails to meet the margin requirements or doesn't have enough funds to keep the position open.  One reason behind the pullback is investors “de-risking” from crypto assets ahead of tomorrow's May Consumer Price Index (CPI) report and Fed meeting, hedge fund QCP said in an update.  Bitcoin could see a volatile session Wednesday as it has been ""highly responsive"" to economic data recently and its 30-day correlation with U.S. equities climbing to highest since 2022, K33 Research noted in a Tuesday market update.  ""The stage is set for a frantic macro-Wednesday, with both May CPI data and the FEDs interest rate decision poised to move the market,"" K33 analysts said.  Investors will monitor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members' interest rate outlook – so-called ""dot plot"" – to see how many rate cuts policymakers are projecting for this year in light of recent sticky inflation readings and softer economic data.  ""The FOMC dot plot, alongside forward guidance during Jerome Powell’s press conference, is likely to be the most material price movers, as BTC has resumed its attentiveness to the market's interest rate expectations.""  Market observers noted some positive signs during the sell-off that could point to a quick recovery.  Bitcoin saw multiple pullbacks this year before FOMC meetings only to reverse the move soon after, pseudonymous crypto analyst Gumshoe pointed out in an X post.  Bitcoin futures open interest on crypto exchanges BitMEX and Binance deviated earlier today, crypto analytics platform CryptoQuant posted citing pseudonymous trader BQYoutube. ""Often this kind of phenomenon is seen when whales [on] BitMEX start to accumulate positions while Binance retail gets washed out,” the post added.

42408075,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga9Dl2,1718124592,Will Trump Trounce Biden? Polymarket Traders Are Betting on It.,"This week in prediction markets  Do prediction markets have a pro-Trump bias? Or do they just put a premium on the front-runners?  Trump and Biden will likely debate, while Trump won't be charged with another felony, Polymarket prices signal.  Kalshi bettors place Coinbase volume above last quarter's.   If traders on Polymarket are right, and there's $165 million bet on the question, the 2024 U.S. presidential election will be a blowout for the ages.  With a 56% chance of winning, former president Donald Trump has a 22-percentage-point lead over incumbent Joe Biden, according to the crypto-based platform's officially non-American bettors (as part of a settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Polymarket agreed to geo-block U.S.-based users). Contrast that to an aggregate of polls prepared by Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight, which gives Trump a mere one-point lead.  Some might be quick to attribute the huge gap to the fact that Polymarket users are, by definition, crypto users, and therefore might be biased toward him. They might note that on PredictIt, a more traditional prediction market platform settled in U.S. dollars, Trump is leading 50-45: Still a wider margin than the polls, but nowhere near as dramatic as only Polymarket.  Trump, after all, is the pro-crypto candidate. There's also the crypto community's love of a troll: Trump-themed ""PoliFi"" tokens have a higher market cap than their Biden counterparts.  On the other hand, these traders are betting on what will happen, not what they want to happen. So they are highly incentivized to research and make informed decisions, regardless of their political preferences. In theory, at least, these markets should be a more reliable gauge of sentiment than polling, and perhaps a superior forecasting method as well.  Indeed, Ryan Selkis, founder of crypto research outfit Messari, claimed in a recent tweet that the Trump campaign has been giving their candidate Polymarket numbers on top of the usual polling readout, because the team is heavily skeptical of polls in general.  Remember: in prediction markets, those who bet on the correct outcome receive $1 per share, while those who bet wrong get nothing, with share prices reflecting probabilities. A share trading at 40 cents indicates a 40% chance of success, for example.  Another, more banal explanation of Trump's outsized odds on Polymarket is that traders there tend to put a high premium on any leading candidate, way ahead of the polls.  Look at other recent elections where there was a gulf between Polymarket and the polls.  Ahead of Taiwan's Jan. 13 election, Polymarket gave the Democratic Progressive Party's Lai Ching-te a 60% to 70% chance of winning, even though his polling numbers were only in the high 20s to low 40s. Lai won with 40% of the vote.  In the run-up to Indonesia's election in February, Polymarket put Prabowo Subianto's chances of winning in the high 70s, while his polling numbers were in the high 50s. He won with 55%.  There are a lot of other factors at play in Trump's high odds on Polymarket. Traders are heavily discounting independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. at around 2% probably, while 538's poll aggregation has him closer to 9%. Similarly, in Taiwan's, the presence of a third-party potential spoiler in the form of the newly established People's Party, led by Taipei's former mayor Ko Wen-je, added some complexity to the model as Polymarket gave the TPP lower probability than its polling numbers.  So is the Polymarket premium a predictive force or an online flex for Trump fans? We'll have much better data to answer that question after the November ballot result.  Debate Is Likely; Another Conviction Isn't  Trump, ever the showman, is said to be thrilled about taking the stage against Biden for the first Presidential election debate scheduled for later this month. So thrilled that his campaign is calling for more: four debates as opposed to the two proposed by the Biden camp.  There's a growing narrative, however, that Trump will ghost the debates entirely if he doesn't get his way about formats and other specifics.  In an interview in late May, Democratic strategist James Carville suggested that Trump won't show up to the debates if he doesn't think doing so is in his own self-interest.  ""I don’t think Trump will go to the debate,"" Carville said in an interview with neoconservaitve commentator Bill Kristol. ""He doesn’t do anything that’s not in his perceived self-interest, and this is one of these things where he could hurt — Biden has a chance to help himself.""  The market seems to be dismissing Carville's prediction, giving the debate a 77% chance of going on as scheduled.  Meanwhile, news that Trump's other felony trials are stuck in bureaucratic limbo means that the market is only pricing in a 14% chance that he'll appear before a court – and be convicted again – prior to the election in November.  Are Retail Traders Reaping Crypto's Riches?  Coinbase is set to report quarterly earnings on June 14, and a closely watched metric will be the crypto exchange's trading volume, a measure of retail investors' market participation.  Coinbase, of course, isn't all retail. It has a large institutional business, but the licensed exchange with reliable banking on- and off-ramps is a bellwether for retail trading. Its mobile app's position in Apple's top 100 free app section has been a popular indicator of retail's participation in the crypto market.  Over at Kalshi, the lone U.S.-regulated prediction market platform, a contract asking bettors to forecast Coinbase's trading volume has it coming in at $174 billion, higher than the $154 billion Coinbase posted at the end of its last quarter in February.  With the wreckage of FTX cleaned up, a big narrative trend has been the institutionalization of crypto.  There's a lot to be said as to why this is a positive development for crypto, as endorsements by the world's largest fund managers, such as BlackRock and Fidelity, in the form of exchange traded fund (ETF) products are an indicator that the asset class isn't a fly-by-night operation ready to rug pull investors.  At the same time, it can be argued that a heavily institutionalized asset class is antithetical to the vision of Satoshi Nalamoto, who wrote the bitcoin white paper in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis when these same institutions torpedoed the global economy.  In the time since Coinbase's last earnings report, bitcoin is up around 45%, according to CoinDesk Indices data. Kalshi bettors are plotting just a 13% increase in Coinbase's trading volume for the same period.

29318569,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=624051,1718123408,Is Bitcoin Crashing Because Of Miner Capitulation And Speculative BTC Bets?,"Bitcoin is dumping when writing, cooling off from May highs of nearly $72,000. Down roughly 10% from all-time highs, there could be more losses on the way, at least looking at the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart. Now, Willy Woo, a Bitcoin on-chain analyst, thinks the drop is primarily because of the ongoing “miner capitulation.” Woo notes that the network is now actively “culling” out weak miners, forcing them to shut down their operations. Related Reading: Blood In The Water? Ethereum Whales Circle As Price Drops As they exit, they sell their BTC holdings, running into thousands, if not tens of thousands, of the coin. Bitcoin Network “Culling” Weak Miners Because of market dynamics, the higher the supply, the lower the prices; Bitcoin is flushing lower, squeezing out even more miners. It remains to be seen for how long this will continue, but the impact of Halving is now increasingly evident. In Woo’s assessment, miner capitulation is necessary. Moreover, weak miners’ forced liquidation of BTC will only make the network more resilient. This is because the “cull” will eliminate less efficient players from the network, ultimately leading to a more robust system. On April 20, the Bitcoin network Halved miner rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Since miners depend on rewards as their primary income source, their revenue was slashed by 50%. If they choose to continue operating, they must not only compete with larger mining firms, most of which are public, like Riot Blockchain and Mara Digital, but they must also be very efficient, using modern gear for a higher hash rate. Staying efficient is a primary challenge, and rather than competing with public miners, some, as it appears, are folding and choosing to exit the business. Interestingly, even as “weak” miners shut down operations, the network hash rate–a measure of the total computing power–is still at near record highs. According to YCharts, the hash rate is 578 EH/s, down from 721 EH/s registered on April 23. Will BTC Prices Recover If Speculative Bets Are Purged? Woo also thinks there is a need to “purge the degen open interest in futures bets.” The analyst says excessive leverage trading on perpetual platforms like Binance, OKX, and Bybit must drop. The spike in degen trading has driven up the “paper Bitcoin,” or speculative bets. Woo explains that following the collapse of FTX in November 2022, speculative bets were wiped, allowing for a swift recovery in BTC prices in the following months. Related Reading: $2 Billion Crypto Funds Flow Into Market On Rate Cut Buzz If the coin is to recover and reject the current attempts for lower lows, the clearance of the current “paper Bitcoin” overhang will be required for a sustained leg up. Whether the “cleansing” of weak miners and speculative bets will help drive up prices remains to be seen for now. Bitcoin is trickling lower, confirming the losses of June 6. The immediate support lies at $66,000. If this level is lost, BTC could flash crash to $60,000 or even May 2024 lows of $56,500.

In a separate report, France's Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) said crypto remains a high risk for money laundering.  Privacy coins, mixers and layer-2 platforms can make it difficult for law-enforcement agencies to trace funds, according to a report from the European Union's Innovation Hub for Internal Security, a network of labs supporting internal security organizations in the 27-nation bloc.  The report, published Monday by crime-fighting agencies including Europol and Eurojust with the European Commission and others, told law enforcement agencies they need to be prepared to encounter those types of tools in their investigations.  Crypto mixers have recently been in the spotlight. Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev was sentenced to spend more than five years in jail by a Dutch court after prosecutors successfully argued the platform was created for money laundering. Tornado Cash allows crypto users to exchange tokens while hiding wallet addresses on the Ethereum, BNB Chain, Arbitrum, Avalanche and Optimism networks.  ""Mixer Tornado.cash has also been using zero-knowledge proofs to enable users to withdraw funds from the mixer without revealing what their original deposit was,"" the report said. ""This significantly complicates tracing the origins of (illicit) cryptocurrency for law enforcement.""  Privacy coins like Monero build privacy into their protocols, hiding the identities of the sender, the receiver and even the money being sent.  ""Layer 2 solutions such as the Lightning Network might also be abused by criminals,"" the report said. ""This can be used, for example, to make payments to each other without making times and amounts of these payments visible. Similarly, new wallet encryption schemes may also complicate lawful access by law enforcement.""

42408070,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga9DNt,1718120465,TipLink Aims for Crypto Newcomers With Google-Powered Solana Wallet,"Solana {{SOL}} crypto wallet startup TipLink is making a play for newcomer blockchain users with a service that cuts wallet browser extensions out of the equation.  Called TipLink Wallet Adaptor, it creates an in-browser wallet linked to a person's Google account, sidestepping the usual requirement that one set up a less-user-friendly Phantom, Solflare or other wallet before receiving any tokens.  ""It unlocks the rest of the world for easy onboarding,"" said CEO Ian Krotinsky.  TipLink's builders are betting the workaround will have stronger appeal to the vast majority of internet users who don't have a crypto wallet, nor the knowledge or desire to set one up. Instead, they can receive a link to a wallet, login with the popular credential and go.  That might irk the most committed of self-custody proponents, the ones for whom ""not your keys, not your coins,"" rings loudest. But Krotinsky isn't worried about catering to that crowd. The app buries its private keys beyond easy reach to limit the possibility of users accidentally handing them to a would-be phisher, he said. Google's security protocols go a long way, especially for users who have two-factor authentication.  ""It's currently not the place users will likely store a million dollars in,"" Krotinsky said, adding that the team is working to add ""more layers of security"" over time.  For example, TipLink works in something of a walled garden for dapps. It will only interact with programs that have been vetted to ensure they are not malicious or won't steal user funds, according to a promotional video shared with CoinDesk.

29315124,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=615251,1718118006,"Bitcoin Price Crashes Below $67,000: Key Reasons","The Bitcoin price has fallen by 4.7% since peaking at $71,231 yesterday, now hovering around $66,967. This decline marks a notable return of volatility in the market, driven by several critical factors. #1 Federal Reserve’s FOMC Meeting Anticipation The Bitcoin market seems to be in a risk-off mode ahead of tomorrow’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Wednesday, June 12th. The market’s sensitivity to macroeconomic indicators is on full display as stakeholders await the US Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates and its economic projections. Current expectations suggest that the Fed will maintain the interest rates at a range of 5.25%-5.50%, but the market is bracing for the updated dot plot which is projected to adopt a more hawkish stance. The adjustment anticipated involves reducing the expected rate cuts in 2024 from three to two, with some speculating about the possibility of only one cut. This hawkish tilt in monetary policy projections is poised to influence investor behavior significantly, as higher interest rates typically dampen the appeal of non-yielding assets like cryptocurrencies. Adding to the uncertainty, the May 2024 US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data is scheduled for release just hours before the FOMC’s announcement. The market has reacted strongly to US macroeconomic data in recent months, and any deviation from expectations could lead to substantial price fluctuations. Related Reading: FOMC Preview: How Will Bitcoin And Crypto React? All You Need To Know Crypto analyst Ted commented on X, noting the critical nature of this week’s events: “After last Friday’s strong employment data, markets have almost completely priced out a July rate cut. Powell could quickly change this on Wednesday, especially if CPI comes in soft. There’s an (off) chance for significant repricing this week, which could move BTC + crypto…” #2 Intensified Spot Selling Pressure The immediate catalyst for the recent price drop appears to be a surge in spot selling. Analysis from alpha dōjō reveals that heavy selling pressure was largely responsible for the slide down to a low of $67,000. The market dynamics observed during this period indicate a clear shift, with an increased volume of sell orders not met by sufficient buy orders to sustain the price level. This imbalance has led to a breach in what was previously considered a robust support zone around $68,000. Related Reading: Hedge Funds Heavily Betting For Bitcoin To Fall: Will This Strategy Fail? The analysts elaborated on the situation, “Volatility has made a comeback, with BTC dropping as much as 3.5% to a low of $67k since yesterday. This selloff was primarily driven by heavy spot selling pressure, which is quite negative. A major concern is the lack of liquidations while the selloff is happening. BTC is currently in a critical area; the daily structure has been broken. BTC needs to bounce here, or it’s very likely we’ll fall back to the lower $60ks.” #3 Inflow Streak In Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Ends The investment dynamics within spot Bitcoin ETFs have also reflected the market’s bearish turn. After 19 consecutive days of positive inflows, these funds experienced significant outflows totaling $64.9 million yesterday. Notable among these was the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which saw outflows of $39.5 million. In contrast, BlackRock registered smaller inflows of $6.3 million. The performance of other ETF providers showed considerable variation. Fidelity recorded outflows amounting to $3 million, while Bitwise registered inflows of $7.6 million. In contrast, Invesco experienced outflows of $20.5 million, and Valkyrie also reported outflows totaling $15.8 million. At press time, BTC traded at $66,967.

The company's financial performance is heavily influenced by the volatility of Bitcoin's price, but it is succeeding in building a more stable business based on subscriptions. The stock is currently trading at a 40% premium, suggesting limited upside potential. It is recommended to hold off on buying at this price. My thesis Everyone speaks about artificial intelligence ((AI)), and it seems that all other big secular shifts are undeservedly ignored. The crypto revolution is one of such trends and Coinbase ( COIN ) is one of the most important companies within the shift. There are several reasons to believe that COIN is one of the companies with strong potential to grow. The company is one of pioneers in the crypto industry and is the undisputed leading platform to trade crypto assets. The footprint in the U.S. is already massive. Having a strong positioning in a very competitive market gives optimism about COIN's potential to successfully expand internationally. Unfortunately, according to my intrinsic value calculation, the stock trades with a 40% premium. This means that big optimism is already priced in, and further upside is quite unlikely from this share price. On the other hand, the company's financial performance significantly depends on swings in the Bitcoin price. Bitcoin's price movements are quite unpredictable, which means that my intrinsic value calculation is based on assumptions with an extreme level of uncertainty around them. To conclude, I think that there will be better opportunities to initiate position in COIN and it is a Hold at the moment. COIN stock analysis Coinbase Global is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S. and one of the largest in the world. Apart from transaction revenue, COIN also generates sales from subscription and services revenue. 10-K Transaction revenue has been extremely volatile over the last three years, and it was multiple times lower in 2023 compared to 2021. This is explained by the nature of cryptocurrencies. Due to their inherent volatility, cryptocurrencies are mostly speculative assets. That said, when the Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) price fell sharply in 2022, it has led to significant shrinkage in the trading volume, which has not recovered yet. The big crypto selloff in 2022 also affected sentiment in 2023, which also adversely impacted the trading volume. 10-K Profitability also significantly depends on the trading volume. However, the management did well in fortifying the company's business mix in recent years. Subscription and Services revenue almost tripled between 2021 and 2023 even despite considering the aftermath of the selloff happened in 2022. Boosting subscription revenue is a solid catalyst because this revenue is likely less vulnerable to sharp swifts in BTC and other coins' prices. Subscription revenue has several sub-streams in it, outlined below in more detail. 10-K As a result of the BTC-USD price recovery in 2023 and rapid expansion of COIN's subscription revenue, the stock rallied massively over the last twelve months. However, it is still cheaper compared to 2021 highs. In the below chart it is clearly seen that COIN has an almost perfect correlation with the price of Bitcoin. Data by YCharts Price of cryptocurrencies are driven by the supply-demand equilibrium. As the world's largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin sets the tone for all other coins. Therefore, let us look at how the Bitcoin's supply-demand equilibrium might look like in future. Let me start with the supply side. According to nerdwallet.com , Bitcoin has released about 19.6 million of the 21 million total coins its source code will ever make available. That means that around 93% of the total supply capacity is already reached. However, due to the halving phenomenon, the maximum supply of 21 million will be reached only around the year 2140. Therefore, Bitcoin's supply is very unlikely to change significantly in foreseeable future and the demand will be the major driver of the BTC-USD price. Since BTC is mostly a speculative asset, the demand for it depends on the risk appetite of crypto traders. The cheaper money is (that is, the lower interest rates are), usually the higher the risk trades are willing to take. That is, since the Fed is expected to start cutting rates this year, the demand from crypto trading will likely grow. To support this statement, from the below chart it is evident that BTC started rallying massively in 2023 once the Fed stopped increasing interest rates. Data by YCharts From a more fundamental, not speculative, perspective it is important to pay attention to the penetration of crypto assets in our everyday lives. According to Statista, crypto user penetration is expected to grow steadily from 10.8% in 2024 to 12.4% in 2028. This might seem slow, but from headlines we see that BTC adoption expands notably. Some countries, as El Salvador, already adopted BTC as an official currency . Starting from December 2023, Swiss city Lugano accepts Bitcoin for all city invoices. In April 2024 , one of the largest digital payments processing companies in the world, Stripe, announced that it is bringing back crypto as a way to accept payments. That said, the limited BTC supply and growing demand for cryptocurrencies will likely lead to growing Bitcoin price, which will bring more trading volume to the Coinbase platform. Moreover, as crypto penetrates deeper into everyday transactions, the more sustainable growth in demand for crypto assets will be likely achieved. Coinbase will likely benefit from this favorable secular trend because the company's position in the U.S. crypto industry is unparalleled. It commands a 76% market share in the crypto exchanges market, meaning that it dominates the industry. The competition might come from Chinese players like Binance, but I think that probability is low. Binance has a controversial reputation in the U.S. as it was investigated by SEC , and its CEO and founder was even sentenced to four months in California prison on money-laundering violations. Intrinsic value calculation Discounted cash flow ((DCF)) approach rarely lets me down. Apart from it, the DCF appears to be the only reliable approach as the company is unlikely to start paying dividends anytime soon, which makes valuation under dividend-related models impossible. Moreover, running a peer valuation ratios analysis also does not look reliable because there is no other public U.S. company like Coinbase. Therefore, the DCF is likely the only way out to determine COIN's intrinsic value. I must start with calculating COIN's weighted average cost of capital, or WACC. According to my working below, COIN's WACC is 16.9%. It is so high due to COIN's massive 2.73 beta. DT Invest With WACC figured out, I can proceed with selecting other assumptions. For the current fiscal year, estimates from Wall Street analysts is a reliable source, in my opinion. Thus, I expect a $5.63 billion revenue in Year 1. As we saw in previous years, the volume of crypto trading significantly depends on the stance of investors, which is directly affected by the Fed's monetary policy. Since the Fed is expected to cut rates twice this year, it is highly likely that interest rates can move much lower in 2025. The last time interest rates were low, in FY 2021, COIN generated $7.4 billion in revenue. Therefore, I expect this revenue level for the second year of my DCF model. It is extremely difficult to forecast for years beyond the next two years. Therefore, I will rely on industry CAGR long-term forecasts for Years 3-5. Statista forecasts an industry CAGR of 8.62%, and it looks safe to incorporate into the DCF model. From the profitability perspective, I use a TTM levered FCF margin for the year 1, which is 5.31% . For the years 2-5 I use FY 2021 level, which is 33.83%. Due to COIN's strong potential to become one of the most important crypto companies in the world, I use an ambitious 5% perpetual growth rate. DT Invest Unfortunately, COIN is substantially overvalued at the moment. I think that a 40% premium to the stock price is not deserved, even for a potential star like COIN. Therefore, I would not recommend buying at this price. What can go wrong with my thesis? Cryptocurrencies overall, and Bitcoin particularly, are highly unpredictable. It is impossible to calculate the intrinsic value of BTC, which makes it impossible to project a target price for it. Sometimes it goes against all forecasts. For example, as the Fed remained hawkish in 2023, it was reasonable to forecast BTC softness. Despite this factor, it rose by 155% in 2023 . Therefore, it means that my DCF model incorporates assumptions with a low level of confidence in them. If BTC delivers another 100% rally over the next few months, COIN's revenue can potentially move higher than FY2021 levels. Or, vice versa, it might suddenly drop by 73% like it did in 2018 when the monetary policy was not tight. Therefore, a 40% potential downside might be wrong and investors who will decide not to buy based on my analysis will potentially miss out on a solid rally. Summary There are several reasons to believe that Coinbase has a strong potential to become one of the most important companies in the crypto era. However, this optimism is already priced in, and a 40% premium suggests that the market expects exponential revenue growth and profitability expansion. I need a few more quarters to get more conviction, and I am giving COIN a Hold rating here.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4698605-coinbase-strong-potential-but-valuation-is-too-hot-coin-stock?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/29314276.jpeg

The program went live Tuesday with 35 million tokens, worth $23 million at current prices, eligible for distribution. The network is in the process of transitioning its current token, MATIC, to the new POL ticker, so this first tranche of tokens will be denominated in MATIC.  The program will tap into funds made available by Polygon’s Community Treasury, and the team shared that roughly 100 million POL tokens will be given out each year.  Those looking to participate in the program can opt into two tracks. The first is what the team calls a “General Grant Track,” which is for builders looking to build anything on Polygon. The second is the “Consumer Crypto Track,” which focuses on projects that drive crypto adoption, including gaming, decentralized social applications, AI and blockchain integrations, and NFT innovations.  “The grant program follows proposals to ensure that Polygon becomes a strong, community-governed aggregated network of chains,” Polygon wrote in a blog post.

42408066,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga9DDy,1718113973,"Lido Introduces 'Restaking Vaults' in Collaboration with Symbiotic, Mellow Finance","Lido, the Ethereum staking stalwart, has recently been grappling with the frenzy around ""restaking,"" a new trend that threatens to erode the staking platform's grip on decentralized finance (DeFi).  Lido is controlled by the Lido DAO, a consortium of LDO token-holders who vote on protocol strategy and key upgrades.  A new initiative from the DAO will see Lido's partnering with Mellow Finance, a platform that lets users generate yield by depositing into restaking ""vaults,"" and Symbiotic, a permissionless restaking protocol. Under the new initiative, traders will gain access to restaking tools that could help return Lido stETH to center stage.  ""The strategy for Lido is to demonstrate to the market that using stETH as the restaking asset of choice is actually the superior way of doing restaking,"" adcv, the pseudonymous co-founder of Steakhouse Financial and the Lido DAO's finance workstream said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Lido sits at the center of Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem, allowing users to stake cryptocurrency—parking it with the chain to help protect it—in return for rewards. Lido's big innovation when it launched a couple of years ago was that it gave depositors a ""liquid staking token"" called Lido staked ETH (stETH) that users could trade even as their underlying deposits were technically locked up on Ethereum.  Lido currently ranks as the largest decentralized finance protocol on Ethereum, with $33 billion worth of deposits, according to DefiLlama. StETH, meanwhile, has grown to become one of the most popular assets in DeFi.  But lately, Lido's dominance has fallen as users have moved assets over to EigenLayer, a newer service that allows users to ""restake"" assets like ether (ETH) and stETH to help secure other networks in exchange for additional rewards.  Read more: Restaking 101: What Are Restaking, Liquid Restaking and EigenLayer?  Lido recently introduced The Lido Alliance—a group of partners and protocols committed to protecting stETH's role in Ethereum DeFi. Lido's head of strategy, Hasu, has also outlined reGOOSE, a multi-pronged strategy to help Lido to address the risks posed to it by restaking.  This new initiative—the launch of four stETH-centric restaking products on Mellow Finance—is the first example of reGOOSE and The Lido Alliance in action. It's also the first hint of how Symbiotic, a startup backed by Lido's co-founders and largest investor, could play a key role in Lido's future plans.  Lido backs Mellow Finance  Lido DAO is throwing its formal endorsement behind Mellow Finance, a DeFi protocol that offers liquid restaking ""vaults."" Users can deposit assets like stETH into the vaults, and ""curators""—which are like crypto underwriters—will deploy those assets across different actively validated services, or AVSs (protocols that are secured by restaked assets), to help users earn extra interest on their funds.  Mellow's new platform is an answer to liquid restaking protocols like Renzo and Ether.Fi, which restake user deposits into EigenLayer (and, soon, other restaking protocols) to help investors earn extra interest.  Like everything else DeFi, liquid restaking exists as a way for people to wring out as much ""economic efficiency"" (read: yield) as they can from their digital assets. Protocol users earn receipts on their deposits called ""liquid restaking tokens,"" or LRTs, that can be traded, lent and borrowed on other protocols in exchange for additional rewards.  In liquid restaking, ""you have players like Renzo and EtherFi that do it top to bottom, but Mellow brings a permissionless quality to it, which we found quite appealing,"" said adcv.  Whereas traditional liquid restaking protocols take a one-size-fits-all approach to select where they deploy user capital, Mellow lets anyone set up a vault and distribute deposits according to their own risk parameters and investment theses.  ""Vaults are an important step in realizing the reGOOSE strategy, offering stakers the power to navigate the varied terrain of the risk/reward landscape,"" Lido DAO said in a statement shared with CoinDesk.  Mellow curators Steakhouse, P2P Validator, Re7 Labs and MEV Capital are each introducing vaults that accept stETH in tandem with Tuesday's announcement.  For now, the rewards that users receive for depositing into Mellow's vaults will come in the form of loosely-defined ""points"" that may eventually be tied to future token airdrops. (There are currently no AVSs rewarding interest on Symbiotic or any other restaking protocol.)  Read more: As Crypto 'Points' Farming Grows, So Does Risk of Vague Promises  For the time being, the vaults are best viewed as proof of concept for why stETH is a useful asset for restaking. ""StETH is the best possible asset to use as restaking collateral,"" insists adcv. ""It has all of the network effects. It has all of the liquidity, and it has the ability to abstract away the native staking [...] It earns the native staking yield at all times.""  ""I personally expect and hope that other LRTs—Renzo, EtherFi, whoever—to recognize that as well and adopt it in turn as their primary collateral,"" said acdv.  Enter, Symbiotic  It's no coincidence that Mellow Finance is building its restaking vaults using Symbiotic, an up-and-coming competitor to EigenLayer.  Last month, a CoinDesk report first revealed that Symbiotic was quietly being funded by Paradigm, Lido's biggest backer, and cyber•fund, a venture firm led by Lido's co-founders. The report also showed internal company documents detailing how the yet-to-launch Symbiotic protocol might work for the first time.  On a purely technical level, it makes sense that Mellow would choose Symbiotic to build its permissionless vaults: EigenLayer only accepts certain crypto assets (namely, ETH, EIGEN, and certain ETH derivatives), whereas Symbiotic accepts any kind of crypto asset based on Ethereum's ERC-20 token standard.  But there's another reason—beyond Symbiotic's investors or technical details—why Lido DAO might choose to partner with a restaking platform other than EigenLayer. Although EigenLayer accepts deposits of Lido's stETH—meaning it's possible to use Lido and EigenLayer at the same time—it has placed caps on how much stETH one can deposit.  EigenLayer's growth has therefore come at the expense of Lido's, since some users have withdrawn their stake from Lido to funnel more assets into the newer restaking platform.  ""EigenLayer was effectively, on a discretionary basis, limiting the amount of steETH that could go into their middleware—rather arbitrarily, in my view,"" said adcv. ""I expect that this type of restriction will become more and more rare in the future, because from the perspective of a restaking provider, you don't want to put any sort of breaks on your ability to raise capital.""  EigenLayer has ""had it very easy until now, but with more competition, it will become more difficult to be so selective,"" he said.  CORRECTION (June 11, 2024 14:12 UTC): Lido deposits number $33 billion, not $27 billion.

29311819,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=615413,1718112652,"Bitcoin Crash Below $67,000 Sends Market Spiraling, Here Are The Levels To Watch","The new week has been quite bearish for bitcoin, with the price witnessing major crashes below multiple support levels. After losing its footing above $71,000, it has plunged further below $67,000, signaling the start of a downtrend. Amid the uncertainty, a crypto analyst has presented the important levels to watch as Bitcoin makes it descent, showing a possible direction for the price. Bitcoin Enters Sideways Consolidation In an analysis on the TradingView platform, crypto analyst Bitcoin Signals revealed some important developments for the Bitcoin price. The first observation is the fact that the coin has entered a consolidation zone on the 4-hour chart. This consolidation is currently taking place between $67,000 and $72,000, an area that the price is currently skirting around. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Rally 50,000% To $250, Here’s When As a result of this development, the crypto analyst believes that short-term correction is forming for the cryptocurrency. This is behind the drop in price, and since then, the BTC price has broken down below important support levels such as $69,200, and on Tuesday morning, bears were able to pull the price below $67,000 after breaking below the support zone of $67,200 identified by Bitcoin Signals in the analysis. The crypto analyst further pointed out that the price could continue to move inside this range, which is where the correction is forming. However, there has been a falling wedge pattern that has been forming through the breakdown. According to the analyst, this could see the Bitcoin price break out of the $69,200 resistance once again and make another run for $72,000. Based on the analysis, the crypto analyst believe that the price could continue to correct downward unless it’s able to break resistance at $72,000. Bitcoin Signals based this on the “current market structure and price behavior following a clear breakout on the long-term chart,” suggesting a continuation of the decline. BTC Price On The Charts Selling pressure is currently dominating the Bitcoin price, as evidenced by the direction of the cryptocurrency while seeing an uptick in major metrics. For example, CoinMarketCap data shows that the daily trading volume of BTC is up 89.85% in the last day. However, with the price going down, it suggests that this increase in volume is being caused by sellers rather than buyers.

42408078,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga9Dux,1718112305,What Do the EU Election Results Mean for Digital Assets?,"Europe just elected 702 members of the European Parliament. Some would call the vote a grand exercise of democracy. Others would call it a repurposed opinion poll for domestic politics. The results show that it is a bit of both.  Broadly, Sunday’s outcomes were forecasted. The snap elections in France were not.  The main takeaway is that decisions in the European Parliament will continue to be made by a centrist majority. Together, the center-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D), the center-right European People’s Party (EPP), and the liberal Renew will hold more than 410 votes. This is enough majority for both policymaking and to re-elect the current President of the European Commission.  The press is reporting a shift to the right. This is technically accurate. The far-right secured big victories in the heart of Europe, including in Germany, France and Italy. Mainly the Nordics and Portugal bucked the trend and gave fewer votes to the eurosceptics than forecasted.  This signals a disturbance in our societies, but to say that the far-right will now decide EU policy is an exaggeration. The biggest EU political group, the EPP, has deep ideological divergences from the parties sitting further on the right. Therefore, it is much more likely to formally partner in the above-mentioned centrist coalition. This has been the vehicle for Parliament decision-making to this date, and it will remain so.  The power of the further-right (ECR – the European Conservatives and Reformists) and the far-far-right (ID – Identity and Democracy) should not be overstated, but it should not be ignored either.  ECR, in particular, gained 15 seats last evening. 14 of those came from the party of the Italian Prime Minister, Georgia Meloni. She has been a much milder conservative than her election campaign might have suggested, recognizing the degree of cooperation needed with both Brussels and Washington DC in order to consolidate her power. Even so, formally working with the ECR might be a taboo for the mainstream parties. But collaboration on specific policy issues is now possible for the EPP, even if only used as a threat and a negotiation technique in disagreements with the center-left.  That includes issues like crypto-assets. In the negotiations over MiCA and the AML package, it was common to see left and right MEPs disagree on how prescriptive and restrictive the rules should be. Weeks of negotiations were spent in stand-offs around the EU Travel Rule or around the sustainability of bitcoin.  Several caveats before we color the new right-wing formation as positive for the industry.  Firstly, individual MEPs have made an outsized difference to EU crypto policy. Their influence combines an ability to operate within the ideology of their group, within the responsibilities given to their committee, and a high degree of understanding of the industry. This tri-factor is hard to come by, and the industry will be fortunate to see some of these progressive voices return to Brussels.  Secondly, ECR as a whole and PM Meloni’s party, specifically, have not really had a consistent view on digital assets. Within the EPP, too, the power dynamic is shifting between representatives from Poland, Spain and Germany. These are known unknowns.  Lastly, the influence of the Parliament, as an institution, should be considered in the context of where we are in the legislative cycle. The next legislative mandate, from 2024 to 2029, will not have a MiCA moment of the same magnitude. Authorities in charge of implementation at the EU and national levels will be doing the bulk of the work for the next two years.  In that sense, President Macron calling snap elections in France on Sunday could be important for the digital assets industry. Meanwhile, the European Commission has to form a view on what, if any, new policy initiatives still need to be taken in the areas of decentralization, tokenization and staking.  But there is something bigger here than election math.  Too quick or too slow, the digital assets industry is inching toward regulation and compliance. The new European Parliament and the new College of Commissioners will make a difference on whether this path is bumpy or smooth. But compliance is not enough for the industry in the long run.  These elections come at a crucial time in Europe’s history. Far-right movements are using the continent’s depressed growth and high inflation to seed anti-European sentiments. Elected leaders have put E.U. competitiveness and the need for more active capital markets top of the agenda.  The digital assets industry has some way to go to establish trust and credibility. Whom it chooses to associate with in the next five years will be telling of what the industry stands for.

42408113,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga9Dre,1718110800,Maybe Old-Fashioned Venture Capital Wasn't So Bad After All,"As the founder of a layer-2 blockchain focused on consumer crypto – meaning user-friendly applications that can achieve mass adoption – I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about why it’s more popular to talk about consumer crypto than invest in it. It’s a common complaint among builders that infrastructure not only gets all the love, but also gets all the money.  While this might seem rich coming from the founder of an infrastructure project, since our success should technically depend on consumer crypto adoption, it’s an important problem to solve. The more I thought about it, the more I realized it takes stepping back to understand the incentives of the people investing in these would-be consumer applications.  Azeem Khan is the founder of Morph, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) layer-2 blockchain in testnet.  It often seems crypto investors aren’t in alignment with the projects they invest in. Maybe that's because tokens are changing how venture capital works as a whole. Then again, venture capital isn’t a monolith.  If we want consumer applications to receive investment, it will require more honest conversations about what project founders and their financial backers want to achieve.  If you were to ask anyone who understands venture capital or asked your favorite search engine how it works you’d likely see about the same response: private equity financing in which investors provide money to startups, take equity and traditionally look to see returns over 10 years. To date, that is mostly how venture capital has worked.  So when you go to a venture capitalist in crypto, that’s what you’d expect, right? Not so fast. Token launches have changed everything.  Tokens' impact  Take Ethereum. It’s not only one of the best-known blockchains but also the one where the majority of builders are. But Ethereum’s true innovation was becoming a platform where anyone could launch a consumer crypto application – and corresponding token for utility.  VCs saw another opportunity here, organizing multi-billion dollar token raises for so-called “Ethereum killers.” While many of these projects failed, leaving behind inactive ghost chains, it’s been a profitable endeavor for many of the investors who poured money into them. And this gets into the nature of how tokens work.  Before the introduction of token launches, venture capitalists used to invest in businesses where they received equity only – think Meta, Airbnb, Roblox and so on. The way to make the money back on their investment was either having another company acquire the startup they invested in or having the company do an initial public offering (IPO) on the stock market. This is part of the reason it took so long for venture capitalists to see returns on their investments.  Since the advent of blockchain-based tokens, investors willing to fund crypto projects have found another avenue to get their returns, often much faster.  The way venture capital agreements work with Web3 startups these days is the investors take a percentage of tokens, equity or both depending on the investment agreement. One of the main things those investors need to work out is how those token allocations work. That’s a new problem, unseen in traditional venture capital.  The two main things to look at are the “lockup” period, which is how many months after the token launch an investor must wait before they start vesting their tokens, as well as the length of that vesting period (total token allocation will be based on the investment as a percentage of total token supply).  The final thing to consider is that the tokens these investors get have liquidity, meaning they can easily be sold for cash on an open market. This starkly contrasts the equity-only model where it’s way harder to sell your stake.  Impatient capital  Bringing this back to the beginning, if investors used to have to wait almost a decade to see if their investments were successful, but now can start to cash out within a year under token agreements, perhaps it’s time we started to rethink venture capital.  Maybe it’s time that we start to examine which investors are looking to do 100x-1000x on their investments over a decade, and which ones are looking to do smaller returns over a shorter period of time. The former is the one that will lead to consumer adoption, because we need to educate people why blockchain is better for consumers, build the products, launch them, get regulators on board, and actually be in a place where the blockchains can handle the traffic, all of which take time. The latter will only continue to further enrich already wealthy VCs, which is the opposite of what we need.  Hopefully, an honest conversation about the evolving nature of venture capital will pave the way for more investment in the right infrastructure and consumer applications in the crypto world.

42417948,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTc73d,1718107260,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Falls Below $67K as ETFs' Inflows Streak Ends,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin fell below $67,000 during the European morning, extending a drop from $72,000 that commenced on Friday. The decline follows $65 million in cumulative outflows from the U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs on Monday, the first loss since at least May 23, according to provisional data published by Farside Investors. Inflows have recently been strong, although the market chatter is that they stem from institutions' growing interest in the non-directional basis trade rather than outright bullish bets. At the time of writing, BTC is more than 3.5% lower than 24 hours ago. The broader digital market has followed suit, with ether dropping over 4% to $3,540 and the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) falling almost 3.4%.  GameStop shares fell 12% on Monday, weighing heavily on some meme tokens that tend to mirror the stock's movements. Solana-based meme token GME, which parodies the company's stock ticker, slid 25%, reversing a more-than 200% rally over the past seven days. Related tokens like Roaring Kitty and some cat-themed tokens, which previously moved alongside GME stock, lost an average of at least 10%, according to data tracked by CoinGecko. Dog-themed tokens doge, shiba inu and floki pared last week's gains, falling from 4% to 10%. GameStop shares have sunk 62% from a two-year high on Thursday after the company said it would sell up to 75 million shares and announced a drop in quarterly sales.  The Cardano network is set to move into the final phase of a multiyear program to become a wholly decentralized blockchain ecosystem later this month, co-founder Charles Hoskinson said in an X post. Once the switch is complete, Cardano will no longer be actively managed by Cardano development firm IOHK but will be wholly run by community members. “It looks like June will be the month that Cardano Node will reach 9.0,“ Hoskinson posted. “This means that Cardano is Chang fork ready and waiting for 70 percent of the SPOs to install the new node. Then, a hard fork can occur pushing Cardano into the Age of Voltaire.” Native token ADA has fallen 3.4% in the last 24 hours, broadly in line with the CD20.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the most active ether options on Deribit in the past 24 hours. Puts are shown in red, calls in green.  Investors have increasingly traded put options, offering downside protection.  Ether's price has declined over 4.1% in 24 hours.

29308556,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=615126,1718107220,Blood In The Water? Ethereum Whales Circle As Price Drops,"Ethereum (ETH), the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has created a perplexing scenario for investors recently. Despite a noticeable decline in its price, on-chain data reveals that large investors, often referred to as “whales,” are accumulating ETH. This could signal a potential buying opportunity, though technical indicators suggest a weakening uptrend, leaving Ethereum’s near-term future uncertain. Related Reading: Solana Searching For Direction: Will SOL Break Free Or Fall Flat? Ethereum Whales See Opportunity In Price Dip In recent analysis by NewsBTC, it was revealed that wallets holding over 10,000 ETH have been steadily acquiring more tokens since the end of May. This period of accumulation, based on Glassnode data, coincides with a drop in Ethereum’s price from around $3,074 to its current price of $3,670. The significant increase in holdings by these large investors suggests that they see the current price decline as an attractive entry point, anticipating a future price rise. Adding to the bullish sentiment, CryptoQuant’s Netflow data for Ethereum has shown a dominance of negative flows in recent weeks. This means more ETH is leaving exchanges than entering them, a traditional indicator that investors are holding onto their ETH rather than selling it. This behavior can reduce the available supply on the market, potentially pushing prices up in the long run. Related Reading: $2 Billion Crypto Funds Flow Into Market On Rate Cut Buzz Technical Indicators Raise Red Flags Despite the optimistic signs from whale accumulation and exchange outflows, technical indicators paint a less rosy picture. Ethereum has been trading in a narrow range around $3,600 for the past three days, showing a slight decline of approximately 0.8% today. While the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains above 50, indicating a slight uptrend, it is currently on a downward trajectory. If this trend continues and the RSI falls below the neutral line, it could suggest a potential price dip. The number of #Ethereum addresses holding 10,000+ $ETH has increased by 3% in the last three weeks, signaling an important spike in buying pressure! pic.twitter.com/7qq5HgGP37 — Ali (@ali_charts) June 9, 2024 The RSI’s downward movement indicates weakening momentum, which, if not reversed, might lead to further declines in Ethereum’s price. This bearish technical outlook contrasts sharply with the positive on-chain data, creating a complex situation for investors trying to predict the market’s next move. Market Awaits A Significant Catalyst The near-term future of Ethereum appears to hinge on the emergence of a significant catalyst. Broader market sentiment could play a crucial role, with a positive shift potentially reigniting the uptrend. Additionally, upcoming news or developments specific to the Ethereum network could also serve as a catalyst for price movement. Successful upgrades or increased adoption of decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Ethereum blockchain could trigger renewed investor interest and drive prices higher.

29306238,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=615105,1718103632,Bitcoin Set for Further Decline As Bearish Sentiment Intensifies,"Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, appears to be heading for further declines as market sentiment turns increasingly bearish. Recent analysis shows that BTC is struggling to maintain key support levels, and the overall mood among traders and investors is shifting towards caution. Several factors such as macroeconomic pressures, regulatory concerns, and technical indicators contribute to this negative outlook. As Bitcoin continues to face selling pressure, the potential for additional downside becomes more pronounced. This article explores Bitcoin’s near-term price action for market participants looking to navigate the current volatility and make informed decisions about their BTC holdings. Currently, the price of BTC is down by -2,50%, trading at about $67,796, with a market capitalization of over $1.3 trillion and a trading volume of over $29 billion as of the time of writing. Although its market capitalization is down by 2.44%, its trading volume is up by 94,43% in the past day. Technical Analysis Points Further Decline In Bitcoin Price BTC on the 4-hour timeframe has dropped below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) with strong momentum by dropping two bearish candlesticks. With such momentum, the price of BTC may decline more. The 4-hour RSI has also experienced a huge drop below 50% trending close to the oversold zone. This confirms that BTC may still witness more price declines. On the daily timeframe, BTC’s price with a strong momentum is making a significant drop toward the 100-day SMA with a huge bearish candlestick. Based on the above price action, it can be suggested that BTC may remain bearish for the rest of the day. Finally, the 1-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) also suggests that the price of Bitcoin is likely to decline more, as the RSI line has dropped slightly below 50% and might trend there for a while. More Losses For BTC? Based on price analysis and what the RSI indicator suggests, if Bitcoin continues to decline, it will move toward the $66,736 support level. If it breaks this level, it will decline further to test the $64,515 support level. There is a possibility that it might even drop more to test the $60,158 if the aforementioned level cannot hold the price. However, suppose BTC decides to reverse course at any of the previously suggested support levels, it will start to ascend toward the direction of the $71,909 resistance level. If the price breaks above this resistance level, it may move to test the $73,811 level and possibly move further to create a new all-time high.

Cryptocurrency ETFs offer exposure by investing directly in the assets and/or companies involved in the digital economy. 5 crypto-focused ETFs, +240% on average in 1Y, offer exposure to several digital assets and firms involved in the digital economy for investors with an appetite for risk. Crypto Investing Cryptocurrencies have exploded in the past year, with Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) up ~170%, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) ~+100%, and Solana ( SOL-USD ) more than 930%. Digital assets are progressing on the regulatory fronts and have even become hotter topics, particularly in the wake of Robinhood’s $200M acquisition of Bitstamp . Bitstamp is a small crypto exchange competitor behind Binance and Coinbase Global ( COIN ). The acquisition of Bitstamp is a major step in growing our crypto business. Bitstamp’s highly trusted and long-standing global exchange has shown resilience through market cycles…Through this strategic combination, we are better positioned to expand our footprint outside of the U.S. and welcome institutional customers to Robinhood,"" said Johann Kerbrat , general manager of Robinhood Crypto. According to Statista Market Insights , the total number of cryptocurrency users worldwide could reach 992.50M by 2028, driven by increasing institutional acceptance and higher usage in cross-border transactions. Crypto Users Projected to Reach 992.5M by 2028 Crypto User Forecast to 2028 (Statista) The price of Bitcoin crossed the $1.00 threshold for the first time ever in February of 2011, and nearly ten years ago was worth $580. Bitcoin is now trading at more than $71,800 with a market cap of $1.4T. Bitcoin has about 53% of the crypto market followed by Ether (17%), Tether ( USDT-USD ) (4.2%), Binance Coin ( BNB ) (4%), and Solana (3%). Bitcoin and Ether dominate in size, but Solana is the highest-performing cryptocurrency among the digital asset giants in the past year. Solana Leads Top 5 Cryptocurrencies in 1Y Price Performance (as of 6/10/24) Top Cryptocurrencies 1Y Performance (SA Premium) Seeking Alpha’s Quant ETF Grades are generated by a proprietary system that aims to provide investors an instant characterization of each ETF. The SA quant system grades ETFs by five factors: Momentum, Expenses, Dividends, Risk and Liquidity. Key ETF metrics are systematically gathered and compared to the median of all ETFs, then assigned a grade from A+ to F. Investors can go to the SA Quant Top Rated ETFs screener to quickly view ETFs with the highest quant ratings. Investors can use advanced filters to view a wide-range of ETF asset classes and sub classes including digital assets. Cryptocurrency-focused ETFs invest directly in the digital assets or indirectly in miners and stocks involved in crypto. Although crypto ETFs have strong momentum, investors should realize they are also highly volatile. The SA Quant Team identified five ETFs that provide investors exposure to a variety of crypto assets. The ETFs have ‘Strong Buy’ ratings and excellent momentum, evidenced by a market-crushing average 1Y price performance of ~+240%. The list includes 2 ETFs ranked outside of the top five to prevent overlaps and ensure breadth of coverage of major digital assets. 1. Valkyrie Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF (NASDAQ: BTF ) Assets ((AUM)): $54.72M Quant Rating: Strong Buy Quant Ranking in Asset Class (as of 6/10/24): 2 out of 197 Quant Ranking in Asset Sub Class (as of 6/10/24): 2 out of 21 BTF is an actively managed ETF focused on bitcoin and ether futures contracts, up 140% in total returns in the past year, and among the top quant-rated ETFs in both the Alternative asset class and Digital sub class. BTF has a Strong Buy rating driven by excellent Momentum and Dividends ETF Factor Grades. BTF ETF Factor Grades (SA Premium) BTF’s holdings , rebalanced on a monthly basis, are split nearly evenly between Ether and Bitcoin futures contracts. BTF is up ~140% in total return in the past 1Y, crushing the 12% median for an A+ Momentum Grade. BTF 10% dividend yield vs. an ETF median of 2.5%, and annual payout of $2.23, drives an A+ Dividends grade. BTF’s low AUM of $54.72M and average daily dollar volume of less than 1M underpins a ‘C’ in Liquidity . BTF has a 1.24% expense ratio vs. a 0.48% ETF median, resulting in a low mark in Expenses , although its bid/ask spread of 0.21% is not too far above the median of 0.14%. BTF annualized volatility is nearly 50% vs. an ETF median of 12%, and tracking error year 1 is 60% vs. a median of 7%, driving a low Risk grade. 2. Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund ETF ( OTCQX: GDLC ) Assets ( AUM ): $582.92M Quant Rating: Strong Buy Quant Ranking in Asset Class (as of 6/10/24): 6 out of 197 Quant Ranking in Asset Sub Class (as of 6/10/24): 6 out of 21 Only three among 2,462 quant-rated ETFs have a higher 1Y price performance than GDLC, which is up a whopping 322% in the past 12 months, driving an ‘A+’ in Momentum .

GBTC has returned more than 490% to shareholders in the past five years vs. an ETF median of 38%, and significantly outperformed in returns over the last 6M and 30 days. GBTC’s A+ in Liquidity is driven by an AUM of $19.76B and a daily dollar volume of $620.65M. GBT expense ratio is 1.50%, annualized volatility 58%, and 1Y tracking error 58%. GBTC Momentum Grade (SA Premium) 4.

BITW has a 2.5% expense ratio , 67% annualized volatility , and 58% tracking error 1Y. BITW Portfolio Breakdown BITW Portfolio Breakdown (Bitwise) Risks Risk of loss from investments in crypto-related securities remains significant for individual investors. Crypto-related securities are highly volatile, exceptionally speculative, and operate in an environment of regulatory uncertainty ; hence could decline significantly and without warning. Concluding Summary Cryptocurrencies have seen explosive growth in the past year, with the total number of users expected to reach more than 992M by 2028 as digital assets become more accepted by institutions and used in cross-border transactions. SA’s Quant Team has identified five crypto-focused ETFs that provide investors with exposure to digital assets through direct investments or investments in companies involved in the digital economy.

Bitdeer offers Bitcoin cloud mining services and has a global presence in North America, Europe, and Asia, with strong financials and operational growth. Bitdeer's heavy investment in R&D is paying off with the development of proprietary chips and mining rigs, called the SEALMINER, positioning the company as a vertically integrated miner with promising prospects. BTDR CLSK CORZ BITF MARA Jan. - Apr. average BTC mined ~292 ~687 ~907 ~303 ~915 May (post-halving) BTC production 184 417 448 156 616 Post-halving percentage -/+ (based on May production updates) -37% -39% -50% -48% -32% Most Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miners have released their first monthly production updates (May CY2024) post the Bitcoin halving event. At this point in the cycle, I believe it is paramount for investors to monitor miners with the best operating efficiency and who are the least impacted by the halving event. Since May's Bitcoin production report started pouring in, miners' monthly Bitcoin production has dropped by an average of around 47% compared to their monthly average since the start of the year, during pre-halving months (i.e. January to April). Marathon Digital ( MARA ) shows a 32% drop in BTC produced, Bitfarms ( BITF ) saw a 48% drop, Core Scientific ( CORZ ) saw around a 50% drop, and CleanSpark ( CLSK ) witnessed around a 39% drop in production. One of the miners least impacted by the halving (following the first monthly production update since halving) is Bitdeer ( BTDR ). Bitdeer reported a 37% drop in monthly mined Bitcoin, producing 184 BTC compared to its pre-halving average of around 292 BTC. Bitdeer diversifies its operations by offering AI cloud solutions as well as Bitcoin cloud mining. Cloud mining fractionalizes access to Bitcoin mining. Users from anywhere in the world can visit the Bitdeer website and purchase a desired amount of mining hashrate on a desired hardware without the need to worry about setting up or maintaining mining hardware or software. Bitdeer is one of the two publicly traded miners that offer Bitcoin cloud mining. The other publicly traded miner that offers cloud mining services is BitFuFu ( FUFU ); both firms have early ties to BITMAIN. Bitdeer was a spin-off of BITMAIN's cloud mining division, which was headed by BitFuFu's now co-founder Leo Lu. BitFuFu is a lesser-known miner. I recently covered BitFuFu here on Seeking Alpha. Bitdeer is one of the few miners with a data center presence in North America, Europe, and Asia. In the U.S., Bitdeer operates data centers in the Quincy region of Washington State, Texas, as well as in Tennessee. The company's Europe mining operation is based in Norway, where it runs a data center in Molde and another in Tydal. Last August, Bitdeer commenced mining operations in Bhutan , South Asia, after completing a 100MW data center there. Bhutan's renewable hydropower energy generation is a key element for the nation's economy, and Bitcoin mining is a top agenda for the nation's government. The Himalayan kingdom keeps ramping up its energy capacity for Bitcoin mining. Bitdeer has the strongest miner footing in Bhutan, and this means a lot to Bitdeer's global expansion strategy and long-term sustainability goal. Q1 operations update (Bitdeer) Bitdeer's financials are strong and operational highlights show steady growth. Total hashrate increased from 18.3 exahash in Q1 CY23 to 22.5 exahash in Q1 CY24. Q1's reported revenue came in at $119 million - a 64.6% YoY growth. The company's net income came in at $0.6 million - an outstanding improvement over Q1 CY23's $9.5 million in net losses. The profitable bottom line was driven by a $34.1 gross profit. The company also incurred a $14.1 million one-off incremental development expense related to a proprietary mining chip it is producing. Bitdeer has a strong balance sheet, with about $118 million in cash and cash equivalents and around $26 million in crypto holdings. Net assets exceed total liabilities, indicating a positive equity position and a very healthy financial cushion. Total assets are around $691 million and total liabilities are around $300 million as of Q1 CY24. Data by YCharts Total expenses in Q1 were $33.6 million, of which about 63% was taken up by R&D expenses. Bitdeer is heavy on R&D and about 25% of the company workforce is focused on R&D. Why is Bitdeer spending heavy on R&D? The company plans to launch some of the most efficient mining rigs based on Bitdeer's in-house chip and software technologies. The mining chips called the SEAL and the mining rigs called SEALMINER will be released based on a roadmap, and each release will be more energy-efficient than the previous. This is an ambitious endeavor for a Bitcoin miner, and this makes Bitdeer even more attractive. Bitdeer seems to have the highest R&D-to-sales ratio currently among publicly traded Bitcoin miners; my perusal of trailing twelve-month financials among miners shows Bitdeer is currently spending more in that regard. SEALMINER Roadmap (Bitdeer) The results of the substantial R&D spending are becoming evident - at least going by updates from Bitdeer. The company's proprietary SEAL01 chips (the first batch of chips) integrated into SEALMINER A1 mining machines have an efficiency of 18.1 J/TH, while the wall-mount power consumption of the SEALMINER A1 is expected to be between 20J/TH and 23J/TH. Wall-mount power consumption considers the overall power consumption of the mining machine, including not just the energy consumed by the SEAL01 chip, but also other components such as cooling systems, and control boards. SEALMINER A1 machines will be deployed at Bitdeer's own facilities first later this month for field-testing, after which mass production and delivery of the SEALMINER A1 mining rigs will kick off in Q3 this year, according to Bitdeer's SEALMINER roadmap . Going by current mining rig stats, Bitdeer's inaugural miner falls slightly behind the latest miners released by Canaan ( CAN ) and BITMAIN in terms of energy efficiency. Canaan's A1466I maintains an efficiency of around 19.5 J/TH. BITMAIN's hydro-cooled S21 miners maintain an efficiency of around 16 J/TH, while the air-cooled S21 maintains an efficiency of around 17.5 J/TH. Second-gen SEALMINER machines, expected to be mass-produced in Q4 this year, will be equipped with the SEAL02 chips and will be more energy efficient than the inaugural SEALMINER A1, according to BITMAIN. The chips are expected to have an efficiency of 14 J/TH, while the rigs will maintain an efficiency between 15 J/TH and 16.5 J/TH. A third-gen of Bitdeer's proprietary miners and chips are expected to be mass-produced and delivered in Q2 next year, with the rigs maintaining an efficiency between 11 J/TH and 12 J/TH. A later release slated for Q2 2025 and expected to be mass-produced in Q4 2025 will feature the SEAL04 chip and the rigs will operate at an efficiency between 5.5 J/TH and 6 J/TH. Looking beyond the intended sales of these miners, potential market penetration challenges, and the competition Bitdeer will face from existing mining rig manufacturers, Bitdeer's venture into proprietary hardware manufacture makes it one of the most vertically integrated Bitcoin miners at the moment. As a proprietary maker of its own mining equipment, Bitdeer will have the advantage of being able to control certain variables. The backwards integration will help the company plan better and evade some supply chain disruptions; this is great for the company's strategic timings, as Bitcoin mining is a time-sensitive business. Bottom Line What makes Bitdeer an attractive miner is its continuous efforts at being a vertically integrated miner and the obvious market advantages this gives the company. Bitdeer holds great prospects. The financials look very healthy. If they can achieve the 5 J/TH efficiency with the SEAL04 chips slated for mass production in Q4 next year (according to their roadmap), that would be a massive achievement. I believe that this announced chip and rig production roadmap has not been priced in yet into BTDR. As seen in the chart above, BTDR has greatly underperformed most of its peers in price return in the 1-year time frame.

The price-to-hash (P/H) ratio is a Bitcoin miner-specific metric that takes into account a miner's Enterprise Value and its realized hashrate to determine how much an investor pays per share for every TH/s of Bitcoin mined.

The Fed should move away from its 2% inflation target, the letter added.  The Federal Reserve (Fed) has kept the interest rate too high for too long and it's time for a cut, three Democrat senators said Monday in a letter to the central bank's chairman, Jerome Powell.  ""We write today to urge the Federal Reserve (the Fed) to cut the federal funds rate from its current, two-decade-high of 5.5 percent. This sustained period of high interest rates is already slowing the economy and is failing to address the remaining key drivers of inflation,"" Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) and John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) wrote, according to a document on the HuffPost website.  In response to the surprisingly resilient labor market, financial markets pushed out expectations for a first 25 basis-point interest-rate cut to September from July. The hawkish repricing has stalled a rally in bitcoin {{BTC}}.  The senators argue that the elevated interest-rate environment aimed at taming inflation adds to the problem by pushing up housing, construction and auto insurance costs, and risks propelling the economy into a recession that could "" push thousands of American workers out of their jobs.""

The senators said it's time for the Fed to follow the European Central Bank's lead and move away from the 2% inflation target. The ECB and Bank of Canada cut rates last week, diverging from the Fed's higher-for-longer stance.  According to the letter, the divergence could lead to a stronger dollar and tighter financial conditions or flow of credit through various sectors of the economy.

The Cardano Node will reach version 9.0, making it ready for a hard fork to enter the Voltaire era.  The Cardano network is set to move into the final phase of a multiyear program to become a wholly decentralized blockchain ecosystem later this month, co-founder Charles Hoskinson said in an X post Monday.  As a first step, the validating node software operated by the system's stake pool operators, or SPOs, needs to be upgraded to the latest version. Then, the blockchain will evolve into a backward-incompatible version, a process known as a hard fork, and in doing so, enter a new era known as Voltaire. Cardano is currently in its Basho era.  The project's roadmap says that once the switch is complete, the seven-year-old blockchain will no longer be actively managed by Cardano development firm IOHK but will instead be wholly run by community members.  “It looks like June will be the month that Cardano Node will reach 9.0,“ Hoskinson posted. “This means that Cardano is Chang fork ready and waiting for 70 percent of the SPOs to install the new node. Then, a hard fork can occur pushing Cardano into the Age of Voltaire.”  “We'll have the most advanced blockchain governance system, annual budgets, a treasury, and the wisdom of our entire community to guide us,” he added.  According to governance forums and blog posts, the first part of Voltaire will see the implementation of CIP 1694, a proposal that will allow holders of the native {{ADA}} token to vote on topics and features that benefit Cardano. A second step will enable more novel features, such as proxy participation and treasury withdrawals, allowing users to propose and fund projects within the Cardano ecosystem.

CoinShares, a leading digital asset manager, reported a record-breaking $2 billion influx into crypto funds in just one week, surpassing the entire month of May’s net inflows. This positive trend, now spanning five consecutive weeks, has propelled total assets under management (AUM) in crypto funds back above the coveted $100 billion mark, a level last seen in March 2024. Related Reading: Solana Searching For Direction: Will SOL Break Free Or Fall Flat? Bitcoin ETFs Fueling The Fire Bitcoin, the undisputed king of cryptocurrencies, remains the primary focus of investor interest. The recent launch and sustained inflows into US-approved spot Bitcoin ETFs are a major driver of the current market sentiment. These exchange-traded funds, which allow investors to hold Bitcoin without directly owning the digital asset, saw $890 million pour in on June 4th alone, marking their third-largest inflow day ever. This enthusiasm for Bitcoin ETFs suggests a growing appetite for regulated and accessible ways to participate in the crypto market, potentially attracting a broader range of investors. Ethereum Shines Bright, Altcoins Show Promise While Bitcoin takes center stage, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, is also enjoying a strong run. Ethereum funds raked in nearly $70 million last week, marking their best week since March 2024. CoinShares attributes this positive inflow to investor anticipation surrounding the upcoming launch of spot Ethereum ETFs in the US. The approval of these ETFs could further legitimize the Ethereum ecosystem and unlock significant investment potential. Beyond the top two coins, altcoins like Fantom and XRP are also experiencing a resurgence in investor interest, with inflows of $1.4 million and $1.2 million, respectively. This broader market participation suggests a potential return of investor confidence across the crypto landscape. CoinShares said it observed that inflows were unusually widespread across nearly all providers, coupled with a continued reduction in outflows from incumbents. They attribute this shift in sentiment to weaker-than-expected macroeconomic data in the US, which has heightened expectations for an imminent monetary policy rate cut. Total crypto market cap at $2.4 trillion on the daily chart: TradingView.com Crypto Price Stagnation, Economic Uncertainty Despite the surge in fund inflows, cryptocurrency prices haven’t exhibited a corresponding significant upward movement.

29298190,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=612380,1718091040,FOMC Preview: How Will Bitcoin And Crypto React? All You Need To Know,"As the financial markets brace for the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Wednesday, June 12th, the Bitcoin and crypto community is poised to assess the implications of any Federal Reserve announcements on digital assets such as Bitcoin. With the consensus forecast suggesting that the Federal Reserve will hold the federal funds rate steady at 5.25%-5.50%, the primary interest of investors has turned to the nuances of the Fed’s forward guidance and economic projections. Crypto analyst Tomo (@Market_Look) shared his insights on X, framing the upcoming FOMC meeting as a non-event for those expecting drastic moves. He stated, “Interest rates are likely to remain unchanged (5.25%-5.50%). There will likely not be any major changes to the statement or economic outlook, and the dot chart is expected to shift in a hawkish direction.” Tomo also highlighted the anticipated adjustments in the rate projections for the coming years, noting, “In 2024, the rate will shift from 3 cuts to 2 cuts. The hawkish surprise will be 1 cut.” He explained that the market has already priced in these expected adjustments, suggesting minimal surprise and limited market volatility in response. Related Reading: Hedge Funds Heavily Betting For Bitcoin To Fall: Will This Strategy Fail? “As of March, the distribution of dots for 2024 is 9 people in favor of keeping interest rates unchanged or cutting them twice, and 10 people in favor of cutting interest rates three or more times… a shift from three to two is already factored in.” Banking giant ING’s team of economists, including James Knightley and Padhraic Garvey, CFA, share a similar conservative outlook on the Federal Reserve’s potential moves. They anticipate that the Fed will underscore its cautious stance due to persistent inflation and strong employment figures, potentially delaying rate cuts further into the future. The ING team elaborated on their expectations, “The US Fed accepts that monetary policy is restrictive, but lingering inflation and strong jobs numbers mean it will indicate it’s prepared to wait longer before seriously considering interest rate cuts.” They anticipate that the dot plot, which will reveal individual FOMC members’ rate predictions, will show a reduction in the number of projected rate cuts for 2024 from three to possibly one or two. According to Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal, JPMorgan and Citigroup have withdrawn their predictions for a rate cut in July following the recent jobs report last Friday. Currently, the majority of sell-side economists and other experts monitoring the Federal Reserve anticipate one or two rate reductions in either September or December of this year. JPM and Citi scrapped their calls for a July rate cut after last Friday’s jobs report. Most sell-side economists and other professional Fed watchers now anticipate one or two rate cuts this year in either September or December pic.twitter.com/x9tUD06Pmi — Nick Timiraos (@NickTimiraos) June 10, 2024 Impact On Bitcoin And Crypto Bitcoin and the broader crypto market have been quite sensitive to macro economic data recently. The anticipation of a dovish turn—particularly any hints of rate cuts—could weaken the dollar and bolster Bitcoin and other digital assets as alternative investments. Related Reading: Buy Or Sell Bitcoin Now? Analyst Reveals Ultimate Bias Guide Conversely, a reaffirmation of the current rate or a less dovish stance than expected could strengthen the dollar and apply downward pressure on crypto markets. However, the nuanced perspectives of FOMC members, as reflected in the dot plot and the accompanying economic projections, could provide clues about the medium-term trajectory of US monetary policy, which in turn could affect investor sentiment in the crypto markets. A hawkish tilt, suggesting fewer or delayed rate cuts, might strengthen the US dollar and put downward pressure on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Conversely, any dovish signals or indications of a softer stance on rate increases in the near future could buoy the crypto market. During the FOMC press conference, Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks will be crucial for setting the tone and expectations. Market participants will closely analyze his comments for any shifts in tone regarding inflation, economic growth, and future monetary policy adjustments. The interpretation of these remarks could lead to significant price movements in the Bitcoin and crypto markets. Moreover, the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for May 2024 just hours before the FOMC meeting will be critical. These data points will provide essential context for the Fed’s decisions, influencing their assessment of whether the current policy stance remains appropriate.

Meme token GME and KITTY fall 25% and 10%, respectively.  The controversial GameStop (GME) stock rally saw its second day of reversing on Monday, ending the U.S. trading session down 12% after a 40% drop on Friday This weighed down some meme tokens that tend to mirror the stock’s movements.  GME ended Monday trading at $24.89, down 62% from a two-year high of $61 last Thursday. Elsewhere, the Solana-based meme token GME, which parodies the company, slid 25%, reversing a more than 200% rally from the past seven days.  Related tokens like Roaring Kitty (KITTY) and some cat-themed tokens, which previously moved alongside GME stock, lost an average of at least 10%, according to data tracked by CoinGecko.

Gill flashed a $580 million position of GME equity and options holdings last week, boosting the stock’s prices and putting him on track to a potential billion-dollar exposure position.

42417949,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTc74f,1718089200,"ZKsync’s ZK Airdrop Is Coming ‘Next Week,’ Here's What to Expect","Matter Labs, the main development firm behind the layer-2 network ZKsync era, has officially disclosed the distribution criteria for its long-awaited ZK token airdrop. According to the plan released Tuesday, 17.5% of ZK's 21 billion total token supply will be airdropped to users beginning ""next week.""  Like other layer-2 networks, ZKsync Era pitches itself as a quick and cheap way to send transactions on Ethereum. According to Matter Labs, the ZK airdrop will be the “largest distribution of tokens to users amongst major L2s,” with just under 3.7 billion tokens going to users.  Pre-market prices from Aevo, a crypto perpetuals exchange that currently values ZK at $.66, would place the airdrop's fully diluted value (FDV) above $2.5 billion, which is nearly triple ZKsync Era's current total value locked (TVL) of $815 million.  Under the distribution plan, 89% of the airdrop will go to ZKsync users, a group that includes anyone who has transacted on ZKsync and met a certain threshold of activity (a specific threshold was not provided). The remaining 11% will go towards contributors to the ecosystem, including zkSync native projects (5.8%), on-chain communities (2.8%) and builders (2.4%).  The airdrop news comes as Matter Labs continues to receive backlash from its layer-2 peers over its decision to trademark the term “ZK,” which is shorthand for ""zero-knowledge” cryptography, the core technology underlying ZKsync and a plethora of other blockchain projects. After criticism from the crypto community, Matter Labs withdrew its trademark application, which it originally said it pursued to protect its users from similarly-named projects and token tickers.  Matter Labs said that the airdrop will cap the amount that any given address can receive at 100,000 tokens. “By capping whales, the ZK airdrop fairly rewards community members that contribute to ZKsync in different ways,” Matter Labs wrote in a press release seen by CoinDesk. (""Whales"" is crypto-speak for especially big-pocketed traders.)  The team also shared that Matter Labs employees will get 16.1% of ZK tokens, and Matter Labs investors 17.2%. Those tokens will be locked for a year and then unlocked over the course of three more years.  The rest of the token supply will go to ZKsync’s new ""Token Assembly"" (29.3%) as part of its new governance plans laid out on Monday, and various Ecosystem Initiatives (19.9%).  “Awarding more tokens in the airdrop than to the Matter Labs team and investors is more than a symbolic decision for the community,"" Matter Labs wrote in a statement shared with CoinDesk. ""When the ZKsync governance system launches in the coming weeks, the community will have the largest supply of liquid tokens to direct protocol governance upgrades.”  Airdrop politics  The airdrop follows a series of other airdrops, like those from StarkNet and EigenLayer, which outraged some users who expected to receive larger allotments of tokens. In the case of EigenLayer, in particular, some users took issue with the team's decision to strictly bar airdrop claimants from the U.S. and a long list of other countries.  “We have put a lot of thought into the design of the airdrop,"" Alex Gluchowski, the CEO of Matter Labs, told CoinDesk in an interview. “No matter what you do, some people are going to be disappointed, but we have looked into others,"" he said.  Among the ""key pillars"" Gluchowski's team used to inform its distribution plan, ""number one"" was to ""prioritize community heavily,"" said the Matter Labs CEO.  Gluchowksi mentioned in the interview that “certain jurisdictions are excluded because they are either banned by sanctioned regimes or are just not welcome, unfortunately for crypto projects doing airdrops, so we have to be compliant and respect those laws.” He did not specify what countries would be allowed to claim tokens, and he didn't say what methods ZKsync would use to enforce its region restrictions.  ZK drama  The news of the airdrop criteria follows after Matter Labs found itself in hot water with competitors Polygon and Starkware over its applications to trademark the term “ZK.” Given that ZK technology and the term ZK are used by many teams in the Ethereum ecosystem, the trademark filing was seen as an attempt by Matter Labs to seize ownership over a ""public good.""  Gluchowski was defiant when he spoke to CoinDesk this week.  “The guys who have accused us registered “STARK” as a trademark,” Gluchowski said, seeming to reference Starkware. (A “STARK” is a type of zero-knowledge proof that was created by Starkware co-founder Eli Ben-Sasson but is now ubiquitous among Ethereum layer-2 teams.)  “I mean what are we talking about? Everyone has registered trademarks for their products, for their tokens, for whatever,"" Gluchowski continued.  Gluchowski added, though, that they listened to the community and decided to withdraw their trademark application. “We did not want to leave even the slightest impression that we are trying to manipulate the system to our advantage,” he told CoinDesk.

The price is now moving lower and there is risk of more downsides below $600. BNB price started a fresh decline below the $650 support zone. The price is now trading below $650 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $650 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair could gain bearish momentum if there is a close below the $600 support. BNB Price Trims Gains After a major increase, BNB price struggled near the $720 resistance. As a result, there was a bearish reaction below the $680 support, like Ethereum and Bitcoin. The price dipped below the $650 support and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). It traded as low as $613 and is currently consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $724 swing high to the $613 low. The price is now trading below $650 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Immediate resistance is near the $630 level. The next resistance sits near the $640 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $650 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. A clear move above the $650 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $665. A close above the $665 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $672 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $680 level in the coming days. More Losses? If BNB fails to clear the $640 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $615 level. The next major support is near the $605 level. The main support sits at $600. If there is a downside break below the $600 support, the price could drop toward the $580 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $550 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BNB/USD is currently below the 50 level.

The U.S.-listed spot BTC ETFs registered a cumulative outflow of over $64 million on Monday.  It was a risk-off day in Asia.  Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, fell over 2% to $67,900, extending the retreat from recent highs near $72,000. Ether, the second-largest coin, followed suit, dipping below $3,550 at one point. The broader CoinDesk 20 Index fell 1% to $2,370 points.  The losses followed $64.9 million in cumulative outflows from the U.S.-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the first loss since at least May 23, according to provisional data published by Farside Investors. Inflows have recently been strong, although the market chatter is that they stem from institutions' growing interest in the non-directional basis trade rather than outright bullish bets.  In traditional markets, Chinese stocks fell over 1%, leading losses in the Asian equity indices amid lingering property market concerns and reports the Bank of Japan could trim its liquidity-boosting bond purchases this week.  The dollar index, which gauges the greenback's exchange rate against a basket of major fiat currencies, consolidated on two-day gains while prices for the supposed safe haven U.S. Treasuries ticked higher, pushing yields lower. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note fell by three basis points to 4.45%, according to charting platform TradingView.  Recent gains for right-wing parties in European elections and a snap poll announcement by France revived concerns about the cohesion of the European Union, adding uncertainty in the market.  \Meanwhile, Wednesday's U.S. CPI release and the Fed rate decision kept investors on the edge.

On Friday, the token retraced to as low as $0.1155 after reaching its record high. In a recent social media post on Sunday, Iggy Azalea revealed plans to revive a co-founded telecommunications company, triggering a 27% surge in the MOTHER token’s price and potentially signaling a continuation of the recent uptrend. Iggy Azalea MOTHER Tokens Accepted For Phone Purchases In her social media post, Azalea revealed plans to resurrect a co-founded telecommunications company, allowing MOTHER and Solana (SOL) token holders to utilize their tokens for purchasing phones or monthly cell plans. Related Reading: Solana Searching For Direction: Will SOL Break Free Or Fall Flat? Azalea also revealed that technology company Sphere Labs will handle the payment infrastructure for these transactions, while Unreal Mobile will provide the phone services. Azalea mentioned that users will have access to a selection of phones for purchase. She also revealed that the company will have an advertising campaign and a launch later this week. Azalea further stated: Roll out campaign and advertising, etc. all begin and continue throughout the week so you’ll see me posting more of that. But don’t forget this is just a convenient side mission for me and not my main vision for what will drive mother. From Scam Threat To Crypto Vision According to a report from Fortune Magazine, the launch of Mother Iggy’s token was accidental and strategic. Azalea took action after discovering a scammer on Telegram using her name to launch a memecoin. Determined to combat this fraudulent activity, she launched her token within a shorter time frame. Per the report, Iggy Azalea has been observing the crypto industry since 2020 and recognized the potential in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Web3 art projects. Memecoins resonated with her as they aligned with her familiarity with viral content and memes throughout her career. Contrary to the negative perception surrounding celebrity-backed coins, Iggy Azalea emphasized her intention to establish long-term utility for the MOTHER token. The Australian singer sees the “celebrity buzz” as an opportunity for the retail industry to engage with the Solana blockchain. Related Reading: Major Bitcoin Metric Breaks 3-Month Downtrend Amid Bullish Network Recovery In addition to integrating with her phone data provider startup, Azalea intends to integrate MOTHER tokens as a gifting and crowdfunding platform.

The MOTHER token is currently trading at $0.1897, indicating a 20% decline from its record levels.

This surge, captured by Shibburn, a platform dedicated to tracking SHIB token burns, has sparked significant attention within the cryptocurrency community. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Could Skyrocket By 1,100%, Predicts Analyst Unprecedented Surge In Shiba Inu Burns – Details Shibburn’s latest data highlights a massive spike in SHIB burns, initiated by a collective effort from the Shiba Inu community. Over the past day, seven wallet addresses contributed to a burn of 7.6 million SHIB tokens, dramatically escalating the burn rate to approximately 68,316%. Notably, three transactions from these addresses were particularly significant, with one wallet identified as ‘0x60’, burning roughly 4.3 million SHIB alone. This wallet, responsible for the largest single transaction, also recorded another major burn, bringing its total to over 5 million Shiba Inu burned in the past day. The second wallet, identified as ‘0xc6,’ also contributed notably, burning 1.5 million SHIB tokens just an hour ago, although this was a smaller amount than the first. The substantial increase in burned tokens has pushed the total number of Shiba Inu removed from circulation to approximately 410.7 trillion, with the current circulating supply at 589.2 trillion. The continuous removal of Shiba Inu from circulation aims to create scarcity, potentially driving up the price in the long term, although the immediate effects on market price remain subdued. Market Challenges And SHIB’s Vision For DeFi Despite the significant burn activity, SHIB’s market price has not mirrored the enthusiasm in the burn metrics. Over the last 24 hours, SHIB’s price has declined by 0.5%, setting the price at $0.00002325. This decrease is part of a broader downward trend, with SHIB experiencing a nearly 6% fall over the past week. Amid these market activities, Lucie, the SHIB team’s social media marketing lead, shared insights on Elon Musk’s social media platform, X, earlier today about the potential for a SHIB-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). She expressed concerns about whether financial institutions would recognize the importance of SHIB for future financial planning. Lucie hoped for a broader understanding from major financial entities like BlackRock, emphasizing the “unique value” SHIB brings to the market. She also stressed the team’s commitment to their original vision and growth, highlighting their efforts to build something meaningful for the future of decentralized finance (DeFi).

29285338,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=612309,1718071235,Litecoin In Uphill Battle: Strong Resistance Might Block Recovery,"On-chain data suggests Litecoin potentially has a major amount of resistance waiting just ahead, making a recovery more difficult for LTC’s price. Litecoin Has A Large Supply Wall Waiting At Levels Just Ahead As pointed out by X user Trader Kamikaze using data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, a large amount of LTC investors bought at levels that are coming ahead. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could See Next Top At $89,200, Crypto Analyst Suggests Below is the IntoTheBlock chart that shows the distribution of LTC addresses based on the price at which they last bought their coins on the network. Here, the size of the dot correlates to the amount of cryptocurrency acquired in the corresponding price range. As is clearly visible, the $81.64 to $83.88 range has a large dot associated with it, meaning that a large number of tokens were bought while the asset traded within it. More specifically, 432,070 addresses bought around 6.67 million LTC inside this range. This amount is worth north of $534 million at the current exchange rate. Now, what relevance could this have for Litecoin? In on-chain analysis, the strength of any level as support or resistance comes down to how many coins were acquired at said level. As such, this thick LTC range with investors could potentially influence the cryptocurrency upon a retest. The reason behind this theory is that the cost basis is an important level for any holder, so they may be more prone to show some reaction when a retest of it takes place. The larger the number of investors who share their cost basis inside a narrow range, the stronger this reaction would be. What kind of reaction a retest would produce depends on whether it’s happening from above or below. Investors in losses just before the retest (that is, it’s taking place from below) might tend towards selling, as they could fear the price would go down again shortly. Exiting at the break-even mark would mean at least they can avoid realizing any losses. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Ethereum On “Path To Acceleration,” CryptoQuant Explains Why On the other hand, holders in the green leading up to the retest could decide to take a further gamble, believing that the price would go up again. Therefore, levels below the current price can be points of support, while those above resistance. As Litecoin has a notable supply wall at levels just ahead of the current one, it’s possible that a retest of it could produce a selling reaction. It now remains to be seen if this thick range would impede LTC’s recovery, should the cryptocurrency rise to retest it. LTC Price Litecoin is currently situated just below the supply above wall, as its price is trading around $80.

The analyst also outlined when this price target will be attained. XRP Will Hit $250 In This Market Cycle Steingraber mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that XRP will reach $250 by 2025, which he believes will represent the market top for the crypto token in this bull run. He made this prediction while stating that Bitcoin and Ethereum will hit $250,000 and $25,000 in 2025, which will also be their market top. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Gives Reasons Why A Face-Melting Bull Run Is On The Horizon Steingraber has previously provided several reasons why he is so bullish on XRP and believes the crypto token could attain such heights. He once alluded to a potential XRP ETF as one factor that could trigger significant price surges for XRP. He explained that an XRP ETF would give the crypto token an added utility as fund issuers for the XRP ETFs will direct their assets into an institutional liquidity hub. He believes an XRP ETF will drive more demand for the crypto token, ultimately driving up its price when a supply shock occurs. Steingraber also believes that the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple is one of the factors suppressing XRP’s price up until now. He had earlier claimed that XRP’s price wasn’t going up because new money wasn’t flowing into its ecosystem and affirmed that the crypto token would likely see an influx of new money once the SEC’s case against Ripple is over. Steingraber isn’t the only one who believes that XRP’s price could skyrocket and climb to three figures once the lawsuit ends. Crypto analyst JackTheRippler also predicted that XRP would rise above $100 once the case ends. The analyst even gave a more bullish prediction than Steingraber’s, stating that XRP hitting $10,000 was achievable after the lawsuit. Crypto analyst CryptoBull also predicted that XRP could reach three figures, rallying 28,900% to $154. XRP Price To $7.5 In The Meantime Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has suggested that XRP rising to $7.5 is the price target to watch before the crypto token reaches the heights analysts like Steingraber predict. In an X post, he stated that “$7.5 is target number 1.” Egrag went on to outline how this move to $7.5 will likely take place. Related Reading: Litecoin Sees Massive 75% Surge In Major Metric – Can This Trigger A Rally To $200? He stated he is highly convinced that XRP will break the white triangle (on the chart he shared) and hit the measured move at $1.5. From there, he expects XRP to make its move to $7.5. However, he warned that the Fib 1.618 zone where $7.5 is situated is “critical” and that a lot of profit-taking will happen there, suggesting that XRP could significantly decline once it reaches such heights. Egrag added that the next targets for XRP will be “mid-double digits near Fib 2.414 & 2.618” if XRP archives a weekly close above Fib 1.618.

The news received mixed reactions from the community, which worries about an incoming dump amid the recent retrace of the crypto market. Related Reading: Ready To Strike? Bitcoin Poised For A Big Move After Major Consolidation Whale Deposits $21 Million In DeFi Tokens To Binance On Monday, on-chain analytic firm Spotonchain reported a dormant whale had deposited around $13 million in crypto to Binance. After a year of holding, The whale sent 3,800 Maker (MKR) and 20,000 Aave (AAVE) to Binance. The firm later revealed that the whale was seemingly Tron founder Justin Sun. Three of the 13 addresses believed to be owned by Sun were wallets that conducted the transfers. Per the post, the whale deposited $21 million worth of 4 DeFi tokens to Binance in 30 minutes. The addresses sent 93,979 AAVE, worth around $11.26 million, and 3,800 MKR tokens. The addresses purchased the MKR tokens in June 2023 for $2.43 million, acquiring the 3,800 tokens at an average price of $641.81. Meanwhile, the AAVE tokens were bought from June 2023 until January 2024 at an average price of $87.14. At the time of the post, the crypto whale had around $7 million in estimated profits, $6.74 million from MKR, and $252,000 from AAVE. Additionally, Sun sent over 4,000 and 200,000 Compound (COMP) and Liquity (LQTY) tokens to the exchange. The transactions account for 4,178 COMP, worth around $245,000, and 203,823 LQTY, worth approximately $217,000. Are Sun’s Transfers Bearish Or Bullish? The deposits raised concerns among the crypto community as deposits on exchanges are considered bearish and could significantly decrease a token’s price if dumped. Nonetheless, some considered Sun’s movements as a bullish signal. An X user stated his optimism, claiming that whales “always deposit during the consolidation before the breakout.” Similarly, other crypto investors believe it’s “time to load up on DeFi” and that “Justin is about to give us generational entry.” It’s worth noting that the community closely follows Tron’s founder’s on-chain movements. As reported by NewsBTC, Sun is suspected to be the whale behind some of the massive Ethereum (ETH) purchases from Q1 2024. Sun seemingly bought over $891 million worth of ETH during the buying spree. Despite the community’s reaction, the 4 DeFi tokens sent to Binance didn’t react significantly to the transactions. After the news, AAVE saw a mild 1.4% drop to the $91.26 level before recovering the $92 support zone. The token saw a 12.4% drop on Friday following the recent market downturn.
