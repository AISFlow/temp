42430027,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM3Khh,1544474708,UNICEF Funds 6 Blockchain Startups to 'Solve Global Challenges',"The United Nations' charity arm for children, UNICEF, is funding research into blockchain tech.  Announced Monday  , UNICEF is investing $100,000 in six blockchain startups to ""solve global challenges using blockchain technology,"" ranging from healthcare delivery transparency to managing finances and resources.  The investments are part of a broader program which already funds 20 technology startups, according to a press release.  These are UNICEF's latest investments in blockchain startups through its innovation fund, which first hinted at the move as far back as February 2016, and put out a call for firms in the space explicitly at the beginning of this year.  Each of these startups is based in a developing economy, with firms based out of Argentina, Mexico, India, Tunisia and Bangladesh.  The six recipients are Atix Labs and Onesmart, which are developing platforms for tracking finances; Prescrypto, which is building a platform to track patient histories; Statwig, which is working to ensure vaccine delivery with a supply chain platform; Utopixar, which is working on a social collaboration tool; and W3 Engineers, which is looking to develop an offline networking system that does not require internet access.  UNICEF Innovation principal advisor Chris Fabian explained in a statement that the fund invests in projects ""when our financing, technical support, and focus on vulnerable populations can help a technology grow and mature in the most fair and equitable way possible.""  He added:  ""Blockchain technology is still at an early stage – and there is a great deal of experimentation, failure, and learning ahead of us as we see how, and where, we can use this technology to create a better world.""  On top of the funding, UNICEF will provide assistance with the products and technology, as well as share access to its network of partners and experts.  The companies are expected to deliver open-source prototypes of their projects over the next 12 months.  UNICEF has been looking into blockchain for years, investing in an identity-focused startup two years ago and trialing smart contracts for transactions.

42430025,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM3Kbh,1544468714,State Farm Trials Blockchain Tool for Streamlining Insurance Claims,"U.S. insurance group State Farm is testing blockchain tech as part of a new platform for insurance subrogation.  State Farm announced Monday that it was trialing a blockchain solution to streamline the manual process of subrogation. Subrogation is the legal right for companies to pursue damages from a third-party responsible for causing a loss to the insured party.  The trial is currently aimed at determining whether a blockchain platform is a “viable product for insurance industry adoption,” according to a press statement. State Farm is a notable entry on the list of firms testing blockchain, having ranked 36 on the Fortune 500 list for 2018.  State Farm explained that during an auto claim, two insurance firms would determine the claim amount. The insurer for the party at-fault for damages would pay the insurer for the other party.  Some $11 billion in claims were transferred due to subrogation in 2017, a spokesperson for State Farm explained in an email, with $750 million dealing with private-passenger insurance claims.  “Today, subrogation is a relatively manual, time-consuming process often requiring physical checks to be mailed on a claim-by-claim basis between insurers,"" State Farm innovation executive Mike Fields explained in a statement. By contrast, using a blockchain platform would provide a number of benefits, he said, adding:  “It helps us automate a manual process securely and creates a permanent transaction record of each payment which can easily be verified for accuracy. It also has the potential to decrease the amount of time for consumers to receive their deductible reimbursement.”  In an email, the State Farm spokesperson added that the blockchain solution may reduce the risk of an error in processing a claim due to the way the platform’s validation process. It would also decrease the number of paper checks sent from one insurer to another.  Innovation manager Dustin Helland added that the team was looking at the immutability of a blockchain as another benefit from the technology.  The test will run through the first half of 2019, alongside existing subrogation processes. Helland added that ""the results of the test, along with other factors, will be input for a decision on whether or not to launch the solution into full production adoption.""

42430035,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM3Klh,1544459123,Bitcoin's Share of the Crypto Market Is Nearing a 3-Month High,"Bitcoin’s share of the cryptocurrency market hit an 11-week high on Thursday, market data shows.  Data from CoinMarketCap reveals that bitcoin’s dominance rate reached 55.38 percent on Dec. 6, which is its highest level recorded since Sept. 20. At press time, that figure is hovering around 55.1 percent.  The dominance rate is a metric used to measure the percent market share of a particular asset in cryptocurrency market. What the development suggests is that traders may be shifting funds from alternative cryptocurrencies into the world's largest coin by market capitalization – or at the very least, demand for bitcoin is outpacing other networks.  Bitcoin has always maintained the largest share of the cryptocurrency market, even when its dominance rate hit an all time low of 32 percent on Jan. 13 of this year.  At the time, the alternative cryptocurrency market (or the crypto market excluding bitcoin) had seen its total capitalization increased nearly 24,000 percent over the course of the prior year, which ate away a considerable amount of bitcoin's overall market share.  Since then, the alternative cryptocurrency market has depreciated more than 90 percent in terms of total capitalization from its record high of $550 billion.  Bitcoin's price has struggled to retain its value, too, haven fallen over 80 percent since its all-time high was recorded in December 2017. Yet it's still clearly the preferred cryptocurrency even in a risk-off market, where mitigating risk is a top priority – a claim shored up by its rising dominance rate.

In a speech last week, focused on reviewing the SEC's progress in 2018 and discussing the agenda for 2019, Clayton said ""I believe that ICOs can be effective ways for entrepreneurs and others to raise capital.""  However, he added that securities rules must be adhered to where appropriate.  ""The novel technological nature of an ICO does not change the fundamental point that, when a security is being offered, our securities laws must be followed,"" he said.  The chairman further said that the SEC and its staff ""have spent a significant amount of time"" focusing on blockchain and cypto assets and that is a trend he expects to continue in the coming year.  Clayton continued:  ""A number of concerns have been raised regarding the digital assets and ICO markets, including that, as they are currently operating, there is substantially less investor protection than in the traditional equities and fixed income markets, with correspondingly greater opportunities for fraud and manipulation.""  This is not the first time the SEC chief has addressed the issue of potential crypto market manipulation. Speaking at the recent CoinDesk Consensus: Invest conference, he said, ""The prices retail investors are seeing are the prices they should rely on, and free from manipulation – not free from volatility, but free from manipulation.""  U.S. congressmen also introduced two bipartisan bills last week in order to prevent price manipulation in the crypto markets. The bills essentially ask the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and other financial watchdogs to come up with a roadmap for better crypto regulation so as to protect investors, as well as to boost the role of the U.S. as a fintech innovator.  In his speech, Clayton also spoke of the SEC's recently launched Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology (FinHub), aimed at making it simpler for fintech startups, including those working with crypto assets, to navigate the legal implications of their products.  ""As the FinHub and our other activities demonstrate, our door remains open to those who seek to innovate and raise capital in accordance with the law,"" he said.

42430021,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM3KNh,1544450449,Crypto Trading Platform ErisX Hires Serial Exchange Founder Matt Trudeau,"ErisX is beefing up its leadership ahead of the launch of cryptocurrency spot and futures trading early next year.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the digital asset trading platform has hired markets and exchanges veteran Matt Trudeau as chief strategy officer. The news comes a week after ErisX closed a Series B funding round that raised $27.5 million from firms such as Bitmain, ConsenSys, Fidelity Investments, Nasdaq Ventures and Monex Group.  Trudeau started his trading career in the early 2000s when the U.S. equities market was going digital and has overseen some 10 global market launches including Instinet, Chi-X, IEX and most recently Tradewind, where he looked specifically at how to tokenize and trade precious metals.  Outside of crypto and financial circles, he is best known as one of the heroes of Michael Lewis' bestseller ""Flash Boys,"" which tells the story of IEX, a stock exchange founded to promote fairer markets by creating speed bumps for high-frequency trading.  “I have seen first hand the difference between market revolutions and more incremental evolutions,” Trudeau told CoinDesk. “Clearly, crypto markets were a bit of revolution at the outset and now it feels more like we are at a stage where it needs to be more evolutionary.”  In his new role, Trudeau is tasked with thinking about the long term, beyond the current bear market conditions in crypto.  “There is the tactical trading aspects of what's going on in the market right now. But you need to take the long view. Some of best internet businesses were started after the dotcom crash,” he said.  Thomas Chippas, CEO of ErisX, agreed and added:  “Would it be better if the price of crypto were generally going up? Of course it would. But stocks have been volatile recently too, if we were talking about equities and a stock exchange, nobody is going to say, 'are you going to open your doors tomorrow?'”  Futures and spot markets  Backed by a range of large trading firms such as DRW and TD Ameritrade, as well as crypto specialists such as ConsenSys, ErisX aims to launch spot trading in bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, and ethereum by Q2 2019. Futures contracts in bitcoin (and possibly other coins) will follow shortly after, subject to approval by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  Unlike the bitcoin futures that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board Options Exchange (also a backer of ErisX) have been offering for almost a year now, ErisX's contracts will be settled in actual bitcoin, rather than in cash.  But ErisX won't be alone in listing so-called physically settled contracts, as New York Stock Exchange parent ICE is poised to offer one-day physically settled bitcoin futures on its Bakkt platform in January.  As far as futures in other coins appearing on the platform, Chippas said: “Everything here is going to be subject to approval. But we are working with the commission [CFTC] during our application phase here and will say more about which products would launch thereafter.”  Like many other firms building institutional-grade crypto offerings, ErisX is in the process of securing a range of regulatory licenses. It is in the process of gaining a Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO) license from the CFTC, while on the spot side, the team has been gathering state-based money transmitter licenses.  “You have to go state by state and the laws are slightly different in each state, so you have to make a state-level application. We already have a substantial number and we have others in flight,” said Chippas.  Trudeau added that what ErisX is doing with the spot market and futures fits more neatly into some of the pre-existing constructs, as opposed to things like alternative trading system (ATS) licenses from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for crypto firms.  “If you are introducing something regulators haven't had an opportunity to really look at and study, they are going to take their time and learn,” said Trudeau, with regard to the SEC. “I think with what we are seeing in the market with ATS's and securities tokens is that some of those things are less crisply defined at this point so they require a bit more study.”  Matt Trudeau image via LendIt Conference/YouTube",POSITIVE,없음,BCH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/12/10/crypto-trading-platform-erisx-hires-serial-exchange-founder-matt-trudeau,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/deaa8305da03463b337a405ef4223d28f0c2e30a-1500x926.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Cryptocurrency mining giant Bitmain is closing down its Israel-based research and development arm.    According to a report from financial news source Globes, Bitmaintech Israel, the firm’s R&D center in the city of Ra'anana, is being shuttered due to the general downturn in the crypto markets.  All 23 employees, including Bitmain’s vice president for sales and marketing Gadi Glikberg – who led the Israeli project – have been laid off. Only a few months ago, the firm had reportedly been planning to hire over 40 people at the center across research, engineering and marketing roles.  ""The crypto market has undergone a shake-up in the past few months, which has forced Bitmain to examine its various activities around the globe and to refocus its business in accordance with the current situation,” Glikberg reportedly told local employees.  BitmainTech Israel was launched back in 2016, and went on to launch Bitmain's ConnectBTC mining pool in April 2017. The unit worked on developing blockchain technology, as well as artificial intelligence for the company's Sophon project.  A Bitmain spokesperson told CoinDesk:  “As part of the normal course of business, we are continually evaluating our market strategy to gain efficiencies and take advantage of growth opportunities. As a result, we have decided to close our operations in Israel at this time and remain on the lookout for the best talent in the world for our operations across the globe.""  The extended bear market for cryptocurrencies has led to layoffs at other firms too. Just last week, ConsenSys, the ethereum production studio, axed 13 percent of its staff as it reset its priorities. And last month, blockchain startup Steemit laid off close to 70 percent of its staff as fiat returns could no longer adequately cover the growing costs of running full Steem nodes.

The social media giant now has five job openings for blockchain talent at its Menlo Park, California, headquarters in the areas of data science, software engineering and marketing.  While the firm's possible plans for blockchain have not yet been revealed, the ads on its careers pages state that the ultimate goal is to help “billions of people with access to things they don't have now.” It further cites “equitable financial services, new ways to save, or new ways to share information” as some potential use cases for the tech.  Facebook launched its blockchain team in May, with the reported aim of exploring the emerging technology. The team is headed by David Marcus, who had previously served as the company’s vice president of its Messenger app division. In June, the firm appointed one of its senior engineers, Evan Cheng, as its first “director of engineering, blockchain.”  In the ads, Facebook said that the blockchain division has been set up as a startup within the firm, and has the aim of making blockchain technology work at scale within the company.  For its data-focused roles, there are openings for a data scientist and a data engineer, with some of the requirements being described as quantitative analysis expertise, ""informing solutions with a variety of data,"" making product decisions and ""building models of user behaviors for analysis or to power production systems.""  Facebook is also looking for two blockchain software engineers ""who share a passion for tackling complexity and building platforms that can scale through multiple orders of magnitude,” one post reads.

42402302,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3yPO,1544439621,$3K Ahead? Bitcoin Price Bounce Is Again Losing Steam,"Bitcoin (BTC) still has the potential to drop towards $3,000, despite a minor bounce from 15-month lows seen on Friday.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value picked up a bid at $3,210 three days ago – a level last seen in September 2017. The ensuing corrective bounce, however, seems to have run out of steam, as bitcoin is currently trading at $3,470 on Bitstamp – down 4 percent from yesterday's high of $3,633.  It's worth noting that prices are currently down more than 80 percent from the record high of $20,000 reached last December. Further, BTC has depreciated close to 47 percent in the last month, forming record oversold conditions.  Even so, BTC is struggling to post a notable price bounce, which indicates bearish sentiment is still strong.  As a result, the cryptocurrency is likely to remain on the defensive in the short-term, at least. Notably, the 3-day chart, which can offer a better picture of the broader market trend than the daily and intra-day charts, is indicating room for a drop below the psychological support of $3,000.  3-day chart  As seen above, the previous three-day candle closed below support at $3,463 (low of multiple three-day candles in September 2017), validating both the recent high-volume sell-off from $6,200 and the bearish lower-high pattern carved out along the downward sloping 5-candle moving average (MA) over the last few days.  Further, both the recent ""death cross"" crossover between the 50- and 200-candle MAs and the steeply descending 10-candle MA are indicating a bearish setup.  As a result, BTC has potential to test $2,972 (September 2017 low) in the near-term.  4-hour chart  Over on the 4-hour chart, BTC is struggling to cut through the descending trendline hurdle (marked in yellow), currently at $3,540. A break above that level could yield a stronger corrective rally to $3,800 (falling trendline hurdle).  The RSI, however, has already dived out of the ascending trendline, signaling bearish conditions. BTC, therefore, may have a tough time clearing the immediate resistance at $3,540.  View  BTC risks falling to $2,972 (September 2017 low) in the near-term, according to the 3-day chart.  Prices could rise to $3,800 if resistance at $3,540 is cleared in the next few hours. The bearish outlook, however, would only be invalidated if the descending 10-candle MA on the 3-day chart, currently at $4,250, is scaled.

42402301,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3yNQ,1544436034,Vertcoin’s Struggle Is Real: Why the Latest Crypto 51% Attack Matters,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.    -------    You may not have heard of Vertcoin, a crypto project designed to curtail concentration in mining power in the interests of broad-based participation. But if you care about security, decentralization and open access for cryptocurrencies, then the questions raised by a recent breach of its blockchain will matter to you.  In a textbook 51 percent attack documented in a blog post by Coinbase security engineer Mark Nesbitt, someone seized majority control of the Vertcoin network’s hashing power to conduct multiple “reorgs” of the blockchain. The attacker essentially rewrote part of the ledger’s history and then, using their dominant hashing power to produce the longest chain, convinced the rest of the miners to validate this new version of the blockchain. With that, he or she could commit the ultimate crypto crime: a double-spend of prior transactions, leaving earlier payees holding invalidated coins.  It was a painful blow for Vertcoin’s passionate community of users. Led by a dedicated, decentralized team of developers – the antithesis of last year’s money-grabbing ICO issuers – for four years they have defended their “ASIC-resistant” algorithm as a way to avoid the industrialized concentration of bitcoin and other proof-of-work cryptocurrencies.  Now, the bear market in cryptocurrencies has posed them with a challenging question: was their constant commitment to maintaining the competitiveness of affordable, general-purpose mining equipment worth it? Is their otherwise laudable goal of democratized mining only creating an untenable security risk?  Not surprisingly, critics, including many bitcoin maximalists, see the affair as a nail in the coffin for Vertcoin and other such projects. These ASIC-resistant projects’ algorithms are designed to ensure that powerful rigs running expensive, uniquely designed application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) have no advantage over those with graphics cards, or GPUs, a widely available, more affordable processing unit that can also be used for gaming consoles and other purposes.  The problem, these critics say, is that if mining is relatively cheap and can be employed by simply taking a machine that’s currently doing one thing and having it do a different task, it’s easy for an attacker to deploy enough hashing power to seize control of the network. As a Breaker Mag headline declared, “Vertcoin’s greatest strength” seems now to be “a fatal flaw.”  There’s still a case for ASIC resistance  Yet there’s still no slam-dunk argument in favor of ASIC-dominated cryptocurrencies.  By any measure, concentrated, ASIC-led mining power has fostered centralization around a few big players, which not only raises the risk of 51 percent attacks by any of those large operators on their own or in collusion but also puts them in a role as de facto gatekeepers. That violates the anti-middleman objectives of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology generally.  Look at how Bitmain has, with varying success, periodically used its position as the dominant provider of bitcoin mining hardware to manipulate the market and force its interests on the wider community. While it’s true that Bitmain has at times been thwarted by its opponents, notably by developers who successfully introduced the Segregated Witness (SegWit) update to bitcoin’s code against its wishes, there’s an argument that this only put users at the mercy of a different kind of gatekeeper group: the Bitcoin Core developers.  The arms race unleashed by ASIC-based competition for block rewards has also resulted in massive energy consumption in proof-of-work cryptocurrencies. While I believe bitcoin’s threat to the planet is way overblown and am encouraged by a recent Coinshares calculation that 77.6 percent of bitcoin mining uses renewable power, there’s no denying that electricity usage remains both an environmental challenge and a serious public relations problem for this industry.  What’s more, it’s not clear that ASIC mining models are immune from the root cause of Vertcoin’s problems. Essentially, falling coin prices made mining less profitable and resulted in lower rental rates for already-installed hardware on cloud mining sites such as Nicehash. It was that rented capacity, not newly deployed machines, that gave the attacker a quick, low-cost route to amassing hashing power.  All cryptocurrencies, both ASIC-resistant and ASIC-allowing versions, have seen their mining rental rates fall as crypto asset markets have collapsed. That has put a big pool of installed ASIC capacity at attackers’ disposal, undermining the argument that ASIC coins are protected because their rigs are more expensive to acquire and deploy than general-purpose GPUs.  It’s true that if there’s not enough rented hashing power to reach 51 percent, then an attacker will face a bigger barrier if they must deploy new ASICs to get there. But if the attacker is already a large-scale ASIC miner, that’s not necessarily a big leap, either.  Some developers are seeing the Vertcoin experience as a warning for all cryptocurrencies, viewing this bear market, which is playing havoc with mining profitability, as an all-encompassing threat to consensus models.  Even before the worst of the downturn, 51 percent attacks seemed to be becoming more common. In comments to a Twitter thread he started regarding Nesbitt’s blog post, zcash developer Zooko Wilcox suggested the threat was quite wide indeed:  To be sure, bitcoin appears to be significantly less vulnerable than other coins, because its massive overall hashing power, though itself down sharply since early October, makes it extremely expensive to rent enough of that power to take over the network.  In contrast with a mere $131 per hourhttps://www.crypto51.app/coins/VTC.html cost for a 51 percent attack on Vertcoin as of Friday, a bitcoin attack would have cost you $226,000 per hour, according to the website Crypto51. And that doesn’t take into account the fact that the current list of cloud mining providers could never deliver enough hashing power for a renter to grab majority control of the network.  Also, if bottom-fishers eventually stabilize bitcoin’s price, which is now down more than 80 percent over the past 12 months, it will allow the protocol’s in-built difficulty adjustment to catch up and start to restore mining profitability.  Still, this case for bitcoin’s superior security stems from its status as the dominant coin, not from the presence of ASICs per se. And it unreasonably assumes no further improvements in the various models aimed at achieving alternative consensus and governance models.  We are by no means in stasis. Developers, within both altcoin and bitcoin communities, continue to explore decentralizing solutions. And for very good reason: the purpose of this technology has always been to achieve peer-to-peer exchange with broad, permissionless access that no gatekeeper can control.  The way the Vertcoin community has approached that objective deserves recognition. It combines an anti-ASIC algorithm with a clear, community-wide pact to fork the code whenever an ASIC chip is designed to mine its coin.  The model brings together two design elements that are critical for this technology’s success: smart on-chain cryptography with a clear off-chain social governance structure. (Disclosure: two of the main developers at Vertcoin, James Lovejoy and Gert-Jaap Glasbergen, are researchers at the MIT Digital Currency Initiative, where I am a senior advisor.)  Fighting the good fight  Still, this latest attack is a reminder that this cat-and-mouse game between the community and prospective attackers is really difficult to manage. The recent incursion into the Vertcoin network by specially designed Vertcoin ASICs showed how hard it is to keep up with the threat being amassed against it.  But in the spirit of learning from failure, Vertcoin’s developers are now making fixes that will improve their cryptocurrency’s security. One protocol update will make the new Vertcoin ASICs uncompetitive, for example.  It isn’t clear whether these are enough to offset the loss of confidence among Vertcoin investors and exchanges, which were the biggest losers in the double-spend attack. Vertcoin’s price has been hammered. From a peak of $10 in January, it was near $0.24 on Friday. And it is down 64 percent since the beginning of November alone. It may never recover from the blow to its reputation.  But what Vertcoin developers are trying to achieve is important. It would be a mistake to dismiss their work based on this latest development.  Whether this cryptocurrency itself survives or the learnings that come from it are applied to some other project, work on models that encourage open access and decentralization should be allowed to continue.

42402289,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3yEZ,1544432443,Japanese Lawmaker Proposes 4 Changes to Ease Crypto Tax Burden,"A Japanese lawmaker has proposed a number of changes to the current taxation regime in order to ease the burden for cryptocurrency users and encourage adoption of cryptocurrencies in the country.  In a meeting held earlier this month, Takeshi Fujimaki, a representative of the third-largest opposition political party Nippon Ishin, said that the country's tax system should not ""crush the future"" of digital currencies and blockchain technology, and recommended four amendments ""to promote the wider [spread] of virtual currency into society.""  Firstly, Takeshi suggested that there should be a separate tax rate of 20 percent on crypto gains instead of current up to 55-percent rate because gains from cryptocurrency trades are not stable like salary income and there are chances of incurring losses. Accordingly, gains from cryptos should be taxed on par with other investment options in the country, such as stocks and mutual funds, he said.  Secondly, the lawmaker recommended that it should be permissible to carry forward losses from cryptocurrencies in order to have a ""fair"" system.  Currently, if you make a loss in one year and profit in the next from cryptos, you still need to pay tax on the gains that you made in the second year with no allowance for the previous loss. However, in the case of other investment types, such as stocks and property, Takeshi said, taxpayers can deduct losses from the total profit and pay tax on the difference.  In his third point, the politician said that there should be a tax exemption for trading between two virtual currencies. For instance, presently when you trade between, say bitcoin and XRP, you need to pay taxes if you made a profit.  “In order to increase the volume of transactions between virtual currencies and to revitalize the virtual currency market, trading between virtual currencies should be tax exempt,” Takeshi said, adding that the calculation of profits or losses for such transactions is complex and “extremely cumbersome.”  Lastly, he said that in order to increase small payments in virtual currencies, there should be a tax exemption in that area too. For example, currently, when a person pays at a restaurant with bitcoin, they'd need to pay tax on the profit at conversation from fiat to crypto, if any.  However, this may hinder the use of cryptos for payments, Takeshi argued, saying:  “If you do everything like this, you can not hope for penetration of virtual currency settlement in real society. The small amount of virtual currency settlement should be tax exempt, and the virtual currency settlement in the real world should be expanded.”  This is not the first time Takeshi has raised the issue of crypto taxation. Back in June, he suggested changing Japan’s tax policy on cryptocurrency profits from its current “miscellaneous income” classification to “separate declared taxation.” However, Japan’s deputy prime minister pushed back against that suggestion at the time, indicating he was “doubtful” that the general public would understand such a change.  In October, the country’s Tax Commission was also looking for ways to simplify the current tax filing system for cryptocurrencies in order to ensure investors accurately report their gains.

42402287,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3yAd,1544418019,Stablecoin Issuer Promises Full Audits of Euro-Backed Crypto Token,"Stasis, a Malta-based issuer of stablecoins, has hired accounting firm BDO Malta to conduct quarterly and annual audits of its financials, including the euro reserves backing the startup's EURS token.  The engagement aims to dispel any doubts that EURS stablecoins are backed one-to-one by euros. Many cryptocurrency investors and traders will be wary of any such claim by a stablecoin issuer, due to nagging questions around the dominant issuer, Tether.  Tether's USDT tokens lost their parity with the U.S. dollar in a dramatic fashion in October, due to widespread doubts that the company held one U.S. dollar in bank deposits for every token in circulation.  More than a year ago, Tether reiterated its promise of regular audits to prove it held sufficient fiat collateral, but so far it has still not delivered. Rather it severed ties with the auditing firm Friedman LLP in January and instead produced documents prepared by a law firm in June and its bank in November, which vouch for the existence of sufficient deposits.  Apparently alluding to the controversy surrounding Tether, Stasis CFO Vyacheslav Kim said in a statement last week:  ""The recent conversation around stablecoins has hinged on two things: compliance and transparency. By providing verification by a top accounting firm, in addition to EURS' existing regulatory compliance under Maltese law, we've established EURS as a standout option for European investors.""  In addition to the audits, BDO Malta – a member of the BDO International network of accounting firms, which operates out of more than 160 countries according to its website – will ""provide weekly cash reserve verification"" of the fiat collateral behind EURS, Stasis said. The first such report was published Thursday. It makes clear that the document does not constitute an audit.  Stablecoin issuance is an increasingly crowded and competitive corner of the cryptocurrency sector, and a number of providers are aiming to reassure a skeptical market by publicizing their relationships with prominent accounting firms.  Within the past month Circle, which provides the dollar-linked USDC, has published an attestation of its dollar collateral prepared by Grant Thornton LLP; Gemini, which issues the USD-pegged Gemini Dollar, has done the same with an attestation from BPM; and Paxos, issuer of the dollar-linked Paxos Standard, has published an attestation from Withum.  Audits > attestations  Yet Stasis stands out by promising full audits.  Michael Shaub, who teaches auditing and accounting ethics at Texas A&M University, told CoinDesk that ""I would take much more heart"" from a full audit of a stablecoin provider's financials, as opposed to a verification or attestation.  Explaining the differences between verifications, attestations and audits, Shaub said that an audit ""is applied broadly to the financial statements"" – including income statements, cash flow statements and balance sheets – while an attestation (of the sort Circle, Gemini and Paxos publish) ""is limited to some narrow representation,"" for example, that the requisite bank deposits existed at a moment in time.  ""The level of assurance is very similar,"" he said, but an audit provides important context that goes beyond an isolated snapshot: ""You can reach more of a conclusion of, is that money likely to be in the bank tomorrow? Was it in the bank yesterday?""  A verification, meanwhile, provides far less context, and does not necessarily have to be prepared by a qualified accountant. Tether, as noted above, published a verification prepared by its law firm.  In a verification, the firm in question and its accountant (or lawyer) decide on a procedure, and the accountant carries it out as agreed; that contrasts with the rigorous standards an attestation or audit requires.  For example, Shaub noted, a verification does not necessarily indicate that the bank deposits aren't simply a one-time loan, or being shuffled around between accounts.  Hard to get?  Stasis' promised audits – the first is expected in Q1 2019 – are all the more notable since some issuers, and not just Tether, have claimed that audits are currently unobtainable in the stablecoin market.  Cameron Winklevoss, Gemini's co-founder and president, said on Twitter in October that ""there is no financial report framework [with respect to] to audit conformity [with] a stablecoin. So you can't perform an 'audit.'""  Instead, he continued, issuers must ""rely on a 3rd party to attest to whether an assertion (that there is a 1:1 peg) is accurate.""  Even so, according to a Stasis spokesperson, ""BDO Malta will perform full audits once a quarter, plus verifications every week.""  When contacted by CoinDesk, Sam Spiridonov, the audit partner at BDO Malta who signed Stasis' first weekly verification, said the ""audit will cover all the financial statements of STSS (Malta) Limited, including the euro deposits.""  In the meantime, Tether continues to dominate the stablecoin market, despite the controversy surrounding it.  With a market capitalization of nearly $1.9 billion, USDT is the seventh-most valuable cryptocurrency overall. Stasis' EURS, by contrast, ranks 82nd, with a market cap of just $35 million, according to CoinMarketCap.
