42426013,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhpLh,1409784351,CheapAir Now Accepts Litecoin and Dogecoin for Flight Bookings,"CheapAir.com has announced that it will now accept dogecoin and litecoin as payment for flight and railway bookings.  The online travel booking website began accepting bitcoin for flight bookings in November, and subsequently expanded its bitcoin payment service to include hotel and railway bookings. Since adding bitcoin as a payment option, CheapAir has seen a positive response from its customers, recently announcing that it had passed $1.5m in total bitcoin sales.  Speaking to CoinDesk, CEO Jeff Klee said that the decision was encouraged by grassroots support from its customer base, noting that the same demographics that made its bitcoin integration a success inspired the company's latest move in the digital currency space.  Klee explained:  “We’ve had some success with bitcoin, we’ve gotten some new customers there – enthusiastic customers. We’ve gotten a great response since we began accepting [bitcoin], and we had some requests for dogecoin and litecoin. We figured why not?”  Notably, GoCoin will serve as the company's altcoin payments processor, enabling the company to accept litecoin and dogecoin in addition to bitcoin. CheapAir will continue to accept bitcoin through its existing partnership with Coinbase.  Altcoin strategy  Klee told CoinDesk that CheapAir will utilize the same deployment strategy for dogecoin and litecoin as it did for bitcoin. This means offering altcoin support for plane and train ticket purchases and, pending on the success of the initiative, expanding from there.  Klee stated:  “It’s the same pattern we went through with bitcoin. We launched it first for flights, and, assuming that goes well, we’ll roll out [altcoin support] for hotels pretty quickly, too.”  CheapAir is also extending its stable price guarantee to dogecoin and litecoin customers, offering $100 – in dollars – to those who see the price of a fare fall after they buy a ticket.  Klee said that the company is working to streamline its existing system for this service, adding that it helps customers who may see some volatility in the value of their coins.

42426006,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhpTh,1409772047,Why New Forms of Spam Could Bloat Bitcoin's Block Chain,"New technologies bring the promise of exciting new services, but they also encourage those looking to make a quick buck at the expense of others.  Email is a prime example of this. When the Internet began its rise to popularity in the 1990s, it was obvious the technology could be utilized to provide an easier way for people to communicate.  However, email's no-cost model enticed many people who saw it as a cheap advertising medium, quickly creating a plague of annoying spam messages that advertised often-undesirable products.  More recently, bitcoin's public ledger, the block chain, has been recognised for its potential to serve as a low-cost means of recording cryptocurrency transactions and also other types of digital information.  Some, though, fear that unscrupulous actors will leverage this feature to turn the block chain into a cheap place to publish new types of spam, and that it could become 'bloated' as a result – in effect, overloaded with data that has nothing to do with its primary purpose.  Dogecoin co-founder Jackson Palmer sees the issue as a potential problem:  “I believe that it's a big waste of resources to bloat a public ledger with information that's irrelevant to that specific ledgers purpose. If the ledger's purpose is to facilitate high-speed, transparent transactions online, then that should remain the sole purpose of that particular ledger.”  Junk in the block chain  The block chain’s ability to use cryptographic hashes as a permanent and public way to record and store information is impressive.  This, in turn, has attracted the efforts of projects such as Monegraph and Proof of Existence, which provide software to help people hash things such as art or software to prove authorship of the works.  Now there is concern that, while the above concepts are being created to utilize the block chain in a positive way, others might try to use it as a wasteful advertising method.  Marcell Ortutay, a developer who has built an open-source bitcoin microtransactions platform called Coinwall, thinks that some efforts to exploit the block chain may go too far:  “I remember on Valentine's Day this year, someone made a cute site at thenoteblock.com. The idea is to embed messages into the block chain, encoded in the transaction output addresses.”  While that website's ability to hash messages to significant others is an interesting experimental use case, the application of such probably doesn’t justify merit on the bitcoin block chain.  Technical solutions  Ortutay dismisses sites like thenoteblock as a problem that will just go away on its own: “No special action is needed to prevent these messages; they will stop once demand dries up,” he said.  In fact, some kind of protection is built in to the bitcoin system too. One effort made known on Reddit regarding the sending of 0.00000001 BTC to addresses advertising a bitcoin gambling service did not receive confirmations from the network because miners received no fees.  What may be considered more problematic are tokens that use the bitcoin block chain to gain some measure of legitimacy, and some people already consider these tokens as a form of spam.  “Most controversial [are] things like Counterparty and Mastercoin”, said Coinwall’s Ortutay. “They try to use the block chain as a datastore for various protocols, where things like bids/asks are embedded in bitcoin transactions.”  Scott Li, a co-founder of block chain API company Hello, block!, agrees:  “Mastercoin and Counterparty, especially, uses hacky ways to insert data into the block chain and [this] is seen as spammy.”  Changes are afoot, however, and the ability to store data in the block chain was actually reduced by the bitcoin core developers earlier this year with the release of the Bitcoin Core version 0.9.0.  Li says experimentation into these types of data storage concepts could be tested via side chains – linked 'shards', or copies, of the block chain that provide the same functionality, but avoid inundating bitcoin's only public ledger.  “I'm optimistic about side chains, which could be a clean experimentation ground for ‘bitcoin 2.0’ protocols and remove the spam,” said Li.  Applying disincentives  Bitcoin, in particular, has a system in place that discourages people from spamming the block chain. Attacks can be carried out via a variety of methods, including one known as a 'dust attack', in which the many transactions sent are so small that miners have no incentive to hash.  Bitcoin's transaction fees were actually lowered earlier this year, due to the rise in price, but even that has not invited spammers to think the block chain is a place for unsolicited advertising yet.  There have been rumblings that, eventually, a floating fee structure may be put into place that will create a kind of market around the confirming of transactions, thus further preventing spamming.  Additionally, some, like Palmer, don't believe that bitcoin's proof of work (which creates the need for bitcoin mining) is the best way forward, and all sorts of different scenarios could be introduced to replace it.  Palmer told CoinDesk:  ""I'm quite openly against [proof of work] mining as the future of digital currencies.""  This could usher in more experimentation with consensus, using totally different incentive structures, and could even include the creation of specific disincentives for data that bloats a ledger.  The comparison to email – again  Marc Andreessen proposed in his widely-read New York Times piece Why Bitcoin Matters that bitcoin could help solve problems associated with email spam.  Ironically enough, though, bitcoin could have problems of its own in terms of being able to limit spam-like issues in the block chain.  Interestingly, it has been the work of Google, in collaboration with non-profits like the Spamhaus Project, that has provided technology that can reduce the amount of email spam users actually see, making unsolicited emails largely an issue that only technology professionals must contend with.  As far as bitcoin goes, whether it is through a side chains or a brainwave from some startup developer, a method to eliminate the threat of cryptographic-based block chain spam will be developed.  Companies like BitHalo, for example, are already trying to avoid block chain bloat by using a peer-to-peer system to connect one party to another for the distribution of smart contracts.  This is an interesting idea, but, for bitcoin, the bigger problem to contend with right now is achieving mass consumer adoption. Of course, increasing user numbers could provide extra incentives for block chain spammers.  The question, in the end, may come down to the future of mining fees, given that they are what will end up supporting the future network when block generation is no longer a revenue stream for miners. This will likely be the ultimate factor in determining bloat, which transactions will be confirmed – and which ones will not.

42425992,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhozh,1409764492,Coin Academy Launches Online Classes for Budding Bitcoiners,"A newly launched website, Coin Academy, says it is the first digital currency education platform to bring both original courses and curated materials together under the one roof.  Coin Academy  co-founder, alternative economics expert Stephen DeMeulenaere, said, ""The sudden emergence of digital currencies, like bitcoin, left the education and training market struggling to keep up.""  He added:  ""We found a number of good tutorials and interviews on the web, but we found a lot more poorly produced unprofessional pieces.""  The company currently offers three original courses on bitcoin and digital currency use aimed at beginner users and merchants.  It also provides curated collections of materials from other sources around the web, covering subjects including digital currencies and value exchange networks, such as litecoin, dogecoin, peercoin, ripple and NXT.  All courses are free of charge and Coin Academy is currently using a donation model (via fiat, bitcoin or a selection of altcoins) to fund itself, but is also hoping to raise money from advertising and other sponsorships in future.  DeMeulenaere told CoinDesk:  ""We know we need to generate revenue or we won’t last [...] It’s all about being able to source great content, so whatever it takes to make that happen is the bottom line.""  Expanding content  Coin Academy's original courses consist of video tutorials with clear step-by-step instructions and plenty of visuals.  The course 'Digital Currency Ownership: Before You Begin' covers the basic concepts along with important security tips, through to setting up wallets and using exchanges.  DeMeulenaere said the company's priority was to help people get into the digital currency world, but the team also want to be able to satisfy those hungry for more and who already have basic knowledge.  Coin Academy is exploring the idea of taking submissions from other content creators, bringing in experts on specific subjects.  ""As we expand our teacher roster, we hope to be able to dive deeply into specific topics with subject matter experts. But, to be honest, at the end of the day, we’re looking closely at our usage stats to identity the areas that attract highest levels of interest and will prioritize those.""  While there are currently no assessment exercises upon completion of each session, each tutorial has a section for user discussion and interaction on that topic.  Collections sourced from elsewhere include video tutorials, podcasts, presentations, slideshows and documents that Coin Academy has deemed sufficiently high in quality.  Coin Academy is also looking to supplement popular topics like bitcoin investing, mining, dogecoin and ripple with original work of its own in the near future.  Gathering information  Coin Academy's other content creator and co-founder is Ric Shreeves, a web developer and author of a several books on open-source technology and content management systems like Joomla and Drupal. He also provides the voiceover for the firm's original tutorials.  When asked why the company chose to include external resources in its offerings, Shreeves explained that, before Coin Academy, there was the problem of digital currency learning resources being scattered around various websites and video platforms.  ""It’s in everyone’s best interest that this information be easily available,"" he said.  ""Stephen and I attended a number of bitcoin related events, only to see people struggle with the same basic set of questions every time.""  Other online materials  Other popular online learning platforms already offer bitcoin- and digital currency-related materials as part of their wider selection, including Khan Academy and Udemy, among others.  The University of Nicosia in Cyprus also offers a full online Masters degree in digital currencies – the first six weeks of which are available as a free MOOC (Massive Open Online Course).  Other sites, such as the venerable bitcoin.org, offer plenty of materials for bitcoin newcomers, though generally not in course form.

42425984,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhorh,1409762886,Xapo: New York's BitLicense Proposal Threatens Consumers,"Xapo has announced that it will exclude customers residing in New York should the state's BitLicense proposal pass in its current form.  Penned by founder and CEO Wences Casares, Xapo's blog post joins a growing chorus of bitcoin companies that have issued public statements on the matter.  In August  , on behalf of bitcoin services startup Circle, CEO Jeremy Allaire criticised issues in the proposal that he said could ""discourage innovation"".  Casares builds on Allaire's arguments throughout, stating that while Xapo is not against smart regulation, New York's proposal overreaches. As a result, he argues, it threatens not just the wider digital currency ecosystem and its potential to grow and innovate, but consumers as well.  The CEO said:  ""New York’s proposed BitLicense in its current form is the wrong form of regulation and in fact poses a threat to New York and New York consumers. [...] We believe that at this early stage in bitcoin’s history, investing the time needed to arrive at the right regulation is time well spent.""  Regulation that hurts the industry will also harm consumers, who may be forced to use inferior financial services, Casares added, stating:  ""The provision of services simply will not be up to the standards that we aim to provide, and New York consumers will suffer the consequences.""  Casares went on to criticize New York's BitLicense proposal as anti-competitive, given that it would favor well-capitalized companies. The comments are notable as Xapo now leads the bitcoin industry in total VC funding.  Launched in March, Xapo has raised $40m to date. The company offers bitcoin wallet, storage, and most recently, brokerage services.  Timely and deliberate action  Like many of his peers, Casares praised New York's regulators for their willingness to engage with the industry on crafting regulations. He lauded New York's decision to extend the comment period for the regulation in light of feedback for the industry.  New York, Casares said, would be wise to continue to adopt this collaborative approach:  ""We are at a pivotal time in the bitcoin industry and New York has an opportunity to achieve a leadership role in the space. To do so, however, we believe NYDFS should carefully consider the concerns of the broader bitcoin community regarding the substance of the BitLicense and consider a more orderly timeline for its adoption.""  Casares further offered the assistance of his legal and compliance teams to New York regulations. Still, he said that he believes regulators have much of the tools they need to police bad actors in the bitcoin industry, adding:  ""We believe the existing regulatory landscape, such as regulations applicable to money transmitters, are sufficient for purposes of consumer protection.""  Self-regulation with assistance  While Casares was critical of New York's proposal, he emphasised that the right regulation will benefit the bitcoin industry and empower it to serve consumers with more robust offerings.  In particular, Casares cited bitcoin's use in illegal marketplaces such as Silk Road and the collapse of the market's once-leading exchange Mt Gox as obstacles the industry has met and overcome.  Casares praised the work of the entire bitcoin ecosystem, naming companies such as BitGo, BitPay, Bitstamp, Circle and Coinbase as those leading the way for the industry to embrace new solutions that make owning and using bitcoin safer, stating:  ""The goal is to boost customer protection and confidence – and we as an industry have done so because our customers, not regulators, demand it.""  Casares concluded by stating that Xapo intends to file formal comment on the NYDFS proposal and that it will alert the bitcoin community through its blog when it does so.

42426005,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhpRh,1409752922,DigitalTangible Launches Crypto 2.0-Powered Gold and Bitcoin Market,"DigitalTangible has announced the formal launch of its crypto 2.0-powered, decentralized marketplace for gold and bitcoin traders.  While existing services allow bitcoin users to buy gold with bitcoin, DigitalTangible offers a novel innovation for the market, using an underlying crypto 2.0 protocol that issues tokens representing physical gold and attaches them to bitcoin addresses, thereby allowing traders to seamlessly move between bitcoin and gold.  Speaking to CoinDesk, DigitalTangible founder Taariq Lewis framed his service as one that will better cater to the needs of bitcoin's existing gold enthusiasts, while attracting members of the wider precious-metals community who may have yet to participate in digital currency markets.  Lewis told CoinDesk:  ""If you look at our homepage, you're looking at the price of bitcoin and the price of gold. If gold is going down and you own gold, and bitcoin is going up and you want to own bitcoin, you want to be able to move out of gold into bitcoin quickly and we're going to be the only platform for you to do that.""  While existing gold-buying services do cater to the community, Lewis painted these solutions as ill-equipped to handle the needs of his target investors.  A veteran of the crypto 2.0 community, Lewis previously worked for Mastercoin prior to starting DigitalTangible earlier this year. The formal unveiling follows DigitalTangible's soft launch on 23rd July.  DigitalTangible's gold tokens are currently being issued on the Counterparty and NXT protocols, though it supports a number of different alternatives.  Gold dealer support  DigitalTangible counts two of the more visible gold-buying services that cater to bitcoin users as partners – Amagi Metals, which recently announced it would cease to accept fiat currency by 2017, and Agora Commodities, which has sold more than $10m-worth of gold and silver for bitcoin to date.  The launch coincides with the formal unveiling of the firm's partnership with Amagi, and to mark the occasion, the companies are offering all customers free overnight shipping on select gold products for a limited time.  Lewis explained that both Agora and Amagi will sell gold on the DigitalTangible platform, competing for customers and thereby driving down costs for users. As the project's lead vendors, Lewis added that the partnership is attractive for Agora and Amagi as they can increase sales and drive down marketing costs.  Agora Commodities president and CEO Joseph Castillo framed DigitalTangible as a way to bring gold trading into the 21st century, telling CoinDesk:  ""Traders don't want to wait for gold to have to get to someplace or anything like that. The thing that [DigitalTangible] can do is it's a platform where gold and bitcoin can go between each other, instantly, and that's where I see the value in what they're doing.""  Castillo praised the project while also framing the partnership with DigitalTangible as another way his company is catering to gold buyers, many of whom, he indicated, still want to hold physical gold.  He added: ""I like what they're doing, I would like to have it for my own.""  Proof of custody  DigitalTangible is built on three layers of technology, with the topmost part being its e-commerce-inspired gold and bitcoin marketplace.  The platform is then supported by its crypto 2.0 protocol, which allows for trading between gold and bitcoin, and its custodian network that provides the gold listed on the platform and stores the holdings.  Agora and Amagi ship the gold they sell to a depository service, where the third-party will verify that the shipment has been made for customers.  To encourage trading, DigitalTangible's website features a 'proof of custody' section that aims to ease the potential anxieties of prospective buyers. The page shows a list of the platform's top asset holders, along with detailed listings of their precious metals holdings and their estimated value in bitcoin.  Lewis explained that his company does not act as a custodian of any of the assets that users purchase on the marketplace. He noted that all gold is stored in third-party depositories and that customers retain the private keys for any bitcoins purchased on the platform.  DigitalTangible uses three services to store its gold on behalf of its customers, and added that the platform offers custody in Asia, Europe and the US.  Attracting gold buyers  Still, Lewis acknowledged that security alone is not enough to entice the market of buyers DigitalTangible is looking to attract, suggesting that his platform will also seek to provide a cost savings to traders.  Lewis said that while low premiums are a luxury usually only afforded to large gold buyers, his platform will remove this restrictive cost while retaining high-quality offerings:  ""We're selling the highest-quality gold at essentially zero premium, since we are now bringing Amagi and Agora to a platform where they can try to get customers onboard with us. So, the premiums for gold on our site are the lowest you'll find.""  Of course, while bitcoin enjoys some support from the gold community, not all gold investors are enthusiastic about alternative digital stores of value. As such, DigitalTangible and its partners are investing in a marketing push that aims to fight against any negative perceptions of bitcoin.  Lewis suggested that DigitalTangible will target the gold market through traditional digital marketing strategies, while its partners, Agora and Amagi advertise their services through popular bitcoin websites.  He added that the company is also ""trying to reach out to people who are managing their own retirement accounts, doing their own retirement planning"".  Evaluating opportunities  Given that DigitalTangible is a decentralized marketplace, Lewis also addressed the possibility that his service would expand beyond gold. However, he suggested that, as of now, his team wants to specialize in gold in order to provide the best user experience.  Lewis cited the sheer size of the gold market as a reason that this specialization is a long-term businesses advantage, noting that it's a more than $5tn annual market.  Still, he says he has been approached by a number of altcoin developers that want to add their offerings to the service, as such, Lewis indicated the opportunities for expansion are being considered, concluding:  ""If we can do gold really well, then any asset is open to us. Don't be surprised if you see cocoa beans here. We've seen a lot of scams, people pre-announce stuff that's not ready, so we've been really trying to navigate that properly to launch an amazing product to do something that was previously costly and impossible.""

42425989,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhoxh,1409749889,FinTech Manifesto: Government Should Make UK Bitcoin-Friendly,"More than 150 startups and venture capitalists have backed a new manifesto outlining a number of recommendations for the UK's FinTech industry that include bitcoin-friendly legislation.  The 'Startup Manifesto’, as it is called, was published by the Coalition for a Digital Economy (Coadec) this week, and was authored by Guy Levin, the coalition's executive director. Notable investment firms backing the proposal include Index Ventures, King and Seedcamp.  Coadec is sponsored by Google, Intuit, TechHub and iHorizon.  FinTech recommendations  The document urges the British government to enact a number of new laws and adopt several business-friendly policies, ranging from tax cuts to visa reforms, but much of the focus is on the financial technology industry.  The manifesto notes that the government has already made adopted a number of policies designed to foster innovation, citing Project Innovate as an example.  Notably, however, another of the FinTech recommendations is for the creation of a new legal framework for digital currencies:  “The next government should continue this support, including reviewing the major barriers around fintech innovation. This should include looking at the regulation of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. HMRC should take the lead in being one of the first tax authorities to establish a framework relating to tax, VAT and other compliance requirements related to cryptocurrency.”  Other measures that could potentially affect bitcoin in Britain involve a proposed review of anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) rules. The manifesto suggests Britain should discard analogue identity technology and move to a new digital system for documents such as birth certificates, exam and degree certificates, driving licences and other documents.  “Moving towards secure online identity assurance will unlock innovation for startups. For example, FinTech companies who are required to conduct Anti-Money laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) checks on their users would benefit from using digital identity checks,” the manifesto states.  Government support  The government is already working with five identity providers to create a new system for identity assurance for government services. Coadec argues digitalisation should be expanded beyond government services, as it would help all businesses, but startups in particular.  Last month saw the launch of a new initiative designed to support innovation in the financial sector in the UK. Innovate Finance aims to establish the country as a market leader in the FinTech sector.  The high-profile launch was attended by Chancellor George Osbourne who used the opportunity to buy some bitcoin on a Robocoin ATM.  Project Innovate  is another example of Britain’s eagerness to foster innovation in FinTech. The initiative was announced by the Financial Conduct Authority last June. The regulator said it wants to ensure innovative developments like bitcoin are supported by Britain’s regulatory environment.

42425991,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhp1h,1409744963,Google Analyst: Bitcoin Could Be 'The Internet of Money',"Bitcoin holds potential to act as “the Internet of money” if regulated correctly, according to a new report from Google policy advisor Andy Yee.  In an article for Internet Policy Review, Yee, who works as an analyst for Google's Asia-Pacific division, arguesthat certain sectors of the bitcoin economy should be targeted with regulation modelled on existing digital frameworks.  Breaking the bitcoin ecosystem down into layers, Yee concluded that businesses that connect investors and consumers with digital currency should be subject to regulation.  In contrast, users and developers are a poor target, he added, because of the broader nature of the Internet.  Yee wrote:  “The logical and user layers are populated by private actors from the bitcoin community and real economy respectively. These actors are small and can easily escape from regulation and enforcement. At the information layer, intermediaries of various kinds have emerged to bridge the two networks. Their position in the Internet architecture enables them to capture information flows and identify wrongdoers. In addition, they are larger and more established actors, making them more amenable to state regulation.”  The paper goes on to advocate for a regulatory approach that allows innovation to take place while addressing the concerns of consumer safety advocates, financial regulators and law enforcement agencies.  Restrictions not needed  A concern often voiced by politicians and policy makers is that bitcoin, as a technology, is too opaque to allow for relaxed legal boundaries. This is why Yee and others suggest that any proposed rules should target services that actually handle people’s money rather than those creating cryptocurrency software.  Yee added that the block chain actually provides regulators with a trove of useful information.  As bitcoin is a pseudonymous transaction network – and research has shown that network identity has the potential to be deduced through pattern analysis – regulation shouldn’t be crafted with the mindset that digital currencies are too far in the digital shadow, he said.  Yee concluded that many of the same rules that apply to financial companies could be used to regulate bitcoin, but only after finding a happy medium that allows companies to thrive, saying:  “These laws and regulations of general applicability can in theory be applied to the emerging non-financial, information-based companies in the bitcoin economy. But a balance needs to be struck between eliminating instances of gatekeeper-aided wrongdoings and avoiding excessive burdens on gatekeepers.”  Illicit use a non-issue  Yee addressed bitcoin’s use in global narcotics markets, as well as other illegal activities, saying that regulators are right to target drug dealers but need to refrain from harming law abiding members of the nascent industry unnecessarily.  The debate shouldn’t be contentious, he adds, because criminals using bitcoin are likely to redeem it for fiat currency. At this point, those persons must interact with service-level companies that would fall under any proposed bitcoin regulation.  Yee stated:  “Criminals need to go through intermediaries in this layer to exchange between the bitcoin and real economies. As a result, these exchange mediums collect and retain significant amounts of information, which can be utilised by law enforcement to detect money laundering and the underlying criminal activity.”  He concluded by saying that any legal framework targeting digital currency need to be founded on an “adaptive” approach. By doing so, financial regulators can “ensure that illicit activities can be deterred while ensuring that society can fully benefit from the innovation and creativity on the bitcoin network.”  Google's bitcoin exploration  Notably, Yee is not the first Google official to go on the record and speak about the possible applications of both bitcoin and block chain technology.  For example, the company’s director of ideas, Jared Cohen, termed digital currencies “inevitable” at this year’s SXSW conference.  Bitcoin has been on Google’s radar as far back as 2011, when embattled Wikileaks founder Julian Assange advocated for the technology in a wide-ranging conversation with Cohen and Google chairman and then-CEO Eric Schmidt.

42425999,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhpFh,1409741266,"Indonesian Project Makes Bitcoin Available at 10,000 Stores","Residents of Indonesia can now buy and receive bitcoin over the counter at over 10,000 'Indomaret' convenience stores around the country.  The project was developed on the initiative of Bitcoin Indonesia and will run through its exchange Bitcoin.co.id in partnership with payment processor iPaymu.  According to Bitcoin Indonesia founder Oscar Darmawan, this now puts bitcoin within easier reach of the country's large unbanked population, estimated at over 200 million.  According to the World Bank's Financial Inclusion Data from 2011, only 20% of Indonesians aged 15 years or over have an account with a formal financial institution. Given that Indonesia is the world's fourth most populous country with a population of 250 million, that is a huge number of people in need of a better payments network.  A system for the unbanked  Users of the service will first need to create an account with Bitcoin.co.id, then select 'Top-up via Indomaret'. They are then provided with a code to take to their nearest Indomaret convenience store, along with some cash, before returning to their online account where they will find their bitcoin waiting.  To those living in a world of electronic bank transfers, this payment method may seem a little time consuming. However, it is not a lot different than a trip to a bitcoin ATM and, if the only method of making payments available to you is the cash in your hand, it may be the easiest onramp to bitcoin's international network.  The only 'catch' with the system is that to use the convenience store option, customers currently must have Internet access to use the exchange. Darmawan indicated that another product is in the pipeline to enable those without even web resources to source the digital currency.  Bitcoin's rise in Indonesia  Bitcoin.co.id has grown markedly since it began operations last December. At that time, bitcoin was little-known in Indonesia and the exchange traded only about 5 BTC per day.  By the time it launched a full open-order exchange in May, it was processing about 30 BTC in trades daily, indicating bitcoin's growth in popularity.  Bitcoin's public prominence in Indonesia is thanks to the advocacy efforts of local enthusiasts like Darmawan, meeting with regulators and signing up merchants.  Bitcoin Indonesia has also played a key role in the Bali-based BitIslands project, a campaign to promote bitcoin use and acceptance in the popular tourist destination.  That project has also been successful so far: its latest addition is the BitTour travel services agency, which allows tourists to pay for flights, trains, tours and hotel accommodation.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/03/indonesian-project-makes-bitcoin-available-at-10000-stores,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/43408fe99dc5a84bf2ceace5b0db26a76a8617cb-1260x918.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
