42378672,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lIJZ,1461621623,Bitstamp Could Face 'Bumpy' Road in Europe Despite New License,"Long one of the world's more prominent bitcoin exchanges, Bitstamp received a publicity boost today with the news that it had been granted a license to operate as a fully regulated payment institution (PI) in Luxembourg.  In statements, Bitstamp touted the license as one that enables it to become the first ""fully licensed"" bitcoin exchange in Europe.  The news, which had been rumored for weeks, received varying reactions from market observers, with remarks divided between those who saw Bitstamp’s license as a boon for an industry still trying to shake its association with crime, and those who felt that Bitstamp may face more hurdles in its attempt to offer services throughout the European Union.  Positive sentiment was perhaps best voiced by Chris Skinner, the founder of a new venture capital firm focused on blockchain, who stated that he believes the news is evidence of the ""increasing acceptance"" of cryptocurrencies.  Skinner told CoinDesk:  ""The fact that an EU member state gave that license to Bitstamp, a firm who had security issues, shows the increasing credibility of the bitcoin community. This is one to watch.""  This view was echoed by Mangrove Capital Partner Michael Jackson, who said that the news should be viewed as a validation of the Bitstamp team.  Still, others questioned whether other countries would immediately recognize Bitstamp’s Luxembourg payment institution license.  Adam Vaziri, founder of FinTech-focused legal consulting firm Diacle, indicated that other countries in the EU may decide that the license does not correspond to the business activities Bitstamp is conducting, and that further negotiations could be expected.  News of Bitstamp's new license coincided with the launch of BTC/EUR trading on the exchange. The startup stated that its license would not go into effect until 1st July.  Business implications  In comments, the news was most often compared to the e-money license obtained by bitcoin-based payment services firm Circle earlier this month.  A notable difference, according to blockchain-focused lawyer Jacek Czarnecki, is that Bitstamp is unable to issue its own electronic money, but that, like Circle, it can now offer services in other countries in the European Economic Area by notifying local regulators.  But, Czarnecki was not alone in commenting on how Bitstamp’s license could be treated differently by EU-based regulators. Juan Llanos, blockchain compliance executive at Skry, said that having the license does not ""guarantee"" it will be accepted in other jurisdictions.  ""Now starts the process of 'passporting' the license to other European countries, which is a significantly more simplified process than applying for a new license,"" he said. ""However, the payments authorities of each countries do their own due diligence on the company, as well as their own risk assessments, and then determine whether to approve it or not.""  In some cases, Llanos said, jurisdictions could impose additional requirements.  Vaziri, in turn, elaborated on this with examples of regional legal differences.  ""The FCA in the UK considers [virtual currency] exchanges to sit outside of the PSD mainly because the primary purpose of the exchange is not the provision of payment services. In Germany, BaFin considers [virtual currency] exchanges to be offering trading in 'financial instruments',"" he said.  In statements to CoinDesk, Bitstamp reaffirmed its belief that it is now licensed to operate throughout Europe.  ""The EU's rule of passporting means it's automatically licensed in all member states,"" a spokesperson said.  The exchange did not provide details on how it is approaching the passporting process.  Continental divide  As with Circle’s announcement, market observers were again quick to highlight the different regulatory approaches taking place in Europe and the US, with some respondents viewing the news as a sign that innovators are looking to stay out of North America.  Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at non-profit industry advocacy group Coin Center, for instance, said that the US is in danger of losing its ""brightest innovators"" due to the legal complexities of its current regulations.  ""[Bitstamp’s news] draws a stark contrast with the US where current policy suggests an exchange will need to repeat the licensing process some 50-times over, state by state,"" Van Valkenburgh said.  Commentators from Europe didn't see eye-to-eye with this take, though.  Vaziri, by contrast, called the European market ""just as bad"" as the US in terms of its fragmentation due to how different jurisdictions treat various licenses, even though measures such as the PSD have laid the groundwork for companies to lower the barriers to entry in payments markets.  ""The Single Market in financial services is not complete nor is it in continual sync with the pace of innovation,"" he continued.  Further, both Vaziri and Llanos mentioned that the the license follows the Paris terrorist attacks last year, which has placed additional pressures on regional regulators.  Llanos added:  ""The road ahead is long and could get bumpy, especially in light of the recent terrorist attacks, which are bound to harden Europe's policy positions with respect to the prevention of terrorist financing.""  Exchange market shake-up  The part of the ecosystem that may be most immediately impacted by the news, however, is Europe's trading market, which will see a new competitor in the BTC/EUR trading pair.  Long dominated by Kraken, the US-based exchange is the current market leader with 6,400 BTC (nearly $3m) in bitcoin traded daily, according to BitcoinCharts. Other entrants in the region include itBit and Coinbase, though their volumes are less than half than that of Kraken’s.  Representatives from bitcoin trading network Whale Club suggested that the license may not be helpful in attracting attention back to the Bitstamp exchange, which they suggested has been falling out of favor with active daily traders due to a lack of compelling features.  While Bitstamp is currently the fourth-largest exchange by BTC/USD volume, it has perhaps received the most attention in the wake of its 2014 funding round and the fall of Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt Gox.  Following the demise of what was then the world's largest exchange, Bitstamp emerged as the market leader. Today, however, it lags behind Bitfinex, BTC-e and Coinbase in daily volume.  The exchange also drew headlines in early 2015, when it lost $5m in BTC in a cyberattack.

42378667,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lIFn,1461619037,Why Your Business Needs a Blockchain Czar,"William Mougayar is a Toronto-based entrepreneur, investor and advisor to Consensus 2016, CoinDesk's flagship conference. He is also the author of the upcoming book, The Business Blockchain.  In this opinion piece, Mougayar discusses the common ways that enterprise businesses are seeking to establish and roll out blockchain strategies as part of their innovation initiatives.  Despite its rising importance in finance and business, the blockchain is not going to make a big impact until it reaches the highest level of corporate echelons, the boardroom.  While some boards have been discussing the blockchain, the nature of these discussions means they often treat their subject matter as a curiosity. Boards with blockchain visionaries driving innovative agendas from the top down are, without a doubt, the absolute minority.  For many, this is because they have not sought to define a blockchain strategy. For example, a serious boardroom discussion is not likely to happen until clarity emerges on the particular direction that an organization is headed toward.  This means establishing how the company can get organized to attack the issue; how various use cases should be selected, developed and deployed; and how the benefits of blockchain solutions will be evaluated versus existing legacy solutions.  But, fleshing out a blockchain strategy is not a simple task.  Typically, it starts in the middle layers of management when someone is tasked to marshall a company's internal resources and investigate the various questions and options.  But, even with a central orchestrator in charge, it takes some time for the blockchain topic to gain momentum, understanding and share of mind within senior executive ranks.  Still, organizations can benefit from understanding how others have navigated this path.  Here are three of the most common ways:  1. Building a lab  Some companies are funding a ""Blockchain Labs"" entity that includes software engineers who can get their ""hands dirty"" as soon as ideas come to the fore and need to be demonstrated.  Such organizations typically have an internal focus to ""show and sell"", or educate the blockchain's possibilities to other business units and departments within the organization.  The lab is sometimes part of the Innovation group that is chartered with importing the latest technologies into the organization by figuring out the intersection and integration points.  However, importing innovation is one thing, but applying it is another. The challenge will be not in the incubation of ideas, but rather in how these concepts get handed over to other departments and business units that serve as the real implementations playgrounds.  2. Task forces  Other organizations have formed an internal blockchain task force comprised of different business unit stakeholders, who meet and communicate on a regular basis.  One scenario I have seen with this option is to have two co-chairs of that committee, one from the business side, and another from the technical side. Just like IT, blockchains fall in the business-technology realm.  The challenge with this type of approach is that not all of these stakeholders may be at the same level of knowledge or motivation, and they may not agree on a given direction. The role of this group could be more about sharing and collective learning, rather than influencing a given direction.  Given the distributed nature of the task force approach, there is also a risk proof-of-concept initiatives won't be carried out with full diligence. POCs are notorious for reaching dead-ends, or not living-up to their expected benefits.  To be more successful, the task force will need to establish self-enforced guidelines and standards, so that the orchestration of activities continues to remain in sync.  3. Hybrid approach  The hybrid method is my favorite, because it combines the urgency of the lab approach with the organizational infiltration of the committee technique.  But to make this work well, you need to instill a central ""blockchain Czar"" role.  The origin of the czar analogy dates back to the reengineering days during the early 1990s when Michael Hammer and James Champy advocated this role in their book, ""Reenginering the Corporation"". The reengineering czar was that person who would become the rallying point for such efforts within a company.  Following the practices of process reengineering was business religion in its purest form, and it is my hope that blockchain initiatives and investments get the same treatment. For context, I held that business reengineering czar role at Hewlett-Packard back in the day, and I can vouch firsthand for the effectiveness of that approach.  The blockchain czar is responsible for removing obstacles within your organization, facilitating education, curating and sharing best practices, and overseeing the progress of various implementations across the organization. This job is a tough one, because it involves finding and obliterating old processes, instead of just automating or streamlining what is currently being done.  One of the activities to be undertaken under the hybrid approach is to find ideas within the various groups via a common discovery process, develop the proofs-of-concepts in the labs, then proceeding to implementing the best candidates with the business units who take direct ownership for them  Conclusion  Regardless of your chosen method, there are benefits in having at least one strong blockchain advocate who is a respected thought leader, bold communicator and an enthusiast about blockchain technologies.  The blockchain, in its fullest form, is a new strategic development platform. Strategic means that it is not just there to reduce costs and improve transactions latency. Strategic means that it needs to find strategic usages that can give you a leg up on your competition, or inject unique benefits to your customers.  To get on the board agenda, you need to showcase and explain the blockchain’s strategic role. The board wants to hear how the blockchain will give your company that competitive advantage, and not just how it's being tested here and there.  Best practices for internal approaches for blockchain strategies will be discussed during an upcoming panel at Consensus 2016, CoinDesk's flagship conference, with panelists who are leading blockchain initiatives from Barclays, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, Philips and Thomson Reuters.

42378658,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lI4T,1461613543,UK Treasury Won't Seek AML Rules for Bitcoin Wallet Providers,"The UK Treasury has said that it won’t seek to impose anti-money laundering (AML) rules on digital currency wallet providers in a bid to avoid overburdening those services.  The remarks were issued last week in a report that detailed the UK government's plans to tackle money laundering and terrorist financing risks more broadly. According to the report, the UK Treasury plans to bring digital currency exchange firms ""into anti-money laundering regulation"", reinforcing plans first announced last year.  However, an outstanding question at the time related to whether these rules would extend to wallet services that do not offer fiat-to-digital exchange functionality.  According to the new report, these companies will not have to face those kinds of requirements  The UK Treasury said:  ""This [focus on exchanges] is consistent with a risk-based approach, and we note that extending the perimeter of anti-money laundering regulations beyond digital currency exchange firms (eg to wallet providers) would not deliver any benefits in terms of mitigating money laundering and terrorist finance risk, and would place significant burdens on firms in this innovative and embryonic sector.”  Put more simply, the government appears to be taking the position that AML rules won’t be levied on other firms working in the digital currency space beyond wallet services, as well.  The report goes on to note that, following a review of feedback from law enforcement, academic and government sources, evidence points to ""a low level of illicit activity in digital currency networks"" – a possible factor in the regulatory approach outlined.  The government said in the report that it will also encourage information sharing among agencies, a process that would include exchanging data on ""new forms of transactions such as online banking and virtual currencies"".  According to the report, the government plans to overhaul its approach to anti-money laundering oversight over the next two years.

42378673,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lIM5,1461608773,Bitcoin Hits Four-Month High in Push Past $460,"The price of bitcoin reached an inter-day high of $464.24 today to reach its highest total in more than four months.  The news comes as the digital currency built on the previous week's gains, when it broke past the $450 mark on renewed optimism that a solution to the network's perceived transaction capacity issues may be forthcoming.  So far today, the bitcoin price has mostly moved within a tight range between $458 and $461. The digital currency reached a low of $455.99, but had recovered to $463.86 at the time of report.  Bitcoin's inter-day price last exceeded $465 on 19th December, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index figures reveal. At the time, bitcoin had been gaining new momentum as it hit annual highs for 2015.  But the latest move comes as the bitcoin price breaks what market observers have said are psychologically important price points of both $440 and $450.  The increase further comes in the wake of the release of the code for Segregated Witness (SegWit) and before the anticipated halving of rewards for bitcoin miners, a change to the network's operation expected to take place in July.  The digital currency’s recent gains provide a contrast to the month ending 25th April, as the currency fluctuated between $410 and $430 for most of this period.  Charles L.

42378662,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lI8F,1461606379,SBI Leads Japanese Bitcoin Exchange’s $27 Million Series C,"Japan-based bitcoin exchange bitFlyer has raised ¥3bn, or just shy of $27m, in a Series C funding round led by Venture Labo Investment and SBI Investment, the venture capital division of financial services conglomerate SBI Group.  The announcement is the latest for bitFlyer, which raised ¥510m ($4m) as part of a funding round last August that included Dentsu Digital Holdings, Mitsubishi UFJ Capital Co, Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Venture Capital Co and Venture Labo.  In interview, bitFlyer CEO Yuzo Kano indicated that the funding could be used to double the size of the exchange’s 23-person team, currently based in Tokyo and Luxembourg.  Kano said that the funding was due to bitFlyer’s focus on both bitcoin trading and blockchain applications more broadly, telling CoinDesk:  ""Investors value our technical advantage. We are almost the only company that has been focusing on both virtual currency and blockchain from day one.""  Kano said that bitFlyer’s banking investors are primarily interested in its blockchain technology work, as well as what he described as “various FinTech related resources” that the company has in addition to its digital currency exchange.  According to data from Coinmarketcap, the exchange saw volume for its BTC/JPY trading pair totaling $8.8m in the last 24 hours, a figure that places it ahead of competitors BTCBOX and Zaif.  The new capital brings BitFlyer’s total funding to more than $34m over five investment rounds.

42378661,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lI9V,1461603005,DARPA Seeks Blockchain Messaging System for Battlefield Use,"A major US defense agency devoted to advanced R&D is seeking to create a secure, blockchain-based messaging system.  Disclosure of the still-theoretical system, comes courtesy of a notice posted to the website of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), an office in the US Department of Defense (DoD) that has long played a role in promoting emerging technologies.  Among the more famous DARPA projects as ARPANET, a predecessor of today’s Internet.  According to the notice, DARPA is seeking pitches for a ""secure messaging system"" that would use a ""decentralized ledger"" to facilitate the broadcast of encrypted secrets in a transparent fashion.  The notice explains:  ""There is a critical DoD need to develop a secure messaging and transaction platform accessible via web browser or standalone native application. The platform separates the message creation, from the transfer of the message within a secure courier to the reception and decryption of the message.""  DARPA envisions three stages for the project.  The first would focus on the development of a system ""built on the framework of an existing blockchain framework"", suggesting that an existing blockchain like bitcoin’s could be used directly or as inspiration.  From there, prototypes and commercial-scale versions of the network would see development and deployment, according to the notice.  Possible applications  According to DARPA, the proposed system could function as a means for offices within the DoD to interact with one another in a secure way.  Specific applications include the use of the network to organize satellite communications or facilitate interdepartmental purchases within the DoD.  The notice states:  ""By doing this, significant portions of the DoD back office infrastructure can be decentralized, 'smart documents and contracts' can be instantly and securely sent and received thereby reducing exposure to hackers and reducing needless delays in DoD back office correspondence. As an example, Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPR) could be implemented using the secure ledger.”  As a result, oversight of such purchase requests could be magnified due to the transparent nature of those distributed ledgers used, DARPA goes on to say.  The network would also potentially see battlefield applications. According to DARPA, the messaging system could be leveraged during instances in which troops are attempting to communicate.  ""Troops on the ground in denied communications environments would have a way to securely communicate back to HQ, and DoD back office executives could rest assured that their logistics system is efficient, timely and safe from hackers,"" DARPA wrote.

42378654,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lHzR,1461588050,ECB Paper: Distributed Ledgers Likely to Bring 'Gradual' Change,"The European Central Bank (ECB) has published a working paper on blockchain technology, examining its potential role and impact in securities markets.  Written by ECB economists Andrea Pinna and Wiebe Ruttenberg, the paper casts a wide net on the various possible market applications and repercussions distributed ledgers could have in the marketplace, while examining different uses for smart contracts within securities market infrastructure.  Entitled ""Distributed ledger technologies in securities post-trading"" and published on 17th April, the report echoes a growing chorus of industry stakeholders, regulators and market observers who see a potentially strong impact of the technology in finance.  Yet, the paper’s authors go on to argue that some market elements – particularly the regulated ones – won’t likely be replaced even if there is a broader sea-change brought on by the use of blockchain applications in finance.  The paper states:  ""The current debate on DLTs is very much focused on the technology itself, and on how disruptive the roll-out of this technology could be for the current post-trade market and its market players. It should, however, be kept in mind that, irrespective of the technology deployed, certain functions present in the post-trade market for securities will always need to be performed by institutions.""  Market could drive change  Overall, the paper provides a bird’s-eye view of the current post-trade settlement environment, establishing some of the pain points that blockchain advocates hope to improve with the technology.  ""Current market conditions – with low interest rates and the expectation of an increase in collateral demand due to regulatory changes – have squeezed financial intermediaries’ margins, making the fixed costs of non-profit making back-office procedures more of a burden,"" the authors write, adding:  ""Financial intermediaries are therefore hoping that DLTs may allow them to avoid certain reconciliation processes and reduce the amount of collateral and capital bound to the settlement cycle.""  Still, questions remain, the authors assert as the paper continues.  Outstanding infrastructural and legal questions, particularly related to the exact legal standing of a distributed ledger used by banks, need to be answered, they said.  Interoperability, the authors indicated was one such problem area.  In order for the technology to see significant adoption among major financial firms, standards of operation will be needed to actually connect any future networks that might take shape.  “Harmonization is...still needed,” the authors wrote. “To have market-wide gains in terms of safety and efficiency, every system in the market might need to be able to communicate with all the different DLTs adopted.”  Degrees of adoption explored  One notable part of the paper explores potential outcomes of the industry’s ongoing experimentation of blockchain tech.  Under one scenario, post-trade institutions use blockchain applications to improve overall efficiency, but their underlying infrastructure remains as-is. In this case, so-called “siloed” distributed ledgers would help operators shave costs, while still being subject to the same kind of interoperability challenges seen today.  On the more extreme end, peer-to-peer networks would potentially cut out the clearing and settling incumbents entirely, putting the hands of securities issuance and purchase entirely in the hands of investors and the companies selling those assets.  ""Companies and governments could issue their financial instruments directly on the ledger, which would be of particular interest to start-up companies issuing shares by private placement, whilst smart contracts would execute any corporate action automatically,"" the paper explains.  Ultimately, the paper’s authors state that it's still early to project the technology's exact impact. However, they speculate that any changes will happen over a longer timeline.  The paper concludes:  ""It is possible that a DLT may find its way into the mainstream market, but should this happen, it is more likely to cause a gradual change in processes, rather than a revolution in the market.""
