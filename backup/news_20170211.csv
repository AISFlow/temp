42427342,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1dzh,1486830604,Tokens For Time? Inside One Banking Exec's Blockchain Pet Project,"""The level of experimentation that’s now possible ... it’s just incredible.""  So says Alex Batlin, global blockchain lead for BNY Mellon, in a conversation about a new personal experiment he’s working on dubbed the 'Alex Batlin Time Token'. While not an official project tied to his duties for BNY, it’s undoubtedly an offshoot of his work with the firm, having spearheaded blockchain testing while at UBS as well.  The idea is fairly straightforward. Batlin created a token via the ethereum network, each of which represents a liability against a certain amount of his time. If you want Batlin to work for you, you send the token back. Should you decide you don’t want him to work, but you want to reap the value of his time, then sell it to someone else.  At its heart, Batlin says, the time token – outlined in a recent LinkedIn post – is an experiment in trust, specifically how one can effectively commodify trust in a digital format. In this instance, blockchain acts as a cost-efficient rail for distributing that digital commodity. On one hand, it’s kind of like a loan. On the other, it’s sort of like a new kind of equity.  One perspective, Batlin said in interview, is to look at it as a new way for lenders (in this case, anyone who buys the time tokens) to weigh the trustworthiness of borrowers.  He told CoinDesk:  “You are transitioning from evaluating the risk of the loan based on the asset you can recover to looking at who you are giving the loan to, and looking at the risk of not repaying the loan.”  One comparison he drew was with the so-called 'David Bowie Bond', a reference to an effort by the late musician David Bowie to securitize the future earnings of his music in the late 1990s.  As reported by Bloomberg, the $55m in bonds sold were backed by royalties he received. But going deeper than that, the bonds were backed by the continued success and relevance of Bowie’s music.  The more people buying the music, the more valuable the bonds became. From that perspective, the bonds were underpinned by the promise that Bowie’s songs would stay popular.  According to Batlin, it’s that kind of promise of value that forms the foundations of any kind of loan.  “What’s a loan agreement? What’s a mortgage?” he asked. “It’s a bit like a promise to work – you have to work to pay off the mortgage.”  Time on the chain  Granted, blockchain tech is unlikely to upend the basic concepts of lending overnight.  At the same time, the low barrier to access allows for experimentation in these new models, which Batlin said drew him to the concept in the first place. He cited past examples of attempts to tokenize time and value via third parties, but those efforts ran into questions of cost, trust, and actually finding an issuer who would bet on what is, from one perspective, an unsecured loan.  “But, here, the cost to experiment is so low that it’s feasible now,” he went on to say.  This approach also brings the concept of the free market efficiently determining the true value of an asset into play. If people start selling your token on the market en masse, for example, that would demonstrate to those on the outside that your time, perhaps, might not be that valuable to them.  On the other hand, market support would present a uniquely indicative degree of faith in the person issuing the token.  “If somebody bought something of your value ... and they keep buying more, that’s probably the best kind of recommendation you can get, because they see the value in what you’ve done and want more of it,” he told CoinDesk.  But to bring this kind of concept to fruition, Batlin suggested, more work might need to be done on the control side. For example, problems could arise if a time token issuer is faced with the prospect of having to work for a buyer that he or she finds unethical.  Real-world possibilities  But who exactly would benefit the most from this kind of model?  One example could be students, who, by economic or social circumstance, may be unable to tap the broader market for competitive student loans.  Current estimates put the amount of student loans in existence today in the US alone as high as $1.5tn. Further, higher education costs – from tuition to housing to student services – are also climbing, with little to indicate that those increases will cease anytime soon.  It’s in this kind of environment that a college student may want to take matters into their own hands. With a time token, they could sell the future value of their earnings, backed by a college degree, to potential investors who may want to benefit from that student’s individual talents down the road.  “This could even be a different kind of student loan, and that you hope to increase the value of that token,” Batlin suggested. “You get the money upfront if you’re a promising student, if your grades are good.”  Image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/02/11/tokens-for-time-inside-one-banking-execs-blockchain-pet-project,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a64b581b850bd1a1ab1c981f38098c1171a372ad-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42427337,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1drh,1486827764,What’s in a Name? From Bitcoin to Blockchain to Distributed Ledgers,"Nelson M Rosario is an intellectual property attorney working as an associate at Marshall, Gerstein & Borun in Chicago. He has years of experience working on patent prosecution matters in bitcoin/blockchain and fintech, as well as other areas.  In this CoinDesk opinion piece, Rosario ponders why we have developed so many terms for what is effectively the same technology – bitcoin.    – William 'Satoshi' Shakespeare (probably)    In the beginning, there was 'bitcoin', and it was good. But, bitcoin would end up bearing a nomenclature fruit salad that tests mortal comprehension. Perhaps, that is the natural way of things.  As a new technology develops, the number of people exposed to that new technology increases, and the language used to describe the new technology evolves.  Initially, the language was limited to bitcoin. Now a person is liable to see any of the following words or phrases that theoretically all mean different things: bitcoin, Bitcoin, block chain, blockchain, Blockchain, private blockchain, public blockchain, distributed ledger technology, distributed asset ledgers, decentralized ledger technology, shared ledgers, et al.  Further confusing the matter, the term bitcoin may not always mean the same thing to different people. What happened? Why the change in language?  First, bitcoin has the word 'coin' right in it. This naturally makes people think of currency. Not surprisingly, bitcoin use as a currency is far and away the most successful iteration of bitcoin. The applications for bitcoin are not, however, limited to currency.  This is where much of the confusion arises. Intuitively, the currency implementation for bitcoin (with the word coin in it) makes sense. Trying to convince someone that bitcoin can also be used for purposes as diverse as asset transfers, escrow services, or logistics management is not so straightforward.  Bitcoin also suffers from an image problem. The early publicity surrounding bitcoin included scandals, thefts, a euphoria akin to the Tulip bubble, and in general, bad press. 'Fake internet money', as some people called bitcoin, did not inspire confidence amongst the masses.  Additionally, the main advocates for the new technology were unpolished and unproven. Often if someone had heard of bitcoin they had heard of the failed Mt Gox exchange, or they assumed bitcoin was something a person used to buy illicit drugs or hire a hitman. The reality was not that far off.  How do you get people to forget about the failed exchanges, drugs, and hitmen? Get them to focus on 'the technology underlying bitcoin', and get them to think about the other potential implementations. Once the conversation moved beyond currency, people started searching for a new word. That search led them to the blockchain.  The rise of the blockchain  Negative publicity and conceptual confusion laid the groundwork for people to begin to refer to the blockchain as the real innovation to come out of the bitcoin phenomenon.  The blockchain is a chain of transactions that makes bitcoin possible. The term refers to a collection of bitcoin transactions grouped together into blocks and linked through cryptography. This linkage is part of what makes it virtually impossible to fake bitcoin transactions.  In a sense, the blockchain provides true decentralized trust and distributed consensus, but the rebranding, or reorienting of people’s attention, to the blockchain and away from bitcoin may be just a clever marketing trick.  Many people argue that you cannot separate the blockchain from bitcoin. The thinking is that you cannot break up bitcoin into its component parts because the parts by themselves will not work the same way independent of each other. In other words, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Regardless of whether this is correct, that is precisely what people have done.  Once the power of bitcoin became apparent, we started to see article after article touting the 'real innovation' behind bitcoin. Respectable and well-established firms began developing blockchain solutions to their problems.  People consistently discredited bitcoin as boring, while extolling the virtues of the multifaceted blockchain. Large banks, financial exchanges, and the 'Big Four' consultancies all rushed to publish reports on blockchain technology. The hype train that left the station heading to Bitcoinland was diverted to Blockchainville.  There are now hundreds of blockchain startups. Problems related to back end services for large institutions, digital identity, asset transfer, escrow, and logistics, are all being tackled by blockchain solutions. Even tracking pork along a blockchain has been proposed. These companies are doing truly innovative work.  However, to many observers the term 'blockchain' is still conceptually associated with bitcoin. So, if a company describes an innovation that leverages a type of blockchain they have to distinguish it from bitcoin and the bitcoin blockchain. How do blockchain companies talk about what they are doing without referencing bitcoin, or other blockchains? The solution is to talk about ledgers.  The arrival of distributed ledger technology  A ledger can record transactions between multiple parties. The ledger concept is a main building block of bitcoin and any blockchain. Ledgers also benefit from the fact that they are commonly thought of as boring, safe, and dependable tools in an accountant’s toolbox, as opposed to the technological innovation that makes bitcoin possible.  What better way to put thoughts of bitcoin and blockchain out of people’s minds than insisting that you are only talking about ledger technology? Thus, the conceptual chain to bitcoin was broken.  However, there remains considerable debate over whether this is feasible or even desirable. To early adopters, bitcoin is a monolith that cannot exist without distributed trust, consensus, and immutability, but many new industry entrants view the technology as an a la carte buffet. They are free to decide between many concepts including: permissioned vs permissionless, public vs private, tokenized vs no token, etc.  Today any institution or organization that refers to ledgers is free to discuss bitcoin or blockchain related concepts, without the supposed taint of bitcoin. Even the Federal Reserve Board (of Federal Reserve Bank fame), has touted ledgers in their recent report on “Distributed Ledger Technology.”  Over the past two years, hundreds of new blockchains and ledgers have been created. They all draw on the root concepts of bitcoin, but their purposes and the lingo used to describe them have diverged widely. This conceptual repackaging, and public relations approved language replacement, is likely to continue for some time.  What does it all mean?  This story has gone from bitcoin to blockchain to distributed ledger technology. There are companies that operate in all of these spaces, or only one of them.  Outside observers are forgiven if they struggle to keep up with all the different terms. Yet, through all of this evolution and upheaval, bitcoin has remained central to the discussion. Whether bitcoin, the blockchain, and distributed ledgers will be adopted and thrive or consigned to the ash heap of history remains to be seen.  The fact that bitcoin has undergone repeated repackaging is a testament to the strength of the technology. Other blockchains or related technologies may rise and fall, but bitcoin’s inertia and first-mover advantage will continue to make it the most relevant cryptocurrency, blockchain, and ledger.
