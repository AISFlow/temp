Reddit user taliesan -- who identifies himself as Geoffrey MacDougall, head of development at the Mozilla Foundation -- has been picking the brains of the Bitcoin community, asking for resources as the company researches whether to take donations in the cryptocurrency. ""There are a number of people on my team advocating for it, as well,"" he said.  First kicked off two days ago, the thread on the Bitcoin subreddit has received favorable reactions from fellow users, some of whom said they'd donate to contribute to a free and open internet, ""a shared goal of both the Mozilla project and the Bitcoin project.""  Earlier in April, Mozilla introduced a JavaScript API called navigator.mozPay() to simplify online payments within the Firefox OS.  The announcement -- in a blog post written by Kumar McMillan, a senior web developer focused on Firefox OS projects -- described some of the challenges of existing online payment systems, which include limited options, cumbersome management and security issues:  In most cases, the user has to type in an actual credit card number on each site. This is like giving someone the keys to your expensive car, letting them drive it around the block in a potentially dangerous neighborhood (the web) and saying please don’t get carjacked!  While Bitcoin was mentioned only in the last paragraph of that post, the comments raise hints that Mozilla is keeping an eye on the digital currency. This has been a recurring theme on the annals of reddit. Six months ago, a user tried to jump-start a campaign to ""convince Mozilla to accept Bitcoin.""  As demonstrated by MacDougall's latest thread, Mozilla seems to be listening.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC,Alice Truong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/29/mozilla-foundation-eyes-bitcoin-donations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/77915c620fbde47f54c1a63027537cfa756ed26a-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397166,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaZ0Ou,1369845070,Bitcoin exchanges need to grow up fast,"The relationship between big banks and their regulators is pretty dubious, to put it mildly. But expecting federal investigators to give Bitcoin exchanges the same free ride is childishly naive.  When HSBC got caught laundering money for drug dealers and terrorists, it promised regulators it would improve controls.  It didn't.  Senate investigators found the bank had failed to monitor $60 trillion in transactions for money laundering  and had a backlog of 17,000 dodgy account alerts which it failed to investigate. Which dwarfs LibertyReserve's alleged laundering of $6 billion.  HSBC shipped $7 billion in actual paper dollars  from Mexico back to the US during 2007 and 2008. Because of controls on big cash deposits at US banks, the money had been smuggled into Mexico so HSBC could ship it back to the US.  Mexican and US authorities told the bank that deposits so massive clearly raised red flags that they included drug money. Between 2006 and 2009, HSBC simply did not bother to monitor transactions from Mexico for money laundering and defined the country as low risk.  HSBC was so favored by drug cartels that the organizations began transporting their dollars in cash boxes specially designed to fit through the standard HSBC teller's window.  If dodgy drug dealing isn't against your moral code, what about terrorism? HSBC sent dollars to Saudi and Bangladeshi accounts with known links to al Qaeda. (See the Senate report below.)  It also sent $19.4 billion to accounts linked to Iran ... in breach of the Trading with the Enemy Act.  Most of this wasn't even secret: regulators knew about it and were gently pushing HSBC to clean up its act. The Senate Committee criticized regulators for doing so little:  ""yet during the six-year period from 2004 to 2010, OCC officials did not take any formal or informal enforcement action to compel HBUS (HSBC's US arm) to strengthen its AML (anti-money laundering) program, essentially allowing its AML problems to fester.""  HSBC was deemed ""too big to fail"" so a deal was done. It paid a relatively small fine -- $1.9bn -- and promised, again, to improve its processes.  But that doesn't mean that a new bank or exchange in this market can expect to be given the same free ride as HSBC.  Actions this week against Liberty Reserve show that the US takes money laundering seriously ... when it's not carried out by a big bank.  CryptoCurrent's decision to close  , and OKPay's decision to stop processing Bitcoin transactions shows that the message is getting through.  If you want to run an exchange which offers alternative coins for dollars, or vice versa, then you'd better get real about regulation.  It might be expensive and it might go against your libertarian beliefs but if you want to stay in business, and out of prison, you need to be talking to the regulators. You need to know who your customers are, or at least have evidence that you've tried hard to find out. Or you need to take your business, and yourself, properly into the shadows.  If you want to launder money -- choose dollars and use a bank. They've been caught before and they're still in business.  But raiding Bitcoin exchanges wins headlines for investigators, which helps them get bigger budgets for more investigations next year.  Bitcoin can stay immune from regulation but only if it stays online only. If you want to transfer it into fiat currency or put its value into a traditional bank account, then it comes under the remit of regulators.  We might not know what future Bitcoin regulation will look like, but we know it is coming fast.  In the late 1990s, hundreds of ""internet companies"" were launched. Some gloried in being ""beyond regulation"" ... the sensible ones kept quiet and did their best to obey the law where ever they operated.  In 1998, Amazon.com filed its year-end accounts: it made sales of $253 million for the final quarter, breaking through the $1-billion-a-year barrier after just four years in business.  But Amazon warned in its filing:  ""As the international online commerce market continues to grow, competition in this market will likely intensify. In addition, governments in foreign jurisdictions may regulate Internet or other online services in such areas as content, privacy, network security, encryption or distribution. This may affect our ability to conduct business internationally.""  Any Bitcoin company could do well to print that out and stick it on the wall. If $1 billion a year was not enough to make Amazon feel safe, then a few million dollars from venture capitalists and the Winklevii should not make alternative coin businesses believe they're beyond the rules.  Bitcoin is the same age as Amazon was in 1998 and worth about the same too.  The industry has a choice.  It can take a similar attitude to the bookseller and start talking to the grown-ups.  Or it can stay online, in its geeky niche, and be ignored by regulators and the police.

42397169,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaZ0Sq,1369839664,Is Litecoin the new Bitcoin alternative for investors?,"Early investors in Bitcoin have been handsomely rewarded for their belief that a decentralized currency could flourish. Despite Bitcoin’s volatile nature, it’s clear based on the volume of transactions per day (over 50,000) that Bitcoin has gained momentum. This has resulted in continued acceptance and adoption, creating a viable market.  This fact has led some people who missed out on the early days of Bitcoin to wistfully wish that they had only been informed sooner, to have known that Bitcoin would rise up, enriching those who got in early.  As a result, there is increased interest in other cryptocurrencies that have emerged since Bitcoin, and one of the most popular by trading volume has been Litecoin. With a market cap of $53 million and growing, Litecoin is the second largest decentralized currency after Bitcoin. And the number of Litecoin transactions is on the rise, a pattern that is consistent with Bitcoin’s overall growth and increased interest.  But what is Litecoin? How is it different from Bitcoin? Is there room for Litecoin as an alternative to Bitcoin?  The Basics  Litecoin, denoted as LTC, was released in late 2011. The developers of Litecoin took many of the concepts that made Bitcoin successful and tried to expand upon it, making a few key changes. They did this with hopes of improving upon Bitcoin’s features.  The three main differences between Litcoin and Bitcoin come down to speed of transactions, the amount of currency that will be produced and the design of Litcoin’s proof-of-work algorithm in scrypt. Let’s take a moment to explore each of these differentiating factors.  Speed  Litecoin is able to process transactions more quickly than Bitcoin. It offers less time to first confirmation. That may not be terribly important right now given that the market cap is pretty small for Litecoin. But the developers of Litecoin are thinking ahead to when more people are using it to pay for things. As the currency grows in popularity, transaction speeds could become important if people are relying on transfers to clear quickly. Much like how we currently dread when financial transactions drag out, this could be considered a similar situation when dealing with cryptocurrencies: they have to work, and transfers need to complete quickly.  This means that Litecoin has a higher possible transaction volume in the long run. Of course, that would have to mean people are actually using Litecoin for payments. At this point Litecoin is not at the stage where there is much of an economy around it, but that could change. Transaction numbers continue to increase as a result of the spike in Bitcoin prices that has occurred over the last few months.  Number of Litecoins  The number of Litecoins that will be produced as a result of mining will total 84 million. This means that there will be many more Litecoins than Bitcoins, which will ultimately only have 21 million in existence. Some have speculated that this will result in a diluted value for Litecoin, while others have predicted that there will be more liquidity.  The liquidity theory is hard to swallow, though, since – like Bitcoins – Litecoins can be divided into very small fractions anyway. Yet the number of Litecoins that will eventually be circulation likely will result in their value being less than Bitcoins, because they will not be as scarce. This could also result in Litecoins being used in different scenarios than Bitcoin.  Proof of Work  In simple terms, proof of work is requiring a degree of difficulty to process something. This is used in mining and processing transactions for both Bitcoin and Litecoin. By using this method, it makes the mining process “difficult” to create a market for mining. (Note: This is a very simplistic explanation of proof or work. Take a look at this to understand more how it relates to mining and processing cryptocurrencies.)  In terms of Bitcoin, proof of work is done using GPU-intensive SHA265 hashing. Litecoin uses an algorithm called scrypt that is more compatible with traditional CPUs. While Litecoin is not as heavily mined as Bitcoin, this makes it easier to mine with traditional computers. As Litecoin is adopted, however, this will change as there is more effort put into mining the currency for its increasing value.  Access to Litecoins  Litecoins are harder to obtain than Bitcoins. In fact, the method of exchanging cash for Litecoins is similar to Bitcoin in its early days. The major exchange that offers Litecoins is BTC-E, which is a Russian exchange. To transfer money to BTC-E, you’ll have to use an intermediary such as Perfect Money, which can be expensive since it charges a hefty fee.  Another way to obtain Litecoins that has become quite popular is to exchange Bitcoins for Litecoins. This BTC/LTC market itself is beginning to become quite popular, and many cryptocurrency experts believe that Litecoin can provide a certain degree of redundancy to Bitcoin. If a scenario were to occur that Bitcoin fails or there is some sort of temporary outage, Litecoin is perfectly capable of operating on its own since it is a separate peer-to-peer network.  Conclusion  The market for Litecoin continues to expand, despite limited access to the currency. It’s much easier for the average person to obtain Bitcoins right now. But just as with Bitcoin, as time goes by Litecoins will be easy to obtain as well. Mt. Gox announced plans back in April to add Litecoins to its exchange. Those plans have been delayed due to the problems that the exchange has experienced with DDoS attacks, and the company has established no concrete timeline.  Nevertheless, look for a spike in the value of Litecoins to occur simply because of the access to Litecoins that Mt. Gox can provide. Litecoin’s value as a backup to Bitcoin can’t be denied even if it never ends up being an equal to Bitcoin.  Although neither can be considered traditional commodities, it’s possible that Litecoin could be the silver to Bitcoin’s gold in their relationship to each another. Right now Litecoin adoption is slow going and access by the average person is ultimately a problem. But Litecoin’s slight advantages like the increased transaction performance over Bitcoin that could give it staying power.

42397167,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaZ0Qs,1369833653,San Francisco taxis promote Bitcoin,"Starting today, some 375 taxi cabs in San Francisco will start playing the ""We use coins"" Bitcoin-promoting video on their seatback monitors.  Unfortunately for Bitcoin fans, while the cabs will tout the digital currency, drivers will not accept it as payment for fares.  In addition, 75 out of the 375 taxis feature a still-image monitor as well as a video player facing passengers in the backseat. Bitcoin Forum member dadj said he was looking for local companies interested in advertising on the still-image monitors that they accept bitcoins as payment in their businesses.  Ironically, San Francisco's Yellow Cab Cooperative does accept payments using its own in-house payment system: the Yellow Travel Card. Unlike bitcoins, the Yellow Travel Card allows customers to limit their users' travel costs, cap trip numbers and designate whether trips were for business or personal use ... hardly the sort of information Bitcoin fans like to surrender.  Some Bitcoiners also questioned the effectiveness of showing the ""We use coins"" video, as it focuses a lot of attention on how to mine -- rather than spend or accept -- bitcoins.  Redditor k2p acknowledged the video could do more to promote the concrete examples of Bitcoin's benefits.  ""What is Bitcoin's most visual-friendly advantage?"" he asked. ""The simplicity of money transfers. Imagine someone at a garage sale trying to accept credit cards. Imagine some girl scouts going door to door selling cookies trying to accept credit cards. Now, switch that over to Bitcoin. All they need is a smartphone. They don't need a driver's license or credit history.

42397168,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaZ0Rr,1369818882,Coinbase adds paper wallets for bitcoins,"Coinbase, a hosted wallet service for Bitcoin, is now letting advanced users create and print paper wallets directly from their accounts.  Paper wallets offer a hard-copy, physical way to secure bitcoins offline in a way that's safe from hackers and other internet-based threats. However, Bitcoin holders need to ensure they keep their paper wallets in a safe place that's not accessible to anyone they don't trust.  A paper wallet stores both the owner's Bitcoin address and private key. The owner can continue to receive funds from anyone online via the public address, but no one other than the person with access to the printed, private key can withdraw funds.  While Coinbase says it will keep track of the paper wallets that customers create so they can conveniently continue to track their balances online. it does not keep any record of a customer's private key.  ""When done properly, paper wallets are one of the safest ways possible to store Bitcoins,"" notes the Bitcoin Wiki.  Bitcoiners discussing the new Coinbase feature, however, questioned whether the paper wallet generated would be as secure as it ought to be.  ""So the wallet is generated server side and the key also sent to a 3rd-party service to generate the QR code (https://chart.googleapis.com/chart),"" wrote redditor redditme234. ""There no guarantee that either service is not logging the private keys and pretty much defeats the purpose of cold storage.""
