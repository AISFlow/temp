42425064,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqIZh,1377624991,What happened at the US regulators' bitcoin meeting?,"The Bitcoin Foundation's meeting with representatives from a number of US government departments yesterday was productive and encouraging, according to Patrick Murck.  Murck, who is general counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation, said all parties at the meeting had a ""productive and frank"" discussion about digital currency. ""It was a positive first step for the industry in creating an open and on-going dialog. I left feeling very encouraged that we were able to dispel some myths and misinformation about how the bitcoin protocol works.""  Another attendee, Jim Harper, director of information policy studies at Cato Institute, shared this sentiment.  He said a number of topics were discussed at the meeting, which was held at US treasury building in Washington DC, including privacy, law enforcement and how government controls have the potential to strangle the industry before it has even had the chance to really get going.  ""We talked about how the weight of regulation in the US can, and does, drive bitcoin service providers to move outside of the country,"" Harper explained.  He suggested the Bitcoin Foundation was able to set the record straight on a number of digital currency-related issues, and that explaining what exactly the blockchain is and how it works largely dispelled the idea that there is some ""magical secrecy"" to bitcoin.  He went on to say:  ""I counselled against the practice of spreading FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) about bitcoin, which is already all too common. It’s not OK to talk bitcoin down without a factual basis.""  Bitcoin supporters at the meeting came face to face with a lot of sceptics, with one attendee posing a question that Harper said demonstrated a ""hostility to progressive change"". ""Most people were sceptical, but open-minded and fair,"" he concluded.  Many US-based bitcoiners fear regulators will take a harsh stance against digital currency. If this happens, some serious damage could be caused to the bitcoin ecosystem, as the country seems to contain the lion's share of bitcoin businesses and enthusiasts.  This year to date, Americans have downloaded the original bitcoin client 460,394 times, which is greater than the number of downloads in China, the UK and Germany combined.  Today, the Bitcoin Foundation will attend another meeting, this time at Capitol Hill, to further discuss legal issues surrounding cryptocurrency.

42425076,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqInh,1377617120,Bitmine to drop 4PH/s of ASIC power onto bitcoin network,"A Hong Kong-based investment company is ramping up an ASIC mining hardware business that will drop four Petahashes (PH/s) of computing power onto the network by the end of March.  Massive Luck Investments, domiciled in Hong Kong but registered in the British Virgin Islands, has taken a 50% stake in Swiss mining hardware manufacturer Bitmine, (formerly Exion Networks), which has been designing Avalon-based mining hardware. The new venture spans ASIC hardware sales to individual customers, hosted mining, and its own private mining pool.  Massive Luck Investments, which has offices in places including Manila and the UK, is a relatively new entrant to the bitcoin space. The firm, which also has operations in traditional gold and copper mining and rare earth metals, decided to get into digital mining after evaluating new market opportunities earlier this year. With Bitmine, it is buying existing ASICs from other manufacturers while also preparing to fabricate its own through a partnership with fabrication giant Global Foundries.  A senior spokesperson for Massive Luck, who asked not to be named, said:  “We had a board meeting which put together a small research group, tasked with making an initial assessment of business opportunities in the fledgling digital currency area. The team presented its report in early January, and the report identified the digital currencies as a potential area of disruptive technological breakthroughs, and a very promising investment opportunity.""  In February, Massive Luck decided to pursue digital currency as an opportunity in three areas: mining hardware, gaming, and the integration of digital currencies and traditional financial infrastructure. It has already started its bitcoin gaming operation, BetCoin ™ Dice, separately to its Bitmine venture. It hopes to steal significant market share from Satoshi Dice with the gaming operation.  The Bitmine ASIC mining hardware venture is pursuing three broad areas: retail equipment sales, hosted mining, and a private multi-Petahash mining operation. It will progress through three generations of ASIC chips in relatively rapid succession, starting with Avalon chips.  The Avalon OEM community has been a small but frustrated one. BitSynCom, the company behind the 110nm chip, has been promising supplies for months, with significant delays. However, last week, it said it is now shipping 40,000 each day. Tens of thousands went to a Swiss party who organized a group purchase. Bitmine CEO Giorgio Massarotto drove picked up between 37,500 and 40,000 chips over the weekend – that equates to around 16TH/sec of capacity.  This is just the first in three generations of chips that Bitmine will use, however. The second generation of ASICs on its timeline come from BitFury. They are built to a 55nm process and selling for $20 per GH/sec, and are designed using a process called fully depleted silicon on insulator (FDSOI). These chips will provide 2.5-3GH/sec per chip at 0.5-0.75W/GH. It will put 16 on a board.  “We plan to deploy it in four different configurations: 5, 10, 20, and 40 cards per unit, or roughly 250, 500, 1,000, and 2,000 GH/sec,” said the Massive Lucky exec.  The third generation ASIC, labeled CoinCraft, will be a 28nm in-house effort. It has been co-designed by a number of players, including Synapse, Innosilicon, and Verisilicon. The chip is built to scale with bitcoin network difficulty, by operating in three modes.  ""When the difficulty level is relatively low (the first 4-5 months of the life cycle) it can be set to TURBO mode, mining at 40GH/chip, 0.75W/GH,” said the spokesperson. ""As the difficulty increases, it can be adjusted to the REGULAR mode, mining at 30GH/chip, 0.5W/GH.” Finally, as difficulty scales, the chip can throttle back to a 20Gh ultra-low power mode at 0.35w/chip.  This chip will cost $6.8/GH in fully assembled boxes, which like the Avalon and Bitfury boxes will be available directly to end-users. Bitmine will take delivery of 100,000 of these chips from Global Foundry in November, giving it 4 Petahashes of power (not including the BitFury chips).  It expects to ship 1-1.5 Petahashes of power to customers who want to run the boxes themselves. However, this is really a chip for the cloud, as it enables the firm to dynamically adjust power consumption in a large-scale computing operation, and that’s where the other 2.5-3 Petahashes of power is going.  That's where the Asian datacenter and a $14m, 1.8 Megawatt supercomputer comes in.  Massive Luck Investments and Bitmine are jointly building a data center in China that will host mining power using the third-generation chips. That facility, which will cost just under $1 million for basic physical construction, will be finished around February, although it will start hosting CoinCraft processors in small quantities in December.  Massive Luck may mobilize the entire 5,000 workforce of one of its companies, Cutting Edge, to work in three shifts around the clock to assemble all mining units within a week or so in January. Around 0.5 Petahashes of CoinCraft computing power will be hosted for customer use.  The supercomputer comes later. Actually, there are two of them, built under an agreement with the Shanghai Supercomputer Center. One of them, to be delivered in Q4 2014, will cost $12m to build, and will offer CPU power designed for data modeling tasks (the normal things that academics do with supercomputers). Massive Luck Investments gets ""certain subsidies and exemptions"" in return for its help, because the Chinese government badly needs supercomputing power.  “The Chinese government provides preferential policies to attract FDI [foreign direct investment] in certain high tech areas that benefit the Chinese economy,” said the Massive Luck exec. “They require traditional CPU-based traditional computing power to address the acute shortage of it. Shanghai supercomputer center will be responsible for the overall facility design and staff training.""  However, the other supercomputer is scheduled for installation in March at the Bitmine/Massive Luck data center, and it’s where the firm’s 2PH of remaining ASIC hash power will go. This will cost $14m including the cost of the building, and the materials and labour for installing the equipment in the datacenter. However, the spokesperson says that Massive Luck owns and controls all of that power, promising that the Chinese government won't be able to begin manipulating the market with it.  It isn’t clear whether the firm will fabricate more CoinCraft chips after this. A lot depends on market variables such as bitcoin pricing and what other ASIC vendors are doing.  “We're following the CoinTerra developments very closely,” said the Massive Luck insider. “This is a dark horse, so a lot will depend on what they deliver.”  In the meantime, the 800,000 Avalon chips due to hit the market in the next few months are only the start, as mining becomes an increasingly cloud-based venture. Get ready to watch those difficulty charts spike even more this fall.

42425056,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqILh,1377608455,Coinbase waives fees for businesses' first $1 Million of sales,"Article updated on 28th August at 11:59 BST  Coinbase, the bitcoin merchant service, has announced it will scrap processing fees for merchants until they make $1m worth of sales. Coinbase claims it is doing this to aid the adoption of bitcoin as a payment method by merchants.  ""We wanted to lower all barriers for new merchants to get started, and help highlight some of the economic benefits of accepting bitcoin."" Coinbase said in its latest blog post.  The removal of the transaction fee will clearly appeal to small-scale businesses who don't imagine they will reach $1m in sales for some time. Furthermore, for the larger businesses that will pass that threshold, 1% is still a modest fee compared to those charged by other companies, for example, Visa or MasterCard.  Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Coinbase, said: ""We want to lower all barriers for merchants to start accepting bitcoin. Before, the savings from processing bitcoin payments rather than credit cards were very compelling (1% vs 3%+). Now, they're impossible to ignore.""  We asked whether there was a time limit on this offer, Ehrsam said this was undecided, but that it would definitely run for the ""foreseeable future"". When asked how much the waiving of fees would cost Coinbase, Ehrsam was upbeat: ""It won't really 'cost' the company anything, as we constantly have a nice two-way flow of individuals buying bitcoin on Coinbase, which offsets this natural selling flow well.""  Zach Harvey, co-founder of the Lamassu bitcoin ATM, said: ""I think 0% processing fees for merchants is tremendous, and I expect to see more and more everyday retailers considering bitcoin just because it's a smart business choice. Bitcoin is going in the direction of no longer being a market for idealists, but becoming a payment method with clear advantages of price and security over credit cards.""  Encouraging merchants to adopt bitcoin is clearly necessary. Anyone who has carried bitcoin knows that there are very few places it can actually be spent – although the number is growing slowly but surely. Beccy and Austin Craig, who are currently making the Life on Bitcoin documentary, have been struggling to find merchants in the US who are willing to accept digital currency.  ""Evangelizing bitcoin turns out to feel a lot like a sales job. And I’m remembering how bad I am at direct sales,"" Austin said in a blog posthttp://lifeonbitcoin.com/lifeonbitcoin-day-16-progress-report-frustrations-settling-in/ on day 16 of the challenge.The couple is now making some headway, though, with a gas station attendee recently agreeing to sell them gas for bitcoinshttp://lifeonbitcoin.com/103/. A journalist from Forbes, however, had far less success in getting by on bitcoin alone when she tried doing just this for a week.  Coinbase has made a number of developments of late, recently enabling transactions via SMS, which allows users to send and request bitcoins using simple commands in text messages. Earlier this month, the company also implemented zero-fee micro transactions off the block chain.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/27/coinbase-waives-fees-for-businesses-first-1-million-of-sales,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c7fe9248b6b7a8b497e8a384ec28db8a5bf5f6b6-1000x562.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425071,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqIjh,1377601183,CoinTerra cuts price of TerraMiner IV bitcoin mining rig,"CoinTerra has just announced its official launch and, with this, is cutting the price of its TerraMiner IV product from $15,750 to $13,999. This is a 28nm design that is claimed to achieve 2 TH/sec.  Tuur Demeester, an investment expert and investor in CoinTerra, told us the company has done this in response to ""signals"" from bitcoin miners. Further feedback from miners led CoinTerra to begin working on lower price mining devices in addition to the TerraMiner IV.  We asked CoinTerra CEO, Ravi Iyengar, about the lower-cost devices, but details were not forthcoming: ""We will be announcing the smaller rigs in the near future. I will keep all details for that time.""  Buyer protection program  In addition to the expected TerraMiner IV device, CoinTerra will be announcing its delay protection program. Firstly, the company expects to ship products by December 2013. However, if it does not deliver a confirmed December delivery within 30 days, CoinTerra will credit accounts with 20% extra hashing power.  CoinTerra is also instituting an order exchange system whereby, if a customer needs to abort their order, the company will try to find another customer to take their place in the queue. There is also a price protection policy in place, so if the price of a given product is reduced, that reduction will apply to all undelivered orders too. Customers will have the option of taking a cash refund of the difference or having more hashing power added to their order.  CoinTerra is also offering large batches of chips for miners and OEMs who plan to build their own bitcoin mining rigs. The options for batch sells are as follows:  10 TerraHash package (quantity 20 ASICs guaranteed to be at least 500 GH/sec each) for $57,400 – only $5.74 per GH/sec  25 TerraHash package (quantity 50 ASICs guaranteed to be at least 500 GH/sec each) for $139,750 – only $5.59 per GH/sec  We asked Iyengar why he thought CoinTerra's chip, the GoldStrike1, would be the best on the market. He replied: ""Our team's profile consists of top architects and engineers from some of the top semiconductor companies of the world. We have years of experience in high performance, low power and scalable architectures and have worked on several 28nm designs in the past. We are bringing all that experience to bear on this current project to build the highest performance and most efficient ASIC.""  ""With the launch of CoinTerra, our hope is that we can support the bitcoin community with not only the highest-performance ASICs and rigs on the market, but to further enable the bitcoin network itself with additional security and resilience thanks to the adoption of our bleeding-edge technology,"" he added.  ""It’s not just about making a profit for us, we want to see bitcoin established as a trusted and secure solution for payment – and we intend to be the company that establishes that level of industry transparency and credibility with our customers,"" Iyengar concluded.  Team announcement  As part of its launch, CoinTerra also revealed a previously unannounced member of the team – Dr Timo Hanke. The German mathematician, who has 15 years of research experience, is CoinTerra's lead cryptographer. He gave a presentation about the pay-to-contract protocol at the Bitcoin Foundation San Jose conference in May.  CoinTerra claims it intends to increase the current bitcoin network power by 2 Petahashes per second, which is over four times the current capacity of the whole bitcoin network (487.50 TH/s according to Bitcoin Charts).  According to our round-up of ASIC mining rigs, the TerraMiner IV is matched only by the Butterfly Labs Monarch in its power consumption per GH/s (the energy required to compute a billion hashes), which is due to the 28nm architecture of both chips.  Earlier this month, Cointerra announced Open-Silicon as its “ASIC design and development partner”. Open-Silicon won’t do any of the chip design, but it will be ‘taping out’ the final design for Cointerra before it goes to fabrication partner and AMD spinoff GlobalFoundries, which is the same company fabricating the chips designed by Butterfly Labs.
