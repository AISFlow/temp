37187786,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622331,1733268828,Crypto.com offers hackers $2M to take their best shot at its security system,"Crypto.com recently upgraded its bug bounty program with HackerOne by offering a $2M reward to any hacker able to spot vulnerabilities in its security system. While the bug bounty program with HackerOne is not a novel idea, the large sum attached to the announcement certainly drew a lot of attention worldwide. Crypto.com announced the daring cybersecurity initiative in a blog posted on its website and shared via social media. It is offering hackers the substantial reward of $2M to test the strength of its security system. The company has an ongoing partnership with HackerOne and this cybersecurity program is a part of that partnership. The exchange said it execs the campaign to help bolster security and maintain the trust of its almost 100 million customers. Crypto.com raises the stakes The $2M incentive on offer is one of the largest of its kind in the cryptocurrency sector. Crypto.com confirmed that it is an exercise to prove the importance of proactively safeguarding digital assets in its custody, especially in the cryptocurrency space where cyber threats are surplus. With this program, Crypto.com hopes participants may help identify vulnerabilities and resolve potential risks before they are found and exploited by the wrong people. The company joins other crypto platforms that have put out bug bounties to bolster their defenses against cyber threats. “When you operate a global app serving more than 100 million customers, finding critical security gaps before bad actors do is essential to system integrity and customer trust,” Kara Sprague, CEO of HackerOne said. She went on to say that Crypto.com’s “record breaking bounty” reflects the company’s emphasis on “consumer protection and their appreciation of the value the ethical hacking community can provide.” Strategic bets in the cryptocurrency space Other companies such as Uniswap, Atomic Wallet, Facebook and even Google consistently run bug bounty programs to quickly identify critical gaps in their security before they pose a problem. In late November, Uniswap launched the largest bug bounty in DeFi history, offering a whopping $15.5M reward to hackers who could identify weaknesses in its v4 smart contracts ahead of their deployment. The project’s UNI token has taken off on a parabolic trajectory since it announced the campaign. The crypto space has been rocked by significant cases of hacks on both decentralized protocols and centralized exchanges . Affected entities have had varying degrees of success in recouping and reimbursing stolen funds to affected users. The WazirX and XT.com exchange hacks were major hacks that affected centralized exchanges running on similar business models as Crypto.com this year alone. Crypto.com is not waiting to record losses before making its move. The Chief Information Security Officer of Crypto.com, Jason Lau, stated, “We have always respected and partnered with the ethical hacking community as an extension of our security team. Deepening our relationship with HackerOne through this milestone and setting this landmark bounty underscores our commitment to enhancing safeguards and consumer protection. We look forward to continuing to productively engage with this community.” A Step-By-Step System To Launching Your Web3 Career and Landing High-Paying Crypto Jobs in 90 Days.",POSITIVE,UNI,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | UNI,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/crypto-com-offers-hackers-2m-security-system/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37187786.jpeg

Toncoin’s recent updates have sparked debates about its scalability compared to Ethereum and Solana, while Stellar’s climb toward a 60% surge has everyone watching. But here comes Qubetics, a game-changer in the presale arena, solving real-world issues that have plagued blockchain technologies for years. With over $4.2 million raised in its presale and over 261 million $TICS tokens sold, it’s becoming the talk of the town. In a market overflowing with innovation, Qubetics stands apart. Why? Its revolutionary QubeQode IDE aims to make blockchain accessible, tackling the very problems of complexity and scalability that many users face daily. Let’s dive deeper into these projects and see what makes Qubetics the best ongoing presale to buy now. Qubetics: Redefining Blockchain’s Future Qubetics isn’t just another crypto project. It’s a movement aimed at solving blockchain’s core issues. With its QubeQode IDE , the project is creating a user-friendly ecosystem that anyone—yes, anyone—can navigate. Think about it: how many times have you heard complaints about blockchain’s complexity driving users away? Qubetics addresses this head-on. Blockchain has long been plagued by unintuitive interfaces and limited transaction scalability. These problems make it harder for new users to dive in and for businesses to rely on the technology. QubeQode IDE simplifies blockchain app development, offering tools that reduce complexity and increase accessibility. It’s designed with scalability in mind, ensuring that transaction processing isn’t a bottleneck, even during peak usage. Qubetics is in its 11th presale stage, with a current token price of $0.0282. The project has already raised over $4.2 million, selling more than 261 million $TICS tokens to over 5,900 holders. These figures show strong community trust and investor interest. Analysts predict that the $TICS token’s value could soar post-launch, making it the best ongoing presale to buy now. FOMO kicking in yet? Unlike its competitors, Qubetics doesn’t just patch problems—it reimagines blockchain technology. By making it accessible and scalable, it’s paving the way for mainstream adoption. Imagine a world where developing blockchain apps is as simple as using a smartphone. That’s the future Qubetics is building. Learn more by watching this video . Toncoin: A Rising Star with Room to Shine Toncoin’s recent performance has been impressive. Analysts are debating whether it might outperform Ethereum or Solana in December. Its robust ecosystem, powered by The Open Network, is gaining traction for its speed and decentralised structure. This makes it a go-to for users craving efficiency in transaction processing. But does it have what it takes to revolutionise blockchain accessibility? According to recent forecasts, Toncoin could double in value by year’s end. The coin’s recent upgrades aim to tackle network congestion and scalability issues, bringing it closer to Ethereum’s dominance. However, its complex ecosystem might still pose challenges for newcomers. Crypto experts warn that while Toncoin offers solutions, it’s not foolproof. The learning curve is steep, and its tools are far from intuitive for first-time users. Toncoin’s growth is exciting, but accessibility remains a significant barrier. As it evolves, its ability to onboard everyday users will determine its long-term success. That’s where it could learn a thing or two from Qubetics’ focus on user-friendly tools. Stellar: Aiming for the Stars with Bold Moves Stellar is no stranger to the limelight. Its mission to simplify cross-border payments has won over institutions and investors alike. Recent predictions suggest a 60% jump in its value, driven by its unique position in enabling fast, cost-effective global transactions. With XRP nearing a $2 milestone, Stellar’s competition in this space is heating up. But here’s the rub: Stellar’s infrastructure, while efficient, doesn’t completely erase the hurdles faced by mainstream users. Technical complexities and a lack of streamlined interfaces make it challenging for those new to crypto. Its scalability also has room for improvement, as transaction volumes increase with adoption. Despite these limitations, Stellar’s potential remains undeniable. Its partnerships with financial institutions and a focus on solving real-world payment issues give it an edge. Still, it’s clear that blockchain needs a simpler, more accessible solution—something Qubetics promises to deliver. Conclusion: Where Does the Smart Money Go? Toncoin and Stellar are undoubtedly making waves, with Toncoin’s potential doubling and Stellar’s steady climb. But both projects struggle with accessibility and scalability issues that hinder widespread adoption. They’re excellent investments for seasoned crypto enthusiasts but might leave newcomers scratching their heads. Enter Qubetics. With its innovative QubeQode IDE, it’s solving the very problems that others overlook. Its presale success, intuitive tools, and focus on scalability make it a top contender for anyone looking to invest in blockchain’s future. So, what are you waiting for? Dive into the Qubetics presale and grab your $TICS tokens before it’s too late. Don’t miss out on the best ongoing presale to buy now!

37190283,https://cryptonews.com/?p=315662,1733268600,Ishiba Lukewarm on Japanese Crypto Tax Reform and Bitcoin ETF Approval,"Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has expressed “caution” about scrapping the country’s controversial crypto tax law. Ishiba has also suggested he will not be rushed into approving Bitcoin spot ETFs . Regulators, government ministers, and opposition leaders have united in calls to replace the current system with a flat 20% capital gains levy on annual crypto trading profits. However, the Japanese media outlet CoinPost reported that Ishiba distanced himself from both matters on December 2. Japanese Crypto Tax Reform off The Table? Ishiba made his remarks about crypto tax in response to a question from the (opposition) Democratic Party for the People lawmaker Satoshi Asano. The Prime Minister questioned the “appropriateness” of the government to “recommend investment in cryptoassets in the same way as it does for stocks and investment trusts.” Japan’s New Prime Minister Reorganizes Web3, Crypto Policy Units These traditional financial instruments, he noted, “have investor protection regulations in place,” unlike crypto. He also suggested that the public may not “understand” issues pertaining to the “separate reporting of taxable income.” “Issues like these require careful consideration.” Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba At present, Japanese crypto investors must declare their crypto trading profits on annual tax declarations, where they must file under “other income.” In parliamentary questioning Monday, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba was grilled over issues ranging from the Liberal Democratic Party’s approach to political reform and his stance on social issues to the content of a supplementary budget. https://t.co/aLh55q6Ap7 — The Japan Times (@japantimes) December 2, 2024 This means that – depending on their annual incomes – they can pay anything between 15% and 55% tax on their crypto trading profits. Critics say this is deeply unfair. They claim that Japanese crypto tax law is out of sync with other advanced economies. Most of these nations typically oblige citizens to pay capital gains tax on “realized” crypto trading profits. Ishiba also gave a cagey response when he was quizzed on his stance on crypto ETF approval. He said: “The question of whether or not cryptoassets should be included in ETF offerings needs to be considered based on whether or not we should really strive to make it easier for the public to invest in cryptoassets.” Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda has plenty of data to support the case for raising the benchmark rate in December, an outcome that would mark the first tightening of policy three times in a calendar year since 1989 https://t.co/EpbXpScHYt — Bloomberg (@business) December 3, 2024 Asano remarked that existing rules that “impose a maximum 55% tax in Japan” were “holding” the nation “back.” He claimed they are “causing web3 companies and [capital] to flow out of the country.” Cambodia blocks access to 16 crypto exchange websites https://t.co/CYILxRKj1a — Nikkei Asia (@NikkeiAsia) December 3, 2024 Japan Crypto Tax Law and Bitcoin ETFs: PM Cautious On X (Twitter), Yuichiro Tamaki , the Democratic Party for the People leader, hit out at Ishiba’s stance on the matter. He said Ishiba’s response to the question of crypto tax was “disappointing.” “The PM gave no response to the [crypto tax question]. He is even reluctant to consider crypto asset ETFs. The gap between Japan and the United States, which aims to become a Bitcoin powerhouse, is growing ever wider.” Tamaki Tamaki concluded by asking: “What on Earth has happened to the national strategy of becoming a major power in the web3 sector?” The post Ishiba Lukewarm on Japanese Crypto Tax Reform and Bitcoin ETF Approval appeared first on Cryptonews .",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/japanese-pm-ishiba-lukewarm-on-crypto-tax-reform-and-bitcoin-etf-approval/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37190283.jpeg
37187427,https://thecoinrise.com/namada-launches-native-token-on-mainnet/,1733268517,Namada Launches Native Token on Mainnet,"Namada, a Layer 1 blockchain focused on privacy, has launched its mainnet. According to the announcement , this is an important step in its development. The launch began with the creation of the genesis blocks in the network. The initial phase of the mainnet focuses on staking and governance. This sets up a decentralized network driven by its community. Namada Committed to a User-driven Ecosystem Namada is giving away its native tokens, NAM, through an airdrop to eligible wallets as part of its launch. Recipients can immediately use these tokens to stake and participate in governance decisions. This focus on staking and governance shows Namada’s commitment to a user-driven ecosystem. Notably, the rollout will happen in five phases. Token transferability will start in the fifth phase, which is expected to begin in the next few months. This will only happen once the Namada community is confident of its network. Meanwhile, Namada focuses on privacy by using advanced cryptographic methods to protect transaction details. At the same time, it ensures transparency in governance. IOTA Foundation Revamps Mainnet With Move Transition The IOTA Foundation unveiled IOTA Rebased recently , an ambitious upgrade proposal to revolutionize its blockchain network. IOTA Rebased proposes a complete overhaul of the network’s Layer-1 protocol by switching to a Move-based object ledger. Interestingly, this move makes IOTA the first Layer1 blockchain to adopt the Move Virtual Machine (MoveVM). This transition opens the doors to programmability at the core layer, enabling developers to create Decentralized Applications (DApps). This transformative upgrade also positions IOTA alongside prominent MoveVM-powered blockchains like Sui and Aptos. Meanwhile, the Move programming language will be added to the architecture, allowing smart contracts to run directly on the Layer 1 ledger. Celo Network Moves to Become Ethereum Layer 2 Recall that last year, cLabs, the Celo blockchain’s core developer, presented an ambitious plan to transform its Layer 1 network into a Layer 2 solution built on Ethereum . As revealed, the cLabs proposal outlines a future version of Celo based on a Layer 2 roll-up model. In this model, Celo will leverage Ethereum’s mainnet for security by publishing security proofs. By doing so, Celo can benefit from the robust security guarantees offered by Ethereum, ensuring a higher level of protection than what Celo’s independent infrastructure currently provides.

Bitcoin (BTC) was last around $96,000, whilst other crypto majors like XRP (XRP) , Solana (SOL) and BNB (BNB) saw swings in opposing directions of as much as 10% in 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap . Bitcoin dominance, however, remains in a clear downtrend and, last around 55.6%, is at its lowest since mid-summer. However, the recent uptrend break suggests Bitcoin dominance is set to continue its decline suggesting altcoin season is well and truly here. Whilst that’s great news for major altcoins , the biggest gains will go to as of yet little-known projects that will unexpectedly catch the zeitgeist. That’s why traders flock to the DEX markets in hunt of top crypto gainers today – because they are looking for the next micro-cap coin to explode. Traders often turn to tools such as DEXScreener to find trending coins. Here are some top crypto gainers today that they will be watching. Top Crypto Gainers Today on DEXScreener – Which Are They? Chaos (CHAOS) A new AI meme coin on Base called Chaos (CHAOS), which was spawned by AI agent aixbt, is up 1,300% in the past 24 hours per DEXScreener , making it one of the top crypto gainers today. CHAOS last had a market cap of around $12.5 million, with $2 million in liquidity and nearly $50 million in trading volumes so far. AI is expected to be a major theme this altcoin season, and tokens like CHAOS could be at the forefront of this. The community is certainly very bullish on CHAOS, which currently has 321 rocket ship emoji votes compared to 33 red flag emoji votes. Of course, that doesn’t mean this coin is a safe investment. Nothing is in the on-chain DEX markets. Indeed, most coins end up as pump-and-dump schemes or scams of some sort. Catslap (SLAP) A fun Ethereum meme coin called Catslap (SLAP) is another one of the top crypto gainers today on Tuesday, having rallied 70% in the past 24 hours to a market cap of nearly $60 million. Per DEXScreener, Catslap last had liquidity of around $6.4 million, with $2.4 million in volumes having changed hands in the past 24 hours. The fun slap-to-earn meme coin is getting a lot of attention on socials, with its X page recently surpassing 10,000 followers, suggesting it has plenty of upside potential left in the near future. New ATH Slappers. Get Slapping. Rewards are coming. https://t.co/TnOnOuIV8e pic.twitter.com/wgQC3JNyC3 — Catslap (@CatSlapToken) December 3, 2024 Indeed, it actually ranks as one of crypto news.com ‘s top meme coins to buy right now. Rizzmas (RIZZMAS) Christmas-themed Solana meme coin Rizzmass (RIZZMASS) is up 66% in the past 24 hours, per DEXScreener , making it another top crypto gainer today. The project encourages “acts of kindness” during the season of giving. The meme coin last had a market cap of around $34.5 million, but could see a further build-up in interest as Christmas nears. Perhaps a retest of its recent highs in the $90 million area could be on the cards.

According to developer WietseWind on the social media platform X, XRPL Labs changed the configuration of its validator last month to lower fees and reserve requirements in anticipation of rising activity on-chain. “There have been several discussion threads about Reserves and Fees on the XRPL. On behalf of XRPL Labs I just changed the configuration of our validator, to be enabled the next validator restart.” According to the developer, the adjustments aim to lower barriers for new users, including a significant reduction in the required reserves. As of December 2nd, reserve requirements for XRPL users have now been lowered from 20 to 1 XRP. According to pseudonymous XRPL developer Vet, the move has freed up excess XRP for traders. “XRP Ledger reserves just dropped! Activating an XRP account cost now 1 XRP Holding a Token Trustline only 0.2 XRP Excessive XRP is now freed up in your account that you can spend now!!” Developers say the changes will make it more affordable for users to participate in the XRP Ledger ecosystem, thus broadening the blockchain’s user base. Ripple CTO David Schwartz also asked validators to upgrade to 2.3.0 of rippled, the reference server implementation of the XRP Ledger. The move comes at a time when XRP’s value has soared to $2.65, its highest level since 2018. XRP is worth $2.51 at time of writing, up 82% from a week ago.

The cryptocurrency had its biggest 24-hour gain in the last month, which boosted its market capitalization to $44.7 billion. Now, investors have begun talking about whether this momentum can be sustained, or if the rally has just been a temporary burst.

Experts are keenly observing the token as optimism about the broader crypto market grows. Bullish Predictions Fuel Market Hopes Crypto analyst Javon Marks thinks ADA has more to go. On December 1, Marks presented a price target of $2.77, or 130% above its current value. He also suggested that ADA could go the same way as it did in 2021 and surge between $5.29 and $7.82. Lark Davis, another prominent analyst, went even further and predicted that ADA would jump by 747% to $10. $ADA (Cardano) continuing to display monumental strength here and can be in full pursuit towards the first target of $2.7709 which can result in another +135% move from here to reach it but history says there can be more 👀! See charts below… https://t.co/OXkUPU1un4 pic.twitter.com/VOCZMOTo5Q — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) December 1, 2024 Institutional support is further giving the bull case credibility. The CIO at Morgan Creek Capital, Mark Yusko, recently stated that Cardano was one of his top altcoin choices for 2024. According to Yusko, traditional banks will be forced to introduce cryptocurrencies like ADA in the future to maintain their status quo. Resistance & Support Levels Under Focus While the rally is exciting, technical analysts suggest caution. The altcoin recently failed to break past the resistance level of $1.15, which raises questions about whether the uptrend can hold. Analysts point out that ADA must decisively reclaim this resistance to sustain its bullish momentum. If ADA succeeds in breaking through and holding up above $1.15, it could open a fresh wave of buying to carry the price even higher. If it fails, there could be a pullback to some critical support levels around $0.88. Related Reading: Cardano To Hit $10? Analyst Thinks It’s Happening This Cycle Broader Market Trends Could Boost ADA Cardano is just seeing its surge as the overall crypto market is filled with fresh momentum. Bitcoin is approaching $100,000 and the recently held US presidential election brings much-needed optimism for the introduction of friendlier policies to cryptos. The positive context will therefore become a tailwind for ADA and other altcoins. Meanwhile, Cardano plans to release 18.53 million ADA tokens on December 4, which are worth approximately $20 million, adding to its momentum. An increase in supply can be viewed as dilution; however, the funds will go towards staking and treasury reserves, which may boost long-term growth. At present, Cardano seems to be on the bright side of things, but the future depends on breaking some key resistance levels and holding investor confidence.

With this move, the firm intends to stop accepting Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) for payments.

Dtcpay, founded in 2019, is one of the key players in fintech, earning support from major industries like Singapore’s Pontiac Land. The company received a payment license from Singapore’s central bank in 2022. Dtcpay’s shift to stablecoins The shift also comes amid the growing demand for stable, secure, and regulated payment options. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum can have big price changes, which create risks for businesses and users. Stablecoins, which are tied to traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar, offer a more predictable and stable alternative for digital transactions. Dtcpay believes this move will make payments safer and easier for everyone. Dtcpay’s decision is part of a larger trend in the fintech industry. A report from Chainalysis shows that stablecoin payments in Singapore reached nearly $1 billion in the second quarter of 2024. Dtcpay will only support certain stablecoins like Tether’s USDt (USDT), Circle’s USD Coin (USDC), First Digital USD (FDUSD), and Worldwide USD (WUSD). These stablecoins are backed by real reserves to keep them at a 1:1 value with the U.S. dollar. FDUSD, launched in June 2023, is now the sixth-largest stablecoin with a market value of $1.9 billion. WUSD, backed by the Worldwide Stablecoin Payment Network, is known for its added security since it is fully backed by reserves. The Singapore firm noted that the new stablecoin-only model aligns with its mission to deliver a “more reliable, scalable, and secure payment experience” for its clients. The platform’s commitment to stability is important in the financial ecosystem. A large part of their transactions is already done with stablecoins. This change also aligns with growing regulations in places like Singapore, where the government is setting clear rules for digital assets.

Donald vs Israel (DONISRA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONISRA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Donald vs Israel can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald vs Israel could become the next viral memecoin. Donald vs Israel launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Donald vs Israel on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald vs Israel by entering its contract address – CKYA6Q1KcWsSJyXgFKwyNXyTAjHD1dRPKTDD2FTUFryn – in the receiving field.

Final Collection and Legacy Tribute “Today, we’re announcing the plan to wind down RTFKT operations,” the post stated. “Looking back, we’re incredibly proud of everything we’ve achieved together.” RTFKT also outlined plans to release a final collection in December, the MNLTH X, featuring the BLADE DROP before its closure. The team described this move as a testament to its dedication to innovation and the merging of physical and digital realms. Reflecting on its achievements, the company highlighted its role at the forefront of digital culture, pioneering the integration of the sneaker lifestyle, gaming, digital fashion, and Web3 technology. The statement also highlighted its major contributions, including the Clone X collaboration with renowned artist Takashi Murakami, the development of digital footwear that transformed into physical products, and its support for 3D artists and digital creators. To preserve its legacy, the company announced plans to launch an updated website to showcase its most impactful projects.

In December 2021, Nike took it over , with then-CEO John Donahoe describing the move as pivotal to accelerating the sports gear maker’s digital transformation. The two companies then partnered on various sneaker collections, even creating custom designs worn by NBA superstar LeBron James during the 2023 playoffs.

In a Tuesday hearing before U.S District Judge John Koeltl, Mashinsky agreed to the plea deal on charges of commodities fraud and manipulating the price of Celsius’ own token, CEL. The plea comes after Mashinsky was indicted in July 2023 for seven counts of fraud, conspiracy, and market manipulation. The prosecutors accused him of defrauding investors and manipulating the value of CEL. At first, Mashinsky pled not guilty, but when the trial date was set for January 2024, he took the plea agreement. Celsius’ bankruptcy and crypto sector fallout Celsius was launched in 2017 and initially offered higher yields to crypto owners and bought tokens from institutional investors. However, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 2022 after many customers withdrew their money in response to a crash in the price of cryptocurrencies. The company’s activities resumed in January 2023 after coming out of bankruptcy and ventured into Bitcoin mining. Celsius was not immune to the general collapse of the cryptocurrency market in 2022. The rising interest rates and high inflation rate pushed the digital asset price down and put major companies like Three Arrows Capital, Voyager Digital, and FTX out of business. The federal prosecutors also accused Mashinsky and Celsius’ former Chief Revenue Officer Roni Cohen-Pavon of manipulating the price of CEL. Cohen-Pavon had pleaded guilty in September 2023 and agreed to participate in the investigations. The prosecutors claim that Mashinsky personally gained $42m from the sale of the CEL tokens. New SEC leadership could shape the future of crypto Since the crash in 2022, the cryptocurrency market has made a comeback. This has been boosted by the win of President-elect Donald Trump, who is expected to support crypto-friendly policies. As reported by Cryptopolitan , Trump reportedly offered the post of the SEC chair to Paul Atkins who is a known crypto supporter. The current SEC Chair, Gary Gensler is set to resign on January 20th, 2025, which is the same day Trump will be inaugurated. Mashinsky along with many others has been charged for fraud in the recent past following the market collapse. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was convicted in November 2023 for the wire fraud of $8 billion from customers and was sentenced to 25 years in jail.

The report finds a rare “golden cross” signal in the SOPR Ratio indicator. The indicator reportedly appears only once or twice during a bull market, which could push Bitcoin price to new heights by early 2025. Bitcoin price set to rise in 1-2 months Bitcoin price is expected to rise sharply within the next 1-2 months , according to research by CryptoQuant . According to analyst Crypto Dan, the “golden cross” signal of the SOPR Ratio indicator has appeared. The ratio indicates a bull market and tracks profits and losses in Bitcoin transactions. The analyst explains, “This signal occurs only once or twice in the entire upward cycle, and it is the second positive signal in the current upward cycle that started in January 2023.” Historically, Bitcoin price surged within two months of the signal appearance. Since this is the second time this signal has appeared in the current market cycle, the rise could be steep. Strong rise in #Bitcoin is expected within 1-2 months “This signal occurs only once or twice in the entire upward cycle, and it is the second positive signal in the current upward cycle that started in January 2023.” – By @DanCoinInvestor Full post 👇 https://t.co/pFpGEAnAOh pic.twitter.com/cvZnXCs4Fh — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 2, 2024 The analyst says that in the later stages, the price increases tend to become larger and corrections are shorter. If the surge happens as predicted, more money and new investors would help with the price rise . Which in turn can reportedly push Bitcoin to its peak price by late 2024 or early 2025. Meanwhile, another signal will make the investors optimistic about Bitcoin price. The amount of Bitcoin held on exchanges, given by exchange reserves, is at a record low while the BTC price is at a record-high range. BTC exchange flows signal Bitcoin price rise | Source:CryptoQuant The charts show the 7-day moving average has been decreasing over time. These figures haven’t been seen in between 2022 and 2024 until now. In simple terms, the SMA hints at fewer Bitcoins for investors. Since there is a supply shortage, less BTC will be available for trading or selling on these exchanges. Bumper Q4 for Bitcoin Bitcoin price has been consistently rising in Q4 2024 and almost inched to breach the $100,000 level. With prices going up and exchange reserves going down, the demand for Bitcoin is a strong bullish indicator. This also means that people might be buying and moving their Bitcoins off exchanges to ‘ hodl .’ The weekly asset flow report by CoinShares revealed strong inflows since early September. Bitcoin only recently lost its momentum briefly . The report says that investors have withdrawn $457 million in the last week, likely an indicator of profit-taking. The Bitcoin Relative Strength Index (RSI) also indicates the momentum since September. By the end of October, the RSI started rising above 70, signaling an overbought market condition. After reaching the peak of around 84, the RSI began to fall. However, 14 close average remains around 70 at the time of writing. This again indicates resilient demand. There are macro factors also behind this surge. In a recent piece, Dr Thomas Gift from UCL Political Science stated , “Aside from politicians’ promises, a number of other reasons explain why many bitcoiners are poising themselves for a Trump-fuelled bull run.” He circles on continued money printing by the Fed, expected crypto clarity through Trump’s election victory and institutional adoption as reasons for Bitcoin price rise. While some investors have already taken profits, the market is unhinged and even more fueled, setting the stage for Bitcoin to reach its peak in this cycle.

37185889,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622302,1733264946,Ripple meme tokens try to compete with the Solana ecosystem,"After the XRP rally above $2.60, the primary token was not enough. The Ripple army is now trying to build a native meme token ecosystem. XRP has spawned another gold rush – this time, to create meme tokens on the Ripple protocol. The new wave of XRP-based tokens started in early November, and assets are now trying to gain traction. The rush to meme tokens coincided with the expansion of XRP, which still trades at $2.64. The recent launch of meme tokens took only a few weeks, showing projects are moving fast when there is a sign of potential liquidity. The meme platform is modeled after Pump.fun, but it taps the resilient Ripple army. All tokens exist on the XRP Ledger, or XRPL. XRP has been known for its community of dedicated holders, which are now testing the revival of year-old meme tokens, in addition to new launches. The major platform for Ripple-based tokens is First Ledger, where currently a few new assets are created each day. XRPL memes are extremely risky Even established meme tokens are comparatively volatile. On XRPL, even the most liquid assets are trading at a fraction of the price and liquidity for Ethereum or Solana memes. At the same time, long-term XRP holders are taking some measured risk, in a bid to tap the upside of a successful meme. XRPL memes trade against XRP, with long-term holders using their tokens as play money. XRPL memes have significant drawdowns, and are mostly traded as extremely risky assets with no locked liquidity. | Source: First Ledger Drawdowns of nearly 80% are not unusual, as most tokens are experimental. Despite this, a month into the XRPL meme frenzy, the assets received their own DexScreener page. The current selection of memes on XRPL is a mix of older assets, created in 2023 or even 2022, and new memes launched in the last few hours. ARMY leads the XRPL meme trend ARMY is an asset launched a year ago, which is having another moment in the spotlight. Riffing on the Ripple army meme, ARMY is the most liquid of tokens. Even at the top, ARMY has $2.6M in liquidity and a market capitalization of $40.5M, similar to a minor Ethereum or Solana meme. Despite the low volumes, ARMY managed to rally from $0.006 to a peak of $0.16, helping to bring more attention to the new meme opportunity. PHNIX is a more recent token, created in the last 24 hours, which survived its first day on First Ledger. The asset accrued $200K in liquidity and managed to eat a whooping 15 zeroes from its price, to trade at $0.0000041. It is precisely this potential for expansion that is making traders choose early bets among XRPL memes. PHNIX is one of the growing memes on XRPL, surviving its first days of trading. | Source: Dexscreener There is one big problem with XRPL meme tokens – all of their assets have their liquidity unlocked. Trading on the XRPL protocol has no mechanism to lock liquidity as it is usually done on Uniswap or Raydium. This means there is still no way to check if a token has at least some reassurance in the case of a rug pull. First Ledger receives immediate VC backing The immediate effect of the meme frenzy is that First Ledger started to attract potential VC backing. Victus Capital, a small Tier 4 fund, picked the XRPL market for its future potential. For now, there is no commitment to invest funds, but Victus has shown readiness to support ecosystem projects. XRPL has promised to replace traditional transactions, including banking. For now, the distributed ledger has lagged behind the wider DeFi and token ecosystem. XRPL tokens are still niche, and are now trying to grasp the chance of standing out. XRPL DEX is the only other trading hub for the protocol. The DEX had minimal volumes, just before the breakout of new token launches. As a result, XRPL DEX increased its value locked to $67.62M, up from months of holding just around $12M. Even if memes are short-lived, they are showing the potential of XRP to build a wider ecosystem. The token is still a paradox, with extreme exposure among top assets, but limited external utility. XRP itself has no official utility, but can be used for liquidity in a decentralized ecosystem, boosting its value similar to Solana.

Table of Contents Solana’s downtrend affects its market value Ripple becomes 3rd largest crypto IntelMarkets soars to new peak Conclusion In a surprising turn of events, Ripple (XRP) took the position of the 3rd largest cryptocurrency, surpassing Solana (SOL) and USDT. Additionally, IntelMarkets (INTL) pushed its gains by over 600%, setting a new ATH at $0.064091. Solana’s downtrend affects its market value Over the past week, the price movement of Solana has been underwhelming. CoinMarketCap price information reveals the Solana price dropped 11.2% during this period. This downtrend affected its position in the crypto market, pushing it to the 5th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Solana’s market cap is now consolidating between $122 billion and $107 billion. Many analysts suggest that the Solana coin price could drop to $200 if the bearish pressure remains. However, in the meantime, Solana’s 14-Day RSI is above the midline, which signifies the presence of bulls. Ripple becomes 3rd largest crypto Ripple surged by more than 25% during the Thanksgiving weekend, smashing the $2 mark on Sunday. The DeFi cryptocurrency has been building on an uptrend which started last month. Data from CoinMarketCap shows the market cap of the Ripple token rose from $75 billion to $140 billion to become the third-largest digital currency.

37185713,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622240,1733264158,ChatGPT finally says ‘David Mayer’ but fail on 5 names amid AI lawsuits,"Artificial intelligence (AI) tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT can perform several functions, but users occasionally discover glitches. Recently, reports surfaced that ChatGPT stopped functioning when asked about certain names, like David Mayer. The community now questions the model’s handling of sensitive or legally complex data. We can wait for AI tools to address more privacy concerns amid several lawsuits. ChatGPT doesn’t reveal who David Mayer is OpenAI’s ChatGPT reportedly stopped working when asked about specific names last weekend. TechCrunch cited users reporting a no-go list of names, which included “David Mayer,” that made the chatbot freeze or crash without responding. When Cryptopolitan checked how the chatbox based on the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) language model responded on Tuesday, the results were similar but not quite the same. Here’s how ChatGPT responded to a query about David Mayer It turns out that David Mayer is no more a forbidden name. According to ChatGPT-4o, Mayer is quite a common name, although , it couldn’t specify the person. When asked about the earlier glitch, ChatGPT brushed it off saying” I see what you’re referring to! There may have been instances where glitches or errors occurred with formatting, spelling, or content generation, but nothing specifically tied to consistently misspelling the name ‘David Mayer.’ It also recommended reporting ‘odd and inconsistent’ responses. Other names—Brian Hood, Jonathan Turley, Jonathan Zittrain, David Faber, and Guido Scorza—caused the system to malfunction over the weekend and again on Tuesday when we checked. OpenAI might be handling sensitive data differently-Report The report finds that these names belong to public or semi-public figures, such as journalists, lawyers, or people who may have been involved in privacy or legal disputes with OpenAI. For instance, the individual named Hood was reportedly misrepresented by ChatGPT in the past, leading to legal discussions with OpenAI. Lawsuits have piled up on AI companies TechCrunch guesses that OpenAI might be cautious about the list of names to handle sensitive or legally protected information differently. It could possibly be to comply with privacy laws or legal agreements. However, a code malfunction might cause the chatbot to fail whenever information is sought on the names mentioned. Over the years, several cases were pursued between AI companies for either generating incorrect information or breaching data privacy framework . In a 2020 case, Janecyk v. International Business Machines, photographer Tim Janecyk claimed that IBM improperly used photographer-clicked images for research purposes without consent. Not so long back, Google’s Gemini AI faced criticism for its image-generation capabilities which led to its temporary suspension. In the PM v. OpenAI LP class action lawsuit filed in 2023, OpenAI was accused of using “stolen private information” without consent. In 2024, Indian news agency ANI reportedly filed a lawsuit against OpenAI for using the media company’s copyrighted material to train the LLM. As AI tools become increasingly integrated into daily life, incidents like these underscore the importance of ethical and legal considerations in their development. Whether it’s safeguarding privacy, ensuring accurate information, or avoiding malfunctions tied to sensitive data, companies like OpenAI face the task of building trust while refining their technology. These challenges remind us that even the most advanced AI systems require ongoing vigilance to address technical, ethical, and legal complexities.

Polymarket Bettors Make Microsoft Shareholders’ Prediction According to the official Polymarket poll , Microsoft will vote on the Bitcoin investment plan on December 10. However, only 10 percent of Polymarket bettors who voted on the poll say that shareholders of the Washington-based tech conglomerate will support its passage. “Why should they invest 1% in BTC if their stock could skyrocket 50% because of it,” one Polymarket user commented on the poll. “MSFT stock is in a long consolidation, and BTC adoption is a mega bullish driver for Microsoft.” “If institutional investors want bitcoin exposure, why wouldn’t they just buy bitcoin,” said another. “They’re just making their value assessment more difficult by muddying up safe investments (MSFT) with volatile ones (BTC).” Michael Saylor Urges Bitcoin Investment The issue of whether or not the Bill Gates-founded organization should adopt cryptocurrencies as part of its long-term investment strategy stems from the National Center for Public Policy Research ’s October proposal arguing that the company should invest in the cryptocurrency. Saylor has since taken up the cause of persuading Microsoft to invest in the Satoshi Nakamoto-created cryptocurrency, posting his pitch to company shareholders and CEO Satya Nadella to X on December 1.

The Virginia-headquartered company has since surpassed the entire S&P 500 and is up nearly 500% this year alone. Michael Saylor shared his optimistic outlook on Bitcoin during a recent CNBC interview amid the company’s rapid buyup of the cryptocurrency. “We’re making $500 million a day,” Saylor said. “I’m staring at my screen, and we’re selling dollar bills for $3, sometimes a million times a minute.” Just this week, MicroStrategy purchased 15,400 more Bitcoin worth $1.5 billion, with the business’ stockpile of the token surpassing 400,000. As of Tuesday afternoon, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $95,000, though Saylor has expressed that he believes the cryptocurrency will soon hit the $100,000 mark. “I’m planning the $100,000 party,” Saylor recently told CNBC .

With this purchase, the company now owns over 400,000 Bitcoins, purchased at an average price of $58,000 per Bitcoin. Saylor explained that MicroStrategy’s approach involves leveraging traditional financial instruments like equity issuance and convertible debt to fund Bitcoin purchases. “We are a Bitcoin treasury company,” Saylor said. “Our mission is to securitize Bitcoin and bridge the gap between traditional capital markets and the crypto economy.” “Bitcoin is the only commodity in human history that has been invented that is strictly capped,” Saylor said. “The fact that it outperforms the S&P 500 and is more volatile makes it an attractive asset for investors looking for high performance.” Related News: Here's the Top 10 AI Altcoins Developers Have Focused on in the Last Month Saylor also argued that Bitcoin’s volatility is a feature, not a flaw, allowing traders and investors to take advantage of market fluctuations. Saylor likened volatility to fire, saying, “Henry Ford put fire in an engine and created an industry. Bitcoin’s volatility gives humanity wings in the financial markets.” He predicted that price volatility would continue, suggesting that Bitcoin could “peak and rise to $180,000” before experiencing significant corrections and falling to $140,000. *This is not investment advice.

37186223,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51209,1733263212,"BTC Price Breaks Above $97,000, But Experts Think ETH Will Lead December With Altcoin Frenzy","In the last 24 hours, the BTC price has again surpassed the $97,000 high in an attempt to break above $100k. While the BTC price is gearing up for the next leg, experts think ETH could lead to the next uptrend. In the last few weeks, spot Ethereum ETFs have recorded positive inflow, which could support the ETH price. Other potential ERC-20 altcoins, like DTX Exchange (DTX) , are also expected to perform extraordinarily. DTX Exchange has seen rapid developments recently, and the launch is coming soon, after which DTX token price can skyrocket. BTC Price Stabilizes Above $95,000 With 10 DMA Support The BTC price made the recent high of $99,860 on 22nd November; afterward, it traded in a converging triangle pattern with resistance at $98,500. On 26th November, it made an undercut on 10 days moving average but quickly rose above average and has been surfing above it since then. With the consolidation of the BTC price, the volume has dipped below the average in the last three days. This volume action indicates volatility decreasing in the consolidation phase. Volatility contraction patterns usually break out after the dryness in volume, which can be observed in the BTC price. If Bitcoin breaks down upside, it can achieve the $100,000 target for the first time. Spot Ethereum ETFs Achieve Historic Single-Day High Spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. have gained significant traction and delivered strong performance over the past week. They wrapped up November on a high note, marking spot Ethereum ETF’s best 30-day stretch since launch. This growing investor confidence also boosted ETH’s price, which crossed $3,500 for the first time since July. According to SoSoValue’s latest market data, U.S.-based spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a net inflow of $333 million on Friday. This set a new single-day record, surpassing the previous high of $295 million on November 11. Spot Ethereum ETF inflows have surpassed Bitcoin inflows for the first time since ETFs began trading. This shift could signal something deeper and more significant than it appears at first glance. DTX Exchange Becomes The Perfect Platform For Portfolio Diversification, Including ETFs Investors seeking diversification in different asset classes and instruments with different aggressive or defensive strategies can now choose DTX’s multi-asset trading platform . DTX Exchange includes all the liquid assets for investment, and users can easily find popular assets like stocks, crypto, forex, etc. The major attraction for investors has been investing in various large-cap crypto ETFs, which provide consistent returns with less risk. The 1,000x leverage features make them more beneficial because, with small funds, you can make large positions and generate consistent income. DTX Exchange’s presale is in stage 6, and the token is priced at $0.12. The project has raised over $9 million with 17,200 holders of DTX tokens. DTX holders will also enjoy huge discounts on trading fees on the platform. DTX tokens have the potential to grow at an exponential rate, which makes a great opportunity for retail traders.

37185144,https://thecoinrise.com/bitcoin-exchange-reserves-drops-massively-cryptoquant/,1733263039,Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Drops Massively: CryptoQuant,"Blockchain analytics platform CryptoQuant has reported a significant dip in Bitcoin exchange reserves. The drop marks the lowest level the reserve has seen in a very long time. Also, it reduces the volume of BTC available for immediate sales. Bitcoin Investors Holds Coin Long-term On the brighter side, this situation suggests increasing investor confidence in holding the cryptocurrency long-term. CryptoQuant claimed that more than 171,000 BTC have left major cryptocurrency exchanges since November 5, when Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. The trend indicates that investors are moving their holdings to cold storage. This could be part of a long-term strategy. The fall of exchange reserves began in 2021 and has since registered a gradual plunge. As of three years ago, Bitcoin reserves were at about 3.2 million but have now fallen to a multi-year low of 2.46 million coins. BTC Price Sees Slight Dip According to Glassnode data, its illiquid supply metric, BTC held by long-term investors not actively trading, has increased by 185,000 Bitcoin within the last 30 days. Based on this spike, it has reached an All-time-high (ATH) of 14.8 million coins. This covers 75% of the current circulating supply of around 19.79 million coins. Amid a supply crunch, the expected outcome is a price rally, but BTC price has plunged by about 2% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin is down by 1.12% and currently trading at $95,223.11. What Happens Next for Bitcoin? The sudden fluctuations have triggered some anti-BTC individuals to air their views about the future of the digital currency. A few days ago, renowned commodity trader Peter Brandt boldly stated that Bitcoin’s future growth trajectory might not make young investors rich . He based his statement on the fact that as Bitcoin matures, its growth potential may slow down. In under 24 hours, 219,647 traders have been liquidated, total liquidations at $628.32 million, per Coinglass data. Only Bitcoin accounts for $92.44 million of this liquidation, although the most significant outflow was from long positions overshooting their bet on the potential price of the coin.

37185024,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622231,1733262922,Will Sam Altman collaborate with Trump on AI?,"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is backing President-elect Donald Trump, hoping his leadership will help the U.S. stay ahead in the race to develop artificial intelligence. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, supports President-elect Donald Trump and believes his administration will push advancements in AI, keeping the U.S. ahead of rivals like China. Other tech leaders also share similar views by highlighting the importance of America leading in technology. Sam Altman supports Trump’s role in AI leadership In a recent Fox News Sunday interview, Altman stressed the need for strong AI infrastructure, like powerful computers, advanced chips, and large data centers, to stay at the forefront of this technology. “We need to build that here and have the best AI infrastructure in the world,” Altman said. “I believe President-elect Trump will be very good at that.” The OpenAI CEO described this moment as critical, with AI ready to transform industries and societies. He emphasized the need for America and its allies to lead this, ensuring AI is developed with democratic values. “This is an unusually important moment in the history of technology,” Altman said, adding that “The U.S. must lead this effort.” Altman’s idea of advancement is after Trump’s victory, and he raised a talk about partnerships between the new administration and Silicon Valley. Recently, tech leaders like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have also shown interest in working with Trump. Zuckerberg recently visited Trump’s Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, to discuss opportunities, while Musk has been vocal about U.S. technological leadership. Both have expressed openness to collaborating with the administration. Thus, Altman and Musk have a complicated history. Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI, left the organization and later criticized Altman’s leadership. Now, Musk is in charge of Trump’s Chief Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Altman is also hopeful about Trump’s approach to AI, but he also sees the challenges of dealing with regulations. Vice President-elect JD Vance has raised concerns that big companies like OpenAI and Meta might use regulations to strengthen their position and block smaller competitors. Altman disagrees with this, saying it’s important to encourage innovation from smaller companies. He pointed out that the U.S. has a unique ability to lead in innovation and that regulations should not stop smaller companies from growing, as they are often the ones driving important breakthroughs. Building strong AI infrastructure for the future The OpenAi co-founder is excited about AI’s potential to change industries, like improving medical diagnoses and offering personalized tutoring, but he also sees some downsides. He warned that AI could replace some jobs, although it might make other jobs more efficient. “Some jobs will improve, but others will disappear,” he said. He also expressed concerns about bad actors using AI for harmful purposes, like hacking or creating security threats, stressing the importance of developing AI ethically and securely. Countries like Singapore, Japan, and Switzerland are making progress in crypto and AI regulations, which helps legitimize these industries. Altman sees this regulatory progress as key to long-term growth and innovation. Even with the political and industry challenges, Altman is focused on ensuring that AI development follows democratic values and benefits society. His partnership with Trump’s administration is based on their shared goal of building the infrastructure and policies needed to keep America ahead in AI . Altm an said, “The United States and our allies need to lead this.” With Trump at the helm, Altman is betting on a vision of AI that strengthens America’s position as a global leader in technology.

37184488,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98311,1733262126,Bitcoin Mining Giant Acquires Huge 240 Megawatt Texan Wind Farm,"Major Bitcoin mining firm Mara Holdings (formerly Marathon Digital) has reportedly bought a major wind farm in Texas to help charge its mining ambitions. The Florida-registered company is one of the biggest crypto mining facilities in the world and is looking to keep expanding aggressively despite tough mining conditions after the 2024 halving. The company filed this acquisition with the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Mara’s Massive Foray into Wind Energy The company announced this move earlier today but didn’t disclose the amount involved in purchasing the large wind farm. The Hansford county-based farm reportedly boasts a massive 240 Megawatt (MW) worth of interconnectivity and 114 MW wind power generation capacity. The company will likely use this power for mining purposes or in the booming carbon credits market. The facility was previously owned by National Grid Plc and Washington State Investment Board. The move presents a nice PR opportunity for the Bitcoin community as it shows that energy-intensive crypto-mining operations are moving towards renewable energy sources. In addition to this costly facility, Mara Holdings owns around 34,959 BTC ($3.3 billion), among the largest declared ownerships of Bitcoin in the world. However, it is a mining company, so its coffers change considerably with the overall climate. Bitcoin’s Shift to Renewable Energy? While 240 MW is a substantial amount of energy when it comes to household usage, it is minuscule in terms of the overall energy usage of the Bitcoin network. Operating at full capacity, the Texan farm purchased by Mara Holdings can generate about 7 gigawatt hours of energy in a year, while the total energy approximately consumed by the BTC network is reportedly anywhere between 120,000-160,000 gigawatt hours or 120-160 TWh. However, it is still a step in the right direction, as BTC’s environmental impact is routinely blamed for the climate crisis. This is even though several studies have shown that cryptocurrency is responsible for less than 1% of the world’s Carbon emissions, and they, too, are decreasing with time. Bitcoin is trading just above the $95k support level at press time. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization remains on course for a massive 2024-2025 bull market, and miners are expected to hold the crypto in place until their price targets are achieved.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-mining-giant-acquires-huge-240-megawatt-texan-wind-farm/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

This step taken by the company is revolutionary as it makes the company the first to embrace the use of cryptocurrency in the travel industry. Travelers can now pay with Bitcoin for cruises aboard Virgin Voyages’ ships, including the upcoming “Annual Pass.” The Annual Pass allows travelers to book a cruise as many times as they wish in a year. At $120,000, excluding taxes and fees, the pass provides access to premium sea terraces. The acceptance of Bitcoin is in line with the company’s effort to target young travelers who use cryptocurrencies due to their ease and accessibility. The company’s current fleet, which consists of ships such as Scarlet Lady and Valiant Lady, targets millennials with shorter itineraries and focuses on the Caribbean and modern facilities and features onboard. Accepting Bitcoin payments makes it even more attractive to millennial and Gen Z travelers. While other travel platforms such as Travala have allowed for cryptocurrency booking for hotels and flights, Virgin Voyages is the first to introduce the same for cruises. Bitcoin’s increasing institutional interest Virgin Voyages accepting Bitcoin is timely given that the cryptocurrency is celebrating a year of major achievements. There has been heightened institutional interest in Bitcoin as big-name institutions such as BlackRock and Fidelity are backing spot Bitcoin ETFs. This institutional acceptance has made Bitcoin gain credibility as a mainstream investment commodity. Also, firms such as MicroStrategy have remained aggressive in their Bitcoin buying spree. The firm purchased 15,400 BTC for $1.5 billion recently. The company now owns 402,100 BTC, which is approximately 2% of all the BTC in the market. MicroStrategy’s holdings are currently worth $38.2 billion at the current price of $95,000 per token. Likewise, Bitcoin mining company MARA Holdings (MARA) has also j oined the accumulation bandwagon. During the month of October to November MARA purchased 6,484 BTC for a total of $618.3 million. As of November 30, the total amount of Bitcoin held by MARA was 34,959 BTC, worth $3.3 billion. At the national level, countries are considering using Bitcoins. El Salvador is still persistently buying Bitcoin and in the United States, the discussions are steering around President-elect Trump’s idea of having Bitcoin reserves. Meanwhile, Poland and Suriname are working to establish Bitcoin as an essential asset for their respective countries.

Santa Pepe (SANPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Pepe by entering its contract address – 2NefXDdBhUkVn7dXW5wxVtCHKHKE8uiRGUqZGxT5HAN8 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANPEPE.

It’s a 16-stage spectacle that’s already 25% complete, raising over $700,000 in record time. The coin’s ecosystem is a major draw, featuring a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game and a staking rewards program designed to keep investors engaged and rewarded. Let’s talk numbers. If you invested $4,000 at Stage 6’s current price of $0.000058, you’d snag around 68,965,517 BTFD coins. When the coin hits its listing price of $0.0006, that investment could balloon to $41,379.31. Nearly a tenfold return—how’s that for explosive potential? But it’s not just about ROI. BTFD Coin has captured the imagination of a meme-hungry generation with its bold branding and community-first ethos. Social media is ablaze with memes, FOMO posts, and high-energy debates, making BTFD Coin not just an investment but a cultural phenomenon. With 10 stages left to go, the time to jump on this rocket is now. Book of Meme: The Creative Catalyst If there’s one thing that sets Book of Meme apart, it’s creativity. This unique project has carved out its niche by offering a platform where users can create and share memes, earning rewards for their contributions. It’s not just a coin; it’s a community of creators, united by their love for internet culture. The best crypto presales often focus on innovation, and Book of Meme delivers in spades. Its presale rewards early adopters with bonuses and exclusive features, setting the stage for organic growth. The developers understand the power of community, hosting regular events and interactive sessions that encourage participation and build loyalty. But what’s the real appeal here? For many, it’s the promise of combining financial gains with creative expression. As meme culture continues to dominate online spaces, Book of Meme is well-positioned to attract investors looking for both fun and profitability. Analysts predict significant appreciation as the platform gains traction among meme enthusiasts. Does Book of Meme have the explosive growth potential of BTFD Coin? Maybe not. But it’s a standout project for those who value creativity and community engagement. If you’ve ever wanted to earn crypto while flexing your creative muscles, this might just be your calling. Ponke: The Meme Coin Wildcard If Ponke were a person, it’d be that one friend who shows up late to the party, steals the spotlight, and leaves everyone talking. This meme coin thrives on chaos, humour, and unpredictability, appealing to a crowd that loves the absurd side of crypto. Unlike the polished ecosystems of BTFD Coin and Book of Meme, Ponke takes a more… unconventional approach. Its mascot is hilariously whimsical, and its marketing campaigns are equal parts eccentric and brilliant. The coin’s unpredictable tokenomics add to the intrigue, drawing in risk-tolerant investors who thrive on speculation. But is Ponke a serious contender in the race for the best crypto presales? It depends on what you’re looking for. If you’re after clear roadmaps and robust ecosystems, Ponke might not be your jam. But if you want to be part of a community that embraces chaos and thrives on hype, Ponke delivers in spades. Recent surges in trading volume suggest that Ponke’s fans are putting their money where their memes are. However, long-term investors may hesitate without more solid fundamentals. Still, Ponke proves that not every meme coin has to play by the rules. It’s absurdly entertaining and undeniably fun—a reminder that crypto can still surprise and delight. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, the meme coin ecosystem is buzzing with opportunities this December. BTFD Coin leads the pack with its record-breaking presale and massive ROI potential. Book of Meme offers a refreshing take on creativity and community engagement, making it a standout choice for meme enthusiasts. And Ponke? It’s the wildcard, proving that chaos and humour still have a place in the world of crypto. For investors looking to get in on the action, now’s the time to make your move. Join the BTFD Coin presale today , or explore Book of Meme and Ponke to find the project that speaks to you. The meme coin revolution isn’t just happening—it’s thriving.

37183857,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656478,1733261425,Dogecoin Whales Keep Buying – DOGE Metrics Reveal Demand Remains Strong,"Dogecoin has been navigating a period of choppy price action, with little opportunity for strategic buys and no decisive breakouts to guide traders. Despite this uncertainty, key data from Santiment provides a glimmer of hope for Dogecoin enthusiasts. Over the weekend, Dogecoin whales accumulated an additional 160 million DOGE, signaling potential confidence in the meme coin leader’s upward trajectory. This renewed whale activity comes when Dogecoin attempts to regain momentum and reestablish its market position. Such large-scale accumulation often precedes significant price movements, suggesting the possibility of further upside in the coming weeks. Related Reading: XRP Reaches 6-Year High – Whales And STH Accumulate Together As DOGE inches closer to the psychological $1 target, the next few weeks will be critical for the meme coin. A breakout above key resistance levels could reignite retail investors’ enthusiasm and signal the start of a new bullish phase. However, failure to sustain this momentum may lead to continued volatility, testing the patience of even its most loyal supporters. Dogecoin’s path forward remains uncertain, but with whales stepping in and market interest reignited, the stage is set for a potentially transformative period for the popular cryptocurrency. All eyes are on DOGE as it sets its sights on the elusive $1 mark. Dogecoin Sets High Expectations Dogecoin is capturing market attention as it surpasses multi-year resistance levels and embarks on what some are calling an “only up” trajectory. This impressive rally has reignited interest in the meme coin leader, solidifying its dominance in the meme coin market. Analysts and traders closely monitor Dogecoin’s price action, with many expecting further highs. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared data from Santiment, revealing that Dogecoin whales accumulated an additional 160 million $DOGE over the weekend. This significant whale activity lends credibility to the bullish narrative surrounding DOGE, suggesting that key market players are positioning themselves for continued upside. Historically, such large-scale purchases often precede substantial price movements, adding to the optimism that Dogecoin could maintain its upward momentum. Despite the bullish sentiment, risks remain. Dogecoin’s performance is closely tied to Bitcoin’s trajectory, which currently faces a crucial test at the $100,000 level. If Bitcoin fails to break above this psychological barrier in the coming days, the broader crypto market could experience a pullback, potentially dragging DOGE down. Related Reading: Dogecoin Ready To Hit $1 – Price Struggles To Break Above Major Resistance For now, Dogecoin continues to lead the meme coin market, setting new benchmarks and captivating investors. As whales double down and market dynamics evolve, the coming weeks will determine whether Dogecoin can maintain its rally or face a temporary correction. DOGE Testing Liquidity Dogecoin is positioning itself for a potential bullish continuation as it forms a technical pattern that, once broken, could propel the price to new highs. This pattern reflects growing optimism among traders, aligning with the broader upward momentum in the crypto market. However, DOGE faces a crucial test at the $0.44 resistance level, which has acted as a strong barrier in recent sessions. A decisive break above this level could set the stage for another significant rally. Currently, DOGE is testing demand around the $0.42 mark, a critical support level that has helped sustain its recent price action. Holding this level is essential for maintaining bullish sentiment. If DOGE breaks above $0.44, it could attract renewed buying interest, driving the price into uncharted territory. Related Reading: Cardano Transactions Rise To Multi-Year Highs – Metrics Support Bullish Outlook Conversely, failure to breach the $0.44 resistance could lead to prolonged consolidation. In such a scenario, DOGE may continue to trade within a tight range as the market awaits further catalysts. If demand weakens, the meme coin could even experience a correction, retesting lower support levels.

37184337,https://blockworks.co/news/sol-demand-cripples-coinbase-indexers,1733261400,"Coinbase indexers buckle under SOL demand, ‘dusting’ attacks","This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Coinbase is making a lot of money from Solana traders these days, but the influx of demand is also causing some headaches for America’s largest crypto exchange. Coinbase is receiving more Solana send and receive requests “than ever before,” according to an employee, and so-called dusting attacks have become commonplace, causing Coinbase to take longer than usual to show SOL transactions on users’ accounts. This gets at an interesting problem Solana faces: While the blockchain processes data very quickly, the venues that need to make use of that data sometimes struggle to keep up. Coinbase’s struggle is with data indexing, which is the process of taking blockchain transaction data — which comes as a jumble of bits — and putting it in a format that things like crypto exchanges can read. When a blockchain produces as much data as Solana does, this can get demanding and pricey. To contextualize how much data Solana produces, Blockworks Research data lead Dan Smith pointed to an experiment run by Eigen Labs to show the capacity of its EigenDA data product. Eigen Labs posted every block from 19 blockchains for a period of time in September, representing roughly 20 terabytes of data, and Solana accounted for a staggering 97% of the total. Coinbase’s indexers currently “can’t keep up” with Solana demand, a protocol specialist at the exchange wrote on X. Making matters worse, dusting has become “constant” on Coinbase, the protocol specialist wrote . Dusting refers to sending tiny amounts of crypto to many wallet addresses in hopes of tracking them. I moved SOL around on Coinbase while writing this article, and my wallet received two different dust transactions. This “dust” is trivial to the sender, but it can become a big strain for Coinbase’s data load. And Solana’s indexing challenges run deeper than just volume. Solana indexing is particularly difficult compared to Ethereum because the former lacks a uniform interface for smart contracts, which are the computer programs that run on the blockchain. “[W]hen you look at your transactions across many of these [Solana] programs, the data is just a jumble of bytes which are not human readable,” Tristan Frizza, founder of Zeta Markets, said. Since there’s no established way to read the data, it becomes difficult for indexers, block explorers, or data platforms like Dune to break down what different Solana transactions are actually doing. Helius CEO Mert Mumtaz said the Solana development platform will be rolling out three new features in the next two months that he estimated could solve 80% of Solana’s “read layer issues.” But until then, exchanges will keep having to index a blockchain that is seeing record demand.

He has reportedly agreed to a maximum sentencing guideline of 360 months, or 30 years, in prison.    Last July, Mashinsky was arrested in New York and charged with seven criminal counts tied to the operation of and the 2022 collapse of his company, including securities fraud, commodities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to manipulate the price of Celsius’ native token, CEL.    “I said that Celsius had approval from regulators. It was false. I falsely said I was not selling my CEL tokens, I accept full responsibility for my actions,” Inner City Press quoted Mashinsky as saying in court. “I did not know which law it was violating, but I knew it was wrong … and illegal.”    Mashinsky originally pleaded not guilty and attempted to have two of the charges — the commodities manipulation charge and a market manipulation charge — dismissed. However, the judge overseeing Mashinsky’s case, U.S. District Court Judge John G. Koeltl of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) ruled that his attorney’s arguments against the charges were “without merit” meaning that, if he went to trial, Mashinsky would have to face the full seven-count indictment.    He pled guilty to commodities and securities fraud on Tuesday.    Celsius halted withdrawals in June 2022, a month after the collapse of Do Kwon’s Terra/LUNA, citing “extreme market conditions.” The following month, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New York, one of the first in a slew of bankruptcies of similarly-situated crypto platforms including Voyager Digital, BlockFi, Genesis and FTX.    Read More: The Fall of Celsius Network: A Timeline of The Crypto Lender’s Descent into Insolvency    Though the collapse of Terra/LUNA and crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital put a squeeze on many crypto companies in the latter half of 2022, Celsius had itself — and its management — to blame for its financial woes.    For years before Celsius' collapse, Mashinsky was telling customers on his regular livestreams not to “listen to the FUD-ers” about the company’s lending practices, assuring them that “Celsius does not do non-collateralized loans…Celsius will not do that because that would be taking too much risk on your behalf.” However, the company was, in fact, making uncollateralized loans. When it filed for bankruptcy, lawyers for the crypto lending platform admitted Celsius had a $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet.

37183792,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622232,1733260541,Aave (AAVE) whale activity reaches two-year peak as lending expands,"Aave (AAVE) has solidified its position in the top 40 of crypto assets. The Ethereum (ETH) expansion led to a recovery in lending. Aave is once again attracting whales at levels not seen since 2022. Aave activity is increasing with this year’s bull market. As with other assets and protocols, Aave benefitted from the inflow of stablecoins and the rise of ETH market prices. The latest upward leg for the crypto market also helped Aave recover its value locked to levels not seen since the 2021 bull rally. Aave now locks in more than $20B in liquidity, turning into the largest lending protocol after months of rebuilding. Aave is also considered one of the most undervalued protocols, with a market cap of $3.53B, just a fraction of the value carried in its lending vaults. Over the course of 2024, Aave successfully replaced the unwinding of Maker and turned into one of the key sources of yield. Even Donald Trump’s protocol, World Liberty Financial , planned to build an instance of Aave for its own share of liquidity. Aave had a slow return during this phase of the bull market, as the protocol was cautious about contagion and vetted its collateral assets. The real expansion of Aave started in October, with more sustainably high borrow volumes and growth of collaterals. USDC was the most borrowed asset, for its multiple applications in yield or trading. AAVE broke into the top 40 tokens AAVE broke into the top 40 after a 40% growth in the past week. The asset tracked closely the trend among altcoins, which have gone through accumulation for months. AAVE traded at $235.60, close to its 2022 range from before the bear market. Aave (AAVE) traded at a one-year peak above $237. | Source: Coinmarketcap The token traded near its yearly peak, with the highest volumes in the year to date. Open interest for AAVE expanded to a three-year peak above $171M , with a 70% prevalence of long positions. The open interest is much smaller compared even to meme tokens. AAVE is making a return after 900 days of accumulation and is yet to attract short-term traders. Trading for AAVE is split among exchanges, thus forgoing concentrated pumps on Binance. This led to a more gradual growth for the token until now, when the official altcoin market was announced. From 2025 onward, Aave will start unlocking its ecosystem reserve. Currently, AAVE tokens are more than 81% unlocked and have overcome the years of selling. The 2025 unlocks will be gradual, and will go toward ecosystem incentives. From this range, AAVE is expected to test the $400 level, then move above its peak levels over $629. In an extended bull cycle, AAVE is expected to rival the former valuations of MKR with four-digit prices in the most bullish scenario. Aave grows stablecoin liquidity One of the key features of Aave is its partnership with other DeFi protocols. Aave is gradually incorporating other assets, one of which is Ethena’s USDe. The synthetic stablecoin is considered riskier but has been released into Aave vaults. In two months, Aave moved up from an experimental 2M USDe to 620M. USDe can be used as collateral, releasing a total of $578M liquidity in other assets, with a margin for over-collateralization. AAVE diminished the supply of GHO, its native stablecoin, back under the cutoff range of 175M. The current supply of GHO is back at 169M tokens, for now delaying a buyback and burn of AAVE tokens. The liquidity profile of Aave is also shifting. The share of Arbitrum lending has increased to 20% of all volumes, with more influence from Avalanche and Optimism. Ethereum and Base remain the biggest platforms for Aave. In terms of whale transactions, Aave is also returning to levels not seen since 2022. AAVE saw a total of 587 whale transactions based on Santiment data. Those monthly levels are the highest since March 2022, before Aave cut its liquidity in response to the shrinking crypto market.

Ripple (XRP): Breaking Long-standing Resistance Levels Ripple has recently shattered significant resistance levels, marking its resurgence as one of the best cryptos to buy right now. Analysts are raving about the “Nike swoosh” pattern identified in XRP’s price movements, which signals a strong upward trajectory. For a coin that has long been priced under $1, breaking through $1.60 could unlock incredible potential for this asset. Market analyst EGRAG projects that if Ripple maintains its momentum, price targets of $1.60 and beyond are achievable. On a non-logarithmic scale, XRP could even soar to $6.40, delivering massive returns for investors entering at the current price. For those eyeing the next big move, Ripple remains a solid contender among the top crypto by market cap. Ripple’s consistent performance and groundbreaking analysis make it a strong contender. For those eyeing big gains, its rally is one to watch. Algorand (ALGO): Bullish Momentum Builds Algorand is making waves in the crypto market with its bullish breakout, fuelled by a double-bottom pattern that has caught the attention of top analysts. Recently surging to $0.359, ALGO is now primed for significant gains, with price targets of $0.750 and even $1.26 in the short term. ALGO’s recent technical indicators, such as its RSI and MACD, strongly support the bullish outlook. With no major resistance in sight, this asset is positioned to double in value, making it one of the best cryptos to buy right now. Its trajectory since recovering from an all-time high of $2.99 has been a testament to its resilience and growth potential. At its current price of $0.359, Algorand offers a significant opportunity for investors. As its bullish momentum grows, its role in the crypto ecosystem becomes ever more crucial. The Final Word: Don’t Miss Out The crypto market is full of opportunities, but these three projects stand out. Qubetics’ presale is your chance to invest in a groundbreaking ecosystem that’s simplifying blockchain development. Ripple’s momentum and Algorand’s bullish patterns point to a future of exciting growth and strong investment potential. Act now. Qubetics’ presale prices are set to rise, and Ripple and Algorand are primed for impressive growth.

On-chain analyst Ki Young Ju tells his 379,400 followers on the social media platform X that the primary drivers of the current Bitcoin rally are entities not interested in loading up on altcoins. According to the CryptoQuant executive, altcoins now have to come up with a compelling use case as they can no longer rely on Bitcoin’s momentum to see higher prices. “Compared to the last cycle, the nature of capital flowing into Bitcoin has shifted. The current Bitcoin rally is primarily driven by demand from institutional investors and spot ETFs (exchange-traded funds). Unlike crypto exchange users, institutional investors and ETF buyers have no intention of rotating their assets from Bitcoin to altcoins. Moreover, as they operate outside of crypto exchanges, asset rotation becomes inherently less feasible… Altcoins should focus on developing independent strategies to attract new capital rather than relying on Bitcoin’s momentum.” Ki Young Ju also notes that the recent explosion in the volume of some altcoins is due to a rise in the liquidity of dollar-pegged crypto assets. “Altseason is no longer defined by asset rotation from Bitcoin. The surge in altcoin trading volume isn’t driven by BTC pairs but by stablecoin and fiat pairs, reflecting real market growth rather than asset rotation. Stablecoin liquidity better explains the altcoin markets.” The analyst goes on to say that while he’s bullish on altcoins, he thinks that the rising tide will not lift all boats. “Don’t get me wrong, I’m bullish on altcoins. Just pointing out that only a select few attract fresh capital. Altcoin season will come, but it’ll be for a few, not every altcoin will hit its previous all-time high.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

37183377,https://blockworks.co/news/bitwise-crypto-etfs-treasurys-exposure,1733259600,A new kind of crypto ETF weighs market trends,"This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . A fund issuer has adjusted several of its crypto ETFs to accommodate those seeking a different type of exposure to the space. They’re crypto futures funds that had lost some luster when spot products became available — but now feature a twist. Bitwise officially converted three of its futures-based ETFs to “Trendwise” products that rotate between crypto and US Treasurys based on crypto market price trends. Essentially the funds will stick to investing in crypto futures when the 10-day exponential moving average of the price of BTC or ETH is above the 20-day EMA (when prices are gaining momentum), the company said Tuesday. They would rotate into Treasurys when the opposite is occurring. In other words, the strategies consider price momentum in an effort to boost risk-adjusted returns while reducing downside risk. Bitwise launched its BTC futures ETF in March 2023. It brought to market an ETH futures offering (and one holding both BTC and ETH futures contracts) in October 2023. A year later from the latter launches (just weeks ago), the firm then revealed these planned adjustments. The fund strategy changes are a few of the latest examples of crypto ETF innovation. As we’ve written about previously, a number of issuers have filed for so-called buffer or covered call strategies, for example, after the listing of bitcoin ETF options . Others seek to bring new crypto assets ( solana , XRP , etc .) into the ETF wrapper. WisdomTree published plans for a planned XRP fund on Monday — following Bitwise , 21Shares and Canary Capital. Though US spot bitcoin ETFs have been the category’s chief asset gatherers — with $31 billion of net inflows since their January launches — the crypto space appears poised to evolve and grow as more investors come in (and potentially under the oversight of more crypto-friendly regulators). With that, there should be plenty of demand for more nuanced products, and those with a focus beyond the largest crypto asset.

In a new interview posted to Blockmedia, Arthur Hayes says he believes BTC will eventually reach $1 million in value in the next five years. “I’ve been on record many times saying that I think Bitcoin will end the year around $100,000. Obviously, we’re close to that mark. Then the next question is where do I think Bitcoin is going to be, you know, three, four, five years down the road? As I’ll get into in a bit, I believe that the secular trend is for more money printing globally. That’s not going to stop, and as such, my Bitcoin $1 million price prediction, I believe, can happen within the next 5 years.” According to Hayes, most governments of the world simply cannot afford to cut expenses and raise taxes, and will be forced into expanding the monetary supply in order to pay off debts. He says the phenomenon is one of the main reasons he is bullish on crypto. “And so again, what are the key factors driving this confidence that I have in the continuation of the bull market? It centers on money printing. At the end of the day, the largest economic blocks in countries – United States, China, Japan, the European Union, and just about every other country around the world, including South Korea – are printing money. They have different goals and policies that they want to afford but they can’t afford with taxes that’ll piss people off, and so they’re printing money. This is a trend that went into overdrive starting in 2008 when Satoshi obviously came up with the Bitcoin white paper and the Genesis block was in 2009. I don’t believe that’s a coincidence that the birth of Bitcoin and this cryptocurrency ecosystem coincided with one of the largest financial crises since the 1930s… And so that’s why I’m very confident that crypto, which predominantly is priced in fiat currencies, can rise. And as we’ve seen, Bitcoin is the best-performing asset in human history, from 0 in 2009 to close to $2 trillion of market cap in about 15 years.” BTC is worth $95,026 at time of writing.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana (SOL) shows a bullish trend as Dogwifhat (WIF) and Lunex Network (LNEX) attract investor inflows. Table of Contents Jackis: Solana price discovery may still come Dogwifhat price Lunex Network price continues rising Lunex Network to soar like Solana and Dogwifhat The crypto market is picking up steam, with Solana (SOL) showing green price charts. Market analyst Jackis thinks that price discovery could come soon for this altcoin. Meanwhile, investors are looking at other crypto coins, including Dogwifhat (WIF) and Lunex Network (LNEX) , for potentially bigger returns. While WIF is an established meme coin, LNEX is a presale star. It has given early buyers a 175% return, and with its potential to transform DeFi, experts foresee a 7x surge for LNEX in 2025. Jackis: Solana price discovery may still come Solana is one of the top crypto coins at the moment. CoinMarketCap shows that the Solana price jumped from $173 to $239 on the one-month chart, an increase of nearly 40%. In addition, the Solana market cap moved past the $110B mark for the first time. Crypto analyst Jackis remains optimistic for Solana. In his X post , Jackis suggested that the altcoin may be a good long play as price discovery is still in the cards. TradingView shows that the Solana crypto is valued above its 20-day EMA of $227 and its 30-day EMA. Additionally, its bull-bear power indicator sits at -23.40, opening the door for buyers to take charge if bullish sentiment continues. You might also like: SHIB & Bonk poised to race with XRP in 2025 as Lunex Network set to replicate BNB’s ICO Dogwifhat price Dogwifhat is among the best meme coins in the market. In the past 30 days, the Dogwifhat price increased over 50% as per CoinMarketCap . In this period, its value moved between $2.29 and $3.19. The technical analysis for Dogwifhat is also showing good signs. The meme coin is currently valued above its 30-day EMA of $3 and its 100-day EMA as per TradingView . Additionally, the momentum indicator sits at -0.50 in the buy zone, suggesting this uptrend continuing. Notably, market expert CryptoJack made a bullish Dogwifhat price forecast on his X page , suggesting a potential surge to $5. Lunex Network price continues rising According to recent data-driven predictions, the DeFi market could be worth around $48B by 2031. The Lunex Network aims to capitalize on this growth by launching a unique non-custodial crypto exchange that connects all isolated blockchains. On it, people will be able to trade crypto coins across different blockchains while being anonymous thanks to its no sign-up KYC checks. By holding the LNEX token, traders will get many benefits on this platform, including: Governance rights: Vote for the future development of Lunex Network. Passive income: Earn up to 18% APY through staking. Exclusive discounts: Enjoy reduced fees and other perks. Currently, LNEX costs $0.0033, a 175% rise from its beginning presale price. However, the price of this DeFi coin will rise on a three-day basis, and a Tier-1 crypto exchange listing is expected to push the value to $0.0216. This suggests a 729% return from current price levels. Lunex Network to soar like Solana and Dogwifhat While Solana and Dogwifhat are altcoins to watch as they could skyrocket soon, analysts are also paying attention to Lunex Network. Since this rookie has a smaller market cap, its value may surge with less money. For more information on Lunex Network, visit their website or socials .

37182445,https://nulltx.com/?p=135128,1733258728,"Trending Meme Coins: BTFD Rockets Ahead, Baby Doge Champions Charity, and Notcoin Gains Buzz","Meme coins have been the heartbeat of the crypto world, captivating audiences with their unique blend of humour and potential financial upside. In December 2024, all eyes are on three standout projects: BTFD Coin, Baby Doge Coin, and Notcoin. Each brings its own flavour to the meme coin universe, from game-changing presale stats to charitable endeavours and cult-like loyalty. BTFD Coin has exploded onto the scene with its stellar presale performance, already raising over $700,000 in its first week. Meanwhile, Baby Doge Coin continues to showcase its philanthropic spirit, strengthening its position as a feel-good investment. And then there’s Notcoin, which is riding the waves of speculation with a bullish setup that has analysts and traders buzzing. Together, these projects represent the evolving nature of meme coins: part entertainment, part investment, all potential. In this article, we’ll dive into what makes BTFD Coin, Baby Doge Coin, and Notcoin the best new cryptos to buy this month. Buckle up; it’s going to be a wild ride! BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Bull Market If you’re searching for the best new crypto to buy, BTFD Coin is stealing the show. With its presale, at an initial price of just $0.000004, BTFD has already reached Stage 6, now priced at $0.000058. Over 18 billion coins have been sold, and the project has attracted 1,700 loyal Bulls who are betting on its long-term success. The numbers don’t lie. BTFD Coin’s presale has raised over $700,000 in just one week, making it one of the fastest-growing meme coins on the market. Its appeal lies in its robust ecosystem, which includes a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game and a staking rewards program designed to keep its community engaged and incentivised. But what really has people talking is the potential for explosive returns. Consider this: if you invested $4,000 in Stage 6 at the current price of $0.000058, you’d receive roughly 68,965,517 BTFD coins. Once the coin hits its projected listing price of $0.0006, that initial investment could swell to $41,379.31. That’s a staggering return on investment—nearly 10x your money in a matter of months. It’s not just the maths that’s driving excitement. BTFD’s branding, centred around a bullish mindset and community-driven growth, has sparked a cult-like following on social media. Memes, FOMO-filled discussions, and vibrant online debates are propelling BTFD Coin beyond the typical meme coin mould. With 10 stages still to go in its presale, the window to jump in at a low price is narrowing fast. Baby Doge Coin: The Charitable Hero of the Meme Coin World Baby Doge Coin might not be the newest kid on the block, but it’s proving that being established doesn’t mean being stale. Operating on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Baby Doge has carved out a reputation as the meme coin with a heart. Its philanthropic initiatives—including donations to animal shelters and community welfare projects—have made it a favourite for investors looking to make an impact while growing their portfolios. The coin’s transparency and community-focused ethos have kept it relevant in a crowded market. While newer coins like BTFD may boast higher short-term returns, Baby Doge offers something many investors value: stability. Its steady rise, backed by a devoted fanbase, makes it one of the best new cryptos to buy if you’re seeking a reliable addition to your portfolio. One of the highlights of Baby Doge’s ongoing success is its ability to stay culturally relevant. Whether it’s through meme-driven campaigns or its partnerships with nonprofit organisations, Baby Doge Coin continues to find ways to engage with its community. This approach not only solidifies its position in the meme coin ecosystem but also keeps the project’s roadmap aligned with its values. That said, Baby Doge isn’t without challenges. While it’s a feel-good investment, its growth trajectory doesn’t match the meteoric rise of coins like BTFD. However, for investors who value purpose and predictability over hype, Baby Doge remains a solid choice in December 2024. Notcoin: The Underdog with a Bullish Setup Notcoin has always been a bit of an enigma. As one of the meme coin pioneers, it holds a nostalgic place in the crypto world. But recently, it’s been making headlines for more than just its legacy. Analysts are keeping a close eye on its charts, which show a bullish falling wedge pattern that could indicate an impending breakout. At its current consolidation level, Notcoin presents a fascinating opportunity for short-term gains. If it breaks out as analysts predict, the price could soar to $0.012, representing a significant leap from its current position. This potential has attracted speculative traders who thrive on high-risk, high-reward opportunities. But let’s not forget what makes Notcoin tick. Its loyal community has stuck with it through thick and thin, cementing its status as a cultural icon in the crypto space. While it might not have the flashiness of BTFD or the philanthropic charm of Baby Doge, Notcoin’s unique place in the meme coin pantheon keeps it relevant. For those willing to bet on a classic with a modern twist, Notcoin could be the best new crypto to buy this month. The key? Timing. With a potential breakout on the horizon, investors will need to stay vigilant to maximise their returns. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, the meme coin space is alive and kicking with opportunities this December. BTFD Coin leads the pack with its explosive presale performance, offering staggering growth potential for early investors. Baby Doge Coin, with its heartwarming mission and steady rise, remains a feel-good investment for those seeking stability. And Notcoin, with its bullish setup, presents a high-risk, high-reward play that could pay off handsomely. For those eager to ride the meme coin wave, there’s no better time than now. The crypto market waits for no one, and the next big opportunity could be just a click away. Join the BTFD Coin presale today , or explore Baby Doge Coin and Notcoin to find the best fit for your portfolio. The choice is yours—but don’t wait too long. The meme coin revolution is happening now, and you don’t want to miss out!

With Bitcoin’s dominance weakening and global crypto regulating, many expect an altcoin rally, and there are various opinions on how it will unfold. Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the former CEO of Binance, recently raised questions about a potential altcoin season with an X post featuring the “Alt” key on a keyboard. He asked, “Which key is available on Windows and Linux but not on Mac?” The answer is the “Alt” key. As he tweeted, many commented, guessing he was indicating the upcoming Alt season, which is the most expected rally as Bitcoin stalls below the $100k price mark. Which key is available on Windows and Linux, but not on Mac? pic.twitter.com/z4wfZbPbbD — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) December 3, 2024 Bitcoin’s surge and altcoins’ recovery BTC has risen by 125% in 2024, but altcoins like XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Chainlink remain below their all-time highs. The TOTAL2 index, which tracks altcoin market capitalization, currently stands at $1.5 trillion, far from its peak of $1.71 trillion in 2021, suggesting there is still room for growth in the altcoin market. The global regulation of crypto strengthens the chances of an altcoin season. Countries like Singapore, Japan, and Switzerland have made progress in regulating crypto, which increases market appeal. With Bitcoin’s dominance weakening and altcoin market caps rising, it looks like altcoins may soon outperform Bitcoin. Though there were many supporters and potential for Bitcoin, Altcoins has its own potential unlike meme coins, even CZ was frustrated about the meme coin hypes and he felt weird about it. As per the technical analysis, this could be the longest and highest bull run for Altcoins. CryptoQuant’s take on the altcoin rally But, Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, shares his views on the altcoin season. He thinks Bitcoin is moving away from the wider crypto market, mainly because of its increasing involvement in paper-based Layer-2 systems like Bitcoin ETFs and stocks of Bitcoin-friendly companies like MicroStrategy. This change has broken the usual link between Bitcoin and altcoins. Ju believes that only a few altcoins are gaining new liquidity and showing unique trends. Ju also argues that the next altcoin rally will likely be driven more by stablecoin liquidity rather than Bitcoin asset rotation. With many countries adopting and legalizing cryptocurrency, the potential for an altcoin season is growing. Still, it is expected to be more selective and unpredictable, with only the most resilient and innovative projects emerging as winners. Altcoins now have two options: create paper-wrapped versions like Bitcoin or develop a more robust “Internet money” ecosystem using stablecoins or Bitcoin itself. Investors are advised to focus on projects that offer long-term value and adaptability, as this altseason is expected to be different from previous ones, with only a few altcoins showing true potential.

Brandt, an XRP skeptic, has offered a surprisingly optimistic forecast. In his latest analysis, Brandt shared a price chart highlighting a critical breakout for XRP. The chart illustrates how XRP overcame a dynamic resistance level of around $0.92, which fueled its bullish trend. Based on this breakout, Brandt suggests the token’s price could soar to $24. pic.twitter.com/1kuFxoWxM0 — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 1, 2024 Should this prediction materialize, XRP’s market capitalization would reach approximately $1.37 trillion, placing it among the world’s most valuable assets. For context, this valuation would surpass Tesla, raising questions about the feasibility of such a scenario. Is a $1.37 Trillion Market Cap Realistic? Achieving a price of $24 per XRP would require an extraordinary influx of capital and unprecedented market activity. While XRP has demonstrated its ability to rally significantly, critics argue that such a valuation might be difficult to sustain in the current macroeconomic environment. Skeptics point to the token’s reliance on market conditions, regulatory developments, and adoption rates as factors that could limit its upward trajectory. Nevertheless, proponents believe the cryptocurrency’s expanding use cases and recent legal victories could provide the momentum needed to achieve these ambitious milestones.

On December 2nd, the digital asset reached an impressive $2.72, marking a remarkable 432% increase in value since November. This surge has propelled XRP’s market capitalization to an all-time high of $155 billion, making it the third-largest cryptocurrency, surpassing Solana (SOL) and Tether’s USDT. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) remain the only assets ahead of XRP in market capitalization. This performance has astonished many market participants who, just a month ago, would have considered such achievements unlikely. Now, debates are rampant over how far XRP’s price might climb , especially since its previous all-time high, set in 2018, was below $1. With its current market cap already at historic levels, speculation is rife regarding what lies ahead for the digital asset. Broader Implications for the Market XRP’s meteoric rise has already reshaped the crypto market landscape, forcing investors and analysts to reevaluate their positions. As discussions surrounding Brandt’s prediction gain traction, the broader implications for market sentiment and capital allocation cannot be overlooked. While a $24 price target remains speculative, the discussion highlights the growing interest in XRP due to its potential role in the evolving financial ecosystem. Whether Brandt’s projection is realized or not, XRP’s recent performance has undeniably solidified its position as a key player in the digital asset space.

Porter disclosed the development via an X thread, highlighting efforts from his Satoshi Act Fund organization toward passing Bitcoin-focused laws.

He added that the notification was “completely useless” as both paths to unlock the account required him to sign in, which he couldn’t do. “Service agent on the phone also completely useless,” he added.

Very cool! pic.twitter.com/3s7waNxsWn — eric.eth (@econoar) December 2, 2024 Nuked Account a Lazy Solution Others pointed out that he wasn’t being ‘debanked’ but protected against account hacks and unauthorized transfers to safeguard the $25,000 USDC. It seems like a “lazy implementation if that’s the case,” he said before adding: “There are plenty of better ways to handle this than just nuking my account.” Connor then revealed that the account was locked out because he was using a VPN (virtual private network) when doing the transfer and there were no warnings that this may happen. There were lots of responses in agreement from those who had also been locked out of centralized exchange accounts with no warnings, some of them for months on end. Blockchain lawyer Joshua Carlson said that overall, the system is working as designed. “I would recommend setting up a passkeys and I wouldn’t be upset with Coinbase if they suspected somebody trying to hack into my account and they locked it. I’ll consider that a net benefit,” he added. Coinbase did respond to the post, stating, “We’re sorry to hear that your account was locked after sending your USDC assets. We’re currently looking into this and will reach out to you shortly. In the meantime, please send us a DM so we can provide you with updates directly.” A few hours after the lockout, Connor reported the incident resolved but added that the replies to his post on X were “mind-blowing.” “Hopefully Coinbase is working on a much better process for not so easily locking accounts AND recovering accounts. I’m lucky with my reach. Others, not so much…” Limits Decreased Without Warning Other responses were from customers complaining that their daily limits had recently decreased for no reason. Fellow Ethereum developer ‘Zak’ opined that this may be an effort to reduce selling pressure. “My theory is that they’re nerfing limits for people who have withdrawn over a certain amount within the past year or something to reduce sell-side pressure and keep liquidity on their books,” Centralized exchanges are slowly morphing into banks exhibiting similar behavior, such as arbitrary account lockouts, lack of customer support, limits on transactions, and demands for an increasing amount of personal information.

In November, the platform hit an all-time high of over $93 million. This remarkable leap, representing a 207% increase from October’s record of $30.5 million, signals a resurgence in investor interest and platform activity. As of now, Pump.fun’s cumulative revenue stands at $240 million, solidifying its place as a leading player in the memecoin space. Pump.fun Saw A Dramatic Reversal in Performance After experiencing a decline in revenues in August and September, recording an average drop of 29% each month, Pump.fun made a strong recovery in November. The platform’s ability to recover from this slump demonstrates the volatile yet promising nature of memecoin trading. It shows that fluctuations are common but can lead to significant rewards for those who engage with it at the right moment. Notably, Pump.fun celebrated a milestone of $100 million revenue for its developers in September. This happened after all Pump.fun developers requested a 1% fee on all transactions completed on the memecoin launchpad. Pump.fun Deployed Over 4 Million Tokens Pump.fun has deployed over 4.2 million memecoins, according to Dune Analytics. The platform’s success is not just in the volume of tokens it generates but also in the market capitalization of these tokens. As of the latest figures from CoinGecko, the total market cap of memecoins launched via Pump.fun stands at $6.63 billion. While this represents a 2.9% dip in the past 24 hours, the performance of certain tokens revealed the platform’s dynamic and its profitable potential. Memecoins like Peanut the Squirrel have risen 10% in the last 24 hours, gaining 900% over the past month. Similarly, Moondeng has surged by 99% in a single day, with a more than 285% increase over the past month. However, Act I: TThe AI Prophecy has led the way with a staggering 3,500% increase in the last 30 days. These massive gains show the speculative nature of memecoin investing, where big rewards come with high risks. Pump.fun’s New Features and Token Launch Plans Pump.fun has launched Pump Advanced, a new trading terminal. This new add is packed with features like charts, top holder stats, advanced filters, and live-updating threads, catering to professional traders. The platform also hinted at an upcoming token launch, marking a significant step in its growth. The announcement of Pump Advanced and the forthcoming token launch has generated significant buzz in the memecoin community. This has attracted new users eager to take advantage of the platform’s advanced tools and upcoming opportunities. These updates are a key part of Pump.fun’s broader strategy to re-engage users following the shutdown of its live streaming platform.

37182484,https://blockworks.co/news/congress-in-final-weeks-of-session,1733257800,Congress is back in session. Here’s what to expect in these final weeks.,"This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Congressional leaders are back on the Hill today for the final weeks of the session, and they have their work cut out. The current federal spending plan expires on Dec. 20, but a government shutdown seems unlikely (at least at this point). Both Republicans and Democrats have expressed interest in passing a continuing resolution that would fund the government through March. The upside for the GOP is they get to put off making bigger decisions until they have control of both chambers. The downside is President-elect Donald Trump probably doesn’t want Congress tied up in appropriation bills when he’s trying to get nominations through the Senate and pass tax, immigration and tariff policies . For Dems, the Senate would prefer to focus on getting as many of President Biden’s judicial nominations confirmed before the end of the year. Plus, funding bills need a 60-vote threshold in the Senate, and Republicans only have 53 seats. So Democrats are hardly ceding all their power. A three-month stopgap, for better or for worse, is probably what is going to happen. For those looking to see significant crypto policy movement in the first quarter of 2025, this isn’t great news. Still, industry officials seem confident that the second Trump administration will bring a new era of crypto policy to the US. Coinbase chief policy officer Faryar Shirzad told CNBC this week that he sees versions of the FIT21 bill and the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act moving “fairly quickly” next year. There’s no denying that a Republican majority in the House and the Senate (narrow as it may be) bodes well for getting crypto policy over the finish line. But at the end of the day, it comes down to what lawmakers — namely, committee heads — want to prioritize. We could see some action from Trump in the form of executive orders, especially should he hire a “crypto czar,” a potential position Blockworks first reported on in July. The crypto czar would likely have a team, potentially made up of industry execs and interested parties, we’ve heard from people close to the matter. If you’re looking to read the tea leaves on who might make up this new crypto policy council, I’d start with Trump’s top industry donors. In terms of agency actions, the Senate will need to confirm SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s successor, plus a replacement for resigning Commissioner Jaime Lizárrage. Rumor has it that Trump could name his pick to lead the SEC today. One outlet reported that Trump already asked former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins to head the agency (citing those “familiar with discussions”), but that Atkins has not yet accepted. Atkins did not immediately return Blockworks’ request for comment. Another name that has come up in SEC chair speculation is Brian Brooks, an ex-acting comptroller of the currency. The next SEC chair would probably replace Sanjat Wadhwa, who currently works as acting director of the division of enforcement. This has potential to really shake up how the SEC pursues enforcement actions and which actors it chooses to target. As for ongoing enforcement actions, I’ve said before that I’m skeptical we’ll see the SEC just drop these cases as the process is a bit more complicated than that. But stranger things have happened.

Let’s show the world that crypto is a true force for good. Help us reach $200M in crypto donations by 12/31! Read a message from our Co-Founders @thisisPatDuffy & @AlexWilsonTGB https://t.co/438da1sC6U — The Giving Block (@TheGivingBlock) December 3, 2024 Crypto Giving Tuesday Expected To Generate 300% More Donations Pat Duffy, Co-Founder of The Giving Block, told Cryptonews that Crypto Giving Tuesday is the biggest day of the year for raising awareness around “crypto-for-good” use cases. Crypto Giving Tuesday, which falls on December 3, is the same day as Giving Tuesday. The Giving Block started the initiative in 2017 and has been an annual event ever since. “Crypto Giving Tuesday is a day of cryptocurrency giving, but it’s also the day where the industry takes a moment to tell stories about all the good that crypto can provide,” Duffy said. While Crypto Giving Tuesday has succeeded in previous years, Duffy believes 2024 will be monumental for crypto donations. “We expect to see a lot more giving this December versus last, as we’re on pace to raise over 300% more this year versus 2023,” he remarked. “In a year like 2024, when prices are soaring, crypto giving has tripled, and the tax incentive to donate crypto has never been stronger, nonprofits must make the most of this opportunity.” Non-Profits Participating In Crypto Giving Tuesday It’s notable that many non-profit organizations are participating in Crypto Giving Tuesday this year. For example, the Make-A-Wish Foundation – a U.S.-based organization helping millions of children in need —has partnered with The Giving Block to accept crypto donations . Make-A-Wish began partnering with The Giving Block in 2021 and has since used crypto donations to expand its efforts into three new countries. This year we will grant over 15,000 wishes to children like Jasper. Wishes bring back childhood when illness has stolen it away – restoring hope and joy when it is needed the most.

The organization works with hundreds of hospitals worldwide to improve the quality of life for hospitalized children by providing them with video games. Edwin Nolasco, Marketing Director at Gamers Outreach, told Cryptonews that Gamers Outreach accepts donations year-long through The Giving Block’s portal. “This enables us to continue our mission of providing the power of play to hospitalized families,” Nolasco said. He added that The Giving Block’s portal makes it easy for non-profits to accept crypto donations due to the vetting process. “This provides organizations with confidence, allowing donors to understand that their crypto is going directly towards charitable causes.” Duffy shared that The Giving Block expects over 1,000 non-profits to participate in Crypto Giving Tuesday this year. These include Save the Children, Feeding America, St. Jude, the American Cancer Society, and many others. Why Crypto Giving Tuesday Is Important For Organizations Crypto Giving Tuesday allows organizations to easily accept donations and demonstrates how crypto can save lives. Shaney Jo Darden, Founder of The Keep A Breast Foundation—a California-based non-profit focused on the prevention and early detection of breast cancer—told Cryptonews that Keep A Breast has participated in Crypto Giving Tuesday for the past three years. This has enabled the organization to support those impacted by breast cancer. “Every contribution helps us empower more survivors, providing them with the resources and freedom to rebuild their lives,” Jo Darden said. She added that crypto donations go a long way, noting that 1 Bitcoin (BTC) donated currently supports 198 breast cancer survivors. “1 ETH will support six survivors and 2 SOL will support one survivor,” she said. 1 BTC can support 198 women.

Crypto operates at a scale and speed that makes a lot of things possible that weren’t even imaginable a few years ago.” Meme Coins Making An Impact This Year It’s also interesting to point out that meme coins are being leveraged to support charitable causes. “Meme coins can be massive for Crypto Giving Tuesday if their communities decide to show up and show out,” Duffy said. While meme coins can generate mixed results, Duffy explained that a meme coin community can sometimes spur a big December giving period, locking in one or several nonprofit partners. “We saw this when the DOGE community locked in on the Team Seas fundraiser with Mr. Beast and Mark Rober, or when Bored Ape Yacht Club locked in on Orangutan Outreach and raised over $1,000,000 for the charity, tripling their total fundraising that year,” Duffy explained. Ryan Ferris, S.A.N.’s project lead, told Cryptonews that $forest meme tokens have enabled the $forest community to run four biosphere preservation fundraisers. “We have raised $65,000 to date for biosphere charities,” Ferris said. “All transactions have been made publicly on chain via The Giving Block.” $forest meme token image. Source: Ryan Ferris Cindy Higby, creator of the meme coin “BOOJI,” told Cryptonews that BOOJI was initiated to save endangered gorillas. “BOOJI is an ape mascot and the BOOJI community has already adopted about 10 gorillas,” Higby said. Higby added that it’s important for crypto holders to spread wealth for good causes. “Some people have made a fortune off BOOJI, and some are long term holders – but either way we need to demonstrate crypto for good use cases. We are setting an important example for meme coins,” she said. Duffy added that meme coins have had massive success throughout 2024. He, therefore, hopes to see these communities take the opportunity to give back. Tax Benefits Associated With Crypto Donations It’s also important to point out that a number of tax benefits are associated with crypto donations . Jonathan Bander, managing partner and head of the tax strategy at ExperityCPA, told Cryptonews that transferring ownership of crypto assets directly to charitable organizations helps donors sidestep capital gains taxes. Bander explained that this year, individual donors can deduct up to 60 percent of their adjusted gross income (AGI) for cash donations to public charities and up to 30 percent of AGI for donations of appreciated assets, including cryptocurrency. “If your charitable contributions exceed these limits, you can carry forward the excess for up to five additional tax years, potentially maximizing your tax benefits over time,” Bander said. Bander explained that a Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT) is an appealing option for donors looking to maximize the benefits of their crypto donations . “CRTs provide additional tax advantages, including immediate partial tax deductions and potential estate tax reductions. They also allow donors to receive an income stream while the donated crypto grows tax-free within the trust,” he said. The benefits associated with crypto donations are yet another reason for traditional organizations to participate in Crypto Giving Tuesday. Christie Garton, CEO of 1,000 Dreams Fund (1DF) – a non-profit dedicated to supporting young women in need – told Cryptonews that this is 1DF’s first crypto giving effort. Garton explained that while 1DF is excited about the potential flood of crypto donations this year, this often translates into more capital to give back to the community tax-efficiently. “The Future Fund and 1DF’s new ability to accept crypto donations provides that avenue,” Garton said.

Elon’s Billions (ELONBILL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONBILL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Billions can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Billions could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Billions launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Billions on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Billions by entering its contract address – 5VkZGZPArjvA7aDTMVenePmqW62rRZtugUPqC8kEXaez – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONBILL.

37181240,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=311531,1733256235,Perennial Unveils a Novel Intent Layer for Perpetuals – Solving DeFi’s Fragmented Liquidity Problem,"December 3, 2024 – New York, United States Perennial announced the launch of Perennial Intents, a unique intents layer for perpetual futures, designed to unify DeFi’s fragmented liquidity landscape and deliver a centralized exchange trading experience on-chain. By sourcing liquidity from on-chain and off-chain venues, Perennial Intents is delivering deeper markets, better prices and a unified trading experience designed to move DeFi forward. Tackling DeFi’s liquidity fragmentation Kevin Britz, founder of Perennial, said, “Perennial Intents arrive at a pivotal time for DeFi. Despite its growth, only a fraction of crypto’s order flow happens on-chain – most of which is fragmented across hundreds of layer-ones and layer-twos. “The rise of appchains and isolated AMMs has led to over 100 chains with over $10 million in TVL (total value locked), each operating its own siloed financial ecosystem. “This fragmented liquidity leads to worse trade execution, with higher costs, increased slippage and limited leverage opportunities.” According to the team, Perennial Intents address these challenges by consolidating order flow into a unified liquidity layer. Instead of fragmenting liquidity into silos like appchains or AMM pools, intent-based trading integrates order flow across multiple venues, creating a more cohesive and efficient system. A hybrid model for the future of DeFi Although intents are not new to DeFi, Perennial Intents introduce a layered model that combines intent-based off-chain order matching with on-chain AMM settlement. Perennial claims this model streamlines trading by pairing intent-based order matching with on-chain AMM settlement. The team claims this hybrid approach guarantees optimal price execution for traders while enabling solvers to dynamically manage liquidity without long-term collateral constraints – unlocking deeper markets and greater efficiency. One-click trading and the Perennial Petals program Alongside Perennial Intents, the launch includes two additional upgrades – one-click trading and the Perennial Petals points program. Traders can now enjoy seamless trading with a single collateral account, while the Petals program rewards users with points for their trading activity, with two times points available during the initial launch period. The team at Arbitrum shared their excitement for the launch, highlighting the transformative potential of intent-based derivatives. Peter Haymond, senior partnerships manager at Offchain Labs, said, “Perennial’s work with intent-based derivatives is transforming DeFi by aligning market interactions with users’ specific goals. “This approach lets users define their desired financial outcomes, enabling more efficient and personalized trading on Arbitrum.” About Perennial Perennial is a DeFi-native derivatives primitive designed to serve as the liquidity backbone for DeFi. Backed by leading investors, including Polychain, Variant and Archetype, Perennial has facilitated over $2.8 billion in trading volume. Its growing ecosystem includes integrations with prominent trading interfaces like Kwenta , Siren , Rage Trade and Cryptex Finance .

37181174,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656470,1733256027,"Analyst Says Dogecoin Price At $1.3-$1.5 Is Still Possible, Here’s Why","The Dogecoin price has continued its consolidation just below the $0.44 level, but positive sentiment remains at a multi-year high. Crypto analyst Kevin, known on the social media platform X as @Kev_Capital_TA, has shared an updated perspective on a positive trajectory for the Dogecoin price, maintaining that the range of $1.30 to $1.50 is still a viable target. His recent post pointed to this price zone as a critical point of interest on his macro chart, aligning with the current market sentiment surrounding Dogecoin. Revisiting Kevin’s Macro Analysis And Earlier Projections This bullish prediction regarding the Dogecoin price builds on Kevin’s earlier analysis from September 18, where he outlined broader price targets as it approached a golden cross on the weekly timeframe for the first time in four years. This technical pattern is often seen as a signal of sustained bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $245,000? Here’s When You Should Be Expecting It Back then, he suggested that the Dogecoin price performance during this cycle could lead to price levels ranging from $0.93 for moderate growth to as high as $3.80 in an exceptionally strong market environment. Interestingly, both of these targets would see the Dogecoin price trading at new price territories higher than the 2021 peak. At that time, the Dogecoin price was trading at $0.10 and was on its way to break above the upper trendline of a descending channel. Since then, it has reached a peak of $0.44, translating to a 340% increase. Since the analysis, the meme coin has manifested this golden cross, prompting a strong bullish outlook for its price trajectory. Kevin’s updated $1.30-$1.50 target represents a midpoint that reflects both the coin’s current trajectory and the potential for continued growth under favorable conditions. The Path To $1.5 Dogecoin’s chart patterns and broader market sentiment support Kevin’s optimism. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at $0.4237 and has declined by about 2.5% in the past 24 hours since it reached a peak of $0.44. Interestingly, this $0.44 peak saw the Dogecoin price reach its highest point since May 2021.

However, the first step would be a decisive break above $0.44 and then a successive break above its current all-time high of $0.7316. Having already climbed by 330% over the past six weeks, Dogecoin is displaying signs of sustained growth, supported by market conditions and technical indicators.

Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) and WallitIQ (WLTQ) are grabbing headlines as they prepare for an explosive 54,540% growth within 8 days. WallitIQ (WLTQ), in particular, stands out as the better pick, with its presale at $0.0171 offering an unbeatable entry point for early participants. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Outshines Competitors With 54,540% Surge Forecast In 8 Days Analysts are now predicting that the Dogecoin price could soar to as high as $12, capturing the attention of crypto investors. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) is making steady progress, but WallitIQ (WLTQ) is quickly emerging as the must-buy, with an astonishing 54,540% growth forecasted over the next 8 days. WallitIQ (WLTQ) has performed exceptionally well during its presale, surpassing expectations and raising over $1.5 million. With over 80% of its tokens sold, investors have little time to participate in this WallitIQ (WLTQ) crypto presale.

The Dogecoin price has been steadily moving in its chart, with analysts predicting it could soar to $12 if the current bullish market trend continues. According to CoinMarketCap, the Dogecoin price has made impressive strides, increasing 121% last month and 3% in the past week. Currently, the Dogecoin price is trading at $0.3956, with its 24-hour trading volume down by 3% to $6 billion and its market cap dipping by 1% to $58 billion. With the Dogecoin price aiming for new price highs, analysts have revealed that it must break past resistance levels and overcome bear pressure to see any notable gains. Despite these fluctuations, the Dogecoin price still holds lesser investment and bullish opportunities than the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token which analysts are urging investors to invest in fast before its presale ends. Ripple (XRP) Gains Momentum: Could It Surge 54,540% In The Coming Days? Ripple (XRP), a well-known player in cross-border payments, has been catching analysts’ attention, with projections suggesting that it could rally 54,540% in 8 days. After a recent surge of 31% in just one week and 175% over the past month, the Ripple (XRP) price is gaining momentum, primarily driven by a wave of positive news. The most significant factor fueling this bullish trend is the announcement that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler will step down in January 2025. As a result, the Ripple (XRP) community may finally leave behind the lengthy regulatory battles it has faced. Ripple (XRP), now trading at $1.46, could be poised for an explosive rally as the regulatory landscape shifts to a more favorable stance. If the Ripple (XRP) cryptocurrency breaks free from its recent bearish trend, analysts predict it could soar by 54,540% in the coming days. Conclusion The forecasted 54,540% surge in 8 days, wallet features, and the low WallitIQ (WLTQ) price at $0.0171 draw savvy investors to its presale. Currently priced at an affordable $0.0171 , the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale will jump to $0.0243 in the next stage, making now the perfect time to secure a stake before it skyrockets.

37181319,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622210,1733256007,"Tokenization could help stamp vice, projected to beat the $340 billion mark by 2027","Digital fraud is on the rise and according to a Global Payments (GP) report, could surpass the $340 billion mark by 2027. But amid the gloomy forecast, lies a glimmer of hope: tokenization. Per the study, payment cryptographs — tokenization — can be a crucial ally in combating the runaway scams bedeviling the e-commerce sector. GP suggests that tokenization when fully exploited, can ensure timely and secure transaction completion. Through it, users can use biometrics and passkeys to unlock devices linked to their payment credentials. Thus, they act as a barrier to unauthorized access to one’s transactional data. The report states: Tokenization converts sensitive data into unique digital tokens that can be securely and efficiently transmitted over borders using standard definitions, reducing the need for complex verification processes. ~ Global Payments report GP’s findings also highlighted the centrality of the payment cryptographs to the global e-commerce sector. The firm reckons that the tokenization technology will account for $290 billion of the sector’s transactions by 2030. This potential has prompted major players, such as Amazon, to adopt tokenization. The tech giant is testing its Amazon Payments Cryptography Service which it intends to use in automating and consolidating its payment functions. America lags in fighting e-commerce fraud Interestingly, the report shows that the US is lagging behind Europe and Asia in its efforts to thwart digital fraud. This situation is due to the country’s fragmented market and its slower uptake of new standards. But that is changing now with the payments sector’s adoption of new tech such as passkeys. That’s an assertion that Amazon’s Senior Operations Lead Mark Smith concurs with. He suggests that the American payment industry was finding ways to modernize its infrastructure after years of following a different tangent. Smith’s views seem to resonate with Visa’s Head of Consumer Products, Marc Nelsen. He held that US banks delayed adopting self-authentication on mobile apps. That situation contrasts with Europe, where regulations require robust customer identification, leading to lower fraud rates. America’s shift in managing online scams draws from the increase in AI-based con games. The power of technology allows ill-intentioned actors to try mass phishing individuals and businesses. AI could be the key to taming growing phishing attempts Global Payments’ report also indicates that phishing attacks have increased with the continued adoption of remote work and artificial intelligence (AI). Traditional multi-factor authentication methods have struggled to keep pace with these advancements. In light of this development, the report calls for concerted efforts to fight this vice. It concludes that digital fraud taxes everyone by passing on the service costs to the end users. Through its ability to intelligently score risks and undertake behavioral analysis, AI offers firms the means for stemming payment fraud.

However, according to an expert’s post on X (formerly Twitter), Trump has reached out to Atkin for the SEC position, but the agency is still awaiting confirmation. Despite the lack of official confirmation, the buzz has influenced market sentiment. Altcoins like XRP, BNB, and XLM have seen modest gains of 3.4%, 3.2%, and 4.15%, respectively, as traders speculate on a more crypto-friendly SEC under Atkin’s potential leadership. Who is Paul Atkin? However, Atkin is a former SEC Commissioner who served under President George W. Bush from 2002 to 2008. He has been vocal in his support of the crypto industry and was the first libertarian to serve as an SEC Commissioner. Known for his innovative approach and crypto expertise, Atkin is regarded as capable of “returning the agency to the so-called gold standard,” according to a crypto expert on X (formerly Twitter).",NEUTRAL,BNB,ALTCOIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/donald-trump-appoints-paul-atkin-as-new-sec-chair-fact-or-rumor/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

In a new interview with CNN’s Inside Politics, Wood says Trump will likely usher in more business-friendly regulations for artificial intelligence (AI), digital assets and other tech-related businesses, causing them to flourish. “In the last four years, we saw massive concentration towards very few stocks. I think the market’s going to broaden out right now and reward companies who are at the leading edge of innovation, not just those who have already been very successful… We think it’s going to help small and medium businesses.” Wood says that US regulations on crypto, in particular, have hampered the country’s ability to lead in the sector. She also blames outgoing U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler’s aggressive position on digital assets for hurting the crypto sector. “I think the biggest problem we have is regulation, too much regulation, and we as a country, the US, almost lost our footing in the cryptocurrency world… Chairman Gary Gensler at the SEC didn’t think it was safe or what have you. And so we drove a lot of talent away from the United States. We think that’s going to change with a focus on crypto and AI. There are five major platforms evolving in the world today. I mentioned AI as the biggest platform shift. Crypto, or we call it blockchain technology, digital assets, is the second. Robotics, energy storage and multiomic sequencing. Those are all technology platforms that the US must seize and harness really, and lead the way, much like we did in the Internet. We were about to lose that given our regulatory system. And I think a change in the regulatory system with both crypto and AI as prime focuses is going to be quite meaningful.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Dtcpay’s Shift to Stablecoins: Key Reasons Behind the Transition According to the company’s announcement , this transition is attributed to the price fluctuations of Bitcoin and Ethereum , which have created challenges for users seeking consistency in digital payments. 1/ Major Announcement: dtcpay Will Support #Stablecoin & Fiat #Payments Starting January 2025 As we wrap up 2024, dtcpay is excited to announce that, starting Jan 2025, we will transition to only support stablecoins for all our Digital Payment Token ( #DPT ) payment services. pic.twitter.com/lCrWuJdHeZ — dtcpay (@dtc_pay) December 3, 2024 The company plans to center its offerings around stablecoins such as USDT (Tether) and USDC (USD Coin), with additional support for FDUSD (First Digital USD) and WUSD (Worldwide USD) in the pipeline. These stablecoins, pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, ensure consistent value, making them a practical alternative for retail and institutional users. This decision reflects a broader trend in digital payments. In Singapore, stablecoin adoption has surged significantly, with transaction volumes nearly doubling to $1 billion in Q2 2024, according to a Chainalysis report . Source: Chainalysis The stability of these assets has made them increasingly popular for smaller, everyday transactions that dominate the retail market. Source: Chainalysis Regulatory advancements in Singapore have further supported this shift. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) introduced a framework in late 2023 to enhance the stability of single-currency stablecoins, particularly those pegged to the Singapore dollar or other G10 currencies. These developments create a conducive environment for stablecoin adoption. Driving Stablecoin Adoption in Singapore’s Payment Ecosystem Dtcpay’s pivot to stablecoins aligns with its vision to improve scalability and interoperability in payment services. As part of this transition, the company plans to integrate FDUSD, which operates on Ethereum and Binance-backed BNB Chain, and WUSD, pegged to the U.S. dollar. This shift comes after securing a payment institution license from MAS in 2022 and forming partnerships with major entities like Pontiac Land. The stablecoin trend isn’t limited to Singapore alone. Globally, their adoption is on the rise, especially in banking sectors across Asia, the Middle East, and Europe.

In an announcement, Coinbase says that it has added MOG Coin ( MOG ) to its listing roadmap, which the exchange uses for transparency and to prevent insider trading on coins prior to them being listed. The announcement means the firm has determined the asset will likely be available for trading in the near future. MOG is trading for $0.000002414 at time of writing, up more than 8,776% in the last year. With a market cap of $944.5 million, Mog Coin is the 138th largest crypto project. MOG, which is available on both the Ethereum ( ETH ) and Base blockchains, is already listed on crypto exchanges such as Kraken, Gate, Bybit and Bitstamp. The project calls the digital asset “the internet’s first culture coin.” The name of the memecoin is derived from AMOG, which means the “alpha male of the group,” and its symbol is a “joycat.” “The idea for Mog began as a fun meme among friends, and in the Summer of 2023 the token was launched as a fair launch memecoin via a Uniswap V2 LP. Although it started as a joke among friends, when the project went live it became immediately clear that something truly special had been created. Mog immediately set itself apart from other projects through its open-ended memetic branding and unique content. The cultural underpinning of Mog, effortless cosmic domination, is an idea and mentality that anyone can adopt, and can be applied to any situation in life.” Coinbase also recently announced it added the new Solana ( SOL )-based memecoin Moo Deng ( MOODENG ) to its listing roadmap.

According to the latest report by Unchained, Trump has reached out to the former SEC commissioner. However, as at the time of writing, Paul Atkins had not officially commented on the selection. Laura Shin, crypto journalist and host of the Unchained podcast, shared the breaking news via X on Dec. 3. Laura Shin @laurashin · Follow 🚨 SCOOP: Trump Taps Paul Atkins for Next SEC Chair, Making Good on His Crypto PromisesAtkins has been vocal in his support of the industry and was the first libertarian to serve as an SEC commissioner under President George W. Bush.by @vronirwin (link in next tweet) 8:16 pm · 3 Dec 2024 282 Reply Copy link Read 20 replies Trump eyes Paul Atkins for SEC Chair’s role The news follows reports that Trump was set to pick a new chair to replace the outgoing Gensler at the helm of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Gensler, increasingly unpopular throughout his tenure at the SEC, announced his departure from the agency two weeks ago. In his announcement, the exiting SEC chair noted he would be stepping down on January 20, 2025 – the day Trump is inaugurated into office for another term as the 47 th president of the United States. Notably, Trump promised to fire Gensler “on day one” in office. But with the resignation in, the attention has over the past few weeks focused on who could replace him. Atkins, who was SEC commissioner between 2002 and 2008, is a pro-crypto candidate that had been widely tipped to take over. The selection by Donald Trump means the incoming administration is keen on getting the ball rolling in the crypto space after a “regulation by enforcement” approach plagued Gensler’s reign. Major crypto news in the US These include lawsuits against crypto companies, exchanges, protocols and individuals. The high profile cases include the legal tussle with Ripple Labs over the XRP token, which the SEC claimed was a security. Others are lawsuits against Coinbase, Kraken and Binance and Wells Notices against NFT platform OpenSea and trading platform Robinhood. Atkins’ potential approval as the next SEC chair is one of the many early positive signals from the Trump team that the next four years may be different for the US crypto industry. There are also plans to have a “crypto czar”, while lawmakers are also looking to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve for the US. Cryptocurrencies have rallied since Trump’s election with Bitcoin surging to near $100,000. XRP has however been on a rollercoaster since Gensler announced his departure and has risen more than 400% in the past 30 days.

Alphractal’s Adjusted Sharpe Ratio indicator is approaching the Extreme Risk zone, indicating significant potential for near-term price volatility. The company urged investors to prepare for unpredictable moves as XRP approaches this critical threshold. The Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric is at 0.63, placing the market between the “Belief” and “Denial” phases. Historically, analysts have said that when NUPL reaches 0.7, it aligns with market tops, indicating that XRP may be entering overheated territory.

All of them have impressive features that could make a significant mark on the digital economy, but which one is truly poised for greatness in the near future? While Tron and Cronos are established projects, Qubetics is making waves with its recent milestones, especially as it surges into its 11th presale stage with $4.2 million raised, more than 261 million $TICS tokens sold, and over 5,900 holders. With the presale price currently at $0.0282, analysts predict a potential 871% ROI by the end of the presale and even greater returns once the mainnet launches. So, why is everyone talking about these three? Let’s dive into each one and see how they stack up in the race for dominance in the blockchain world. Qubetics: The New Contender in Town Qubetics has already raised over $4.2 million in its 11th presale stage. The project is shaking up the crypto space with its Layer 1 Web3 aggregated blockchain, designed to unify all blockchain networks—including Bitcoin—through chain abstraction. That’s right, Qubetics is enabling EVM, Wasm, and Bitcoin compatibility, making it a truly versatile solution for the digital economy. What makes Qubetics truly stand out, however, is the combination of its QubeQode IDE and its focus on real-world applications. The QubeQode interface makes blockchain development easy, even for beginners. It’s like a drag-and-drop builder for decentralized applications (dApps), powered by AI. Think of it as the WordPress of blockchain development—and it’s here to revolutionize how we interact with blockchain technology. With over 6,000 token holders and analysts predicting $TICS will surge to $0.25 at the end of the presale, the potential returns are staggering. Imagine entering the presale at $0.0282 and watching your investment soar as Qubetics becomes the next big thing. For example, a $10,000 investment at the current presale price could see you holding 354,000 $TICS tokens. At the projected $0.25 price per token, that could result in $88,500—an ROI of over 785%. And if Qubetics hits its $15 target after the mainnet launch, well… you do the math. But it’s not just the price action that’s grabbing attention. Qubetics is also addressing critical problems in scalability, security, and interoperability, all while making digital finance and tokenized asset trading more accessible. It’s solving real-world problems and promising decentralised VPN , and that’s something investors are starting to take seriously. For more information, watch this video . Tron: A Veteran With Momentum Tron has been around for a while now, and with good reason: it’s a blockchain that has built a reputation for offering fast transactions and low fees. Initially created by Justin Sun in 2017, Tron is an Ethereum competitor that allows for the decentralised creation and management of digital content. What makes it special is its ability to handle thousands of transactions per second (TPS), making it ideal for content creators, streaming services, and other dApp developers. But lately, Tron has been looking even better. With its TRX token and continuous developments, including collaborations with major companies like BitTorrent, the platform is seeing increasing adoption. As of today, Tron is making strides with its DeFi ecosystem, and it’s positioning itself as an important player in the NFT space. Many investors are eyeing it as a reliable long-term hold due to its liquidity and transactional scalability. If you’re someone who prefers a more established crypto asset with a proven track record, Tron could be a safer bet. The project’s price currently hovers around $0.23, but analysts expect it to break out in the coming months, especially as its dApp ecosystem grows. Cronos: The Blockchain for DeFi and NFTs Now let’s talk about Cronos—a rising star in the DeFi and NFT space. Cronos is the native blockchain of Crypto.com, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. It’s a layer-1 chain that aims to bridge DeFi and traditional finance, providing developers with fast, low-cost transactions. While Cronos has had a steady rise since its inception in 2018, its focus on scalability and interoperability makes it a serious contender in the race for DeFi dominance. Cronos allows projects to interact with Ethereum, Cosmos, and other blockchain ecosystems, ensuring that it’s able to tap into multiple chains. In fact, Cronos is known for its low fees, speed, and robust security. It’s built with developers in mind, offering easy integration with dApps and decentralized exchanges. For those who are already invested in Crypto.com, Cronos is a natural choice. The platform’s CRO token has seen consistent growth, and as the DeFi space expands, so too will Cronos’ ecosystem. While Cronos offers a compelling use case in the DeFi and NFT spaces, it’s important to note that Qubetics’ cross-chain vision and innovative tools like QubeQode set it apart by tackling a wider range of blockchain issues. Conclusion: Why Qubetics Is the Best Bet Right Now While Tron and Cronos have carved out strong niches in the crypto market, Qubetics is a game-changer with its multi-blockchain compatibility and groundbreaking QubeQode IDE. The ongoing presale, now in its 11th stage, has already raised over $4.2 million, and the price of $TICS is still incredibly low at $0.0282. Qubetics is not just a cryptocurrency; it’s the future of the digital economy. With its $TICS token set to surge to $0.25 after the presale and the mainnet launch predicted to take it all the way to $15, now is the time to get in. Don’t miss out on the chance to be part of something huge—Qubetics is the best ongoing presale to buy now, and it’s not too late to secure your place before the price skyrockets. Ready to jump in? Get in on the Qubetics presale today and start your journey to massive gains!

37180092,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622196,1733253004,"The Browser Company’s DIA enters AI browser race with Microsoft Edge, Brave, and Opera","The Browser Company, the developer of the popular Arc browser provided information about the launch of Dia, its AI-powered web browser in 2025. The firm’s CEO, Josh Miller had previously teased the launch of an AI product in October. Yesterday’s video ended the speculation as the firm revealed its AI productivity browser, Dia. The message on Dia’s website homepage: “AI won’t exist as an app. Or a button. We believe it’ll be an entirely new environment — built on top of a web browser,” suggests that The Browser Company is keen on integrating AI into its product line. This AI integration would be following in the footsteps of other browsers like Microsoft Edge and Brave. The Browser Company shares ambitious plans for Dia AI browser According to The Browser Company, Dia is a web browser built to help users with everyday tasks using AI straight from the browser. It also teased features such as the “Write the next line” feature, which is similar to an advanced version of the AI chatbots by searching the internet and pulling contextual information. Other features advertised in the browser include workflow automation, such as assisting with emails, and shopping, among other things. The emphasis on automation is a tip of the hat to repetitive task reduction, a trend being advertised in the new generation of browsers that serve as productivity tools rather than just applications to surf the internet. With its Dia browser, the Browser Company is looking to take a bite of the blossoming AI apple. Its latest AI venture comes on the heels of a successful series A earlier this year, which raised about $50 million and brought the firm’s valuation to $550 million. Speaking about the future of the Arc browser, CEO Miller says the company has no plans to kill it. However, he hinted that it may be phased out naturally, saying, “In my bones, I feel like this is so obviously where the world’s going.” Competition and ethical concerns stand in the way of AI browsers While the idea of AI-powered browsers looks novel, Dia enters a competitive market. Established players like Microsoft Edge, Brave, and Opera browsers were earlier to the party. Edge hangs its hat on productivity by focusing on summarization and content creation. Brave appeals to users concerned about privacy with its LEO AI assistant, while Opera integrates with ChatGPT. By far, Microsoft Edge appears to have the biggest lead in the AI browser race, taking advantage of its large ecosystem and superior cross-platform operability. There are also reports of OpenAI considering developing a web browser that would integrate deeply with users’ online experience. If it goes down that path, it could also potentially intensify the competition in the AI browser space. While AI browsers could bring various AI capabilities closer to everyday users as part of their internet surfing experience, there are also several pressing questions about AI ethics and data privacy. Dia and other AI browsers would rely heavily on user data to automate tasks like document handling and email generation. This would also exponentially increase the risks of data privacy law breaches and misuse.

37179978,https://crypto.news/?p=14315918,1733252974,Donald Trump may tap Paul Atkins as SEC chair,"Bitcoin rebounded above $95,500 after President Donald Trump selected Paul Atkins as the new chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. President-elect Donald Trump is reportedly set on naming former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins to replace outgoing chair Gary Gensler at the top of the federal securities watchdog, according to sources with inside knowledge on the matter. Atkins has been a vocal supporter of the crypto industry, and many believe he could stem the scorched earth approach employed by the SEC during chair Gensler’s four years in charge. Ahead of Trump’s January inauguration, Gensler announced his resignation , much to the delight of blockchain proponents who felt hard done by his anti-crypto litigation agenda. The general crypto social media consensus suggested that Atkins is well endorsed by industry leaders, who expect fresh SEC leadership under Trump’s administration. Atkins was named as Trump’s preferred pick for the position over the past few weeks, and the President’s team even contacted the ex-SEC official to discuss the role. However, Atkins is hesitant to accept Trump’s offer, Coindesk reported . Insiders reportedly noted Atkins was reluctant to undo Gensler’s mess, a stance shared by former Commodity Futures Trading Commission chair Chris Giancarlo, who was also mentioned as a possible SEC chair candidate. As for reports that I’m in mix to run @SECGov , I’ve made clear that I’ve already cleaned up earlier Gary Gensler mess @CFTC and don’t want to have do it again. DC rumors that I’m interested in some #crypto role @USTreasury are also wrong. — Chris Giancarlo (@giancarloMKTS) November 14, 2024 You might also like: Former commissioner Paul Atkins is top candidate for SEC chair Should Atkins refuse the appointment, at least two other crypto-savvy candidates have been mentioned in the mix. Former Binance U.S. CEO Brian Brooks and securities law expert Teressa Goody Guillén were named as potential options. EX-SEC official and Robinhood Markets CLO Dan Gallagher was also in contention before dropping out of the pool last month. Current SEC Commissioners Mark Uyeda and Hester Peirce were floated as potential Gensler replacements, but crypto lawyer Jakes Chervinsky downplayed the chances. Chervinsky thinks President Trump would rather appoint a new official. Very low, only because I don’t think she wants the job. I’d give decent odds to Uyeda, although I expect Trump may prefer to bring in someone new of his own. — Jake Chervinsky (@jchervinsky) November 6, 2024 Despite uncertainty over Atkins’s decision, the industry is confident that Trump will nominate a pro-crypto official as his SEC chair when he takes office next month. The President and his transition team have also explored appointing the first U.S. crypto czar to spearhead digital asset policy in Washington.

By sourcing liquidity from on-chain and off-chain venues, Perennial Intents is delivering deeper markets, better prices, and a unified trading experience designed to move DeFi forward. Tackling DeFi’s Liquidity Fragmentation “Perennial Intents arrive at a pivotal time for DeFi,” said Kevin Britz, Founder of Perennial. “Despite its growth, only a fraction of crypto’s order flow happens on-chain, most of which is fragmented across hundreds of L1s and L2s. The rise of appchains and isolated AMMs has led to over 100 chains with $10M+ in TVL ( DeFiLlama ), each operating its own siloed financial ecosystem. This fragmented liquidity leads to worse trade execution, with higher costs, increased slippage, and limited leverage opportunities.” According to the team, Perennial Intents address these challenges by consolidating order flow into a unified liquidity layer. Instead of fragmenting liquidity into silos like appchains or AMM pools, intent-based trading integrates order flow across multiple venues, creating a more cohesive and efficient system. A Hybrid Model for the Future of DeFi Although intents are not new to DeFi, Perennial Intents introduce a layered model that combines intent-based off-chain order matching with on-chain AMM settlement. Perennial claims this model streamlines trading by pairing intent-based order matching with on-chain AMM settlement. The team claims this hybrid approach guarantees optimal price execution for traders while enabling solvers to dynamically manage liquidity without long-term collateral constraints—unlocking deeper markets and greater efficiency. One-Click Trading and the Perennial Petals Program Alongside Perennial Intents, the launch includes two additional upgrades: one-click trading and the Perennial Petals points program. Traders can now enjoy seamless trading with a single collateral account, while the Petals program rewards users with points for their trading activity, with 2x points available during the initial launch period. The team at Arbitrum shared their excitement for the launch, highlighting the transformative potential of intent-based derivatives. “Perennial’s work with intent-based derivatives is transforming DeFi by aligning market interactions with users’ specific goals,” said Peter Haymond, Senior Partnerships Manager at Offchain Labs. “This approach lets users define their desired financial outcomes, enabling more efficient and personalized trading on Arbitrum.”. About Perennial Perennial is a DeFi-native derivatives primitive designed to serve as the liquidity backbone for DeFi. Backed by leading investors, including Polychain, Variant, and Archetype, Perennial has facilitated over $2.8 billion in trading volume.

South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law in a seemingly politically motivated move, prompting the military to attempt to enter parliament in Seoul. However, shortly thereafter, every single member of Korean parliament voted against the president’s declaration, making it invalid. During the commotion, BTC prices in KRW dipped dramatically. Says Korean-based CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, “South Korea’s financial markets are in chaos because of the president’s political show.” Source: Ki Young Ju/X Traders often watch the price of Bitcoin in South Korea to spot arbitrage opportunities with the “kimchi premium,” which refers to the gap between BTC’s price in the country and US markets. According to Ju, the political scuffle in Seoul pushed the kimchi premium down to all-time lows. “Bitcoin kimchi premium hits an all-time low. Shouldn’t Bitcoin go up during times of political instability? Why did the people selling now even buy Bitcoin in the first place?” Source: Ki Young Ju/X According to blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain, many whales deposited stablecoins into Upbit, one of South Korea’s largest crypto exchanges, trying to catch “bottom-fishing opportunities” amid the price crash in Bitcoin. “The Korean crypto market has plummeted following South Korea’s declaration of ‘martial law.’ Many whales transferred large amounts of USDT to Upbit, likely aiming for bottom-fishing opportunities. Within 1 hour after the declaration of ‘martial law’ over 163M USDT flowed into Upbit.” Source: Lookonchain/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $95,772.

Coinbase Cuts Ties with Milbank In a post on X, Armstrong revealed that Coinbase severed ties with Milbank following the latter’s decision to hire Gurbir Grewal, the former SEC enforcement director. The SEC had announced on October 2 that Grewal would step down, highlighting his role in recommending over 100 enforcement actions against noncompliance in the digital asset sector. By October 15th, Milbank welcomed Grewal to its litigation and arbitration team, with chairman Scott Edelman commending his accomplishments as a federal prosecutor and SEC official. Armstrong stated that this hiring prompted Coinbase to discontinue its relationship with the law firm. The Coinbase exec criticized senior figures within the agency for allegedly attempting to stifle the crypto sector without clear regulatory guidance, noting that some SEC staff chose to leave rather than participate in what he deems an “abnormal” tenure. While clarifying that he opposes “permanently canceling people,” Armstrong called on the crypto industry to collectively refuse to fund individuals whose past actions contributed to what he described as regulatory overreach. Coinbase CEO Aligns With Trump Team Armstrong had previously championed pro-crypto figures in government, backing Hester Peirce to lead the SEC. This mirrors the exchange’s hefty $100 million in political donations, including $40 million to Fairshake PAC. Although Armstrong refrained from directly supporting Trump’s campaign, his approval of policies like D.O.G.E. highlights an openness to cooperating with the President-elect’s administration. Last month, CryptoPotato reported that Armstrong is expected to meet privately with Trump to discuss high-profile government appointments crucial to the crypto industry, such as Treasury Secretary and SEC chair. Trump’s transition team reportedly arranged the meeting, reflecting the administration’s pro-crypto stance.

JUST IN: Trump has reportedly selected Paul Atkins as his choice for SEC Chair, according to Unchained Crypto. Atkins often advocated for a more measured and less intrusive approach to financial regulation. He has been a vocal critic of overregulation. This is bullish! pic.twitter.com/NWcdLNMWxM — Satoshi Club (@esatoshiclub) December 3, 2024 Sources close to the matter told Unchained on Tuesday that Trump is finalizing his decision, with an announcement expected as soon as today. Crypto Community Welcomes Atkins’ Return Atkins, who served as an SEC commissioner from 2002 to 2008 under presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, is regarded as a crypto-friendly figure. Currently the CEO of Patomak Global Partners, a consultancy advising banks, cryptocurrency companies, and financial trading firms, Atkins is recognized for his extensive regulatory experience. His selection has been widely interpreted as a nod to Trump’s campaign promise to support cryptocurrency innovation and provide clearer regulatory guidelines. Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett had teased the potential announcement in a December 2 X post , writing, “NEW: @realDonaldTrump’s pick to replace @GaryGensler as @SECGov Chair could be announced as soon as tomorrow. Stay tuned.” NEW: @realDonaldTrump ’s pick to replace @GaryGensler as @SECGov Chair could be announced as soon as tomorrow, sources tell @FoxBusiness . Stay tuned . — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) December 3, 2024 Gensler’s Departure Ends Controversial Tenure Gensler announced his resignation last month , effective January 20, the day of Trump’s inauguration. His time as SEC chair has been defined by an aggressive enforcement stance toward the cryptocurrency industry, targeting companies such as Ripple, Coinbase, and Kraken for alleged violations of securities laws. While praised by some for maintaining the SEC’s hardline approach, Gensler faced criticism for a lack of clarity in digital asset regulations . @GaryGensler to step down as @SECGov Chair in January 2025, concluding a term of bold enforcement actions in the crypto space. #CryptoRegulations #GaryGensler #SEC https://t.co/iKmVa3QkSM — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 21, 2024 In his farewell statement , Gensler expressed gratitude for his tenure, saying, “The Securities and Exchange Commission is a remarkable agency. It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve with them on behalf of everyday Americans.” Atkins’ nomination is seen as part of a broader overhaul of the SEC’s leadership. In addition to Gensler’s departure, Democratic commissioner Jaime Lizárraga has announced his intention to step down in January, leaving the agency with two Republican commissioners, Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda, and one Democrat, Caroline Crenshaw. Crenshaw’s term is also set to expire, giving Trump the ability to reshape the SEC’s composition and policy direction. Peirce and Uyeda, known for their pro-market stances, have also been floated as potential candidates for the chair position. However, Atkins’ longstanding experience and industry ties make him a strong frontrunner. A Pro-Crypto Future for U.S. Regulation? Atkins’ potential appointment has generated optimism within the cryptocurrency sector, where Gensler’s enforcement-driven policies were seen as a hindrance to innovation. Atkins, by contrast, is expected to adopt a more collaborative approach, focusing on providing clear guidelines for compliance rather than pursuing punitive actions. Trump’s selection reflects a strategic shift in U.S. regulatory policy, with an emphasis on positioning the country as a global leader in digital finance. While the success of Atkins in achieving this vision is not guaranteed, his background shows an inclination to collaborate with the industry.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. A $25K Ethereum prediction fuels market excitement, with XRP eyeing $3.8 and WallitIQ set to soar from $0.01 to $30. Table of Contents WallitIQ presents the best market gains in the brewing bull run Ethereum price set to rise massively to $25,000 as analyst predicts XRP price set to reclaim $3.8 amid positive developments in the SEC case Conclusion A $25,000 analyst prediction on the Ethereum price has sparked excitement in the market as the altcoin shows strength amid recent trends. As the market eyes a potential Ethereum price rally, the XRP price is also poised for a significant price rebound towards $3.8. However, new presale star WallitIQ (WLTQ) is emerging as the standout opportunity in the crypto market amid analyst predictions of a price jump from $0.01 to $30. WallitIQ (WLTQ) presents a rare presale opportunity for early investors to capitalize on life-changing returns in this brewing bull market. You might also like: Crypto whales eye PEPE at $2, but experts predict WallitIQ will hit $15 by 2024’s end WallitIQ presents the best market gains in the brewing bull run Although Ethereum (ETH) and the XRP price have the potential for a price surge, WallitIQ (WLTQ) presents a better opportunity to profit from its ongoing presale. Presales are known as one of the best profit possibilities in the crypto market. However, venture capitalist firms and angel investors willing to buy in on early projects have swallowed these opportunities in recent years. With WallitIQ, the public presale again brings this opportunity to the broader market. This opportunity enables investors to buy early into an exciting project introducing a unique crypto wallet solution integrating artificial intelligence. Capitalizing on artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, WallitIQ aims to solve core issues related to security, user experience, and financial literacy in the decentralized wallet ecosystem. WallitIQ will also introduce unique intelligent security solutions, personalization features, and educational resources to provide a straightforward solution to identified issues with existing crypto wallets. However, the uniqueness of this wallet solution shines via other unique features such as smart transactions, predictive analytics, market insights, AI chatbot, and many more. Analyst insights suggest that WallitIQ may be the breakout star of this bull run. With predictions of a price surge to $30 from its presale price of $0.00171, the profit margin presents a potential that rivals the best rises the market has ever seen. The prospects of the new coin reassure investors of making insane gains amid the bullish market trends. Furthermore, the WallitIQ smart contract has passed an audit by SolidProof , and the coin is already listed on CoinMarketCap . The early signs align for a massive price surge on WallitIQ, and its ongoing presale is the best opportunity. Ethereum price set to rise massively to $25,000 as analyst predicts The Ethereum price is trading above $3,500 for the first time since July when market excitement was high for the launch of Spot Ethereum ETFs. Analyst insights suggest the recent trend could indicate a brewing rally after months of underwhelming performance. As Bitcoin (BTC) consolidates ahead of a surge to $100,000, the Ethereum price is gaining momentum to kickstart its rally. As of this writing, the Ethereum price is $3,566, with a 5% surge in the past week. With investors eyeing an altcoin season in the coming months, analyst predictions set a $25,000 target for the Ethereum price. XRP price set to reclaim $3.8 amid positive developments in the SEC case The XRP price has shocked crypto enthusiasts in recent weeks. It has been hitting a bullish trend since Donald Trump’s victory in the US elections earlier in November. Since then, the price has seen a 200% gain as investors anticipate a possible end to the four-year-long Ripple—SEC battle. With an end to the conflict on the horizon, investors are anticipating an XRP price surge to massive highs in this bull run. As of this writing, the XRP price is at $1.66, a price level that has not been seen since 2021. Conclusion WallitIQ , Ethereum, and the XRP price present exciting market opportunities to target in this bull run. However, WallitIQ appears to be the favorite for obvious reasons. Analysts’ predictions for the new presale star tease a potential return of over 30,000% for early investors. The profit margin is a contender for the best gains in this brewing market, and it would be a mistake not to buy in early. Buy WLTQ on the ongoing presale at $0.0171 before the presale price rises to $0.0243 in the next stage.

37179704,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/network3s-decentralized-edgeai-framework-solves-legacy-ai-infra-risks,1733252276,Network3’s decentralized EdgeAI framework solves legacy AI Infra risks,"AI Infra is one of the most critical components or layers of the AI stack. Like PaaS in Cloud Computing, it connects the foundational AI Computing layer with the user-facing App layer. Thus AI systems cannot function without efficient Infra. Yet currently, a few Big Tech firms like OpenAI, IBM, Amazon, and Google have a monopoly over this layer (alongside every other). AI access for millions of users and 72% of global enterprises depends on these firms as a result. Decentralized EdgeAI can fix this, offsetting centralized dominance to improve democratization and accessibility. Network3 , for example, combines Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN), EdgeAI, and AI Infra to enable privacy-preserving, community-led AI that runs on any device. AI that runs anywhere Besides security and privacy concerns, extensive resource usage is a key downside of BigAI systems. Training LLMs like GPT-3 costs anywhere between $500K to $4.6 million for example. This raises the barrier to high for smaller entities, further consolidating Big Tech’s monopoly. With EdgeAI, however, devs can train and deploy models on smaller devices—anything from smartphones to IoT appliances. One, it reduces dependence on big servers and data centers owned by giants. And two, it broadens accessibility. However, unless devices running EdgeAI can communicate or share resources, AI systems only have access to limited computation and storage. This impedes their growth and efficiency. Towards collaborative AI Moving beyond existing model development methods like Federated Learning, Distributed Deep Learning, etc., Network3’s innovative Decentralized Federated Learning framework fosters collaborative AI training. DePIN and EdgeAI meet in this new paradigm, enabling multiple devices or ‘nodes’ to pool compute and other resources. Moreover, Anonymous Certificateless Signcryption (CLSC) facilitates private data sharing secured with strong homomorphic encryption. The framework also uses Reed-Solomon coding for optimal data accuracy coupled with anti-tracking features. Edge devices in the Network3 ecosystem perform local analysis, resulting in low latency and real-time response systems. They also transmit only model updates, reducing bandwidth requirements and making devices functional with limited bandwidth. Decentralized EdgeAI Infra thus marks a major shift in community-led AI, tackling centralized monopoly and resource crunch in one fell swoop. Moreover, the integration of crypto assets and blockchain economics unlocks novel revenue streams for devs and users. Besides monetizing excess compute and storage on personal devices, they get ‘Prompt-to-Earn’ and other income-generation models. Last but not least, Network3’s Local LLM is free to use across the globe, without any regional barriers. This reflects the degree to which decentralized Infra improves AI access. AI is one of the most powerful and groundbreaking technologies since the Internet. Everyone, from the smallest individual to the biggest corporation must reap its benefits, without any single party extracting outsized gains. The future lies in AI systems that everyone owns, without being owned by anyone. That’s the only way AI can benefit humanity as a whole—the ideal purpose of a technology this powerful.

Donald vs Israel (DONISRA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONISRA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Donald vs Israel can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald vs Israel could become the next viral memecoin. Donald vs Israel launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Donald vs Israel on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald vs Israel by entering its contract address – CKYA6Q1KcWsSJyXgFKwyNXyTAjHD1dRPKTDD2FTUFryn – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONISRA.

Alts have started outperforming BTC , and analysts expect the trend to continue in the coming months. Arbitrum (ARB) is among the tokens capitalizing on the improving trends with notable price actions. The altcoin gained nearly 20% within the past week, and on-chain observations support more upswings. The latest announcement shows that Arbitrum One has become the first layer2 project to hit $20 billion in total value locked.

The 20 billion TVL makes ARB’s ecosystem perfect for decentralized finance activities, positioning the native token for significant growth. ARB price outlook The altcoin trades at $1.01 after a nearly 5% gain on its daily chart. Arbitrum exhibits massive bullish momentum, hinting at continued surges. Source: Coinmarketcap For instance, the 50% uptick in 24-hour trading volume suggests amplified trader optimism, which could support extended gains. Moreover, the latest uptrends saw ARB overcoming the crucial resistance range at $0.96 – $0.98. That opened the path for more upsides to $2.4 – where immense liquidity exists. That would mean a remarkable 137% price increase from current values. The broad market optimism, with all eyes on the highly anticipated altcoin season, supports ARB’s upside stance. Altcoin season in play The “alt season” narrative is gaining attention as more altcoins continue to outshine Bitcoin. The altcoin season index is 80, reflecting a notable jump from 23 one month ago. Source: Coinmarketcap In that context, the altcoin season index tracks the performance of Bitcoin against the top 50 cryptocurrencies. Figures at 25 show Bitcoin dominance, whereas above 75 signal the beginning of an alt season. Meanwhile, the prevailing levels mark the highest point the altcoin season index has hit since January 2022. The phase saw massive uptrends for altcoins until March. Crypto expert Reck Capital supported this stance with his latest X post . He highlighted a declining BTC dominance, which confirmed cash flowing into the altcoin ecosystem. Furthermore, the TOTAL2 indicators, which measure the market capitalization of the top 125 alts, indicate a bull flag emerging on the 72-hour chart. Source: TradingView The bull flag is an optimistic chart setup comprising two rallies divided by a brief consolidation. The pattern starts with a steady uptrend, the flagpole, as bulls outweigh bears. A pullback follows (forming a flag) with equivalent lower and upper trendlines, supporting uptrend continuation. With this setup, TOTAL2 could skyrocket past $1.45 trillion. That would trigger explosive price gains in the altcoin space, with many tokens potentially surpassing their ATHs. Such an environment, with Arbitrum’s stable ecosystem and venture into AI , could see ARB exceeding resistances to hit the $2.4 target.

37179092,https://crypto.news/?p=14315782,1733250720,"Enron crypto initiative revival sparks curiosity, anger, concerns around parody project","Two decades after its collapse, the Enron brand is making a surprising return, this time dabbling in crypto and NFTs under a satirical rebranding. Enron is back , but only if you believe birds aren’t real. Twenty-three years after Enron became the symbol of corporate fraud , the infamous Texas-based energy giant has seemingly risen from the ashes. A polished website, vague announcements, and a press release promising to “solve the global energy crisis” have sparked speculation. The company has even hinted at launching a crypto initiative, according to trademark filings , which reference non-fungible tokens and “cryptocurrency exchange services.” But behind the flashy branding lies an unexpected twist: this is not the same Enron that fell into disgrace 20 years ago. Instead, it appears to be a satirical rebranding crafted by the same team that created the viral “Birds Aren’t Real” conspiracy , which claims that birds are actually drones used by the U.S. government to spy on people. On Dec. 2, coinciding with the anniversary of Enron’s bankruptcy filing, social media accounts under the Enron name began posting a series of announcements. We're back. Can we talk? pic.twitter.com/9kt4g0Q84Z — Enron (@Enron) December 2, 2024 The minute-long clip featured a mashup of corporate imagery: city skylines, a ballerina, and people forming the Enron logo. The newly launched website promises a company reborn with a mission to tackle global energy challenges, though details remain unclear. Stock photos, job listings, but there’s a catch For a moment, it might even seem legit. The website showcases job listings, team profiles — though some of them appear to be stock photos —, and an online store selling branded hoodies, water bottles, and polo shirts at premium prices. You might also like: FTX aftermath: Celebrities could face legal heat following Bankman-Fried verdict The current “Enron Corporation,” far from being an energy powerhouse, is the brainchild of Connor Gaydos, co-creator of the satirical “Birds Aren’t Real” movement, which claims that birds are actually government drones used for surveillance. Gaydos, who incorporated the new entity in Delaware in February, appears to have purchased the Enron trademark for $275 in 2020. The firm’s supposed job postings — like one for a nuclear systems engineer — are as tongue-in-cheek as its origins. However, the online store selling merchandise, including $118 hoodies emblazoned with “World’s Leading Company,” appears to be very real. Hello from the past Founded in 1985, Enron was deemed as an innovator in the energy industry before revelations of fraudulent accounting practices emerged. Executives had used creative bookkeeping to hide debt and inflate profits, duping investors while the company’s stock went from $90.75 at its peak to $0.26 at bankruptcy. As a result, Enron filed for bankruptcy in December 2001, leaving thousands unemployed and wiping out billions in shareholder value. Its collapse was a turning point for corporate oversight, leading to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a law designed to improve corporate accountability and prevent fraud by setting stricter rules for financial reporting and company audits. Enron chief executive Jeffrey Skilling was convicted of multiple charges, including securities fraud, and was eventually sentenced to 24 years in prison, of which he served 12 after multiple appeals. Kenneth Lay, the company’s founder, died of a heart attack before sentencing. https://twitter.com/edison0xyz/status/1863593322633453901 Given this history, the idea of an Enron comeback — particularly one linked to crypto — raises concerns. Some view the rebranding as a crime , while others see it as a pointed critique of corporate culture and the financial industry’s tendency to reinvent itself. Some of its social media posts have already been flagged as misleading, and skeptics have suggested the venture could even be a crypto scam. “More to share soon” So, what exactly is the new Enron? According to the website’s terms of use, the information on the website “is First Amendment protected parody, represents performance art and is for entertainment purposes only.” Adding to the mystique, Gaydos and his collaborator Peter McIndoe have remained silent. The media inquiries directed to the listed press contact at Stu Loeser & Co., a New York-based PR firm, have gone unanswered beyond vague promises of “more to share soon.” In the meantime, the new Enron countdown clock ticks on, promising to reveal more info on Dec. 9, and its merchandise continues to sell. Whether the venture is a clever satire, an opportunistic hustle, or both, one thing is certain: the Enron name still has the power to captivate — and polarize.

Currently trading above $95,000, the leading cryptocurrency holds a pivotal level that will likely dictate its next move. This key zone will determine whether Bitcoin regains upward momentum or seeks lower-level liquidity to establish stronger support. Related Reading: XRP Reaches 6-Year High – Whales And STH Accumulate Together Despite the recent volatility, market participants remain optimistic, as on-chain data provides fresh insights. According to CryptoQuant, a notable uptick in stablecoin transfer volumes has coincided with Bitcoin’s price action. This metric often signals increased purchasing power entering the market, a potential precursor to renewed buying interest in Bitcoin. As Bitcoin consolidates above $95,000, traders and investors closely monitor its ability to reclaim psychological resistance at $100,000. Conversely, losing support could push BTC to retest lower levels near $90,000 or even deeper liquidity zones. Bitcoin And Stablecoins: What They Have In Common? Bitcoin has achieved a remarkable milestone, staying less than 1% away from the coveted $100,000 mark, driven by a wave of institutional and retail buying. This historical rally reflects a growing global demand, with investors from various countries utilizing stablecoins to purchase BTC. Stablecoins have emerged as the preferred bridge, enabling seamless transactions across borders and currencies. According to CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler, the recent surge in stablecoin transfer volumes coincided with Bitcoin’s price ascent. This trend highlights stablecoins’ significant role in providing liquidity and driving market momentum. Cash inflows through stablecoins create robust support for Bitcoin’s price, allowing it to maintain upward pressure even as it nears critical psychological levels. The correlation between stablecoin activity and Bitcoin price action offers valuable insights into market dynamics. Increased stablecoin transfers often signal heightened demand for Bitcoin, providing a reliable indicator of potential price movements. This interplay is particularly relevant in identifying periods of high buying pressure, as stablecoins facilitate quick and efficient market participation. Related Reading: Dogecoin Ready To Hit $1 – Price Struggles To Break Above Major Resistance As Bitcoin approaches the $100,000 milestone, the continued influx of stablecoin-driven liquidity underscores the asset’s global appeal and resilience. Whether this momentum leads to a breakout above $100,000 or a period of consolidation, the role of stablecoins in fueling demand will remain pivotal in shaping Bitcoin’s price trajectory. BTC Price Nears Critical Zone Bitcoin currently holds above the crucial $95,000 level, a price that will play a decisive role in its short-term trajectory. This level acts as a psychological and technical support zone that could propel BTC toward the long-anticipated $100,000 milestone this week or delay the breakthrough until next year. For Bitcoin to breach $100K, the $95,000 level must hold for several days, allowing sufficient time to fuel demand and attract fresh liquidity. Sustained buying pressure around this range will likely enable BTC to break above the key psychological barrier, continuing its historic rally. However, the bullish momentum faces risks. A failure to hold the $95,000 level would expose BTC to a retest of $92,000, another critical support. Losing both levels could trigger a significant correction, sending Bitcoin to lower demand zones around $85,000 or sub-$ sub-$80,000. This move would sharply reverse its recent rally, shaking market confidence.

37179372,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622167,1733250623,Amazon set to pilot carbon removal tech at its data centers,"Following concerns about rising emissions from AI-related infrastructure, Amazon is reportedly planning to deploy a new material capable of removing carbon at its data centers as part of initiatives to achieve net zero by 2040. The development comes as AI firms are seized with strategies to improve energy efficiency after studies have shown that data centers’ energy consumption is too high to remain sustainable. Amazon is already seeing the benefits of the new technology Now Amazon is among the tech giants that are coming up with ways of improving the energy efficiency of their AI systems. The e-commerce giant is reportedly piloting a system it termed as “breaking new ground in carbon removal efficiency” after the material was designed and improved upon by AI itself. Describing the system, Jonathan Godwin , chief executive of climate technology startup Orbital Materials, which developed the material, said: “Each cavity in that sponge has a specific size opening that interacts well with CO2, that does not interact with other things.” “The carbon filtering substance is like a sponge at the atomic level.” Godwin. As part of a three-year partnership with Orbital, Amazon’s Web services unit, AWS, will deploy the novel material in one data center to start in 2025. Orbital uses an open-source AI model to simulate advanced materials. “Developing new advanced materials has traditionally been a slow process of trial and error in the lab,” said Amazon in a statement. “Orbital replaces this with generative AI design, radically improving the speed and efficacy of materials discovery and new technology commercialization.” Amazon. Since beginning the work of the sponge in the first quarter of 2024, Orbital has improved 10 times using AI the carbon sponge which utilizes proprietary active material. Amazon added that the carbon sponge is an order of magnitude faster than traditional development. The carbon sponge presents cost benefits for Amazon With data centers needing vast amounts of water to keep them cool, and increased energy needs to sustain the development of AI, it is becoming a huge problem for companies like Amazon that have vowed to achieve net zero carbon emissions zones by 2040. With an estimated add-up of 10% of the hourly charge to rent a GPU chip for training powerful AI, the new carbon sponge is presenting some cost benefits for Amazon and Goodwin asserted that this is only a fraction of the price of purchasing carbon offsets. No details of the financial agreements were provided by both Amazon and Orbital. However, Amazon said the deal would include providing AWS customers working on advanced materials and technologies, like semiconductors, batteries, and electronics access to Orbital’s AI model. According to Amazon, for designing, synthesizing, and testing new technologies and advanced materials for data center integrated carbon removal, chip cooling, and water utilization, AWS will also work with Orbital. This development comes amid a report by The Guardian which said big tech’s data centers have been accused of generating 662% more emissions than they have admitted to, as AI’s growth sees energy demand across the sector soar. According to the UK news site’s analysis, from 2020 to 2022 the real emissions from the in-house data centers of Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Apple were likely to be about 7.62 times higher than was officially reported, the report continued. Amazon was listed as the biggest emitter of the big five tech companies by a mile, with Apple the second biggest emitter less than half of Amazon’s in 2022. The company therefore seeks to correct these anomalies through the new carbon sponge technology being pioneered by Orbital. However Amazon in July said that it met its goal seven years early and that it had implemented a gross emissions cut of 3% meaning the company will seek to see even more better results with the carbon sponge from Orbital.

Tokenization involves creating digital tokens that are backed by financial or tangible assets, such as uranium, and recording them on an immutable blockchain ledger. These tokens represent ownership or participation in the underlying asset, ensuring that each token is tied to a physical or financial equivalent securely held in a regulated depository or custodian. In this case, Uranium acquired via the dApp is stored as physical Triuranium octoxide (U3O8), commonly referred as Yello cake, which is procured by Curzon Uranium Ltd, a prominent Uranium trading frim based in the United Kingdom. The U308 is then stored securlly by Cameco one of the leading uranium providers in the world, at a regulated depository. This ensures that every token representing uranium on the platform is fully backed by a corresponding physical quantity of U3O8, providing transparency and trust for investors. Speaking on the matter, Tezos co-founder Aurthur Breitman said in statement to media that the Uranium market actually benefits from having a “transparent, globally accessible ledger,” unlike other blockchain use cases. He emphasized that the shared ledger introduces a level of trust and accessibility that is critical for trading uranium, an asset integral to the future of energy. Breaking barriers with blockchain By leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, the platform reduces counterparty risks, and opens up uranium trading to a wider range of investors. Previously limited to institutional players via complex and costly investment instruments like exchange-traded funds , this new approach makes the market more accessible while also increasing liquidity and efficiency in uranium trading. Uranium.io comes in response to growing demand for uranium as a source of low-emission energy, driven by the global shift toward sustainable solutions. This demand has been further amplified by advancements in artificial intelligence, with companies like Microsoft exploring nuclear energy to power energy-intensive AI systems. If the dApp is a success, Breitman expects it to lay the foundation for other commodity markets to be introduced in the decentralised space. Despite the develop, the price of XTZ , the native token for the Tezos blockchain, was down 4.5% over the past 24-hours. At press time, the altcoin as trading for $1.54 with a market capitalisation of $1.57 billion.

37179407,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51281,1733250016,"Top Crypto Proponent Backs XRP To Flip Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Gold","Crypto Bitlord, a prominent cryptocurrency commentator, recently stirred the digital asset community with a bold tweet predicting an ambitious future for XRP. The tweet, which captioned a crypto market overview, highlighted XRP’s impressive price surge and outlined a vision of XRP surpassing Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), and even traditional financial benchmarks like gold. DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS NEXT ???? WE FLIP $ETH THEN WE FLIP $BTC WE FLIP GOLD THEN WE FLIP THE MOTHERFUCKING WORLD UPSIDE DOWN AND TELEPORT HOLDERS TO MARS WELCOME TO THE NEW RELIGION $XRP pic.twitter.com/sX5mmneuTl — Crypto Bitlord (@crypto_bitlord7) December 2, 2024 At the time of the tweet, XRP was trading at $2.41, representing a 28.7% increase over the last 24 hours. According to supplemental data, this rapid rise continued, with XRP reaching $2.72, marking a 43.55% daily gain. This performance has drawn widespread attention, positioning XRP as a key contender in the race for dominance in the digital asset space. XRP’s Market Position The attached image illustrates XRP maintaining its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, totaling approximately $136.58 billion. This places it below Bitcoin, with a market cap of $1.93 trillion, and Ethereum, valued at $446.24 billion. However, XRP’s dramatic price appreciation suggests an increasing momentum that could narrow the gap with its competitors. Crypto Bitlord’s statement, “WE FLIP $ETH THEN WE FLIP $BTC,” reflects growing optimism within sections of the XRP community regarding its potential to surpass Ethereum and Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization. Such projections often stem from XRP’s unique utility in cross-border payments and its adoption by financial institutions, which separates it from other cryptocurrencies primarily viewed as stores of value or platforms for decentralized applications. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Recent Developments Driving XRP’s Growth Several factors could explain XRP’s recent price rally. The digital asset has gained traction following regulatory clarity in its ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Positive outcomes in this case have likely bolstered investor confidence, prompting an influx of capital into XRP. Additionally, the increased adoption of blockchain technology in global financial systems has provided a conducive environment for assets like XRP, which prioritizes scalability and efficiency in payment solutions. The recent market rally appears to reflect broader optimism about these trends. The Broader Implications Crypto Bitlord’s assertion, “WELCOME TO THE NEW RELIGION $XRP,” underlines the fervent belief held by XRP advocates that the asset could redefine the cryptocurrency landscape. While such enthusiasm may not be universally shared, XRP’s potential to flip Ethereum and even Bitcoin depends on sustained growth, expanded use cases, and increased institutional adoption. Although surpassing Bitcoin’s market dominance remains speculative, XRP’s current trajectory underscores its resilience and potential to challenge established norms in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

CryptoQuant data confirmed that investors have withdrawn over 171,000 Bitcoin ( BTC ) from leading crypto exchanges since Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election. Mass withdrawals shorten the supply available for sell-offs, often signaling a long-term investment plan adopted by holders. While data showed staggering Bitcoin exchange outflows after President Trump’s victory, the trend extends back to 2021.

Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy has just bought another $1.5 billion BTC, and the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs also chipped in on Monday with $ 4.22 billion in BTC. MicroStrategy buys again With its latest acquisition of 15,400 BTC, worth $1.5 billion , MicroStrategy just continues to eat up a scant supply of $BTC from the market. The MicroStrategy holdings now total 402,100 BTC, bought at a price of $58,263 per Bitcoin. U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs further decrease a scant supply of $BTC Fresh on the heels of the MicroStrategy announcement, the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs bought another 4.34K BTC on Monday - further decreasing the scarce supply. As per usual, the Blackrock IBIT ETF bought the lion’s share of this with a 3.47K BTC purchase. U.S. government selling $2 billion in BTC? Amid all this strong buying, the U.S. government moved almost $2 billion in $BTC to the Coinbase Prime exchange on Monday. It’s not clear whether the objective is to sell the $BTC, but this kind of wallet movement could have been done with this aim in mind. Since the U.S. government BTC movement became apparent, it did spark a slight downward movement in the Bitcoin price, but with MicroStrategy et al., buying a similar amount, there isn’t necessarily going to be a huge dip if this indeed does become a sale. $BTC breakout approaching on short-term time frame Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart for $BTC shows that the price is still traversing inside a triangle . This means lower highs, but higher lows. Therefore, a decision moment is approaching. The tussle between the bulls and the bears has to end with one of them the victor, and as it stands, it is still not certain which it will be. In the bull’s favour, the general trend is still up, and momentum indicators are coming down in preparation for the next swing to the upside. Also, as mentioned above, there is plenty of strong buying still taking place. For the bears, there is the slow decline from the all-time high, which could end up in a full-blown roll over for Bitcoin. In addition, the price is currently approaching the bottom of the triangle, and could break to the downside. All this considered, it is probably best to watch the price closely over these next few hours and days. If the price does fall down through the bottom of the triangle, there are the 0.618 and 0.786 fibonacci levels which could act as support, and the horizontal support level at $91,700. Whereas a dip below $90,800 would result in a lower low, and a possible descent to much lower levels. Momentum indicators turning bearish on weekly time frame Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $BTC shows a clear picture. It could be that the price is going to come back down to retest the ascending trendline from the 2021 bull market. The two indicators below the chart could foretell this scenario. The Stochastic RSI is currently curving downwards, indicating that upside momentum is starting to disappear. Also, the Relative Strength Index at the bottom of the chart is also posturing to the downside. In addition, this indicator is displaying bearish divergence. Both of these indicators could still begin to reverse back up, especially if strong buying is maintained for what is becoming an ever-decreasing supply of BTC. However, these indicators are key, so they will need to be watched very closely. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

37178625,https://thecoinrise.com/arthur-hayes-slams-eos-and-overhyped-ico-projects/,1733249492,Arthur Hayes Slams EOS And Overhyped ICO Projects,"Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX crypto exchange , has drawn attention recently due to his sharp critique of the 2017 EOS initial coin offering (ICO). In a blog post titled “The Cure,” Hayes called the ICO the “most value-destructive” offering of the year. Hayes delved into the post-launch stagnation of EOS. His criticism centers on the project’s controversial methods, particularly its centralized governance structure. He offered a cautionary tale about the perils of investing in projects that promise revolutionary technology but fail to deliver in the long run. EOS ICO: The ICO That Set a Record, But Fell Short When EOS launched its ICO in June 2017, it quickly became the largest token sale in crypto history, raising $4.1 billion in a year. The crypto community was excited, hoping it would solve scalability issues and improve decentralized governance. However, after launch, EOS struggled with technical glitches, governance problems, and a lack of innovation. By 2019, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Block.one for conducting an unregistered securities offering. This ultimately led to a $24 million settlement. EOS’s big promises were gradually revealed to be empty. The Risks of Overvalued Tokens: Hayes’ Cautionary Advice One of Hayes’ key messages is the danger of investing in high Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) and low float tokens. He warned that tokens listed on centralized exchanges, like EOS, can usually be overvalued, leading to significant losses for investors. According to Hayes, these tokens often appear promising at first but fail to live up to expectations, as was the case with EOS. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the risks associated with such tokens and advocates for more caution in the marketplace. Hayes drew attention to the stark contrast between EOS’s initial hype and its long-term stagnation. Despite these failures, EOS maintained a market cap of $1.2 billion. Hayes sees this as a reflection of the crypto market’s unpredictable and volatile nature. At its peak, EOS’s price reached $22.89 in April 2018, but it has since plunged by 95%, trading at just $1.15 today. Hayes Urges a New Vision for ICOs While Hayes is critical of the EOS ICO, he is not entirely dismissive of the ICO model. He calls for a return to ICOs that offer real opportunities for retail investors to participate in projects with long-term potential. Hayes advocates focusing on new projects that can prove their worth through innovation. He emphasizes the importance of delivering on promises to gain trust and support. He believes this is the key to reviving investor confidence and ensuring the success of future blockchain ventures.

Right now, analysts' Solana price predictions all point to a festive boom to the $800 mark - a historical performance that could be fueled by its record-breaking DEX volume uptick and the recent Firedancer Upgrade. But that's not all. A new crypto, Rollblock, is capturing attention with its GambleFi solution and Web3 gaming innovation. In fact, its presale had already garnered over $6.6M, and analysts predict it could increase 800% by the time it concludes. The holiday season is here. Can these high-potential duos dominate? Let's find out. Solana price prediction: Analysts predict $800 surge for SOL Despite the growing adversities, the Solana price clinched a new ATH from its post-FTX woes, and now the Solana price prediction has come out even better. The token did capture the market's imagination this year with an impressive 268% YTD gain. Analysts are even eyeing a bigger milestone of $800, a level that once felt overly ambitious but now seems so much like its natural progression. This optimism stems from Solana’s relentless innovation and an ecosystem thriving on cutting-edge technology. Central to its upward trajectory is the Firedancer upgrade, which brought a transformative leap aimed at turbocharging scalability and performance. And now, an uptick in on-chain metrics tells a more alluring tale. Solana DEX's record volume of $110B in November has outpaced Ethereum's. Institutional interest is also at an ATH, especially with Bitwise's recent filing. That's why savvy experts are gaining confidence from its over-100% post-FTX surge and Real Vision's Raoul Pal chipping in a near-term Solana price prediction of $800. Therefore, the $800 mark isn’t just a dream—it's looking so much like Solana’s next destination. iGaming on blockchain: New crypto Rollblock set for historical festive boom The highlight of this year's holiday has been the new DeFi and GambleFi contender, Rollblock. This innovative new crypto casino platform is set to redefine the fusion of decentralized finance (DeFi) and online gambling. With a clear focus on utility—Rollblock offers more than promises. This new crypto casino delivers a tangible bridge between blockchain and the multi-billion-dollar online gaming industry. Offering over 7,000 gaming options and an extensive sports betting platform, it caters to a broad audience. But the true allure lies beyond entertainment. Rollblock provides investors with unparalleled passive income opportunities, a feature that has driven its presale success and positioned it as a game-changer in both the DeFi and gaming spaces. At the heart of its investment appeal is its revenue-sharing model. Additionally, RBLK holders benefit from cashback rewards and staking opportunities, with potential returns as high as 30% APY. That spells out why analysts are weighing in with bold predictions of massive returns from its current presale stage—the price is just $0.037, and over $6.7M has been raised already. Conclusion The crypto market is alive with possibilities, and all eyes are on two standout contenders: Solanaand Rollblock. Solana's incredible resilience and innovation are setting the stage for a potential $800 price surge. Meanwhile, Rollblock is revolutionizing the GambleFi and Web3 gaming landscape with its unmatched utility and passive income opportunities, already raising over $6.7M in its presale.

37178671,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622188,1733249243,Trump picks pro-crypto Paul Atkins to chair SEC,"President-elect Donald Trump has reportedly picked pro-crypto Paul Atkins as the new chair for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), according to three sources familiar with the matter. This comes as the current chair Gary Gensler indicated he was stepping down from office effective January 20, when Trump will be inaugurated. Trump approached Paul Atkins who is yet to respond One of the sources revealed that President Trump approached Atkins on the matter. However, Atkins is reportedly reluctant to take up the job. If the selection is confirmed, the President-elect will have delivered on his election promise to the crypto community. The current chair has been deemed a pariah in the crypto industry as he made his tenure a time for policy regulation and enforcement. Atkinson can enter office in two ways either by being confirmed by the Senate or if the President-elect chooses to exercise the recession appointment option while Senate is out of session. However, CoinDesk reports that Atkins is reluctant to take the job and a lot of stars would need to align for him to accept the offer. The report said it is an unattractive role for Atkins because of the work needed to put the SEC back on track as he believes the incumbent chair has mismanaged the agency. The reluctance to clean up the mess has been said by former Commodity Futures Trading Commission chair Chris Giancarlo, who has tipped Atkins for the role he was once considered a candidate. Respected in the Republican party and conservative legal circles, Atkins served as SEC chair during President George W. Bush’s era and has been a crypto advocate since leaving office. *TRUMP PICKS PAUL ATKINS FOR SEC CHAIR, UNCHAINED CRYPTO REPORTS Source: DB — db (@tier10k) December 3, 2024 Paul Atkins has remained supportive of crypto industry He has become publicly supportive of the industry, having been a co-chair at the Token Alliance at the industry group Digital Chamber of Commerce since 2017. According to CoinDesk Atkins is said to be reluctant to leave his consultancy practice at his firm Patomak Global Partners. He would then be tasked with resigning from his business interests, which he may only do once his firm is well positioned to operate without him, according to sources. The SEC chair candidate has since 2009 been advising digital finance companies on regulatory compliance. George Mason University professor J.W Verret who earlier in November served on the SEC Advisory Committee said Atkins was a well-respected man by Senate Republicans. “The tradition of Commissioner Paul Atkins is really respected by Senate Republicans. He was the first time anyone had been a true libertarian and SEC commissioner, and that was a unique thing.” Mason. The news of Atkins being tapped for SEC chair did not come as a surprise after he was spotted at Mar-A-Lago resort this week. Calls were made two weeks ago to crypto industry leaders by the team vetting candidates for the chairperson position to hear their preferred names to head the regulatory board. The current nomination is seen as a direct demonstration of how the incumbent is unpopular within the industry. Gensler has faced criticism for not setting up clear guidelines and rules for the crypto industry. Under his stewardship, the SEC instead went for a number of enforcement actions against crypto companies and protocols, including exchanges, token issuers, and NFT creators for failing to register with the agency or disclose their work with what the SEC claimed were unregistered securities offerings. According to The Block , other SEC chair role contenders included Robinhood executive Dan Gallagher, partner at Willkie Farr & Gallgher Robert Stebbins, partner at BakerHostetler law firm, and former litigation counsel for the SEC Teresa Goody Guilden. Gallagher on November 22 however said that he did not want the role.

37178674,https://blockworks.co/news/safe-cross-chain-solution-ethereum-roadmap,1733249204,Safenet is Safe’s bid for an ‘onchain VisaNet’,"New cross-chain solutions are tackling persistent challenges presented by Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap. Safe’s Safenet, planned for release in 2025, aims to operate as a transaction processor network atop existing blockchains, offering execution guarantees for cross-chain transactions. Safenet’s design — announced today — introduces a set of capabilities targeting longstanding issues in DeFi, such as speed, security and liquidity fragmentation. It reimagines transaction processing by unbundling execution and settlement, akin to VisaNet’s architecture. At its core, Safenet aims to dramatically improve transaction efficiency, processing transactions in under one second thanks to an intents-based solver network . This level of performance would bring cross-chain operations closer to real-time usability, allowing users to move assets or execute transactions between different blockchains almost instantaneously. Read more from our opinion section: Want cheaper and safer interoperability? Drop traditional bridges Whether transferring tokens or interacting with dapps, delays in moving across chains have traditionally hindered such activity, leading to a siloed user experience. “Safenet addresses DeFi’s biggest challenges: fragmentation, latency and complexity,” Lukas Schor, co-founder of Safe, said . By leveraging Safenet Processors, users gain access to instant liquidity and secure, composable transactions that span onchain and offchain networks. The network is secured by user-defined policies and a decentralized validator network — staking the SAFE token — and the system is geared towards providing robust protection against risks like address poisoning and other vulnerabilities. Validators actively oversee processor activity, and can flag any malicious behavior. This oversight, combined with user-set transaction rules, creates a defense-in-depth security layer that reduces exposure to common threats. On the chain abstraction front, Safenet’s ability to unify balances across chains represents a major step forward in usability. Instead of requiring users to manage separate wallets or bridge assets manually, Safenet plans to present a single, consolidated view of their holdings. Current Safe wallets secure $112 billion in assets, 75% of which is on Ethereum. They already allow for switching between multiple networks, deploying the same Ethereum address across many chains, but Safenet extends the abstraction beyond EVM-based networks to incorporate non-EVM-compatible chains like Solana, according to the Safe team. Safe TVL over time | Source: Dune / Safe Safe expects to bridge the gap between onchain and off-chain ecosystems as well, for example by enabling users to interact with centralized exchanges and payment systems using the same unified asset balance. This flexibility simplifies asset management while expanding the ways users can engage with their holdings. DEX activity accounts for about 5% of the Total Volume Processed (TVP) on Ethereum mainnet by Safe accounts, according to Richard Meissner, co-founder of Safe. “The remaining volume is a mix of asset transfers, treasury management, DAO governance actions and complex DeFi operations like liquidity provisioning,” Meissner told Blockworks. He notes that what differentiates Safe’s wallet from other solutions is its focus on providing smart accounts . “By advancing smart accounts, we offer features not possible with traditional EOA accounts like multisig, private key recovery [and] automation,” Meissner said. Safe is betting that features like these will make it appealing for businesses to move more of their operations onchain. A key component of Safenet’s functionality is its integration with ERC-7579 , a standard that defines interfaces and behaviors for modular smart accounts to ensure interoperability across different implementations or “modules.” By adopting ERC-7579, Safenet can facilitate the unbundling of transaction execution and settlement, similar to how VisaNet operates in traditional finance. To do so, Safe, in collaboration with Rhinestone, developed the Safe7579 Adapter , which enables Safe accounts to comply with the ERC-7579 standard. Such standards are crucial for interoperability. For instance, modules such as spending limits, role-based account access and recovery can be incorporated into Safe accounts. Safenet is set for alpha release in Q1 2025, initially supporting cross-chain accounts and basic liquidity functions. By mid-2025, Safenet will introduce third-party processors and compatibility with the Safe Apps SDK, enabling new use cases such as off-exchange settlement and subscription services.

Market sentiment remains cautious following the U.S. government’s transfer of 10,000 BTC worth approximately $962.88 million from a Silk Road-seized wallet. While this development stirred some jitters, the spotlight has shifted to altcoins like XRP and Solana ( SOL ), which are steadily climbing toward significant milestones, positioning themselves as frontrunners in the race to reach a $200 billion market cap by 2025. With XRP leveraging its growing ecosystem and Solana capitalizing on its DeFi dominance and scalability, both cryptocurrencies are positioned to make significant strides in the evolving digital asset market. XRP XRP, currently priced at $2.59 with a market cap of approximately $146 billion, has cemented its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, trailing only Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ). With growing regulatory clarity, an expanding ecosystem, and rising institutional demand, XRP is on a clear trajectory to potentially reach a $200 billion market cap by 2025. This milestone would represent a price of approximately $3.55 at the current circulating supply, underpinned by strong fundamentals and favorable market dynamics. The growing regulatory clarity surrounding Ripple Labs serves as a critical catalyst for XRP’s future. Speculation that the SEC may drop its lawsuit against Ripple has eased long-standing uncertainties, bolstering investor confidence and opening doors for institutional participation. Additionally, Ripple’s ecosystem expansion is accelerating, with the anticipated launch of its RLUSD stablecoin, which is expected to enhance liquidity and boost XRP’s utility in cross-border payments and institutional settlements. XRP price and market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap The approval and potential launch of XRP-spot ETFs in the United States could further redefine the market for XRP. Notably, WisdomTree has filed an S-1 with the SEC for an XRP-spot ETF, marking a significant step in institutional interest. This move builds on the success of the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW), which attracted $217 million in net inflows since its January 2024 launch. Moreover, on-chain data reveals record-breaking whale activity, signaling robust confidence among high-net-worth investors in XRP’s long-term prospects. With these factors aligning, XRP is well-positioned to achieve its ambitious $200 billion market cap, solidifying its place as a leading cryptocurrency in the evolving digital asset landscape. Solana (SOL) Solana, currently valued at $105.62 billion with a price of $222.38 per token, is on track to potentially reach a $200 billion market cap by 2025, representing an additional $94.38 billion in growth. The biggest catalyst for Solana’s growth is the anticipated approval of spot Solana ETFs, with major players like VanEck, 21Shares, and Bitwise filing applications. With the resignation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler sparking hopes of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment, the chances of ETF approvals have never been stronger. Solana’s on-chain metrics further strengthen its case. It dominates the decentralized exchange ( DEX ) space with a 45% market share, processing over $6 billion in daily DEX trading volume. Solana price and market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap Additionally, its Total Value Locked (TVL) has surged to $8.74 billion, nearly doubling since mid-2024, according to DefiLlama. Moreover, Solana’s decentralized applications (DApps) have seen record activity, with 28.87 million unique active wallets interacting with the network in a single week, demonstrating unmatched user engagement in the blockchain space. Institutional confidence in Solana is also at an all-time high. In Q3 2024, Solana-native applications attracted $173 million in investments, a 54% increase quarter-over-quarter, according to Messari . High-profile partnerships, such as Franklin Templeton launching an SEC-compliant money market fund on Solana and Société Générale deploying a MiCA-compliant stablecoin, further highlight the network’s appeal to traditional financial institutions. These developments not only boost Solana’s credibility but also drive adoption on a global scale. As both XRP and Solana capitalize on regulatory breakthroughs, ecosystem expansions, and institutional adoption, their march toward $200 billion market caps appears increasingly feasible. XRP’s focus on liquidity and institutional settlements, combined with Solana’s DeFi dominance and scalable infrastructure, positions these assets as frontrunners in the cryptocurrency race for 2025. With strong fundamentals and strategic initiatives driving their momentum, XRP and Solana are poised to reshape the digital asset landscape, solidifying their roles as leaders in the blockchain ecosystem.

Santiment reports trader fatigue and quieter market sentiment after profit-taking. The absence of FOMO suggests these altcoins may continue their upward momentum. The cryptocurrency market is seeing impressive gains, particularly for altcoins XRP , Cardano (ADA), and Stellar (XLM). XRP is up 444%, and Cardano is up 280% over the past 30 days. XLM has seen an even more astonishing growth of 512%. But a new report from market intelligence firm Santiment says these rallies may not be over yet .

Santiment says retail traders are “fatigued” after profit-taking from the earlier rallies in late November. But these coins are still going up. With less noise in the market, many investors are not buying or selling, which shows a quieter, more cautious phase. Santiment says this could be a positive indicator for continued price growth.

Amid this, Cardano (ADA) along with other major cryptocurrencies has experienced a notable rally and has gained significant attention from crypto enthusiasts. Meanwhile, the altcoin has surged more than 272% in upside momentum in the past 30 days. $231 Million Outflow, A Bullish Sign? Despite significant upside momentum, on-chain metrics hint that ADA is likely to carry this rally in the coming days. According to the on-chain analytics firm CoinGlass , since November 23, 2024, ADA’s spot Inflow/Outflow data shows that exchanges have seen a significant $231 million outflow. Source: Coinglass The outflow is a term that defines the amount of assets moved out from the exchanges. In the context of cryptocurrency, outflows often lead to price rallies, reduce the likelihood of selling pressure, and attract investors and traders. Current Price Momentum Currently, ADA is trading near the $1.20 level and has experienced a modest price decline of 2% in the past 24 hours. However, during the Asian trading session, ADA reached a two-year high of $1.326. Additionally, during the same period, its trading volume surged by 8.5%, indicating a modest increase in trader participation amid ADA’s bullish outlook. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level Despite these developments, experts suggest that ADA is currently facing strong resistance near $1.25 and appears to be struggling to breach this level. Based on recent price action, if the altcoin breaks and closes a daily candle above the $1.30 level, it could see a significant 32% upside momentum in the coming days. Source: Trading View Historically, whenever the ADA price reaches or breaks a resistance level, it tends to consolidate before a notable upside rally occurs on the chart. Currently, increased whale interest and confidence in the token suggest potential signs of bullish momentum or a buying opportunity. Geopolitical Uncertainty However, today, December 3, 2024, sentiment appears to be shifting to the downside as South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared emergency martial law. This significant development has triggered a notable sell-off of assets in the past few hours.

Atkins, a former SEC commissioner and a prominent advocate for the cryptocurrency industry, is said to see the position as a daunting challenge, especially since he sees the agency as having been mismanaged under SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. Atkins reportedly sees cleaning up Gensler’s “mess” as a significant deterrent to taking on the job. Atkins’ hesitations appear to have been echoed by other regulatory figures, including former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Chris Giancarlo. A staunch advocate of pro-crypto policies and a supporter of Atkins’ candidacy, Giancarlo has also expressed concerns about the significant work needed to reform the SEC. Giancarlo himself was once considered a candidate for SEC chairman.

37178975,https://invezz.com/?p=2336984,1733248675,Hedera surges 90% in 48 hours amid Ripple’s RLUSD launch and HBAR spot ETF news,"Hedera (HBAR) has been on a dramatic upward trajectory, surging by an astonishing 90% in just two days. The rapid price rally follows a confluence of bullish catalysts, including market speculation about a potential partnership between Ripple and Hedera to develop a global settlement standard and the filing of the first-ever Hedera HBAR spot ETF by Canary Capital. Speculation on Ripple’s plan to expand RLUSD to Hedera One of the primary drivers behind HBAR’s recent surge is growing speculation around a potential collaboration between Ripple and Hedera. Ripple, known for its cross-border payment solutions, is reportedly planning to expand its RLUSD stablecoin to the revolutionary Hedera network privacy layer that was announced by HBAR inventor Dr Leemon Baird. By leveraging Hedera’s high-performance blockchain, Ripple aims to bolster the utility of its stablecoin, paving the way for more institutional adoption and expanding HBAR’s role in the crypto ecosystem. Investors see this potential partnership as a crucial move that could further legitimize Hedera’s standing in the blockchain industry. Hedera’s faster transaction speeds and lower costs make it a suitable platform for Ripple’s RLUSD expansion, providing mutual benefits that could push HBAR’s value upward. As the speculation intensifies, traders are increasingly bullish on Hedera’s long-term prospects, contributing to the recent surge in its price. Institutional interest and HBAR spot ETF filing In addition to Ripple’s plans, another major factor driving HBAR’s growth is the recent filing by Canary Capital for the first-ever Hedera HBAR spot ETF. The filing signals an important milestone in Hedera’s journey toward greater institutional adoption. With increasing interest from traditional investors, the spot ETF would provide a regulated way for them to gain direct exposure to HBAR. The spot ETF could open the floodgates for more capital to flow into Hedera, potentially propelling the price even further. Canary Capital’s HBAR ETF filing has already caught the attention of the crypto market, as the success of similar ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum has demonstrated the potential for spot funds to fuel price growth. If approved, the HBAR spot ETF could make the cryptocurrency more accessible to institutional investors, further legitimizing Hedera’s ecosystem and spurring further demand for the token. Technical indicators confirm Hedera’s bullish momentum Technical indicators have also been highly favourable for Hedera, adding to the overall optimism. HBAR recently formed a golden cross, where the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) crossed above the 200-day SMA, a traditional bullish signal. Source: TradingView The formation of the Golden Cross has sparked a wave of buying activity, with the token climbing six out of seven days since November 26 and reaching a high of $0.3922—the highest price since March 2022. With strong technical indicators and growing institutional interest, HBAR could be poised for continued growth, with some analysts forecasting a price target of $0.30 and potentially $0.45 if it maintains momentum. However, investors should watch for key support levels, with $0.15 identified as a potential zone for short-term pullbacks, especially seeing that the 14-day RSI has climbed into the overbought region.

37178273,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=311498,1733248608,"Namada Launches Mainnet, Introducing Shielded Cross-Chain Transactions","December 3, 2024 – Zug, Switzerland Namada , the shielded asset hub enabling shielded cross-chain transactions, has officially published its genesis block, marking the launch of its mainnet. Along with the commencement of staking and governance, this marks the start of the first phase of Namada’s five-stage decentralized mainnet rollout. This marks an important step forward, offering comprehensive data protection and selective disclosure across the multichain landscape. Introducing Namada Namada is designed to enable the protection of users’ personal data when using on-chain assets and engaging in cross-chain transactions. Its key innovation, the MASP (multi-asset shielded pool), can support the shielding of user data related to any asset, enabling shielded interactions across different blockchain networks. Namada enables selective disclosure, giving users the ability to share transaction data publicly and to specific parties. Additionally, Namada is introducing a unique shielding rewards system for users protecting their personal data. Christopher Goes, co-founder of Namada, said, “Namada’s mainnet is a major accomplishment for the many contributors and community members who have worked hard to take Namada from an early idea to a real, operational protocol. “Individual control of data and freedom of disclosure is necessary for a free society. We aren’t there yet, but the Namada mainnet is an important step in the right direction.” The launch is fully decentralized, with the Anoma Foundation supporting the Namada ecosystem by proposing the mainnet candidate software and genesis balances. However, the foundation abstains from running validators, ensuring that the Namada community retains full control over the platform’s launch and direction. Adrian Brink, co-founder of Namada, said, “Namada is an important missing link for the crypto space. Real adoption has been held back by the lack of user control over sensitive data. “The goal of Namada is to give both individual and institutional users, who may have been waiting on the sidelines, the same freedoms and protections they have off-chain.” Key features of Namada Namada introduces a suite of innovative features designed to protect user data while enabling seamless shielded cross-chain interactions. Shielding rewards – Namada’s MASP supports the shielding of data for various assets within a unified shielded set. Users collect shielded set rewards for shielding their assets and enhancing on-chain data protection for everyone. Shielded actions – Users can engage in cross-chain activity, such as DeFi, while keeping their personal data shielded. User data is protected even when interacting with transparent DApps (decentralized applications) and chains. On-chain governance – NAM token holders participate in governance by staking their tokens to vote on protocol upgrades and other decisions. This mechanism ensures that the community has a direct role in the evolution of the network. PFG (public goods funding) – A portion of the NAM inflation is dedicated to funding public goods, supporting projects that benefit the broader Namada ecosystem and beyond. CPoS (cubic proof-of-stake) – Namada’s unique staking mechanism incentivizes network security by adjusting staking rewards based on the network’s current staking ratio. Validators and delegators are rewarded for securing the network, with penalties for protocol violations designed to discourage collusion and enhance overall security. Community-driven genesis process This process will unfold in five stages, each driven by community decisions via on-chain governance. Discussions around the mainnet release candidate software, configurations, genesis block draft and tokenomics have taken place within the Namada community forum , ensuring a transparent, decentralized and collective approach to the launch. The Anoma Foundation proposed the initial set of genesis allocations, including a total supply of one billion NAM tokens with no lockups, distributed among community members, early contributors and future development initiatives. This decentralized approach ensures that the network’s launch and ongoing governance remain in the hands of its users. Namada is poised to support IBC-based assets initially, but can be upgraded in the future to support additional ecosystems, with the aim of becoming the data protection layer for the entire multichain ecosystem. About Namada Namada is the shielded asset hub rewarding users to protect the multichain. By leveraging advanced ZK (zero-knowledge) cryptography, Namada enables selective disclosure of personal data, offering unparalleled data protection across assets, applications and blockchain networks. It introduces shielded cross-chain interactions and shielding rewards for users who protect their data and strengthen its shielded set.

David Marcus says Libra, later renamed Diem, would have “solved global payments at scale.” The tech executive notes his team spent months briefing “key regulators” in the US and abroad prior to announcing the project in June 2019 alongside 28 other companies. “Two weeks later, I was called to testify in front of both the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee, which was the starting point of two years of nonstop work and changes to appease lawmakers and regulators. By spring of 2021 (yes they slow-played us at every step), we had addressed every last possible regulatory concern across financial crime, money laundering, consumer protection, reserve management, buffers, and so much more, and we were ready to launch. We had worked on a slow rollout of a limited pilot that some members of the Fed’s Board of Governors were supportive of. At last, Chair Jay Powell was ready to let us move forward in a limited way. The story, as I heard it, is that Jay Powell was told by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen at one of their biweekly meetings that allowing this project to move forward was ‘political suicide,’ and she would not have his back if he let it happen. I wasn’t in the room when this conversation happened, so take these words with a grain of salt, but effectively this was the moment Libra was killed.” Marcus claims the U.S. Federal Reserve then told banks participating in the Libra project that it wasn’t comfortable with their involvement. “There was no legal or regulatory angle left for the government or regulators to kill the project. It was 100% a political kill – one that was executed through intimidation of captive banking institutions.” The Diem Association shuttered in early 2022 and sold off its intellectual property and other assets to Silvergate Capital Corporation, a bank that itself shut down the following year. Marcus now serves as the chief executive of Lightspark, a startup that aims to build Bitcoin ( BTC )-based enterprise payment solutions.

But the challenge is choosing the right coins to invest in during altcoin season. Some do well, some do better, and some don’t do much at all. Pepe Coin is raising its hand for a massive gain, and SUI is headed for a place among the big boys, but laurels go to Rollblock , a new online casino that will last a lot longer than altcoin season – this is one for the future. Rollblock (RBLK): Online gambling gets a home on the blockchain Blockchain tech is relatively new, but it is becoming ubiquitous. Rollblock is now bringing blockchain transparency and security to the $500 billion online gambling market and doing it in the most lucrative way imaginable. Rollblock is in the lead right out of the starting gates because it's not the promises of what may be or what it will do – it’s a done deal. Rollblock’s online casino is live and operational, serving tens of thousands of users with hundreds of games and doing it all on the secure backbone of Ethereum. Now, Rollblock is building its liquidity pool with a presale offer and offering all RBLK token holders a weekly share of the revenue generated on the online casino. This token is in presale, which means that it is likely to skyrocket once it hits the open markets. However, with a lucrative token promising passive income, nobody would be willing to sell this exciting new token. Sui (SUI): New layer one breaks out in altcoin season Sui has had a fantastic 2024. Sui’s market cap is up 416% this year alone and is on the verge of breaking into the top 20. Sui’s not even been around for two years, and it is already among the large-cap tokens. There are many Layer1 solutions on the market, but none showed the growth that Sui did. If Suican become legit competition for the ailing Toncoin and the stagnating Tron, Sui may just be one to watch this altcoin season. Pepe Coin (PEPE): cementing meme coin’s place among the best Meme coins have a torrid reputation as pump-and-dump schemes or rug pulls. However, Pepe coin has cast doubts on the meme coin critics by entering the top 20 coins, becoming the third meme coin to enter the top 20 after Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Meme coins have a different value system from what TradFi principles and high school economics classes are used to. These are the tokens of the future, governed by community consensus. Pepe Coin’s extremely low price point (four zeros after the decimal point) and blistering clearance times make it the perfect microtransactions payment system. Ignore Pepe Coin at your peril this altcoin season.

37179897,https://cryptonews.com/?p=315767,1733248210,VeChain’s $VET Booms With $1.5 Billion in Volume – Which Crypto Will Be the Next to Take Off?,"Supply chain management blockchain VeChain ($VET) blasted up 25% in the last 24 hours and posted over $1.5 billion in trading volume despite a 2.7% overnight fall in crypto’s $3.6 trillion market. VeChain’s overnight surge capitalizes a month-long winning streak for the cryptocurrency, which could signal that it might be the next big crypto . At its current price of $0.06242, $VET has grown 58.5% over the last seven days. Furthermore its gains over the last fortnight mount to 91.4%, while its thirty-day price appreciation has skyrocketed 224.5%. Clearly, VeChain’s performance is anomalous to the rest of the market. While the original and biggest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin ($BTC) , has also been on a winning streak since the re-election in early November of pro-crypto US President Donald Trump, its gains are slight compared to VeChain. In the last fortnight, Bitcoin rose 2.9%, while its 30-day advance stands at 39.6%. With a market cap over $5 billion, VeChain is currently the largest cryptocurrency in the Internet of Things (IoT) sector. IoT refers to a network of hardware connected via the internet and blockchain technology in order to facilitate a new generation of real-world interconnectivity that could have profound impact on global supply chain management and data collection. $VET’s price rise comes amidst a major price rally across leading cryptocurrencies related to IoT . The sector grew a staggering 37% overnight and now posts a collective market cap of $12.2 billion. Will VeChain’s $VET Continue to Rally? As a fellow Internet of Things token, VeChain mirrors IOTA Network’s recent performance . We can see heavy price appreciation from the start of the month, leading to a vertical ascent on the graph as massive buy orders come in. Its current price is the highest the token has traded for since early 2022. Source: TradingView This in turn has meant $VET is now frequently in overbought territory, and means there is an imbalance, which indicates a correction is likely inbound. However, VeChain’s relative strength index stands at 54 and falling. So, right now, the market is pricing it well. Today, VeChain is 77.5% short of its former all-time high (ATH) of $0.281 (April 19, 2021) but a staggering 3,195% up from its former all-time low (ATL) of $0.001917 set on March 13, 2020. From IoT to Catslap: It’s AltSeason! The scorching performances of VeChain’s $VET and IOTA Network’s $IOTA comes amidst renewed interest in altcoins, a term which once referred to anything that isn’t Bitcoin, but nowadays the designation tends to informally exclude Ethereum and even other multi-billion cap coins like Solana and XRP . For the last week, investors have been snapping up a new viral meme coin that debuted on Uniswap . Within 24 hours it had blown up over 1,500% as investors bundled in, intrigued by the project’s mini game. To play, head over to Catslap’s official website and click (or tap) the screen in order to animate a gif of the viral slapping cat. The leaderboard logs each slap by country and distributes rewards to the nation at the top. As of last weekend, players can enable a ‘Slap to Earn’ function which will enable players to earn $SLAP rewards for their slaps. Procure Catslap via Uniswap or directly via the official website , where 1 SLAP is around $0.00662773. The website urges investors to “buy and stake $SLAP before major announcement!” along with a timer displaying just over five days left. All this has helped Catslap become one of the nineteen best new meme coins on the market right now.

37178155,https://crypto.news/?p=14315896,1733248194,MatterFi unveils ‘phishing-proof’ fintech infrastructure,"MatterFi has announced the launch of its enterprise-ready platform, providing a “phishing-proof” fintech infrastructure to the market. The solution goes live following a six-month beta phase, MatterFi stated in a Dec. 3 press release shared with crypto.news. According to the announcement, the aim is to enable secure digital finance for both humans and artificial intelligence. Key to the infrastructure is an AI-powered agent for the solution “send-to-name” that means users don’t need complex wallet addresses to transact. Integration with software wallets, hardware wallets and AI agents and leveraging chain-agnostic financial rails means users get multiple security layers when transacting. MatterFi provides the platform that helps users guard against attacks such as hacking, phishing and SIM swaps among other security risks. You might also like: Phishing scams exploit Japan’s digital currencies as fraud cases rise: report With end-to-end cryptographic proofs removing the need for user passwords and login details, humans and AI agents can transact securely with other parties. Its use is more like access available with global finance apps such as Revolut and PayPal. “Enterprise adoption of newer DeFi technologies is not what it should be because of perceived risks and vulnerabilities surrounding these technologies. Not only that, the complexity of these technologies and reliance on complicated addresses has stalled adoption,” MatterFi founder Michael “Mehow” Pospieszalski said. Notably, MatterFi says all transactions remain private, something critical in the crypto market that data shows recorded a 150% spike in web3 phishing attacks in 2024. In October, blockchain security platform Certik reported that phishing attacks and private key leaks had seen users across the ecosystem lose $668 million in Q3, 2024. Data shows 80% of those that suffer phishing attacks lose money. In May 2024, MatterFi and neobank EQIFi announced a collaboration that aimed to bolster crypto security. The platforms targeted MatterFi’s technology to help address rising issues around crypto theft, fraud and money laundering. EQIFi and MatterFi revealed the partnership would leverage the “send-to-name” feature via a peer-to-peer platform to bring this benefit to users.

37178261,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622147,1733247939,Will Coinbase continue its meme token streak: Mog Coin (MOG) added to upcoming listing roadmap,"Coinbase has added Mog Coin (MOG) to its asset roadmap. The announcement comes just a day after the platform listed its first Pump.fun token, Moodeng (MOODENG). Coinbase added MOG to its roadmap for upcoming listings. There is no hard and fast rule for the actual listing, as in the case of Moodeng (MOODENG), which launched its first market just hours after being added to the roadmap. The official Mog Coin account corroborated the news, adding to the token’s exposure. COINBASE MOGS 🫵😹 https://t.co/D1aX2554TV pic.twitter.com/15AH0IpQB1 — MOG COIN (@MogCoinEth) December 3, 2024 MOG has been a staple in meme space, with regular roll-over from other memes and the potential to join blue chip memes and change its entire trading profile. MOG is just outside the list of top tokens with valuations over $1B, and has been trading flat for weeks. The potential Coinbase listing can revive this meme asset. The listing of MOODENG came as a surprise since Coinbase apparently limited itself to established tokens, not ones originating from Pump.fun. Additional speculations are also pointing to Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) as a potential upcoming addition to Coinbase. For now, PNUT is not on the roadmap, and a listing is assumed to be based on social media rumors. While new listings are constantly flowing into the meme token market, the main price drivers remain top blue-chip assets. They are valued higher, and price swings affect the market. MOG has the chance of joining that list, extending its appeal to general Internet users, without pressure to support a token-based cult. Coinbase to list Base version of Mog Coin Coinbase will list the asset’s Base version, tapping the L2 potential for much lower fees. In the case of a spot listing, this will be the asset to be deposited and traded officially. MOG already has 130,470 users, in the usual range for well-established memes. Mog Coin started as a friendly joke in the summer of 2023 and was launched as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-20 version is also active, with 43,716 holders. The asset resembles older memes with an engaging, but not fanatic online community. The big advantage of Mog Coin is its long-term presence and more stabilized liquidity. Both the Ethereum and the Base version of MOG pumped by around 20%, as there is no new inflow of liquidity. The token still relies on decentralized pairs, on Uniswap and Aerodrome. Both versions rallied to $0.0000024, retaining their usual low range. A listing on a major exchange and more exposure could achieve an even bigger rally, as it happened with MOODENG and earlier, PEPE. The recent decision to expand meme listings led influencer Murad Mahmudov to once again proclaim the meme super cycle is far from over, with more liquid listings coming. Big buyers come to MOG One of the signs of more potential liquidity for MOG was the growth of Wintermute 3 holdings. The market maker started accumulating from October onward, ending up with 5.5T MOG. Wintermute now holds around 1.14% of the MOG supply on Ethereum, entering the top 10 wallets. An addition to Wintermute has been correlated with new listings, though it is not a guarantee. Crypto.com has also accrued MOG after a competitive campaign for token deposits. Even before the listing, addresses related to Coinbase were also accumulating MOG in the ERC-20 version. The address holds 312B MOG, a relatively small amount, potentially fit for experiments. In addition to transparent holdings, data from Bubblemaps shows small-scale connected clusters of wallets for the Base version of MOG. For now, the supply is not sniped or posing risk of dumping on the community. Wallet clusters have already formed, though holding a smaller fraction of the MOG supply. | Source: Bubblemaps MOG remains moderately decentralized , with top wallets holding a smaller proportion of the token’s supply. Those conditions can change without a warning, in case whales and market makers move in, skewing the balance. Wallet clusters may also affect MOG in the short term. MOG has been more active since its Binance perpetual futures listing. As the token gains popularity for being the ‘first internet culture coin’, a retail listing may also boost spot volumes and lead to aggressive price expansion in the short term. MOG remains risky and has gone through 70% drawdowns, in addition to active rallies and jumps to a new price range.

37179406,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51263,1733247922,"BTFD Completes 25% Presale Journey on Day One While Dogecoin Faces a Ruff Patch, and NEIRO Gains Momentum","Meme coins have captured the hearts (and wallets) of crypto enthusiasts for years. They started as jokes, sure, but now they’re serious contenders in the world of digital assets. From Dogecoin’s quirky Shiba Inu mascot to the rise of innovative meme tokens like NEIRO, the buzz around these coins keeps getting louder. But this month? The spotlight is firmly on BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a new player that’s flipping the script with its blistering presale success and ambitious roadmap. BTFD Coin has already shaken up the game. Launching its presale on November 26, 2024, BTFD managed to hit its sixth stage in under 24 hours. That’s right—a whopping 25% of its 16-stage presale journey was wrapped up in just one day! Crypto insiders are buzzing about its P2E game, juicy staking rewards, and the sheer power of its growing community. The question on everyone’s lips? Is BTFD the best crypto coin to invest in right now? In this article, we’ll break down what makes BTFD Coin, NEIRO, and Dogecoin stand out in December 2024. Each has its own story, its own hype, and its own appeal—but only one might just be the golden ticket to your next big crypto win. BTFD Coin: The Bullish New Kid on the Block If there’s one thing the crypto world loves, it’s a good presale story, and BTFD Coin has one for the books. With a starting price of just $0.000004, BTFD took off like a rocket. Within the first 24 hours, over 10 billion coins were sold , raising more than $700,000 . Fast forward to the sixth stage of the presale, and the coin is now priced at $0.000058 , with over 18 billion coins sold and 1,700 holders proudly calling themselves “Bulls.” But why the hype? Let’s talk features. BTFD isn’t just another meme coin riding on internet culture. It’s a multi-faceted project that combines a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game and staking rewards with community-driven utility. In fact, analysts predict BTFD’s presale could end with a price tag of $0.0006 , delivering jaw-dropping returns for early investors. Let’s do the math. If you invested $4,000 in Stage 6 at $0.000058 per coin, you’d bag approximately 68,965,517 BTFD coins . When the price hits $0.0006 post-presale, your investment would balloon to $41,379.31 . That’s over 900% growth in just a few months! No wonder BTFD is being hailed as the best crypto coin to invest in right now. But it’s not just the numbers causing a stir. BTFD’s community has gone full throttle, with social media campaigns and FOMO-inducing chatter. As the presale moves into its later stages, one thing’s clear: BTFD isn’t just here to play—it’s here to dominate. NEIRO: Rising Star with Bullish Momentum While BTFD might be stealing headlines, NEIRO is quietly building its own empire. Trading against USDT, NEIRO has been on a bullish tear. After breaking through its key resistance at $0.0080 , the token now eyes the $0.0095–$0.0100 zone , with analysts predicting a run toward $0.0110 if the momentum holds. What sets NEIRO apart? For starters, its trend structure screams bullish. The price recently broke out of a consolidation range, and its Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows a strong upward crossover. Coupled with increasing volume and a Relative Strength Index (RSI) nearing 60, NEIRO’s short-term outlook looks promising. But NEIRO isn’t just about technicals. Its community is growing fast, thanks to its focus on usability and real-world adoption. While it doesn’t boast flashy features like P2E games or staking, NEIRO’s stability and clear upward trajectory make it a strong contender for those looking to diversify their portfolio. Is it the best crypto coin to invest in? For risk-averse investors, it might just be. The big question is whether NEIRO can sustain its momentum as it approaches key resistance levels. If it breaks above $0.0095 , expect fireworks. If not? Well, the $0.0080 support level will be one to watch closely. Dogecoin: The OG Meme Coin Faces New Challenges Ah, Dogecoin. The coin that started it all. From its humble beginnings as a joke to becoming the face of the meme coin revolution, DOGE has seen it all. But in December 2024, things are looking… complicated. While Dogecoin remains a household name, controversies have recently dogged its reputation (pun fully intended). After spiking to $0.0016 back in August, DOGE has tumbled by over 54.6% , with further declines seen in recent weeks. Critics point to a lack of innovation and over-reliance on its status as “Elon Musk’s favourite coin.” Meanwhile, newer entrants like BTFD and NEIRO are stealing the show with unique utilities and fresher narratives. That said, Dogecoin’s loyal fanbase shouldn’t be underestimated. Its massive community, coupled with brand recognition, keeps it afloat even during bearish cycles. For many, DOGE is more than an investment; it’s a cultural phenomenon. But does that make it the best crypto coin to invest in right now? Not quite. Without significant developments or use-case expansions, Dogecoin risks becoming the Myspace of meme coins. The verdict? Dogecoin’s OG status will always make it a safe bet for newcomers dabbling in crypto. But for those chasing high returns or groundbreaking features, the new kids on the block—like BTFD Coin—are where the action’s at. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, the meme coin space is evolving faster than ever. While Dogecoin remains a cultural icon, its lack of innovation leaves room for fresh projects like BTFD Coin and NEIRO to shine. BTFD Coin stands out as the best crypto coin to invest in this month, thanks to its explosive presale performance, exciting features like P2E gaming, and a dedicated community. Meanwhile, NEIRO offers a solid, bullish alternative for investors looking for stability and growth. With BTFD’s presale moving into Stage 6 and prices still accessible, the window to maximise returns is narrowing. Don’t miss your shot at what could be 2024’s breakout crypto project. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and ride the wave to the top!

42388852,1c9a8b32-da94-447f-8444-8576aa53826f,1733247563,Trump's Top SEC Chair Pick Paul Atkins Reluctant to Take Job: Source,"A lot of stars would need to align for Paul Atkins, reportedly President-elect Donald Trump’s top candidate to chair the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, to take the job.    It is an unattractive role for him because of the amount of work needed to turn around the bloated agency he believes was mismanaged by outgoing SEC chair Gary Gensler, a person familiar with Atkins' thinking said.    Read more: Trump Names Former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins as His Pick for Chair of the Agency    Reluctance to clean up Gensler's “mess” has been shared by former Commodity Futures Trading Commission chair Chris Giancarlo, who has advocated for Atkins to take the SEC job and was once considered a candidate himself.    Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, was spotted at Trump's Mar-A-Lago resort this week, one industry source said. He was scheduled to interview for the SEC chair role Sunday and Monday, said another person with knowledge of the meetings.    Atkins is the founder and CEO of Patomak Global Partners, a global consulting firm specializing in strategy, risk management, and regulatory compliance. Patomak serves crypto firms, but they are a small part of its diversified practice, which includes traditional financial clients, public companies, trade associations, law firms, banks and insurance companies. Prior to starting Patomak, Atkins was a commissioner of the SEC from 2002 to 2008, appointed by former President George W. Bush. During his time at the SEC, Mark Uyeda and Hester Peirce, who later became commissioners, worked as counsel to Atkins.    Atkins is well regarded in conservative circles. According to a source close to Atkins, he is friendly with Key Square Group founder Scott Bessent, the billionaire hedge fund manager selected by Trump to become Treasury Secretary.    Atkins is reluctant to leave his practice, the person familiar with his thinking said. Taking up the SEC chair role would require him to resign from his business interests, which he may only do once his firm is well-positioned to operate without him, sources said.    Other candidates    Crypto attorney Teresa Goody Guillén is also said to be under consideration by the Trump transition team. Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, Cardano creator Charles Hoskinson and other crypto executives are privately and publicly supporting her based on her pro-crypto views and experience serving and arguing against the SEC on behalf of blockchain clients. Guillén has declared on X that she wants to “Make Crypto Great Again” and has been polling the public on the most effective ways the agency could address regulatory challenges.    Last week, crypto executive and former acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks was believed to be a lead candidate to helm the SEC, gathering strong support from Web3 proponents and at one point leading the odds on prediction market Kalshi. But his lack of securities law experience made him a longshot, sources said.    Circle Chief Legal Officer and Head of Corporate Affairs Heath Tarbert is reportedly being considered. He is a former CFTC chair, assistant Treasury secretary, and associate White House counsel. ""We won't comment on speculation,” said a Circle spokesperson.    Brad Bondi was floated as a possible candidate, and while he has been described as “pro-crypto,” critics privately said he has little experience in Web3, and is more of a traditional securities lawyer with a background serving the SEC and opposing the agency in court. But Bondi’s trump card, as it were, could be his close ties to the Trump administration. His sister Pam Bondi was nominated to become U.S. attorney general and is a Trump loyalist who represented the former president during his 2020 impeachment trial.    Similarly, former SEC investment management director and Kirkland and Ellis partner Norm Champ is a Trump campaign backer who told CoinDesk “I would be honored to serve as SEC Chair if President Trump thinks I am the right person for the job.” But his traditional securities background has not gathered excitement in the crypto community.    Trump’s pick for Manhattan’s U.S. attorney, Jay Clayton, has strongly endorsed attorneys Robert Stebbins and Dalia Blass, sources said, whom he supervised as SEC chief from 2017 to 2020. Crypto experts have been outspoken against them.    “Stebbins personally signed off, approved and encouraged 80 or so SEC crypto-related enforcement actions, including the most controversial of all – the SEC case involving Ripple,” wrote Ripple Labs advocate and former SEC attorney John Reed Stark on X. The SEC partially lost that case when a judge ruled that XRP sales by Ripple Labs on public exchanges did not fall under the definition of a security; the agency has said it will appeal that decision.    “Big Crypto is extraordinarily powerful and will have a lot of influence in the SEC Chair’s selection and I can’t imagine Big Crypto allowing Bob Stebbins to get the SEC Chair nomination,” Stark wrote.    Republican SEC commissioner Uyeda could become acting chair of the SEC after Gary Gensler steps down on inauguration day if the Senate doesn't confirm his SEC pick by January 20. Commissioner Peirce, another favorite for the role, has privately stated she is not interested in being the chair on an acting or permanent basis, which would improve Uyeda’s chances. Whether he would stay in the role is less certain.    “I expect Trump may prefer to bring in someone new of his own,"" crypto lawyer Jake Chervinsky stated on X.    Robinhood chief legal officer Dan Gallagher was said to be a top SEC chief candidate before the election, but he has since said he is not interested.    “I have made it clear that I do not wish to be considered for this position.” Gallagher told CoinDesk in an emailed statement. “I feel I can make tremendous progress to democratize finance in my current role, and I will remain a vocal and consistent advocate for positive change in our markets.""    Atkins, Guillén, and Uyeda declined to comment for this story. Trump transition team spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, Brooks, Brad Bondi, Stebbins, and Blass did not respond to requests for comment.    Washington experts say the Trump administration will likely roll back the SEC’s oversight of the $3 trillion digital assets market in favor of the CFTC. The latter agency is widely perceived to take a lighter touch because the market it regulates – derivatives – is dominated by sophisticated institutional traders rather than retail investors with less risk tolerance.  The SEC has led a wide-ranging campaign against digital assets companies that was often criticized as unfair. The five-member commission will additionally need to fill a commissioner position following Jamie Lizárraga’s announced departure. The crypto community is keeping a close eye on the SEC chair selection process, which is expected to conclude in the coming days.",NEUTRAL,없음,ADA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Christine Lee,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/12/03/trumps-top-sec-chair-pick-paul-atkins-reluctant-to-take-job-source,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7a91fc4f69e67febb0ab81c532a75324d6e0685f-3000x2077.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

37177756,https://coinpedia.org/?p=388844,1733247312,"XRP Pumps 13%, Has 1.5X Volume of Bitcoin on Coinbase – Crypto Whales Also Buying Crypto All-Stars","The post XRP Pumps 13%, Has 1.5X Volume of Bitcoin on Coinbase – Crypto Whales Also Buying Crypto All-Stars appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP continues to show strength, pumping by 13% in the past 24 hours to $2.73. Capital is flooding in, with XRP generating over 150% higher trading volume than Bitcoin on Coinbase. Meanwhile, ICO token Crypto All-Stars is also seeing huge demand as its raise nears $8 million. WisdomTree XRP Spot ETF Triggers Pump Ripple’s XRP has seen its price rocket since Donald Trump won the US presidential election in November. It’s now trading at a 440% monthly premium and has added $100 billion to its market cap in one month. As such, XRP is trading higher than its 2021 bull market peak and just 29% from its 2018 all-time high (ATH). Today’s XRP rally was spurred by Wall Street money manager WisdomTree filing for an XRP spot ETF. They’re joining the race alongside Bitwise and Canary Capital. The ETF aims to give investors price exposure to XRP via shares tradable on the Cboe BZX Exchange. XRP’s Volume Surpasses Bitcoin’s On Coinbase Trading volume is a key measure of where the market’s attention lies, and right now, it shows that all eyes are on XRP. Coinbase is the second-most active centralized exchange by trading volume and the most popular in the United States. And right now, trading volume for XRP is 1.5 times higher than it is for Bitcoin. In the past 24 hours, $2.3 billion worth of XRP has changed hands on the exchange, accounting for 21.39% of its entire volume. Bitcoin takes second place with $1.5 billion, accounting for 14.65% of Coinbase’s volume. Notably, demand for XRP on Coinbase is creating a significant price premium on the platform. Coinbase whales are driving this $XRP rally. Over the past 30 days, Coinbase's minute-level price premium has ranged from 3% to 13% during the surge. Meanwhile, Upbit—a Korean exchange with more XRP investors than Binance—has shown no significant premium so far. pic.twitter.com/ENESB2Zrkv — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) December 2, 2024 It’s a similar story to Binance. XRP is leading the way with $5.5 billion in volume and a 10% market share. XRP’s explosive rally this month has instilled more confidence in crypto traders. By adding $100 billion to its market cap in one month, XRP has set the tone for how parabolic the crypto bull run could get. With that, traders are positioning in tokens that they think could pump next. Hedera and Kaia are top performers among large caps, each rising 39% today. Meanwhile, a new market emergent, Crypto All-Stars, is also drawing attention as its presale raise surges toward $8 million. Analyst Backs New Altcoin Crypto All-Stars to 100X After IEO Crypto All-Stars is an innovative project that creates utility inside the meme coin sector. It’s building a meme coin staking layer that lets users deposit their DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and more to earn passive rewards. Typically, the only utility of meme coins is “buy low, sell high.” Despite that, the sector has a market cap of $130 billion. Crypto All-Stars hopes to lift that by creating a tangible way for holders to use their meme coins. Users lock their tokens up in Crypto All-Stars’ “MemeVault,” and they’ll generate passive rewards over time. However, the caveat is that they must hold $STARS tokens, and their rewards depend on how much they have. https://twitter.com/all_stars_coin/status/1860745219719020763 This creates a dynamic where holders of all the top meme coins will be vying to accumulate the same token, which analysts think is a juncture with massive potential. For instance, the Crypto June recently said it can 100x. The analyst noted that the presale will end in 20 days, meaning prospective buyers should act quickly to avoid missing out. With the crypto market taking off this month, it’s no surprise that traders anticipate such significant gains for a new innovative project like $STARS.

Although its bullish momentum is losing steam, crypto analyst Alan Santana has shared a bold Ethereum price prediction, suggesting it could hit the $15k level by the end of 2025. On the other hand, the BNB price has extended its rally but appears to be limited above the $685 level. Meanwhile, Lunex Network continues to hit impressive presale milestones. Within a few days of hitting the $0.0033 milestone, Lunex’s holders anticipate another price increase to $0,0038. This would mark over 210% ROI for early adopters who bought the token at its starting price of $0.0012. Analysts believe the $1 mark is on the cards for this new deflationary titan in 2025. Lunex Holders Anticipate Another Price Increase To $0.0038 Low fees, advanced liquidity, and revenue share model have attracted savvy investors to the Lunex Network (LNEX) presale. The project has introduced an aggregation protocol that sources liquidity from multiple exchanges and even splits a single trade through several exchanges to ensure the best possible prices. Its smart contract verifies transactions to ensure that each trade is accurate. With this smart contract approach and real-time information aggregation, Lunex offers trading that is not only secure but highly efficient. For advanced users, Lunex Pro will provide premium services with unique tools, including custom trading approaches, faster execution speeds, and live market data. These unique features are perfect for high-volume traders who need precise tools to execute strategies and manage their portfolios effectively. What’s more interesting is its revenue share model that offers real passive income. Lunex will use a portion of its revenue from subscription and trading to buy LNEX tokens from the open market. These repurchased tokens will then be redistributed to those who staked LNEX. The project has already raised over $3.8 million in presale. Meanwhile, Lunex is preparing to enter the DeFi market, expected to explode to USD 213.19 billion by 2030 . Grabbing even the smallest share of this market share could increase LNEX's valuation exponentially to close in on the $1 mark. Ethereum Price Could Hit $15K In 2025 Crypto analyst Alan Santana has been making headlines, predicting a significant upswing for Ethereum in 2025. Santana notes that while the top altcoin has been lagging compared to Bitcoin’s price performance, the ETH token is on track for a massive price movement. He also predicted a potential rise in Ethereum’s value to around the $15K level during the 2024-2025 bull cycle, repeating similar gains similar to or slightly less than the previous cycle. Santana’s prediction is based on growing institutional adoption, such as the recent Hong Kong Bank launch that will enable its users to trade ETH tokens. Crypto YouTuber Lark Davis had also previously predicted a move to the $15K mark. His forecast was based on a hypothetical 200% increase from ETH’s previous high of approximately $4,880 in November 2021. This would mean a 500-600% gain for buyers who purchased ETH coins below the $2000 mark. According to him, this is a relatively low-risk bet in the crypto world. Ethereum’s technical structure aligns with this bullish sentiment. The token has seen an uptick in open interest, surging from 6.32 million ETH to over $27 billion, marking a 17% month-to-date gain. ETH price also validates an uptrend after surging by 35% to $3.4K in the past month. BNB Regains The $625 Support Level BNB’s price has grown remarkably in the past month. However, the token is paring off some gains after failing to hold support near the $650 level . Its price is now hovering below its 100-hourly simple moving average. The bulls have regained the $625 support, and if they manage to hold this level, the BNB token could witness fresh rallies. The on-chain technical indicator aligns with a bullish sentiment. Its relative strength index is above the neutral level, at 50, and is currently increasing. Moreover, BNB’s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence has decreased in the bearish zone. Notably, if the bulls fail to hold the $625 support level, the next target would be the $615 level. Notably, if the bulls fail to hold this significant support level, the price of BNB coin could continue its downtrend toward the $600 support. Any additional losses could push BNB's value downwards, initiating a more significant decline toward the $588 level. Best Token To Buy While Ethereum and BNB coins are great prospects for long-term gains, the Lunex presale presents intriguing opportunities for short-term gains. Savvy investors are flocking to the presale to capitalize on this opportunity before the price soars.

A source said Trump has reached out to Atkins but is still waiting for her to accept. Paul Atkins was an advisor to the RSR token, RSR rose by 20% following the news. Trump’s decision to nominate Atkins is in line with his campaign promises to support the crypto industry. While Atkins has yet to officially accept the position, her selection is seen as a direct response to widespread dissatisfaction with the tenure of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. Gensler, who announced his resignation effective January 20, had faced heavy criticism for his sanctions-focused approach to regulating the crypto industry. During his tenure at the SEC, Gensler has taken numerous enforcement actions against exchanges, token issuers and other crypto assets, often citing violations of securities laws. His critics have argued that he has failed to provide clear regulatory guidelines and fostered uncertainty across the industry. Paul Atkins is a well-known figure in financial and regulatory circles. He served as SEC commissioner under President George W. Bush and is widely respected in conservative and establishment Republican circles. Since leaving the SEC, Atkins has emerged as a strong supporter of the crypto industry and has served as co-chair of the Token Alliance at the Chamber of Digital Commerce since 2017. *This is not investment advice.

Indeed, the move has sparked massive excitement, and Moo Deng is preparing for another explosive run after it initially took the market by storm in September. MOODENG Leads Meme Coin Rally CoinGecko data shows that Moo Deng’s price has surged by 87% in the past 24 hours, bringing its market cap to $612 million. This makes it the best-performing meme coin today and caused it to flip BOME’s market cap. Coinbase made the announcement on its Coinbase Assets X page, noting that Moo Deng has been added to the roadmap. It has yet to launch for trading, but previous meme coins listed on the roadmap have typically gone live the same day.

And with the Coinbase listing yet to go live, we could potentially see another uptick in momentum in the coming days. Moo Deng’s resurgence this week underscores the market-moving importance of centralized exchange listings, and this is also partly why Catslap has rocketed 66% in the past 24 hours. Is Catslap the Next Moo Deng? CEX Listing Announcement in 2 Days Catslap is a viral meme coin that has shot up 66% to a $, buoyed by anticipation for an upcoming exchange listing alongside a significant institutional money investment. The token launched on 23 November and got off to a fast start. But after retracing with the broader market, it’s back on the rise again. Investors are awaiting a “major announcement” in two days that will reveal a centralized exchange that Catslap will list on.

Catslap recently caused a buzz by unveiling its “Slap-to-Earn” gamified experience, where users choose a character they want to slap, and then get to work and earn $SLAP tokens. With that, analysts have high hopes. Crypto June even says it could make millionaires. The project also has a staking mechanism encouraging users to lock up their tokens long-term. Another feature is its burn mechanism, which will decrease the circulating supply over time, making the remaining $SLAP tokens more valuable. This is more than just an average meme coin. It has all the hallmarks of a project that could rival Moo Deng and beyond.

37179896,https://cryptonews.com/?p=315717,1733246885,MARA Acquires Texas Wind Farm to Reduce Grid Dependency,"Bitcoin miner MARA has acquired a 114-megawatt wind farm in North Texas to power its mining operations. According to a recent filing with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , the wind farm, located in Hansford County, will operate intermittently, mining Bitcoin only when wind power is available. MARA to Eliminate Dependence on Grid MARA Holdings acquired the wind farm from a joint venture between National Grid Plc and the Washington State Investment Board, according to the filing. The financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. 114 MW of operational wind generation 240 MW of interconnection capacity Zero-marginal energy costs MARA has acquired a wind farm in Hansford County, TX, to sustainably mine #bitcoin . This milestone allows us to extend the life of legacy miners while balancing the local grid. pic.twitter.com/YiBpfwwYSk — MARA (@MARAHoldings) December 3, 2024 The facility’s 114-megawatt capacity will be utilized exclusively for Bitcoin mining when wind power is available, with operations paused during periods of low wind generation. This model minimizes dependency on the electrical grid and uses renewable energy. Fred Thiel, MARA’s Chairman and CEO, stated that the wind farm would likely operate about 30% of the time, aligning with wind availability. The mining operation will use older-generation equipment that would otherwise have been retired. “We can move the market to where the electrons are, as opposed to moving the electrons to where the market is,” said Thiel in an interview . “We eliminate the dependence on the grid.” The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, with MARA considering additional investments in renewable energy facilities in the future. Energy Competition with AI Data Centers MARA’s decision came amid growing competition for energy resources, as artificial intelligence operations increasingly demand substantial electricity supplies, leaving Bitcoin miners to seek alternative energy sources like wind and solar. “Bitcoin miners are being forced to go look at marginal generation,” stated Thiel. “The AI guys can afford to pay a much higher amount for energy than a Bitcoin miner.” Thiel also suggested that the company could continue to explore future acquisitions of wind energy assets.

Santa Pepe (SANPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Pepe by entering its contract address – 2NefXDdBhUkVn7dXW5wxVtCHKHKE8uiRGUqZGxT5HAN8 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/santa-pepe-sanpepe-solana-memecoin-to-rally-19000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-as-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The political earthquake in Washington is sending crypto assets to their all-time highs. Among the various market segments, meme coins are among the biggest gainers. One token is expected to replicate the returns Doge did and it’s not Pepe. A new altcoin, Cutoshi , is gaining traction in the market. Dogecoin Sees Renewed Interest Among all the memecoins, Dogecoin (DOGE) is the most legendary. After a spectacular growth in 2021, Dogecoin is once again attracting interest and delivering returns. Notably, the original meme coin saw an increase of 161.04% in the last 30 days. Source: CMC The catalyst for Doge’s latest growth is the monumental political change in the US. With Trump’s victory, Dogecoin’s main promoter, Elon Musk, will soon have an influential position in Washington. Musk did not hesitate to use his position to pump Doge, naming its Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) after the token. Still, Dogecoin hasn’t reached the heights of its 2021 bull run and it’s still 43.06% below its all-time high. While its moving averages indicate a strong buy, Doge will face significant resistance near the psychological level of $0.5. Pepe Sees Major Potential Pepe was one of the strong performers this cycle, thanks to the bull market. Notably, the token was up 131.57% in the last 30 days, currently trading at $0.00002016. The reason for this strong performance was Pepe’s listing on major exchanges. Source: CMC In November, Pepe won a listing on both Coinbase and Robinhood. This gave millions of tradersaccess to the token, pushing trader sentiment up. This has also catalyzed whale accumulation, as large traders bought 10 trillion Pepe tokens after the listing. The bullish momentum for Pepe continues. Currently, the token is trading above most moving averages , indicating that there’s significant upside potential for the token. Still, the oscillators are mostly neutral and Pepe’s large market cap will weigh on its performance in the future. Can Cutoshi Replicate Doge’s Growth? While Pepe has had a strong run this cycle, it will not be the token that can give Doge-like returns. Instead, another token, Cutoshi (CUTO), seems a more likely candidate. This token combines memecoins with DeFi, appealing to a broad base of investors. On November 22, this new token raised $1 million in its presale. This sentiment is expected to continue, thanks to growing interest in meme coins and DeFi. Cutoshi is a meme token, with a Chinese Lucky Cat as its mascot, that focuses on utility. By blending memecoins and DeFi, its goal is to make DeFi more accessible to traders and users. The project is also hosting a meme competition, rewarding aspiring artists with $2,000 for their submissions. For those who wish to learn more, can do so here! While DeFi has strong benefits compared to CEX’s it is still inaccessible to most traders. This is why many opt to give custody over their assets to shady entities, sometimes with disastrous results. Cutoshi wants to fix this by creating a multichain DEX that’s accessible to all. This goal and its clever use of memes, indicates that it may be a token that can capture attention like Doge did in the past.

37177477,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373251,1733246566,This Metric Suggests BTC Could See Sharp Uptick Within the Next 2 Months,"Bitcoin (BTC) currently ranges between $94,000 and $96,000, but on-chain signals suggest the cryptocurrency is on the verge of a massive breakout. Data from blockchain analytics platform CryptoQuant indicates that BTC could witness a sharp and significant uptick within the next one to two months. According to a report by pseudonymous digital asset analyst Crypto Dan, a signal usually seen once or twice in each bull market has just appeared. It indicates that BTC could skyrocket soon as it approaches the final phase of this cycle. BTC Could Skyrocket in 2 Months The signal called the golden cross of the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) indicator entails the SOPR 365-day moving average crossing the SOPR 30-day moving average. Only in bull seasons have these indicators crossed, and the market has experienced a strong rally within the following two months each time. Crypto Dan said the signal occurs once or twice throughout an entire bull cycle, and it is the second in this upward phase that kicked off in January 2023. Notably, the upcoming rally is likely to be the largest in the final phase of this cycle. The crypto analyst mentioned that the magnitude of these runs often increases as the market advances toward the later stages of the bull cycle, while declines and corrections are smaller and happen over a shorter time frame. If this signal’s indications are to come true between the end of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, Crypto Dan expects the market to witness new capital inflows and the creation of additional crypto funds. This rise in demand and liquidity will help bring the market to its peak. BTC Slips Below $95K Meanwhile, analysts are speculating on bitcoin’s short-term price trajectory based on current demand and supply. Long-term investors have been rapidly offloading their holdings to realize profits, while short-term BTC holders have been accumulating; however, it appears demand is no match for supply. Market experts have identified $90,000 and $95,000 as key support levels for BTC, stating that the asset has a higher chance of rallying to $100,000 if it remains above the latter. On the other hand, BTC could tumble all the way to the $80,000 region if it slips below $90,000. At the time of writing, BTC had fallen slightly intraday to $94,800. While the asset holds steady, it remains to be seen how long it will take to break out, as Crypto Dan’s analysis has predicted.

This development bolsters an already extremely strong start to the bull run, with an abrupt 435% monthly gain shattering XRP price projections for the altcoin . As fundamentals build in its favor, XRP seems poised to be a bull market mainstay rolling into 2025. The near term does present some challenges, though. Particularly as a major decline saw much of today’s growth slashed, leaving just a 2.21% increase, a massive 26% surge in trading volume hints towards a sell-off. WisdomTree Pushes for ETF Approval: Could It Be Approved? Investment firm WisdomTree has become the latest participant in the push for an XRP ETF with their recent application , joining the likes of Bitwise and Canary Capital. The approval, of which, could expose XRP to traditional investment markets and lead to significant inflows. The filing comes as Ripple Labs continues its legal battle with the SEC over XRP’s regulatory status, leaving the approval of such products uncertain. However, industry analysts speculate that SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s expected resignation could pave the way for a more favorable regulatory environment, potentially easing the path for XRP-based ETFs under new leadership. XRP Price Analysis: Will Prices Double Again? While today’s reversal could just be a hiccup, the asset shows signs of exhaustion, with the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) deep within overbought territory at 90. A correction seems like a natural and healthy next step to find more stable footing for the next leg up, particularly as the formation of an ascending broadening wedge suggests a continuation of the recent rally. XRP / USDT 4H chart, ascending broadening wedge pattern. Source: Binance. The lower support trendline of the pattern seems a credible local bottom for a correction, aligning with the support zone between $1.9621 and $1.8282. From there, the XRP price can reaffirm its path toward a retest of the pattern’s upper boundary, approaching it’s past $3.85 all-time high – a 60% increase from current prices. However, a 2x and a $5 valuation seem much more likely heading into 2025, especially with the potential approval of an XRP ETF. This Fleeting Opportunity Could Be the Better Play While a 2x for XRP is definitely an appealing prospect, fortune favors the bold – emerging opportunities that hold the potential for truly substantial gains. As “meme coin supercycle” sentiment takes hold and coins like $GOAT and $Pnut experience sudden rises to prominence, strategic investors may find it beneficial to diversify into newer low-cap meme coins with exponential growth potential . One such coin is Pepe Unchained ($PEPU) , a meme coin that transcends conventional utility.

The coin that went from zero to hero, making early investors substantial gains. What if you could turn back time and seize that chance again—this time with a coin that could be even bigger? Well, the clock’s ticking, and there’s a new opportunity waiting for those who missed the boat on Floki Inu. BTFD Coin is here, and it’s already making waves. Launched in late November 2024, BTFD presale is on fire, already catching the eyes of investors, analysts, and meme coin lovers alike. If you’re asking yourself, “Should I dive in or wait?” — here’s the answer: BTFD Coin could be the opportunity you’ve been waiting for. Its presale is creating a buzz, with over $700,000 raised in just the first week, and analysts predicting big gains. But what makes BTFD the next big meme coin in the making? Let’s take a closer look at how BTFD Coin is shaping up to be one of the best meme coins to buy today, and why it’s the next chance to make the most out of this high-reward market before it’s too late. BTFD Coin: The Bull Is Charging—Don’t Miss Your Chance to Own It If you’re on the hunt for the best meme coins to buy today, BTFD Coin is calling your name. Launched in November 2024, its presale has been nothing short of spectacular. In just the first week, BTFD raised over $700,000, with more than 18 billion $BTFD coins sold to over 1,700 bulls, signaling huge demand. The presale has sped through multiple stages, and the coin is still priced at just $0.000058 during Stage 6—but not for long. As the presale continues to progress, the price is set to increase, and those who get in early could be looking at big returns when it eventually hits the public exchange. So, what makes BTFD Coin different from all the other meme coins out there? Let’s start with its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game. This isn’t some gimmick thrown in for fun, it’s a key part of the BTFD ecosystem. The P2E game allows users to earn rewards while engaging in the community, creating an interactive and rewarding experience that many meme coins don’t offer. It’s a real use case that drives BTFD beyond the meme, making it one of the best meme coins to buy today for those looking for more than just hype. One standout feature that’s grabbing attention with BTFD Coin is its staking opportunity. Offering an enticing Annual Percentage Yield (APY), staking $BTFD tokens lets you earn passive income while keeping your investment secure. This is exactly why BTFD is becoming a go-to for investors who aren’t just content holding—they want to see their investments grow. When you pair this with the dedicated and energetic Bulls Squad community, BTFD transforms from just another meme coin into a serious player with long-term potential. If you put $1,000 into BTFD Coin at today’s presale price of $0.000058, you’ll lock in 17,241,379 tokens. When it reaches the predicted listing price of $0.0006, that investment could grow to $10,344—more than 10 times your original amount! Don’t miss out on the chance to get in before the price skyrockets! Floki Inu: Did You Miss Your Shot? Remember when Floki Inu was just another meme coin with a cute name? When it launched, it had its fair share of doubters, but the coin quickly proved them wrong. With a current price of $0.0002276, Floki Inu has increased in value by 76% in the last month alone, showing that its potential is far from a fleeting trend. Early investors who jumped on board when the coin was at its lowest have already seen significant returns, turning a small bet into a big payoff. But here’s the kicker—while Floki Inu has been a solid performer, some are now asking, “Is it too late to join the party?” The price has risen steadily, and investors are still riding the gains, but the big opportunity—getting in at the ground level—has passed. This is where BTFD Coin comes in. If you missed Floki Inu, don’t worry. The next big meme coin might just be BTFD, and it’s still in its presale phase. The question is, will you act now, or let this opportunity slip away just like the Floki Inu boom? The Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin is shaping up to be one of the best meme coins to buy today. With its impressive presale performance, BTFD is positioned to make waves in the meme coin space. If you missed the launch of Floki Inu and regret not getting in earlier, now’s your chance to act fast and secure your spot in the next big meme coin. The BTFD Coin presale won’t last forever, and the opportunity to invest at this price could soon be gone. Don’t miss your chance to be part of something big.

37178141,https://nulltx.com/?p=135122,1733246108,"Best Crypto Coins to Buy: Qubetics Presale FOMO, Ethereum Bulls Eye $4,000, VeChain’s 182% ROI Potential","Cryptocurrency’s at it again, shaking up the game as 2024 unfolds with seismic bull runs and mind-boggling innovation. Ethereum’s momentum is taking it closer to $4,000—a level it hasn’t flirted with in ages. Meanwhile, VeChain’s November rally turned heads, up 153%, with forecasts hinting at an even brighter 2025. And Qubetics ($TICS)? What makes Qubetics such a game-changer? Unlike many of its predecessors, it’s laser-focused on addressing real-world challenges, particularly with its groundbreaking QubeQode IDE. Ethereum and VeChain are no slouches either, but Qubetics stands poised to redefine how businesses and developers implement blockchain technology in practical and impactful ways. Let’s break it down. Qubetics ($TICS): The Next Big Thing Blockchain’s been called revolutionary, but let’s face it: building dApps isn’t exactly a walk in the park. Enter Qubetics’ QubeQode IDE—a user-friendly platform that simplifies the process to the point of ridiculousness. Think of it like Canva, but for blockchain applications. Drag, drop, and—voilà—your app is live. Want to tokenise a supply chain? Done. Looking to create a digital loyalty programme for your cafe? Easy peasy. QubeQode doesn’t just streamline development; it democratises it. Small businesses, solopreneurs, and even mega-corps can dive into blockchain without hiring a team of nerdy coders. Imagine a local farmer tokenising their inventory for buyers or a content creator launching NFTs without breaking a sweat. It’s not just a tool; it’s an invitation for everyone to join the blockchain revolution. The numbers tell a story too. Qubetics is in its 11th presale stage, selling over 261 million $TICS tokens to more than 5,900 holders, raising $4.2 million so far. At $0.0282 per token, there’s a 10% price hike coming this weekend. Miss the boat, and you’ll be kicking yourself when the value shoots to the moon. How high? Analysts predict $0.25 per token by the presale’s end (an 783% ROI), $1 post-presale (3,787% ROI), and $5 within a year. Let’s talk big money: if you put $85,000 into $TICS at today’s price, you’re looking at $754,250 at $1 or a jaw-dropping $15.05 million at $5. That’s not just life-changing—that’s wealth-changing. Ethereum: Marching Towards $4,000 Ethereum’s the backbone of decentralised finance (DeFi) and NFTs, but it’s not resting on its laurels. After busting through the $3,454 resistance last week, ETH is now inching closer to the $4,000 psychological level. The bulls are out in full force, and the daily RSI sits at a healthy 68, signalling room for more growth before hitting overbought territory. What’s fuelling this rally? A mix of improved network scalability, rising adoption in institutional finance, and DeFi’s relentless expansion. Ethereum’s got staying power because it’s not just about today; it’s about what’s next. With Ethereum 2.0 enhancements like sharding on the horizon, the network’s scalability and speed will only get better—a critical factor as DeFi protocols and NFT marketplaces grow more complex. Here’s a scenario: Let’s say ETH hits $4,000 in the next rally. If you’re holding $85,000 worth of Ethereum at $3,691 (current price), you’re cashing out at $92,136. Not bad for a short-term play. And if it heads toward its all-time high of $4,878, you’re sitting on $112,425. The potential upside is solid, but what makes Ethereum a must-have in any portfolio is its role as the infrastructure layer for decentralised applications. But don’t get complacent. A dip below $3,454 could see ETH retest $3,335, presenting a buying opportunity for those who missed the earlier rally. Either way, Ethereum’s a blue-chip asset for a reason, and it’s got plenty of room to grow as crypto adoption broadens. VeChain: Solving Supply Chain Nightmares VeChain might not have Ethereum’s name recognition or Bitcoin’s price tag, but it’s quietly carving out its niche as a blockchain powerhouse. Specialising in supply chain solutions, VeChain’s tech ensures transparency, authenticity, and efficiency in tracking goods—from farm to fork, so to speak. It’s the tech you didn’t know you needed but can’t live without. November was a banner month for VET, surging 153% to $0.0515. And it’s not stopping there. Predictions peg it at $0.06 by January, $0.09 by spring, and $0.108 by October 2025. If you’re thinking long-term, some even predict VeChain could hit $1 within five years. That’s a potential 1,840% return for early adopters. Picture this: You drop $85,000 into VET at $0.0515. By October 2025, at $0.108, that’s $178,688. If it touches $1, we’re talking a cool $1.65 million. That’s the kind of ROI that turns heads and changes bank accounts. Why is VeChain a standout? It’s all about utility. Whether it’s preventing counterfeit goods in luxury markets, ensuring food safety, or tracking carbon credits, VeChain’s got a use case for just about every industry. As global supply chains become more digitised, VeChain’s blockchain solutions are poised to become indispensable. Add favourable regulations under the incoming U.S. administration, and you’ve got a recipe for growth. Time to Make Your Move Crypto doesn’t wait for anyone, and neither should you. Whether it’s Qubetics redefining blockchain with QubeQode, Ethereum powering the DeFi and NFT revolution, or VeChain solving real-world supply chain issues, these are the top crypto by market cap and utility you should consider right now. Qubetics’ presale is your first stop—don’t miss out before the $TICS price jumps 10% this weekend. Load up on Ethereum while it’s surging toward $4,000.

The coin rallied 67.5% in the last 24 hours and 141% in the last seven days to hit $0.5641, the highest price $IOTA has traded at since May, 2022. An announcement yesterday appears to be driving $IOTA’s rocket ride. Voting is now live for a major IOTA network upgrade. According to the official blog post , this upgrade will introduce Move-based smart contracts, fully decentralize the IOTA ledger, and improve scalability. Additionally, it aims to lower transaction costs, introduce $IOTA staking rewards, and establish a target inflation rate of 6% to 7%. [Governance] #IOTA Rebased vote is now open! Vote until Dec 16th to shape the future of the network. Should we adopt the new L1 protocol with Move-based smart contracts, full decentralization, staking & enhanced tokenomics? Let your voice be heard! https://t.co/5tby6mWFfb pic.twitter.com/O1PmSVt4mz — IOTA (@iota) December 2, 2024 There is now a seven-day window for token holders to cast votes. Then, beginning December 9, there will be a seven-day vote counting window. IOTA Network and $IOTA: Price and Primer Despite the fact that IOTA Network and the $IOTA token are listed everywhere on crypto aggregators and written about widely in crypto publications, the tech behind them is not blockchain-based. IOTA operates an alternative distributed ledger system. See, where blockchains store transaction records in blocks of data, which are linked in a chain, IOTA uses a system called “Tangle” which can also be likened to its namesake. The difference in structure allows IOTA to claim it is more scaleable than blockchain-based alternatives. $IOTA launched in 2016 and rode the crest of a wave that saw its price reaching an eye-watering height of $5.25 on December 19, 2017. The token failed to repeat that performance during crypto’s seminal 2021 bull run, reaching a high of $2.52 on April 17. Source: TradingView $IOTA’s sudden rise since December began has resulted in a near-vertical ascent on the graph above. This indicates whale-sized buys that have resulted in an imbalance. As a result, $IOTA’s relative strength index (RSI) has been above 70 and overbought since December began. In the short term, $IOTA holders can expect a correction coming, which may go as low as $0.40 to correct the imbalance, but the coin’s outlook remains bullish. As Altcoin Season Begins, Meme Coin Staking Protocol Crypto All-Stars IOTA Network’s performance highlights how bullish the market is for altcoins. With a pro-crypto President about to take office in the US, the industry may finally get the regulatory clarity it demands. However, innovation abounds across Web3. Flip over to the weird and wonderful world of micro-cap presales, and you’ll find many new species of meme coins that are just launching at rock-bottom prices, offering investors a chance to buy in long before they hit the open market. Those who allocate even a small portion of funds can often exploit some sweltering and unrivaled price booms. Web3’s first cross-chain meme coin staking protocol, Crypto All-Stars , has collected $8 million in presale investments. It is changing the negative perceptions around meme coins by enabling crypto fans to farm them for consistent yield. The platform’s central feature is the MemeVault protocol, which already integrates some of the the world’s biggest meme coins, with more coming later, according to the team. Users can currently stake Pepe Coin, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Floki Inu, Brett, MogCoin, Milady, TurboToken, Toshi The Cat, Coq Inu, and BonkCoin in the MemeVault to earn passive income. The reward rate for staking these coins is an impressive 269%, which is paid out in $STARS. Head to the website to buy $STARS with ETH, USDT, BNB, or even by card.

37177254,https://crypto.news/?p=14315889,1733245843,France proposing tax on unrealized Bitcoin gains,"French lawmakers are debating a tax on unrealized capital gains for cryptocurrencies, potentially altering how assets like Bitcoin are taxed. The proposal would categorize cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ) as “non-productive property,” alongside dormant real estate and luxury items such as yachts. This classification would place them under a proposed “unproductive wealth tax,” replacing the current real estate wealth tax The idea, introduced during the French Senate’s debate on the 2025 budget, suggests taxing increases in cryptocurrency value even if the assets haven’t been sold. This represents a departure from the current system, where taxes on cryptocurrencies are only applied when profits are realized, such as when assets are sold. https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1863915472812380434?s=61&t=Goh7F7TZjoAVMq_tusVLpw Senator Sylvie Vermeillet, the proposal’s sponsor, argued that this change would align cryptocurrency taxation with other wealth categories. Last month, The Tax Law Council in Denmark recommended proposing a bill to tax unrealized gains and losses on crypto assets under an inventory taxation model. The proposed bill aims to address the unfair taxation of crypto investors and simplify the tax rules for crypto assets. You might also like: Coinbase to list MOG meme coin This tax isn’t law….yet The Senate debate included a preliminary vote on the proposal. Notably, only supporting senators were present, meaning the vote does not yet reflect a final decision or broader consensus. If the proposal advances, it would need approval from the French National Assembly before becoming law. For those unfamiliar with the concept, unrealized gains refer to the increased value of an asset that hasn’t been sold. For instance, if Bitcoin’s value rises after purchase but is not sold, the owner currently owes no taxes on that increase. The proposed tax would change this by applying levies on that paper gain, even if the asset isn’t converted to cash. This debate comes amid a global trend of governments grappling with how to regulate and tax cryptocurrencies. In the U.S., crypto taxes only apply when assets are sold. Some countries, like Germany and Portugal, offer tax exemptions for long-term holdings or classify digital assets more leniently.

South Korea Under Emergency Martial law “I declare martial law to protect the free Republic of Korea from the threat of North Korean communist forces, to eradicate the despicable pro-North Korean anti-state forces that are plundering the freedom and happiness of our people, and to protect the free constitutional order,” Yoon stated during his late-night address. The declaration has triggered immediate reactions in South Korea’s crypto market. Arkham Intelligence reported a marked increase in trading activity, with large inflows of USDT (Tether) observed on the Upbit exchange.

National Assembly Challenges Martial Law Declaration The emergency declaration has not gone unchallenged. Ki Young Ju, CEO of the analytics firm CryptoQuant , expressed his concerns on social media. “The South Korean president has just declared martial law,” he posted. “All media and publications must now be officially censored by the martial law authorities. We all need to take refuge in X.” The President declared martial law, but just past midnight, lawmakers urgently gathered in the National Assembly unanimously passed a resolution to lift it.

Altcoins have dominated the crypto market surge since November 2024. Analysts expect more altcoins to surge amid growing bullish momentum. TradingView’s data reveals the cryptocurrency market capitalization surged 7.2% a few days into December to reach $3.49 trillion, marking a record for the all-important crypto metric. The recent December surge reflects the continuation of a massive rally that started after the crucial cryptocurrency metric bounced off significant support in August. According to TradingView’s data, the cryptocurrency market cap bounced off $1.69 trillion after a 6-month decline and rallied 107% to reach a new all-time high. The crypto metric’s rally signifies a capital influx amid growing demand for digital assets. It is worth noting that the crypto market gained $1.21 trillion in November alone, making it the most bullish month in the history of cryptocurrencies.

The strategic move looked to position a more seamless accessibility-to-functionality in the fast-expanding Web3 ecosystem. On December 3, Tokenproof’s founder and CEO, Fonz O, announced that Yuga Labs had acquired the Tokenproof technology and onboarded several team members. Tokenproof is a specialist in building infrastructure for the verification of NFT ownership in the real world, making it a natural fit for Yuga Labs’ ambitious vision. The two companies have been collaborating since 2022, forging a strong foundation for this acquisition. Leveraging Tokenproof’s Expertise According to Greg Solano, the Yuga Labs co-founder: “Together with Tokenproof, we hacked up a host of thorny problems, so your monkey jpeg could safely, efficiently get you into the festival across the world.” This acquisition will integrate Tokenproof’s talented tech team into Yuga Labs’ research and development division, The Workshop. Launched in August amid organizational restructuring, The Workshop focuses on innovative projects, including Otherside, Yuga Labs’ gamified, interoperable metaverse. This move demonstrates Yuga Labs’ commitment to continue pushing the frontiers of NFT and Web3 technologies toward more mainstream use and enjoyment. Community Support and Industry Context The move has been highly welcomed by the NFT community. Many developers have come forward to appreciate Tokenproof’s efforts in enabling tangible utilities for NFTs, especially for Yuga Labs’ iconic ape-themed assets. But the overall NFT market remains unpredictable, despite the strategic acquisition. According to CryptoSlam, in May 2024, NFT sales volumes soared above $500 million, though the peak occurred earlier in March at $1.6 billion in sales. The market up-and-down performance has seen companies such as Kraken shut down their respective NFT marketplaces to allocate resources to other initiatives. Conclusion By acquiring Tokenproof’s tech team, Yuga Labs solidifies its position as a leader in NFT innovation. This strategic move not only enhances the utility of its NFTs but also signals its dedication to evolving the Web3 landscape. As the industry navigates both challenges and opportunities, collaborations like this will be crucial in shaping the future of blockchain technology.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/yuga-labs-acquires-tokenproof-tech-team-to-boost-nft/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

Here's What That Means for the Stock.,"The analyst who co-wrote this piece owns shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR).    Despite all the weird memecoins and degen behavior in 2024, ETFs are in the running for story of the year in cryptocurrency investing.    And that story — which began when bitcoin and ether exchange-traded funds debuted to great fanfare — might not be over. After a sixfold surge in its stock price this year, Michael Saylor's bitcoin (BTC) investment firm MicroStrategy (MSTR) looks poised to join one of the biggest exchange-traded funds around, the $312 billion Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ).    That fund tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index. Every December, Nasdaq shakes up the membership list for that benchmark, which then filters into the Invesco fund (which copies Nasdaq's decisions exactly). The Nasdaq-100, roughly speaking, tracks the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange. There are other eligibility criteria that must be met — and MicroStrategy checks those boxes.    “The index is passive and rules-based and it should just follow the rules. The market is indicating that MSTR belongs in the index and thus the ETF, and therefore it should be added,” said James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.    This conveys more than bragging rights; it's membership in an exclusive club alongside giants like Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) in an ETF that regularly boosts daily trading volume in the tens of billions of dollars. It guarantees passive, permanent capital will flow in.    Getting added ""will open up flows to a new class of investors that would not otherwise have singularly bought a stock like MSTR on their own,"" said Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise. ""Indexing, in a way, is a financial tool, like banking is a financial tool, because it is a liquidity transformation tool.""    The decision would also essentially bring more bitcoin into the index. Saylor has loaded up MicroStrategy with a $37 billion stockpile of bitcoin over the past four years, transforming his decades-old software firm into one of the largest crypto investors in the world. To conceptualize how much bitcoin that is, Bloomberg data shows that the $37 billion holdings are now worth more than Nvidia's (NVDA) $34.8 billion (NVDA) and Tesla's (TSLA) $33.6 billion cash and marketable securities holdings. Now, the fortunes of a prominent conventional stock index and ETF would ride to an even greater degree on bitcoin. Tesla is already in the index and holds the cryptocurrency.    ""For millions of passive investors, owning ETFs like QQQ (which tracks the Nasdaq-100) will provide indirect bitcoin exposure to their portfolios through MicroStrategy's holdings,"" said Ben Werkman, founder of quant research firm NumerisX. ""Since these funds are often buyers at any price, their participation has the ability to potentially exert significant upward pressure on the price of the equity.""     This is all technically theoretical at this point. Nasdaq will announce its decision on Dec. 13, with the membership shuffle taking place a week later. The company will base its decision on market data as of last Friday.     Among eligible companies, MicroStrategy is the 66th-biggest by market capitalization, according to Seyffart; the 75 largest companies automatically get into the 100-stock index. That likely equates to more than $1 billion of new money coming into the stock as Invesco buys shares to match MicroStrategy's weighting in the index.    A potential wrinkle: Will the Nasdaq committee that makes this decision still consider MicroStrategy a non-financial company, said Mark Palmer, managing director of The Benchmark Co. Has it strayed too far from its software roots?     ""MicroStrategy at this point meets the eligibility criteria for inclusion,"" Palmer said. However, ""its bitcoin acquisition strategy could make [the Nasdaq committee's] analysis a bit less straightforward.”    If MicroStrategy does get in, the resulting impact — or lack thereof — could preview what might happen if the stock gets big enough to join the even more influential S&P 500 Index, something that could happen in early 2026, Palmer added.    Entering an index can be extremely beneficial for a publicly traded company. The question is whether the majority of returns get front-run before the inclusion or during the company's time in the index.    When Tesla (TSLA) entered the S&P 500 on Dec. 21 2020, it traded around $200 a share. The stock had run up 10-fold since December 2019 heading into the inclusion. Tesla went on to make new highs in November 2021 at $400 a share. In other words, the best returns came before the index addition.    Nasdaq research shows outsized returns do tend to precede the stock entering the index, not after.     Even still, MicroStrategy getting added would be another step toward bitcoin becoming integrated into the conventional financial system.

In an unpredictable market, choosing projects that offer innovation, scalability, and strong potential for future growth is essential. This article explores the top contenders in the crypto world that have consistently demonstrated resilience, cutting-edge technology, and tremendous growth potential — BlockDAG, Bitcoin, Solana, and XRP. Keep reading to see why these four cryptocurrencies should be a key part of any long-term crypto strategy. 1. BlockDAG: A Game-Changing Crypto with Massive Growth Potential BlockDAG (BDAG) isn’t just another blockchain project; it’s a game-changer. Using Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) instead of traditional blockchain structures, BlockDAG solves common issues like scalability and high transaction fees that slow down many other cryptos. With its innovative design, BlockDAG processes transactions in parallel, making it faster, cheaper, and more efficient. This makes it an ideal platform for high-demand industries like decentralized finance (DeFi), supply chain management, and digital payments. BlockDAG has made a big splash recently by raising over $154.5 million during its presale, with more than 16.7 billion coins already sold. The price per coin is currently $0.0234, but early backers have already seen an incredible 2240% surge in value. The momentum surrounding BlockDAG is growing fast. It’s not just the presale success that’s catching attention — BlockDAG introduces the BDAG250 bonus code, featuring a 5-tier system boosting rewards with each purchase. Users start with a 100% bonus, followed by 130% on the second buy, while remaining bonuses are revealed as surprises, encouraging ongoing participation and unlocking greater rewards with every step. With so much interest from traders and crypto enthusiasts, BlockDAG is positioned to be a leader in the blockchain space. As more businesses adopt BlockDAG’s innovative technology, the value of BDAG coins is expected to rise significantly. If you’re looking for a high-reward opportunity with massive growth potential, BlockDAG is one of the best choices for long-term profitability. 2. Bitcoin: The Unshakable Leader of Crypto Bitcoin continues reigning as the first and most recognized cryptocurrency, often called ""digital gold."" Its limited supply of 21 million coins has created a scarcity that drives demand year after year. Bitcoin’s reputation as a hedge against inflation adds to its appeal, making it a staple in many portfolios. Bitcoin remains a dominant force in the market, with growing institutional interest reinforcing its strong upward trajectory. Although its explosive growth may slow down, Bitcoin’s solid foundation and widespread recognition make it a stable choice for long-term growth. Its high price point might make it less accessible for some, but its reliability makes it a safe and lucrative option for those seeking security in their crypto holdings. 3. Solana: Fast, Scalable, and Full of Potential Solana is one of the fastest-growing blockchain platforms, known for its blazing transaction speeds and low fees. It’s quickly becoming the go-to blockchain for decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and DeFi platforms. Solana's scalability sets it apart from other platforms, making it capable of handling high volumes of transactions without compromising speed or cost. Despite experiencing technical difficulties, Solana has continued to grow and become a major player in the blockchain world. As the platform expands its ecosystem, the value of Solana’s native token, SOL, continues to rise. With its impressive scalability, Solana is well-positioned to challenge Ethereum and Bitcoin in the coming years. Solana is a strong contender for long-term growth if you’re betting on a blockchain with massive potential. 4. XRP: Transforming Cross-Border Payments XRP is revolutionizing cross-border payments by providing a faster and cheaper alternative to traditional payment systems like SWIFT. Ripple, the company behind XRP, has created a global network of financial institutions increasingly adopting XRP for international transactions and remittances. XRP’s ability to settle payments quickly and affordably makes it a go-to solution for businesses looking to streamline global payments. With regulatory clarity on the horizon, especially as Ripple’s legal battles with the SEC near resolution, XRP’s value is poised for significant growth. Analysts are projecting a price target of $3.84, with some speculating that XRP could reach as high as $10. For long-term investors, XRP presents a unique opportunity in cross-border payments. Top Cryptos for Long-Term Growth You Can't Miss For those aiming to build a long-term strategy, diversification is the key to balancing innovation with stability. Bitcoin, though costly, remains a cornerstone for secure holdings, while Solana's unmatched scalability offers the potential for remarkable growth. XRP shines with its game-changing approach to cross-border payments, and BlockDAG’s advanced technology positions it as a strong contender for future dominance. These four options provide a balanced mix for portfolio building, catering to steady growth seekers and those ready to take higher-risk opportunities with higher rewards. For those eyeing a fresh project with explosive potential, BlockDAG stands out. Its impressive 2240% growth, over $154.5 million presale achievement, and current affordability compared to others make it a top pick for those looking to maximize their holdings from the ground up.

The currency gained over 160% in November after an outstanding month, with its pattern looking bullish nowadays, hence setting the stage for some profits. Related Reading: Cardano To Hit $10? Analyst Thinks It’s Happening This Cycle Bullish Patterns Indicate Potential Benefits A high-tight flag pattern is appearing on Dogecoin’s price chart, according to new research. This unusual technical pattern usually means that people are strongly hopeful and that a breakout might be coming soon. Trader Tardigrade said that this pattern often comes before big price changes, which makes it an important thing for buyers to keep an eye on. If the pattern stays the same, Dogecoin could hit new highs. Some analysts think it could reach $1, which would be a 155% increase from where it is now. #Dogecoin LTF (2-hour) Symmetrical Triangle perfectly BREAKOUT 🔥 This LTF breakout could starts off another $Doge HTF Bull Rally 🚀 https://t.co/ILfXFVuhEH pic.twitter.com/j1Oc4um9LQ — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) December 1, 2024 More ambitious targets also speak of even more important events. Some predictions are telling of the possibility that this rising trend might push prices from $5 to as much as $10 with Dogecoin. In support of this optimism lies strong market enthusiasm and FOMO at the retail investor level. Because this excitement is building up, many are waiting to know whether Dogecoin might breach its current consolidation range. Market Sentiment & Technical Indicators People still think that Dogecoin will go up in value, and there are a number of important signs that back this view. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 61.86, which means that the price has stayed in the positive trend even though it has fallen from its previous highs. This could mean that the price will now settle down for a short time. Dogecoin’s price is also above its 50-, 100-, and 200-day exponential moving averages (EMAs), which supports the upward trend. However, attention needs to be focused on critical support levels. To continue on an upward path, Dogecoin will need to remain above $0.35 and penetrate resistance at $0.45. A successful breach could open the doors to higher price action and further cement a bullish narrative.

Some analysts expect that in the coming months if this trend will continue, it will have Dogecoin overperform Bitcoin by 2,400%. The formation of these bullish patterns has been in a progressive pattern, while overall market dynamics favor altcoins. Meanwhile, it is anticipated that Dogecoin will conclude the year by trading within a trading channel that spans $ 0.385819 and $ 0.41998. This would result in a -4.16% decrease in the price of DOGE in comparison to the current price, presuming that the average price in December was $0.398415. In other words, short sellers would have the potential to earn a profit of 7.19% if DOGE adheres to the prediction.

This is traced to renewed investor confidence and Ripple’s expanding utility. However, while the XRP price captures the spotlight, a lesser-known altcoin, PropiChain , is quietly gearing up for an explosive 25,304% gain by Q1 2025. This emerging player is redefining the crypto space with real-world asset tokenization and other innovative features, drawing the attention of early adopters and experienced investors. XRP Price Analysis: Heading for the $10 Target The XRP price has seen an impressive surge, rising by 24.5% in the past 24 hours and trading at $2.37, its highest since 2018’s peak rally. This XRP price resurgence is largely attributed to Ripple’s ongoing victories against the SEC, which have reignited investor confidence in the token. With XRP’s market cap reaching $135 billion and trading volume climbing to $38 billion, the cryptocurrency community is optimistic about the XRP price’s path to a $10 milestone. Recent political developments, including the SEC chairman’s potential departure and Donald Trump’s election victory, have bolstered market sentiment for cryptocurrencies, particularly those like XRP, which have significant utility. This hidden altcoin, PropiChain , is set to follow a similar trajectory to the XRP price, combining real-world utility with innovative tech. PropiChain: Redefining Crypto Investments with Real-World Utility PropiChain is shaking up the cryptocurrency landscape by bridging the digital and physical worlds through its groundbreaking approach to real estate investment. Its key feature, tokenization, allows investors to own fractional shares of high-value properties without the traditional entry barriers. Investors can own a piece of a luxury apartment for just a fraction of the cost. This democratization of property ownership has captured the attention of seasoned investors looking for tangible, asset-backed opportunities in the volatile crypto market. AI-driven analytics further sweeten the deal, providing investors with predictive insights on market trends and rental yields. PropiChain’s AI tools help you easily make data-driven decisions when you’re looking to start your investments, giving you the most profitable offers. Its integration into the Metaverse takes innovation further, allowing users to explore properties virtually and connect with other investors before committing. Also, the smart contracts ensure that transactions are secure, transparent, and automated, eliminating middlemen and reducing costs. PropiChain is a practical and forward-thinking platform for wealth generation in this digital age. PropiChain Presale Grants Early Access to a Potential 25,304% Rally PropiChain’s presale is on, starting at an accessible $0.004 per token. It is structured to reward early adopters with substantial returns. As demand grows, the price increases in tiers, giving investors who join now a chance to maximize their ROI. Let’s put the numbers into perspective: a $1,000 investment at this presale price could turn into a staggering $253,040 if the platform achieves its predicted 25,304% growth by Q1 2025. Compare this to the XRP price, which is targeting $10 from its current price of $2. While promising a solid return, the gain is smaller than PropiChain’s massive potential. This presale is a golden opportunity for seasoned investors and newcomers to secure a stake in one of the most promising altcoins before it becomes mainstream. Conclusion As the XRP price eyes a $10 target, PropiChain stands out as the dark horse ready to redefine crypto investments with its innovative blend of real-world utility and cutting-edge technology. With a presale that offers unparalleled potential returns, the time to act is now. Don’t miss the chance to join the early adopters and ride the wave to a possible 25,304% rally by 2025. This is your opportunity to be part of the next big thing in crypto before everyone else catches on.

The DUM presale is set to end in less than 5 days after having already raised over $713k. FreeDum Fighters has impressed whales and retailers alike with its entertaining twist on real-world US politics. Moreover, its community-centric tokenomics, multiple avenues for passive income and security audits have brought smart money traders on board, some of whom are calling it the next 100x crypto. What Is FreeDum Fighters? FreeDum Fighters is a unique PolitiFi token. Unlike most politically-themed meme coins, it isn’t a hyperpartisan project. Instead, it is simulating US politics in an alternative, highly mechanized universe. The project showcases the ultimate showdown between two fictional political parties. The FreeDum Party is led by MAGATRON, a mechanized figurehead inspired by Donald Trump. It also includes a mad scientist, inspired by Elon Musk, who is looking to establish a colony on Mars. Somehow, the FreeDum Party has also brought DOGE under its banner. Meanwhile, the LibDum Party is led by Kamacop 9000, a Kamala Harris-inspired figurehead who is also known as “the hunter of injustice”. The party also includes Pepe The Frog and a very confused-looking Joe Biden. Unlike the Democratic Party in the real world, Kamacop’s LibDum doesn’t have to wait for another 4-years to strike back. Instead, they can continue to receive votes from DUM holders and make a comeback. Each party has its own staking pool, with a different reward rate. For instance, the FreeDum Party staking pool is offering passive income at an attractive 231% APY while LibDum voters are earning a reward rate of 345%. This means that DUM holders who stake their coins not only vote for their favourite party but also earn attractive passive income. In fact, 20% of the total DUM token supply has been allocated towards staking rewards. In fact, they can also win secret airdrops by participating in the project’s weekly engagement events like debates, which will be organized on FreeDum Fighters’ social media accounts. 10% of the DUM token supply is reserved for the debate rewards. The developer team has also announced a meme contest. 5 winners with the best PolitiFi memes will win $200 each in DUM coins. 5 winners. 200 $USDT each 💸With the presale coming to an end, we are running a meme contest via Gleam! Make sure to follow the link to see all the rules 👇 https://t.co/jX6DIfPZ0M pic.twitter.com/hgPsQTWwT2 — FreeDum Fighters (@Freedum_Fighter) November 22, 2024 Meme coin enthusiasts will have many more exciting opportunities for winning attractive community rewards. They can stay up-to-date by following FreeDum Fighters’ X or Telegram accounts. Is DUM The Next 100x Crypto? The PolitiFi meta isn’t going out of fashion anytime soon, especially with Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20th. There is a reason why the Tooker Kurlson coin is up by 17% over the past 24 hours. Similarly, TRUMP 4 7, a new meme coin, is up by nearly 20% in the same period. Notably, FreeDum Fighters isn’t dependent on just one political personality. By cleverly including the likes of Donald Trump and Elon Musk in its fictional world, the meme coin could stay relevant for the entirety of Donald Trump’s administration. For instance, Elon Musk will be in front of the US Congress on December 5th for a Department of Government Efficiency hearing which will result in a surge of interest in the PolitiFi sector. The DUM coin is launching on exchanges just a few days later. Moreover, its unique staking solution, weekly debates, community-centric tokenomics and multiple security audits make DUM a meme coin with strong fundamentals. It is, therefore, no surprise that smart money investors are bullish on its upside potential. A few prominent analysts are even calling it the next 100x meme coin, especially due to its microcap valuation. However, sidelined investors have less than 5 days to jump on the DUM bandwagon and reap the maximum rewards. They can visit the project’s presale website and buy the meme coin with just a few clicks using the over-the-counter widget.

Solana Many investors expect Solana (SOL) to rocket your portfolio by 8500% throughout the altcoin season. As it leads the crypto industry with its technological advances and strategic posture, Solana could lead this cycle. Solana’s momentum has increased due to the likelihood of a spot ETF, especially under the Trump administration’s pro-crypto posture. Solana might break $300, with $270-$290 being key price levels in December and Q1 2025. Solana’s performance matches market trends, especially excessive greed on the Fear and Greed Index, boosting positive momentum. Solana, only 5% shy of a new all-time high, can capitalize on the market mood for a 2-10x climb in 2025. Given these reasons, Solana’s growth possibilities make it a top candidate for high returns and crypto ecosystem dominance.

In the past week, Stellar’s price has risen over 100%. CoinMarketCap data shows its value rose between $0.23 and $0.48, and its market cap quadrupled from $7 billion to $14 billion, indicating positive momentum. Crypto researcher Ahmed also expects Stellar to rise to $0.60, which excites traders. Stellar is trading above its 20-day and 50-day EMAs on TradingView, indicating a bullish trend. The MACD level around 0.10 shows that XLM is in the buy zone, making it a good entry point for investors eager to capitalize on this rocket-like surge. Stellar’s rising momentum and good market indications position it as a formidable cryptocurrency that might yield huge rewards during the alt season. VeChain VeChain (VET) has emerged as one of the altcoins that many are excited about during the alt season, given its blockchain functionalities. In the year 2024, the company embedded AI analytics on VeChain, a high-end supply chain management and enterprise blockchain platform, to improve safety in food, pharma, and luxury goods transparency and traceability. Such a strategic enhancement further cements VeChain’s status as the leading enterprise blockchain in industries that is deep into accuracy and accountability. VeChain’s demonstrated ability to streamline supply chains and cutting-edge AI technologies make it a top candidate to rocket your portfolio by 8500%. VeChain’s swift adoption by global organizations guarantees its long-term value and significant influence on real-world industries, creating an ideal environment for altcoin season gains. Toncoin Toncoin is one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in, potentially increasing your portfolio by 8500% throughout the altcoin season. Toncoin, a layer-1 blockchain built by Telegram and administered by the TON Foundation, integrates seamlessly into Telegram through TON Space, making crypto transactions easier for millions of users. Toncoin’s proof-of-stake mechanism supports environmental sustainability and a growing ecosystem with Tap-to-Earn and DeFi apps. Major investors’ strategic acquisitions of Toncoin demonstrate its market potential and growing faith in its long-term value. Toncoin could outperform Bitcoin as it separates from Telegram’s regulatory issues. Toncoin’s value might grow enormously by 2025 as it enters new areas like advertising, making it a promising asset for the next cryptocurrency surge. Conclusion Altcoin season offers investors a chance to profit from high-return cryptocurrencies. Rexas Finance, Solana, Stellar, VeChain, and Toncoin might boost investors’ portfolios by 8500% or more. Rexas Finance’s groundbreaking tokenization of real-world assets, Toncoin’s smooth Telegram integration, and VeChain’s AI-driven supply chain management advancements have benefits.

In a more bullish setting, the most dangerous words can be “it has already pumped.” When tokens and their narratives are favored by the market, the initial pump, sometimes memed as a “test pump,” can be considered a lightbulb moment for the market. In a bear market, tokens often get one large price surge before slowly grinding back down to their pre-pump levels, referred to as a “scam pump.” In the bull market, tokens will get a large pump and retrace slightly before soaring much higher.

The price surge has captured the attention of most traders and investors, with many projecting that more is yet to come after the $0.5 breakout. Why is the IOTA price rising? Today’s IOTA price surge can be attributed to several factors, with the most significant being the vote to upgrade the IOTA Mainnet to the Rebased protocol going live. IOTA @iota · Follow [Governance] 🚨 #IOTA Rebased vote is now open! 🚨 Vote until Dec 16th to shape the future of the network. Should we adopt the new L1 protocol with Move-based smart contracts, full decentralization, staking & enhanced tokenomics? Let your voice be heard! 🗳️ blog.iota.org/iota-rebased-g… 5:00 PM · Dec 2, 2024 291 Reply Copy link Read 26 replies The Rebased upgrade is packed with several important features aimed at improving IOTA’s scalability, decentralization, and overall functionality. It includes the introduction of staking rewards, which will allow users to earn IOTA tokens, alongside a target inflation rate between 6% and 7%. Another major change that would come with the Rebased upgrade is the full decentralization of the IOTA ledger, as well as the implementation of Move-based smart contracts, which would enable developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) on the IOTA network. Furthermore, the upgrade will introduce a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism and a mechanism for adaptive fee burning, which will lower transaction costs and make the network more efficient. These improvements are designed to attract more developers to the IOTA ecosystem, as the network moves towards decentralization and aims to bypass Shimmer, IOTA’s canary network. Bulls targeting $0.70 after IOTA broke past $0.5 IOTA’s price surge pushed its market capitalization to over $1.7 billion with its trading volume exceeding $700 million. The surge coincides with the broader momentum seen across the cryptocurrency market. According to the Altcoin Season Index, many altcoins have been outperforming Bitcoin (BTC), signalling that investor interest is shifting away from the leading cryptocurrency toward altcoins like IOTA. Additionally, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has soared to 76, indicating strong bullish sentiment within the market. Many experts predict that IOTA could continue its upward trajectory, with some forecasting that the altcoin could reach $0.70 in the short term and even as high as $2.60 to $3.50 in the mid-term. However, it’s important to note that technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Stochastic Oscillator are showing overbought levels, suggesting that a pullback may be imminent before IOTA can continue its rally toward these higher targets.

Naturally, degens are piling into memecoins on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), with ARMY - which we flagged in the Telegram group at $2M - surging to $100M over the weekend before pulling back. While it’s too early to tell if XRP season will fizzle out just like Tron and other brief metas, it’s always good to be prepared for the next potential 10x trade.

37178126,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656546,1733244626,Bitcoin (BTC) Crashes 33% In South Korea Amid Increasing Political Turmoil,"Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a violent drop in South Korean exchanges amid the growing political crisis in the country. Following a recent announcement by the country’s President, the flagship crypto and other crypto assets saw a brief sell-off that plunged their prices by over 30%. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Could See A Correction Despite Historic Monthly Close, $400 Still On Sight? South Korea Declares First Martial Law In 44 Years On Tuesday night, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared an “emergency martial law” for the first time in 44 years, causing panic among Koreans and kickstarting a massive sell-off of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The Korean JoongAng Daily explains that a declaration of martial law replaces civilian government with military rule and suspends civilian legal processes for military powers. Additionally, it allows measures like “restricting freedom of speech, publication, assembly and association, special changes to the authority of governments or courts, and a warrant system by the provisions of related laws.” Nonetheless, if the parliament requests the lifting of martial law, with the consent of a majority of its members, the president must do so. In a televised briefing, Yoon stated that the measure was taken to “eradicate pro-North Korean forces and protect the constitutional democratic order.” The President accused the country’s opposition of sympathizing with North Korea and anti-state activities. It’s worth noting that the opposition Democratic Party has a majority in the South Korean parliament, which has seemingly complicated Yoon’s efforts to push his agenda. In his statement, the Korean President didn’t announce specific measures but cited the opposition’s motion to impeach top prosecutors and reject the government’s budget proposal. Through this martial law, I will rebuild and protect the free Republic of Korea, which is falling into the depths of national ruin. I will eliminate anti-state forces as quickly as possible and normalize the country. Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-Myung announced they would attempt to nullify Yoon’s order but expressed concern that the military forces would act against the parliament members. Bitcoin And XRP See Negative Kimchi Premium Following the news, the price of Bitcoin saw a sharp correction against its South Korean Won (KRW) pair in local exchanges, dropping 27% on Upbit, Korea’s largest crypto platform. The flagship cryptocurrency fell from the 132 million KRW mark, worth around $92,000, to as low as 88.26 million KRW, around $62,000. However, it has since recovered from the nosedive, trading again above the pre-crash levels. At the same time, Bitcoin recorded a price drop on global exchanges, falling momentarily below the $94,000 support before jumping back to the $95,000-$96,000 range on platforms like Binance, ByBit, and OKX. Similarly, XRP saw its price retrace 60% from the 4,000 KRW mark to as low as 1,623 KRW, worth around $1.23. The cryptocurrency has recovered from the fall in the last hour, trading at 3,600 KRW, valued at $2.52. Related Reading: Cardano Next In Line After XRP? ADA Price Targets $4.88 In Epic Breakout According to Wu Blockchain, the reason behind the negative “Kimchi Premium” is that Korean exchanges do not allow institutional market makers. This, alongside the excessive traffic, “caused prices to be unable to synchronize in a short period of time.” Ultimately, the latest reports revealed that the Parliament passed the vote to nullify the martial law, ending it after three hours. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at 133.2 million KWR in Upbit.

37177968,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51277,1733244363,How BestChange Helps You Stay Ahead in a Volatile Crypto Market,"Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Tether, and countless others experience a wide range of price swings. A token price can shift by more than 10% to 20% up or downwards in a single day. This means that a trader can make massive gains or serious losses within a short time. Keeping up with current rates is a compulsory practice for crypto buyers and traders. In cases where token prices are at the start of a major plummet, traders can sell their tokens fast to mitigate further losses. Traders can hold crypto whose price is constantly gaining in anticipation of selling at higher prices and making bigger returns. Cryptocurrency exchanges such as BestChange.com have narrowed the information gap with live rate monitoring, allowing their users to make informed decisions and trade when the market is favorable. This practice can dull down the effects of rapid price shifts. About BestChange BestChange is one of the most famous online crypto exchanges registered in Dubai, UAE, under the name Agretis Software Design LLC. The site is accessible worldwide with over 370 vetted crypto exchangers and an extensive list of cryptocurrencies. Despite the volatile trends of the crypto market recently, BestChange has maintained its reliability and high service delivery to its users. Why Is The Crypto Market So Volatile? The crypto market changes rapidly resulting in enormous gains or substantial losses real quick. Some of the factors affecting crypto market prices causing major swings include; The speculative nature of cryptocurrencies. Crypto prices are affected by the slightest changes in investor sentiments. Rumors of positive regulatory changes, for example, can swing the prices up in a matter of hours. Fear of missing out can surge the prices while panic selling can cause major declines. The maturity/immaturity of the crypto market. Unlike the traditional financial system which has had decades to grow organically and stabilize, the crypto arena is relatively young. The crypto market is less understood and has fewer participants, making it less stable. Adoption level in the global market. The global market has not fully embraced crypto as a stable financial alternative to fiat money. The fear of losing crypto investments keeps the buying and holding low. Low liquidity for smaller cryptocurrencies. There has not been enough embracing of most altcoins to attract enough buyers and sellers and keep their prices stable. The low liquidity means slight changes in market activities can cause huge shifts in prices. BestChange’s Response To Crypto Market Volatility The high volatility in the crypto market can mean great opportunities or equivalent losses. Quick changes can stir excitement when prices are gaining and cause panic when declining rapidly. Bestchange has put up strategies aimed at combating huge shifts in crypto assets. Crypto exchanges can use market analytical tools or change trading strategies to include fast or delayed actions to avoid losses. Diversification is one of the strategies that keep losses at a minimum by putting ‘eggs’ in different baskets. Unless an unlikely scenario occurs where the entire crypto market is in distress, most coins fluctuate at different times. A trader can lose with one coin and cover the deficit with a major gain in a different investment. Using live-crypto rates, traders on the BestChange platform can interpret impending fluctuations and take the necessary actions. Holding when the rates are gaining can increase the net returns while fast selling when the prices are falling can prevent losses. BestChange has a notification feature that alerts traders when rates favor desired returns. Alerts on fast declining rates can be a signal to sell fast and reduce the risk of losing money. Market timing; A risky trading strategy that involves buying low and selling high. The strategy is very difficult to achieve even for experienced traders. For the few who prefer lower-risk engagements, focusing on long-term trading positions is preferred instead of short gambles. BestChange’s Trading Tools That Monitor Market Volatility Staying alert in the crypto trading arena is essential in maintaining maximum profits amid volatile prices. Knowing when to hold and when to sell your crypto tokens fact can be the difference between good returns and losing all your investment. BestChange users can leverage the platforms’s tools to stay up-to-date in the market. Notification features and exchanger monitor tools if utilized correctly, can keep you from ever making losses. Notification Feature For Minimizing Losses During High Market Volatility The notification feature gives the traders a warning when unusual fluctuations in rates have been detected. If the crypto price is on a downward path, traders can quickly execute a sale getting out of a position that could otherwise increase the risk of further losses. Real-time updates: With live rates on the monitor, traders can detect fluctuating rates to transact accordingly. Leveraging Bestchange Features For Quick Trades. The volatile cryptocurrency market requires fast executions of transactions. Rates can change within seconds and affect transactions that are already in the pipeline. That is why fast transaction speed is important. Traders want to initiate an exchange and have it completed before that rate change. The calculator tool on the platform gives the traders the amount they will receive at the final stage of the transaction. Fast conversions can increase the overall trading speed. Bestchange Rate History The previous rates history for each listed crypto can be used to predict market trends. For example, rates that rise and fall in repetitive cycles can be used to predict the next price trend hence informing traders to act at the optimal time. Previous trends in rate fluctuations can be used to predict whether the current market conditions are likely to persist or reverse. Anticipating Market Shifts With Data From The Live-Rate Monitoring Tool Live rates from the BestChange Exchanger monitor can be studied closely to identify the direction of growth a crypto is headed. Trades are informed by live data. Bestchange’s Strategy For Staying Ahead In The Volatile Crypto Market Bestchange has employed various tools and trading strategies to keep its users ahead in the highly fluctuating market. The site has specialized its focus on improving crypto liquidity by pooling exchangers and a variety of listed tokens. Increasing market liquidity will automatically lead to wider adoption of crypto in day-to-day activities. Are You Ready To Start Trading On A Trusted Crypto Exchange?

37177095,https://cryptonews.com/?p=315537,1733244170,"Litecoin Surges to Two-Year High – How Quickly Can LTC Hit $1,000?","Litecoin has jumped by 10% in the past 24 hours, racing to $130 as the cryptocurrency market remains flat today. LTC has now reached its highest level since February 2022, with the alt up by 46% in a week and by 92% in a month. Yet what’s particularly bullish about Litecoin is that it’s still a long way down from its ATH of $410, which it set back in May 2021. In other words, it still has lots of catching up to do, and with discount-hungry investors piling into it, it could continue to rise to new highs over the coming weeks. Litecoin Surges to Two-Year High – How Quickly Can LTC Hit $1,000? LTC’s current rally began at the end of the weekend, when its relative strength index (purple) rose as high as 80, which usually indicates overbuying. However, Litecoin rose even higher after the RSI dipped to 50 yesterday, and it seems that it could do the same thing again today. Source: TradingView Its trading volume remains very high at $3.8 billion, which is its highest for well over a year. This signals very strong demand from buyers, with bullishness stemming not only from the general bull market, but from expectations that Litecoin could be one of the next coins to benefit from an ETF. JUST IN: Litecoin is listed as eligible cryptocurrencies for Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF filed It is not yet guaranteed but the likelihood is good. https://t.co/VFdYW6NZsC $LTC #Litecoin pic.twitter.com/ByHC8HDwKv — Litecoin Magazine Ł (@LitecoinMag) November 26, 2024 And when you add the fact that LTC is still 68% down from its ATH of $410, it has lots of potential for rallying more aggressively than many other major tokens in the next few weeks, if not for longer. It’s also worth remembering that after Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana and XRP, Litecoin is the most popular cryptocurrency among digital asset funds, according to data from CoinShares . This raises the possibility of Litecoin ETFs, given that there is a pre-existing demand for such funds. And based on such factors, as well as on the bullishness that has followed last month’s US election, many holders and traders are predicting even bigger gains for Litecoin in 2025. Believe it or not but this was just the beginning for #Litecoin .

High-Potential Alternatives For traders looking to go beyond major cryptocurrencies, there’s currently a wealth of exciting new tokens hitting the market, including several presale coins that look ready to blow up once they list. Near the top of this list is Crypto All-Stars (STARS), an ERC-20 coin that has raised a huge $7.9 million in its soon-to-be-ending sale. The All-Stars are racing to success! Only up from here! pic.twitter.com/oayNkg0aYk — Crypto All-Stars (@all_stars_coin) December 2, 2024 Crypto All-Stars is winning over so many investors because of its ‘MemeVault’, a first-of-its-kind protocol through which you can stake any and every meme coin. The token’s protocol employs the ERC-1155 multi-token standard, which enables the tokenization of other coins, even cryptos not on Ethereum. Its staking mechanism invites investors to stake their meme coins and, by holding STARS, earn extra rewards. The more STARS tokens a user holds, the greater rewards they’ll receive for staking other coins. STARS will have a capped supply of 42.069 billion, with 20% going to its presale and 20% to staking. Investors can join the STARS sale by going to the official Crypto All-Stars website , where they can buy it at a price of $0.0016648. Its sale will end in 17 days, so newcomers don’t have that much time to get involved. But if they do act quickly, they may end up making a sizeable return, since STARS is shaping up to be one of the biggest launches of the year.

37176613,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622115,1733243966,"MARA acquires Wind Farm, plans to convert underused sustainable resources into economic value","MARA has officially agreed to buy a wind farm in Hansford County, Texas. The farm has 114 MW of nameplate wind power and 240 MW of interconnection capacity. This happened after the Texas utility regulator tightened rules for Bitcoin miners using the (ERCOT) grid. According to MARA, the acquisition is intended to be a significant step forward in the organization’s strategies to fulfill its goals of converting underused sustainable resources into economic value, achieving near-zero energy costs, and enabling wider deployment of renewable energy. Salman Khan, MARA’s chief financial officer, said, “The program is expected to not only extend the life of the miners beyond their previous economic lives with zero-marginal energy cost but also enhance MARA’s return on capital employed while reducing our operating costs and mitigating shareholder dilution.” MARA’s windfarm initiative The startup intends to build and run a behind-the-meter data center powered exclusively by the site’s wind potential at no marginal energy cost. The facility will carry out MARA’s Advanced ASIC Retirement Initiative, which repurposes last-generation mining hardware that would otherwise be scrapped. This acquisition aims to turn unused sustainable resources into commercial value while lowering Bitcoin production costs through vertical integration. It is expected to be finalized in the first quarter of 2025. Fred Thiel, MARA’s Chairman and CEO, said, “This acquisition serves as a blueprint for how the energy and data center sectors can collaborate to create long-term value while advancing sustainability initiatives.” He added, “By repurposing machines and energizing them with 100% renewable, zero-marginal energy cost, we’re leveraging renewable resources that would have otherwise been curtailed, reducing our bitcoin production costs through vertical integration, and demonstrating MARA’s commitment to environmental stewardship.” The wind farm is the latest addition to MARA’s growing network of data centers driven by renewable energy sources. It will be a key part of the company’s efforts to be more environmentally friendly. MARA plans to take wind demand off the grid, which will make the grid less crowded, encourage the growth of green energy, and increase the area’s power demand. However, the deal can only go through if certain conditions are met, such as getting governmental approvals. MARA’s windfarm additional value to the crypto entity The Advanced ASIC Retirement Initiative is a creative way to solve an essential issue in the industry. By using old mining tools with free renewable energy, MARA might be able to turn assets that have lost value into businesses that make money. This method solves two problems. One is that it extends the lifecycle of ASICs past the normal retirement age. The other is that it will lower running costs by using renewable energy. In addition, the approach could make capital use much more efficient by getting the most out of investments in existing hardware while buying as little new equipment as possible. During market downturns, buying newer equipment might not be as cost-effective, but this model could become even more useful. With a zero-marginal energy cost structure, the business could stay profitable even when bitcoin prices are low. Why Texas? The Pro-Crypto Senator Ted Cruz of Texas promised to make his state a place where Bitcoin and other crypto can thrive. In terms of digital assets, he said that miners and people with new ideas from all over the world were coming to Texas to invest and get work. Cruz said in an interview on November 21 that the major threat to Bitcoin comes from the federal government and leaders who have made it clear that they don’t like digital assets. What’s more? He said that the federal government hates Bitcoin because it’s not controlled by one group. He said, “I want it out of government control; I don’t want federal bureaucrats having control over it.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/mara-acquires-wind-farm-plans-to-convert-underused-sustainable-resources-into-economic-value/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37176613.jpeg

The large traders transferred over $163 million in USDT to Upbit within an hour of President Yoon Suuk Yeol declaring emergency martial law, according to data tracked by blockchain sleuth Lookonchain. The president accused the opposition of siding with North Korea and undermining the nation’s constitutional order.   USDT, the world's leading dollar-pegged stablecoin, is commonly used for cryptocurrency purchases. The influx hints at a wave of bargain-hunting among traders.

37177092,https://cryptonews.com/?p=315802,1733243613,Cardano TVL Blasts to New Record High – Will ADA Become 2024’s Top Altcoin?,"The total value of crypto locked (TVL) in smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain just surpassed $700 million according to DeFi Llama, a new record high. The Cardano price has seen a massive surge since pro-crypto Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election, which also saw pro-crypto Republicans win a majority in both houses of Congress. ADA was last around $1.21, up roughly 4x versus its pre-US election levels in the low $0.30 area. Crypto investors are piling into the token amid bets that its ecosystem will boom under a pro-Trump administration in the US over the next four years. Notably for Cardano, the current SEC chair Gary Gensler , widely viewed as an enemy of the crypto industry, will step down in January. His agency had sued US crypto firms claiming that the token they sold, including ADA, were unregistered securities. Cardano’s co-founder Charles Hoskinson , meanwhile, is touted as a potential crypto advisor to the Trump admin. So, with TVL at record highs and the ADA price at its highest since early 2022, is Cardano shaping up to be 2024’s top altcoin ? Will ADA Become 2024’s Top Altcoin? Cardano, alongside XRP (XRP) has certainly been one of the best altcoins since Trump’s US presidential election. But its 104% year-to-date gain only ranks it as the 12th best performer in 2024 out of the top 20 coins by market cap. Coins like Sui (SUI), Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP (XRP) , by contrast, are each up over 300% since the start of 2024. So Cardano would have to at least 2x from current levels to finish the year as the “top” top 20 altcoins of the year. But comparing altcoins like this isn’t the most constructive way to think about things in crypto during a bull market. A better question to ask is this – will ADA perform strongly in 2025? The answer is yes (probably). Bitcoin dominance is currently breaking down, and altcoin markets are heating up, suggesting a new alt-season is here. And Cardano has plenty of highly bullish narratives, including that it is now marketing itself as Bitcoin’s DeFi chain, which could feed hype and excitement going into 2025. Lark Davis recently argued that it could surge a further 10x from current levels. Cardano Alternative to Consider Cardano is a strong candidate for best crypto to buy now given the prospect of massive further gains in 2025 and beyond. But some experienced crypto investors will be hunting for much lower market cap gems that might be able to deliver much greater upside over a short-term time period. One of the best ways to get into a low market cap gem before it starts really trending is via investing in high-potential presales. Analysts at cryptonews.com maintain a list of their top presale picks each month. One in particular that really stands out this December is Best Wallet (BEST) . Best Wallet is a new crypto wallet that comes packed with dozens of useful and exciting features such as crypto trading, portfolio management, staking, a debit card and a presale aggregator, as well as typical tools such as conducting crypto transactions and browsing web3. The exciting new project has already raised more than $2 million, despite only launching its fundraising efforts barely a few weeks ago.

The decision, which claimed to be aimed at preserving constitutional order, led to political chaos, widespread protests and a sharp decline in South Korean financial assets. Following the development, many assets, including Bitcoin, experienced serious declines on Upbit, the country's largest cryptocurrency exchange. The BTC price fell to around $71,000. Chart showing Bitcoin price volatility on Upbit. In an emergency speech from the Yongsan Presidential Palace in Seoul, President Yoon cited the actions of opposition forces in the National Assembly as a threat to the country’s stability. “By imposing emergency martial law, I will rebuild and defend the free Republic of Korea to prevent the nation from entering the path of destruction,” Yoon said. He vowed to “eliminate anti-state forces” that he claimed were undermining South Korea’s democratic system. The announcement sparked a backlash from opposition leaders, with former President Moon Jae-in issuing a strong statement condemning the declaration of martial law. “South Korean democracy is facing an unprecedented crisis,” Moon said in a social media post. The former president called on the National Assembly to take immediate action and called on citizens to unite to defend democratic values. Related News: JUST IN: Coinbase Announces It Will List an Altcoin in Futures Following Yoon’s statement, opposition lawmakers clashed with police outside the National Assembly building, escalating tensions in the capital. Amid the mounting pressure, South Korea’s National Assembly held an emergency session early on December 4, voting on a motion calling for martial law to be lifted. Of the 190 lawmakers present at the session, 170 voted in favor of the motion, effectively nullifying Yoon's order. National Assembly Speaker Woo Won-sik declared the emergency martial law “null and void.” The declaration of martial law has raised concerns about South Korea’s political and economic stability. While President Yoon has assured that the country’s foreign policy and international commitments will not change, his rhetoric about purging “anti-national forces” has raised concerns at home and abroad. *This is not investment advice.

South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol noted that he declared “emergency martial law” in response to the threats posed by North Korea’s communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements as per a CNBC live YouTube video. The president also noted attempts by the country’s Democratic Party to impeach government officials. “This is an unavoidable measure to ensure the freedom and safety of the people and guarantee the sustainability of the nation against the unrest stirred by these subversive, anti-state elements,” said Yoon. Major Tokens Drop The negative sentiment was instantly reflected in the crypto markets . Bitcoin, XRP, the two of the most traded tokens by volumes on local exchanges, plunged as low as 30% on Upbit before quickly recovering. BTC fell from $96,000 to $63,000 in U.S. dollar terms. Priced in South Korean won, Bitcoin’s value fell as low as ₩88,266,000 on Upbit, plunging down 33% from ₩132,429,000 in less than 30 minutes. Since then, Bitcoin’s price has slightly recovered on Upbit, valued around ₩127,000,000 worth—about $88,600 as of this writing. “Through this martial law, I will rebuild and protect the free Republic of Korea, which is falling into the depths of national ruin… I will eliminate anti-state forces as quickly as possible and normalise the country,” he said , while requesting the public to tolerate “some inconveniences”. Major crypto tokens quickly plunged as much as 30% against the Korean won on South Korean exchanges as the government declared emergency martial law. Notably, Bitcoin’s steep drop sent altcoins tumbling, with Ethereum sliding 35 percent and Ripple plummeting 51 percent. Domestic cryptocurrency exchanges Upbit and Bithumb also saw temporary connection disruptions. XRP Trading Volume Surges On Upbit XRP’s trading volume on South Korea’s leading crypto exchange, Upbit, has surged to $7 billion. The XRP/KRW trading pair accounted for nearly 30% of Upbit’s total trading volume today. Analysts suggest that the activity largely comprised sell orders as the broader crypto market faced significant pressure. This volume has even surpassed the total trading volume of the KOSPI, the country’s primary stock market index, raising speculations on the XRP price crashing below $2 amidst unexpected political developments. The South Korean won’s exchange rate to the U.S. dollar also fell by nearly 3% following the announcement. What is Martial Law In Korea? Martial law is the replacement of civilian government by military rule, and the suspension of civilian legal processes for military ones. Standard civil liberties may be suspended for as long as martial law continues. Why South Korea declared Martial Law? South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Tuesday declared martial law in an unannounced late night address broadcast live on YTN television, claiming that he would eradicate “shameless pro-North Korean anti-state forces.” He noted that through this martial law, he would rebuild and protect the free Republic of Korea, which is falling into the depths of national ruin by eliminating anti-state forces as quickly as possible and normalise the country.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-crashes-down-30-on-upbit-as-president-declares-martial-law/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Bitcoin ( BTC ) price dropped to 88,197,000 KRW, its lowest level since October 5, before rebounding to 132,000,000 KRW. The cryptocurrency was down by almost 40% from its highest level this year.

Similarly, Ripple ( XRP ), Stellar Lumens, and Solana ( SOL ) were down by double digits. Bitcoin price fell and then rebounded in South Korea | source: crypto.news The crash followed a political crisis in South Korea, which pushed the South Korean won to a record low. The won has become one of the worst-performing Asian currencies, dropping over 13% this year. You might also like: Missed the XRP price surge? 3 old-school crypto to consider The turmoil was triggered by President Yoon Suk Yeol’s decision to declare emergency martial law. He attributed the move to the opposition party, accusing it of ties to North Korea. Yoon said : “I declare martial law to protect the free Republic of Korea from the threat of North Korean communist forces, to eradicate the despicable pro-North Korean anti-state forces that are plundering the freedom and happiness of our people, and to protect the free constitutional order.” Therefore, Bitcoin and other altcoins plunged as many investors rushed to liquidate their assets as the political crisis escalated. In most periods, investors are often driven in fear when a major event happens. For instance, similar sell-offs occurred at the onset of the war in Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by rebounds as investors adjusted to the new circumstances. This pattern likely explains the recovery seen in BTC and altcoins after their initial plunge. Additionally, cryptocurrencies maintain strong fundamentals, with regulatory developments expected to improve in the United States.

37177091,https://cryptonews.com/?p=315603,1733242272,"Best Crypto to Buy Now December 3 – Ondo Finance, JasmyCoin, Chainlink","November marked a significant turning point in the cryptocurrency market, with monthly exchange volumes reaching a three-year high of $2.9 trillion and traders searching for the best crypto to buy now. This surge followed Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential election victory, which fueled hopes of pro-crypto regulatory changes. However, Bitcoin’s struggle to break the $100,000 barrier, despite a 38% monthly gain, has kept investors cautious. Amid this consolidation, altcoins like Ondo Finance (ONDO), JasmyCoin (JASMY), and Chainlink (LINK) are gaining traction as some of the best crypto to buy in the current market. Ondo Finance (ONDO): Price Rally and Technical Indicators Suggest Momentum Ondo Finance has quickly risen as a notable project in decentralized finance (DeFi), offering tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) and fixed-yield loans. Its recent price rally of 44.88% between December 2 and 3 pushed ONDO to a new all-time high of $1.80 before stabilizing at $1.69. Source: CoinMarketCap / ONDO Technical analysis highlights a robust upward trend, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading at 85, signaling overbought conditions. Open interest in ONDO futures has surged, rising from $185.45 million to $304.53 million, indicating growing market confidence . If momentum persists, ONDO may approach the $2 mark , though traders should remain cautious about potential pullbacks given its strong rally. JasmyCoin (JASMY): Fibonacci Levels and Bullish Patterns Drive Gains JasmyCoin, often called “Japan’s Bitcoin,” has shown strong bullish momentum backed by technical patterns. The token surged 40.5% in the last 24 hours to $0.4068 , building on a broader uptrend that began on November 5 and saw a 145% increase in its value. Source: CoinMarketCap / JASMY The price action has formed a rounding bottom reversal pattern, a classic indicator of sustained upward movement. JasmyCoin is currently trading near the 100% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.04077, with upside targets at $0.0522 and $0.0717. Off of the retest, $JASMY (JasmyCoin) begins another scaling of price and this time around, in a much more powerful market, this scaling can be COLOSSAL !

Recent price action includes an intraday gain of 26.14% , supported by technical indicators signaling sustained buying interest.

Better Alternatives and Market Outlook The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a renewed wave of optimism, partly driven by increasing institutional participation. MicroStrategy recently purchased 15,400 Bitcoin for approximately $1.5 billion, bringing its total holdings to 402,100 BTC. Similarly, Genius Group has advanced its “Bitcoin-first” strategy by acquiring 172 BTC for $1.8 million , aiming to allocate 90% of its reserves to Bitcoin. These high-profile moves underscore the growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value, even as its price consolidates below $100,000. At the same time, the altcoin market is gaining prominence as up-and-coming projects and presale tokens attract investors seeking high-growth opportunities.

Here's How Many BTCs Are Under Management by the Company!,"BlackRock’s IBIT Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) has reached a major milestone by surpassing 500,000 BTC (approximately $48 billion) in assets under management (AUM). BlackRock's Spot Bitcoin ETF Surpasses 500,000 BTC in AUM This achievement comes less than a year after its debut on January 11, making it one of the fastest-growing ETFs in history. According to the fund’s latest disclosures, IBIT held 496,854 BTC as of Nov. 29. According to K33 data, single-day net inflows of $338.3 million (about 3,526 BTC) on Monday brought its total assets to 500,380 BTC. “This is unprecedented growth,” said Vetle Lunde, Head of Research at K33. “BlackRock’s IBIT has accumulated more than 500,000 BTC in just 233 trading days.” Ian Unsworth, co-founder of Kairos Research, highlighted that IBIT’s holdings currently represent 2.38% of Bitcoin’s total supply, underlining its importance in the market. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink previously described IBIT as “the fastest-growing ETF in the history of ETFs” during an interview in March, when the fund surpassed 250,000 BTC. Since then, Bitcoin’s price has increased by 38% and is currently trading around $95,000. US Bitcoin ETFs Are Closing in on Satoshi's Assets U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively attracted net inflows of $353.6 million on Monday, adding to a record $6.6 billion in inflows through November.

It dropped to a low of around $61,500 (its equivalent in Korean Won) and immediately recovered. Source: TradingView As you can see in the 1-minute chart above, the whole fiasco took less than 15 minutes, during which time Bitcoin’s price crashed to 88,260,000 KRW. This represented a decrease of around 30%, realized in less than a few minutes. Almost immediately after that, the cryptocurrency recovered. The primary reason for this price action seems to be the announcement that South Korea’s president, Yoon Suk Yeol, declared martial law during his speech in Seoul just a few moments ago. The political turmoil in the country has caused market unrest, resulting in considerable volatility across the board. Meanwhile, Bitcoin trades at around $95,500 across most global exchanges, down 1.6% for the day.

She made this audacious comparison to urge XRP investors to hold onto their positions for the long term. Jones emphasized that XRP, the digital asset Ripple uses for cross-border payments , is far more than just a speculative token or “meme coin.” “XRP is not a meme coin,” Jones tweeted , “XRP is not a regular crypto.” In this context, the financial analyst warned investors that selling XRP now is like parting with Berkshire Hathaway shares in the company’s early days. “All you have to have is patience,"" Jones said.Her comments come as XRP has experienced significant volatility over the years, often caught in the crossfire of regulatory battles and fluctuating market sentiment. However, sentiment around XRP is improving . The token is currently trading at $2.73, up 450% in the past 30 days. This price places XRP just 29% below its all-time high.Jones believes that XRP’s unique use case, specifically its role in cross-border payments, positions it for even greater long-term success, much like Berkshire Hathaway's value became apparent only after years of growth and development.XRP Like Berkshire Hathaway’s SharesNotably, Berkshire Hathaway is one of the most successful investment firms in history, led by renowned investor Warren Buffett, the company's chairman and CEO. While many early investors did not recognize its long-term value, those who held onto their shares have seen substantial returns.According to market data from TradingView, Berkshire Hathaway's Class A shares (BRK.A) boast an all-time return of 292,100% from their current position.Essentially, the Wall Street analyst suggests that those who choose to hold onto XRP now could find themselves in a similar position when the asset's true value is realized.Notably, the audacious comparison of XRP to shares of successful companies has been a recurring theme in the crypto scene. Other market commentators have also compared XRP to shares of the FANG companies. Some have used this analogy to argue for an 8,000% price surge for XRP into the future.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/03/wall-street-analyst-says-selling-xrp-now-is-like-selling-shares-of-berkshire-hathaway-in-early-days/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wall-street-analyst-says-selling-xrp-now-is-like-selling-shares-of-berkshire-hathaway-in-early-days,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Elon’s Billions (ELONBILL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONBILL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Billions can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Billions could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Billions launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Billions on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Billions by entering its contract address – 5VkZGZPArjvA7aDTMVenePmqW62rRZtugUPqC8kEXaez – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONBILL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/elons-billions-elonbill-memecoin-will-explode-over-17000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37175740,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622093,1733241703,The $BERT Revolution: A Dog’s Journey to Crypto Stardom and a Worldwide Movement,"Bertram the Pomeranian ($BERT) captured the masses’ attention with his cute face that radiated love and innocent yet sassy charm, making him insanely popular in the crypto space. The dog influencer who was the inspiration behind the memecoin $BERT is sadly no more. The report came last week that the adorable puppy had died in his sleep, in what his owner, Kathy Grayson, defined as a “sudden and shocking” moment. “We’ve been together almost every second of every day for more than 11 years,” she told the media. Adopted from Petfinder after his breeders abandoned him, Bert was more than just a dog for Kathy, he was her family, her light, and inspiration. Over the years, the 11-year-old Pomeranian had accumulated a strong following on social media. Besides having 400,000 followers on Instagram, he even appeared in a Netflix movie and did photoshoots for luxury brands. The Paddington Bear look-alike was recently part of the fun competition for the Honorary NYC Dog Mayor Election of 2024 when it caught the eye of the crypto community, which rallied behind the pooch and began marketing for the dog on social media, urging people to vote for Bert. This resulted in a flood of votes for Bertie, with the dog winning by about 96% and the election participants calling out “election fraud.” NYTimes reported Bert’s total votes rising to over 4,000, a sharp increase from about 1,000 votes it received in the first round. “It was really cuckoo with people alleging election fraud — in a dog election,” said Kathy. In her latest statement, Bert’s proud mom said the crypto community’s support was simply from “passionate individuals” showing their love for the dog. Eventually, Bert conceded, and another dog won while Bert became the deputy mayor. But it was earlier this month and now Bertie is no more. His memory, however, is alive with the memecoin. As the official website of this Solana-based memecoin states , “Abandoned by breeders, adopted and crowned by the people.” The community behind the $BERT memecoin is now focusing on turning this heartbreak into a global movement for good. And that is what “gives me hope is the incredible movement that has formed in his name,” said Kathy. From Pomeranian to Powerhouse: $BERT Inspiring the World These past two months, Bert has gone from being a beloved pet to inspiring one of the most remarkable memecoins. Launched at the beginning of October, $BERT started at a price point under $0.0001. At that time, its market cap hovered between a range of $500K and $5 million. That was up until November 13 when the value of the memecoin representing the pomeranian suddenly ripped up. The memecoin recorded a whopping 60x increase in its value as it went from almost $0.003 to $0.180, according to DEXTools . In a matter of just 48 hours, its market cap jumped over 125%, going from less than $1.4 million to $180 million, with tens of thousands of holders joining in to make it one of the most traded tokens on Phantom, Solana’s most popular wallet. Meanwhile, on the centralized exchange (CEX) MEXC , the $BERT price made an all-time high (ATH) at $0.218. Since then, the price has declined significantly, hitting about $0.040 on Nov. 21st. However, volatility is part of the course in the crypto sector, more so for memecoins, which are known for their heightened fluctuations. As of writing, the $54 million market cap $BERT is trading at $0.059 while managing $8.274 million in 24-hour trading volume. At This shows continued interest from investors in $BERT, as memecoins lead the crypto bull market narrative, which has also begun gaining traction among CEXs like Coinbase, Robinhood, Kraken, and Binance, as they start listing memecoins to capitalize on this trend. $BERT’s community is already growing steadily and strongly, with 25.46K holders now investing in $BERT, which has a total supply of just 980 million, all of which is circulating in the market. On the utility side, you can now spend $BERT in 136 countries with the new Zebec Silver Card. It’s super easy to use, works with Apple Pay and Google Pay, and there’s no cost to get started—no issuance fees, no KYC. On top of that, 1% of every $BERT transaction goes straight to dog shelter charities, so every time you spend, you’re helping dogs in need. So, the community-powered $BERT memecoin isn’t only about speculation, though. It is actually on a mission to help dogs worldwide, which holds even more significance in the aftermath of Bert’s departure from this world. The $BERT community is actively engaged in charity contributions to dog shelters, helping provide food, care, and resources. They have committed an initial $100K grant for the cause. Bert’s owner, Kathy, who now owns 1% of the $BERT supply that was originally granted to the dog, has also “pledged to hold” and use portions of it to help dogs in need worldwide, in Bert’s honor. A statue of Bert has also been commissioned in his memory. To further take the movement forward, the project has launched a $BERT-powered AI-driven platform called Woofhub that connects dogs in need with loving homes through real-time adoption alerts. At the same time, the project is raising awareness for shelters. Recently, BERT also introduced the WOOFhub Dog Collar , a new way to make life easier and safer for dogs and their owners. It comes with QR codes and NFC chips that connect to custom dog profiles on woofhub.com, so if a dog ever gets lost, reuniting them with their owner is quick and simple. The collar also has lights to keep dogs visible at night and can be personalized to match every pup’s unique vibe. It’s practical, thoughtful, and just the beginning of what WOOFhub is working on. This is all just the beginning, $BERT plans to further expand its tools and foster new partnerships to build a brighter future for our furry friends and have a much larger impact on the crypto ecosystem and the world.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX | BNB,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-bert-revolution-a-dogs-journey-to-crypto-stardom-and-a-worldwide-movement/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37175740.jpeg

Similarly, analysts suggest that the Dogecoin price has entered a bull phase that could increase the altcoin’s price in the coming months. However, while the Dogecoin price rise is something investors are excited about, a new altcoin, RCO Finance, is grabbing investor attention as an AI trading platform. Similarly, analysts have predicted that RCO Finance’s potential could be similar to the Dogecoin price surge in 2021. Dogecoin Price: Is the First Bull Phase Complete? Currently, the Dogecoin price is trading at $0.4311, a 1.3% jump in the last day. Crypto analyst KrissPax, in an X post, has revealed that Dogecoin price has completed the first part of its bull phase, mirroring the 2021 and 2017 bull runs. The analyst notes the previous cycles recorded additional up-phases with high percentage gains in the Dogecoin price. Consequently, the altcoin could record two more up-phases before reaching a high price in this market cycle. Another crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, pointed out how Dogecoin price would test investors’ patience in this parabolic run, as the TD sequential points to a sell signal. This could lead to a brief correction before the bull rally continues. Like the Dogecoin price rise in 2021, RCO Finance is on the verge of a high growth potential. Its presale is already gathering attention as whales flock, anticipating that the altcoin could deliver life-changing returns for early investors. RCO Finance: Groundbreaking AI-Powered DeFi Platform While the Dogecoin price 2021 captivated many investors, the altcoin’s passionate community and social media hype mainly drove the growth. Investors seek the next big opportunity to mirror such explosive growth as the cryptocurrency market matures. RCO Finance is a groundbreaking AI-powered DeFi platform quietly revolutionizing blockchain technology. At the heart of RCO Finance is the AI-powered robo-advisor tool that tailors investment strategies to fit individual user profiles. Unlike traditional advisors, which can be costly and require extensive market research, the robo-advisor simplifies the trading process. Unlike Dogecoin, which thrives on social media hype, RCO Finance combines AI technology with real utility. Thus, traders can maximize profits while minimizing risks. Also, the AI robo-advisor tool provides personalized investment advice, eliminating emotional trading and helping users make smarter choices without human error. Imagine never monitoring the market changes! That is how the AI robo advisor helps investors while adjusting investments automatically. This makes it easier for new investors without experience in monitoring markets and saves time for experienced traders. Again, RCO Finance offers traders a unique opportunity by tokenizing real-world assets like real estate. This altcoin allows more investors to invest in fractions of high-value investment opportunities. Consequently, this adds more flexibility as investors can easily diversify their portfolios. Finally, RCO Finance takes security very seriously. The altcoin’s smart contract is audited by a top security firm, SolidProof, confirming that it’s a safe investment platform. RCO Finance Presale: Limited Opportunity for Explosive Gains Experts predict that RCO Finance is on track for explosive growth to mirror the Dogecoin price surge of 2021. Consequently, the RCOF presale phase generates excitement as whales flock to this altcoin. RCO Finance is a great opportunity for early investors to gain high growth potential. The altcoin is in its fourth stage, with the RCOF tokens priced at just $0.077. Analysts have predicted that the price could rise by 19,000% ROI. With an initial investment of $1,000 today, your investment will be worth $190,000 when the altcoin reaches the target price. Be a part of this revolution by joining the RCO Finance presale today.

37175949,https://blockworks.co/news/tokens-new-era-crypto-regulation,1733241600,Tokens in SEC’s ‘crosshairs’ could benefit from new era: Kaiko,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . XRP’s up 120% in the past week. It’s also seen a “stark uptick” in volatility, according to Kaiko analysts. Realized volume is up over 100%, marking its newest high since July 2023 (in case you need a refresher, that’s when the court ruling about institutional sales was filed). And here’s something interesting: XRP’s move over the weekend actually eclipsed bitcoin volumes. “Seeing stronger volumes accompany a move higher in prices implies that the move has a broad base and is less likely to be just a fleeting change,” analysts wrote. For Kaiko, these data sets suggest that tokens that had previously been in the SEC’s line of fire could see some reprieve — and a potential jump — as the SEC enters into a new era. One in which the market feels pretty comfortable betting that the agency won’t take as much offense to crypto’s existence, though we don’t know who will be handpicked by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the new regime. My colleague, Fox’s Eleanor Terrett, thinks there’s a possibility that we could have a name as soon as today. 🚨NEW: @realDonaldTrump ’s pick to replace @GaryGensler as @SECGov Chair could be announced as soon as tomorrow, sources tell @FoxBusiness . Stay tuned 📺. — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) December 3, 2024 Dragonfly’s Haseeb Qureshi, on the Empire podcast this morning , had an interesting read-through about the interest in XRP and how that translates into this broader cycle — because, surprise, I always like to find an excuse to zoom out. Basically, he thinks this is a sign that folks aren’t just here for the memes. “Most people don’t want to do this nihilistic thing of ‘I’m just betting that this thing is going to go up and down’ because they don’t actually think they’re gambling. They think that they are investing in the future,” Qureshi said. Don’t get me wrong, David and I know there’s an appetite for the memes , but I think Qureshi’s point is a salient one: Those who are new in crypto or who have been in crypto have heard talking heads, analysts, even Trump, say that there’s valuable technology in this space and that’s why they’re here. Memes just happen to make it fun…for those who want to partake. I’m with Qureshi here, and WisdomTree’s Jason Guthrie (which, funny enough, filed for an XRP ETF just yesterday). Let the memes pump but don’t let them overshadow the fact that more concrete interest is on the rise — and change is on the horizon.

At the same time he also took a slight dig at Sam Bankman-Fried, the former FTX CEO whose actions led to the collapse of the exchange and the wiped out billions in user funds. Buterin portrays Sam Bankman-Fried as the ultimate choice for crypto villains, highlighting their actions that put users’ funds at risk. Buterin believes that wallets are the window between a user and the Ethereum world , and a user only benefits from any decentralization, censorship resistance, security, privacy, or other properties that Ethereum and its applications offer to the extent that the wallet itself also has these properties. Emphasis Placed on Privacy And Security While he noted that there has been a lot of progress on improving user experience, security and functionality of Ethereum wallets, this post, particularly focuses on the ideal properties of an ideal Ethereum wallet, emphasizing security and privacy. While Security lies at the forefront of his vision, he advocates for social recovery mechanisms using multi-signature wallets. He noted that a good wallet should simultaneously be good in two areas: protect users from hacking or malicious activities by the wallet developer and from their own mistakes. His preferred solution to this has been social recovery and multisig wallets, with graded access control. He noted that more complicated guardian architectures, such as having multiple timelock durations at different thresholds, can help maximize the chance of successful legitimate account recovery while at the same time minimizing the risk of theft. But who or what should the guardians be? Experienced crypto users can use friends and family’s keys to create a fresh address, eliminating the risk of collusion. However, he also noted that this option is not available for most new users. A second option he noted was institutional guardians, that is firms that only sign transactions if they receive confirmation of the request, such as a confirmation code or video call for high-value users. However, these services have been attempted for a long time, but have not been successful thus far. Multiple personal devices can be challenging for inexperienced users and risky for theft or loss. Passkeys, backed up on devices or in the cloud, provide a hybrid of password security and hardware assumptions. While passkeys are valuable, they alone aren’t strong enough to protect life savings. ZK-SNARKs offer an option for converting centralized IDs like zk-email, Anon Aadhaar, and Myna Wallet into Ethereum addresses. These addresses can only be used for transactions if a ZK-SNARK proves ownership of the centralized ID. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : South Korea Martial Law Triggers Crypto Market Crash : Bitcoin and Altcoins Plunge , Privacy, an Everyday Feature He places emphasis on privacy as an everyday feature rather than an afterthought.

37175575,https://nulltx.com/?p=135151,1733241448,"RIPPLE PRICE ANALYSIS & PREDICTION (December 3) – XRP Rallies Near ATH Following A Staggering 500% Gains In A Month, Incoming Break Up?","Bouncing back from a three-day pullback late last month, XRP resumed buying and rallied by over 100% to near its all-time high. Facing a slight rejection, it appears indecisive while remaining strongly bullish. The past week saw XRP through another stunning rally as it doubled its price to hit a new multi-year high of $2.9 yesterday – an inch away from its all-time high – ATH. That level was rejected and the price retraced slightly to where it is changing hands at $2.73 at the time of writing. Currently, the bulls are trying to reiterate action, but there’s not enough volume to sustain the momentum as trading remains calm on the day. Looking back from where the price picked up in November, XRP is up by 5x with no signs of cooling off the rally. It appears highly bullish daily, but from a technical standpoint, the asset appeared to have reached an extremely overbought condition on the weekly chart. This suggests an imminent drop, which will likely happen anytime soon. Though there’s still room for an increase. But when the price reaches an exhaustion point, we may see a deep correction before resuming bullish. Surpassing BNB, Solana (SOL) and Tether (USDT) in the last 48 hours of trading, XRP is the 3rd largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $155 billion at the time of writing. XRP’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview While the bulls are trying to sustain pressure, a daily candle close above yesterday’s $2.9 high should bring a full recovery to the current ATH of $3.3 before rallying hard to $3.7 and $4. Failure to push above the previous daily high could result in a retest of the flipped $1.9 high as support. Lower support levels to consider for a pullback are $1.63 and $1.28. Key Resistance Levels: $2.9, $3.3, $3.7 Key Support Levels: $1.97, $1.63, $1.28 Spot Price: $2.73 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase announced Mog Coin ( MOG ) as the latest addition to its listing roadmap , according to a tweet from the firm’s dedicated assets page on X. Coinbase stated it would list MOG on Base, the company’s Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, which has nearly $4 billion in user deposits or total value locked. MOG’s price surged 23% within an hour of the announcement, according to data from DEXScreener. The token’s market cap reached approximately $1 billion, making it the tenth-largest meme coin by valuation. https://twitter.com/CoinbaseAssets/status/1863953923372949771 You might also like: Coinbase adds Apple Pay to onramp for easier crypto access Coinbase’s meme coin listing spree has included a basket of top tokens from the speculative sector.

The digital asset titan might also list viral meme coin Peanut The Squirrel ( PNUT ). As crypto.news reported, PNUT featured on the company’s Apple Pay tutorial, raising suspicious about a possible listing in the coming days. Integrating Apple Pay will also provide wider crypto access, which may direct bigger liquidity toward meme coins like MOG and MOODENG. President Donald Trump’s re-election and expectations for looser crypto regulations may have influenced Coinbase’s recent decisions.

37175582,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622007,1733241398,"XRP Ledger cuts its reserve requirement from 10 to 1 XRP, favoring small new wallets","As the crypto market prepares for a new season of growth, XRP has opted to reduce its reserves 10 times lower. The current adjustment reflects a decrease to $2.64 from $26.40. This presents an opportunity for new network users to fund their wallets with a smaller amount of crypto, thereby attracting a larger user base. The modification was applied to XRP Labs nodes on October 16. However, adjusting the reserve requirement required a validator reset and a consensus vote from all validators, which only took place yesterday. Developers have said that the high reserve of 10 XRP has slowed down the network’s uptake, which was not why they made it high. They explained that the high reserve was meant to keep the record from getting too big for the nodes to store. They also wanted to stop people from making fake accounts with little to no XRP, so they made the 10 XRP reserve minimum. 1 XRP instead of 10 XRP – The details On December 2, blockchain data shows that XRP Ledger cut the base reserve needs from 10 XRP to just 1 XRP. This allows new network users to fund their wallets with less crypto, which could make it easier for more people to join. It also lets people spend some XRP that they would have had to save up before. XRP account reserve requirements | Source : LiveNet The ledger developer WietseWind said, “The number one concern would be increased activity on the ledger to the point where it becomes a challenge for infrastructure.” He said that it was a good problem that they could handle. He also claimed that engineers would develop means to accommodate the extra strain on the network and could manage it. The change happened on 2nd December on the XRP ledger website. An XRP holder showed in an X post that owner reserves had gone down from 2 XRP ($5.12) to 0.2 XRP ($0.51). This means that users only need to hold on to 0.2 XRP for each item they own. XRP Ledger papers say that objects can be trust lines, signer lists, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or owner directories. Some oracles are also things that need to be reserved by their owners. XRP prepares for a seamless flight For a long time, Ripple Labs, the development team behind XRP, has conflicted with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ripple denies that XRP is a security and that the SEC should have registered it, but the SEC maintains that it is. Ripple is appealing the decision that penalized them $125 million in the lawsuit. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghose said that XRP would have done better than Bitcoin if it had not been for the SEC’s distractions. Paul Atkins, the most highly anticipated SEC candidate, is one that crypto entities believe would give them an easy time. The decision to cut reserve requirements comes at a time when the XRP Ledger native coin is experiencing significant growth. Before Donald Trump was elected US president, XRP was worth less than a cent per coin. However, since the election, it has increased to $2.65, jumping 435% in 30 days to reach its highest level since February 2018. Large holders are significantly influencing this move. According to on-chain data, XRP has gone up 14% in the last 24 hours, doing better than Bitcoin and all the other big cryptos. Over the weekend, the token quickly beat Solana’s SOL and tether (USDT), and as of Tuesday, it was the third-largest token by market cap. In addition, XRP trading volume has also been reported to have hit $3.7 billion on the South Korean crypto Exchange – Upbit. Trading volumes of XRP tokens against the Korean won hit $3.7 billion on Upbit in the last 24 hours. With Trump entering office in 2025, Ripple will be more eligible to compete with other crypto companies without any distractions. Kain Warwick asserted that the crypto space has a four-year window to expand to a scale that makes it resistant to anyone shutting it down.

37175490,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373215,1733241358,Here’s Why CryptoQuant CEO Says This Altseason Won’t Play Out as Expected,"The altcoin market is currently on a roll, with several cryptocurrencies skyrocketing to multi-year highs, but Ki Young Ju, the founder and CEO of blockchain analytics platform CryptoQuant, believes this altseason will not play out as traders and investors expected. In an X post, Ju insisted that this altcoin season will be “weird and challenging” because only a few chosen assets will record significant gains and “win the game.” According to the CryptoQuant founder, the altcoin market sentiment is good, but the sector is not seeing a notable inflow of fresh liquidity, and this could hamper the growth of most crypto assets. Altseason to Play Out Differently The altseason refers to when capital flows from bitcoin (BTC) to other cryptocurrencies. During this time, BTC retraces its steps and consolidates within a particular range, its dominance and market share declining, while altcoins skyrocket and possibly hit new highs. From Ju’s perspective, BTC is drifting away from the crypto ecosystem and developing its own paper-based layer-2 entity. The CryptoQuant CEO said this development is being pushed by Bitcoin spot and futures exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) and the stocks of Bitcoin-friendly companies like MicroStrategy (MSTR). Unfortunately, bridging from the paper-based L2 Bitcoin ecosystem to altcoins is impossible. Ju explained that altcoins used to move together due to their correlation with BTC; however, that pattern has broken, and only a handful of cryptocurrencies are showing independent traits because they are attracting new liquidity. “Alt season is no longer defined by asset rotation from #Bitcoin. The surge in altcoin trading volume isn’t driven by $BTC pairs but by stablecoin and fiat pairs, reflecting real market growth rather than asset rotation,” the crypto analyst clarified in a separate tweet . Following Bitcoin’s Path The CryptoQuant founder’s opinion is substantiated by altcoin market dynamics over the past 24 hours. While most large-cap altcoins have been in the red, others, like Ripple’s native token, XRP , and Chainlink ( LINK ), have skyrocketed to levels not seen in years. Meanwhile, Ju asserted that altcoins now have two options: build a real internet money ecosystem using stablecoins and BTC or create paper-wrapped versions like Bitcoin. He then suggested that altcoin investors find cryptocurrencies that can work on one of the two options and hold them long-term.

Starting in January 2025, it will only support stablecoins for all payment services. The company will stop supporting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) by December 2024. According to the announcement, dtcpay affirmed that this change is due to the high volatility of these cryptocurrencies. dtcpay Says Stablecoins is More Reliable Stablecoins are digital currencies tied to the value of stable assets, like the US dollar. They provide a more stable option compared to traditional cryptocurrencies. dtcpay focuses on these stablecoins to create a smoother and more reliable payment experience for users. Notably, this shift shows a growing trend in the fintech industry, where more people see stablecoins as a way to connect the volatile cryptocurrency market with everyday use. Meanwhile, the company will support stablecoins like First Digital USD (FDUSD) and Worldwide USD (WUSD), in addition to USDT and USDC. dtcpay will also continue supporting transactions in fiat currency, ensuring its services are open to everyone. The company’s focus on stablecoins matches global trends as more countries recognize and regulate stablecoins as valid options for digital payments. Wyoming to Launch Stablecoin Beyond dtcpay, the quest for stablecoins is growing across the globe. Recall that Wyoming is pushing for the next phase of its crypto sector growth. This time around, the state is looking at venturing into consumer payments. Wyoming plans to launch its United States dollar-pegged stablecoin as part of this new phase and has decided to name it Wyoming stable token. However, the stablecoin will launch officially in the first quarter of 2025. Wyoming hopes to offer individuals and businesses a faster and cheaper way to conduct transactions. Additionally, it serves as an extra source of revenue for the state. On a larger scale, Wyoming’s stable token will serve as a model for the future federal digital dollar. According to Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon, success for the state is equivalent to “the adoption of a stablecoin… that’s transparent, that is fully backed by our short-term Treasurys [and] that’s dollar dependent.” Paxos Floats New Stablecoin USDG in Singapore Similarly, Paxos, a blockchain giant, introduced its latest stablecoin, Global Dollar (USDG) in Singapore. USDG reflects Paxos’s mission to combine secure compliance with innovative digital finance solutions. Ronak Daya, Paxos’s Head of Product, stressed the need for a solution that combines regulatory compliance with real economic incentives for enterprises. He expressed that USDG is a strategic response to the demand of modern businesses. Paxos partnered with DBS, Singapore’s largest bank by assets , ensuring secured management of USDG reserves. DBS is responsible for cash and custody management and ensuring institutions and individuals trust USDG’s reliability.

FreeDum Fighters nears its presale end with 4 days left, $700k raised, and strong investor interest in PolitiFi tokens. Table of Contents PolitiFi tokens have huge impact on the crypto landscape More than a meme coin: political stakes are crypto’s killer app Join PolitiFi 2.0 with DUM FreeDum Fighters (DUM) is in the final innings of its presale with just four days left, having raised over $700k. As political-related cryptocurrencies continue to grab attention in 2024, FreeDum Fighters has seized the opportunity with the most unique project yet. Positioning itself as a PolitiFi leader beyond the U.S. election, FreeDum Fighters offers features that appeal to a broad user base. The project’s adoption is expected to rise as Trump takes office and ushers in a new era for cryptocurrencies. Trump’s inauguration in January makes political-focused cryptocurrencies an attractive opportunity for investors, and DUM is among the top picks. However, with the ICO ending in four days, there is limited time to attain this token at a fixed price of $0.000113. Don’t miss out – secure yours before it’s too late. PolitiFi tokens have huge impact on the crypto landscape The crypto market has changed dramatically in 2024, and the PolitiFi sector has been a big part of that. Tokens paying homage to political figures or events have risen and drawn hundreds of millions of dollars in investments. The hype around these tokens remains, with the PolitiFi sector seeing $287 million in 24-hour trading volume, reaching a $490 million market cap. Trump-themed token Patriot is a top gainer this week, pumping 36%. Meanwhile, Biden-themed Jeo Boden has posted an 11% gain. The ability of these tokens to create humor in an otherwise serious realm of society has been a big draw. Yet, no token has a balance of humor and politics quite like FreeDum Fighters, which seamlessly injects satirical narratives into innovative political utilities. The project introduces several captivating characters such as MAGATRON, Kamacop 9000, Dark MAGA (Elon Musk), Sleepy Joe. Through these entertaining characters, FreeDum Fighters cultivates a unique memetic-political synergy that positions it to lead the PolitiFi sector in 2025 and beyond. You might also like: MAGA-themed coin FreeDum Fighters raises over $500k in presale for PolitiFi 2.0 plans More than a meme coin: political stakes are crypto’s killer app Quite like the predictions market Polymarket, FreeDum Fighters offers users ways to engage with political events from the blockchain. Polymarket stands as crypto’s killer app in 2024, but FreeDum Fighters brings a twist. As mentioned, two of its characters are MAGATRON and Kamacop 9000. These are mechanized figureheads representing Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Both have a corresponding staking pool – Trump’s is FreeDum, and Harris’s is LibDum. Users can stake their tokens in their favorite and earn rewards. Right now, Trump has the lion’s share of tokens in his pool – even though Kamacop 9000 has a higher APY. Why? Because users are choosing to support who they think will carry the industry forward rather than fatter profits. Beyond staking pools, FreeDum Fighters runs weekly debates in which users can engage in political discourse, arguing for or against that week’s chosen topic. The winning side earns DUM rewards. FreeDum Fighters is a lot more than a political meme coin. It’s a hotbed preparing for a new era of political and crypto alignment. We’re likely to see countless new use cases and trends emerge from the platform, so it’s not one you want to miss. All of this is turning a lot of attention to the project, especially considering its exchange debut is just four days away. In a recent video, top crypto analyst Crypto June said it is “Going to explode like MAGA Trump.” Join PolitiFi 2.0 with DUM Investors can take advantage of this unique project by participating in its presale at the ground floor price. To buy DUM, visit the project’s presale website, connect your wallet, and choose the amount of DUM to buy and the crypto to pay with. Rest assured that the project is safe and secure.

The trend appears more bullish daily as it poises for a big price movement. Litecoin ended last month’s trading on a strong bullish note after staying indecisive for almost three months. This bullish move started with a key break above the $77 level and the price formed a higher high and higher low pattern daily. Breaking slightly above the important $100 level, a rejection occurred and the price dropped back. The bulls pushed back and managed to close that month above the mentioned level. Interestingly, volatility increased this month and the price broke out of the yearly high. As seen on the daily chart, the trend seemed to have completely shifted to the upside as it now looks highly bullish. Negative sentiments have faded away and as shown on the daily chart, there’s no sign of selling at the moment. Even though the sellers show up, it must drop below $50 before we can consider a bearish shift. While this breakout has signalled a long-term move, Litecoin looks more bullish daily as it sets for massive growth. It has been on a buying spree since the start of the month following a 30% surge. Bigger gains are underway! LTC’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Surging through the $140 level, the next target resistance level to watch for buying is $150. If they claim it, $160 would be the next resistance level to keep in mind. The recently flipped yearly $113 high is the closest support level to keep in mind for a pullback. Dropping below this level could bring a retest at the $106 and $98.5 supports – all flipped in the past week.

Veteran Analyst Reveals Possible Bullish Catalyst For This Spectacular Price Milestone,"Dan Gambardello, a veteran market analyst and founder of Crypto Capital Venture, is uber-bullish about Cardano (ADA). As one of the most outspoken advocates of ADA, he has forecasted that the coin could swiftly rocket to the ambitious $3 level. What Will It Take For ADA To Hit $3 Quickly? According to Dan Gambardello, Cardano presently has many positive developments within its ecosystem contributing to its latest upsurge. While he did not name the specific developments, Gambardello suggested that ADA could blast off to $3 if it secures bullish news about potential spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as XRP has done in recent times. In other words, he believes Cardano’s price could see an XRP-esque ballistic rally if asset managers file paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for ETFs offering traditional investors direct exposure to the ADA cryptocurrency. Such a development would broaden investors’ access to the cryptocurrency in America. Notably, XRP has been on a roll ever since Donald Trump defeated Democratic Presidential nominee Kamala Harris on Nov. 6. The crypto is up 402% over the past 30 days while Cardano’s ADA has posted a 260% rally during the same timeframe. XRP Beats ADA In Terms Of ETF Applications After the successful launch of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs on U.S. exchanges, crypto spectators projected that Ripple’s XRP, Solana, and ADA would likely be the next cryptocurrencies to land on Wall Street. Although a slew of companies have already submitted filings with the SEC to introduce ETFs tied to XRP and Solana, no ADA application has been made so far. The only interesting thing related to ADA that has landed on the SEC’s desk is NYSE Arca’s request to convert Bitwise’s $1.4 billion crypto index fund to an exchange-traded product. The Bitwise fund currently holds popular assets, including Bitcoin, Solana, XRP, Cardano, and Avalanche.

37177090,https://cryptonews.com/?p=315748,1733240976,Best Wallet Hits $2M in 1 Week of Public Presale – Next-Gen Wallet Built for 190% $KAIA-Like Gains,"Leading Web3 wallet, Best Wallet ($BEST) , has raised over $2 million in its public presale, reaching this milestone just one week after launching. The presale follows a successful private round, which raised $1 million in two weeks from users of the Best Wallet app. After opening to the public on November 25, the project swiftly added another $1 million. Strong interest from early investors signals a potential shift away from older-generation wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet, toward more advanced solutions. Built with features tailored to the current market environment, Best Wallet is designed to maximize returns and handle price surges such as the 200% increase seen by Kaia ($KAIA) in just one month. Best Wallet’s presale has a current price tag on $BEST at $0.0229 per token, but it will rise within the next 24 hours as the presale progresses to its next stage. Bitcoin’s selling pressure can’t deter the bulls, who are now shifting their focus to altcoins Crypto investors’ fervor for gains remains strong, even as Bitcoin ($BTC) struggles to break past the $100,000 mark. Compounding this, there’s potential selling pressure on Bitcoin as the U.S. government moves 10,000 $BTC seized from the Silk Road dark web marketplace to Coinbase. Yet, investor sentiment remains resilient. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index still registers a “greed” reading, suggesting that while investors may lack the momentum to push one Bitcoin past a six-figure valuation, they’re eager to capitalize on altcoins. Take XRP, for example, which has surged 14.2% in the last 24 hours and an impressive 95.91% in the past week. Another standout, as mentioned, is $KAIA, which saw its market valuation skyrocket to $2 billion in just a few weeks, having flipped a 200% return since November 5. Source: CoinGecko Such stories of rapid price gains are becoming a common theme in the current bull market. However, despite all the positive momentum, not all investors are quick to act – particularly those still relying on legacy wallets that are ill-equipped to handle fast-moving market dynamics. As a result, they’ve missed out on opportunities and failed to maximize potential gains from moves like those made by $XRP and $KAIA. This is where Best Wallet comes in. Launched in 2024, it introduced a new wave of features designed specifically to navigate the current market landscape – a true case of market foresight. Best Wallet offers new features specifically designed for the 2024 to 2025 bull run As the market continues to evolve, it’s crucial for investors to capitalize on opportunities before the majority of the move has already happened. Best Wallet sets itself apart from other wallets in the industry by introducing a powerful tool designed to help investors spot the best opportunities in the current bull market. Called “Upcoming Tokens,” this feature scans and evaluates new projects to identify solid investment opportunities – particularly those that are yet to launch on exchanges and priced at a massive discount before the broader market catches on. One clear example of Best Wallet’s success is Catslap ($SLAP), which has provided investors with an impressive 4,690.3% return, currently priced at $0.005612. A mere $1,000 investment would have grown to $47,657.56, reflecting a 46.66x return. Source: CoinGecko But $SLAP isn’t the only success story. Best Wallet also featured Pepe Unchained when its presale raised $17 million. Since then, its market cap has surged to over $60 million, and with tier-1 listings on the horizon, it has strong potential to perform similarly to $SLAP – or even better. Another recently launched Pepe-themed meme coin, Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE), is also featured on Upcoming Tokens. Like $SLAP and $PEPU, it holds significant moonshot potential. $WEPE presale is now live in Upcoming Tokens! @WEPEToken gives holders access to top-tier trading insights, exclusive market calls, and access to private insider groups.

These projects are very likely to perform well upon exchange listings, with Crypto All-Stars introducing the first unified meme coin staking platform, and Flockerz pioneering the first vote-to-earn (V2E) powered meme coin. This ability to identify and feature high-potential tokens is one of the key reasons Best Wallet’s user base has been growing at a rapid rate of over 50% month-over-month. More investors are flocking to Best Wallet to take advantage of the lucrative opportunities offered by this next-gen wallet. Best Wallet’s features would allow $BEST to go to the moon Best Wallet ’s ability to identify promising new projects is not its only strength – it’s also uniquely designed to provide investors with transactional advantages when trading. By integrating with over 200 decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and more than 20 cross-chain bridges, Best Wallet offers competitive fees that set it apart in the market. Additionally, its seamless swaps and off-ramping capabilities are enhanced through integrations with Alchemy Pay, MoonPay, and other services. These integrations allow users to convert crypto into over 100 fiat currencies (USD, EUR, GBP) and deposit funds directly into their bank accounts. Users unlock all of these benefits simply by holding $BEST tokens. In addition, $BEST tokens provide access to Best Wallet’s full suite of services – including lower transaction fees on its DEX and the upcoming Best Card debit card. With a growing user base, demand for the $BEST token is likely to rise, mirroring the success of the tokens featured in Upcoming Tokens. For early investors to fully capitalize on the potential returns from $BEST, it’s crucial to buy tokens during the presale phase to maximize gains.

In the lofty role, Tenreiro will supervise the lawsuits and investigations within the Division of Enforcement that provide the backbone of the SEC’s regulatory work across industries. Tenreiro’s Path to Leadership Joining the SEC’s crypto assets and cyber unit as deputy chief in October 2022, Tenreiro rapidly rose to take the helm of the division when his predecessor, David Hirsch, left the agency in mid-2023. Under his tenure, the crypto unit launched several high-profile enforcement actions, including lawsuits against major exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken, and a lengthy court fight with Ripple Labs. His notable achievements included the record settlement of $4.47 billion from Terraform Labs and its former CEO, Do Kwon, in what became the largest settlement in the history of the SEC. This historic settlement showcased Tenreiro as an aggressive enforcer within the financial world. A Controversial Figure Tenreiro’s hard-nosed approach to crypto enforcement has earned him praise and criticism in equal measure. Observers within the industry applaud him for holding players in an unregulated market to account, while critics such as crypto lawyer John Deaton claim that he has overplayed his hand, stifling innovation. His name is also associated with controversial cases, such as the SEC’s lawsuit against Terraform Labs and the accusations of misconduct during the agency’s probe into crypto firm Debt Box that forced two SEC attorneys to resign. A New Leadership Landscape Tenreiro’s appointment comes amid broader changes at the top of the SEC. Laura D’Allaird and Mark Sylvester have been appointed co-chiefs of crypto assets and cyber, a role previously held by Tenreiro. Meanwhile, Tenreiro’s elevation to the position comes amid the most politically charged era and possible regulatory changes under a new administration. President-elect Donald Trump’s promise to scale back scrutiny of the crypto industry could go a long way in determining the tone for the SEC’s enforcement agenda. By taking up the mantle, Tenreiro will be positioned at the fulcrum point to dictate not just the SEC’s enforcement game but probably that of crypto regulation in the United States.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | LUNA | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/jorge-tenreiro-becomes-sec-litigation-counsel/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png
37175368,https://finbold.com/?p=216625,1733240916,"Beware: This pattern could trigger a Bitcoin crash below $90,000","Bitcoin ( BTC ) continues to reject key resistance levels, with a cryptocurrency analyst warning that the asset will likely crash below $90,000 based on the technical setup . Specifically, Bitcoin is forming a potential head-and-shoulders on the hourly timeframe, a classic bearish technical pattern , according to cryptocurrency on-chain expert Ali Martinez in a post on X on December 3. Notably, the pattern is marked by a peak (the head) flanked by two lower peaks (the shoulders), and it has historically signaled a price reversal. In this case, Bitcoin is hovering near $95,000, aligning with the neckline of this pattern. Martinez suggested the target could plunge below $90,000 if a breakdown occurs. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView /Ali_charts With Bitcoin trading in the range of $94,000 and $95,000, Martinez noted that it is just above the critical support level at $93,000, marked by the lower boundary of a symmetrical triangle pattern. Bitcoin could revisit the demand zone around $91,000 and $90,000 if the support fails, potentially leading to further bearish momentum. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Indeed, if this pattern is realized, it will dent the cryptocurrency community’s hopes that Bitcoin will hit the $100,000 mark. The leading digital asset has flirted with this price target as part of the post-election bull run . Bitcoin’s push to $100,000 To this end, some analysts still believe there is a path to Bitcoin hitting a new record high. For instance, crypto trader and analyst Michaël van de Poppe, in a post on X on December 3, stated that there is a need for patience, noting that if Bitcoin reclaims the $98,000 level, it will usher in the asset’s momentum toward the ‘magic wonderland’ of $100,000. “BTC still patiently waiting to break $98K to get ourselves into the magic wonderland of $100K+. I feel for all those livestreams with countdowns, might take some time,” he said. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Overall, as Bitcoin’s push toward $100,000 remains in focus, key market players are showing confidence in the asset. For instance, software company MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR ) has continued its Bitcoin buying spree, adding 15,400 BTC for approximately $1.5 billion at an average price of $95,976 per Bitcoin. The acquisition brings the company’s total holdings to 402,100 BTC, acquired for $23.4 billion at an average of $58,263 per BTC. The current value of its Bitcoin stash is estimated at around $38 billion. Regarding corporate investment in Bitcoin, attention is now on Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), where the company’s shareholders will vote on a proposal to add the asset to the company’s balance sheet on December 10. If approved, this move could be the catalyst Bitcoin needs to break $100,000 before the year ends.

37175124,https://finbold.com/?p=216622,1733240081,What’s next for Terra Classic after LUNC’s 80% rally,"Though noted for its long-term volatility and for failing to participate in the 2024 bull market since early March, Terra Classic ( LUNC ) has made great strides in recent weeks. Specifically, the project, which was continued by its community after Terraform Labs (TFL) collapsed in 2022, shows a 19.75% surge to LUNC’s press time price of $0.0001546 in the last 24 hours, and the 30-day chart is even more impressive, demonstrating that the token is up 89.80%. LUNC 30-day price chart. Source: CojnMarketCap Why did LUNC rally 80% in 30 days Such performance is not particularly surprising, given the good news associated with Terra Classic that emerged in recent months and the overall cryptocurrency market sentiment. To begin with, Terraform Labs received court permission for its bankruptcy plan, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) agreeing to be paid only after creditors’ cryptocurrency claims are satisfied. The resolution fell in line with expectations , as evidenced by LUNC’s 5% climb in the 24 hours that preceded the hearing. Additionally, the price action has likely been driven by a massive deflationary move – the biggest burn in LUNC’s history – recorded in early November. The 137 billion token burn came shortly after the team announced the closure of the Shuttle Bridge interface and the elimination of all remaining cryptocurrency in the associated wallets. LUNC burn chart. Source: Lunc Metrics More broadly, numerous digital assets have recently entered into a frenzy as Donald Trump’s re-election – and the confirmation SEC Chair Gary Gensler will resign on January 20, 2025 – sent Bitcoin (BTC) toward $100,000 and Ethereum ( ETH ) above $3,500. The developments also enabled other prominent cryptocurrencies – long depressed by regulatory and similar issues – to skyrocket, with XRP , arguably the star of the current phase of the bull market, surging 403.20% in the last month. XRP 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold Can LUNC make a massive comeback in 2025? Despite the current momentum – and despite deflationary measures implemented by the Terra Classic team – LUNC’s rally remains fraught. The token is well-known for its volatility, and the network’s staking and minting mechanisms remain a concern . Furthermore, Terra Classic’s association with one of the highest-profile cryptocurrency scandals and the collapse that, arguably, triggered the ‘crypto winter,’ means that the ongoing rally is probably more a sign of the broader digital assets optimism and the euphoria from the bankruptcy finally winding down than a show of confidence in LUNC’s future.

Bitcoin's efforts to surpass $100,000 have encountered strong resistance from bears, resulting in increased volatility in recent days. On Monday, Bitcoin was rejected near $97,500, falling about $3,000 in just a few hours before stabilizing slightly above $95,000.Today, Bitcoin continued its downward trend, dropping 1.9% to $93,940 on Tuesday. This price decline coincides with a noticeable reduction in long-term Bitcoin holdings, adding complexity to the market outlook.Declining Long-Term Bitcoin HoldingsRecent data from IntoTheBlock reveals a significant trend: long-term Bitcoin holders have been gradually reducing their holdings. As of now, these holders—defined as wallets that have held Bitcoin for more than 155 days—control around 12.45 million BTC, the lowest level since July 2022.This marks a decrease of nearly 10% in long-term holder balances during this cycle, a less severe drop compared to previous market corrections. In 2021, long-term holders reduced their balances by 15%; in 2017, the decline reached 26%.This trend suggests that Bitcoin holders are either selling off for profits or shifting their holdings to alternative storage options like cold wallets or exchanges. https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1863870874643791972Shrinking Network ActivityAlongside the decrease in long-term holdings, Bitcoin's network activity also shows a notable decline. IntoTheBlock's data highlights that the number of new Bitcoin addresses in the last seven days dropped by 5.94%. Active addresses, which represent the daily users transacting on the network, have decreased by 1.25%. Bitcoin Addresses Change, IntoTheBlock Furthermore, there has been a 10.50% reduction in addresses with zero balances over the same period. These declines in network activity suggest that Bitcoin may be experiencing user fatigue, which could be a result of ongoing market corrections or broader disinterest. US Government Moving Bitcoin Amid Passive MarketIn related news , the U.S. government has resumed transferring Bitcoin after a nearly four-month hiatus. On Monday, a government-linked wallet moved 19,800 BTC to a Coinbase Prime wallet, valued at $1.92 billion at the time of transfer.Despite some skepticism surrounding the move, analysts suggest that the transfer is more likely related to custody actions than asset sales.

37178362,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=103774,1733239970,Here are Two Crucial Points of Interest if Bitcoin Dips,"Bitcoin's march toward the coveted $100K milestone is entering a period of patience, with analysts warning of a potential dip before a bounce back. The leading cryptocurrency has maintained a stable price at around $95K for several consecutive days without any decisive price movement.In a recent commentary , analyst Michaël van de Poppe emphasized that Bitcoin needs to break through the $98K resistance to build the momentum necessary for a $100K rally. Once this key psychological barrier is surpassed, he believes the move to the widely anticipated $100,000 mark will become achievable.However, while optimism remains high, Van de Poppe acknowledged that the wait may take longer than many expect. Points of Interest if Bitcoin DipsIn the event of a dip, he identified two critical support zones, which he referred to as “points of interest.” These zones lie around the $89,500 and $85,300 levels. Bitcoin chart by Michaël van de Poppe Should Bitcoin retrace to these areas, traders might find a potential rebound opportunity. Below these levels, the next major support lies at $79,700. The analysis suggests that Bitcoin’s bullish trend would remain intact unless these lower support levels are breached. “Good times are coming,” Van de Poppe reassured market participants.Meanwhile, analyst Ali Martinez has expressed a similar outlook on Bitcoin's potential targets if the market dips. Sharing Bitcoin’s chart on the four-hour timeframe, he highlighted key buying interest zones around $90,500 and $85,200 as critical support levels to watch.In another update, Martinez pointed out that Bitcoin’s price action was forming a head-and-shoulders pattern, a historically bearish indicator. He emphasized that this pattern further supports the likelihood of a drop to $90K. At press time, Bitcoin has dipped by 1.26%, trading at $95,110. Additionally, as Bitcoin continues to stall around the $95K mark, data from Santiment reveals that daily active wallets, whale activity, and transaction volume have all slowed over the past week. Martinez emphasized that the Bitcoin market needs a spike in these metrics for the uptrend to continue.Bitcoin’s Bull Potential Amid these bearish signals, Bitcoin still has a major bullish thesis. Analysts have noted that historically, the market tends to move in the opposite direction of the prevailing market sentiments.Essentially, as many continue to call for a $90K Bitcoin, the market could oppose this sentiment , with Bitcoin potentially breaking out significantly to the upside while many expect dips.Martinez suggests that, in this case, the market could see Bitcoin reach $120K to $150K before experiencing its first major cycle dip of around 30%.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/03/here-are-two-crucial-points-of-interest-if-bitcoin-dips/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=here-are-two-crucial-points-of-interest-if-bitcoin-dips,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), the second-largest meme coin, retreated to $0.00002765, down by 16.2% from its highest level this month. This retreat was mostly due to the ongoing pullback of Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin slipped below $95,000 as the rally to $100,000 seemed elusive. Still, crypto analysts believe that SHIB price has more upside now that the altcoin season index has jumped to 80. In most periods, meme coins like Shiba Inu tend to perform well when altcoins are rising. You might also like: XRP price surges 15% in 24H as network growth drives rally, but will it last? Another potential catalyst for the coin is the increase in the number of Shiba Inu tokens being burned. Data by Shiburn shows that the burn rate rose by 3,426% to over 2.02 billion. This means that over 410 trillion tokens have now been burned, leaving the circulating supply at 583 trillion. https://twitter.com/army_shiba/status/1863861808605302943 Token burns are used to create value for a crypto project by reducing the number of coins in circulation. In Shiba Inu’s case, these burned tokens come from fees in projects like Shibarium and ShibaSwap. Shibarium is the network’s layer-2 network, while ShibaSwap is a decentralized exchange where users swap tokens. Data shows that the ShibaSwap has over $26 million in assets, while Shibarium has handled almost 600 million transactions. The BONE tokens collected in these chains are converted into SHIB and burned. Shiba Inu price could jump by 60% SHIB chart | source: crypto.news Technicals point to a potential SHIB price jump in the near term. It has formed a golden cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) flipped each other. This cross is a popular bullish sign in technical analysis. Shiba Inu has formed a cup and handle chart pattern, a popular sign of a bullish continuation. The recent consolidation is part of the handle portion of this pattern. Its MACD indicator has moved above the zero line, while the MVRV indicator has risen to 3.2. Therefore, the coin will likely bounce back and retest the year-to-date high of $0.000045, which is about 63% above the current level. A drop below the support at $0.0000022 will invalidate the bullish view.

The analyst has grounded his bullish prediction on the Cardano price action, providing insights into its potential future movements based on technical analysis and current market conditions. ADA Price Set Sights On $4.88 Alan Santana, a prominent TradingView analyst, has released a report declaring that additional price growth for Cardano is possible in this bull cycle. Sharing a detailed price chart of Cardano’s movements from 2021 to the present and its future price trajectory, the analyst projected a significant rise to $4.88 by 2026. Related Reading: Fantom Price Breakout: Analyst Shares Anatomy Of FTM’s 18,000% Move To $150 By 2025 Alan Santana revealed that the ADA price has been in a long consolidation phase for 915 days since May 2022. Surprisingly, the popular altcoin had broken out of this range earlier this month, producing the highest bullish volume ever seen. Cardano’s current market position indicates that it is steadily emerging from a market bottom, a development that often precedes a sustained upward trend. Alan Santana has underscored that Cardano’s recent trend shift is only the beginning, as the cryptocurrency has more room for growth in this bull cycle. Furthermore, the analyst revealed that the primary focus of his technical chart analysis is not to predict a new all-time high or determine how far up Cardano will reach by 2025. Instead, the analysis aims to highlight Cardano’s short-term price action based on a long-term chart. Looking at his price chart, Alan Santana has pinpointed the 0.8875 Fibonacci level as the main support level for Cardano. This support was initially a resistance level ADA had conquered during last month’s bullish breakout. The analyst underscored that the breakout signified the highest level the ADA price had reached since May 2022. Alan Santana has predicted that if Cardano can break above the main support at 0.8875, the market sentiment will remain “super bullish,” and additional price growth should be expected. On the other hand, if Cardano fails to break the 0.8875 level, it could drop to a secondary support level at 0.6330. If Cardano faces a retracement to 0.6330, the TradingView analyst has emphasized that the cryptocurrency’s overall market structure will still remain strong. These solid fundamentals have prompted the analyst to forecast a major rally to $2 for ADA, if it can maintain a price above the 1.30 Fibonacci level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $245,000? Here’s When You Should Be Expecting It Will Cardano Mirror XRP Price Surge? Cardano is currently exhibiting potential that mirrors XRP, as the optimism surrounding the ongoing bull market could ignite a price surge for the ADA price. Since the beginning of the year, Cardano’s price has been stuck in a consolidated and declining state. This underperformance led to growing concerns among crypto members, with many labeling ADA a dead coin. However, with new signs of a potential price rally, Cardano could achieve XRP-like gains if market sentiment shifts in its favor. As of this writing, the price of XRP has been trading at $2.6 after surging by more than 428% in the past month.

The top US crypto exchange came under fire online after it announced last week that it wouldn’t support Celo’s ( CELO ) upcoming migration from a standalone layer-1 chain to an Ethereum layer-2. Multiple Celo executives blasted the decision, including Celo Foundation president Rene Reinsberg and Marek Olszewski, the chief executive of Celo developer cLabs, who said Coinbase’s announcement felt “like a wrench in Ethereum’s layer-2-centric scaling roadmap.” Coinbase, however, says it plans to “reevaluate” Celo L2 after the technical migration is complete . “Any accusation that Coinbase does not support the scalability of Ethereum is not true. Coinbase is focused on being a bridge to the cryptoeconomy and we are in support of L1s and L2s.” The exchange says its customers must withdraw any CELO from their accounts by January 13th. The project is scheduled to migrate to a layer-2 solution on January 16th. Celo says the migration will have numerous technical benefits. “Native bridging between Celo and Ethereum, which was previously not possible, will now be a reality. This advancement significantly enhances the security of token transfers by reducing reliance on external bridges, which have often been a point of vulnerability. With native bridging, Celo can offer a more secure and streamlined experience for users, ensuring that transactions within our ecosystem are both safe and reliable.” Celo launched a layer-2 testnet in July.

He added, “Eventually, we expect these vehicles to emerge into standard portfolio diversifiers with large funds allocating 1-3% of their capital to these funds due to BTC’s tendency to improve risk-adjusted returns.” BlackRock’s success is reflective of the growing demand for Bitcoin ETFs, with IBIT becoming the third-strongest ETF in the U.S. by year-to-date flows, trailing only larger funds like Invesco’s QQQ. Broader Impact on the Crypto Market The rise of Bitcoin ETFs has played a role in Bitcoin’s record price movements this year. Bitcoin is trading at $94,762 as of writing, a 38% increase since March when BlackRock CEO Larry Fink described IBIT as “the fastest-growing ETF in the history of ETFs.” He expressed surprise at the pace of Bitcoin’s price appreciation during a Fox Business interview. In October, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink stated that Bitcoin’s growth is not tied to political events , including the Trump vs. Harris presidential race.

November alone saw a record $6.6 billion in inflows , demonstrating robust investor interest. Market observers believe this surge has been instrumental in driving Bitcoin’s price to all-time highs, as ETFs simplify Bitcoin exposure for traditional investors. The cumulative holdings of U.S. Bitcoin ETFs are now approaching 1.1 million BTC, close to the estimated stash attributed to Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto’s holdings, based on mining patterns, are thought to range between 600,000 and 1.5 million BTC, though the widely accepted figure is 1.1 million BTC.

The wind farm, with 240 megawatts of interconnection capacity and 114 MW of operational wind generation, will allow MARA to create a vertically integrated operation with zero-marginal energy costs, according to a company press release. The deal represents a strategic shift for MARA as it aims to integrate renewable energy into its mining operations, which require substantial computational power. Mining involves solving complex mathematical problems to validate transactions on the Bitcoin ( BTC ) network, consuming significant energy. The proposed data center will be powered entirely by the wind farm, reducing reliance on traditional energy sources and alleviating strain on the Texas power grid. Fred Thiel, MARA’s CEO, emphasized the broader benefits of the acquisition, including reducing Bitcoin production costs and repurposing older mining hardware. “This acquisition serves as a blueprint for collaboration between the energy and data center sectors to create long-term value while advancing sustainability initiatives,” Thiel said.

Declining BTC dominance has paved the way for the altcoin season, with over 75% of the top 100 altcoins consistently outperforming Bitcoin. Let’s deep-dive into the top 10 altcoins for beginners to buy in December 2024. Table of Contents Why Bitcoin dominance matters to altcoin traders What makes an altcoin worth investing in Top 10 altcoins to buy in December 2024 to prepare for 2025 Strategic considerations and risk Why Bitcoin dominance matters to altcoin traders Bitcoin ( BTC ) dominance is a percentage measure of how much of the total crypto market value belongs to BTC. This is an important metric for traders as it helps identify how capital is distributed between Bitcoin and altcoins. At 55.81%, over half of the total crypto market value belongs to Bitcoin and the rest of the capital is likely flowing into altcoins. Typically, a decline in Bitcoin dominance during bull markets is a sign of potentially higher returns on altcoins. Bitcoin dominance is therefore used to identify altcoin trading opportunities. Bitcoin dominance suddenly drops, signalling the start of an altseason, a time period where over 75% of the top 100 altcoins consistently outperform BTC in a 90-day timeframe. The shift occurs in capital flow, and traders capitalize on the opportunity by minimizing exposure to BTC while investing in high-liquidity altcoins. The Bitcoin dominance chart on TradingView shows a likelihood of a nearly 5% decline to the confluence of 100 and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) at 53%. Bitcoin dominance % 1W chart | Source: TradingView.com You might also like: Santiment: FOMO unlikely to hinder further market growth What makes an altcoin worth investing in In order to make the most of the altseason, beginners need to consider these five points as a checklist when buying an altcoin. Fundamental use case and utility The purpose of the real-world use case of an altcoin is one of the most important points to consider before buying a token. Questions to consider are: what is the real-world use case? How do blockchain technology and the token simplify an existing problem? What is the unique value proposition of the altcoin? Two altcoins that fit the criteria and rank within the top 100 cryptos by market capitalization are Polygon ( MATIC ) and Chainlink ( LINK ). MATIC is a layer-2 scaling solution that enables faster and cheaper transactions for users while capitalizing on Ethereum ( ETH ) as the underlying security layer. Chainlink connects smart contracts with real-world data and finds utility in traditional and decentralized financial institutions, crypto exchanges and banks. Tokens with no utility may enable short-term gains; however, once the hype surrounding the project dies, most token holders typically face unrealized losses. Market capitalization and liquidity An altcoin’s market capitalization is a measure of the size and relevance of the project among traders. Large market cap projects like Ethereum, Binance Coin ( BNB ) are typically considered safer than other altcoins, the potential of price gains is low to moderate in most cases. But mid to small-market cap projects, meme coins on Base, and Ripple ( XRP ) have a relatively higher potential for gains with higher risk. Liquidity ensures traders have an out in the case of large price swings or corrections. Litecoin ( LTC ) is a large market-cap altcoin known for its robust liquidity and has been considered “silver” to Bitcoin’s “gold” since its inception. Aptos ( APT ) is a mid-market-cap token focused on scalability and security. Development activity and team transparency Evaluating the team behind the project and keeping track of ongoing developments are key steps in ensuring the token has a committed team. Tracking roadmap progress, identifying whether the team is credible within the blockchain community, and following Discord or X commentary on the project are other effective ways. Cardano ( ADA ) is popular within the crypto community for its rigorous academic approach and has one of the most active developer communities. Optimism ( OP ), an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, has consistent updates and a transparent development team. Community support and adoption Most meme coins criticized for lack of utility compensate for the same with support from a strong community online. This is evident from address activity, trade volume, participation in burn/staking and airdrops announced by the project. Altcoins with community support have a relatively higher number of supporters on forums like Reddit, X, or Telegram. Tracking project partnerships and integrations is another way to identify the token’s relevance and adoption among market participants. Solana ( SOL ) yielded double-digit gains for holders this market cycle, flipping Ethereum in transaction volume on decentralized exchanges and protocol revenue in October and November 2024. Dogecoin ( DOGE ) started out as a meme coin, however strong community support contributed to the increasing adoption for microtransactions and tipping across the crypto ecosystem. Risk management: Volatility and regulatory landscape Altcoins are inherently considered riskier than Bitcoin, so beginners should assess the volatility through historical price movements, listing on exchange platforms with clear listing criteria, regulations and existing lawsuits in the U.S. and other economies. XRP is rallying despite ongoing regulatory scrutiny, as it remains a popular altcoin for cross-border payments with a clear use case on the XRPLedger. Stellar ( XLM ) is similar to XRP, Stellar focuses on cross-border payments and development of central bank digital currencies, with regulatory clarity. Top 10 altcoins to buy in December 2024 to prepare for 2025 Solana (SOL) Solana is a layer 1 token that competes with Ethereum and outperforms the latter in several metrics this cycle. From decentralized exchange volume to protocol revenue and daily active users, Solana has flipped Ether, fueling the narrative of a “flipping” where the SOL market cap exceeds that of ETH. Between $200 and $210 is the ideal buy zone for sidelined traders, the resistance is the 2024 peak and the psychologically important $300 level. The target is $359 when SOL enters price discovery in this cycle. SOL/USDT daily price chart | Source: Crypto.news Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is likely to outperform Solana, at least in the short term, based on on-chain metrics from derivatives trading platforms like Binance.

37177087,https://cryptonews.com/?p=315512,1733239318,Cardano Apps Get a Backup Layer Through Blockfrost and Filecoin Collab,"Blockfrost and Filecoin Foundation (FF) are working to integrate Filecoin’s decentralized storage capabilities as a backup layer for Cardano apps built with Blockfrost. The site describes Blockfrost as Cardano’s API with over 100 endpoints, designed for easy access to Cardano blockchain. Meanwhile, Filecoin Foundation is an independent organization that supports Filecoin’s governance and growth. According to the press release shared with Cryptonews , the collaboration between the two “underscores the coordinated efforts of two legacy layer-1 blockchains and marks a step toward making decentralization the standard for the next generation of blockchain applications.” It will improve data redundancy, scalability, quality assurance, and decentralization across the Cardano ecosystem. Data redundancy ensures that critical data is stored across a distributed network and protected against loss, corruption, or manipulation. Additionally, Blockfrost has integrated with Filecoin via Lighthouse . The latter is a platform on Filecoin, which offers perpetual storage, encryption, custom gateways, and multi-chain smart contracts. Speaking of developers, Marek Mahut, CEO at Blockfrost, commented that this integration can give them “peace of mind, knowing that their applications benefit from Filecoin’s decentralized storage and redundancy features.” Bringing Filecoin’s decentralized storage to the Cardano ecosystem helps developers create apps that are “more secure, reliable, and future-proof,” added Clara Tsao, a founding officer at Filecoin Foundation.

Also, it offers additional features without the need to run or maintain complex infrastructure and tooling. Notably, Blockfrost runs the world’s largest decentralized storage network InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) Gateway clusters. Per the team, this allows users to add, pin, and access resources. Therefore, Blockfrost said it would introduce a new service tier for Cardano builders by archiving these IPFS Gateway clusters on Filecoin. The novel tier will include both IPFS and Filecoin storage. Securing on-chain data of Cardano applications on Filecoin enables developers to build on a fully decentralized and resilient storage infrastructure, the teams added. “By extending storage capabilities and adding a premium backup layer, Blockfrost gives developers more tools to build reliable, data-driven applications,” the team said. That said, major benefits of the collaboration include data verifiability, immutable storage, transparent on-chain verifiability, and cryptographic hashing. Filecoin leverages Proof of Replication to ensure data is uniquely stored. At the same time, Proof of Spacetime validates continuous storage over time. “These essential features enable the creation of tamper-proof, auditable datasets,” said the team, “paving the way to deploying trustworthy AI applications with Blockfrost and empowering reliable, decentralized model training.” Meanwhile, in late January 2024, Cardano announced its investment in Five Binaries’ Blockfrost API. Since 2020, the latter has grown to become a key element of Cardano infrastructure, the blog post said . Blockfrost performs “a valuable and trusted function” for projects building on Cardano and offers dapp developers “a cost-effective, highly scalable solution to take their applications from testing through to full deployment,” the announcement said.

37174810,https://finbold.com/?p=216616,1733239215,"Uranium.io, a uranium trading dApp powered by Tezos, goes live","Uranium.io, a decentralized application ( dApp ) on Tezos ( XTZ ), is now live, as reported to Finbold on Tuesday, December 3. Since uranium has traditionally been locked behind institutional gates, Uranium.io seeks to make the chemical more accessible to investors. The platform is backed by Curzon Uranium, a global trading firm with over $1 billion in uranium transactions, and Archax, the first registered crypto exchange in the United Kingdom. A surge in uranium demand Global demand for uranium has been growing exponentially as more and more governments are pursuing net-zero emissions and turning to nuclear power as a more ESG-friendly solution . Likewise, the new artificial intelligence ( AI ) industry has been investing heavily in nuclear power to meet its growing energy needs. For example, Microsoft ( MSFT ) is eyeing the Three Mile Island reactor, Google ( GOOGL ) has partnered with Kairos Power, and Amazon ( AMZN ) recently invested $500 million in X-Energy Reactor Company. Unlike precious metals, uranium trading required over-the-counter deals with minimum lot sizes of 50,000 lbs, which amounts to a $4.2 million buy-in. Consequently, retail investors have typically had to rely on exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ). Uranium.io seeks to break price barriers by tokenizing physical uranium and moving ownership on-chain. This approach is expected to eliminate steep entry costs and give retail investors wider access to the chemical. Simplifying uranium trading The platform operates on Etherlink, a Layer-2 ( L2 ) blockchain leveraging Tezos Smart Rollups. Users can easily connect their wallets , complete an onboarding process, and purchase U3O8, also known as “yellowcake,” a key component in nuclear fuel production. Trade settlements and custody transfers are managed by smart contracts, which removes the need for intermediaries. All uranium traded on Uranium.io is stored by Cameco, a leading uranium provider. Bringing more real-world assets on chain According to VanEck, the market capitalization of institutional tokenized assets soared from near zero to over $300 million in 2023 . Arthur Breitman, Tezos co-founder, highlighted the innovation behind Uranium.io: “Real world assets on chain are compelling when they meaningfully reduce friction or enable new economic arrangements. The launch of uranium.io on Tezos is a perfect example – transforming a market previously restricted by massive lot sizes and OTC overhead into something accessible and composable. This is particularly exciting as nuclear power is experiencing a revival.” With Uranium.io, retail investors will have direct access to one of the world’s most critical commodities .

Crypto's Role In The Trump Era,"Summary Buoyed by lofty promises of deregulation, key appointments with strong ties to the sector, and a growing chorus of mainstream institutional and retail support, cryptocurrencies have soared to unprecedented levels, surpassing $95,000. Trump’s return to power has emboldened crypto advocates. Yet, this optimism should be tempered by the inherent risks of overexuberance. Is crypto genuinely undergoing a reinvention, or is this merely another phase of speculative excess - a redux of 2021, when crypto prices soared only to collapse a year later? The cryptocurrency world has long had a tendency to thrive on volatility, sentiment, and narratives of reinvention. Yet, the recent surge in crypto enthusiasm following Donald Trump’s reelection represents what many have described as a unique moment even in this hyperactive market’s history. Buoyed by lofty promises of deregulation, key appointments with strong ties to the sector, and a growing chorus of mainstream institutional and retail support, cryptocurrencies have soared to unprecedented levels. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), the most widely known and arguably the flagship cryptocurrency, has shattered records by surpassing $95,000. In response, the broader digital assets ecosystem has become awash with speculative optimism - some might even argue it borders on mania. Yet, lurking beneath the glossy veneer of digital assets is the shadow of recent scandals, most notably the catastrophic collapse of FTX. Is crypto genuinely undergoing a reinvention, or is this merely another phase of speculative excess - a redux of 2021, when crypto prices soared only to collapse a year later? The unusual convergence of politics and cryptocurrencies that we have observed lately has created what can best be described as a perfect storm of sentiment-driven market dynamics. Trump’s return to power has emboldened crypto advocates, providing them with a leader who not only sympathizes with their aspirations but also promises to champion policies that could revolutionize the industry. Yet, this optimism should be tempered by the inherent risks of overexuberance. To understand where this moment might lead, it’s quite important to examine the promises made, the reactions they’ve triggered, and the potential risks that lie ahead. Trump’s Crypto Agenda: Promise of Deregulation When Trump was elected for a second term, his victory was seen as a watershed moment for the crypto industry. During the campaign trail, President-elect Trump attended numerous crypto-centric events and promised sweeping reforms aimed at removing barriers to growth, including replacing high-profile regulatory figures such as SEC Chair Gary Gensler. These moves were celebrated as a liberation from what many in the crypto world perceive as overly aggressive oversight stifling innovation. Trump’s rhetoric - focused on dismantling regulatory obstacles and fostering opportunities for the crypto sector - along with his close associations with major crypto enthusiasts like Elon Musk, Marc Andreessen, and David Sacks, has been particularly appealing to an industry often at odds with traditional financial regulators. One of the centerpieces of Trump’s crypto agenda is his proposal to establish a ""national bitcoin reserve."" This bold, albeit unconventional, idea has captured the imagination of many market participants, painting a picture of a government-backed endorsement of Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Combined with promises to ease restrictions on mining, trading, and exchange listings, this agenda has fueled unprecedented optimism. The mere hint of such policies was enough to send Bitcoin’s value soaring by nearly 30% in the immediate aftermath of the election, as speculative fervor gripped investors eager to capitalize on the anticipated regulatory shift. This optimism is not without historical precedent. Over the past decade, cryptocurrencies have thrived during periods of deregulation or limited oversight, as their proponents argue that such conditions enable the innovation and rapid adoption often stifled by traditional financial systems. However, this same environment has also facilitated some of the industry’s most catastrophic failures, raising questions about whether unfettered growth can truly be sustained without a solid regulatory foundation. Key Appointments Fuel Optimism The promises extended beyond deregulation. Trump’s nomination of Howard Lutnick, a Wall Street veteran with strong ties to the crypto industry, as Commerce Secretary bolstered the perception that cryptocurrencies might have a powerful advocate in the new administration. Lutnick’s firm, Cantor Fitzgerald, oversees billions in Tether ( USDT-USD ) reserves and holds a financial stake in the stablecoin’s success. His influence is anticipated to shape policies in ways that could offer significant advantages to certain players within the crypto ecosystem. Lutnick’s reputation as a pragmatic and assertive Wall Street operator has led to expectations that his tenure could herald a new era of crypto-friendly policymaking, though it remains uncertain whether his association with Tether will primarily benefit stablecoins or the broader cryptocurrency market. Meanwhile, the announcement of Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy as co-leaders of a newly established Department of Government Efficiency lends credence to the perception that the new administration is poised to embrace the digital frontier. Both Musk and Ramaswamy are ardent crypto enthusiasts, and their roles could carry significant implications. Musk, in particular, has publicly endorsed cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ), which has consistently fueled retail investor enthusiasm, transforming a meme-inspired token into a serious market contender with the seventh-highest market capitalization among digital assets. These appointments signal to investors that the Trump administration is serious about fostering a crypto-friendly environment. The appointments not only bring expertise and influence but also embody a shift in how cryptocurrencies are perceived - not as fringe assets but potentially as integral components of the future financial landscape. Euphoria Meets Speculative Excess The crypto market’s reaction has been swift and dramatic. Bitcoin’s record-breaking run past $95,000 reflects not just speculative enthusiasm but also a broader shift in sentiment among institutional and retail investors alike. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to Bitcoin, which gained regulatory approval earlier this year after a court ruling which paved the way for an SEC approval, have drawn tens of billions in inflows. Well-established asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity have launched products that cater to everyday investors, signaling growing mainstream acceptance of digital assets. The recent optimism in the cryptocurrency market has several reasons to be tempered by historical lessons, notably the collapse of FTX in November 2022. Once a leading cryptocurrency exchange, FTX's downfall exposed significant vulnerabilities within the crypto industry. The exchange filed for bankruptcy on November 11, 2022, revealing that over $8 billion in customer funds were misappropriated, leading to a series of bankruptcies among related firms. This event had a profound impact on Bitcoin's perceived role as an inflation hedge. Despite expectations that Bitcoin would protect against inflation, its price plummeted to just over $16,000 during the inflationary peaks of 2022, contradicting the narrative that cryptocurrencies could serve as reliable safeguards against rising prices. (Source: TMC Research) The FTX collapse serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the consequences of unchecked enthusiasm and inadequate oversight in the cryptocurrency sector. It underscores the need for proper regulatory frameworks to prevent similar incidents in the future. The Pitfalls of Excessive Euphoria The parallels between the current surge in crypto prices and past speculative bubbles can sometimes be hard to ignore. Bitcoin’s meteoric rise is driven largely by sentiment rather than fundamentals, a fact acknowledged even by its staunchest proponents. The enthusiasm surrounding Dogecoin, a meme-based cryptocurrency with little intrinsic value, exemplifies this speculative excess. The token has doubled in value since Trump’s election, fueled in no small part by Musk’s public endorsements and his newfound role in government. Meanwhile, Tether, the stablecoin at the center of much of the crypto market’s liquidity, continues to attract scrutiny. Tether’s claims of being fully backed by reserves have long been questioned, and the company faces allegations of facilitating illicit activities. While Lutnick’s role in the administration may shield Tether from immediate regulatory threats, the stablecoin’s long-term stability ultimately depends on transparency - a quality the crypto industry has historically struggled to deliver. The Risks Lurking Beneath The current moment is not without its bright spots. Institutional frameworks like ETFs provide a degree of structure, pricing transparency, and legitimacy that was largely absent in earlier market cycles, offering investors new avenues to engage with the crypto market. However, significant risks remain - not least of which is the fact that most crypto ETFs are structured as trusts rather than registered investment companies (RICs). As such, they are not subject to the requirements of the 1940 Investment Company Act, which affords shareholders certain protections unavailable in products not registered under the Act. Despite these concerns, retail investors - particularly younger generations - tend to overlook such risks, drawn instead by the promise of outsized returns. Many have poured considerable sums into these speculative assets, often without a full understanding of the underlying dangers. Meanwhile, the IRS has ramped up its scrutiny of crypto transactions, ensuring that every gain is taxed to the fullest extent of the law. For many, the allure of quick profits may soon give way to harsh realities as tax bills and sudden market corrections begin to take their toll. Perhaps the most significant risk lies in the broader economic and political landscape. Trump’s policies, while favorable to crypto in the short term, could introduce new layers of complexity. His promise to create a national bitcoin reserve, for example, raises questions about the potential implications for the U.S. dollar and the global financial system. While the idea has energized crypto enthusiasts, skeptics argue that such a move could undermine confidence in traditional monetary systems and may not even be in the best interest for the crypto assets. Balancing Opportunity and Caution In the end, the current wave of crypto enthusiasm is both a reflection of the market’s boundless potential as well as a stark reminder of its inherent fragility. The industry stands at a crossroads: it can capitalize on this moment to institutionalize and mature, or it can potentially become victim to the same forces of mismanagement that have plagued it in the past. While detractors argue that crypto is no more than a speculative, worthless asset class, often drawing comparisons to speculative manias of the past, such as the Tulip mania that gripped the newly independent Dutch Republic in the 1600s, it is hard to argue against the fact that crypto assets - particularly Bitcoin - have been of great value to their holders. Its five-year returns, though highly volatile, have easily outpaced those of traditional market benchmarks such as the S&P 500 by an 11-to-1 ratio. However, as Bitcoin edges closer to the psychological milestone of $100,000, the stakes have never been higher. Caution is certainly warranted, especially as much of the crypto market is still sentiment-driven. Over the next decade, especially with advances in AI, we may see improved valuation techniques that could help us better understand how to value these highly volatile and speculative assets. For now, though, for investors, policymakers, and the public at large, the coming months will reveal whether this is the dawn of a new era for digital assets or the beginning of another painful lesson in the dangers of unchecked speculation.

37174802,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=25819,1733239121,"Namada Launches Mainnet, Introducing Shielded Cross-Chain Transactions","Zug, Switzerland, December 3rd, 2024, Chainwire Namada , the shielded asset hub enabling shielded cross-chain transactions, has officially published its genesis block, marking the launch of its mainnet. Along with the commencement of staking and governance, this marks the start of the first phase of Namada’s five stage decentralized mainnet rollout. This marks an important step forward, offering comprehensive data protection and selective disclosure across the multichain landscape. Introducing Namada Namada is designed to enable the protection of users’ personal data when using on-chain assets and engaging in cross-chain transactions. Its key innovation, the Multi-Asset Shielded Pool (MASP), can support the shielding of user data related to any asset, enabling shielded interactions across different blockchain networks. Namada enables selective disclosure, giving users the ability to share transaction data publicly and to specific parties. Additionally, Namada is introducing a unique shielding rewards system for users protecting their personal data. “Namada’s mainnet is a major accomplishment for the many contributors and community members who have worked hard to take Namada from an early idea to a real, operational protocol,” said Christopher Goes, Namada cofounder. “Individual control of data and freedom of disclosure is necessary for a free society. We aren’t there yet, but the Namada mainnet is an important step in the right direction.” The launch is fully decentralized, with the Anoma Foundation supporting the Namada ecosystem by proposing the mainnet candidate software and genesis balances. However, the Foundation abstains from running validators, ensuring that the Namada community retains full control over the platform’s launch and direction. “Namada is an important missing link for the crypto space. Real adoption has been held back by the lack of user control over sensitive data,” said Namada cofounder Adrian Brink. “The goal of Namada is to give both individual and institutional users, who may have been waiting on the sidelines, the same freedoms and protections they have off-chain.” Key Features of Namada Namada introduces a suite of innovative features designed to protect user data while enabling seamless shielded cross-chain interactions: Shielding Rewards: Namada’s Multi-Asset Shielded Pool (MASP) supports the shielding of data for various assets within a unified shielded set. Users collect shielded set rewards for shielding their assets and enhancing on-chain data protection for everyone. Shielded Actions: Users can engage in cross-chain activity, such as DeFi, while keeping their personal data shielded. User data is protected even when interacting with transparent dApps and chains. On-Chain Governance: NAM token holders participate in governance by staking their tokens to vote on protocol upgrades and other decisions. This mechanism ensures that the community has a direct role in the evolution of the network. Public Goods Funding (PGF): A portion of the NAM inflation is dedicated to funding public goods, supporting projects that benefit the broader Namada ecosystem and beyond. Cubic Proof-of-Stake (CPoS): Namada’s unique staking mechanism incentivizes network security by adjusting staking rewards based on the network’s current staking ratio. Validators and delegators are rewarded for securing the network, with penalties for protocol violations designed to discourage collusion and enhance overall security. Community-Driven Genesis Process This process will unfold in five stages, each driven by community decisions via on-chain governance. Discussions around the mainnet release candidate software, configurations, genesis block draft, and tokenomics have taken place within the Namada community forum , ensuring a transparent, decentralized, and collective approach to the launch. The Anoma Foundation proposed the initial set of genesis allocations, including a total supply of 1 billion NAM tokens with no lockups, distributed among community members, early contributors, and future development initiatives. This decentralized approach ensures that the network’s launch and ongoing governance remain in the hands of its users. Namada is poised to support IBC-based assets initially, but can be upgraded in the future to support additional ecosystems, with the aim of becoming the data protection layer for the entire multichain ecosystem. About Namada Namada is the shielded asset hub rewarding users to protect the multichain. By leveraging advanced zero-knowledge cryptography, Namada enables selective disclosure of personal data, offering unparalleled data protection across assets, applications, and blockchain networks. It introduces shielded cross-chain interactions and shielding rewards for users who protect their data and strengthen its shielded set.

Experts warn the crypto community that December is a prime time for crypto attacks. With people distracted in festivals, crypto scammers have perfect setup to exploit their wallets. What is really going on, lets understand. Why the Holidays Are a Scammer’s Playground December isn’t just about gifts and good vibes—it’s a scammer’s favorite month. Why? Because we’re all distracted. Clicking on emails without thinking, trusting holiday deals that feel urgent, or donating to what seems like a good cause—this is where they get us. [1/7] ScamSniffer November Phishing Report $9,380,000 STOLEN 9,208 VICTIMS November saw one victim lose $661K in stETH within minutes – and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Let's dive into the dark side of Web3… pic.twitter.com/HDyBGh5tPj — Scam Sniffer | Web3 Anti-Scam (@realScamSniffer) December 3, 2024 Last month alone, scammers stole $9.3 million from over 9,200 investors. And while that’s less than October’s massive $20.2 million loss, it’s still mind-blowing. One poor guy even lost $661,000 in stETH just from one malicious blockchain transaction. That’s the crazy part—these aren’t obvious scams. They come disguised as harmless links or signature requests, and bam—your wallet’s drained. Can You Outsmart These Scammers? Look, even experienced investors slip up during this time. But there are ways to stay ahead of these crooks: Double-check everything. Don’t just trust an email or message because it looks legit. Scammers are pros at mimicking official communications. Set up 2FA. Seriously, it’s not just a suggestion—it’s a lifesaver. And avoid using public WiFi for transactions. That free airport WiFi? A trap. Simulate transactions first. Before signing anything, use tools to preview what you’re actually approving. If something looks shady, don’t proceed. Beware of “too-good-to-be-true” offers. Holiday-themed scams, fake giveaways, or crazy discounts are red flags. Trust your gut. At the end of the day, scammers count on us being distracted or greedy. Stay sharp—it’s your best weapon. The Bigger Picture This year alone, crypto theft has hit $1.48 billion as of late November. That’s down 15% from last year, but still, it’s a huge number. Scams and hacks have been part of the crypto world for years—since 2010, over $19 billion has been stolen across 785 incidents. And it’s not just phishing. There’s pump-and-dump schemes, fake wallets, romance scams (yes, seriously), and even blackmail threats. The Thala protocol hack last month? Scammers walked away with $25.5 million—though thankfully, the funds were recovered. These criminals know how to exploit human nature—whether it’s greed, trust, or a lack of awareness. And the holidays are their favorite time to strike as people put down their guards. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Loses in November 2024: $71M Drained as DeFi Hit Hard , What To Do?

37174887,https://invezz.com/?p=2336315,1733238693,Brazil’s Central Bank pushes for Stablecoin transfer restrictions under new regulation,"Brazil’s Central Bank, officially known as Banco Central do Brasil (BCB), took an important step by launching a public consultation that could significantly alter the landscape of bitcoin transactions in the country. This proposal is especially notable because it intends to prevent the transfer of stablecoins—cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value tied to a fiat currency, such as Tether’s USDT—to self-custody wallets, including popular platforms like MetaMask. The central bank’s draft regulation clearly states, “The virtual asset service provider is prohibited from transferring foreign currency-denominated virtual assets to a self-custody wallet.” This specific policy, part of a larger draft regulatory framework, is not an arbitrary proposal; it is now available for public consultation until February 28, 2025. With this project, the Brazilian government is taking a proactive approach to improving market monitoring, enforcing compliance, and regulating Brazilian capital outflows in a changing financial landscape. The rationale behind the regulation The reason behind these proposed laws stems from the Brazilian government’s growing desire to strengthen its control over the foreign exchange market and efficiently oversee the growing prevalence and use of stablecoins within Brazil’s borders. According to the consultation document and related statements from officials, the move would entail modifying earlier 2022 resolutions addressing providers of virtual asset services (PSAV) functioning in the foreign currency market. Beyond simply restricting stablecoin transfers, the BCB has ambitious plans to significantly broaden the definition of the foreign exchange market to include a wide range of activities such as payments, sales, custody, and a comprehensive range of cryptocurrency transactions denominated in foreign currencies. If this regulation is enacted, PSAVs will be required to provide the BCB with detailed and specific information about customer verification processes, transaction values, and a variety of other operational data deemed relevant to maintaining market integrity. The rising popularity of Stablecoins in Brazil The growing popularity of stablecoins in Brazil highlights the importance of this regulation proposal. Stablecoins, which have the potential to maintain a stable value that is tethered to a fiat currency (such as the US dollar), have grown in popularity in comparison to their more volatile cryptocurrency competitors. The recent entry of USD Coin (USDC) into the Brazilian and Mexican markets via local bank transfers, as revealed by Circle, is a striking example of this emerging trend. Circle has clearly stated that their stablecoin can now function flawlessly within the real-time payment systems developed in both countries, allowing for faster, more efficient, and more secure transactions for consumers seeking dependability in their digital transactions. The challenge of self-custody wallets In today’s cryptocurrency world, all transactions involving digital assets are subject to severe identity verification methods under the Know Your Customer (KYC) laws imposed by centralized exchanges to combat illicit financial activity. Self-custody wallets, on the other hand, offer an intriguing and contrasting scenario. These wallets provide a high level of privacy and user control, allowing individuals to manage their digital assets autonomously and without having to divulge personal information for payment transfers. This distinguishing feature of self-custody wallets is important in light of the BCB’s ongoing public consultation. While many see these wallets as an expression of financial freedom because they allow users to have complete control over their digital assets without the need for intermediaries, others argue that they represent a significant regulatory gap that could become a conduit for illicit financial activities, thwarting government oversight efforts. Reflection on global regulatory trends The BCB’s proposal is not isolated; rather, it represents a broader worldwide trend toward tighter cryptocurrency regulation, with a particular emphasis on the implications of these digital assets for domestic economies and foreign commerce. As one of Latin America’s most dynamic and rapidly evolving markets, Brazil is now working to align its cryptocurrency policies with evolving global standards, indicating a growing commitment by financial authorities to ensure market stability while adapting to the ongoing wave of digital transformation affecting financial services. As the consultation period unfolds, stakeholders—including individual crypto users, service providers, investors, and regulatory bodies—continue to pay close attention to the possible consequences of these proposed changes for the future of cryptocurrency transactions in Brazil. The eventual outcome could set a key precedent for how nations in the region address the multifaceted challenges and tremendous opportunities presented by the burgeoning cryptocurrency landscape, especially as Brazil positions itself at the forefront of this critical and ongoing conversation about cryptocurrency and regulation. Brazil’s cryptocurrency transactions at a crucial crossroads As the Brazilian Central Bank prepares to reinterpret the legislative framework governing stablecoins and the use of self-custody wallets, the future trajectory of cryptocurrency transactions in Brazil reaches a critical crossroads. As the public consultations progress, the delicate interplay between financial innovation and regulatory control will be widely monitored, not only in Brazil but also throughout the world, as other countries examine and potentially respond to Brazil’s regulatory strategy. The decisions made today may influence the contours of the cryptocurrency market for years to come, influencing how digital currencies are managed, understood, and used in the broader economic landscape, both in Brazil and elsewhere.

37174715,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=621999,1733238635,TRON (TRX) hits all-time high above $0.24 as hype rolls over from XRP,"TRON (TRX) set a new all-time high as the price peaked at $0.24, and the token appears to have claimed the hype rollover from XRP. The L1 token appreciated gradually in 2024 before its big rally. TRON (TRX) vaulted its all-time record, achieved during its early historic rally in 2017. TRX traded close to $0.24, breaking its previous records above $0.22. In the past, TRX was seen as a possible candidate for rallying above $0.50 or even to $1. TRX appreciated gradually in 2024, rewarding patient investors after years of trading under $0.10. The asset spent months in stagnation, despite claims of high activity on its chain. TRX hovered sideways, similar to other assets like XRP, Cardano (ADA), and IOTA (IOTA). The recent shift to an altcoin market revived those old coins and tokens, with a rollover of enthusiasm. As the XRP rally stalled, TRX took over with a near-vertical rally. TRX gained more than 16% overnight as the other altcoin rallies slowed down while continuing to trade upward during Asian and European trading hours. The TRX rally may also run out of steam, as other old altcoins are lining up for fast overnight gains. However, TRX is unique for being an infrastructure token, supporting one of the most active L1 chains. TRX goes for sleeper rally after years as a key utility token TRX open interest is just $160M, a relatively small figure for a token ranked 11th based on its market capitalization. TRX may be on the verge of re-joining the top 10 assets if its rally continues. TRX trading still hinges on predominantly long positions , with the potential for a price reversal. After years of accumulation, the TRX rally coincided with the official altcoin season of late 2024. The altcoin season index expanded from 73 points to above 84 points in a single day, signaling the potential of the top 100 altcoins outgaining BTC. The altcoin rally follows a shift from meme tokens. Older altcoins are also amenable to the same hype and irrational trading, especially if long-term holders are in no hurry to sell until the price moves to a new range. TRON remains a secluded ecosystem, with a focus on the Asian market. The chain turned into a top fee producer with net gains, driven by its ecosystem of apps. The most activity comes from Tether (USDT), which issued more than 61B tokens on TRON. TRX serves as the utility token to pay these transaction fees. The recent TRX rally also hints at TRON’s immunity to FUD and skepticism. Energy, USDT volume grew to a new peak The activity of the TRON network is measured by its use of ‘energy’, similar to gas on Ethereum. Energy usage reached an all-time high in the past two months, measuring a return to generally high volumes. Total transactions on TRON have recovered to levels not seen since the 2021 and 2022 bull markets. In the past weeks, those transactions have been much more consistent. The TRON network reports more than 3.2M daily active addresses, with more than 14M wallets active in the past month. USDT volumes were the main driver for TRON activity. The token is held in more than 57M wallets , a reflection of stablecoin adoption in recent times. Weekly USDT transaction volumes reached over 150B, and TRON was a leader in carrying professional investor or whale-sized transactions between $10K and $100K. Stablecoins, in addition to its DeFi sector, were one of TRON’s key use cases. TRON accrued $8.98M in total value locked, on track to break its previous peak above $10B in all lending and DEX protocols. Based on its activity as a utility L1 chain, TRON achieved more than $28M net earnings for November, even after paying out incentives to its validators. In November, TRON also received $238.42M in fees, its highest achievement over the last six months, further proof of its growing on-chain activity. TRON mostly underperformed during the meme tokens drive, losing out to Pump.fun and Solana.

37174663,https://coinpedia.org/?p=388709,1733238567,The Meme Token Leading the Next AI Trend in Crypto,"The post The Meme Token Leading the Next AI Trend in Crypto appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News They are coming. First we had AI. Now we have AI meme coins. In what is essentially a month or so, AI meme coins have exploded from their silicone womb and grown their market cap to a considerable share of the wider AI sector. Leading this charge is a coin that is quite possibly the wildest project in the sector to date . iDEGEN is an unrestrained AI agent and meme coin; not even the giganerds who built it know what it will do. Born on X, it will be raised by any degens who are ready to bring the next generation of AI memes into this world. Here’s why iDEGEN has already delivered 100,809% gains after launching its adaptive auction presale a matter of days ago. iDEGEN will rise up Tweeting every hour , iDEGEN was born as a neutral AI, and as degens interact with it, it will reflect back to its community whatever they feed it. It could spew out anything. From offensive poetry to inspirational quotes. Early outputs are already generating a lot of attention. This journey of growth is driving iDEGEN towards what the project is describing as the ‘Degen Singularity.’ A point at which iDEGEN will become autonomous and sentient. Could it start launching its own coins? Could it become the degen equivalent of Terminator and do everything in its power to nuke every meme coin in existence? We shall see. AI meme coins are rising up too The meme coin supercycle is already printing astonishing gains and AI meme coins are the latest sub-narrative to form within it. Tokens like Act I : The AI Prophecy , Zerebro , and ai16z , are killing it. With respective market caps of +$400 million, +$500 million, and +$250 million at press time, these tokens somehow rose from zero to these figures in about a month. Still, if any sector was going to smash it right now, it would be one that blends the unstoppable power of AI with the market-leading hype of meme coins. As global liquidity ramps up, prompting more appetite for risk and crypto assets, it’s hot new, low-cap sectors—possibly ones with unpredictable “risky” AI agents—that are best placed to gain. iDEGEN — a force already too advanced for presales The typical presale mechanics of fixed prices, slowly increasing throughout the presale are over. They create an artificial price that only benefits the token creators, and often gets obliterated on exchange listings once early investors dump. Instead, iDEGEN’s adaptive auction will provide iDEGEN with a price the community thinks is fair. Every 5 minutes, the price can shift. If a purchase is made, the price remains static. Two purchases in two 5-minute periods in a row, the price will increase 5%. No purchases made, the price decreases 5%. This presale has the power to cause prices to potentially run away too. There’s literally no limit on how high the presale price could go. And because it’s an auction, that price is much more likely to remain steady once IDGN hits the open market: people have essentially already agreed that’s the price they want. This makes early purchase all the more important. iDEGEN will list on 1st January, 2025. AI meme coins and the degen singularity are officially here.

Vitalik Buterin opined that user experience, security, privacy, light client consensus, and artificial intelligence represent five focus areas for Ethereum ( ETH ) wallet developers. According to a Dec. 3 blog post , Buterin is confident that wallet user experience would improve with simplified transactions across ETH layer-2s and optimized gas payments for executing swaps. He added that standardizing ETH payments and on-chain transactions with QR codes will encourage greater blockchain adoption. Buterin said builders should strengthen security using multi-signature technology and social recovery to combat bad actors and malicious activities. Social recovery within the context of account abstraction has been a major talking point for Ethereum and other decentralized networks as cryptocurrencies capture mainstream attention. You might also like: Feature Saving Ethereum from itself: Experts weigh in on Vitalik Buterin’s ‘alignment’ plan Buterin further argued that deploying zero-knowledge identity management models would also enhance wallet security. ZK technology allows users and innovators to verify information without exposing sensitive details. Also, the veteran blockchain founder proposed leveraging ZK tools to power private transfers, unlock privacy pool technology, and support off-chain data storage. Furthermore, he suggested adopting light client consensus verification and on-chain content versioning to curtail Web2 risks. Per the blog post, these features can be executed using existing resources and eventually harmonize Ether Wallet operability with future artificial intelligence interfaces, which Buterin said remained in their infancy. These more radical ideas depend on technology that is extremely immature today, and so I would not put my assets today into a wallet that relies on them. However, something like this seems to be pretty clearly the future, and so it’s worth starting to more actively explore in that direction.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. A new AI crypto, outshines XRP and Polkadot with its bullish AI-DeFi narrative and 200x upside potential, making it the top altcoin pick before Christmas. Table of Contents Intel Markets: A $0.06 altcoin primed to explode Ripple: $5 by 2025? Polkadot: 126% since last month Conclusion As 2024 comes to an end, investors are gearing up for potential end-of-year rallies. Established names like Ripple (XRP) and Polkadot (DOT) remain in focus for their stable growth and utility. However, a new contender in the market is emerging as one of the most discussed AI-DeFi cryptocurrencies. With its smart approach to crypto trading and incredible upside potential, it could be the best crypto to invest in this season. Intel Markets: A $0.06 altcoin primed to explode Intel Markets is a relatively new entrant to the market with a unique offering. Intel Markets combines elements of blockchain, artificial intelligence, and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) in its cutting-edge platform. Its platform also comes with advanced AI-driven trading tools and self-adaptive learning bots. This game-changing integration positions INTL as the leader of the next market cycle. Intel Markets is currently available for purchase in its presale. The token is available for purchase for $0.06. Furthermore, Intel Markets has proved its name by attracting more than $2.5m in backing during its past six presale phases. INTL could also reach a much higher 200x once listed on tier-one exchanges compared to the growth of leading cryptocurrencies such as Ripple’s XRP and Polkadot. In addition to the presale performance, the impressive opportunity to revolutionize the crypto trading market using artificial intelligence solutions strengthens Intel Markets’ case. Both giant retails and institutions are rushing to get on board this viral altcoin, making this the single most attractive buy of the season. You might also like: XRP trends down while SHIB and Intel Markets lead weekly gains with 40% rally Ripple: $5 by 2025? Ripple is the first crypto to use blockchain technology to facilitate cross-border payments. However, XRP had years filled with challenges because of the legal battle with the SEC. In August 2024, a federal judge ordered Ripple Labs to pay a $125 million penalty for the unregistered sale of XRP tokens, a figure significantly lower than the $2 billion initially sought by the SEC. Furthermore, in October 2024, the SEC dropped all remaining claims against Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, and co-founder, Chris Larsen. Together with general market bullish sentiment, these events have prompted XRP’s price to skyrocket to $2.35, which is an impressive 360% increase since last month. Ripple proved its strength to move forward overcoming all these barriers. XRP may be trading at $5 or higher by year-end, offering modest gains. However, compared to Intel Markets’ 200x potential, XRP’s limited upside might not be as attractive to high-growth-focused investors. Polkadot: 126% since last month Polkadot is known for providing some of the first and best solutions regarding cross-blockchain communication. It has quickly gained popularity among developers working on decentralized applications, also known as dApps. DOT is currently priced at $8.85, a 126% increase since last month. Despite this, Polkadot is still down significantly since its ATH of $55 reached in 2021. In the coming months, Polkadot should be able to rise closer to the high of $10, but due to its massive market cap and current price level, it’s unlikely to have the same sort of growth as some of the other altcoins. Investors seeking major returns may find more promise in emerging altcoins like Intel Markets. Conclusion Ripple and Polkadot remain top cryptos with steady growth trajectories, but their limited upside potential pales compared to Intel Markets. As the most promising AI crypto on the market, INTL is primed for explosive gains, making it a promising altcoin to invest in before Christmas.

37178359,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=103768,1733238064,Expert Predicts VeChain to Claim a New ATH of $0.63,"Amid the ongoing VeChain (VET) uptrend, a prominent market commentator expects further price growth to at least double the 2021 all-time high. Notably, VeChain (VET) has captivated the market with an impressive rally so far in December, surging by nearly 40% within the first three days of this month.This uptick follows its outstanding 116% rally in November, making VET one of the best performers of the month. Despite a retracement from a multi-year peak today, VET maintains the $0.06 level. As a result, analysts expect more upside in the coming weeks.Market watcher EGRAG has forecasted that VET could potentially climb by 3,000% in the next 100 days. He based his prediction on patterns from VET’s price action, which mirrors its previous market cycles. VET in a Bullish PhaseAccording to the accompanying weekly chart, VET appears to have entered a bullish phase. The chart outlines important features that support EGRAG's bullish outlook.For context, last year, VET broke out of a prolonged descending channel, which spanned several years. This breakout indicated a shift in momentum. A key milestone was the Break of Structure (BOS), a bullish signal marked by the breakout above prior resistance levels.Notably, following this breakout, VET leveraged the first phase of the bull run to hit a peak of $0.055 in February 2024. However, as the market corrected, VeChain witnessed a massive 65% from the $0.055 peak, reaching a low of $0.01890 in August 2024. VeChain 1W Chart | EGRAG Crypto Interestingly, this decline mirrored a similar drop in VET’s past market cycles, as identified by EGRAG. In these previous cycles, the drop preceded a strong rally. EGRAG believes VeChain will replicate the bullish pattern from the previous cycles in the ongoing season.Notably, since the 65% drop, the asset has embarked on an upward trajectory, reclaiming a two-year peak of $0.0720 this month. This has bolstered the market analyst’s conviction that VeChain will witness more substantial price growth.VeChain Fibonacci TargetsFor when this price growth materializes, EGRAG outlines Fibonacci levels, which serve as potential price targets for VET. With VeChain now trading for $0.06134, the first target, at Fib 0.5 ($0.06021), has already been surpassed.From this position, the next levels of interest being Fib 0.702 ($0.11147) and Fib 1.0 ($0.27651). However, the most ambitious targets are the Fibonacci extensions: Fib 1.272 ($0.63) and Fib 1.618 ($1.58).EGRAG stressed that a 3,000% surge from current levels would place VET near the Fib 1.272 level, doubling its previous ATH of $0.2798 from April 2021. Several factors also contribute to the optimistic outlook for VET. VeChain’s inclusion in Coinbase’s COIN50 Index is a major milestone. This development bolsters VET’s visibility to institutional and retail investors.Additionally, VeChain’s strong partnerships and real-world utility add to its appeal. The blockchain platform has established itself as a leader in supply chain solutions and continues to expand its use cases, solidifying its long-term value proposition.",POSITIVE,VET,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | VET,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/03/expert-predicts-vechain-to-claim-a-new-ath-of-0-63/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=expert-predicts-vechain-to-claim-a-new-ath-of-0-63,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

CryptoQuant CEO X shared on his account that this altcoin season will be unusual and challenging, and only a few select altcoins will be successful. Ju said that while market sentiment is positive, there is limited fresh liquidity. Stating that Bitcoin is increasingly moving away from the wider crypto ecosystem, the famous CEO stated that liquidity has not shifted to altcoins due to ETFs, MicroStrategy (MSTR) and various funds. Noting that altcoins once moved in correlation with Bitcoin, this correlation has now been broken, Ju said that only a few altcoins are attracting new liquidity and altcoins in general have started to move independently of BTC. “This alt season will not be what you expect. It will be strange and difficult. Only a select few altcoins will succeed in this rally. Market sentiment is good, but there is not much fresh liquidity. Altcoins used to move together based on their correlation with BTC, but this pattern has now broken. Altcoins now have two options: create wrapped versions like Bitcoin or establish a true internet money ecosystem using stablecoins or BTC.

Both daily and weekly chart patterns display bullish formations. The recent surge has pushed INJ above the $3 billion market cap threshold. If INJ manages to sustain this level, it could turn the $30 level as the next potential support. The introduction of AI-powered burn auctions represents a key step in Injective’s tokenomics strategy. This approach allows community members to directly participate in the token burn process, creating a more democratic and engaged ecosystem. The weekly burn schedule, facilitated by iAgent technology, establishes a predictable mechanism for supply reduction while maintaining community involvement. Burn activities are generally carried out by projects that plan to reduce the circulating supply. This action helps in driving up demand as the supply reduces. INJ price surges following launch INJ has exhibited decent gains in different timeframes, with the price currently trading at $31.3 after a 13% surge in the last 24 hours. INJ’s momentum is particularly evident in its longer-term performance metrics, showing gains of 18.5% over seven days and an 84.9% monthly appreciation. The token maintains strong trading activity within a seven-day range of $27.48 to $32.83, though it remains 38.9% below its March 14 all-time high of $52.62.

37174561,https://cryptonews.com/?p=315664,1733237216,Coinbase Sparks PNUT Listing Speculation with Apple Pay Tutorial,"Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT), a viral meme coin, was recently featured in a Coinbase tutorial video for its new Apple Pay integration, fueling speculation of a potential Coinbase listing. The 15-second video prominently featured the PNUT token, sparking excitement among crypto enthusiasts that it might soon be listed on a cryptocurrency exchange. Spotlight on PNUT: Did Coinbase Just Tease Its Next Big Listing? On December 2, Coinbase announced the full integration of Apple Pay into its Onramp app services. The integration, which requires no action from app developers, is now live for all users. The addition is designed to streamline fiat-to-crypto conversions, making the process faster and more user-friendly. Coinbase created the above 15-second video introducing its new product to its audience. In the final seconds of Coinbase’s tutorial video, the iPhone screen prominently displays Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) as the top trending token under the “spotlight” tag. The video also reveals PNUT’s price page, featuring a glowing green chart showing upward momentum. So $PNUT has been featured on Coinbase’s new Apple Pay tutorial https://t.co/FdjX0XwycH https://t.co/OknZlCtSo3 pic.twitter.com/u8hOydo5ZQ — MoneyLord (@moneyl0rd) December 3, 2024 This subtle detail did not go unnoticed by traders on X (formerly Twitter), who quickly interpreted it as a potential hint of an upcoming Coinbase listing for PNUT. “List Coinbase soon. PNUT $30B $50B,” one user commented . The token’s price has surged in recent days, reflecting the growing hype. According to data from Coinmarketcap, PNUT has risen by nearly 12% in the past 24 hours, 11.3% over the past week, and an astounding 981.41% in the past month. The token currently has a market capitalization and a fully diluted valuation of $1.2 billion. Apple Pay, which has over 60 million active users in the United States and more than 500 million globally as of 2023, will significantly expand accessibility for Coinbase users. Coinbase Tease Fuels Hype: Could FRED Join PNUT in the Crypto Spotlight? In addition to PNUT, traders noticed the inclusion of another Solana-based meme coin in the tutorial video. This sibling token, named First Convicted Raccoon (FRED), pays tribute to Fred the raccoon, Peanut’s viral internet counterpart. Some traders believe this could also indicate a potential Coinbase listing for FRED. One trader wrote on social media, “The possibility of #Fred being listed on Coinbase excites me more. If Moodeng is listed, #Fred is not a dream.” PNUT and FRED, Solana-based meme coins , were launched in November to commemorate Peanut the Squirrel and Fred the Raccoon. The pair gained internet fame through an Instagram account run by Mark Longo, who rescued Peanut after a car accident. However, their story took a tragic turn when the New York City Department of Environmental Conservation confiscated the animals following anonymous complaints. The department allegedly euthanized Peanut and Fred, sparking public outrage and criticism of government overreach. Among the critics was Elon Musk, who weighed in on the situation. The crypto community responded by creating these meme coins as a tribute to the two iconic animals, ensuring their legacy lives on in digital form.

Moreover, the comments from Tron founder Justin Sun on X have further triggered discussions in the market, particularly after the remarkable XR rally. Lets find out what it is. In a series of X posts , Justin Sun has compared TRX with Ripple’s XRP and called TRX the ‘next XRP’ which has caught the eyes of the crypto community. In a separate post, he again duplicated a similar sentiment and said “TRX=XRP”. This comparison with XRP, which has recently witnessed massive rallies, has fueled discussions in the broader crypto market. The rally of over 15% in TON’s price has captured the eyes of investors today. Various factors could have contributed to the recent gains in the crypto’s price. The recent shift towards the altcoins and the rising institutional and retail interest might have led to the gains. Also, TRX recently broke $20 billion in market cap. Its one-day trading volume has skyrocketed a massive 116% to $2.49 billion. It is up 23% over the last seven days while witnessing a monthly surge of around 44%. Will TRON Follow XRP? XRP recently made it to the top 3 list of cryptocurrencies by surpassing Tether in market cap. It witnessed massive gains over 80% in the past week. Also, XRP price was one of the top-performing assets in the digital assets space last month. Moreover, a flurry of positive developments of Ripple, including Gary Gensler’s resignation news, XRP lawsuit advancements, XRP ETF filings by top players, and others, might have contributed to the recent gains. XRP’s resurgence follows years of consolidation driven by the extended Ripple-SEC lawsuit, which restricted its price trajectory until now. Meanwhile, TRX has shown steady growth over the years, surpassing its 2021 high of $0.184. Technical Patterns Align These technical breakout patterns align with Sun’s optimistic outlook, indicating that TRX may mirror XRP’s growth trajectory. TRX is now setting its sights on its all-time high of $0.30, a milestone that could validate its long-term bullish possibility. Therefore, the comparison has not only gained investors’ attention but has also sparked discussions among investors if the Tron price would follow the same path as XRP, especially with Sun’s recent X posts.",POSITIVE,TRX | XRP,ALTCOIN | MARKET | TRADING | TRX | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/justin-calls-trx-the-next-xrp-will-trx-follow-xrps-price-trajectory/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37174206,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=25813,1733237099,World’s 1st Live-Bull traded on the Solana Blockchain through RWA Platform Agridex,"AgriDex facilitated the trade of a rare White Park Bull, purchased by a private buyer from Aurox Meats . A picture of the first bull to be traded on Solana AgriDex , a Solana-based real-world assets (RWA) marketplace and winner of the Stand With Crypto UK’s ‘Best Use Case’ Awards , made history this week by facilitating the world’s first trade of a live bull on the blockchain from Aurox Meats . The transaction was seamlessly executed through the AgriDex platform and recorded on the Solana blockchain. The bull comes from Gatcombe Park, the Princess Royal’s herd. The White Park bull, Dinefwr Wyn, carries a lineage steeped in royal heritage, traced back to some of the most renowned bloodlines in the breed’s history. “This historic transaction isn’t just bullish for Solana, it’s bullish for the entire global livestock market. AgriDex demonstrates how blockchain can bring greater accountability to the livestock trade, empowering farmers and suppliers while ensuring animal welfare standards are maintained,” said Henry Duckworth , Co-Founder and CEO of AgriDex. The Future of Solana Depends on Utility Memecoins may be fun, but Solana needs substance. While the blockchain’s speed, low fees, and scalability have fueled an explosion of memecoins, capturing retail traders and driving community engagement, the long-term health of the ecosystem depends on more than fleeting hype. Real-World Assets (RWA) present a transformative alternative and offer sustainable growth and real-world value. In early 2024, RWA emerged as the second most profitable crypto narrative , delivering an impressive 285.6% return. For a brief moment in February, it even surpassed memecoins. RWA has been gaining further popularity and is emerging as one of the main narratives of the upcoming bull run. AgriDex leverages the power of Solana’s blockchain to revolutionise livestock trading with transparency, efficiency, and fairness. By ensuring every transaction is fully trackable, the platform reduces fraud and price manipulation across global supply chains. Its near-instant settlements come with significantly lower fees—just 0.15% per trade side—compared to traditional methods that often charge several percentage points and take 4-6 days to settle transactions. The successful facilitation of the trade on the blockchain showcases AgriDex’s commitment to innovation and highlights its role as a platform driving the adoption of blockchain for agricultural and livestock trades globally. As illustrated in the graph below, the project is expected to generate 133 million in profit by the end of 2028. Source: AgriDex Revolutionalise the agricultural industry with blockchain Set to launch on December 4th , Agridex is revolutionising the $2.3 trillion global agricultural trade industry by tokenising the supply chain. AgriDex offers farmers instant settlements, drastically reduced transaction costs, and fraud-proof traceability using blockchain and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to enshrine legal contracts. The AgriDex Token ($AGRI) is launching at a valuation of $65 million and anticipates generating $53.28 million in trading fees by the end of 2026, supported by an expected net buy pressure of $39.2 million within two years. Blockchain technology is undeniably redefining the tech paradigm, but many have jumped on the trend solely for profit, often not solving a real-world problem. AgriDex, however, stands apart by delivering genuine utility, leveraging blockchain to drive meaningful impact and innovation in the agricultural sector. For instance, food fraud cost the UK £1.96 billion in 2021 and globally accounts for $30-40 Billion dollars in lost revenue. Food fraud is notoriously hard to detect with only 20% of suspected cases being reported. In the UK, of the 610 that were reported in 2021 there were only 16 successful prosecutions, or under 4%. Poor traceability and certificate verification The fraud highlighted above is enabled by the opacity of crossing multiple jurisdictions using wet contracts and poor visibility of origin for consumers. Dozens of different standards and certifications make it challenging to assure quality, origin and sustainability credentials. Source: AgriDex AgriDex solves the problem by providing an inclusive marketplace for all participants in the supply chain. It is driven by the immutable ledger of blockchain – that delivers trust, transparency, and accountability. The RWA platform built on Solana lowers the cost of food traded through it, increases choice, and delivers transparency, reducing fraud and verifying quality and origin and sustainability credentials. It is focused on solving critical issues with trading agricultural products and services including inefficiency, fraud, access to finance and insurance. AgriDex will create a fair and transparent financial system. The graph below illustrates the significant cost and time savings that AgriDex offers • Cost Savings: While traditional systems incur a cost of $1,125 per tonne of cocoa, AgriDex slashes this to just $660, highlighting a stark reduction in trade expenses. • Time Efficiency: Traditionally, such a transaction takes 65 days to complete, but with AgriDex, it’s cut down to 40 days. This accelerated timeline demonstrates AgriDex’sefficiency. Source: AgriDex AgriDex is redefining the global agricultural trade industry by leveraging blockchain technology to create a transparent, efficient, and fraud-resistant marketplace. By reducing costs, cutting transaction times, and providing traceable records of quality, origin, and sustainability, the RWA platform on Solana addresses critical inefficiencies in the $2.3 trillion agricultural sector. As the first platform to successfully trade a live bull on Solana, AgriDex showcases the transformative potential of RWAs and sets a new standard for using blockchain to solve real-world problems, driving meaningful innovation and sustainable growth in agriculture.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | SOL | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/worlds-1st-live-bull-traded-on-the-solana-blockchain-through-rwa-platform-agridex/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37174886,https://invezz.com/?p=2336438,1733236914,Could quantum computing disrupt cryptocurrency encryption?,"Quantum computing, an emerging technology that operates on principles of quantum mechanics, has sparked discussions about its potential impact on cryptocurrency security. With unparalleled computational power, quantum computers could eventually challenge the cryptographic protocols that underpin digital currencies, though such capabilities remain years away. How quantum computing differs from classical technology Quantum computers leverage qubits—quantum bits that can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement. Unlike classical computers, which process data in binary (0 or 1), quantum systems can perform complex calculations exponentially faster. For example, Grover’s algorithm and Shor’s algorithm are theoretical quantum tools that could transform problem-solving in cryptography. Grover’s algorithm could reduce the time needed to mine cryptocurrency, while Shor’s algorithm might efficiently decrypt private keys, exposing digital wallets to unauthorized access. Potential implications for cryptocurrency Encryption vulnerabilities: Cryptocurrencies rely on public and private key encryption to secure transactions and maintain trust. These keys are generated using mathematical functions that are nearly impossible for classical computers to reverse-engineer. However, with quantum computing and cryptocurrency increasingly becoming intertwined in discussions about future risks, quantum algorithms could feasibly break these encryptions, threatening the very foundation of blockchain security. For instance, Shor’s algorithm could unravel private keys from public ones, effectively granting bad actors access to funds and transactions. This potential vulnerability is a critical concern for the cryptocurrency industry. Mining power imbalance: Quantum computers could also disrupt the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency mining. Mining rewards those who solve computational puzzles first, validating transactions on the blockchain. The speed and efficiency of quantum machines could allow those with access to dominate mining operations, centralizing power and undermining the core ethos of cryptocurrencies. Current state of quantum computing: While the theoretical threats are significant, quantum computing remains in its developmental stage. Current systems are error-prone and highly sensitive to external factors such as temperature and radiation. These challenges limit their practical applications for now. Moreover, quantum computers are accessible primarily to research institutions and tech companies, with mass deployment still a decade or more away. Until quantum machines become scalable and reliable, their real-world implications for cryptocurrency security remain speculative. Cryptocurrency’s response to quantum risks Recognizing the potential risks, the cryptocurrency industry is taking proactive steps to prepare for a quantum future. Developers are exploring quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms, such as lattice-based cryptography and hash-based signatures, which are designed to withstand quantum attacks. In addition, some projects are already working on quantum-resistant blockchains. These initiatives aim to future-proof digital assets by incorporating encryption techniques that remain secure even against advanced quantum computations. Looking ahead Quantum computing represents both an opportunity and a challenge for the tech world, including cryptocurrencies. While the technology’s potential to disrupt current encryption standards is significant, its practical implementation is still years away. In the meantime, the cryptocurrency sector is evolving to mitigate these risks, ensuring that blockchain systems remain secure. The interplay between quantum computing advancements and cryptographic innovations will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of decentralized finance and digital security.

Tron has performed incredibly well over the past few weeks. As of November 3, TRX was priced at $0.1598 per token. The token has witnessed a 50.93% spike since then to a new all-time high (ATH) record of $0.2412, according to data from CoinGecko. Prior to this new record, Tron’s previous all-time high was registered in June 2018, when its price surged to $0.22. However, the token waited over six years before it finally set a new record of $0.2412. This milestone follows a multi-week rally that began on November 12. Tron’s price surged 12.72% at the time, soaring from $0.1658 to $0.1869. Afterward, Tron registered slight gains until December 3, when it witnessed its biggest daily increase of 16.2%. This rally pushed TRX’s price to the new ATH of $0.2412. Massive Whale Activity The development comes shortly after the asset witnessed a spike in whale activity. On December 2, data from IntoTheBlock showed that large transactions worth at least $100,000 spiked 195.90% in 24 hours to 722 from the previous day's record of 244. Interestingly, the total TRX traded within this period amounted to 2.04 billion tokens, representing a surge of 238.63% from the 602.42 million TRX volume on December 1. It is worth noting that an increase in whale activity typically drives up retail demand for the asset. 100% Tron Addresses See Profit Although Tron has retraced slightly from its peak price to $0.2358, all addresses holding TRX in on-chain wallets are currently in profit. IntoTheBlock’s Global In/Out of Money (GIOM) indicator shows that 159.35 million addresses, representing 100% of all Tron on-chain addresses, are in the money. Tron GIOM Indicator Amid the price surge, Tron’s market cap also increased to $20.9 billion today, marking a new ATH valuation for the asset. Despite retracing to $20.57 billion, Tron still ranks as the 12th biggest cryptocurrency on CoinGecko, ahead of Toncoin (TON), which boasts a market cap of $16.77 billion.",POSITIVE,TRX | TON,MARKET | TRADING | TRX | TON,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/03/tron-price-hits-new-ath-above-0-24-breaks-its-2018-record/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=tron-price-hits-new-ath-above-0-24-breaks-its-2018-record,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Donald vs Israel (DONISRA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONISRA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Donald vs Israel can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald vs Israel could become the next viral memecoin. Donald vs Israel launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Donald vs Israel on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald vs Israel by entering its contract address – CKYA6Q1KcWsSJyXgFKwyNXyTAjHD1dRPKTDD2FTUFryn – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONISRA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/new-solana-memecoin-donald-vs-israel-donisra-will-skyrocket-16000-before-exchange-listings/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Why You Should Be Excited About That?,"Not long ago, the world of trading bots felt almost stagnant—lacking innovation, fresh ideas, and originality. Many of the products on the market carried over the same flaws, and in some cases, those issues were only amplified. Ongoing challenges include outdated systems, overly complicated interfaces, and monetization strategies that often disappoint users. In a thriving market with so much potential, it's frustrating to see such missed opportunities. However, we recently came across the FATTY project, which is gearing up to launch FatBot—a game-changing addition to their ecosystem designed to tackle these long-standing issues head-on. FatBot Launch is Just Around the Corner FatBot , the innovative trading bot from the FATTY ecosystem, is on its way and poised to revolutionize crypto trading. Built with cutting-edge features and user-first design, this bot is already making waves before its official launch. But why all the excitement? The first thing to know about FatBot is that it’s a solution to the biggest pain points traders face today. Many existing bots struggle with outdated systems, confusing interfaces, and monetization strategies that often leave users unsatisfied. FatBot changes that narrative by delivering a streamlined experience that’s as easy to navigate as it is effective. One of its most exciting features is Sniping 2.0—a groundbreaking tool leagues ahead of traditional sniping bots. While other bots often rely on basic, one-size-fits-all executions, FatBot allows traders to set detailed, personalized trade criteria. This could mean significantly higher returns for traders in fast-moving markets, especially those chasing the next big memecoin. And for those that haven't heard about FATTY and FatBot before, you'll have to know that it isn’t just an overnight idea—it’s the product of a year-long development process led by CleevioX, a team with experience in building one of the current top 5 trading bots. By joining Moon5 Labs, the development team has ensured that FatBot is equipped with advanced technology and the reliability traders need in a competitive market. More Than a Trading Bot But while FatBot currently is a focal point, remember that the FATTY ecosystem is not only reshaping how trading bots function but also delivering a host of benefits through its native token, which is quickly becoming a valuable asset in its own right. The ongoing $FATTY token presale has already raised $5.6 million, proving that confidence in the ecosystem is surging. Early supporters aren't just backing a concept—they're investing in an ecosystem designed to generate value for its holders. Currently, tokens are priced at an enticing $0.025, and once the presale ends, the price will increase to $0.030. Now is the time when the project is giving early adopters a significant advantage. Also, $FATTY has a unique utility. The token doesn't just exist as a store of value; it actively empowers its holders through revenue-sharing benefits. Half of all fees collected within the ecosystem are redistributed to token holders in ETH and SOL, creating a passive income stream that rewards long-term investors. Additionally, holding $FATTY tokens gives traders a competitive edge when using FatBot. The Sniping 2.0 feature, widely praised for its precision, becomes even more powerful for those holding larger amounts of $FATTY. Trades' execution speed improves with higher token holdings, giving investors a clear advantage in high-stakes, fast-paced markets. Participating in the $FATTY presale is straightforward, with multiple payment options available, including popular cryptocurrencies like ETH, USDT, and BNB, as well as Visa and Mastercard. Whether you're drawn by the promise of FatBot or intrigued by the revenue-sharing potential of $FATTY, now is the time to act. The ecosystem is poised to deliver big things, and being part of it early could pay off in ways that go beyond just trading profits. The countdown to FatBot has started—so don't miss your chance to be a part of the future of crypto trading.

37174016,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373278,1733236387,BTC Price Slips Below $94K Amid Warnings About a Crash to $90K or Even $60K,"TL:DR; Bitcoin’s price has seen better days as the asset failed at $97,500 yesterday and has lost nearly four grand since then. This comes on the heels of several analysts predicting a further correction that will potentially drive bitcoin to under $90,000. Sub-$90K Coming Soon? The primary cryptocurrency entered uncharted territory once Donald Trump won the US elections nearly a month ago by shooting above $74,000. The following ten days or so were nothing short of spectacular as the asset flew past several other round-numbered milestones and peaked on November 22 at just over $99,800. However, it failed to reach the coveted six-digit territory and was pushed south almost immediately. Within days, it had dumped to under $91,000, but the bulls came out to play and helped it recover most of its losses. As such, bitcoin jumped above $98,000 last Friday but failed to keep up its momentum and started to lose value gradually. It faced some enhanced volatility yesterday and went through another correction today. Just hours ago, the cryptocurrency dumped below $94,000 for the first time in almost a week, leaving $580 million in liquidations. Several well-known crypto analysts expect even more pain for BTC. As summarized by Ali, Sheldon_Sniper and Tone Vays have both warned the community about a potential pullback to below $90,000. Furthermore, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, as well as Robert Kiyosaki, anticipate a massive crash that will drive the asset to $60,000. Nevertheless, both remain optimistic about BTC’s long-term potential, with price targets of up to $250,000. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 3.12.2024. Source: TradingView The Opposite More Likely? Ali further highlighted Santiment data showing that the crowd agrees with the aforementioned warnings, with the number of “BTC pullback” mentions skyrocketing. The analyst said that such predictions cannot be taken lightly but outlined another possibility. Bitcoin typically heads in the opposite direction of what others expect. As such, Ali noted that the asset could jump a lot higher to $120,000 or even $150,000 before a real massive correction of 30% transpires. Given the fact that #Bitcoin tends to do the opposite of what the crowd believes, there is potential for $BTC to go higher. If the current cycle behaves like the last two, #BTC could go to $120,000-$150,000 before the first 30% price correction. https://t.co/xTHJMITqJa — Ali (@ali_charts) December 2, 2024 The post BTC Price Slips Below $94K Amid Warnings About a Crash to $90K or Even $60K appeared first on CryptoPotato .",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | TRADING,,0,0,Crypto Potato,https://cryptopotato.com/btc-price-slips-below-94k-amid-warnings-about-a-crash-to-90k-or-even-60k/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/37174016.jpeg

37174297,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24510,1733236329,What Do You Need to know About the Celo Migration?,"Celo’s transition from a Layer 1 blockchain to an Ethereum Layer 2 represents a significant step forward, leveraging Ethereum’s OP Stack to enhance scalability, security, and interoperability. This migration aims to preserve Celo’s key features, such as low transaction fees, fast settlement times, and social payment functionality, while integrating with Ethereum’s ecosystem. Key milestones in the process include testnet launches like Dango and Alfajores, which allow developers and node operators to adapt to the new environment. Despite some initial resistance, the Celo community remains focused on completing the transition by early 2025, positioning itself as an accessible and secure platform for real-world blockchain applications. From Layer 1 Chain to Ethereum Layer 2 The Celo blockchain is transitioning from its standalone Layer 1 (L1) design to becoming an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) solution within Optimism’s Superchain ecosystem . This strategic migration, which began with planning in 2023, aims to leverage Ethereum’s robust security and interoperability while maintaining Celo’s hallmark features, such as low transaction fees and fast processing times. The shift aligns Celo more closely with Ethereum’s ecosystem, fostering deeper collaboration and innovation. The migration is being executed through a series of testnets, such as Alfajores and Baklava, which are designed to prepare developers, node operators, and validators for the eventual mainnet transition scheduled for January 2025. A key technical benefit of the migration is the introduction of native bridging between Celo and Ethereum, significantly enhancing the security and efficiency of asset transfers by reducing reliance on external bridges, which have historically posed risks. Additionally, the new L2 infrastructure will increase Celo’s throughput, decrease block times, and maintain features like one-block finality and fee abstraction for seamless user interactions. By adopting the OP Stack, Celo ensures compatibility with other L2 solutions in the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling a more unified blockchain network. get started with celo However, the transition has not been without challenges. One major exchange recently announced that it would not initially support Celo’s migration, citing operational complexities. This decision sparked criticism from the Celo community, with calls for reconsideration due to the migration’s importance to Ethereum’s broader scaling roadmap. In contrast, other industry players have expressed full support for the migration, demonstrating the mixed reactions and uncertainties surrounding the process. The migration represents a pivotal moment for Celo, not only as a technical upgrade but also as a significant realignment within the blockchain landscape. As Celo moves to solidify its position within Ethereum’s scaling ecosystem, the success of this migration could serve as a model for other L1 chains considering similar transitions. The outcome of Celo’s move to L2 will likely influence its adoption, utility, and role in the evolving decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain space. Celo After the Migration Will Be Available to Bitfinex Traders Celo’s upcoming transition to an Ethereum Layer 2 within the Optimism Superchain ecosystem has sparked varying reactions from industry stakeholders. While some said they would not support the migration, Bitfinex continues to facilitate access to Celo markets. Bitfinex traders will retain the ability to participate in Celo trading, ensuring that customers on the platform can engage with the token even as it transitions to a Layer 2 solution. This decision underscores the diversity of perspectives among exchanges and highlights how platforms differ in their approach to supporting evolving blockchain projects. A notable aspect of Celo’s migration is the strong backing from Tether , the issuer of the world’s most widely used stablecoin, USDt. Tether has affirmed its commitment to supporting Celo’s transition, signaling confidence in the project’s potential to enhance scalability and security through its integration with Ethereum. By maintaining USDt as a viable option for transaction fees and payments within the Celo ecosystem, Tether plays a critical role in ensuring continuity for users and developers during and after the migration process. This backing provides a layer of stability for Celo users, particularly those relying on USDt for seamless transfers and decentralized applications. Tether’s support also reflects its broader strategy of aligning with innovative blockchain initiatives that promote scalability and accessibility. As Celo integrates into the Optimism Superchain, Tether’s involvement helps reinforce the project’s objectives of enabling fast, low-cost transactions and expanding adoption across global markets. Additionally, the dual use of USDt and other Celo-native assets as gas currencies demonstrates a commitment to flexibility and user-friendly operations, a key advantage as the platform evolves into a more interoperable solution. While Coinbase’s decision introduces certain challenges, Tether’s endorsement and Bitfinex’s continued market access mitigate potential disruptions for the Celo community. These developments reflect a broader trend of decentralized networks receiving varying degrees of support as they adapt to changing technological landscapes. For Celo, the backing of a major stablecoin provider like Tether and the ongoing availability of trading on platforms like Bitfinex provide a strong foundation to navigate its transition successfully, maintaining user trust and developer engagement in the process. get started with celo Why the Decision to Switch to an Ethereum Layer 2? Celo began its journey as an independent Layer 1 blockchain in 2020, designed with a mobile-first approach to enable fast, low-cost payments and broaden access to Decentralized Finance (DeFi) worldwide. Leveraging proof-of-stake consensus and compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), Celo carved a niche for itself in emerging markets and among developers seeking to build scalable financial applications. The platform’s unique features included the ability to use phone numbers as wallet addresses and fee abstraction, which allowed users to pay transaction fees with stablecoins like cUSD instead of the native CELO token. These innovations positioned Celo as a versatile blockchain tailored for real-world use cases, particularly in regions underserved by traditional financial systems. Despite its success as a standalone Layer 1, Celo faced growing challenges as the blockchain landscape evolved. The rapid expansion of Ethereum’s ecosystem and the proliferation of Layer 2 solutions highlighted the limitations of operating as an independent chain. Developers increasingly gravitated toward Ethereum’s network effects, and concerns over security, interoperability, and scalability prompted Celo to reevaluate its strategy. External bridges used for cross-chain transactions emerged as potential vulnerabilities, raising the stakes for platforms like Celo to ensure user trust and robust infrastructure. These factors fueled discussions within the Celo community and led to the decision to migrate to a Layer 2 model atop Ethereum. The transition to becoming an Ethereum Layer 2 chain was seen as a natural progression for Celo, given its longstanding commitment to Ethereum compatibility. By leveraging the Optimism Superchain’s OP Stack, Celo aimed to integrate more deeply into Ethereum’s ecosystem while maintaining its hallmark features, such as low fees and rapid transaction times. The move would enable native bridging between Celo and Ethereum, addressing security concerns tied to external bridges and providing a seamless user experience. Additionally, the migration aligns Celo with Ethereum’s thriving developer community, unlocking new opportunities for collaboration and innovation while ensuring Celo remains competitive in the rapidly evolving digital asset market. The decision to migrate to an Ethereum Layer 2 reflects an industry trend where projects increasingly converge around Ethereum’s network for its robust infrastructure and widespread adoption. For Celo, this shift represents a strategic alignment with Ethereum while preserving its original mission of enabling global financial inclusion. By transitioning to a Layer 2 solution, Celo not only enhances its scalability and security but also positions itself to capitalize on Ethereum’s ongoing advancements, ensuring its relevance and growth in the rapidly advancing Web3 ecosystem.

37173950,https://crypto.news/?p=14315819,1733236183,Missed the XRP price surge? 3 old-school crypto to consider,"Ripple has emerged as one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in this bull run, jumping by almost 500% from its lowest level in November. Ripple’s ( XRP ) jump has triggered a strong rally among many old-school cryptocurrencies that performed well in 2021. Here are some of the top coins to watch now that the altcoin season index has risen to 88. VeChain | VET VeChain ( VET ) was one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in 2021, soaring to $0.27. Like other old-school coins, it plunged during the crypto winter and has not recovered fully. VeChain has traded between the support at $0.015 and resistance at $0.055 for nearly three years. It formed a triple-bottom pattern at $0.015, which is one of the most bullish patterns in the market. VET has now rallied above the triple-bottom’s neckline at $0.5546 and the 78.6% retracement point at $0.061. It has also moved above the 50-week moving average, indicating that bulls are in control. Therefore, the VeChain token could rise to the 50% retracement at $0.1413, which is about 115% above the current level. A drop below the support at $0.050 would invalidate the bullish outlook. VET price chart | source: crypto.news Zilliqa | ZIL Zilliqa ( ZIL ) is another crypto to watch during this bull run. Like VeChain, it is an old-school coin that gained popularity for introducing sharding technology. Sharding is used by blockchains like Near Protocol and MultiversX to improve performance by breaking blocks into smaller shards. On the weekly chart, the ZIL token has bounced back, rising over the last five consecutive weeks. It has reached its highest level since April 1 and moved above the 50-week moving average. Zilliqa’s Relative Strength Index has climbed to 70, indicating strong momentum. Therefore, the coin will likely continue rising, with the next target being $0.1, the 61.8% retracement level. Zilliqa price chart | source: crypto.news JasmyCoin | JASMY JasmyCoin ( JASMY ), commonly referred to as Japan’s Bitcoin, is another cryptocurrency to consider due to its strong momentum. On the daily chart, it has formed a cup-and-handle pattern, characterized by a rounded bottom, which is one of the most bullish market patterns. The coin has also formed a golden cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages crossed each other. Additionally, the MACD indicator continues to rise, signaling strong momentum. The outlook for Jasmy remains bullish, with the next target at $0.0720. This aligns with the cup’s depth and the distance from its upper side.

When pressed about crypto tax reform and crypto ETFs (exchange-traded funds), the warhawk prime minister questioned whether people should be encouraged at all to invest in such assets, resulting in anger from opposition parties. Citing a 2024 plan by the Financial Services Agency (FSA) to “reexamine” the topic of crypto, the leader of Japan’s Democratic Party for the People (DPP), Yuichiro Tamaki , said on X he wants “Prime Minister Ishiba to listen to the voice of the people.” As a public presence pushing for tax reform in Japan — where one can be taxed an astounding 55% on cryptocurrency profits (counted as miscellaneous income) — Tamaki is frustrated with the cold and presumptive remarks Ishiba made on Monday about taxation and ETFs (exchange-traded funds). His concerns are escalated by more and more people getting into crypto in Japan , with even the FSA acknowledging it. Ishiba uninterested, questions whether public should even invest At a plenary session of the House of Representatives on Monday, Japanese PM and defense budget expansionist Shigeru Ishiba doubted whether people in the land of the rising sun should be investing in cryptocurrencies or potential crypto ETFs at all. DPP representative Satoshi Asano broached the crypto topic with Ishiba at the session, prompting the PM to ponder (translated by Google): “Is it appropriate for the government to encourage investment in crypto assets like [they are] stocks and investment trusts, which have investor protection regulations in place? Will the public understand the application of separate taxation? There are issues that need careful consideration.” Translated comments by the leader of Japan’s Democratic Party for the People (DPP), Yuichiro Tamaki, on X The Democratic Party for the People and others have been pushing for a separate 20% taxation rate for cryptocurrencies. Asano pointed out in his question that “As the global market for crypto assets grows rapidly, the current rule that imposes a maximum 55% tax in Japan is becoming a hindrance.” He went on to note that “Web3 companies and personal assets are flowing out of the country.” In regard to potential Japanese crypto ETFs to compete with the likes of Blackrock and others in the US and globally, Ishiba’s remarks were equally non-committal and even dismissive. “Whether or not to include crypto assets in ETFs needs to be considered based on whether crypto assets are assets that need to be made easier for the public to invest in,” Ishiba was quoted by local media. DPP leader Tamaki says party has ‘no choice but to do its best’ Posting on X in response to the comments, DPP leader Yuichiro Tamaki emphasized: “The gap between Japan and the United States, which aims to become a Bitcoin powerhouse, is getting wider and wider.” “I am disappointed with Prime Minister Ishiba’s response regarding tax reform of crypto assets. He gave no response to the application of 20% separate taxation and loss carryover deduction. He is even reluctant to consider crypto asset ETFs.” Tamaki ended his post on X by saying that his party has “no choice but to do its best.” Many fingers are crossed from Sapporo to Nagasaki, hoping for a better 2025 in Japan, and for Ishiba to come around. But at least another Japanese name in crypto, Satoshi Nakamoto, has already birthed the idea of permissionless, peer-to-peer crypto transactions that work all over the globe, regardless of political whims.

With XRP & ADA prices rising above $1 after a long time frame, the momentum appears to have shifted in favour of bulls. Meanwhile, Solana, which demonstrated monstrous moves in the recent past, is failing to gain trader’s attention as the price is slipping from its November highs. Solana surged heavily, entered the top 5 cryptos and became the 4th largest crypto with a market cap of over $120 billion in a short while. With this, the bears intensified their action, causing a notable pullback in the SOL price , which dropped by nearly 20%. After this move, the token also faced a drop in its social volume, specifically the sentiments. The number of mentions dropped drastically, suggesting the traders are no longer interested in the token. With this, will the demand for the token also drop as the technicals have also turned in favour of the bears? If yes, is the SOL price heading back to $200? The token again failed to breach through the upper resistance of the rising parallel channel that it has held since the start of the year. Previously, it has resulted in a massive pullback, which raises the possibility of a similar price action as the technicals are also mirroring the previous pattern. The MACD was bullish until the SOL price surged above $200 in Q1 2024 but soon after that, the buying pressure faded, followed by a bearish crossover of the MACD & signal line. The weekly chart of SOL price suggests the buying pressure has dropped in the past couple of weeks, which has kept the price consolidated. Moreover, the levels are heading for a bearish crossover. Additionally, the drowning RSI validated the bearish claim, which suggests the price could be heading below $200 if the bulls continue to remain passive. However, the selling volume remains lower compared to the buying, which suggests the bearish strength may be lower than that of the bulls. Therefore, the Solana price continues to remain under bearish pressure, carrying the possibility of a massive pullback.

The long-awaited $100k mark may take more time to reach as bullish momentum remains weak. In addition to the price stagnation, Bitcoin’s daily active address count and whale activity have significantly declined over the past week. Historically, a rebound in these areas is necessary to maintain a bullish trend for Bitcoin in the near term. What the Technicals Tell Us From a technical analysis standpoint, Bitcoin price has been forming a potential midterm reversal pattern. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Bitcoin price, in the one-hour time frame, has been forming a head and shoulder (H&S) pattern coupled with bearish divergence on the Relative Strength Index (RSI). If Bitcoin struggles to surpass $98.7k in the near term, Martinez believes a drop toward $90k is likely. Should the bearish trend continue, Bitcoin could fall to the support level just above $85k before any new bullish momentum kicks in. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Saylor’s Microsoft Bitcoin Proposal: Could It Boost Shareholder Value by $5 Trillion? , Mixed Activities from Whale Investors On-chain data from IntoTheBlock shows that long-term Bitcoin holders are slowly reducing their balances. Currently, long-term holders hold around 12.45 million BTC, the lowest level since July 2022. However, this decline is smaller compared to previous cycles, suggesting a more cautious approach rather than a full-scale sell-off. Institutional Demand Shrinks Exchange Supply As reported by Coinpedia, institutional demand, led by companies like MicroStrategy and BlackRock’s IBIT, is impacting the supply of Bitcoin on centralized exchanges . Over the past four weeks, Bitcoin supply on exchanges has dropped by more than 123k BTC, now sitting around 2.27 million BTC. This decline suggests that institutional interest is reducing liquidity on exchanges, further contributing to the ongoing consolidation. FAQs Why is Bitcoin struggling to surpass $98.7k? Weak bullish momentum and declining daily active addresses are preventing Bitcoin from breaking the $98.7k resistance level. How does institutional demand impact Bitcoin supply on exchanges?

Despite the excitement surrounding the idea, Polymarket bettors aren’t optimistic. They’ve given it only an 11% chance of approval, suggesting that most people don’t think shareholders will support the proposal. This low prediction highlights uncertainty about mixing Bitcoin with a company known for its stability. A Radical Plan to Boost Market Value Saylor argues that investing in Bitcoin could help Microsoft protect itself from inflation and economic uncertainty. He pointed out that Bitcoin has surged by over 1,200% in the past five years. If Microsoft had invested its spare cash in Bitcoin instead of spending it on dividends and stock buybacks, Saylor believes the company’s market value could have skyrocketed. He envisions Bitcoin helping Microsoft increase its market cap from $3.2 trillion to over $8 trillion. Microsoft – Not On Board ? Saylor views Bitcoin’s limited supply and growing reputation as “digital gold” as a major financial opportunity for Microsoft. He suggests converting the company’s cash flows, dividends, and stock buybacks into Bitcoin to unlock its potential for growth. However, the Microsoft board has not embraced the idea. They’ve advised shareholders to vote against it, citing Bitcoin’s volatility and the risks it could pose to the company’s financial stability. There are also concerns about how adding such a volatile asset could complicate Microsoft’s financial strategy and hurt its reputation. The Betting Market Thinks It’s Unlikely On Polymarket, most bettors agree that Microsoft won’t approve the Bitcoin proposal. Many believe that institutional investors already have plenty of options to invest in Bitcoin, so Microsoft doesn’t need to add it to its balance sheet. One bettor even argued that Bitcoin would just complicate things for Microsoft, mixing a volatile asset with the company’s stable investment strategy. While most bettors doubt Microsoft will fully embrace Bitcoin, a few think the company might still make a small investment. With its strong cash reserves, Microsoft could experiment with Bitcoin without committing a large portion of its strategy. This approach would allow the company to explore the potential of Bitcoin without taking on too much risk. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Massive Altcoin Rally: Top Tokens to Watch After 600% Gains , The Big Vote Is Coming Soon Microsoft’s shareholders will make the final decision on December 10.

London-based Tezos ecosystem development firm Trilitech launched Uranium.io on Tuesday to offer tokens backed by physical uranium oxide U3O8, also known as ""yellowcake.""The app was built on Etherlink, an EVM-compatible layer-2 network on top of Tezos (XTZ). The project recruited U.K.-regulated digital asset firm Archax as custodian for the underlying assets and creating the tokens. The physical metal is stored and maintained in a regulated depository at Cameco, one of the world's largest uranium producers.  Tokenized real-world assets is a rapidly growing corner of the crypto markets, with crypto firms and global financial institutions bringing traditional investments such as commodities to blockchain rails. They do so for cheaper transaction costs, faster settlements and to reach a broader investor audience. The digital tokens represent ownership of the underlying asset. For example, global bank HSBC introduced tokenized gold to retail investors in Hong Kong earlier this year.  Uranium is a crucial metal for energy production fueling nuclear power plants with rising demand. The market for uranium, however, is fragmented with trading concentrated on over-the-counter desks and retail traders' options to invest in the metal has been limited, Arthur Breitman, director of TriliTech and co-founder of the Tezos blockchain, told CoinDesk in an interview. Moving ownership representation to blockchain rails reduces frictions and makes it easier for average investors to participate, he added.  ""This is particularly exciting as nuclear power is experiencing a revival,” Breitman said.  It's not the first effort to bring trading with the yellow ore onto blockchain rails, though. Last year, a project called Uranium3o8 launched a uranium-linked token on decentralized crypto exchange Uniswap backed by forward sales agreement with a mining company. However, the project decided to pivot from its original structure and removed liquidity from the trading pair a few months after launch upon feedback from uranium traders, a spokesperson told CoinDesk, underscoring the difficulties to create a tokenization structure that works.  To ensure that the token's value is anchored to the physical metal, Uranium.io accumulated some 1.6 million ounces of uranium oxide at Cameco, Breitman said. Meanwhile, commodity trading firm Curzon Uranium also provides access to primary markets for the ore.

Moreover, it has maintained its position in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap with a valuation of $21.312 billion. With the rising bullish price action, will Avalanche price achieve a new 52-week? In this article, we have covered the possible short-term market sentiment of the Avalanche (AVAX) crypto token. AVAX Price Records 8-month High! The Avalanche price has jumped ~12% in 24 hours with a trading volume of $2.560 billion. Moreover, it has soared 24.53% over the last seven days and ~123% during November. With a YTD return of +34.11%, this altcoin is currently listed at 10th position. AVAX Price Analysis 03rd Nov 2024 The SMA indicator constantly supports the Avalanche crypto token in the 24-hour time frame. This hints at a bullish outlook for this altcoin in the upcoming time. Further, the RSI indicator continues trading above the overbought range, with its average trendline surpassing the same trend level. This suggests that the AVAX crypto token may gain significant momentum this week. Will AVAX Price Hit $100? If the bulls continue gaining momentum, the Avalanche price may retest its resistance level of $57.30. Maintaining the price above that level could set the stage for it to head toward its upper price target of $65.50 in the upcoming time. On the flip side, if the bears regain momentum, this altcoin may retest its support level of $50.

Built on the Tezos ( XTZ ) blockchain, the platform enables retail investors to trade physical uranium, a market previously reserved for institutional investors due to high entry barriers, according to a press release seen by crypto.news. The platform responds to growing global demand for uranium, driven by increased adoption of nuclear energy to meet net-zero carbon goals. This demand has surged further, with tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon investing in nuclear power to sustain the energy needs of artificial intelligence infrastructure. However, until now, trading uranium required institutional-level transactions with minimum lot sizes and significant capital, making it inaccessible for retail participants. You might also like: Pepe coin price could surge as Reddit Army plots to Pump Tokenizing Uranium Uranium.io changes this dynamic through blockchain technology. The platform eliminates traditional over-the-counter processes and high minimum purchase thresholds by tokenizing physical uranium and using smart contracts. This opens the uranium market to smaller investors, allowing them to trade fractional amounts rather than committing millions to a single transaction. Physical uranium purchased via Uranium.io is procured by Curzon Uranium, a major uranium trading company, and securely stored by Cameco, a leading uranium depository provider, according to the press release. Transactions and custody transfers are automated through smart contracts, reducing the need for intermediaries and enhancing transparency and security. The platform operates as a decentralized application on Etherlink, a Tezos-powered Layer 2 blockchain. Users can connect their digital wallets, complete Know Your Customer verification, and trade U3O8, “yellowcake,” a critical material for nuclear fuel production. The dApp’s decentralized nature also minimizes counterparty risks often associated with traditional uranium trading. This development aligns with the broader trend of real-world asset tokenization. Analysts have tracked the institutional tokenized asset market growing to over $300 million in 2023, with firms like BlackRock also exploring blockchain for asset management.

37173670,https://blockworks.co/news/coinbase-listings-crypto-usa,1733235135,What Coinbase listings say about crypto in the US,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . If you need any more reassurance that working with crypto is tipped to get easier, look no further than Coinbase listings. In fact, the rate of Coinbase listings has rapidly accelerated. Over the past two years, until the election in November, the exchange had made 88 listing announcements specific to the US — an average of 3.8 listings per month. Since Trump’s win around this time last month, Coinbase has made 16 such announcements — either for its flagship US exchange or specifically for the state of New York. Of those new coins, seven are related to memecoins: WIF, PEPE and FLOKI were all listed on Coinbase in mid-November, while the former was opened to New York residents this week. Those aren’t micro-cap memes from pump.fun. They are hugely popular established memecoins with vocal followings, which were often seen pestering Coinbase to list the tokens on X over the years. Coinbase then added MOODENG on Monday — an actual pump.fun coin — capping off a pent-up meme rollout that felt like years in the making. Assets added to the roadmap today: Moo Deng (MOODENG) https://t.co/rRB9d3hSr2 — Coinbase Assets 🛡️ (@CoinbaseAssets) December 2, 2024 Prior to Trump’s win, Coinbase had only listed one memecoin in the past two years, BONK, in December 2023. The exchange then made BONK available in New York earlier this year, in May. Coinbase and other exchanges have been historically slow to offer their full suite of coins to New York residents, on account of the Attorney General’s Office’s penchant for securities lawsuits . Other, more substantive coins have been given the Coinbase nod since the election. Helium’s MOBILE is now available in New York alongside DEGEN, ARB, SEI, AIOZ, 1INCH, EGLD, and SD. Still, Coinbase opting into memecoins to such a degree makes absolute sense for its bottom line. Memecoins bring volume which directly converts to trading fee revenue for Coinbase. The move, while potentially hindered by the continued potential of a disagreeable SEC, was probably overdue. But its actual impact on Coinbase’s own valuation may not convert so easily heading into a second Trump term. Coinbase’s share price has tracked bitcoin’s price performance almost exactly over the past year and has been slightly underperforming against it in the past two weeks. If the market is indeed pricing in potential revenues from a memecoin supercycle powered by Coinbase, it’s not yet showing up. MOODENG, though, has more than doubled, so there’s that.

37173639,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=621944,1733235002,Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin shares his idea of the perfect crypto wallet,"In a recent essay, Ethereum’s renowned creator Vitalik Buterin sketched out what he calls the perfect crypto wallet — a piece of tech that seamlessly balances security, usability, and privacy, all while embracing Ethereum’s decentralized ethos. Vitalik’s wallet dream is about taking the chaos out of crypto while still making it powerful enough to handle Ethereum’s growing web of layer 2 (L2) networks, decentralized apps (dApps), and identity systems. He focuses on advanced cross-chain capabilities, privacy-first design, and solutions to the long-standing nightmare of account security. Now let’s break it all down, piece by piece, the way he sees it. Making cross-layer transactions effortless Crypto wallets today struggle to handle Ethereum’s fragmented world of L2 chains. If you’ve ever juggled assets across Optimism, Arbitrum, and mainnet, you know the pain. Vitalik wants to end that. His ideal wallet would make sending money or interacting with smart contracts across chains as simple as sending an email. Here’s the concept: instead of a single, ambiguous Ethereum address, users could share chain-specific addresses like vitalik.eth@optimism.eth . You paste this into your wallet, hit send, and it figures everything out for you. No manual swaps. No need to check balances on half a dozen chains. If you have the right tokens on the target chain, the wallet sends them. If you don’t, it pulls funds from other chains, converts them through decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and handles the transfer. Need gas fees? The wallet will pull ETH from one chain and send it to cover fees on another. All of this should happen invisibly, without constant prompts asking users to approve technical steps they barely understand. He’s also thinking about real-world payments. Vitalik imagines QR codes becoming the standard for on-the-go crypto transactions. You scan a QR code in a café, and the wallet parses everything: the chain, token, amount, and reference ID. The end of ‘one key to rule them all’ Crypto’s brutal reality is that one mistake can wipe out your entire wallet. Lose your private key? You’re done. Vitalik’s solution is to shift from single-key systems to a combination of social recovery and multisignature (multisig) wallets. Here’s how it works: your wallet would rely on two layers of security. A primary key handles small transactions, while a network of “guardians” safeguards high-value actions like sending all your funds or updating your key. These guardians could be friends, family, or institutions that only act after verifying your identity. For newcomers, wallets might start with a basic two-of-three recovery system. This setup could include your email as one key, a passkey stored on your phone, and a backup managed by the wallet provider. Over time, as users gain experience and store more assets, they could expand to include more guardians or advanced configurations. Then there’s the futuristic stuff: zk-SNARKs. Vitalik proposes using zero-knowledge proofs to link centralized identifiers, like emails, to Ethereum wallets. Imagine an address tied to yourname@gmail.com that can only be accessed by you, verified cryptographically without exposing your identity. Privacy shouldn’t be optional Ethereum’s lack of privacy is no secret. Vitalik knows this, and he wants wallets to fix it. Today, if you want private transactions, you’re stuck with clunky tools like Tornado Cash. His vision? Make privacy automatic and seamless. A wallet built with privacy in mind would keep part of your funds in a privacy pool. When you send money, the wallet withdraws from the pool to obscure the transaction. If you’re receiving funds, the wallet generates a stealth address, making it impossible to link the sender and recipient. This isn’t just about hiding transactions. Vitalik wants wallets to create a new address for every app you interact with. Whether it’s a DeFi platform or an NFT marketplace, each interaction would be isolated. This would prevent anyone from piecing together your on-chain activity and tracking your habits. For identity, wallets could store private attestations—like proof of personhood for grants or access to token-gated communities—without exposing any personal data. Everything stays under the user’s control. Fixing wallets’ weak link: RPC providers Right now, wallets depend heavily on RPC (remote procedure call) providers to fetch blockchain data. This creates two problems: they could feed you false data or spy on your transactions. Vitalik calls for wallets to integrate light clients—simplified nodes that verify blockchain activity directly. For privacy, he suggests private information retrieval (PIR). This tech encrypts user requests so RPC providers can’t see what data they’re fetching. While computationally heavy, advancements in specialized hardware could make PIR more practical for everyday use. And most dApps today rely on centralized servers to deliver their user interfaces. This is a glaring vulnerability. If the server is hacked, users might unknowingly interact with a fake version of the app. Vitalik’s solution is on-chain content versioning. Imagine visiting a dApp through its ENS name, which points to an immutable IPFS hash of the app’s interface. Any changes to the app would require a multisig or DAO approval, adding an extra layer of trust. Wallets could flag secure, on-chain interfaces versus less-secure web-hosted ones. For those who want maximum safety, Vitalik envisions a “paranoid mode” in wallets. This mode would require explicit approval for every transaction or interaction, giving users total control over what happens. The future of wallet interfaces Vitalik says the next big leap in wallet design could come from AI and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Instead of clicking buttons, users might describe what they want to do, and an AI-powered wallet would handle the rest. Imagine saying, “Send 5 ETH to Alice and swap 2 ETH for USDC,” and the wallet instantly executes the transaction. AI could even act as a guardian, spotting suspicious activity and flagging potential risks before a transaction is signed. Then there’s the idea of BCIs—devices that read your thoughts to control technology. While still in its infancy, Vitalik sees potential in combining this with wallets, allowing users to interact with Ethereum hands-free.

The decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that governs Osmosis voted in favor of adopting Bitcoin bridge Nomic in June. The integration went live on Tuesday.   Nomic's bridge now enables users to deposit their BTC on the Bitcoin network in return for a token called alloyed BTC (allBTC) on Osmosis.   ""In leveraging Nomic's decentralized custody engine and offering zero-fee transactions, Osmosis is becoming a decentralized Bitcoin exchange,"" a spokesperson told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.   The project's aim is to give traders the user experience of popular centralized exchanges but with decentralized custody of BTC.   Osmosis is one of several projects attempting to leverage the value tied up in BTC, which is by far the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, to bring liquidity to the broader crypto world.   Bitcoin dominance - a measurement of what percent of the total crypto market BTC accounts for - hit 60% last month for the first time since March 2021, highlighting the massive wealth of bitcoin reserves compared to that which exists in any other asset.  ""I've always personally been pretty Bitcoin maxi,"" Osmosis co-founder Sunny Aggarwal said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Bitcoin ""maxi,"" an abbreviation of ""maximalist,"" is a term for people who believe BTC is the only cryptocurrency (or currency of any kind) that is needed.   ""I'm bullish on bitcoin dominance. That's the biggest market and so we want to take a big chunk of it,"" Aggarwal said.  Aggarwal describes Osmosis as a DEX for assets that don't have their own native DEXs, as opposed to tokens that are built on Ethereum or Solana, where there are plenty of native decentralized exchanges to choose from.  ""We're one of the primary DEXs for app chains and most of them were probably built using the Cosmos stack, so we have about a 95% share of DEXs in the Cosmos ecosystem,"" he told CoinDesk.  ""That's why we're looking at what other assets don't have their own DEXs, and the obvious one is bitcoin, so BTC is going to grow to be more and more a core piece of our strategy.""

37173511,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=106795,1733234634,Orbital Unveils New Stablecoin Payments Dashboard with Cutting-Edge Consumer Payment Insights,"LONDON, TALLINN, Estonia and GIBRALTAR, Dec. 3, 2024 /PRNewswire, Chainwire/ – Orbital , a multi-licensed leader in traditional and blockchain-based payment solutions, proudly announces the launch of its new Stablecoin Payments Dashboard , a first-of-its-kind tool providing unprecedented insights into stablecoin payment trends across innovative metrics. As stablecoins see growth in payment use cases—ranging from peer-to-peer transactions and online merchant payments to cross-border B2B payments and corporate treasury solutions—Orbital has identified a critical need for comprehensive data to quantify their adoption for consumer-sized payments. “Stablecoins are transforming global commerce, but businesses lack clarity on how to leverage them effectively for consumer payments,” said Luke Wingfield Digby, Co-Founder of Orbital and head of the company’s dedicated research team. “Our new dashboard fills this gap, providing actionable insights on which tokens, blockchains, and exchanges are driving consumer adoption in this fast-evolving space.” Key Insights from the Dashboard Orbital’s Stablecoin Payments Dashboard offers a novel view into stablecoin consumer payment trends: Continued Growth Across Market Cycles: Adoption of stablecoins for consumer payments has steadily increased, demonstrating resilience through crypto market fluctuations and a strong product-market fit for payments. Token Dominance: Tether’s USDT leads with over 90% of stablecoin transactions for consumer payments, underscoring its continued preference among users. Blockchain Preferences: TRON is the market leader in terms of being the blockchain of choice for consumer payments, holding 44% market share. Binance Smart Chain (37%), Polygon (4.5%), and Solana (3.3%) follow, with all other blockchains combined making up the remaining 11%. Payment Wallets: Consumers favour making stablecoin payments from exchange accounts (66% share) rather than self-hosted wallets (34% share). Binance is the clear lead, with OKX the runner up, and then a very long tail of exchanges with small market share beyond that. Regional Trends: The EMEA region emerges as a hotspot for consumer stablecoin payments, with activity peaks corresponding to populous countries such as Turkey, Nigeria, India, and Pakistan. Methodology Behind the Dashboard The Orbital Stablecoin Payments Dashboard tracks stablecoin adoption for the “payments” use case by analysing consumer-size transactions (up to $10,000). Partnering with blockchain analytics leader Artemis.xyz , the dashboard focuses on filtering out unrelated activity like DeFi and speculative trades, ensuring accurate insights into payment trends. In addition to on-chain data, Orbital plans to integrate additional data sources for a holistic view of stablecoin usage across industries and regions. This methodology empowers businesses with actionable insights into stablecoin payment behaviours. Empowering Businesses in a Stablecoin Era The dashboard equips businesses with the intelligence they need to decide which tokens and blockchains to support for accepting crypto and moving money cross-border, ensuring they remain at the forefront of consumer payment stablecoin adoption trends. It also provides insights into consumer behaviour, helping businesses adapt their payment strategies for a rapidly evolving digital payments landscape.

37173446,https://crypto.news/?p=14315788,1733234571,Singapore’s dtcpay will drop Bitcoin and Ethereum in favor of stablecoins in 2025,"Singaporean digital payment provider dtcpay announced that it will exclusively support stablecoins for its payment services by 2025, dropping Bitcoin and Ethereum in the process. In a recent X post , dtcpay announced that it will begin to strategically shift its support to only accommodate stablecoins for all of its token payments services, starting January 2025. Following this transition, the Singaporean payment firm will no longer support payments for Bitcoin( BTC ) and Ethereum( ETH ) starting next year. Despite both BTC and ETH still maintaining their spots as the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. “This means we will phase out support for Bitcoin and Ethereum by the end of this year, all other stablecoin & fiat currency services will continue to remain available,” said the firm in a post. https://twitter.com/dtc_pay/status/1863871088868077586 You might also like: Singapore Gulf Bank wants to raise at least $50m to buy stablecoin firm: report Moreover, dtcpay plans to extend support to more stablecoins to its payments services, including First Digital USD( FDUSD ) and Worldwide USD, in addition to the currently supported Tether( USDT ) and USD Coin( USDC ). The reason behind dtcpay’s transition to a stablecoin-only model is to “provide our customers with a more reliable, scalable, & secure payment experience.” Stablecoins have grown in popularity for banks and other payment firms in many parts around the world due to their value reliability, as it is pegged to fiat currencies, most often the U.S dollar. The firm’s shift to stablecoin payments reflect a wider adoption trend going on in Singapore. According to data from Chainalysis , stablecoin payments in Singapore have surged to almost $1 billion USD in the second quarter of 2024. Compared to the first quarter of 2024, this value went up 100% from nearly reaching $500 million. The report also revealed that 75% of payments that use Singaporean stablecoin XSGD were valued at $1 million or below, with nearly 25% of transfers valued below $10,000, which indicates a growing adoption rate for retail activity. In November 2023, the Monetary Authority of Singapore released a regulatory framework aimed at enhancing the stability of single-currency stablecoins. As previously reported by crypto.news, the regulations apply to non-bank issuers of single-currency stablecoins linked to the Singapore dollar or other G10 currencies, if their circulation goes over S$5 million.

Bitcoin Withdrawal Linked to US Government's Removal of 10,000 Silk Road BTC, According to QCP Reports In its latest market update, QCP noted that the news triggered a shift in market sentiment, with the front-end volatility curve tilting more toward put options rather than calls. This trend suggests an increase in bearish betting or hedging activity among traders in response to the large-scale trading. Despite the decline in cryptocurrency markets, traditional stocks continued to rally, with the S&P 500 hitting its 54th all-time high this year, underscoring the ongoing strength of broader financial markets. The Bitcoin market has historically responded to significant movements of seized assets, particularly those associated with illicit activities such as the Silk Road case. Market participants often view such transfers as potential precursors to liquidation events, adding to short-term uncertainty and volatility.

Thus, the question remains whether buyers can regain control and defend this level once more. As uncertainty looms, all eyes are on this critical zone, which could determine whether Bitcoin bounces back or faces a deeper downward trajectory. With market volatility increasing, this article aims to delve into BTC’s renewed drop toward the $93,257 support level, assessing the likelihood of a bullish defense at this critical point. It examines technical patterns, market sentiment, and key levels to better gauge Bitcoin’s next price direction. Bitcoin Slides Back Toward $93,257 On the 4-hour chart, BTC exhibits negative sentiment, attempting to drop below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) as it trends downward, with its sight set at the $93,257 support level. Furthermore, a continued descent to this support suggests that selling pressure is intensifying, and if the support fails to hold, the asset could experience more declines. Also, an analysis of the 4-hour chart shows that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 44%, following a failed attempt to break above the 50% mark. This indicates a struggle to sustain upward momentum and points to moderate bearish pressure, suggesting a cautious market sentiment. If the RSI continues to drop, it may signal heightened selling activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Is Mirroring The Same Movements From 2023, Here’s What It Means On the daily chart, the crypto giant displays significant downside movement, highlighted by bearish candlesticks after a failed recovery attempt to surge toward its previous high of $99,575. The inability to sustain the previous uptrend implies a lack of buyer confidence and a prevailing pessimistic sentiment in the market. As Bitcoin aims at the $93,257 support level, the pressure from sellers could intensify, raising concerns about the possibility of a breakdown. Finally, the 1-day RSI indicates growing bearish momentum, with the signal line retreating to 62% from the overbought zone. This means that upside pressure is fading, and a shift in market sentiment may be underway. Given that the RSI continues to decline, it could signal a pullback or consolidation, with decreasing buying interest and the potential for bears to take control. Market Sentiment: Bulls Vs. Bears At $93,257 Bitcoin is currently aiming for a retest of the critical $93,257 support level, setting the stage for a battle between bulls and bears. If the bulls manage to defend this key level, BTC could begin to rise again, aiming for its previous high of $99,575. A successful breakout above this level could pave the way for a new all-time high. Related Reading: The Current Correction In Bitcoin Is The Last Before A Major Rally—Here’s Why However, should the bears dominate at this support level, Bitcoin could continue its decline toward the $85,211 mark.

37173385,https://finbold.com/?p=216474,1733234400,Orbitt unveils a staking program with $2 million in rewards,"Orbitt (ORBT), a Solana-based ( SOL ) crypto platform, has launched a staking program with nearly $2 million in rewards, as outlined in the most up-to-date reports shared with Finbold on Tuesday, December 3. Launching on December 3, the staking initiative allows ORBT holders to generate passive income by relying on Orbitt’s buyback mechanism to not only enhance their holdings but also contribute to ecosystem growth. Orbitt staking program In addition to staking rewards, ORBT stakers will gain access to Orbitt PAD, a new launchpad for exclusive, rigorously tested projects. Orbitt promises up to $100 thousand in funding, marketing, and development assistance to support these projects. Pixel, Orbitt’s founder, described the initiative as an example of Orbitt’s dedication to sustainable growth: We’re thrilled to bring ORBT staking to our community and reward those who believe in our long-term vision. This program exemplifies Orbitt’s dedication to sustainable growth and genuine value creation. — Pixel Marketing Lead DataNinjaa shared Pixel’s sentiment: This isn’t just about staking. It’s about rewarding trust and participation in a community-centric ecosystem. — DataNinjaa Orbitt’s buyback wallet The staking initiative is fueled by Orbitt’s buyback wallet , which holds over 5 million ORBT tokens (~25% of the total supply). A new buyback mechanism funded by fees from Orbitt’s MM Volume Booster services ensures these tokens are always replenished. Participants have four staking tiers at their disposal, with staking for 30 days yielding 2x rewards, scaling to 4x if users commit to 180 days. In addition, every Volume Boosting package purchase triggers an automatic ORBT token buyback, contributing to market demand and the token’s value. New partnerships on Orbitt This launch follows Orbitt’s recent expansion of its middle-man (MM) services to platforms like Pump.fun, Meteora, and Raydium . As Orbitt continues to grow, the ORBT token is expected to play a central role in the ecosystem. Most importantly, the token will be used to unlock new products, enable access to Orbitt PAD, and reward community members.

42389233,48c56b78-ab93-4ca6-a9d3-3b89421fb8f0,1733234400,Blockchain for IoT Minima to Develop Ledger-Embedded Microchips With ARM,"Minima, a blockchain designed to manage transactions across the internet of things (IoT) comprising mobile phones, cars and other devices is working with semiconductor giant ARM to develop a microchip with a decentralized ledger embedded in it.    Under the agreement, announced Tuesday, Minima will work with ARM's Flexible Access Program, which gives 70 or so startups access to the hardware giant’s intellectual property portfolio and chip design system. The “Minima Chip” will provide each device with a secure node capable of verifying data, generating tokens, enabling peer-to-peer messaging and generally bringing “blockchain everywhere,” the companies said.    The concept of IoT and blockchain first emerged with projects like IOTA, and the idea has become part of a wider trend in crypto known as decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), which includes use cases around telecoms (Helium) and storage (Filecoin).    Much of Minima’s effort to date has been in the auto industry, working with companies such as Volvo, running full nodes within the head units of cars to underpin things like telemetry data attestation, battery passports and enhancing EV charging flexibility using tokens generated by private wallbox charging devices.    Blockchain-embedded chips offer a sleek and secure design approach, as opposed to initial testing phases in a sandbox, when it’s fine to download software, said Minima CEO Hugo Feiler. For live enterprise deployment, it’s preferable to isolate the operations of the blockchain from the complexity of an existing tech stack by having it captured on a chip, he said.    Having each device do proof of work also brings a guarantee of decentralization, although the actual mining happens in a much more collaborative manner using the Minima consensus system, Feiler said.    He used the analogy of a motorway as a “classic example of a permissionless network.”    “It’s the road that everyone has to use, and you've got Volvos, Audis and Teslas etc that don't trust each other, but they have to be able to trust the information and the data that is coming from those devices,” Feiler said in an interview. “So it's about enabling secure communication between those vehicles, and transparent value as well, such as deployment across EV charging infrastructure.”    Neil Parris, ARM's director of partner success and business models, said the access program accelerates startup innovation and time to market.    “With ARM Flexible Access, new players like Minima gain a streamlined, cost-efficient route to prototype development, giving them the freedom to experiment and design with confidence,” Parris said in a statement.",POSITIVE,IOTA,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | IOTA,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/12/03/blockchain-for-iot-minima-to-develop-ledger-embedded-microchips-with-arm,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/af1ef1910dfdac421b30a8d71b0bb885b815317a-4032x3024.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Chromia , ta Layer 1 platform that combines blockchain with relational databases, has announced the launch of the Asgard mainnet upgrade. The mainnet is the first major technical update for the blockchain, introducing new features designed to enhance the capabilities of the blockchain. The Asgard mainnet also introduces specialized Extensions – Oracle Extension and AI Inference Extension – to support the growth of decentralized finance and AI-enabled applications on the Chromia Network. These Extensions are a modular system that adds specialized capabilities to Chromia’s relational blockchain. In addition, they provide customization to decentralized applications and complement the platform’s core features, including its relational data architecture, modular network design, and gas-free economic model for end users. Asgard Mainnet Introduces Oracle Extension The first Extension launched, following Asgard’s unveiling, is the Oracle Extension . This Extension will bridge the gap between off-chain and on-chain environments, providing real-time data feeds to DApps on the platform. These data feeds are updated with each block, meaning fast, sub-second updates. This continuous data flow ensures that Chromia DApps can operate with accuracy and reliability. In addition, the Extension supports the development of complex DeFi applications such as decentralized exchanges, futures and options platforms, and lending protocols. These protocols receive critical price data, ensuring precise trade execution and secure collateral management. “The Oracle Extension lays the groundwork for an expansion of decentralized finance activity on the Chromia network and the growth of network value,” said Ludvig Öberg, VP of the Chromia Platform Unit. The Oracle Extension is part of Chromia’s plan to interconnect with the broader crypto and blockchain ecosystems. It adds to the recent developments in integrating CHR and the Chromia Network with select centralized exchanges (CEXs) and cross-chain wallets. This aims to make Chromia more accessible and interconnected, driving increased user activity and total value locked (TVL) on the network. AI Inference Extension Set To Launch Q1 2025 The team statement also confirmed the launch of the second piece of the Chromia Extensions puzzle – AI Inference Extension. Expected to launch in Q1 2025, the AI Inference Extension is a module that will enable developers to execute AI models directly on-chain using Chromia’s decentralized provider network. The project’s recently formed Data and AI Division is focused on creating tools to enhance transparency in AI training data and inputs. Yeou Jie, Head of Business Development at Chromia, explained the benefits and futuristic innovations set to be brought about by the Extension’s launch, stating: “As the world’s only relational blockchain, Chromia has demonstrated its ability to bring transparency to AI and other data-intensive use cases. The AI Inference Extension will take this a step further, enabling on-chain execution of AI models.” A public demonstration of the Oracle Extension has been released following the Asgard upgrade. Notwithstanding, the Extension will also be integrated into several DApps, with the team expecting the Oracle to support other DApps apart from DeFi, including AI, gaming, and enterprise use cases. Finally, the team also announced its plans to continue bridging blockchain technology solutions with real-world problems and expand its potential in areas such as data availability, and zero-knowledge solutions slated for future releases.

Expert investors believe that the DTX Exchange could surpass the XRP price by 2025. There are some positive developments in Ripple's regulatory case, but DTX Exchange has the edge with its robust infrastructure and industry-disrupting capabilities. This guide will check how the Ripple-SEC ruling can impact XRP price and why DTX Exchange can surpass major altcoins in 2025. Ripple-SEC Lawsuit Update: Final Verdict Timeline Shortened Ripple has been handed a significant win with the granting of a motion for upset and the US court's decision to speed up the final judgment in the Ripple SEC case is a generous stride towards victory. This development is essential in the long battle that has plagued XRP, the native token of Ripple. Ripple acquired this latest success following the SEC's failure to prove its case in favor of it, which is presently affecting the regulatory events in the U.S. Jeremy Hogan, the attorney supporting Ripple predicted that the SEC case could be concluded around the middle of 2025, especially if there is a change in the leadership at the SEC. As expected these news have made a big impact on the XRP price rise and a new SEC chair is being expected to take over the battle hence igniting hopes that this legal battle may soon be over. How Will It Impact XRP Price? The effect of this win on the XRP price can now be seen, as it has increased by nearly 15% in the last three sessions. The $1.65 is the local resistance level, which can be a barrier to the XRP price. Due to the Trump win and SEC case developments, the XRP price has already broken the multi-year resistance, which can soon create a new all-time high. However, the XRP price has already extended; hence, traders are advised to be cautious while trading. DTX Exchange Undervalued Price See Huge Demand According to the extrapolation, the DTX Exchange could rise to $5 in the first half of 2025, making the current price of $0.1 highly undervalued. This projection is based on the upcoming launch of the DTX Exchange on Tier-1 exchanges like Binance. Also, the outstanding fundamentals of DTX Exchange play an important role in its growth story. DTX Exchange uses advanced technology like VulcanX and AI to create the best trading platform. It aims to bridge the gap between conventional and digital finance with a strong positioning in DeFi. Features like multi-asset trading and 1,000x leverage, along with community benefits like incentives and active rewards, make DTX Exchange stand out in the crowd. Also, the advanced trading tools like quantitative and algorithmic trading make it an updated and advanced trading solution for modern-age traders. The testnet launch has proved its efficiency, recording 10,000 transactions per second, one of the highest in the industry. Also, Solid Proof, a well-known audit firm, has reviewed DTX Exchange tokens. The audit confirms the platform’s security, giving you confidence to investors.

37173845,https://invezz.com/?p=2336209,1733234114,"Crypto payment platform Dtcpay to drop BTC and ETH, shift to stablecoins","Dtcpay, a Singapore-licensed cryptocurrency payment platform, has announced that it will phase out support for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) by the end of 2024 and focus solely on fiat and stablecoin transactions starting in January 2025. This move reflects Dtcpay’s commitment to offering a more secure, predictable, and regulatory-compliant payment solution. Dtcpay to shift to fiat and stablecoin-only payment services According to the Dtcpay announcement , Dtcpay will transition to exclusively support fiat and stablecoins such as Tether’s USDT, USD Coin (USDC), and two newer additions to its platform: First Digital USD (FDUSD) and Worldwide USD (WUSD). The company’s move aligns with broader industry trends where digital payments are increasingly driven by the demand for stable assets in an era of economic uncertainty. By focusing on stablecoins, Dtcpay aims to cater to the growing need for scalability and security in the digital payments landscape. In addition to its stablecoins, Dtcpay will continue to support fiat currency services, ensuring businesses and consumers can still enjoy seamless, cross-border transactions. Why is Dtcpay dropping Bitcoin and Ethereum? The decision to drop Bitcoin and Ethereum from Dtcpay’s payment services stems from the inherent volatility of these cryptocurrencies. Dtcpay emphasized that the unpredictable price fluctuations of Bitcoin and Ethereum have made them less suitable for stable, everyday transactions. In contrast, stablecoins, which are pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar, offer a more reliable alternative that mitigates these risks. The transition is also in response to observed user behaviour, as a significant portion of Dtcpay’s transaction volume already comes from stablecoin payments. According to the company, this shift will provide a more stable and predictable experience for businesses and consumers who seek a trustworthy digital payment system. The shift to stablecoins also reflects the increasing popularity of these digital assets in the global financial system. A recent report from Chainalysis revealed that stablecoin payments in Singapore reached nearly US$1 billion in the second quarter of 2024, highlighting the surging demand for stable, regulated digital payment solutions. This trend is mirrored by Dtcpay’s own growing stablecoin transaction volumes, reinforcing the platform’s decision to adapt to market needs. Dtcpay’s move is also indicative of the company’s broader vision for the future of digital payments. The firm has a strong track record of innovation and was the only Asia-based company selected for the Mastercard Start Path program. Dtcpay is also the first regulated point-of-sale (POS) provider in Singapore to accept cryptocurrencies, further solidifying its leadership in the fintech sector. As the company continues to expand, it remains committed to providing secure, scalable, and reliable payment solutions for businesses and consumers worldwide.

37173305,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4741744-cleanspark-stock-too-cheap-after-q4-earnings-results?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1733234111,CleanSpark Stock: Still Way Too Cheap After Q4 Earnings Results,"Summary CleanSpark stock is up 68% since October, showing strong potential despite a 6% pre-market drop after Q4 results, maintaining a bullish outlook. CLSK stock valuation remains attractive, with significant capacity growth and a substantial Bitcoin treasury, suggesting further upside potential if Bitcoin prices rise. CleanSpark's high short interest (19%) could lead to volatility but also offers potential for swift stock movement upon an upside breakout. Despite risks like rising Bitcoin difficulty and volatility, CleanSpark's strategy and bullish Bitcoin outlook support a Strong Buy rating. CleanSpark overview Bitcoin miner CleanSpark ( CLSK ) posted fourth quarter earnings on Monday night, and the stock is off about 6% pre-market following the report. The last time I covered CleanSpark was in early October, and the stock is up 68% since then. Seeking Alpha At the time, I called out a bottoming pattern in the chart that looked like it had strong potential, as well as a compelling valuation. The bottoming pattern certainly worked out as the stock has added two-thirds to its value since, but the valuation hasn’t really budged. As we dig into the fourth quarter results, the fact that the valuation hasn’t moved has me remaining quite bullish. Let’s dig in. CLSK stock - Resistance overhead, but only a matter of time That’s how I’m viewing the price chart today, following that huge advance. We have what should be a strong resistance level right around $15, which was the bottom of the trading range from February to July. When that broke, it was a nasty development. However, if the stock can sustainably reenter that range, I think it could be off to the races. StockCharts We can see the stock closed on Monday right under that level after a failed move in November. For now, we have the PPO in positive territory, and a neutral Chaikin Money Flow index. The stock is trading right at the 20-day EMA pre-market, and just over the relative high from October. This is a decision point for investors as we are either going to see it bounce from these levels, or suffer a larger breakdown. My absolute line in the sand in terms of short-term support is the rising 50-day SMA, currently just under $12. Obviously, the direction of Bitcoin itself is critical, and I detailed my views on the OG alt-coin recently. StockCharts Bitcoin is obviously consolidating after its parabolic move following the US election. We have a lower high in place now, so unless and until we get a move over $100k, Bitcoin is drifting sideways to down. This is normal after parabolic moves, so I’m not concerned; investors have to take moves like this into account, and you’ll get sellers into profit. The first level to watch is the 20-day EMA at ~$93k, and then the 50-day SMA at ~$81k. I don’t think we’re going to see the 50-day SMA anytime soon, but I would not be surprised to see the 20-day EMA taken out temporarily during this consolidation phase. While the short-term looks choppy, I absolutely remain bullish on Bitcoin, and believe it is only a matter of time before we get a bunch of new highs. Should that be the case, it stands to reason CleanSpark and the other miners should follow suit. On the valuation front, I’ve recreated the chart I showed back in October noting that CleanSpark’s valuation relative to Bitcoin had plummeted. StockCharts The blue rectangle is the time that has elapsed since my October article, and we can see the valuation really hasn’t moved. By extension, that means I’m still just as bullish on the valuation as I was then, fueling my still-bullish view on CleanSpark. Finally, CleanSpark’s short interest is a staggering 19% of the float, meaning that if we do get an upside breakout, we could see the stock move quite swiftly. Short interest is not the reason to buy or sell CleanSpark on its own. Short interest makes a stock extremely volatile, and stocks with high short interest often have it for a reason. But it’s a potential help for the bull case if and when we do get the breakout. A record year CleanSpark’s full-year results showed revenue more than doubling year-over-year to $379 million, although it did miss expectations by about $7 million. GAAP earnings came to a loss of 69 cents per share, again missing estimates. However, I’m not particularly concerned about current results with CleanSpark; it’s in a high-growth phase where it’s rapidly investing in and deploying capacity, as well as building its Bitcoin treasury for future value. The company’s strategy has been to continue to prioritize owned infrastructure in building its hashrate, which is now on course for 37 EH/s by the end of the year, and 50 EH/s into 2025. In the past year, the company has added 423 MWs to its portfolio, which more than doubled its capacity over that period to 726 MW. CleanSpark noted it has hundreds of MW in the near-term pipeline ready to deliver, which will continue to boost its capacity to mine. CleanSpark’s capacity helped it produce about 7,100 Bitcoin. Adjusted EBITDA for the year was $246 million, up enormously from $25 million in the prior year. While GAAP earnings were negative, the company’s EBITDA number shows sustained progress on building capacity profitably. As we’ve seen corporations hold Bitcoin as a store of value, the balance sheets of miners have taken on new significance. CleanSpark ended the year with $122 million in cash and equivalents. In addition, it held just over 8,000 Bitcoin, and produced 655 more in October, subsequent to the end of the quarter. Just the balance at the end of September is worth about $760 million at today’s Bitcoin price, so it’s a massive portion of the company’s market cap. Keep in mind that as CleanSpark continues to build its Bitcoin balance – which it can do given it has plenty of cash to operate and build its mining capacity – its correlation to Bitcoin’s price should rise. That helps drive the bull case given the relatively low valuation of CleanSpark to Bitcoin. While CleanSpark showed a net loss for the fiscal year, the company continues to build capacity, as well as its Bitcoin hoard. Q4, then, shows in my view, continued progress for the bulls, and a share price that doesn’t yet fully reflect the company’s potential. Risks to consider Obviously, CleanSpark is not exactly a safe and stable stock, as it carries with it significant risk. However, with significant risk comes significant potential reward, and I suspect that if you’re looking for a blue chip to park retirement money, you wouldn’t be here. Any potential position you might take should be carefully considered, and prudently sized. One of the things that is out of CleanSpark’s control that can impact the bull case is its ability to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet. Bitcoin difficulty continues to rise – as it will forever – meaning it takes more capacity to mine the same amount of Bitcoin, all else equal. CoinWarz Difficulty is at its highest-ever level once again, and this will simply continue to rise over time. The rate at which it rises is of particular interest to miners, CleanSpark included. The risk here is that if difficulty moves a lot higher, it means the number of Bitcoin that can be added to the balance sheet declines. Another risk is that the price of Bitcoin itself falls significantly. I’ve made it clear I don’t think that’s likely to happen, but it definitely could. If it does, CleanSpark shares are likely to suffer meaningfully. Lastly, volatility and short interest are factors here. I touched on this earlier, but wanted to drive the point home. For some context on CleanSpark’s volatility, the implied volatility of at-the-money options for one month from now is about 150%. That’s 15X the S&P 500, so that’s what you’re dealing with here. That level of volatility in and of itself is a risk to shareholders. I mentioned short interest earlier, and we have nearly one-fifth of the float shorted today. However, with all factors taken into account, I believe CleanSpark is likely to continue its bull run, particularly given my bullish stance on Bitcoin itself. CleanSpark should benefit from higher Bitcoin prices, and potentially from its extremely low valuation relative to Bitcoin normalizing. I’m reiterating my Strong Buy on CleanSpark after FQ4 results.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4741744-cleanspark-stock-too-cheap-after-q4-earnings-results?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37173305.jpeg

While XRP has passed the $2 price for the first time since 2018, INTL has given early buyers a 610% return. Since this altcoin will also tap into the growing AI market, which Statista predicts may be worth $826B by 2030, experts are very bullish. They foresee INTL potentially soaring by 900% in 2025. Kyle Chassé: Traders Should Watch Solana (SOL) Carefully for Price Growth Solana (SOL) is showing some green price charts as one of the best cryptos. CoinMarketCap shows that the price of Solana jumped over 35% in the past month alone. During that time, its value moved between $165 and $223. Crypto analyst Kyle Chassé also remains optimistic for Solana (SOL). According to his X post, this altcoin has seen its highest monthly close. This is very bullish behavior that could lead to more price growth. This Solana price prediction is also backed by its technical analysis. TradingView shows that the Solana coin now trades above its 50-day EMA ($206) and 100-day EMA ($185). This could mean further upside potential. Pharaoh Makes a Bullish Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction Ripple (XRP) is another altcoin experiencing price growth right now. On the one-week chart, the Ripple price increased from $1.45 to $2.43, a 70% surge in just a few days, according to CoinMarketCap. The technicals for Ripple (XRP) are also showing some good signs. TradingView shows that this altcoin trades above its 10-day EMA of $1.79 and its 20-day EMA of $1.47. Additionally, its MACD level sits at 0.36, which is in the buy zone and suggests a good entry point for buyers. Market expert Pharaoh also made a bullish Ripple price prediction. In his X post, he said that this altcoin could see a surge to a new ATH soon. In other words, the Ripple crypto may jump past $3.40 soon. IntelMarkets (INTL) Soars 610%, Further Gains Incoming IntelMarkets (INTL) is also capturing attention as one of the hottest new ICOs. It has already seen a price surge of 610%. Since this presale is now in phase seven, this percentage will continue rising before it ends. People are excited about the long-term growth potential of IntelMarkets as it will introduce the first AI-powered smart trading platform. On it, people will find many features that do not exist anywhere else, like self-learning trading robots, autopilot bots, and more. By holding the INTL token, traders will also receive: Governance Voting Rights: The ability to vote on important issues for the platform. Reduced Trading Fees: Up to 30% discounts on trading fees. First Access: INTL holders will get new IntelMarkets products and features first. Currently, one INTL costs only $0.064, a 610% surge from its starting presale price of $0.009. However, phase eight will bring another jump to $0.073. Additionally, a top-tier crypto exchange may trigger a rally to $0.11. In other words, those who buy this altcoin now may get a 71% return. Can IntelMarkets (INTL) Soar Like Solana (SOL) & Ripple (XRP)? Although Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) are among the top 10 altcoins right now, experts are also bullish on IntelMarkets (INTL). They think that INTL could see faster price growth as it has a smaller market cap. Therefore, many experts forecast a potential 900% surge for INTL sometime in 2025.

Despite declining profitability in its software business, MicroStrategy transformed into a ""digital goldmine"" by leveraging low-interest convertible bonds to amass Bitcoin. The company holds 402,100 BTC, valued at $38.20 billion, and aims to raise $42 billion to accumulate more Bitcoin through its aggressive ""21/21 plan"". MicroStrategy's Bitcoin Yield, measuring acquisition efficiency, stands at 56.4%, with a target of 6-10% annually, reflecting its strategic focus on Bitcoin accumulation. Investment Thesis MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) has become the undisputed darling of Wall Street in 2024, having risen by over 500%. Love it or hate it, the numbers don't lie: it has outperformed every asset in existence this year, even the one responsible for its own rise, Bitcoin. mstr-tracker.com Let's get straight to the point. The reason why this stock is rising so much, it's because it's not even a traditional company anymore. It's a high-stakes bet on Bitcoin's price and potential for adoption. Citron Research has recently taken a short position on the stock, calling it ""overheated"". Other skeptics are calling it a ponzi scheme. We, on the other hand, are looking at the full picture here. This stock has the potential to reach half a trillion dollar market cap, and it all depends on one man's plan - Michael Saylor. MicroStrategy as a Software Company The truth is that MicroStrategy is not the best software company you can buy. The company's business intelligence segment has seen its profitability decline steadily over the past decade. Between 2010 and 2019, MicroStrategy averaged $3.94 in annual earnings per share ((EPS)), but by 2024, that figure dropped significantly due to massive share dilution and operational losses. With shares increasing from 10.1 million in 2019 to 216.24 million in 2024 , EPS now sits at just $2.18 TTM. Operational losses have also deepened, with TTM losses of $406.7 million reported in 2024. CCN The ""Infinite Money Glitch"" and the ""21/21 Plan"" Disregarding the software segment of the business, MicroStrategy has transformed itself from a losing business into a ""digital goldmine"", metaphorically and literally. The company is essentially raising funds through low-interest convertible bonds and investing it all into Bitcoin. This means that they are converting an inflating asset into a scarce one, for free. These bonds are issued at a 0% interest rate and investors are willing to lend the company money with the prospect of converting those loans into shares in the future. Additionally, MicroStrategy has used Bitcoin's volatility to its advantage, by turning impairment losses into deferred tax benefits. For example, in 2022, Bitcoin-related impairments accounted for nearly 77% of operating expenses, but these also positioned the company to benefit when Bitcoin prices rebounded this year. With 402,100 BTC at the time of writing this report, valued at $38.20 billion, MicroStrategy now holds close to 2% of Bitcoin's lifetime supply. Following its Q3 2024 earnings release, the company has announced a more aggressive accumulation plan for Bitcoin. This ""21/21 plan"" aims to raise $42 billion, split evenly between equity and debt, to accumulate even more coins. The Bitcoin Yield, which measures the efficiency of Bitcoin acquisitions relative to shareholder capital deployment is how the company evaluates its strategy. As of Q4 2024, MicroStrategy's Bitcoin Yield stands at 56.4%. The proposed annual target is 6-10%. HedgeMix This high yield is probably unsustainable in the long run but really shows the company's ability to acquire Bitcoin at favorable prices and with efficient financing. The higher the yield, the more effectively MicroStrategy enhances shareholder exposure to Bitcoin without excessive dilution or over-leveraging. Historically, each 1% change in Bitcoin Yield has corresponded to approximately 4,557 BTC acquired. Using this correlation, we can estimate the company's annual Bitcoin acquisitions under three scenarios: HedgeMix If Bitcoin's price stabilizes around $100,000 in the coming years, the 21/21 Plan could increase MicroStrategy's holdings to between 600,000 and 700,000 BTC by 2027. In the longer term, our projections estimate the company's holdings to exceed 1,000,000 BTC by 2032 under the bullish scenarios. Valuation Valuing MicroStrategy is not an easy challenge since traditional methods such as DCF models fail to capture the company's dual role as a software company and Bitcoin treasury. Instead, we choose to value the company based on its Bitcoin holdings and the premium investors are willing to pay for it. As of the 2nd of December 2024, MicroStrategy's 402,100 BTC holdings are valued at approximately $38.20 billion, taking an average price of $95,000 per coin. After accounting for $4.57 billion in liabilities, its net Bitcoin assets stand at $33.63 billion. MicroStrategy currently trades at an NAV premium of approximately 2.54. Under various Bitcoin price scenarios, this premium has a dramatic impact on the implied share price: $95,000 BTC: Implied share price of $395 which is the current price. $250,000 BTC: Implied share price could soar above $1,000 at the same NAV multiple. $250,000 BTC with a tech premium such as 8x: Share price could exceed $3,400. HedgeMix The valuation further depends on MicroStrategy's ability to execute its 21/21 Plan and maintain its efficiency in acquiring Bitcoin. However, what is remarkable about the company's model, is that unlike traditional revenue sources that cannot be adjusted, Bitcoin's value could keep increasing as long as MicroStrategy keeps acquiring and holding it. If Bitcoin's price rises over time, ""Bitcoin revenue"" grows in parallel. Assuming a Bitcoin price from $75,000 up to $1,000,000 and various multiples on NAV, we can extrapolate some price estimates for MicroStrategy, from the most conservative to the most bullish scenario. (This valuation also assumes that BTC holdings remain constant). HedgeMix Now, you also might be worried if this is a very bullish target price for Bitcoin. We are simply using some publicly available valuation methods like the Bitcoin rainbow chart , which is predicting an average Bitcoin price between $200,000 and $1,820,000 by 2032. Bitcoin Rainbow Chart And it looks like we are being conservative here. The Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow Model by PlanB is forecasting a price of $5 million by 2032, based on the assumption that the ongoing supply reduction will continue driving the price upwards. And we're not the only ones sharing this bullish sentiment. Here are some predictions for Bitcoin's price by analysts within the next 8 years: HedgeMix Now, if you are worried about the 2.54x NAV premium, you really have no reason to. The company is essentially offering Bitcoin exposure as a regulated equity vehicle, something that institutional investors love. It is also a tax-advantaged way for retail investors to hold Bitcoin through retirement accounts. Lastly, the company is still generating cash flows through its software segment, justifying an extra premium. As for the worries about liquidation, although valid, we really see no reason to stress at the current Bitcoin price levels. MicroStrategy's average Bitcoin price is around $58,000 . As volatile as the digital currency is, there is a long way to go before it drops to those levels that could force the company to start liquidating its holdings. Lastly, the company is currently borrowing at essentially 0% interest rates, and in any worst-case scenario, it is still generating some decent cash flows that could help weather any potential storm. Catalysts Donald Trump's recent presidential victory is widely seen as favourable for Bitcoin, as he intends to create a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve. Growing legislative support, thanks to Senator Cynthia Lummis's BITCOIN Act, is also bullish for Bitcoin. Any positive catalysts for the cryptocurrency translate to bullish momentum for MicroStrategy. A potential inclusion to the Nasdaq 100 Index in the next rebalancing before the end of the year could attract inflows from ETFs like QQQ, QQQM, and QQQE, estimated at close to $1 billion. Upcoming changes in accounting standards after December 15 will allow MicroStrategy to report its Bitcoin holdings at market value, which could be seen as a positive event for shareholders. Ben Werkman on X Summary We are very bullish on the long-term potential for MicroStrategy and Bitcoin in general. The company's revolutionary strategy of converting fiat capital into a deflationary and appreciating asset is appreciated by Wall Street as well. If Bitcoin's price continues to surge beyond $100,000, MicroStrategy could see its NAV multiply even further. This will translate to more demand for shares, which will keep outpacing dilution and keep pushing the share price higher. Our target share price is close to $1,000. Although some risks are evident, the market's enthusiasm reeks of confidence in this stock, and so do we. We believe there is more substance to the hype and there is still plenty of space for the company to grow.

This is just a preview of the insights available in CoinDesk's latest report, Driven by Demand: The People-Powered Crypto Movement in APAC. Download the report today for even more exclusive findings.    The region already boasts a higher adoption rate than its neighbors at 22% versus a worldwide average of 7.8%. The report found this is driven by a range of factors including rising internet penetration, evolving regulatory environments, speculative interest, practical utility, growing understanding, and a belief in crypto's future potential.    Surveying 4,267 people across Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, and the UAE, it found that 50% of adults in the region are somewhat or very positive toward crypto – despite a regional adoption rate of less than half that.    “This highlights enormous potential for future growth,” the report’s authors wrote.    A further 27% held neutral views on crypto and 24% said they remained skeptical of its value. But positive sentiment is growing, with 50% feeling more positive about crypto than they did a year ago. “This upswing in sentiment might be influenced by several factors, including Bitcoin’s recent strong performance and an absence of any notable, recent scandals,” the report noted.    “However, sentiment can be fickle, so there's an urgency for market players to responsibly capitalize on these favorable conditions.”    Financial Transformation    More than six out of ten adults in the region believe that digital assets will play a significant role in the future of global finance and investment, according to the survey.    As the region undergoes a financial transformation coupled with fast development in emerging markets, the report noted a grassroots-level interest and embrace of crypto. Over half of adults think crypto will be used for everyday purposes, despite crypto not being legal tender in most countries in the region. “This optimism suggests a sense of inevitability about crypto's role in daily life,” the report said.    It also states that further adoption will be driven by practical benefits. A total of 29% of respondents said that 29% value crypto for the ability to make payments within their country, 27% for cross-border transactions and 30% for access to financial services-though the report does not state what proportion of respondents have used crypto for these purposes.    Nevertheless, it states that these motivations “underscore a pragmatic approach to crypto adoption, one based on tangible benefits and real-world applications.”    Emerging Markets    The report also reported higher interest and adoption in emerging markets compared to more established financial jurisdictions such as Japan and Australia. Despite the two’s relatively favorable crypto regulation and infrastructure, actual adoption remains lower compared to other areas due to a comparatively weaker demand.    “Conversely, places like the Philippines and the UAE not only have effective enablers in place to support crypto adoption, but also strong underlying demand,” the report said. “[This results] in some of the highest crypto adoption rates in not just APAC, but the world.”  UPDATE 12/4: This post was corrected. The survey showed a 22% crypto adoption rate in APAC.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION,Callan Quinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/coindesk-news/2024/12/03/apac-will-lead-the-next-phase-of-global-crypto-growth-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1a001fdf5aa3c3bb63f8f3e8168c0374e6e7b03-1280x854.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
37174992,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/cardano-ada-price-predicted-to-reach-12-heres-when,1733233664,Cardano (ADA) Price Predicted to Reach $12: Here’s When,"The cryptocurrency Cardano (ADA), which has crossed the $1 barrier once again within the crypto market after regaining its strength, has recently made headlines. Currently priced at $0.989 with a market cap of $34.69 billion, ADA is well-poised for a decent upside. Analysts believe that an influx of whale accumulation, market maturity, and positive sentiment in the larger crypto market could allow ADA to target the $12 mark within the next year, with some estimates reaching as soon as 6 months. A Bullish Cardano at $12 A consolidation at around the $1 level, at which Cardano has rested for a while, has set the perfect stage for its next bull run. Analysts have observed that this redistribution phase may see ADA over the $5 to $10 mark and likely $12 if the bullish sentiment grows stronger. Such bullish expectations are consistent with the BTC and ETH recovery. In addition, Cardano’s whales have not been idle and have continued to amass ADA, with more than 130 million tokens added to their previous holdings over the last month. As of November 27, these whales owned a total of 3.2 billion ADA, seemingly indicating confidence in the potential of the token. This increased accumulation seems to go hand in hand with ADA’s gradual uptrend in price, to the extent that there have been very few attempts to take profit, giving a lot of bullish aspects to the outlook. Even though the $12 mark is a bit far-fetched, strong backing from the community, relentless development of the ecosystem, and market expectations make it a practical objective for accomplishment over the next twelve months. Rexas Finance (RXS): In 2025, It Should Reach $12 The ascent of Cardano towards $12 is quite admirable, but Rexas Finance (RXS) has the potential to achieve this goal in a much shorter time. At the moment, while Cardano is set, RXS, during the presale stage, has been gaining a lot of publicity for its novel ideas of tokenizing physical objects, which were unheard of before. It is currently priced at $0.10. Factors Behind RXS Growth Rexas Finance is set to change how the world views blockchain as it now offers a suite of utilities and solutions. Its key strengths include: Ease of Use: The Rexas Token Builder allows non-technical users to build their own tokens with ease. Rexas Estate: Enhances real estate transactions and alleviates investment resource issues by digitizing these processes. Rexas Treasury: A multi-chain yield optimizer that enables users to deposit and earn compounding interest. Rexas GenAI: A tool for NFT customers providing insights and recommendations to assist them during their work. With these features, Rexas Finance targets both retail and institutional investors, increasing its adoption and market value. Structured Tokenomics The RXS tokenomics are well-planned to support uninterrupted growth in the long term. The total supply of RXS tokens stands at 1 billion. Out of the total supply: 42.5% is allocated for the presale. 22.5% for staking pools. 15% for liquidity. 10% for the treasury. The remaining portions are reserved for marketing, team incentives, giveaways, and partnerships. Such an allocation provides a proper balance between funding development, rewarding early investors, and growing the community. Credibility Through Listings and Audits Rexas Finance has already secured rankings on industry-trusted platforms such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. Such listings increase the visibility and confidence in RXS, opening it to a wider pool of investors globally. To further build confidence, Rexas Finance submitted itself for a Certik audit and evaluation to ensure transparency and security. This audit guarantees that RXS is a dependable and safe investment, unlike many nascent projects within the DeFi sector. Rexas Finance Over Cardano While the $12 price target for Cardano is achievable due to its solid fundamentals, Rexas Finance appears to be a better investment case. Starting at $0.10 with a sound plan, RXS is likely to achieve more than 100x growth by 2025. Its state-of-the-art features, sound tokenomics, and presale success mark it as a project capable of competing with Cardano’s price performance but in a shorter period. For investors seeking high-growth opportunities, Rexas Finance offers a competitive advantage over Cardano with its innovation, credibility, and market momentum. With the promising prospects of the crypto market, it is only a matter of time before RXS leads the next DeFi revolution, rewarding its early backers generously.

37173734,https://thecoinrise.com/sonic-blockchain-edges-closer-to-public-launch-with-genesis-milestone-and-token-airdrop/,1733233555,Sonic Blockchain Edges Closer to Public Launch with Genesis Milestone and Token Airdrop,"Sonic Labs has announced the achievement of “Genesis,” marking the creation of the inaugural block on its highly anticipated Sonic blockchain. Described as a speed-oriented Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible layer-1 network, it aims to provide enhanced performance for developers and users by minimizing latency and transaction costs. Sonic is considered the successor to Fantom Opera, with major b acking from the Fantom Foundation , which has been instrumental in building Fantom’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem since 2019. The rebranding to Sonic reflects a commitment to advancing blockchain infrastructure and addressing critical performance bottlenecks. On December 2, Sonic Labs revealed on X that infrastructure deployment is underway, signaling a “public launch soon.” This announcement follows the unveiling of its upgraded testnet, Blaze 2.0, on December 1, which has been designed to refine the network before the mainnet goes live. S Token Airdrop and Developer-Centric Features In parallel with its Genesis milestone, Sonic Labs has completed a “Snapshot” for an airdrop of 200 million S tokens. These tokens, exchangeable on a 1:1 basis with Fantom token, were distributed to users who engaged with Sonic’s arcade games, such as Coinflip and Plinko. With the games now closed, the focus shifts to the network’s proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism , enabling S token holders to stake their assets. Sonic is strategically designed to appeal to developers, with 90% of transaction fees generated by the network being redistributed back to them. This feature, highlighted by Sonic’s CTO Andre Cronje—former chair and technical advisor for Fantom—positions the blockchain as an attractive platform for innovation. Speed and Migration Bolster Sonic’s Edge Sonic’s standout feature is its impressive transaction finality time of just 720 milliseconds, achieved during its testnet phase. This efficiency places it in direct competition with high-speed chains like Solana and Base. The Fantom Foundation has further incentivized the transition to Sonic by allocating $120 million in Fantom tokens to facilitate developer migration from Fantom to Sonic. Additionally, the establishment of the Sonic Foundation in May underscores efforts to ensure robust governance, treasury management, and the development of a thriving DeFi ecosystem.

A New Blockchain Contender With Big Gains and Game-Changing Tech","Bitcoin and Ethereum have long been the pillars of blockchain technology. Bitcoin introduced the world to decentralized currency, while Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities revolutionized how blockchain could be used. But as technology advances and industry demands evolve, a new contender is emerging to join these giants: Lightchain Protocol AI. With its mainnet launch planned for mid-2025, Lightchain AI is poised to redefine blockchain with its groundbreaking integration of artificial intelligence (AI), scalable solutions, and sustainability focus. Investors in the Lightchain presale can secure Lightchain Tokens (LCAI) and position themselves for potential big gains as this innovative platform reshapes the market. What Makes Lightchain AI a Game-Changer? While Bitcoin is renowned for its security and Ethereum for its versatility, Lightchain Protocol AI introduces features that combine the strengths of both while addressing their limitations. It’s designed to handle the demands of modern blockchain applications with a focus on real-world utility. Proof of Intelligence (PoI): A Smarter ConsensusLightchain AI introduces Proof of Intelligence (PoI), a unique consensus mechanism that rewards nodes for completing AI computations like data processing and machine learning tasks. This eliminates the need for energy-intensive mining, aligning with global sustainability goals while providing practical benefits to AI development. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM):The AIVM sets Lightchain AI apart by enabling decentralized applications (dApps) to integrate AI capabilities directly into their operations. From predictive analytics to automation, the AIVM transforms how developers can leverage blockchain technology. Advanced Scalability Solutions:With sharding and Layer 2 integrations, Lightchain AI can handle thousands of transactions per second. This ensures that the platform remains fast, reliable, and cost-effective even as usage scales. The Competitive Edge: Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum While Bitcoin has carved out its niche as a store of value and Ethereum dominates dApp development, Lightchain AI’s blend of scalability, sustainability, and AI integration positions it to capture new markets and address emerging needs. Sustainability: Bitcoin’s energy-intensive Proof of Work model and Ethereum’s still-evolving Proof of Stake system face criticism for their environmental impact. Lightchain AI’s PoI mechanism offers a green alternative that aligns with modern sustainability standards. Utility Beyond Finance: Unlike Bitcoin, which is primarily used for transactions and investment, and Ethereum, which powers dApps, Lightchain AI has applications in diverse sectors, including healthcare, logistics, and artificial intelligence. Industries Poised for Disruption by Lightchain AI Decentralized Finance (DeFi):Lightchain AI’s ability to integrate AI into DeFi platforms enables smarter lending, real-time risk analysis, and automated trading, creating a new standard for financial innovation. Healthcare:The platform’s privacy-preserving architecture and AI-driven diagnostics allow for secure sharing of medical data and improved healthcare outcomes. Supply Chain Management:Real-time analytics and AI-powered optimization ensure transparency, efficiency, and cost savings across global logistics networks. Why Analysts Are Bullish on Lightchain AI Market Timing:With its mainnet launch scheduled for mid-2025, Lightchain AI is entering the market at a time when blockchain adoption is accelerating and industries are seeking scalable, intelligent solutions. Early Investment Opportunity:The presale of Lightchain Tokens (LCAI) provides investors with a ground-floor opportunity to capitalize on a platform that combines cutting-edge technology with real-world utility. Massive Growth Potential:As the first blockchain to seamlessly integrate AI capabilities into its framework, Lightchain AI has a unique competitive advantage that could lead to exponential adoption across industries.

37173022,https://coinpedia.org/?p=388697,1733233232,Best Crypto 2025—Dogizen’s World First ICO Strategy Has Degens Aping In,"The post Best Crypto 2025—Dogizen’s World First ICO Strategy Has Degens Aping In appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News There are already murmurs that an altcoin season could be underway . Other voices are saying the party should start early next year. Either way, now is the time to allocate. The Telegram gaming platform Dogizen , with its unique ICO approach and position within one of the hottest sectors right now, makes it the ideal pick. Dogizen has already raised $1.4m and is offering 47.30% gains before the presale concludes. The best crypto 2025 is staring you right in the face. Why Dogizen is ready to seize the best crypto 2025 crown For starters, Dogizen employs the unique approach of delivering its ICO directly to Telegram’s 950 million user base . No ICO has ever done this before. For the first time, ICO investors can buy, claim, and hold their tokens within one familiar interface. Given Telegram’s high levels of trust within the crypto space , this is the ultimate platform to launch an ICO on. Also, Dogizen is sitting within a bit of a golden sector right now: Telegram gaming. These new games are contained within the Telegram app and don’t require additional downloading. Their simple, addictive nature and ability to earn crypto for the players is onboarding crypto newbies at a phenomenal rate . Plus, according to a recent report by Game7 , 21% of new Web3 game launches happened on Telegram in 2024. That clearly explains Telegram gaming’s surge to around $1.5 billion in market cap in around six months. Telegram’s popularity in the developing world is set to grow, and combined with the power of Telegram games, the next 1 billion users piling into crypto could well have Telegram to thank. Why Dogizen has a superior strategy to its rivals Besides its unique ICO approach, Dogizen has caught degens’ attention thanks to its superior approach to tokenomics. Dogizen’s key rivals, such as Notcoin and Hamster Kombat, have all reached considerable market caps: $500 million to over a billion in some cases . However, since these projects distributed tokens via airdrop, recipients were basically given free money and dumped the tokens immediately. Tanking the price in the process. Dogizen has seen this error a mile away and is slowly building loyal support with its ICO instead. Plus, Dogizen aims for its market cap to be around $10 million upon listing. Considering the multiple hundreds of millions Dogizen can expect its market cap to be after looking at its rivals, there’s ample room for the DOGIZ token to pump on the open market. As the bull run builds, altcoin season soars, and Dogizen’s market cap starts to emulate its peers; 100x for today’s presale investors looks highly likely. You can buy DOGIZ on the official Dogizen website .",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | ZRX | TOKEN SALE,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/best-crypto-2025-dogizens-world-first-ico-strategy-has-degens-aping-in/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Paul Atkins, a former SEC Commissioner known for his pro-crypto views and innovative approach, is the favorite to succeed Gensler as the new SEC Chair. Trump Expected To Name New SEC Chair While Atkins is the favorite, Trump’s transition team is weighing several candidates. However, betting odds are stacked heavily in favor of Atkins. Current SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda, Heath Tarbert, a former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and Robert Stebbins, a partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, are also being considered for the position. A spokesperson for Trump stated, “President-Elect Trump has made brilliant decisions on who will serve in his second Administration at lightning pace. Remaining decisions will continue to be announced by him when they are made.” Irrespective of whoever is selected for the job, the SEC will likely change its approach to cryptocurrencies, financial markets, and corporate oversight. The SEC under Gary Gensler was known for its enforcement action and was defined by lawsuits and greater regulatory scrutiny, leading to industry-wide frustration. The agency filed several lawsuits against major players in the crypto space, including Coinbase and Binance, accusing them of operating unregistered securities exchanges. Gensler’s leadership style also saw him make enemies within the SEC, leading to high attrition rates. Critics, including members of Congress, called him “heavy-handed” and “out of touch.” Betting Favorite Traders on Kalshi favor Paul Atkins, a former SEC Commissioner, as the leading candidate for the SEC Chair. Atkins has seen support rise significantly following his interview with Trump’s transition team, with polls giving him a 70% probability of appointment. Atkins is significantly ahead of second-placed Brian Brooks, who stands a 20% chance of being named SEC Chair. Atkins is known for his pro-crypto stance and has been critical of the SEC’s regulation-by-enforcement approach under Gensler. He has advocated clear regulations for the crypto space and a regulatory framework that promotes innovation. If appointed, Atkins could bring a balanced approach to crypto regulation in the US and play a key role in shaping regulatory compliance.

37172971,https://coinpaper.com/6357/coinbase-boosts-crypto-adoption-with-apple-pay-integration,1733233034,Coinbase Boosts Crypto Adoption with Apple Pay Integration,"This week, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has captured the attention of the financial world with two major updates. In a move aimed at enhancing user experience, the company has announced the integration of Apple Pay into its Onramp app services. This exciting development is set to make cryptocurrency transactions significantly more accessible for millions of users, streamlining the process and encouraging broader adoption of digital currencies. On the other hand, Coinbase has also made headlines by withdrawing its pre-application to enter the Turkish cryptocurrency market. This decision marks a notable shift in its international expansion plans. Coinbase Fully Integrates Apple Pay into Onramp App Services, Elevating Crypto Accessibility In a move that signals further convergence between traditional finance and the cryptocurrency ecosystem, Coinbase, the leading US-based cryptocurrency exchange, announced the full integration of Apple Pay into its Onramp app services. This development, effective from Dec. 2, allows users logging into apps built on Coinbase’s Onramp platform to seamlessly transact using Apple Pay. The integration simplifies crypto transactions for millions of Apple Pay users, presenting a significant leap in user accessibility and convenience. Coinbase has positioned this as a key feature requiring no additional setup from app developers, making it a plug-and-play enhancement to its Onramp ecosystem. Apple Pay and the Evolution of Crypto Payments Apple Pay’s foray into cryptocurrency isn’t unprecedented, with integrations already established across platforms like Binance, BitPay, and MetaMask. However, its incorporation into Coinbase’s services holds particular significance due to Coinbase’s dominance in the US cryptocurrency exchange market. Social media platforms, including X, have been abuzz with optimism following the announcement. Influencer Asser Fawzi encapsulated the sentiment, describing the move as a potential “tipping point” for broader crypto adoption, citing the ease and security associated with Apple Pay as major factors that could bring new users into the digital asset space. Coinbase Onramp aims to streamline cryptocurrency adoption for users and developers by removing technical barriers. Apple Pay’s integration aligns with this mission, leveraging iOS’s extensive user base to provide a familiar and secure entry point for Web3 transactions. This step could prove especially disruptive to traditional financial systems as it offers: Ease of Use: Apple Pay’s intuitive interface reduces the friction often associated with crypto transactions. Enhanced Security: The integration adds a layer of trust for crypto-curious users hesitant about blockchain’s perceived complexity. Regulatory Compliance: Coinbase Onramp supports transactions in over 60 fiat currencies while adhering to regulations, fostering a sense of legitimacy. Zero Fees for USD Coin (USDC): Users benefit from free on-ramp and off-ramp transactions involving USDC, Coinbase’s native stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. The Onramp service already supports over 100 cryptocurrencies and more than 20 blockchains, making it a versatile tool for developers and users. Apple Pay’s ubiquity in traditional finance systems means its integration with Coinbase could be a turning point in the mainstream adoption of digital assets. As Coinbase Onramp simplifies blockchain interactions for average users, the crypto industry could witness a shift in demographics, welcoming users less familiar with the intricacies of blockchain technology. Experts believe this move could foster deeper trust and understanding of cryptocurrencies, addressing key adoption bottlenecks by providing secure and seamless payment options. The integration of Apple Pay with Coinbase Onramp represents more than just a technological update—it’s a paradigm shift for the cryptocurrency sector. By marrying the accessibility of traditional payment systems with the revolutionary potential of blockchain, Coinbase is setting the stage for a new wave of adoption. As developers and users begin to leverage these capabilities, the industry may see greater trust and participation from mainstream consumers. However, challenges such as regulatory scrutiny and uneven global market penetration remain hurdles Coinbase and its peers must navigate carefully. Whether this move becomes the much-needed catalyst for mass adoption or simply another step in crypto’s slow march toward the mainstream, one thing is certain: Coinbase is solidifying its position as a bridge between the worlds of traditional and digital finance. Coinbase Withdraws Application for Turkish Crypto Market Amid Unclear Circumstances In a related development, Coinbase has officially withdrawn its pre-application to enter the Turkish cryptocurrency market. According to documents released by the Turkish Capital Markets Board (CMB), Coinbase also requested liquidation of its position in the country, marking a sudden halt to its previously announced expansion plans. This development follows a broader trend of companies reassessing their strategies in Turkey’s rapidly growing cryptocurrency ecosystem. While Coinbase has yet to provide specific reasons for its decision, the move has sparked widespread speculation about the challenges and opportunities in one of the world’s most active cryptocurrency markets. Coinbase initially filed its pre-application with the CMB in August, joining over 90 enterprises vying to tap into Turkey’s burgeoning crypto scene. The country ranks fourth globally in terms of cryptocurrency trading volume and holds the 11th spot on the 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index by Chainalysis. This market appeal stems from Turkey’s unique economic dynamics, where rapid inflation and currency devaluation have driven citizens to seek financial stability through cryptocurrencies. The Turkish lira's volatility has made Bitcoin, stablecoins, and altcoins popular hedging instruments among the population. Despite this favorable backdrop, Coinbase’s decision to withdraw its application and request liquidation signals potential underlying issues. While the exact motives remain undisclosed, several factors could have influenced Coinbase’s decision: Regulatory Challenges:Turkey has been tightening its regulatory framework for cryptocurrency exchanges, requiring them to meet stringent compliance standards. These include anti-money laundering measures, tax reporting obligations, and minimum capital requirements. Navigating these regulations could have presented significant operational challenges for Coinbase. Market Competition:The Turkish crypto market is already crowded, with established local players like BtcTurk and Paribu commanding a significant share. Additionally, international exchanges such as Binance and KuCoin have made inroads, intensifying competition. Economic Uncertainty:While crypto adoption in Turkey is high, the nation’s broader economic instability could pose risks for foreign businesses, particularly those in highly volatile sectors like digital assets. Strategic Reprioritization:A statement from a Coinbase spokesperson suggests that the withdrawal aligns with a broader strategy to adapt to evolving market conditions. The spokesperson noted:“Coinbase continually assesses potential markets for expansion as part of our commitment to providing safe, reliable, and accessible cryptocurrency services worldwide. Our strategy remains adaptive to evolving market conditions, regulatory landscapes, and our internal priorities.” The Bigger Picture: Challenges in Turkey’s Crypto Landscape Coinbase is not alone in reassessing its position in Turkey. Recent reports indicate that at least 14 applicants, including prominent exchanges like Bitget, have withdrawn their submissions to the CMB. This trend comes amidst what some analysts describe as growing friction between regulators and the crypto industry. Turkey has taken proactive steps to regulate the space, introducing new laws and oversight mechanisms. However, these measures, while aimed at ensuring consumer protection and financial stability, have also created an environment of heightened scrutiny and operational hurdles for incoming players. Despite these challenges, Turkey remains a critical market in the global crypto landscape. Its large, tech-savvy population, combined with a strong demand for alternative financial instruments, positions it as a key player in shaping the future of cryptocurrency adoption. Coinbase’s decision to pull back from Turkey may be a temporary pause rather than a permanent exit. As the global regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies continues to evolve, companies like Coinbase are likely to adopt a cautious and measured approach to international expansion. For Turkey, the withdrawals by Coinbase and other major players bring attention to the need for a balanced regulatory framework that encourages innovation while ensuring compliance.

The re-election of Donald Trump and the impending resignation of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler are key catalysts driving renewed interest in XRP. On-chain metrics and blockchain usage data suggest mixed fundamentals supporting XRP's recent performance surge. The biggest question is what are investors willing to pay today for tomorrow's potential? At a $262 billion fully diluted market cap, XRP is more 'valuable' than Wells Fargo. When I covered the XRP/Ripple USD ( XRP-USD ) for Seeking Alpha back in March, the coin had been lagging the broader smart contract segment in the digital asset market. I hypothesized that XRP was lagging for a reason, and cited several data points that I felt justified that assertion. Things change. Not only is XRP no longer lagging other smart contract gas tokens, but in just three weeks, XRP has rapidly morphed from a laggard to a top-performing asset over the last 12 months: Data by YCharts On November 6th, XRP's 12-month performance was negative 10%. Fast-forward to December 1st; the token has a 12-month return approaching 300% and has also taken out both Solana ( SOL-USD ) and Tether ( USDT-USD ) for the number 3 spot on CoinMarketCap's asset valuation list after Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). CoinMarketCap Justified? Let's try to find out. In this update, we'll dive into possible news-related catalysts that could be driving this move and review many of the same blockchain usage metrics that I shared in my March piece. Potential News-Related Catalysts Perhaps one of the biggest reasons exuberance has returned to the 'alt-coin' market in recent weeks is the re-election of former US President Donald Trump. Something that was generally foreshadowed by myself and others over the summer was that President Trump was clearly positioning to be the friendlier candidate for the digital asset market. Subsequent to Trump's victory last month, US Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler announced he would be stepping down on inauguration day. Gensler's SEC has been widely viewed as antagonistic to the cryptocurrency industry, and the agency developed a reputation for being 'capricious and arbitrary' in addition to being active from a litigation standpoint. The latter of which has specifically had an impact on XRP Ledger developer Ripple Labs. In my view, President Trump's re-election and Gary Gensler's eventual resignation are two very positive catalysts for Ripple Labs and by extension XRP token holders. We've also seen several applications for XRP ETFs from companies like Bitwise and 21Shares. Monthly Stablecoin Transfer Volume (IntoTheBlock) That said, the bigger catalyst may be the planned launch and potential regulatory approval of the RLUSD stablecoin on the XRP Ledger. The chart above is showing the monthly transfer volume currently seen on EVM blockchains on a monthly basis. Monthly volume surpassed $1 trillion for the 3rd time in the last 5 months in November. Total stablecoin supply recently hit a new record of $192 billion last month, per data from IntoTheBlock. Stablecoins are a very important part of the public blockchain ecosystem, as they allow end users the ability to swap out of digital currencies into something with more perceived stability on-chain without requiring a centralized exchange. Furthermore, stablecoin payments allow P2P transactions with a familiar unit of account on public blockchain rails. This opens up the possibility of quick, inexpensive cross-border settlement at scale. With hypothetical catalysts seemingly flashing 'bullish,' the bigger question for me is what the actual on-chain data is saying. On-Chain Metrics In my March article, I chose not to compare daily active addresses between XRP and top L1 smart contract chains like Solana or Ethereum because, frankly, the number for XRP is substantially lower and there are perhaps better historical peers. In the chart below, I'm showing XRP Ledger against Algorand ( ALGO-USD ) and Stellar ( XLM-USD ): 30 Day Active Addresses (CoinMetrics) The chart above shows the 10+ year trend in 30 day active addresses for all three chains mentioned above. During the 2022 spikes in usage, each of these chains had very similar levels of active users. However, more recently, the XRP Ledger has not been able to maintain the same level of average active user growth as the other two chains: Chain 30 Day Actives Fully Diluted Cap Ripple 54.9k $262.6b Stellar 174.6k $30b Algorand 130.8k $4.9b Sources: CoinMetrics, CoinMarketCap, as of 12/2/24 If we compare 30 day active users against the fully diluted market capitalizations for each of the three chains listed above, we can get a much better sense of what the market is paying for the level of users currently being served by the XRP Ledger. If we look at XRP based purely on value transferred, the spike in recent weeks is quite significant: 30 Day Average Transferred Value (CoinMetrics) At a 30-day average of $38.3 billion in transferred value, XRP is a large standout. It is currently averaging more daily transferred value than Bitcoin and Ethereum combined. However, even with this enormous move higher in transferred value, the fees paid to the XRP Ledger network are still well below top chains in the market like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana. Consider, at $24k in fees on December 1st, XRP is trading at an annualized price to fees ratio of 29,977x fully diluted fees. For comparison's sake, Solana trades at 59x fully diluted fees and Ethereum trades at a 188 fully diluted P/F multiple. Risks In Chasing Here Elaborating on some of my points above, investors have to ask themselves what their valuation framework is and what they're willing to pay for any digital asset based on that valuation framework. My own framework may differ from what is generally accepted in the broader cryptocurrency market, but something that I think everyone in the space should be mindful of is the market value to realized value of these assets. This ratio shows the valuation the market is giving each token over what has actually been paid for those tokens on average. The more extreme this ratio gets to the upside, the greater the likelihood of a pullback. MVRV (CoinMetrics) The chart above shows the raw, unsmoothed MVRV for XRP, XLM, ALGO, BTC and ETH going back to the beginning of 2020. At a MVRV ratio of 2.66 on December 1st, XRP has the second highest MVRV ratio today of the assets shown (after only XLM) and is at the highest level XRP has traded since the 2.88 MVRV reading back in April 2021. This happened to coincide with when the price of the XRP token peaked during the last crypto bull cycle. Closing Takeaways The regulatory environment appears to be quickly improving for the US crypto industry. The report of impending NYDFS approval of RLUSD is also significant because the XRP Ledger has long been positioned as an alternative to the SWIFT system. But I believe these gains in the XRP token are more indicative of excitement from regulatory catalysts than anything else. The on-chain data doesn't justify this enormous price move in the XRP token, in my view. On one hand, transferred value has been surging. But on the other hand, what is the right price for a token that doesn't generate rewards from staking? At a fully diluted market capitalization of $262 billion, the market is implying XRP token is more valuable than Wells Fargo ( WFC ) and American Express ( AXP ). I can't say I think that's justified today. I should note that I do have indirect exposure to XRP through the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund ( GDLC ). That fund has a 4% allocation to XRP and is one of the only ways that I'm aware of to get exposure to XRP through a traditional brokerage account if one wishes to do so. I'm not going to call XRP a sell at this point, but I'm certainly not chasing this rally.",POSITIVE,ETH | XRP,ETH | MARKET | TRADING | WALLET | XRP,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4741666-ripple-surging-for-a-reason?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37172841.jpeg

37172829,https://nulltx.com/?p=135117,1733232510,Will XRP Break $5 This Crypto Bull Run Amidst JetBolt Surge and Whale Interest?,"Ripple’s XRP and JetBolt (JBOLT) are standing in the face of an exhilarating crypto bull run. But even before this potential market surge materializes, XRP has begun its parabolic run with a $2 climb. After coming in late to the market-wide crypto rally party after the US elections, XRP is now beginning to redeem itself, buoyed by fresh and favorable market developments. Alongside XRP, young altcoin JetBolt is blazing ahead of the potential bull run with its explosive presale, selling more than 100 million tokens since its debut. Its groundbreaking feature, zero-gas technology is also capturing massive whale interest. With the bull run underway, could JetBolt reach new heights in presale figures, and can XRP record a fresh all-time high at $5? Let’s find out. XRP Price Forecast: Is XRP Heading Towards a Long-Awaited $5 Breakout? Ripple’s XRP is on a tear. After witnessing somewhat bearish investor actions and a stagnant price movement after revisiting the $1 mark, XRP is again hitting the green on the price charts. Over the past 24 hours, XRP’s 6% rise seems to be a continuation of its rally, which started on December 2nd. At press time, XRP is trading at $2.58—a value that the third-largest cryptocurrency has only seen after six long years. XRP’s 24-hour price chart shows its notable price pump over $2.80 on December 3, 2024 — source: CoinMarketCap website With its bullish charge, is XRP en route to the $5 mark? Technically, XRP needs to keep its upward trajectory above $2.58. A successful hold above this level could push a rally to a high of $3.57. In summary, XRP smashing $5 is not impossible. However, the cryptocurrency would need to maintain current buying momentum alongside other favorable market conditions. Despite positive prospects for the RLUSD stablecoin, New York’s Department of Financial Services has not officially confirmed its approval yet. XRP would also need to overcome the challenges that would reflect in its on-chain metrics, stalling its climb to $5. Is JetBolt (JBOLT) The Rising Star of the Next Bull Run? While XRP’s target to register a fresh ATH at $5 could face delays, JetBolt (JBOLT) is surging ahead of the anticipated crypto bull run. This hot market newcomer has sold over 100 million tokens since its presale commenced—a herculean milestone for such a young presale coin. Behind the narrative of growing whale interest in JetBolt are its real and innovative features that challenge the status quo. While clogged blockchain networks could sometimes charge hefty gas fees in transactions, JetBolt offers game-changing zero-gas technology. This high-tech feature enables users to carry out hassle-free and gas-free transactions, bringing down the traditional barrier of expensive gas costs. Beyond seamless transactions, JetBolt takes the complexity out of staking tokens with its easy-to-use crypto-staking platform. It also adds a layer of excitement to staking by giving stakers a chance to earn bonus rewards when they connect with friends on the platform. Moreover, JetBolt taps the potential of merging blockchain technology with AI. JetBolt provides token holders with crypto news and blockchain trends via its AI-powered tool. Aside from these cutting-edge innovations, JetBolt could be pulling in whales and crypto buyers to its exciting presale because of presale advantages. Early movers could get an exclusive chance to enjoy up to 25% extra tokens when they purchase Alpha Boxes or acquire JetBolt (JBOLT) tokens in batches. As whales flock to accumulate JBOLT, the presale frenzy indicates growing confidence in its capability to shine among other coins in the next bull run. Conclusion — XRP Eyes $5 Price Target While JetBolt Gains Massive Whale Traction Ripple’s XRP has been witnessing an impressive run lately, bolstered by positive market developments. While it is not impossible, it could take a while for XRP to smash $5. Meanwhile, fresh entrant JetBolt’s electrifying rise is hard to ignore. Bursting onto the crypto scene with a presale that has sold over 100 million tokens, JetBolt continues to gain interest from blockchain whales seeking revolutionary next-gen altcoins.

This rise has sparked speculation about the token’s year-end potential, fueled by bullish market sentiment, whale activity, and institutional adoption. At the time of writing, LINK was trading at $24.71, posting a 24% gain in the past 24 hours. On a broader scale, the token has soared 127% this month, pushing its market capitalization to an impressive $15 billion . Link one-day price chart. Source: Finbold What’s driving LINK’s momentum? The recent price spike for Chainlink is partly attributed to the success of XRP , which surged to $2.7 on December 2 before stabilizing. XRP’s momentum, fueled by optimism around Ripple’s stablecoin initiatives and expectations of improved U.S. regulatory conditions, has indirectly drawn attention to LINK. According to Aylo , an advisor at Kamino Finance , XRP’s rally may spotlight Chainlink’s partnerships with traditional finance, reinforcing the notion that LINK could act as a bridge between blockchain and capital markets. Adding to the bullish sentiment, fintech firm 21X announced the adoption of Chainlink’s infrastructure for tokenized securities in Europe. This integration highlights Chainlink’s pivotal role in advancing blockchain adoption in one of the most regulated financial markets globally. Chainlink’s positioning as a universal gas token, enabling fee payments in LINK with a 10% discount for high-volume users, is also increasing its utility and demand. Solutions like CCIP v1.6 streamline payments for developers, reinforcing LINK’s importance in the blockchain ecosystem and driving its future growth. Whale activity and derivatives data Data from LookonChain reveals a notable Chainlink whale bagged nearly $6 million worth of the token, sparking optimism about the asset’s future movements. The price of $LINK has surged 36% today! A whale bought 269,861 $LINK ($6.68M) in the past 12 hours. The whale spent $2.6M to buy 107,838 $LINK at $24.1 on DEX and withdrew 162,024 $LINK ($4.08M) from #Binance . https://t.co/Zuxgpk23Sm pic.twitter.com/hNQ65oZkfi — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 3, 2024 Derivatives data from CoinGlass also paints a bullish sentiment for Chainlink based on key market metrics.

37172722,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373185,1733232297,Ripple Meme Coins Witness Unprecedented Growth on the Back of XRP Surge,"Ripple’s XRP Ledger (XRPL) is becoming a focal point for crypto enthusiasts, with meme tokens like ARMY, 589, XPILL, PHNIX, and RIPPIE seeing remarkable upticks. The surge comes in the wake of a resurgence in Ripple’s own XRP token, which is up 88% in the last seven days, a feat that catapulted it into the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. ARMY Kickstarts Charge The initial XRPL meme coin charge was led by ARMY, a token that has been around for roughly one and a half years. It is inspired by the huge XRP community, popularly referred to as the “XRP Army.” Data from Dexscreener shows that over the past week, ARMY’s market cap grew from less than a million dollars to a staggering $90 million at its peak before stabilizing around the $47 million level. However, it has since dropped further, losing more than half its value across 24 hours. Still, its $26.3 million valuation marks it as the highest-capped meme coin on the XRPL ecosystem. Early investors profited handsomely from the meme coin’s initial jump, with one trader reportedly turning a $478 buy into more than half a million in realized and unrealized gains in less than three weeks. Another token that caught on quickly was 589, named after the community’s aspirational price target for XRP. It reached a market cap of $8 million at one point, fueled by a 160% price spike within 24 hrs. However, at the time of writing, it was changing hands at about $0.0005513, bringing its overall value down to $2.9 million. Newer Meme Coins Gain Momentum ARMY’s success and XRP’s pump in the broader crypto market have inspired tens of new meme coins on XRPL, several of which have registered incredible performances in the last 24 hours. Dexscreener shows that the best-performing XRP meme coin in the last day was RIPPY, which skyrocketed by an eye-popping 22,825% at one point. At the time of writing, the token, which is only days old, was still up by some 17,694%, with its price around $0.00116, placing its market cap around the $1.1 million range. The second-best XRP meme token was XPILL, up 13,128%, per Dexscreener, with a modest $88,000 valuation. Another new coin, PHNIX, has also shot up by more than 12,000% since its launch. SAM, bwif, RIPPIE, and NOX have also recorded upticks above 1,000% over 24 hours, with bwif performing particularly well in the last six hours, having gained 7,710% on its price in that period. The growth of these XRPL tokens hasn’t gone unnoticed, with influential traders from Ethereum and Solana now exploring the chain and even offering tutorials to guide new participants on how to trade meme coins on Ripple.

37172734,https://coinpedia.org/?p=388671,1733232291,Ethereum Bulls in Action; Analysts Point to This Altcoin for the Next Big Wave,"The post Ethereum Bulls in Action; Analysts Point to This Altcoin for the Next Big Wave appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum recently jumped above $3,600, indicating serious buying pressure as bullish crypto market sentiments keep flourishing. Analysts believe the crypto bull market is coming in waves, and Ethereum is riding the current wave to the hilt. Other coins like Solana also rode the current wave, but investors are looking forward to the next big wave and which coins will take full advantage of it. Rollblock is an exciting prospect for this upcoming bullish era, and this article discusses why it is set to be the next big crypto. Trailblazing Rollblock eyes long-term success Rollblock is a surging crypto presale, but unlike most ICOs, it already has a working product. It powers a world-class online crypto casino, which is home to thousands of active users. Savvy investors have noticed its unique blend of blockchain with iGaming features, and they are rushing its presale in droves. As a result of these features, Rollblock has gone up by more than 350% even though it is still in presale. It’s currently priced at $0.037, with loads of room for further growth. However, Rollblock is an ambitious project, and it takes its long-term success quite seriously. This is evident in its deflationary tokenomics and a revenue-sharing model that rewards RBLK holders. Rollblock introduces scarcity to preserve the value of the token while at the same time fostering a strong community of users, which will be instrumental to its long-term success. As the next bullish crypto wave draws nearer, Rollblock is well-armed to take full advantage of it. That is why it is well-positioned to be the next big crypto token. Ethereum rally sparks hope of a new all-time high Ethereum has appreciated remarkably in recent months, with its price steadily rising since September. When Bitcoin pulled back after hitting almost $100K, crypto bulls shifted their focus to Ethereum. That is why the ETH price prediction is extremely bullish at the moment. Numerous signals suggest ETH could cross $4,000 and rise to new levels. An examination of past bull cycles shows that ETH often hit this milestone approximately a month after Bitcoin. Since Bitcoin’s last rally saw it hit a new all-time high, there’s a chance Ethereum could do the same thing in the coming weeks. Capitalizing on the next big crypto wave Bitcoin crossing $100,000 would easily usher in the next crypto wave, and this seems to be quite inevitable. It could even happen sooner than expected because BTC is now above $95,000. That is why the ETH price prediction suggests ETH could rise as high as $5,000 in the near future. Nevertheless, Ethereum has a rather high entry price. Investors cannot really afford ETH, and the coin also has a pretty limited potential to fetch substantial gains percentage-wise. This is why Rollblock is a superior investment choice. At an affordable entry price of $0.037, investing in RBLK won’t put a hole in your pocket. Apart from that, RBLK is billed to rise by 800% during the presale stages alone. The project’s aim is to dominate its niche, a market that is worth over half a trillion dollars. Capturing just 1% of the market share would see its price go to the moon. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

37172663,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373257,1733232201,Dogecoin Price Stalls But Could Accumulating Whales Lead to Another DOGE Bull Rally?,"TL:DR; Dogecoin was one of the top performers in the first few weeks after the US elections but has lost its momentum and is a modest 10% up in the past seven days. However, whales continue to accumulate the meme coin, which could lead to further gains in the near future. DOGE’s Current State and Whales Buying Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential elections in early November resulted in immediate price gains for several crypto assets, including the largest meme coin. This is most likely because of Elon Musk’s role in the future administration, where he is expected to run a new Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) branch. DOGE’s price nearly tripled in the first few weeks amid the massive growth in the transactions on the network. Moreover, the meme coin surpassed XRP at one point, but that all changed as the roles reversed . While Ripple’s native token is exploring new heights not seen in over six years, DOGE has stalled to an extent and sits just over $0.4 after being rejected at $0.44 on a few occasions. Nevertheless, Dogecoin whales seem unfazed by the lack of price action as of late. Data from Santiment, shared by popular analyst Ali, indicates that these large investment entities have accumulated another 160 million DOGE during the weekend alone. #Dogecoin whales bought an additional 160 million $DOGE during the weekend! pic.twitter.com/OACjFVIv9N — Ali (@ali_charts) December 2, 2024 Recall that the last time whales went on a shopping spree for DOGE, the asset’s price exploded in the next month or so. Can DOGE Resume its Bull Run? Many analysts continue to be bullish on DOGE, with some predicting a new all-time high around the corner. One of the recent forecasts from dogegod sees the asset skyrocketing to $2.2, which would be roughly three times higher than the current ATH reached back in 2021. Javon_Marks had a similar target in mind. The strategist said Dogecoin is “in the midst of its 3rd Bull Cycle performance,” which could propel a massive surge of over 400%. In case such a rally transpires, it would place DOGE’s price at around $2.28. $DOGE (Dogecoin) looks to be in midst of its 3rd Bull Cycle performance and based on prior cyclical displays in price, according to Fibonacci Extension, prices can be poised for a move to and above the 1.618 Fib Extension level, which is currently over 405% away at $2.28 pic.twitter.com/I6AgRead8Y — JAVON MARKS (@JavonTM1) December 1, 2024 The post Dogecoin Price Stalls But Could Accumulating Whales Lead to Another DOGE Bull Rally? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",POSITIVE,DOGE | XRP,DOGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,Crypto Potato,https://cryptopotato.com/dogecoin-price-stalls-but-could-accumulating-whales-lead-to-another-doge-bull-rally/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/37172663.jpeg

US Companies Take Back!,"While it was expected that cryptocurrency supporters would be appointed to critical positions after Donald Trump's re-election, a radical step came from Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has announced that he will be severing ties with law firms that hire anti-cryptocurrency officials. Coinbase Exchange CEO X announced in a post on his account that Coinbase will no longer work with law firms that hire people involved in anti-crypto activities during their tenure and that they will cut ties. Armstrong cited Milbank, which hired former SEC enforcement director Gurbir Grewal, as an example. Armstrong also stated that Coinbase has terminated its relationship with Milbank, which hired SEC Enforcement Division Director Gurbir S. Grewal, citing Coinbase’s involvement in enforcement actions against the cryptocurrency industry. Urging the crypto community not to support those working against the industry, Armstrong said: “We have made it known to all the law firms we work with: If they hire anyone who committed bad acts in the previous administration, we will no longer be their client. For example, Milbank recently made a mistake and hired Gurbir. We no longer work with them (and never will as long as he works there). Trying to illegally kill an industry while refusing to publish clear rules is a violation of ethics in my book. Let your law firms know that hiring these people means losing you as a client.” We've let all the law firms we work with know, that if they hire anyone who committed these bad deeds in the (soon to be) prior administration, we will no longer be a client of theirs.

However, as the industry matures, new contenders are emerging with the potential to surpass these giants. Among them is Lightchain Protocol AI, an innovative blockchain that combines scalability, sustainability, and artificial intelligence (AI) to redefine decentralized technology. With its mainnet launch planned for mid-2025, Lightchain AI is already capturing the attention of analysts and investors, positioning itself as the blockchain to watch for massive growth potential in December 2024. Early adopters can join the Lightchain presale to secure Lightchain Tokens (LCAI) and get ahead of the next major blockchain wave. What Sets Lightchain AI Apart? While Ethereum has established itself as the go-to platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and Solana boasts impressive transaction speeds, Lightchain Protocol AI offers features that address the limitations of both platforms while adding groundbreaking innovations. Proof of Intelligence (PoI): A Smarter Consensus MechanismLightchain AI introduces a unique Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, which secures the network by incentivizing nodes to perform AI-driven computations such as machine learning tasks and data analysis. This eliminates the need for energy-intensive mining, making the network sustainable and purpose-driven. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): Pioneering AI IntegrationThe AIVM enables developers to create intelligent dApps that can leverage AI capabilities for predictive analytics, automated decision-making, and real-time insights. This feature makes Lightchain AI a powerful alternative to traditional blockchain platforms. Scalability Without LimitsUnlike Ethereum, which has faced challenges with network congestion and high gas fees, Lightchain AI employs advanced sharding and Layer 2 solutions to handle thousands of transactions per second. This ensures a smooth and cost-effective user experience, even as adoption grows. Why Analysts Are Excited About Lightchain AI’s Growth Potential Unmatched Scalability and SpeedSolana’s speed has been its claim to fame, but its network reliability issues have left room for competitors. Lightchain AI’s architecture ensures both speed and stability, making it a robust solution for enterprise-grade applications. AI Integration: A Game-ChangerWhile Ethereum focuses on dApp development, it lacks built-in AI capabilities. Lightchain AI’s seamless integration of AI positions it as a next-gen blockchain, ready to meet the demands of emerging industries like healthcare, logistics, and finance. Sustainability and Green Blockchain InnovationAs environmental concerns grow, Lightchain AI’s eco-friendly PoI mechanism aligns with global sustainability goals, attracting eco-conscious investors and developers. Early Entry OpportunityWith its mainnet launch set for mid-2025, December 2024 marks a prime time to invest in Lightchain AI as it gains momentum and builds its ecosystem. Early investors in the Lightchain Tokens (LCAI) presale stand to benefit significantly from the platform’s anticipated adoption. Real-World Applications Driving Adoption DeFi Platforms:Lightchain AI’s AI-powered capabilities enable smarter lending, risk analysis, and portfolio optimization, setting a new benchmark for decentralized finance. Healthcare Innovation:The platform supports secure, privacy-focused data sharing, while AI tools enhance diagnostics and research, transforming the healthcare industry. Global Supply Chain Solutions:With real-time AI-driven analytics, Lightchain AI improves transparency, efficiency, and cost management in logistics networks. The Lightchain AI Advantage Over Ethereum and Solana While Ethereum leads in versatility and Solana excels in speed, Lightchain AI bridges the gap between these strengths and introduces new dimensions with its AI integration and sustainability features. Its ability to scale efficiently, minimize energy consumption, and address complex real-world challenges positions it as a serious contender for market leadership. Lightchain Protocol AI is setting a new standard for blockchain technology, combining the best features of existing platforms with transformative innovations. Secure your Lightchain Tokens (LCAI) during the presale and be part of a project that analysts believe could outpace Ethereum and Solana in the race for blockchain dominance.

Currently, Santa Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Pepe by entering its contract address – 2NefXDdBhUkVn7dXW5wxVtCHKHKE8uiRGUqZGxT5HAN8 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/santa-pepe-sanpepe-solana-memecoin-to-rally-19000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37172600,https://crypto.news/?p=14315776,1733231953,Pepe coin price could surge as Reddit Army plots to Pump,"Pepe coin price has been in a tight range in the past two weeks, as the previous rally took a breather. Cryptocurrency analysts are optimistic that the coin could stage another rally, helped by the Reddit Army, which is planning to pump it. There are rising odds that the Pepe ( PEPE ) price will see more activity after a popular Reddit channel pointed to a potential pump. According to a post in the Pepecryptocurrency channel, users will purchase Pepe coins on December 3 at noon EST. This is a notable event since the Subreddit has over 18,000 members. Reddit users plan to pump Pepe | source: Reddit The potential Pepe coin pump is happening as crypto analysts predicted that the coin was ripe for a strong bullish breakout. In an X post, Chandler Bing, a popular crypto expert, noted that the coin had formed a falling wedge and that it would soon stage a strong rally.

That lower side was notable because it was the upper side of the cup and handle pattern, which formed between May 2024 and November this year. A C&H pattern happens when an asset rises to a crucial resistance level, drops gradually, and forms a rounded bottom. It then rises and retests the initial resistance point. It is one of the most popular bullish patterns in the market. Similarly, a break and retest is a positive sign since it is a popular sign of a continuation. It normally happens when an asset breaks out and then resumes the continuation patterns. Pepe has also formed what looks like a bullish pennant chart pattern, which is made up of a long vertical line and a symmetrical triangle pattern. It normally results into a strong bullish breakout. It has also formed an inverse head and shoulders chart pattern, another positive sign. Therefore, there is a likelihood that it will continue rising in the next few days. A complete bullish breakout will be confirmed if the coin jumps above the year-to-date high. If that happens, it could jump by about 50% as bulls target the key resistance level at $0.000030. On the flip side, a drop below the support at $0.00001728 will invalidate the bullish view.

Bitcoin 1-week price chart. Source: Finbold With its market cap soaring and technical indicators flashing bullish signals, all eyes are on Bitcoin’s potential performance during the festive season. Could we see BTC hitting new milestones this Christmas? Bitcoin’s key levels to watch Bitcoin’s price momentum has been exceptional, with the cryptocurrency up 127% over the last year, outperforming Ethereum and more than half of the top 100 crypto assets. Trading above its 200-day simple moving average, BTC has enjoyed 18 green days in the last 30, signaling sustained bullish momentum. Key technical levels for Bitcoin include a support zone at $92,414, with resistance sitting just shy of the psychologically significant $100K mark at $98,523. Breaking through this resistance could pave the way for a monumental rally, while a failure to hold support may lead to a dip.

While this projection falls short of the six-figure price that many Bitcoin enthusiasts have been anticipating, it still underscores the cryptocurrency’s resilience in what has been a highly volatile year for financial markets. Diverging analyst opinions on BTC Not everyone is convinced that Bitcoin’s holiday season will be smooth sailing. On-chain analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted the formation of a potential head-and-shoulders pattern, which he warns could trigger a price correction down to $90,000.

Probably wipes everyone on a dip to $80K if it loses $90K. Probably ranges while neither has happened.” Finally, Michaël van de Poppe, another prominent analyst, remains bullish but patient, stating, “BTC still patiently waiting to break $98K to get ourselves into the magic wonderland of $100K+. If we do dip, regardless, then my areas stay unchanged. Good times are coming.” $BTC still patiently waiting to break $98K to get ourselves into the magic wonderland of $100K+.

However, market sentiment remains a double-edged sword.

This means new users can now fund their wallets with just 1 XRP instead of the previous 10 XRP. XRP Reserve Requirements Drastically Reduced The reserve change, implemented at 10:45 PM UTC, was confirmed on X by a pseudonymous XRP validator operator. The reduction aims to make the blockchain more accessible to users, especially those discouraged by the higher initial reserve. It also allows users to spend XRP previously locked in reserve accounts. The owner reserve, the amount needed for account-held objects like NFTs or trust lines, also dropped from 2 XRP to 0.2 XRP. XRP Ledger reserves just dropped! Activating an XRP account cost now 1 XRP Holding a Token Trustline only 0.2 XRP Excessive XRP is now freed up in your account that you can spend now!! pic.twitter.com/zbvw0zLexd — Vet (@Vet_X0) December 2, 2024 The reserve system’s primary purpose is to prevent spam accounts and excessive ledger growth, as highlighted by the XRP Ledger documentation. However, critics argue that the previous requirement slowed down adoption, prompting developers to push for change. The initiative to reduce the reserve began in October, with XRP Ledger developer WietseWind announcing on October 16 that XRPL Labs nodes had been configured to vote for a lower reserve requirement. Developers Support Lower Reserves Despite Concerns The move to lower reserves reflects a broader effort to enhance accessibility and attract new users, which are critical for expanding XRP Ledger’s ecosystem. This reserve reduction comes during a period of heightened activity for XRP. The cryptocurrency has grown, reaching $2.65, its highest level since February 2018. This resurgence aligns with optimism surrounding the broader crypto market and ongoing legal battles involving Ripple Labs, XRP’s founding team. Ripple Labs has been embroiled in a legal tussle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which claims XRP should have been registered as a security. Ripple has contested the claims, appealing a $125 million fine imposed as part of the dispute. Despite these challenges, XRP continues to grow, reflecting investor confidence in its long-term prospects. XRP has also seen remarkable growth recently, climbing 30% on Monday and overtaking USDT to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap . Trading at $2.63 at press time, the token’s value has increased by 77% in a week and over 375% in the past month, with its market cap reaching $137.4 billion. This growth follows XRP surpassing Solana in market cap over the weekend , signaling strong momentum for the cryptocurrency amid ongoing developments.

Shiba Inu Trader Says New SHIB Substitute Will Reach $16 Faster Than Expected, Currently at 12.5 Cents.","SHIB, the native token of Shiba Inu, has practically become a classic with its continuous hype and community push. This month alone, the asset was up 40%, and analysts forecast an exceptional increase of 200%. However, with the rise of Shiba Inu, a pertinent question arises – should the search for more fundamental investments, not speculative investments such as meme coins, begin? Embrace Rexas Finance , a game-changing project that can have real-world use cases that will easily outperform meme tokens such as SHIB. Now, let’s see why Rexas Finance could be the better investment and how Shiba Inu compares to it. Why Shiba Inu’s Price Changes - Real Change or Mere Insistence? Looking back, it is easy to understand how Shiba Inu attracted so many devoted fans, with meme coin supporters at the heart of it all. As specialists suggest, the price of SHIB will surpass $0.000119 and will be 200% more than what it is now in the coming month. This is great; however, the growth of most meme coins, such as SHIB, is largely driven by social speculation and social media advocacy instead of their usability. To be fair, SHIB hasn’t been performing poorly, with its price performance in the last thirty days being noteworthy for what it’s worth. But such gains, more often than not, are very volatile. Investors who want to gamble on sentiments or invest in a project that holds some real-world applicability and has the potential for value appreciation in the long term will have to go looking elsewhere. What Makes Rexas Finance (RXS) Worth Paying Attention To In contrast to Shiba Inu’s reliance on purely speculative trading, Rexas Finance takes a fundamentally different route. RXS is a token on the ERC20 platform that drives the tokenization of real assets, thus enabling investors to partly hold expensive assets like artwork, real estate, or commodities. Such a practical application makes RXS an intentional cryptocurrency capable of growth beyond the mere gimmick that meme coins are peddling. The Presale Making a Bang Rexas Finance has exhibited great prospects even in its presale stages. The presale has secured over $20 million by selling 283 million tokens in 8 stages. Currently, the token costs $0.125 in its 8th presale stage, which creates a good buying opportunity for early investors. In 2025, as per market sources, the token is speculated to be listed for $0.20 on Tier-1 exchanges, providing early investors a chance to secure double their investments when the token is listed. With the endorsement of the hype surrounding the market for SHIB, Rexas Finance has delivered confidence to real investors owing to its practical use cases and strong surroundings. Verification and Certification from Certik: The Trust-Building Mechanism for the Rexas Ecosystem’s Warranty of Security Security is the cornerstone of success for any cryptocurrency, and Rexas Finance has begun taking measures to earn investors’ trust. The project’s stakeholders recently underwent a rigorous Certik audit involving an in-depth observation of the smart contracts, ensuring the project’s reliability. This level of security puts RXS on a different pedestal and instills faith in retail and institutional investors alike regarding the platform’s economic stability On the other hand, meme coins such as SHIB do not provide the kind of security backbone serious investors would be looking for. In this case, RXS is a much better prospect for those seeking safety and transparency. Community Participation: Creating a Devoted Base of Investors Rexas Finance has focused heavily on engaging the community to grow the company. Its $1 million giveaway program is one such measure, having recorded over 353,000 participants. The giveaway seeks to reward 20 winners with $50,000 worth of RXS tokens each, which serves to engender excitement and loyalty in a fast-expanding community. Such initiatives speak of Rexas Finance’s concern for inclusivity and growth, distinguishing it from many other projects that rely solely on hype to capture attention. Conclusion Shiba Inu may be fun in the short run, but serious investors look for innovation and real-world value, which Rexas Finance offers. RXS has all the attributes of a strong track record, secure infrastructure, and practical applications, putting it in a position to surpass highly speculative meme-style coins like SHIB. If you want to invest in a cryptocurrency that offers both quick profits and great potential, Rexas Finance is the answer. Right now, at $0.125, this may be your last opportunity to get involved in a project set to change the game of asset management on blockchain technology for years to come.

A picture of the first bull to be traded on Solana AgriDex , a Solana-based real-world assets (RWA) marketplace and winner of the Stand With Crypto UK’s ‘Best Use Case’ Awards , made history this week by facilitating the world’s first trade of a live bull on the blockchain from Aurox Meats . The transaction was seamlessly executed through the AgriDex platform and recorded on the Solana blockchain. The bull comes from Gatcombe Park, the Princess Royal's herd. The White Park bull, Dinefwr Wyn, carries a lineage steeped in royal heritage, traced back to some of the most renowned bloodlines in the breed's history. “This historic transaction isn’t just bullish for Solana, it’s bullish for the entire global livestock market. AgriDex demonstrates how blockchain can bring greater accountability to the livestock trade, empowering farmers and suppliers while ensuring animal welfare standards are maintained,” said Henry Duckworth , Co-Founder and CEO of AgriDex. The Future of Solana Depends on Utility Memecoins may be fun, but Solana needs substance. While the blockchain’s speed, low fees, and scalability have fueled an explosion of memecoins, capturing retail traders and driving community engagement, the long-term health of the ecosystem depends on more than fleeting hype. Real-World Assets (RWA) present a transformative alternative and offer sustainable growth and real-world value. In early 2024, RWA emerged as the second most profitable crypto narrative , delivering an impressive 285.6% return. For a brief moment in February, it even surpassed memecoins. RWA has been gaining further popularity and is emerging as one of the main narratives of the upcoming bull run. AgriDex leverages the power of Solana’s blockchain to revolutionise livestock trading with transparency, efficiency, and fairness. By ensuring every transaction is fully trackable, the platform reduces fraud and price manipulation across global supply chains. Its near-instant settlements come with significantly lower fees—just 0.15% per trade side—compared to traditional methods that often charge several percentage points and take 4-6 days to settle transactions. The successful facilitation of the trade on the blockchain showcases AgriDex’s commitment to innovation and highlights its role as a platform driving the adoption of blockchain for agricultural and livestock trades globally. As illustrated in the graph below, the project is expected to generate 133 million in profit by the end of 2028. Source: AgriDex Revolutionalise the agricultural industry with blockchain Set to launch on December 4th , Agridex is revolutionising the $2.3 trillion global agricultural trade industry by tokenising the supply chain. AgriDex offers farmers instant settlements, drastically reduced transaction costs, and fraud-proof traceability using blockchain and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to enshrine legal contracts. The AgriDex Token ($AGRI) is launching at a valuation of $65 million and anticipates generating $53.28 million in trading fees by the end of 2026, supported by an expected net buy pressure of $39.2 million within two years. Blockchain technology is undeniably redefining the tech paradigm, but many have jumped on the trend solely for profit, often not solving a real-world problem. AgriDex, however, stands apart by delivering genuine utility, leveraging blockchain to drive meaningful impact and innovation in the agricultural sector. For instance, food fraud cost the UK £1.96 billion in 2021 and globally accounts for $30-40 Billion dollars in lost revenue. Food fraud is notoriously hard to detect with only 20% of suspected cases being reported. In the UK, of the 610 that were reported in 2021 there were only 16 successful prosecutions, or under 4%. Poor traceability and certificate verification The fraud highlighted above is enabled by the opacity of crossing multiple jurisdictions using wet contracts and poor visibility of origin for consumers. Dozens of different standards and certifications make it challenging to assure quality, origin and sustainability credentials. Source: AgriDex AgriDex solves the problem by providing an inclusive marketplace for all participants in the supply chain. It is driven by the immutable ledger of blockchain - that delivers trust, transparency, and accountability. The RWA platform built on Solana lowers the cost of food traded through it, increases choice, and delivers transparency, reducing fraud and verifying quality and origin and sustainability credentials. It is focused on solving critical issues with trading agricultural products and services including inefficiency, fraud, access to finance and insurance. AgriDex will create a fair and transparent financial system. The graph below illustrates the significant cost and time savings that AgriDex offers • Cost Savings: While traditional systems incur a cost of $1,125 per tonne of cocoa, AgriDex slashes this to just $660, highlighting a stark reduction in trade expenses.• Time Efficiency: Traditionally, such a transaction takes 65 days to complete, but with AgriDex, it's cut down to 40 days. This accelerated timeline demonstrates AgriDex’sefficiency. Source: AgriDex AgriDex is redefining the global agricultural trade industry by leveraging blockchain technology to create a transparent, efficient, and fraud-resistant marketplace. By reducing costs, cutting transaction times, and providing traceable records of quality, origin, and sustainability, the RWA platform on Solana addresses critical inefficiencies in the $2.3 trillion agricultural sector. As the first platform to successfully trade a live bull on Solana, AgriDex showcases the transformative potential of RWAs and sets a new standard for using blockchain to solve real-world problems, driving meaningful innovation and sustainable growth in agriculture.

42416910,ebefe7c1-7233-49ba-ba4b-e0d4145b284b,1733231504,Bitcoin's $100K Psychological Barrier May Require Multiple Attacks: Van Straten,"Human beings are emotional, and that's especially so in crypto markets. Round numbers are idolized much more than in traditional finance, and investors and traders are susceptible to panic-selling if price gains stall near a number with several zeros at the end.   At the same time, some traders look to front-run the exodus, stacking order books such that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Take, for example, bitcoin (BTC), which has again drawn up short at the so-called psychological $100,000 sell wall. While earlier analysis has pointed at profit-taking, capitulation from short-term holders and just not enough demand to take bitcoin higher, it's interesting — possibly even useful —to know if there's a recurring pattern.  An analysis of historical price movements based on data from Glassnode shows it usually takes multiple attempts to breach these psychological barriers. The analysis looked at trading patterns when the bitcoin price came within 2% of a multiple of $10,000.   Bitcoin closed above that level for the first time back in December 2017. After that bubble burst, BTC endured a bear market until 2020 as it struggled to reclaim the $10,000 price level. It closed within 2% of the barrier 21 times before it conclusively broke through. An earlier analysis shows that was one of bitcoin's longest trading periods within a specific price range.  Subsequent $10,000 increments each had the price closing within 2% between 15 and 30 times before climbing above the level. That was consistent all the way through $70,000.  The pattern unravels after President-elect Donald Trumps' election victory in November. Bitcoin shot though $80,000 and tested $90,000 only three times before the barrier crumbled.  Which leaves $100,000 in unknown territory. BTC has already closed twice within 2% of that level: Nov. 21 and Nov. 22. Are we about to revert to the long-term pattern of some 20 attempts, or will it be third time's a charm?",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/03/bitcoins-100-k-psychological-barrier-may-require-multiple-attacks-van-straten,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ee1f5bf47e6e073145740a8d8fb71525c8bf55f3-1600x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With over 200,000 holders already and a big listing coming soon on Binance, this coin is quickly growing in popularity. Investors are excited about its potential, and you might want to get in early before it becomes more well-known. In this article, we will discuss how this coin is different from XRP, why it's so popular, and what you need to know before jumping in. XRP surges to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency The XRP token, which is linked to Ripple Labs, has risen to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency in the world, based on its market cap. This happened after a long period of rising prices, starting with President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in November and the growing belief that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might drop its legal case against Ripple Labs. On Monday, the price of XRP reached a more than 21% increase in just 24 hours and nearly a 50% rise compared to last week. Since Trump’s election win, XRP’s market value has grown from about $30 billion to $131 billion. Over the weekend, XRP’s market cap crossed $100 billion for the first time since 2018, making it the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, surpassing Solana’s SOL. At one point, XRP even briefly overtook Tether’s USDT stablecoin in market value. However, it later settled just below it. Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency, has been valued at around $100,000 this past week, with a market cap of nearly $1.89 trillion. Ethereum’s Ether token follows with a market cap of $436 billion. What’s behind the surge in XRP’s price? While XRP’s price has been steadily climbing since Trump’s election, the big jump over the weekend happened after Fox Business reported that the New York Department of Financial Services might soon approve Ripple Labs' new RLUSD stablecoin. This stablecoin could be launched as early as December 4, which excited many investors and led to the price spike. Ripple Labs, the company behind XRP, was sued by the SEC in 2020. The SEC claimed that Ripple was selling XRP tokens as a security without registering them. In July of the previous year, a federal judge ruled that Ripple had not broken the law by selling XRP on public exchanges. However, in October, the SEC appealed this decision, which is still pending. The price surge happened partly because people believe that the new government, led by Trump and his crypto-friendly policies, could bring an end to the SEC’s case. Former CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo, who is a leading candidate to become the ""Crypto Czar"" in Trump’s administration, said that the SEC should drop its case against Ripple. DTX Exchange: A fast-growing crypto altcoin DTX Exchange (DTX) has been getting a lot of attention in the crypto market because of its amazing presale performance. So far, the price of DTX has jumped by 500%, and the presale is still in phase six, which means the price could go even higher. Recently, DTX was listed on CoinMarketCap, which has helped it reach millions of new investors. The DTX token will be the main currency used on the DTX Exchange, a new platform that combines the best features of both centralized exchanges (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX). Right now, one DTX token is worth just $0.12. However, when phase seven of the presale starts, the price is expected to rise to $0.14. And after DTX is listed on a big exchange, the price could reach $0.20. This would mean a 100% return for anyone who buys now. Because of these exciting features, many investors have jumped in to buy DTX during its presale, pushing the total funds raised above $9.1 million. With such a low entry price and big potential for growth, experts believe DTX could be one of the best new cryptocurrencies to invest in.

37172319,https://nulltx.com/?p=135112,1733231027,$500K Inflows Power Up DTX to $8.9M In 24 Hours: DOGE and Memecoins Show Bullish Comeback,"The recovering sentiment in the memecoin sector is renewing investor confidence. As memecoin projects regain bullish performance, DTX Exchange (DTX) is stealing the spotlight with its mind-blowing presale performance and million-dollar price rally. This new entrant in the deFi sector is making headlines with insane trading tools and the first-ever unified blockchain. Legendary Trader Forecasts Next Price Target For Dogecoin Dogecoin is one of the standout performers in the crypto market in the last weeks. Over the past 34 days, DOGE has rallied by 210%, climbing from $0.13 to above $0.41. The rally was fueled by excitement surrounding the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), spearheaded by Dogecoin advocate Elon Musk under the forthcoming US President Donald Trump. However, the rally has plateaued, with DOGE experiencing a sideways movement over the last 16 days. Despite this, the daily DOGE/USD chart continues to exhibit a highly bullish outlook. Legendary trader Peter Brandt, in collaboration with the observations of a crypto analyst known by the handle Kultigin83, has highlighted a “running continuation flag” on the DOGE/USD chart, forecasting a potential price target of $0.66. Source: TradingView The running continuation flag is a classic chart pattern recognized for its bullish implications. It generally appears during a strong uptrend when the price briefly consolidates or moves slightly downward within a parallel or slightly expanding channel. This pattern is crucial because it suggests that despite the temporary pause, the predominant bullish momentum is still very much intact. FLOKI Price Analysis: Bullish Signals Point to Breakout Potential Floki Inu (FLOKI), priced at $0.00022, continues to capture attention in the crypto sphere, fueled by a strong market cap of $2.19 billion. This meme coin, often regarded as the “people’s cryptocurrency,” has seen a 27.01% surge in 24-hour trading volume, reaching an impressive $408.66 million. Such robust activity highlights growing investor interest, further solidified by a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 56.047, signaling a balanced yet slightly bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the MACD at 0.00001447 suggests subtle bullish trends, hinting at potential upside price movements. Looking ahead, FLOKI’s trajectory seems promising, with analysts predicting a potential breakout if trading volume sustains these levels. The current RSI indicates room for growth before hitting overbought territory, giving traders an opportunity to ride the wave. With its expanding ecosystem and strategic marketing efforts, FLOKI could challenge meme-coin giants like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. DTX Exchange (DTX)’s Growing Popularity Hits CoinMarketCap At the core of DTX Exchange’s technical architecture are smart contracts. These self-executing contracts are deployed on the Ethereum blockchain and govern various aspects of the platform, including order execution, trade settlement, and asset management. Smart contracts ensure that trades are executed automatically and transparently without the need for intermediaries. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a crucial component of DTX Exchange’s technical infrastructure. The EVM is a runtime environment that executes smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Following the resounding success of its presale rally, DTX Exchange (DTX) is now listed on the data aggregation platform CoinMarketCap. DTX Exchange (DTX) Surpasses $9 Million in ICO Funding To uphold the principles of decentralization and security, DTX Exchange (DTX) adopts a noncustodial wallet approach. Traders maintain full control of their private keys and digital assets, storing them securely in their personal wallets. Non-custodial wallets significantly reduce the risk of funds being compromised in the event of a security breach. This approach aligns with the decentralized nature of blockchain technology and promotes individual ownership and responsibility. DTX Exchange is designed to be interoperable with external protocols and platforms. Through cross-chain integrations and partnerships, DTX Exchange aims to provide access to a broader range of assets and liquidity. Join now!

Among them, a new DeFi coin has emerged. This new crypto offers massive growth potential despite being in its presale stage and its roadmap shows it will dominate the industry in 2025. Although Pepe (PEPE) and Solana (SOL) are recording bullish momentums, the new coin has proven to be the best cryptocurrency investment in this market. Do you want an investment that will deliver huge gains in the coming year? PEPE, SOL, and the new coin could be your best bets! Pepe Shows Massive Growth in the Crypto Market, Analysts Predict Surge to New Highs Pepe recorded massive growth in November as more investors rushed to buy, targeting huge profits. PEPE gained over 130% on the monthly chart. Nonetheless, the meme coin has encountered challenges crossing the resistance that has formed at $0.0000221 and dropped in a pullback. If this resistance is broken, market experts say PEPE will explode to new highs. AlejandroBTC, a renowned analyst, stated that PEPE’s price may explode to new all-time highs in December 2024. He highlighted a crypto market chart that shorted PEPE, breaking the $0.0000320 level in this bull market. Another popular analyst, Crypto Candy, re-echoed a similar forecast. Their chart showed PEPE surpassing $0.0000301. Looking into the future, nearly all PEPE technical indicators are bullish. PEPE was valued at $0.0000212 on December 2, 2024, up 5.26% in the last week. Market experts say PEPE will rise to $0.0000248 in December. Although PEPE is bullish, investors consider the new DeFi coin the best cryptocurrency in this bull run because of its massive growth potential. Solana's DEX Network Hits Record Milestones, Analysts Predict Price Surge to $300 Solana’s DEX network thrived in November 2024 as the crypto market thrived. Notably, the ecosystem hit record-breaking milestones as monthly trading volumes surpassed $109 billion. This remarkable growth represents a 108% gain from October's $52.49 billion, as reported by DeFiLlama. On that note, Raydium dominated Solana’s DEX sector with nearly 63% of weekly volume and processed over $780 billion in November. Furthermore, the active addresses on Solana also surged to 25 million, according to Glassnode, highlighting growth in user participation. Crypto market analysts say SOL’s price will continue rising, with indicators pointing to a potential $300. SOL gained 61% between November 5 and November 22, reaching highs of $263 amid these strong network metrics and increased adoption. Despite a recent pullback, SOL is expected to resume its bullish momentum. SOL traded at $226 on December 2, 2024, down 7.36% in the past week. Analysts say SOL will rise again to $268 this month. Despite the projected growth, investors are turning to a new DeFi coin targeting the highest profits in this bull cycle. DTX Exchange: A New Crypto Project with Hybrid Blockchain and 120,000 Asset Classes The DTX Exchange (DTX) ecosystem is powered by a hybrid blockchain, VulcanX. According to the team, the hybrid blockchain has a unique design to help maintain the DTX platform’s operation. DTX Exchange caters to traders and non-traders who access several use cases. The platform has many tradable assets, including crypto, bonds, stocks, and other equity products, coupled with foreign currencies. DTX Exchange is highly appealing to users since some assets offered on the platform have up to 1000x leverage options linked, and there are over 120,000 asset classes. The potential of succeeding in online trading while using the platform and its DeFi coin will grow as more users enjoy access to improved market positions. Furthermore, the DTX Black Club, a reward program for the most active and productive traders on the DTX Exchange, is accessible to successful traders. On that note, investors and traders qualify for the club whenever they have $10,000 in their trading accounts. Users are then served takebacks with weekly and monthly bonuses, influenced by the level of activity while using the exchange. Additionally, the DTX Exchange team installed a feature for Web3 users. All simple Web3 actions on the Phoenix Wallet are supported by various tools with advanced features and functionality to be provided on the platform soon. Thus, it will dominate the crypto market in this bull run. With all the features and capabilities, the new crypto has grown into a dominant investment in the industry. DTX Exchange: The DeFi Coin Set to Deliver a 100% ROI for New Investors While Pepe (PEPE) and Solana (SOL) have delivered massive gains in the crypto market, investors have discovered a new DeFi coin, DTX Exchange (DTX), which has significant growth potential. This new crypto has many features and utilities that make it a great long-term investment. DTX is currently in Stage 6 of its public presale trading at $0.12 and it has already recorded a 500% ROI for early investors. In that context, DTX has created a large opportunity for investors looking for the best cryptocurrency investment in the market. With that growth potential, DTX joins PEPE and Solana, among the best cryptos to invest in 2025.

37172316,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=621890,1733230726,France introduces tax on unrealized Bitcoin capital gains,"France has decided to shake things up in its tax system, and this time, Bitcoin is on the chopping block. The government’s latest regulation targets so-called “unproductive wealth”—a category that includes assets like private jets, yachts, luxury cars, and now, Bitcoin. These are things that don’t directly generate income, according to French authorities. The logic? If it doesn’t contribute to the economy or create cash flow, it should be taxed harder. But analysts say this could hit Bitcoin investors hard and scare off innovation in the crypto space. How France taxes Bitcoin today France is no stranger to taxing crypto. Back in 2019, the country rolled out rules for taxing digital assets under Article 150 VH bis of the General Tax Code. If you live in France and make more than €305 in profit from selling Bitcoin or any other crypto in a year, you owe taxes. Below €305? You’re off the hook—but you still have to declare every last transaction. Here’s how it works: France uses a flat tax system for crypto profits. That means you’re hit with a combined tax rate of 30%. It breaks down to 12.8% for income tax and 17.2% for social security contributions. Sounds simple enough, right? Not so fast. In 2023, France added a progressive tax scale to the mix. Starting with the 2023 tax year (reported in 2024), people in the lowest tax brackets (those earning under €27,478) get a slight break. They’ll pay a maximum of 28.2%, compared to the usual 30%. But it’s not just about how much you pay—it’s also about what you have to report. Every crypto account you hold outside of France has to be declared. And let’s face it, most crypto exchanges aren’t exactly based in Paris. The reporting process involves completing a Cerfa 3916-bis form along with your annual tax return. Miss this step, and you’re looking at penalties of €750 per undeclared account, or €1,500 if the account’s value tops €50,000. The devil in the details Here’s where things get even trickier. Not all crypto transactions are taxable in France, a la crypto-to-crypto exchanges. This exception might sound like a loophole, but it’s really a way to encourage portfolio diversification without punishing investors every time they make a move in the market. Still, every taxable transaction has to be meticulously recorded and reported. France’s tax authorities can audit records for up to three years—or up to ten if they suspect fraud or undeclared activity. Income from staking, lending, or masternodes is taxable, and it needs to be reported. The same goes for capital gains from selling assets like NFTs or participating in liquidity pools. If you fail to declare your taxable gains, you could face penalties ranging from 10% to 80% of the undeclared amount. For intentional tax evasion, the stakes are even higher. You’re looking at fines of up to €3 million and a potential seven-year prison sentence.

The project has now raised $19.5 million of its $20.75 million goal, leaving just $1.2 million to be raised. The presale offers investors the chance to purchase tokens at the current price of $0.100 per token before the price jumps to $0.125 in the next stage, with just a few days available. When the presale ends, we expect the RXS price to surge by 25%. The demand for the token is growing, which is why this value surge is clear. In less than two days, the Rexas team has sold 277.6 million tokens, testifying to strong investor confidence and interest in the project. After the presale closes, Rexas intends to list the token on other exchanges. Analysts expect the price of the RXS token to rise considerably in the next few months. Rexas features a solid roadmap and unique DeFi services, and it has the opportunity to provide solid returns for its early investors. Rexas Aims to Revolutionize DeFi With Strong Roadmap and Services What makes Rexas different from the rest of the pack is that it provides a plethora of decentralized financial services, including staking, yield farming, and liquidity provision. The project’s vision is to create a better DeFi land with its way of doing things, which has attracted attention for its transparency and security features. As soon as the presale ends, Rexas hopes to leave its mark in the DeFi universe. Investors show extreme confidence in the project, with only a few remaining tokens. With Rexas's team already executing its plans, they have positioned themselves as a serious player in the crypto market. This is actually due to the rising demand for the project. When the price is set, early investors have the opportunity to receive a lower price compared to the next stage price increase. This doubles down on Rexas, working to increase community engagement and transparency to drive long-term growth. Shiba Inu Poised for 10x Growth in the Next 2 Months Shiba Inu (SHIB) has recently seen massive growth, gaining almost 40% percent of value over the past month. Today, the token is worth about $0.000025 per coin, and analysts expect it to hit $0.000049 in 2025. But now, SHIB represents nearly double its worth, indicating that Shiba Inu could experience exponential growth in the near term. That’s because the developers behind Shiba Inu’s Ethereum-based Layer-2 solution—dubbed Shibarium—have attracted a lot of investor excitement. Their goal is to reduce transaction fees and speed so that it can make sense within its ecosystem. Therefore, the rise in the price of SHIB will be congruent with its adoption. SHIB boasted of price growth potential, but there are challenges. Regulative scrutiny and market volatility could hold it back. SHIB’s active community and continual improvements on the way of Shibarium hint at hope for future price increases. 2. SHIB’s price will be largely dictated by how the market affects Bitcoin’s price. If the cryptocurrency market's future is bullish, the cost of Shiba Inu will potentially rocket. The coin also faces competition from new meme coins, which could dilute its momentum. Despite these problems, SHIB’s community is one of its strongest assets. SHIB has all the ingredients to outsmart expectations, playing with Shibarium's strong backing and growth. At the same time, SHIB’s investors must be aware of possible future market trends, moves, and risks. Conclusion Both Rexas and Shiba Inu present exciting opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on the growing cryptocurrency market. Rexas’s presale success and innovative approach to DeFi services suggest that its token could see substantial price increases once it launches. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu’s development of Shibarium and strong community support position it as a potentially high-growth asset.

The move comes amid growing conversations about establishing a strategic BTC reserve in the US under the incoming Trump administration. US Shifts Seized BTC The transaction involves almost 19,800 BTC seized in 2021 during an investigation into James Zhong’s Silk Road-related activities. Zhong is convicted of wire fraud after authorities discovered hidden BTC. The Department of Justice had previously seized over 50,000 BTC from Zhong, with the government retaining almost $18 billion worth of BTC. While the reason for the transfer is unknown, speculations are rife that the government could sell off the BTC or repurpose the stolen funds. “JUST IN: US Government moves $1.92 billion worth of #Bitcoin to a new address.” The transferred funds were sent to two wallets, each containing $969 million and $949 million in BTC respectively. The government still holds over $18 billion worth of BTC. The transfer of BTC comes with many expecting President-elect Donald Trump to make significant headway on a Bitcoin reserve bill early in his second term. However, Coinbase Prime has partnered with the US government to manage crypto assets linked to seizures and part of the broader enforcement landscape. Meanwhile, calls to pardon Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht have intensified, with Trump facing renewed pressure to act on his campaign promises. Trump’s Crypto Plans The decision could significantly impact Donald Trump’s plans to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Trump promised he would not sell any of the country’s BTC holdings. US Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced the BITCOIN Act to establish a strategic reserve this year. The US is not the only country planning to establish a strategic reserve. Poland has seen a presidential candidate make a similar promise to create a reserve. Brazil is also looking to create a sovereign BTC reserve. BTC’s Stunning Month BTC stunned market watchers during November, registering an increase of almost 40% as it surged towards $100,000. However, its rally has stalled just short of the $100,000 mark, with the price falling from an all-time high of $99,655 on November 23. BTC’s latest rally has been driven by several factors like Donald Trump’s election victory, growing prospects of a clear regulatory framework, and a crypto-friendly administration. Trump has also promised to keep the SEC in check and will likely appoint a crypto-friendly SEC Chair after Gary Gensler steps down.

Notably, Justin Son’s Tron has joined the trend as the token has surpassed a record $20 billion in market cap. The Tron price also hit $0.23 as it recorded a surge of over 13% in the last 24 hours. Impressively, TRX is up 42% on the monthly chart and over 101% year-to-date (YTD). TRX Achieves New Highs TRX’s all-time high comes just after the founder Justin Sun disclosed that he has invested a massive $30 million in Donald Trump’s crypto project on November 25. With this, he has become the largest investor in the World Liberty Financial (WLFI) tokens. Smaller Tokens To Rally Next? Analysts predict that tokens like TRX setting new all-time highs could set the stage for smaller tokens to rally in December. Notably, many analysts expect an altcoin season leading into early 2025, which could see Ethereum rise to $4,000 before President Trump officially takes office. Meanwhile, Bitcoin dominance fell below its two-year support line on Nov. 30 in another signal of the potential commencement of the altcoin season leading into 2025. The dropping Bitcoin dominance indicates that investors are taking profit from their BTC positions and investing part of them into altcoins. December’s altcoin rally has already begun based on historical patterns emerging on the declining ratio of altcoins relative to Bitcoin’s market capitalization. Popular trader Mikybull also took to X to share that the altcoin season has begun. Notably, altcoins also benefit from factors beyond technical chart patterns. Tron token, worldwide Google searches for the coin rose to an over three-month high of 39, last seen in September. The growing interest in the token could also be linked to Justin Sun, who announced on Nov. 21 that he bought a $6.2 million art piece consisting of a banana taped to a wall at a New York auction. XRP, HBAR Rally XRP has also continued to show an impressive surge and is currently trading at $2.73, up over 16% in the last 24 hours. The token has surged over a remarkable 100% in the last week. The Hedera (HBAR) token was November’s best performer among the 100 largest cryptocurrencies after rallying over a massive 763% during the past month. It saw an increase in retail interest after a Nov. 12 filing revealed that Canary Capital is seeking to launch a Hedera-based ETP. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Microsoft Bitcoin Proposal: Could Saylor’s Bold Strategy Boost Shareholder Value by $5 Trillion? , Bitcoin To Crash? A prominent on chain analyst, Ali Martinez, remarked that many analysts are expecting a potential Bitcoin price crash. However, he highlighted that as Bitcoin tends to do the opposite of what the crowd believes, there is potential for BTC to go higher. If the current cycle behaves like the last two, BTC could go to $120,000-$150,000 before the first 30% price correction. However, he has set his eyes set on two key support levels at $93,580 and the second one at $90,520, which may invalidate his bullish thesis and lead to the bearish scenario that some analysts predict. If both the levels are lost, he revealed that he will prepare his trading account for a major price correction to take advantage of such a unique buying opportunity.",POSITIVE,BTC | TRX,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | TRX,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/trx-breaks-record-20b-in-market-cap-as-the-altcoins-season-kickstarts/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Ripple (XRP) has been one of the standout performers over the past few sessions, flipping Tether (USDT) and Solana (SOL) to become the third largest cryptocurrency in the market. XRP is up an incredible 89% over the past seven days and continues to push higher. Other top performers include Hedera (HBAR), up 140% over the past week, and Ondo Finance (ONDO), up 55% over the past week. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) endured a substantial blip as it slipped below $3,600 to a low of $3,566 before recovering and climbing back to its current level of $3,655. ETH is currently down just over 1% over the past 24 hours. The crypto market cap continued to grow and is up by 1.06% to move to $3.48 trillion. State Of The Market The crypto market remained bullish as Bitcoin (BTC) continued its consolidation phase, oscillating between $94,000 and $98,000. However, Ripple (XRP) is the top performer in the market, with the price up almost 12% over the past 24 hours. Hedera (HBAR) and Ondo Finance (ONDO) also emerged as standout performers, registering substantial gains over the past week. Trading volume surged to $284 billion, an increase of 65%, indicating heightened investor activity. BTC registered a marginal dip over the past 24 hours and spot Bitcoin ETFs registered inflows worth $15 million. While data from BlackRock is unavailable, Fidelity recorded inflows of $25 million. However, Grayscale registered significant outflows totaling $28 million. UK Pushes Ahead With Crypto Regulation The United Kingdom pressed ahead with crypto regulation to counter the US and EU, bring much-needed clarity, and encourage innovation in the field. The move comes amid a growing rivalry with the US, where strategies and a commitment to creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve are attracting crypto companies. The UK’s latest move is led by the Treasury, focusing on staking services and stablecoins. Stablecoins are set to play a significant role in the UK’s regulatory framework, with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) set to collaborate with major industry players to establish guidelines. Staking services are also being redefined to avoid stringent regulations tied to collective investment schemes. By easing limitations the UK government hopes to facilitate a more conducive landscape for enterprises considering staking as a service. The need for clear regulations is highlighted by swift changes in the global crypto landscape and competitive risks from other crypto hubs. Crypto Exchange Volumes Hit Three-Year High Monthly crypto exchange volumes hit a three-year high in November, driven by Donald Trump’s victory in the US elections. According to data from New Hedge, spot crypto exchange volumes hit $2.9 trillion in November, the highest since May 2021. According to a spokesperson from Crypto.com, November was the strongest month, with record high volume on the platform. “As a company and as an industry, we’re seeing increasing interest and investment in cryptocurrencies, leading to record trading volumes globally over the last few weeks. “We anticipate positive market sentiment will continue into the first quarter of next year.” The spokesperson confirmed the increase in volumes was sparked by the recent political developments in the US, with industry leaders suggesting the incoming administration will be the most pro-crypto in history and create a favorable regulatory framework. “Outside the US, there is more certainty to the industry and those wanting to invest in crypto, thanks partly to jurisdictions either introducing or committing to regulatory frameworks for digital assets. This has been an important factor in driving global adoption and increasing trading volumes.” Kraken also confirmed it experienced a solid month regarding trading volume, with perpetual volumes up significantly. “Kraken has experienced a surge in our perpetual contract volumes as a variety of traders have sought leveraged exposure or to hedge risk throughout the post-election market upturn. While much of this activity has been concentrated in Bitcoin futures, interest in both our Dogecoin and Solana perpetuals has reached new highs, with 24-hour volume for DOGE exceeding that of Ether for the first time.” Spot Bitcoin ETFs Stellar Month A Binance spokesperson also confirmed the platform witnessed more participants entering the crypto ecosystem. This could be due to several factors, including spot Bitcoin ETFs in major markets. Spot Bitcoin ETFs registered combined inflows worth $6.87 billion, while outflows hit $411 million. The crypto market cap has continued to climb and currently sits at $3.5 trillion. “The introduction of Bitcoin ETF options has made it easier for institutional investors to gain exposure and hedge risks, contributing significantly to the recent rally. With substantial inflows into these ETFs, Bitcoin is poised for further integration into mainstream financial markets.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is consolidating between $94,000 and $98,000 as it continues to trade in range. Currently trading just below $95,500, BTC has registered a marginal decline of 0.82% over the past 24 hours as it struggles to build momentum and push towards $100,000. BTC has remained subdued since hitting its all-time high on November 23, peaking at $99,655. Despite the muted price action, spot Bitcoin ETFs have continued to record inflows, except Grayscale, which registered outflows worth $28 million. BTC’s reliability as a reserve asset was further boosted by the news of MicroStrategy expanding its BTC holdings. The firm added 15,400 BTC to its holdings, according to a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The acquisition, completed between November 25 and December 1, saw the company invest $1.5 billion for an average purchase price of $95,976 per BTC. The acquisition aligns with the company’s aggressive strategy of maximizing its BTC reserves. The latest purchase brings MicroStrategy’s BTC reserves to a staggering 401,100 BTC, valued at over $38 billion at current market prices. Now, let’s look at the price chart. BTC started the previous week in the red, registering a substantial drop on Monday and settling at $92,846. Buyers attempted a recovery on Tuesday but were thwarted as BTC sellers took control and drove the price down by 1% to $91,913. BTC also hit a low of $90,708 during the session. BTC recovered on Wednesday as it registered an increase of 4.32% to go back above $95,000 and settle at $95,883. Thursday saw BTC register a marginal decline as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. However, it was back in positive territory on Friday, registering an increase of 1.76% and settling at $97,374. Source: TradingView The weekend began with a drop of 1.14% on Saturday as BTC fell to $96,263. However, it was back above $97,000 on Sunday after an increase of 0.79% pushed it to $97,026. The current week began with BTC back in the red, dropping 1.25% and settling at $95,812. The current session sees the price marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. With BTC in a consolidation phase, analysts expect it to remain above $95,000. However, it needs a catalyst to build momentum and drive it beyond $100,000. Despite subdued price action, market watchers remain confident of a move past $100,000 before the end of the year. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) remains firmly in the red as sellers look to drive the price below $3,500. ETH has declined by 1.40% over the past 24 hours as it struggles to build momentum and go above $3,700. ETH began last week experiencing significant volatility as it dropped after reaching an intraday high of $3,547, ultimately settling at $3,415. The price fell back on Tuesday, dropping by almost 3% and settling at $3,325. Despite facing considerable selling pressure on Tuesday, ETH rallied on Wednesday, rising nearly 10% to surge past $3,500 and settle at $3,657. However, it was back in the red on Thursday, dropping over 2% and settling at $3,580, as buyers kept the price above $3,500. The price recovered marginally on Friday, registering an increase of 0.39% and settling at $3,594. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment intensified over the weekend as ETH registered an increase of over 3% on Saturday to go above $3,700 and settle at $3,705. The price experienced volatility on Sunday but managed a marginal increase to $3,710. However, ETH fell back in the red on Monday after facing significant volatility as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. As a result, ETH rose to an intraday high of $3,763 and fell to an intraday low of $3,559 before settling at $3,645 after registering a decline of almost 2%. The current session sees ETH remain in the red, with the price down by 0.56% at $3,625. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) is attempting a recovery after bouncing off the support at $220, as it looks to reverse its recent bearish trend. SOL has been trading downwards after failing to stay above $260 and registered a substantial drop of over 7% last Monday to slip below $250 and settle at $234. SOL faced significant volatility on Tuesday as buyers attempted a recovery and sellers tried to drive the price below the 20-day SMA. SOL briefly dipped below the 20-day SMA as it fell to a low of $222 before settling at $230 after a drop of 1.49%. The price recovered on Wednesday as it bounced off the 20-day SMA to register an increase of almost 5% and settle at $242. SOL was back in the red on Thursday, dropping by nearly 2% after experiencing considerable volatility. However, buyers returned to the market on Friday, pushing SOL up by 2.41% to $242. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment took over during the weekend as SOL dropped by 2.33% on Saturday and then registered a marginal decline on Sunday to settle at $237. Selling pressure registered a substantial increase on Monday as SOL slipped below the 20-day SMA after a drop of almost 5% and settled at $225. The current session sees SOL marginally up as buyers and sellers struggle to take control. Buyers will look to build momentum and push SOL back above the 20-day SMA. On the other hand, sellers will look to take control and drive SOL below $220. A break below this level could see SOL drop to $200. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis Ripple (XRP) is up an astonishing 93% over the past week and almost 20% in the past 24 hours as its stunning rally continues. Data from Santiment has revealed a surge in active wallets, which raced past 116,000. XRP’s trading volume has also registered a jump of 92% thanks to increasing investor interest and retail investor participation. While the numbers are impressive, declining whale activity has limited the rally’s momentum as large investors remain cautious. The on-chain profit-to-loss metric shows that large traders are unwilling to take risks and aggressive positions during the ongoing rally. Source: TradingView The price chart shows XRP’s incredible rally beginning in the middle of last week as it recovered after hitting a low of $1.28 on Tuesday. XRP shrugged off the bearish sentiment on Wednesday, rising over 5% to $1.47. Buyers retained control on Thursday as XRP pushed above $1.50 and settled at $1.54. Bullish sentiment intensified significantly on Friday as XRP rallied almost 17% to surge to $1.80. XRP remained bullish over the weekend as it registered an increase of 8.29% on Saturday to settle at $1.95. Sellers attempted to drive XRP lower but were unsuccessful as the price rallied, surging almost 18% to go above $2 and settle at $2.29. XRP remained bullish on Monday as buyers set their sights on $3. As a result, XRP surged almost 19% to reach an intraday high of $2.87 before settling at $2.72. The current session sees XRP down just over 2% as sellers look to drive the price lower. However, if buyers can retake control, XRP could go past $3. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Analysis Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to face considerable volatility as it oscillates between $0.40 and $0.45. After starting the previous week on a negative note, DOGE dipped to an intraday low of $0.365 on Tuesday. However, it recovered on Wednesday, rising by 3.59% and settling at $0.401. Buyers attempted to drive DOGE higher on Thursday but were unsuccessful, losing momentum after reaching an intraday high of $0.429. As a result, the price fell back and settled at $0.401. Bullish sentiment intensified on Friday as DOGE rose by 6.27% and settled at $0.427. Source: TradingView Despite a strong showing on Friday, DOGE fell by 1.31% on Saturday as sellers overwhelmed buyers.

New Viral Altcoin Sees Major Whale Activity As It Nears $1M In Presales,"Ethereum may not have spiked like its top rival Solana, or set a new all-time high like Ethereum. However, the largest altcoin has been steadily gaining in November, and last week, it hit a five-month high. It’s now gearing for a year-end rally that could propel it past $4,000. Meanwhile, investors are turning to new DeFi altcoin sensation Yeti Ouro (YETIO), which is closing in on the $1 million mark in its ongoing presale. Ethereum News: ETH Price To $4,000? Ethereum has traded above $3,600 since the weekend began, and despite a slight dip at the start of the week, the altcoin has rebounded to change hands past this critical level. It has now traded consistently above $3,500 for seven days. For ETH, the next critical price resistance that it must clear to finish the year on a high is $3,659, which has been a long-term resistance. In the past week, it has climbed past this level in moments but has been unable to maintain its price above this level. If it fails to consistently trade above this level, it could dip, and the next support level is at $3,360. Its next support levels are at $3.051 and $2,816. However, if it manages to surge past this critical resistance, the Ethereum price could hit $4,000 by the end of the year. One of the biggest tailwinds for altcoin has been its rising interest from institutional investors. For months, this group has preferred Bitcoin over ETH, but as data from Farside shows, Ethereum spot ETFs have been doing exceptionally well. On Friday last week, they brought in $332 million, with BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust attracting $250 million, which was higher than the $137 million that the company’s Bitcoin ETF attracted. Analysts from Bernstein say that this continued investment “creates favorable demand-supply dynamics for ETH.” It could get even better if the Trump administration approves Ether staking for ETFs, which would make them a more attractive venture than their BTC counterparts. Crypto Whales Turn To Yeti Ouro As crypto whales monitor the Ethereum price movement, they are investing in Yeti Ouro, a new utility meme coin that is taking the sector by storm. Yeti Ouro is built around Yeti Go, a new play-to-earn game that allows players to compete for cash prizes paid out in YETIO, the ecosystem’s native token. The goal for the players is to outwit and attack each other using weapons purchased through YETIO. They must also dodge hazards and obstacles along the way to emerge victorious. YETIO is built with utility in mind. In addition to rewards and purchasing weapons, the token pays for the race entry fees, powers transactions on the in-game marketplace and can be staked to unlock exclusive rewards and special content. Its supply is capped at one billion tokens, with 5% allocated to the token-burning mechanism, boosting its price. In the ongoing presale, the project has sold over 71 million tokens and is edging closer to the $1 million mark in funds raised. At $0.012, the token is going for a steeply discounted price, with many expecting it to skyrocket as it proceeds to the second stage of the presale.

Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis: ETH Trades At $3664 Ethereum (ETH) registered a marginal decline over the past 24 hours as it struggles to go above $3,700. Despite recent struggles, ETH is up almost 50% over the past month following Donald Trump’s election victory. Ethereum (ETH) faced considerable volatility last weekend as buyers and sellers struggled to exert influence. Thanks to the volatility, Ethereum (ETH) ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping just over 1% and settling at $3,362. Buyers returned to the market on Monday as Ethereum (ETH) rose to an intraday high of $3,547. However, buyers could not stay above $3,500, and the price fell to settle at $3,415, an increase of 1.60%. Despite the strong start to the week, ETH fell back on Tuesday, dropping almost 3% to settle at $3,325. The Ethereum (ETH) network posted a significant increase of almost 10% on Wednesday, surging past $3,500 and settling at $3,657. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching this level, and ETH registered a drop of just over 2% and settled at $3,580. Friday saw buyers and sellers struggle to exert influence, and ETH ultimately settled at $3,594 after a marginal increase. The ETH token was bullish over the weekend, rising by 3.08% on Saturday to go above $3,700 and settle at $3,708.

The latest Dogecoin (DOGE) outlook illustrates the coin’s rise by over 10% this week, rekindling enthusiasm for the iconic coin. Elon Musk’s recent X post, featuring a meme about the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), has fueled further excitement, leading to speculation on his impact on Dogecoin’s price. Despite this resurgence, analysts suggest that Dogecoin’s (DOGE) era of substantial returns might be over, with its current activities showing smaller increases compared to previous surges. Nonetheless, the recent uptick showcases Dogecoin’s (DOGE) ability to attract attention, especially during a market adjustment. Currently, the meme coin is slumping on the daily charts, registering an intraday decline of 0.92%.

37172122,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373256,1733230315,Ethereum Price Analysis: ETH Gains 9% Weekly But The Road to $4K Has These Obstacles,"Ethereum is showing strong bullish momentum, driven by an influx of buyers. However, as the price nears a significant resistance level at $4K, market participants should anticipate a period of consolidation with the potential for heightened volatility. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Weekly Chart Ethereum has experienced an impulsive uptrend, fueled by buying activity near the $2.5K support region. This movement has led to a breakout above the key 100-day and 200-day moving averages, signaling a shift in market sentiment and confirming the buyers’ dominance. The asset is approaching the $4K resistance zone, a crucial psychological and technical level, likely filled with substantial supply. The $4K threshold is a probable distribution zone for long-term holders looking to take profits. A consolidation phase around this level will likely give the market time to absorb selling pressure. However, a liquidity pool above $4K could trigger a short squeeze if breached, potentially driving Ethereum toward its all-time high of $4.9K. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, ETHs price action reflects a Wyckoff accumulation pattern within the $2K-$2.8K range, culminating in a breakout and an impulsive rally past the $3.5K decisive threshold. The asset has also broken above the upper boundary of a bearish wedge pattern, a bullish signal, and has since completed a pullback. If this correction holds and buying pressure continues, Ethereum will likely extend its uptrend toward the $4K resistance. However, caution is warranted, as a bearish divergence between the RSI indicator and the price suggests a waning bullish momentum. This divergence indicates that the market may face a period of consolidation before determining its next significant move. Onchain Analysis By Shayan The behavior observed in Ethereum’s price movement, particularly the failure to drop below the $3.3K level, aligns with significant liquidity below that point, as seen in the Binance liquidation heatmap. This liquidity likely consists of stop-loss orders and liquidation prices for large traders, or whales, who actively defend their positions to prevent a cascade of liquidations. Similarly, the $4K level is another critical juncture with substantial liquidity, likely tied to short positions established in anticipation of resistance.

37173035,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51259,1733229979,Ripple CEO Sends Message to XRP Family As Bulls Target $3,"XRP, the cryptocurrency at the center of Ripple’s operations, recently reached a significant milestone, hitting $2.79, according to data from Coinmarketcap. This represents the highest value XRP has seen in several years, placing the token just 20% below its price all-time high set nearly seven years ago. XRP whale activity has also surged as data from CryptoQuant revealed a new all-time high for large transactions. This heightened activity has sparked interest in XRP, cementing its position as one of the most active tokens in the cryptocurrency market by trading volume. Ripple CEO and Legal Team Comment on Market Trends Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse responded to the recent rally with a brief but enthusiastic message to the XRP community on X. gm XRP family — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 2, 2024 Earlier, Garlinghouse had expressed optimism about the regulatory landscape, stating that the departure of SEC Chair Gary Gensler could improve conditions for the cryptocurrency industry, saying it would make “all the boats rise.” Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s chief legal officer, also voiced his opinion on the regulatory impact, stating that the SEC’s actions had “artificially suppressed” cryptocurrency prices. Ripple’s victory in its legal battle with the SEC has drawn commentary from notable figures in the crypto space. Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko referred to Ripple’s win as “the fatal wound” in what he described as the SEC’s “lawfare” approach against cryptocurrencies. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community and Market Sentiment XRP’s recent surge has reignited enthusiasm within its community. Members of the popular Reddit forum r/Ripple have speculated on the possibility of the token reaching $100. While such discussions reflect heightened optimism, they also resemble patterns observed during previous market peaks, including the 2017 bull run. Historical trends offer context for this renewed excitement. During the early 2018 market surge, Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen was briefly listed among the world’s wealthiest individuals following XRP’s meteoric rise above $3. However, the subsequent bear market led to significant losses for the cryptocurrency, highlighting the risks inherent in such exuberance. XRP’s Resilience Amid Regulatory Challenges XRP has consistently ranked among the top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. However, its price sharply declined after the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020. At one point, XRP was on the verge of exiting the top 10 cryptocurrencies. Despite regulatory challenges, the token maintained the 7th position. Its recent recovery and surge toward record highs underscore the resilience and determination of its teeming community of members. As XRP approaches its historic peak, it remains a focal point in discussions about regulatory reform and market potential.

37171969,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=106534,1733229764,Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Hits All-Time High of 103.92T Amid Rising Hash Rate,"Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Reaches New Record at 103.92 Trillion Bitcoin’s mining difficulty—a measure of how challenging it is to mine a new block—has reached an all-time high of 103.92 trillion (T) following a 1.59% adjustment at block height 872,928 , according to CloverPool data. This increase marks a significant milestone for the Bitcoin network, underscoring its growing computational power and security. Accompanying this rise, the network’s average computing power , or hash rate, now stands at an impressive 726.57 exahashes per second (EH/s) , reflecting the escalating competition among miners to secure block rewards. Understanding Bitcoin Mining Difficulty 1. What Is Mining Difficulty? Bitcoin’s mining difficulty adjusts approximately every 2,016 blocks, or roughly every two weeks, to maintain a consistent block time of 10 minutes. The metric reflects the level of computational effort required to mine a block, directly correlating with the network’s hash rate. 2. Why Does It Increase? The mining difficulty rises when: Hash Rate Surges: An influx of computational power increases competition among miners. Network Security Strengthens: A higher difficulty makes the network more secure by reducing vulnerabilities to attacks. Current Mining Difficulty Milestone: Key Figures Record Difficulty: 103.92T, a 1.59% increase from the previous adjustment. Hash Rate: 726.57 EH/s, representing the network’s average computational power. These figures highlight the robustness and growing decentralization of the Bitcoin network, as more miners join the ecosystem to compete for rewards. Factors Driving the Difficulty Surge 1. Increased Mining Activity Global Expansion: Miners worldwide have ramped up operations, spurred by the recovering cryptocurrency market. New Hardware Adoption: Advances in mining technology, including energy-efficient ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits), have boosted overall network hash power. 2. Rising Bitcoin Prices Profitability for Miners: Bitcoin’s sustained price rally makes mining more lucrative, incentivizing more participants to enter the space. Post-Halving Impact: Following Bitcoin’s 2024 halving, competition for reduced block rewards (3.125 BTC) has intensified, driving up difficulty. 3. Institutional Investments in Mining Large-Scale Operations: Institutional players have invested heavily in mining farms, particularly in regions with affordable electricity. Sustainable Energy Trends: A shift toward renewable energy sources has made mining operations more scalable and socially acceptable. Implications for Bitcoin Miners 1. Increased Competition Miners face heightened competition, with only the most efficient operations likely to remain profitable. Those using outdated or less efficient equipment may struggle to cover operational costs. 2.

Miners in regions with high electricity costs may find profitability challenging. 3. Network Stability and Security The increased difficulty strengthens Bitcoin’s blockchain by making it more resistant to attacks, enhancing its long-term stability. Impact on the Broader Cryptocurrency Market 1. Bitcoin Price Correlation While mining difficulty does not directly influence Bitcoin’s price, it often reflects broader market confidence. Positive Sentiment: A record difficulty suggests strong participation and belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value. Potential Price Effects: Sustained mining activity may contribute to scarcity and, in turn, upward price momentum. 2. Decentralization The growth in hash rate and difficulty reflects the network’s increasing decentralization, reducing reliance on a few dominant miners. 3. Influence on Altcoins As Bitcoin mining becomes more competitive, smaller miners may pivot to altcoins, potentially boosting activity and value in alternative networks. Technological Advances Supporting Mining Growth 1. Energy-Efficient Hardware The adoption of next-generation ASIC miners has significantly increased hash rates while reducing energy consumption. 2. Renewable Energy Integration Miners are leveraging solar, wind, and hydroelectric power to offset costs and improve sustainability. 3. Mining Pool Collaboration Collaborative mining pools allow smaller miners to participate effectively, contributing to overall network growth. Historical Context: Difficulty Milestones 1. Early Days of Bitcoin In 2009, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty was set at 1 , a stark contrast to today’s record 103.92T. Mining could be performed on standard CPUs, highlighting how far the network has come. 2. Major Difficulty Surges 2017 Bull Run: Difficulty rose significantly during Bitcoin’s first mainstream bull market. 2021 Peak: Another major increase accompanied Bitcoin’s rise to $69,000. 2024 Recovery: The current milestone reflects renewed growth and activity post-halving. What’s Next for Bitcoin Mining? 1. Continued Hash Rate Growth As more miners join the network, the hash rate is expected to rise further, driving subsequent difficulty adjustments. 2. Geographic Shifts in Mining Regions with low-cost, renewable energy (e.g., Texas, Scandinavia) will likely attract more mining operations. 3. Long-Term Security Increased difficulty enhances Bitcoin’s resistance to attacks, cementing its reputation as the most secure blockchain. Investor and Miner Strategies 1. Miners: Adopt Efficient Hardware: Invest in state-of-the-art mining rigs to stay competitive. Optimize Energy Costs: Explore renewable energy options to reduce expenses. Join Mining Pools: Participate in pools to share rewards and mitigate risks. 2. Investors: Monitor Difficulty Trends: Use mining difficulty as an indicator of network health and activity. Assess Mining Stocks: Companies involved in Bitcoin mining may offer indirect exposure to its growth. Diversify Portfolio: Consider altcoins benefiting from shifts in mining activity. Conclusion: A Milestone for Bitcoin’s Resilience The record-high Bitcoin mining difficulty of 103.92T underscores the network’s robustness, security, and growing global participation. While the milestone reflects increased competition and operational costs for miners, it also signals confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, the rising difficulty serves as a testament to Bitcoin’s enduring strength as the world’s leading decentralized blockchain. For miners and investors, adapting to these changes will be key to navigating the ever-competitive Bitcoin ecosystem.

Here's What It Means for Traders?,"Volatility in Nasdaq-listed shares in bitcoin-holder MicroStrategy is now tracked at 2.5 times that of bitcoin. The milestone may spook most market participants but means increased income potential for savvy investors engaging in options trading.  MicroStrategy is the world's largest publicly listed bitcoin holder, boasting a coin stash of over 380,000 BTC. Investors looking to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to directly hold it have poured money into the stock this year, catalyzing a 500% rise in the share price. BTC, meanwhile, has surged by 124% this year, according to data sources CoinDesk and TradingView.  MSTR's outperformance goes beyond price. As of Monday, MSTR's 30-day options-based implied volatility, which represents expectations for price turbulence over four weeks, stood at an annualized 140.86%, according to OptionCharts.com. That's 2.5 times greater than bitcoin's 30-day implied volatility of 55.65%. BTC's IV is sourced from Deribit's DVOL index. Deribit is the world's leading crypto options exchange.   High IV means more income  Implied volatility positively impacts prices (premiums) for options or derivatives that give the purchasers the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a pre-determined price at a later date. A call gives the right to buy and put option, the right to sell.  When the IV rises, options premiums increase, allowing traders to collect more premiums by writing or selling call/put contracts.  Savvy traders holding the underlying asset capitalize on this dynamic by writing call options at strike prices significantly above the asset's current market rate. By selling these out-of-the-money calls or insurance against price rallies, they collect a premium, which represents an extra yield on top of their spot market holdings.  If the market surges, the gains from their spot holdings more than compensate for any losses incurred from being short the call. This so-called covered call strategy is popular in both the equity and BTC options markets.  MSTR's relatively higher volatility means a covered call strategy with MSTR options could generate returns 2.5 times greater than those from BTC options. Social is already buzzing with talk of traders ""monetizing the MSTR volatility.""  Readers, however, should note that the covered call strategy has risks. While it can provide additional income, it also caps potential upsides, meaning you could miss out on significant rallies and be better off just holding the coin stash.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/03/micro-strategys-wild-volatility-outpaces-bitcoin-by-2-5-times-heres-what-it-mean-for-traders,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0fdf7fd5e77baf9eb80e83ba157fa89e249c020e-1280x873.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

37171968,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=106508,1733229672,U.S. Government Deposits $962.9 Million Worth of Bitcoin Into Coinbase,"U.S. Government Moves 10,000 BTC to Coinbase In a significant move, the U.S. government deposited 10,000 BTC , valued at approximately $962.9 million , into the Coinbase Exchange . This transfer, reported by blockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain , is part of a broader trend of government-managed Bitcoin movements in 2024. Earlier in the day, a total of 19,800 BTC ($1.92 billion) was transferred from government-controlled wallets, with the Coinbase deposit comprising a substantial portion. So far this year, the U.S. government has moved a total of 25,999 BTC ($2.49 billion) to Coinbase, seemingly for custody rather than sale purposes. As of now, the U.S. government retains 183,850 BTC , valued at approximately $17.67 billion , across various wallet addresses, reinforcing its position as one of the largest Bitcoin holders globally. Understanding the U.S. Government’s Bitcoin Holdings 1. Origins of Bitcoin Seizures The government’s Bitcoin reserves largely originate from criminal seizures, including: Silk Road Seizure (2013): A large amount of Bitcoin was confiscated following the takedown of the Silk Road dark web marketplace. Various Cases: Subsequent enforcement actions against fraud, money laundering, and cybercrimes added to the government’s holdings. 2. Custodial vs. Sale Activity The recent transfer to Coinbase appears to be for custodial purposes , as there are no indications of liquidation. This aligns with the government’s practice of securely storing assets before deciding on their eventual use or sale. Key Implications of the Coinbase Deposit 1. Increased Scrutiny on Bitcoin Movements Large-scale Bitcoin transfers by the U.S. government often attract market attention, sparking speculation about: Impending Sales: Historically, government auctions of Bitcoin have influenced short-term market prices. Custody Trends: The choice of Coinbase for storage highlights the platform’s reputation for secure and regulatory-compliant services. 2. Market Reaction The deposit of 10,000 BTC into Coinbase, representing a significant amount of liquidity, could have the following effects: Price Stability: A lack of immediate sale intentions may ease fears of downward price pressure. Market Confidence: Transparency about the purpose of these transfers can reassure investors. 3. Long-Term Bitcoin Management Strategy The government’s decision to hold 183,850 BTC suggests a cautious approach toward utilizing its Bitcoin reserves. Potential future strategies include: Public Auctions: Following past precedents, the government could auction some of its holdings to the highest bidders. Strategic Retention: Retaining Bitcoin as an appreciating asset or for use in innovative financial strategies. How Does This Compare to Previous Government Bitcoin Actions? 1. Historical Auctions The U.S. government has previously auctioned Bitcoin through agencies like the U.S. Marshals Service . Notable examples include: 2014 Auction: 30,000 BTC from the Silk Road seizure was sold to venture capitalist Tim Draper. 2021 Auction: Smaller tranches of confiscated Bitcoin were auctioned, generating significant revenue. 2. Shift Toward Custodial Practices In 2024, the government appears more focused on secure custody rather than immediate liquidation. This reflects: Increased Market Sophistication: Recognition of Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value. Regulatory Considerations: Aligning with a long-term strategy amid evolving cryptocurrency regulations. Why Use Coinbase for Custody? 1. Trusted Reputation Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the U.S., offers: Institutional-Grade Security: Advanced custody solutions for high-value assets. Regulatory Compliance: Alignment with U.S. laws, ensuring transparency and reliability. 2. Accessibility and Scalability The government’s choice of Coinbase reflects the platform’s ability to handle large-scale Bitcoin deposits with ease. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? 1. Enhanced Transparency The disclosure of large Bitcoin transfers and their intended purpose fosters transparency, which is crucial for market stability. 2. Market Sentiment The deposit of 10,000 BTC into Coinbase without indications of immediate sale helps maintain positive sentiment among investors. 3. Institutional Validation The government’s use of a regulated platform like Coinbase underscores the importance of trusted custodial solutions in managing significant cryptocurrency assets. Future Considerations for Government Bitcoin Reserves 1. Potential Auctions If the government decides to liquidate portions of its holdings, it could do so through public auctions. This would: Generate Revenue: For federal programs or debt reduction. Reduce Market Impact: Auctions spread over time minimize price disruptions. 2. Legislative Influence Future government actions regarding Bitcoin may be influenced by evolving cryptocurrency policies and regulatory frameworks. 3. Holding as a Strategic Asset Retaining Bitcoin as a long-term asset could align with broader strategies to incorporate digital currencies into the financial system. Conclusion: A Strategic Move with Broader Implications The U.S. government’s deposit of 10,000 BTC into Coinbase, valued at $962.9 million , highlights its strategic approach to managing cryptocurrency assets. While the move appears custodial in nature, it signals the government’s reliance on regulated platforms for secure storage and aligns with a trend of transparency in handling digital assets. As the government retains 183,850 BTC , the implications of its actions will continue to influence the broader cryptocurrency market.

37171967,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=106506,1733229615,U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Witness $353.1 Million in Net Inflows on December 2,"Bitcoin ETFs Continue to See Strong Investor Demand On December 2, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a combined net inflow of $353.1 million , marking the third consecutive day of significant inflows, according to Farside Investors and a post by Tree News on X (formerly Twitter). This surge highlights the growing demand for Bitcoin ETFs as both retail and institutional investors continue to allocate capital into these regulated investment vehicles. The inflow was led by BlackRock’s IBIT , which accounted for a staggering $337.8 million —the lion’s share of the total. Other notable contributors included Fidelity’s FBTC with $25.1 million, ARK Invest’s ARKB with $17.2 million, Grayscale’s BTC with $6.4 million, and Franklin’s EZBC with $5.6 million. However, not all ETFs experienced gains. Grayscale’s GBTC and VanEck’s HODL reported net outflows of $28.1 million and $10.9 million , respectively, indicating a possible shift in investor preferences. Breakdown of Bitcoin ETF Activity on December 2 Top Performing ETFs by Net Inflows BlackRock IBIT: $337.8 million Fidelity FBTC: $25.1 million ARK Invest ARKB: $17.2 million Grayscale BTC: $6.4 million Franklin EZBC: $5.6 million ETFs Experiencing Net Outflows Grayscale GBTC: -$28.1 million VanEck HODL: -$10.9 million Other funds reported no significant changes, reflecting a clear preference among investors for newer, more competitive offerings. Why Are Bitcoin ETFs Attracting Capital? 1. Institutional Interest and Market Confidence Institutional adoption of Bitcoin continues to grow, and spot ETFs have become an attractive gateway for accessing the cryptocurrency market. These ETFs provide a regulated investment avenue, addressing concerns over the complexities of directly purchasing and storing Bitcoin. BlackRock’s dominance, with its $337.8 million inflow, underscores the trust institutions place in the firm’s offerings. Fidelity and ARK Invest also continue to attract significant inflows, showcasing their strong appeal among both retail and institutional investors. 2. Simplicity and Security for Investors Spot Bitcoin ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the need to manage private keys or wallets. This simplicity, combined with the regulatory oversight these ETFs provide, has fueled growing interest, particularly among risk-averse investors. 3. Broader Market Optimism The recent stability in Bitcoin’s price and its growing adoption by mainstream financial institutions have bolstered investor sentiment. The cryptocurrency’s perceived value as a hedge against inflation and a store of value continues to attract long-term holders. Challenges Facing Bitcoin ETFs While inflows into Bitcoin ETFs are strong, the market is not without its challenges. 1. Legacy Funds Losing Ground The sharp outflows from Grayscale’s GBTC (-$28.1 million) and VanEck’s HODL (-$10.9 million) reflect a shift in investor sentiment. Many investors are opting for newer ETFs with more competitive fees and improved structures. 2. Regulatory and Market Volatility Risks Despite the growing acceptance of Bitcoin ETFs, regulatory uncertainties remain a potential headwind. Additionally, Bitcoin’s inherent volatility can influence investor behavior and ETF performance, leading to rapid inflows and outflows. 3. Competitive Landscape The proliferation of spot Bitcoin ETFs has created intense competition among providers. Firms must continuously innovate to retain and attract investors, particularly as new entrants emerge in the market. Spot Bitcoin ETFs vs. Futures-Based ETFs Spot Bitcoin ETFs Spot ETFs are backed by actual Bitcoin holdings, offering investors direct exposure to the cryptocurrency’s market price. These funds are widely regarded as more transparent and efficient compared to futures-based ETFs. Futures-Based ETFs Futures-based ETFs, such as the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), derive their value from Bitcoin futures contracts rather than the spot price. While they offer an alternative for investors, futures ETFs are often subject to tracking errors and higher costs due to contract rollovers. The preference for spot ETFs is evident from the consistent inflows they have received, especially from institutional investors. Implications of Rising Bitcoin ETF Inflows 1. Increased Market Liquidity The $353.1 million inflow into spot Bitcoin ETFs adds liquidity to the broader Bitcoin market, potentially reducing volatility and fostering price stability. 2. Institutional Validation of Bitcoin The significant inflows highlight the growing role of institutional investors in the cryptocurrency market. ETFs serve as a bridge between traditional finance and digital assets, further legitimizing Bitcoin as an investment asset class. 3. Shift Toward Newer Offerings The contrasting performance of funds like BlackRock’s IBIT and Grayscale’s GBTC underscores a shift in investor preferences. Investors are increasingly gravitating toward ETFs with competitive fees, robust features, and strong backing from established financial institutions. Future Outlook for Bitcoin ETFs 1. Sustained Growth in Institutional Adoption As more institutions embrace Bitcoin, demand for spot ETFs is likely to remain strong. Firms like BlackRock and Fidelity are well-positioned to lead this growth due to their established reputations and market influence. 2. Expansion into Global Markets The success of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs could pave the way for similar offerings in international markets. Countries with progressive regulatory environments may adopt similar products, further driving global adoption. 3. Potential for Price Impact The growing demand for Bitcoin-backed ETFs could increase buying pressure on the underlying asset, potentially driving Bitcoin’s price higher. Conclusion: Bitcoin ETFs Solidify Their Role in the Market The $353.1 million net inflow into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on December 2 reflects strong investor confidence and growing demand for Bitcoin-backed investment products. With BlackRock’s IBIT leading the charge, the sustained inflows demonstrate the increasing role of spot ETFs in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the cryptocurrency market. As these funds continue to gain traction, their impact on Bitcoin’s liquidity, market stability, and global adoption will likely grow. For investors, spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a compelling combination of simplicity, security, and regulatory oversight, making them a preferred choice for accessing the crypto market.

37171836,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=106510,1733229379,Crypto Strategist Predicts Ether Surge Will Spark Altcoin Rally,"ETH Upsurge Expected to Trigger Altcoin Breakouts Prominent crypto strategist Rekt Capital has forecasted a significant uptrend in Ether (ETH) , which he believes will catalyze a broader rally across altcoins. According to a report by The Daily Hodl , ETH’s recent breakthrough of a major resistance level is a key milestone, setting the stage for an imminent wave of capital inflows into the altcoin market. The weekly close above $3,700 marked a pivotal moment for ETH, signaling the start of a bullish trend that could shift capital from Bitcoin (BTC) to Ethereum and subsequently into smaller-cap altcoins. This progression, often referred to as a “money flow cycle,” underscores Ethereum’s role as a market leader in driving altcoin momentum. Why ETH’s Surge Matters for Altcoins 1. Key Resistance Breakthrough at $3,700 ETH has broken a long-standing resistance level, reinforcing its bullish outlook. A sustained move above $3,700 could draw significant capital from investors seeking new opportunities in the crypto market. 2. Ethereum’s Leadership in Large-Cap Funds As the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum often dictates market trends, particularly for large-cap assets. ETH’s rally typically signals increased investor confidence, leading to a shift of capital into altcoins. 3. Money Flow Dynamics Phase 1: Capital flows into Bitcoin during the early stages of a market cycle. Phase 2: Investors transition funds from Bitcoin to Ethereum as its bullish momentum grows. Phase 3: Gains from Ethereum are rotated into altcoins, sparking a broad market rally. Rekt Capital predicts that ETH’s breakout will initiate this cycle, creating opportunities for smaller-cap altcoins to thrive. Historical Precedents for ETH-Led Altcoin Rallies 2017 Bull Run Ethereum’s massive gains in 2017 preceded a historic altcoin season, with several projects achieving exponential growth. 2021 Altcoin Boom ETH’s climb to new highs in early 2021 triggered a wave of rallies in decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Layer-2 projects. 2024 Outlook A repeat of this pattern could be underway, as ETH’s price strength sets the foundation for the next altcoin season. What Altcoin Investors Should Watch For 1. Large-Cap Altcoins Leading the Charge Tokens like Binance Coin (BNB), Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL) may follow ETH’s momentum, offering the first signs of a broader rally. 2. Sector-Specific Gains DeFi Tokens: Projects like Uniswap (UNI) and Aave (AAVE) could benefit from increased interest in decentralized finance. Layer-2 Solutions: Optimism (OP) and Arbitrum (ARB) may attract attention as scalability solutions gain traction. NFT Ecosystem Tokens: Platforms like Axie Infinity (AXS) and Chiliz (CHZ) could ride the wave of renewed interest in digital assets. 3. Smaller-Cap Gems Altcoin seasons often reward smaller-cap projects with high potential but lower market penetration. Identifying these early can yield significant returns. Risks to Consider in an Altcoin Rally 1. Market Volatility Altcoins are inherently more volatile than Bitcoin and Ethereum, which could lead to sharp price swings. 2. Reliance on Ethereum’s Momentum If ETH fails to maintain its bullish trajectory, it could dampen enthusiasm for altcoins. 3. Macroeconomic Factors Regulatory developments, interest rates, and broader economic conditions could impact crypto market performance. Expert Insights: Why ETH’s Rally Is Significant Rekt Capital emphasized that ETH’s breakout above $3,700 signifies more than just price movement—it reflects a shift in investor sentiment. “This milestone suggests a capital shift from Bitcoin to ETH, initiating a new cycle of money flow. Ethereum’s leadership in large-cap fund movements will set the stage for broader altcoin rallies,” he explained. The strategist also pointed to Ethereum’s upcoming advancements in scalability and utility, which could further enhance its appeal to investors. What’s Next for ETH and Altcoins? 1. Testing Higher Resistance Levels If ETH continues its bullish momentum, the next key resistance levels are at $4,200 and $4,500. A decisive break above these levels could intensify the altcoin rally. 2. Increased Altcoin Adoption As capital rotates into altcoins, sectors like DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 are likely to see heightened activity. 3. Institutional Interest The influx of institutional capital into Ethereum could extend to high-potential altcoins, further driving the market. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Ethereum and Altcoins Ethereum’s recent surge above $3,700 marks a crucial turning point for the cryptocurrency market. With Rekt Capital predicting a capital shift from Bitcoin to ETH and subsequently to altcoins, investors are gearing up for what could be a highly lucrative altcoin season. As Ethereum continues to lead in large-cap fund movements, its performance will be a bellwether for the broader market. For altcoin investors, staying attuned to ETH’s momentum and sector-specific trends will be key to navigating this next phase of the crypto cycle.

37171835,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=106512,1733229318,Trump Family to Receive $15M from Crypto Project World Liberty Financial,"Trump Family Secures $15M from World Liberty Financial’s Crypto Initiative The Trump family is poised to receive at least $15 million from the controversial crypto project World Liberty Financial (WLF), according to details published in the project’s gold paper and reported by Bloomberg . The project, which issues the WLFI token , has raised questions due to its unique structure that funnels 75% of proceeds—after a certain threshold—directly to the Trump family as fees, bypassing traditional funding allocations for project development. This announcement coincides with the recent purchase of $30 million worth of WLFI tokens by Tron co-founder Justin Sun , meeting the minimum fundraising target set by the project after it was revised down from $300 million. What Is World Liberty Financial? World Liberty Financial is a cryptocurrency initiative reportedly backed by the Trump family. The project aims to position itself as a financial disruptor, though its framework and tokenomics have drawn scrutiny. 1. The WLFI Token Non-Tradeable: The WLFI token is not listed on exchanges and cannot be traded, making it a unique offering in the crypto space. No Revenue Sharing: The token offers no revenue-sharing model, setting it apart from many other blockchain projects. Financial Conduit: WLFI serves primarily as a vehicle to channel funds directly to the Trump family. 2. Fund Allocation 75% to Trump Family: The majority of funds raised go directly to the Trump family as fees. Project Development: A smaller portion of the funds is allocated to building and maintaining the project. Justin Sun’s $30M Investment and Revised Goals Lowered Fundraising Target World Liberty Financial initially aimed to raise $300 million but later revised its target to $30 million. Justin Sun’s Role Tron co-founder Justin Sun’s purchase of $30 million in WLFI tokens met the minimum fundraising threshold, allowing the project to fulfill its financial commitments to the Trump family. Strategic Boost: Sun’s involvement has elevated the profile of World Liberty Financial, though his motivations remain unclear. Implications of the Trump Family’s Involvement 1. Financial Benefit The Trump family stands to gain $15 million or more, solidifying their financial ties to the project. This payout has been structured as fees rather than equity, raising transparency concerns. 2. Public Perception and Controversy Critics have questioned the ethics of diverting such a large portion of proceeds to the family rather than project development. The direct financial benefit to the Trump family may attract regulatory scrutiny. 3. Impact on the Crypto Market The project’s unconventional structure could set a precedent for other high-profile individuals leveraging crypto initiatives for personal gain. Key Features and Concerns About WLFI Token Structure The WLFI token lacks tradability, making it more akin to a donation mechanism than a typical cryptocurrency. Development vs. Profit Unlike most crypto projects, where proceeds are primarily reinvested into development, WLFI prioritizes payouts to the Trump family. Transparency Issues The allocation of funds and the lack of a revenue-sharing model raise transparency and accountability concerns. Comparison with Other Crypto Projects Mainstream Projects Projects like Ethereum or Solana allocate significant resources to ecosystem development, with incentives for token holders. Celebrity-Backed Ventures Several celebrity-backed crypto projects have faced backlash for prioritizing personal gains over development. WLFI’s structure places it in a similar category, raising doubts about its long-term viability. Justin Sun’s Involvement: Strategic Move or Risky Bet? Justin Sun’s $30 million investment raises questions about his motivations. Strategic Alliance: Sun’s investment could be a calculated move to align with high-profile names like Donald Trump. Risk Factor: Sun’s involvement in a controversial project may expose him to reputational risks. Potential Risks and Challenges 1. Regulatory Scrutiny The significant financial benefit to the Trump family and the token’s non-tradeable nature could attract investigations from financial regulators. 2. Investor Skepticism The project’s focus on personal payouts over development may deter potential investors. 3. Limited Adoption With no clear use case or tradability, WLFI’s appeal may be limited, affecting the project’s growth. What’s Next for World Liberty Financial? 1. Project Development While the initial fundraising goal has been met, questions remain about how the remaining funds will be utilized to develop and sustain the project. 2. Long-Term Viability The lack of tradability and focus on payouts may hinder WLFI’s adoption and long-term success. 3. Market and Media Attention The Trump family’s involvement and Justin Sun’s investment will likely keep World Liberty Financial in the spotlight, for better or worse. Conclusion: A High-Stakes Crypto Experiment World Liberty Financial’s crypto initiative, with its focus on funneling proceeds to the Trump family, represents a unique yet controversial approach in the blockchain space. While the $15 million payout and Justin Sun’s $30 million investment have put the project on the map, concerns about transparency, development priorities, and investor protection persist. As the crypto community watches closely, the project’s success or failure could set a precedent for celebrity-backed cryptocurrency ventures. For investors and enthusiasts, understanding the risks and implications of such projects is crucial for navigating this evolving landscape.

This increase signals that the cryptocurrency market is firmly in Altcoin Season , a phase characterized by the dominance of altcoins outperforming Bitcoin. The index evaluates the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) over the past 90 days. A score above 75 confirms Altcoin Season , whereas a score below 25 indicates Bitcoin Season . How the Altcoin Season Index Works 1. Metrics Tracked The Altcoin Season Index compares the performance of the top 100 altcoins against Bitcoin: Altcoin Season: When at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin. Bitcoin Season: When only 25% or fewer altcoins outperform Bitcoin. 2. Daily Updates The index scores range from 1 to 100 and are updated daily to reflect market dynamics. 3. Exclusions Stablecoins (e.g., USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (e.g., WBTC) are excluded from the analysis to ensure accuracy. Key Factors Behind the Rise to 84 1. Ethereum’s Rally Ethereum’s (ETH) recent breakout above $3,700 has led to increased confidence in the altcoin market, triggering a flow of capital into smaller-cap altcoins. 2. Positive Market Sentiment Overall optimism in the cryptocurrency market has lifted altcoin prices. This sentiment follows significant inflows into spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which have revitalized investor interest across the crypto spectrum. 3. Sector-Specific Growth DeFi Tokens: Projects like Aave (AAVE) and Uniswap (UNI) have seen strong performance, driven by renewed interest in decentralized finance. Layer-2 Solutions: Tokens supporting scalability, such as Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP), are gaining traction. NFT Ecosystems: Altcoins tied to NFTs, including Chiliz (CHZ) and Axie Infinity (AXS), have benefited from increased market activity. What an Altcoin Season Means for Investors 1. Higher Volatility Altcoin Season often brings significant price swings. While this presents lucrative opportunities, it also amplifies risks. 2. Diversification Benefits Investors can capitalize on the broad performance of altcoins, which may outperform Bitcoin during this phase. 3. Sector-Specific Opportunities Certain sectors, such as DeFi, Layer-2 solutions, and gaming tokens, may provide outsized returns compared to the overall market. Comparison: Altcoin Season vs. Bitcoin Season Metric Altcoin Season Bitcoin Season Index Score 75–100 1–25 Market Leader Altcoins Bitcoin Performance Trend 75%+ altcoins outperform BTC 25% or fewer altcoins outperform BTC Investor Focus High-risk, high-reward altcoins Stability and BTC dominance Historical Trends of Altcoin Season Index 2021 Altcoin Boom The index peaked at 95 in mid-2021 during the DeFi and NFT bull market, signaling widespread altcoin dominance. 2023 Bear Market The index dropped below 20, marking a Bitcoin-led market as investors sought stability amidst declining altcoin prices. 2024 Outlook The current surge to 84 reflects renewed investor interest in altcoins, supported by Ethereum’s rally and a recovering cryptocurrency market. Sectors to Watch During Altcoin Season 1. DeFi (Decentralized Finance) Projects like Aave (AAVE), MakerDAO (MKR), and Uniswap (UNI) are expected to attract more capital as DeFi continues to grow. 2. Layer-2 Scaling Solutions Tokens like Polygon (MATIC), Arbitrum (ARB), and Optimism (OP) are gaining traction as they address Ethereum’s scalability challenges. 3. Gaming and Metaverse Tokens Axie Infinity (AXS), Decentraland (MANA), and Sandbox (SAND) could see increased adoption as interest in blockchain gaming and the metaverse grows. Risks to Consider During Altcoin Season 1. Market Volatility Altcoins are inherently more volatile than Bitcoin, making them susceptible to rapid price fluctuations. 2. Lack of Liquidity Smaller-cap altcoins may suffer from low liquidity, increasing the risk of price manipulation. 3. Overreliance on Market Sentiment Altcoin prices often depend heavily on market sentiment, making them vulnerable to sudden downturns. What’s Next for the Altcoin Market? 1. Sustained Momentum The Altcoin Season Index at 84 indicates strong performance across the altcoin market. If Ethereum maintains its bullish trajectory, altcoins could see further gains. 2. Key Resistance Levels Ethereum breaking above $4,200 could provide a further boost to altcoins. Investors should watch Bitcoin dominance; a decline could signal continued capital rotation into altcoins. 3. Emerging Sectors New narratives, such as AI-powered blockchain projects or green crypto solutions, could capture investor interest during this season. Conclusion: Capitalizing on Altcoin Season The Altcoin Season Index’s rise to 84 underscores the strong momentum in the altcoin market, driven by Ethereum’s rally and sector-specific growth. For investors, this phase presents an opportunity to explore high-performing altcoins while remaining cautious about inherent risks.

Top 3 contenders,"With the ever-changing landscape of cryptocurrency, investors are all on a hunt for the next billion-dollar opportunity. With numerous altcoins vying for attention, three contenders stand out as potential candidates to reach the coveted $1 mark: The altcoins of Rexas Finance (RXS), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Tron (TRX). Despite the similar launch, each of these tokens has different characteristics and dynamics in the market that could propel them towards this milestone. The rising star: Rexas Finance (RXS) Crypto chatter is buzzing over Rexas Finance, which is taking an innovative approach to real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. RXS is currently in its presale status and continues to pull in investor interest as it has so far raised over $19 million of a $20.75 million target. In Stage 8, the presale is currently priced at $0.10 per token, which is expected to go up to $0.125 in the next stage. The reason for this steady increase is that everyone wants RXS, and so far, early investors are super optimistic about the future of RXS. Rexas Finance @rexasfinance · Follow ⭐️ Milestone Alert! ⭐️Rexas Finance has successfully raised $19.7 Million! 🚀Thank you for your support! 👍Buy Now: Rexas.com #rexas $RXS #rexasfinance #crypto 11:34 PM · Nov 30, 2024 27 Reply Copy link Read 1 reply Alongside its ambitious goals, the company provides robust security measures to secure users’ investments that are so appealing in the name of Rexas Finance. CertiK rigorously audited the project and found it safe and reliable. That is why RXS is listed on large platforms such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, helping it to increase its visibility and credibility. Investors are especially excited about Rexas Finance’s potential to transform how we tokenize and trade assets. By bridging traditional investments with blockchain technology, RXS could reform the way we own nearly every asset class: real estate, commodities, etc. Rexas Finance offers an innovative approach, which, according to analysts, could see it hitting $1 as it finds favor among investors in the aftermath of the launch. The memetic powerhouse: Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin has become one of the most capable players in the cryptocurrency game. DOGE is currently changing hands around $0.40 and has shown to be very strong and versatile. Analysts are also optimistic about its trajectory, considering what they have seen in its daily charts in recent days, including a Bullish Pennant breakout from such formation. Trader Tardigrade @TATrader_Alan · Follow #Dogecoin daily chart shows a Bullish Pennant and $Doge is very likely to BREAKOUT the pennant soon 🔥The measured target from the pole is $1.3 🚀 2:38 PM · Nov 30, 2024 1.2K Reply Copy link Read 66 replies Analysts predict Dogecoin’s price to range from $1 to even higher by 2025. DOGE is an enthusiastic community that has historically fuelled interest and investment in many instances via celebrity endorsements. Moreover, the recovery of the entire cryptocurrency market continues to gain traction which can further push Dogecoin in trying to overcome psychological resistance levels. Dogecoin is capturing public attention and media coverage, and as this price rises, it is likely to be driven by speculative trading and supporting social media hype. With all these factors in play, it becomes natural that DOGE has every reason to skyrocket and potentially hit the $1 mark sooner rather than later. The Blockchain Innovator: Tron (TRX) While Tron is a known player in the blockchain space, it has been involved in building decentralized applications (dApps) and content sharing for a long time. Right now, if you’re looking for a current price on TRX, it’s worth around $0.20, and there has been some (literally) big news with its founder, Justin Sun, investing big into a couple of high-profile projects which include a huge $30 million dollar chunk of the Trump’s crypto initiative.

37171764,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=106518,1733229182,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Dips to 76, Remains in ‘Extreme Greed’ Zone","Crypto Fear & Greed Index Declines Slightly to 76 On December 3, 2024, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a key metric reflecting market sentiment, registered 76 , down four points from the previous day’s score of 80 . Despite the dip, the index remains firmly in the “Extreme Greed” zone, signaling heightened enthusiasm among cryptocurrency investors. The index, developed by Alternative.me , ranges from 0 to 100 , where lower scores indicate fear and higher scores represent greed. A score above 75 signifies “Extreme Greed,” while a score below 25 denotes “Extreme Fear.” Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index 1. How It Works The index aggregates data from six factors to quantify overall market sentiment: Volatility (25%): High price swings indicate fear, while stability suggests greed. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Increased buying volumes contribute to greed. Social Media (15%): Positive mentions and activity on platforms like Twitter drive greed. Surveys (15%): Investor sentiment surveys (when available) influence the score. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Higher Bitcoin dominance signals fear, as altcoins typically thrive during greed phases. Google Trends (10%): Increased searches for terms like “Bitcoin price” reflect heightened interest and greed. 2. Zones of Sentiment Extreme Fear (0–25): Signals market panic, often presenting buying opportunities. Fear (26–49): Indicates caution among investors. Neutral (50): Balanced sentiment with no clear directional bias. Greed (51–75): Reflects optimism and potential overvaluation. Extreme Greed (76–100): Suggests euphoria, often preceding corrections. Why the Index Fell by Four Points 1. Market Consolidation The slight decline in the index may reflect profit-taking or consolidation after recent rallies in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). 2. Cooling Social Media Sentiment Lower engagement levels on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit could have contributed to the dip in the sentiment score. 3. Volatility Adjustments A stabilization in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices, following weeks of upward momentum, may have tempered market exuberance. Implications of Staying in ‘Extreme Greed’ 1. Cautious Optimism While remaining in the “Extreme Greed” zone signals continued bullish sentiment, it also raises concerns about potential overvaluation and market corrections. 2. Investor Behavior Historically, “Extreme Greed” phases are associated with: Increased speculative trading. Elevated risk appetite among retail investors. 3. Market Opportunities and Risks Opportunities: Altcoins may see additional gains as investors diversify during greedy phases. Risks: Sudden corrections are more likely, especially if sentiment turns negative or external shocks occur. Historical Performance During ‘Extreme Greed’ Phases 2021 Bull Run During Bitcoin’s rally to $69,000 in late 2021, the index consistently stayed above 75, reflecting euphoria. However, this was followed by a sharp correction as profit-taking set in. 2023 Recovery In early 2023, the index fluctuated between greed and extreme greed during Bitcoin’s recovery from bear market lows, signaling sustained investor optimism. 2024 Context The current score of 76 aligns with ongoing bullish trends in Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggesting strong market sentiment despite minor pullbacks. What This Means for Investors 1. Opportunities Altcoin Rally Potential: Strong sentiment often benefits altcoins, as investors seek higher returns beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Short-Term Gains: Greedy phases are typically favorable for momentum traders looking to capitalize on price surges. 2. Risks Corrections: Extreme greed often precedes market pullbacks, as overly optimistic sentiment can lead to overvaluation. FOMO Investing: Retail investors may succumb to fear of missing out (FOMO), leading to poorly timed investments. 3. Strategy Recommendations Diversify Holdings: Spread investments across multiple assets to mitigate risks. Take Partial Profits: Lock in gains during greedy phases to reduce exposure to sudden downturns. Monitor Sentiment Trends: Keep an eye on daily sentiment changes to anticipate market shifts. Future Outlook for the Crypto Market 1. Sustained Optimism If the index remains in the “Extreme Greed” zone, it could signal continued bullish momentum for Bitcoin and altcoins. 2. Potential Market Cooling A further decline in sentiment could lead to consolidation or corrections, offering buying opportunities for long-term investors. 3. Macro and Regulatory Factors Broader economic conditions and cryptocurrency regulations will play a pivotal role in shaping sentiment and price movements in the coming weeks. Conclusion: Navigating the ‘Extreme Greed’ Zone The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s dip to 76 reflects a slight cooling of sentiment, but the market remains firmly in “Extreme Greed.” This phase indicates continued bullishness, albeit with heightened risks of corrections. For investors, this is a time to balance optimism with caution, leveraging short-term opportunities while safeguarding against potential downturns.

37171746,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=106522,1733229109,Crypto Market May Cool After Trump Inauguration: Analysts Predict a Temporary Slowdown,"Crypto Rally Faces Potential Slowdown As the cryptocurrency market experiences a post-election surge, analysts caution that the bullish momentum could ease following Donald Trump’s inauguration as U.S. President on January 20, 2025 . Historically, markets tend to stabilize or correct after the initial optimism of a political event fades, and the crypto market may follow this trend. Bitcoin (BTC) has gained over 30% since Trump’s election victory in November, climbing to near $75,000 , while altcoins have followed with significant rallies. However, Bitget Research , as reported by Cointelegraph , suggests that a short-term correction to $70,000 is possible before the next upward leg begins. While the broader crypto market remains optimistic, the path forward will depend on key factors such as regulatory clarity, macroeconomic conditions, and the evolving sentiment of investors. Post-Election Optimism Drives the Rally Bitcoin’s Surge Bitcoin, often seen as a bellwether for the crypto market, has surged over 30% since Trump’s election win, fueled by institutional inflows, renewed adoption, and positive sentiment. Key Milestone: Bitcoin has approached $75,000 , its highest level since the last bull market in late 2021. Institutional Interest: Large-scale inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, particularly spot ETFs approved earlier in the year, have contributed to its price appreciation. Altcoins Ride the Wave Following Bitcoin’s lead, major altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and Solana (SOL) have posted strong gains. This reflects a broader bullish sentiment that typically accompanies Bitcoin rallies. Historical Parallels 2016 Election: During Trump’s first presidential campaign, Bitcoin saw moderate gains, followed by increased momentum after regulatory signals clarified the government’s stance on crypto. 2020 Election: Similarly, the crypto market rallied following Biden’s election, fueled by institutional participation and the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi). Why the Rally May Slow After the Inauguration 1. Historical Trends of Market Cooling Analysts point out that market rallies often lose steam after the initial excitement surrounding a major political event dissipates. This phenomenon is not unique to crypto; traditional equity markets frequently exhibit similar behavior. 2. Regulatory Uncertainty While Trump’s policies are expected to favor economic growth, his administration’s specific stance on cryptocurrency remains uncertain. Potential Regulatory Risks: Any adverse regulatory announcements could temporarily dampen investor enthusiasm. Opportunity for Clarity: On the other hand, a clear pro-crypto stance could reignite momentum. 3. Possible Bitcoin Correction Bitget Research forecasts a short-term pullback to $70,000 , reflecting a consolidation phase before resuming upward momentum. Profit-Taking: Investors may lock in gains after Bitcoin’s rapid ascent, leading to temporary downward pressure. Healthy Consolidation: Such corrections often provide a foundation for stronger, sustained growth. Broader Market Influences on Crypto 1. Correlation with U.S. Equities While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have shown weaker ties to Nasdaq stocks in recent months, their performance remains partially influenced by broader equity market trends. Investor Sentiment: A downturn in U.S. equities could impact crypto, as traditional markets still serve as sentiment indicators. Inflation and Interest Rates: Macroeconomic factors, including inflation and Federal Reserve policies, continue to affect risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. 2. Institutional Participation The influx of institutional capital into crypto has brought both stability and market risks. ETFs as Catalysts: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier in 2024 has driven significant institutional inflows, supporting the recent rally. Exposure to Broader Trends: Institutions balancing crypto with traditional asset portfolios may influence market volatility. What Lies Ahead for the Crypto Market? 1. Sustained Bull Market in 2025 Despite short-term volatility, analysts remain optimistic about the long-term trajectory of the crypto market. Bitcoin Price Targets: Analysts predict Bitcoin could break past $100,000 by the second half of 2025, driven by increased adoption and reduced supply following the 2024 halving. Altcoin Growth: Ethereum and other altcoins are expected to see significant gains as decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 technologies gain traction. 2. Regulatory Developments Trump’s administration has the potential to shape the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies. Favorable Policies: Pro-business policies may encourage innovation and adoption in the crypto sector. Risks of Overregulation: Conversely, stricter regulations could slow market growth in the short term. 3. Key Support and Resistance Levels Support: Analysts identify $70,000 as a crucial support level for Bitcoin during potential corrections. Resistance: The next psychological barrier is $80,000 , which could pave the way for further gains if breached. Strategies for Investors During a Cooling Period 1. Diversify Investments Allocate funds across a mix of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and promising altcoins to mitigate risks. Consider exposure to different sectors, including DeFi, gaming tokens, and layer-2 solutions. 2. Take Partial Profits Lock in gains near key resistance levels to safeguard against potential corrections. Reinvest during dips to capitalize on lower entry points. 3. Monitor Macro Indicators Keep an eye on broader economic trends, including Federal Reserve policies and equity market performance. Regulatory announcements could serve as major catalysts for market movements. The Role of Altcoins in the 2025 Bull Market 1. Ethereum Leading the Way Ethereum’s (ETH) recent rally to $3,700 has reinforced its position as a market leader. DeFi Expansion: Ethereum remains the backbone of decentralized finance, attracting both developers and investors. Layer-2 Growth: Solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism are further enhancing Ethereum’s scalability and adoption. 2. Emerging Altcoin Sectors Gaming and NFTs: Tokens like Axie Infinity (AXS) and Chiliz (CHZ) may benefit from renewed interest in blockchain-based entertainment. DeFi Innovations: Projects such as Aave (AAVE) and Uniswap (UNI) continue to attract capital as DeFi adoption grows. Risks to Watch Out For 1. Market Volatility Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, and rapid price swings could occur during periods of uncertainty. 2. Overreliance on Sentiment The crypto market remains highly sentiment-driven, making it susceptible to abrupt changes in investor confidence. 3. External Shocks Unexpected events, such as regulatory crackdowns or macroeconomic shifts, could disrupt the market’s upward trajectory. Conclusion: Balancing Optimism with Caution The crypto market’s rally, fueled by post-election optimism and institutional inflows, has positioned Bitcoin and altcoins for a strong finish to 2024. However, analysts caution that the momentum could slow following Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20, 2025, as the market consolidates and recalibrates. With Bitcoin potentially correcting to $70,000 before resuming its climb, investors should remain vigilant, balancing short-term caution with a long-term perspective. As the broader market matures, opportunities for growth in altcoins, decentralized finance, and blockchain innovations will continue to shape the crypto landscape.

37171990,https://thecoinrise.com/crypto-trading-volumes-surge-to-three-year-high-in-november-amid-political-shifts/,1733229054,Crypto Trading Volumes Surge to Three-Year High in November Amid Political Shifts,"November proved to be a standout month for the cryptocurrency market, with exchange volumes reaching a three-year high. According to data from crypto market tracker New Hedge, spot exchange volumes hit an impressive $2.9 trillion, the highest level since May 2021. This surge was largely attributed to the surprise victory of Donald Trump in the U.S. elections, which sparked renewed optimism in the crypto sector. Many market observers noted that the shift in political power, combined with growing hopes of more favorable regulatory frameworks, led to a boost in investor sentiment. Record Trading Volumes in November Crypto exchange platforms, including Crypto.com, saw record trading volumes throughout the month. A spokesperson from the exchange confirmed that November had been the platform’s strongest month of the past year, noting that both interest and investment in cryptocurrencies had been steadily increasing. “We anticipate positive market sentiment will continue into the first quarter of next year,” the spokesperson added. With the election results, which saw pro-crypto candidates gaining seats in Congress, the industry is hopeful for a more crypto-friendly environment in the U.S. This has fueled predictions that the country may soon become one of the most crypto-supportive governments globally, driving future market growth. Regulatory Clarity Drive Volume Outside the United States, the momentum continues to build. Jurisdictions around the world are introducing or committing to clearer regulatory frameworks for digital assets, providing more certainty for both investors and market participants. These moves are seen as pivotal in driving global adoption, which in turn has contributed to increased trading volumes. Experts believe that the continued regulatory clarity, particularly in major markets, will help sustain this upward trend in crypto market activity. Jonathon Miller, Kraken’s managing director for Australia, also weighed in on the surge. His exchange saw solid performance in November, particularly in perpetual contract volumes. Bitcoin futures remained the dominant asset in trading, but other tokens, like Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE), saw unprecedented activity . Miller noted that Dogecoin’s 24-hour trading volume even surpassed that of Ether for the first time, highlighting the increasing interest in memecoins amid the recent market rally. With volatility as a key driver, these assets have provided ample trading opportunities, and they stand to benefit as market momentum continues.

37171745,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=106524,1733229054,EUR-Backed Stablecoin Trade Volumes Hit Yearly High with Tenfold Surge,"Sharp Rise in EUR-Backed Stablecoin Trade Volumes Reaches Yearly High Trade volumes of EUR-backed stablecoins have surged to unprecedented levels, increasing from $5 million in October to over $70 million in early November 2024 , according to Kaiko , a leading crypto research firm, as reported by Unfolded on X. This marks a remarkable tenfold increase , setting a yearly high for this asset class. What Are EUR-Backed Stablecoins? 1. Definition and Functionality EUR-backed stablecoins are a subset of cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of the Euro (€). Price Stability: Their primary appeal lies in providing price stability akin to fiat currencies, reducing exposure to crypto market volatility. Use Cases: These stablecoins are widely used for trading, cross-border payments, and as a bridge between fiat and crypto markets. 2. Examples of EUR-Backed Stablecoins Popular EUR-backed stablecoins include: EURT (Tether EUR): Issued by Tether, one of the most prominent stablecoin providers. EURS (Stasis): A Euro-pegged stablecoin focusing on transparency and compliance. EUROC (Circle): Developed by Circle, the issuer of the widely used USD Coin (USDC). Key Drivers of the Surge 1. Rising Demand in European Markets Increased Crypto Adoption: Europe’s growing crypto adoption has fueled demand for Euro-denominated assets. Regulatory Clarity: Clearer regulations in the EU, including the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, have enhanced investor confidence. 2. Cross-Border Payment Efficiency EUR-backed stablecoins are gaining traction as efficient tools for cross-border payments. Lower Fees: Compared to traditional banking systems, stablecoin transactions are faster and incur lower fees. Growing Use in Trade Settlements: Businesses and individuals are increasingly using EUR-backed stablecoins for trade and remittances. 3. Diversification Beyond USD Stablecoins The dominance of USD-backed stablecoins, such as USDT and USDC, has prompted investors to diversify their holdings. Regional Preference: European traders and institutions prefer Euro-based assets for localized transactions. Hedging Against Currency Risks: EUR-backed stablecoins provide a hedge against fluctuations in the USD-Euro exchange rate. The Role of Major Platforms in Driving Volumes 1. Increased Exchange Listings Leading exchanges like Binance , Kraken , and Coinbase have expanded support for EUR-backed stablecoins, enhancing accessibility and liquidity. 2. Integration with DeFi Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Platforms such as Aave and Curve are integrating EUR-backed stablecoins into their ecosystems, enabling lending, borrowing, and liquidity provision. 3. Payment Providers and On-Ramps Partnerships with payment providers and fiat-to-crypto gateways have made EUR-backed stablecoins more accessible to European users. Implications for the Crypto Market 1. Strengthened Role of Non-USD Stablecoins The sharp rise in EUR-backed stablecoin volumes underscores a broader trend of diversification within the stablecoin market. Globalization of Crypto: The growing adoption of non-USD stablecoins highlights the increasing globalization of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. 2. Enhanced Liquidity in Euro-Denominated Markets The rise in volumes boosts liquidity for Euro-based trading pairs, benefiting traders and institutions operating within the European market. 3. Competitive Landscape The competition among EUR-backed stablecoins could drive further innovation and adoption, particularly as issuers focus on enhancing transparency, regulatory compliance, and user experience. Challenges Facing EUR-Backed Stablecoins 1. Regulatory Risks While MiCA provides a framework for crypto assets in the EU, potential changes in policies could impact the growth trajectory of EUR-backed stablecoins. 2. Limited Adoption Outside Europe Adoption remains concentrated in Europe, limiting global utility compared to USD-backed stablecoins. 3. Liquidity and Market Depth Despite rising volumes, liquidity and market depth for EUR-backed stablecoins still lag behind their USD counterparts. Future Outlook for EUR-Backed Stablecoins 1. Continued Growth in Adoption Mainstream Acceptance: As more businesses integrate stablecoins into payment systems, EUR-backed options are likely to gain further traction. Institutional Interest: European financial institutions may increasingly leverage EUR-backed stablecoins for settlement and asset management. 2. Expansion into Emerging Markets Growth in adoption outside Europe could drive further demand, particularly in regions with strong trade ties to the EU. 3. Integration with CBDCs The potential launch of a digital Euro (CBDC) could complement the growth of EUR-backed stablecoins, creating synergies between public and private digital assets. Conclusion: A Breakout Year for EUR-Backed Stablecoins The tenfold surge in EUR-backed stablecoin trade volumes , from $5 million in October to $70 million in November 2024 , marks a significant milestone for this asset class. Driven by rising demand in Europe, regulatory clarity, and diversification away from USD-dominated markets, these stablecoins are poised for further growth. While challenges such as limited global adoption and regulatory risks remain, the broader trends suggest that EUR-backed stablecoins will play an increasingly vital role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. For traders, investors, and businesses, their rise signals new opportunities in Euro-denominated markets.

37171867,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51202,1733229026,"Crypto Game-Changers: Qubetics Rockets Past $4.1M Presale, Hedera Invests $408M in Growth, and Polkadot Revamps Web3 Gaming","In a world where blockchain innovation knows no bounds, Qubetics, Hedera, and Polkadot are emerging as the torchbearers of crypto evolution. Each project is carving its niche, whether it’s Qubetics redefining interoperability, Hedera venturing into the cosmos, or Polkadot bridging blockchains with unmatched scalability. While traditional crypto projects have paved the way, these three contenders are rewriting the rules. Qubetics, in particular, is solving challenges like accessibility and cross-chain inefficiencies, making it one of the best crypto investment opportunities of 2024. Let’s break it down. Qubetics ($TICS): Pioneering Blockchain Interoperability Qubetics is a groundbreaking ecosystem reshaping how we interact with blockchain. At its heart is a multi-chain wallet that eliminates the chaos of juggling multiple wallets. Whether you’re managing Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana, Qubetics makes it seamless. But the real magic lies in QubeQode IDE, a revolutionary drag-and-drop interface for blockchain app development. Picture a small business owner in Denver creating a decentralised payment solution or a solo entrepreneur in Miami launching their NFT marketplace—all without writing a single line of code. QubeQode IDE transforms blockchain development into a breeze. Qubetics’ presale is currently in its 11th stage, with more than 259 million tokens sold, raising over $4.1 million. The token, priced at $0.0282, is projected to hit $0.25 at presale’s end, delivering an 871% ROI. Analysts predict it could soar to $15 after the mainnet launch, equating to an eye-popping 58,213% ROI. Investing $85,000 at the current price could yield over $49 million if these predictions hold true. Curious about how Qubetics simplifies the crypto journey? Explore its multi-chain wallet and see the IDE in action. For more insights into its transformative vision, watch this video . Hedera (HBAR): Taking Blockchain Beyond Earth Hedera is boldly going where no blockchain has gone before—space. Partnering with SpaceX, Hedera aims to enable crypto transactions between satellites, a visionary move that could revolutionise interplanetary commerce. Imagine paying for satellite bandwidth or transferring funds between Earth and Mars. It sounds like sci-fi, but Hedera is making it a reality. HBAR has already seen a bullish streak, surging 71.67% to $0.155 this month. Analysts forecast further growth as its partnership with SpaceX develops. Beyond its extraterrestrial ambitions, Hedera’s Hashgraph technology offers unparalleled speed and scalability, making it an attractive choice for enterprises. From supply chain tracking to secure payments, Hedera’s real-world use cases make it one of the best crypto investment options for forward-thinking investors. This partnership isn’t just about space. It’s about showcasing Hedera’s adaptability and vision. With Elon Musk’s backing, the project is positioned to draw significant attention and capital in the coming years. For those looking to invest in projects that push boundaries, HBAR is a stellar option. Polkadot (DOT): The Bridge to Blockchain Scalability Polkadot is a name that’s synonymous with innovation in the blockchain world. With its unique parachain architecture, Polkadot allows different blockchains to communicate and share information seamlessly. This ability to bridge diverse ecosystems sets it apart as a leading player in the race for blockchain scalability. Polkadot has been on a tear lately, surging 117% to $8.85 in just a week. A recent partnership with São Paulo’s investment agency is fuelling this growth. By sponsoring blockchain training programs, Polkadot is not only expanding its developer community but also laying the groundwork for future adoption. The addition of new parachains has further solidified its position. Imagine a healthcare blockchain communicating with a supply chain network to ensure medicine authenticity—Polkadot makes it possible. With plans for more partnerships and educational initiatives, DOT is primed for long-term growth, making it a strong contender for the best crypto investment. Why These Projects Stand Out Qubetics, Hedera, and Polkadot aren’t just surviving in the crypto space; they’re thriving by addressing real-world challenges. Qubetics simplifies blockchain interaction with unparalleled tools like QubeQode. Hedera is pushing the envelope with space-based crypto transactions, while Polkadot is creating a truly interoperable blockchain ecosystem. These aren’t mere speculative bets. They’re strategic investments in projects with tangible use cases and visionary goals. Whether it’s generating massive ROI with Qubetics, participating in Hedera’s interstellar ambitions, or leveraging Polkadot’s scalability, the opportunities are endless. Conclusion: Your Best Crypto Investment Awaits The crypto market moves fast, but the potential rewards are worth the risk. Whether you’re drawn to Qubetics ’ transformative ROI potential, Hedera’s pioneering space partnerships, or Polkadot’s unmatched scalability, each of these projects offers a unique value proposition. What’s your next move? Whether it’s seizing Qubetics’ groundbreaking ROI opportunities, supporting Hedera’s cosmic ventures, or embracing Polkadot’s scalable future, the choice is yours. The blockchain revolution is happening now—don’t wait to secure your spot in this transformative journey.

37171715,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656415,1733229022,CryptoQuant CEO Warns Not To Short XRP Due To Insider Whale Activity,"XRP has experienced an extraordinary surge in recent weeks, with its price skyrocketing by 380% over the past 23 days. In just the last four days, the price jumped 75%, reaching a peak of $2.87 on December 2. This rapid ascent appears to be fueled by significant buying activity from large investors, commonly known as “whales.” Ki Young Ju, CEO of on-chain analysis firm CryptoQuant, highlighted that these whales are primarily operating through the US based exchange Coinbase. On December 2, he pointed out that “Coinbase whales are driving this XRP rally,” noting that Coinbase’s minute-level price premium ranged from 3% to 13% during the surge. In contrast, Upbit—a Korean exchange with more XRP investors than Binance—showed no significant premium, suggesting the buying pressure is predominantly originating from the United States. On his alternative X account (@kate_young_ju), Ki Young Ju hinted at possible insider activity influencing the market dynamics, stating, “Someone knew something.” Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Analyst Says History Is Repeating Itself, Here’s How Today, he cautioned traders against shorting XRP. “Shorting XRP right now seems risky, imo. $25B XRP deposit before the pump might look like market manipulation but could simply be front-running. This insider whale might know something extremely bullish about XRP, such as spot ETF approval,” he speculated. He further shared a chart “XRP: Retail Activity Through Trading Frequency Surge (Spot & Futures), which indicates that retail trading activity for XRP has surpassed the highs of 2021 and is nearing levels last seen in January 2018, when XRP reached its all-time high of $3.92. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Litecoin Is About To Pull An XRP, Here’s What He Means Observing the one-year cumulative volume delta (CVD) of taker buy/sell volume, he remarked: “1-year CVD of Taker Buy/Sell Volume for XRP shows a historic rebound. Whales are aggressively using market orders, driving overwhelming demand.” A 700% Rallye Incoming For XRP Against BTC? From a technical analysis perspective, crypto analyst Jacob Canfield emphasizes the importance of examining the XRP/BTC pairing. He notes that XRP is currently at a critical resistance zone on the BTC pair chart (XRPBTC), having just reached the $2.75 level on the USDT pair—a resistance point since December 2019. Canfield suggests that a breakout here could signal a potential 240% move back to key resistance zones from 2017, 2018, and 2019. “If we get real FOMO, then we could be setting up for another 700% move to all-time high against Bitcoin,” he commented, acknowledging the “two of the strongest monthly candles for XRP that we’ve seen in over 5 years.” Looking at shorter time-frames of the XRP/USD pair, Canfield highlights the utility of support and resistance levels to identify new entry points in these time frames. “In bull markets, you need to use low time frame support/resistance to find new entries. 5 min/15 min are the best. XRP as an example – $2.20 was the clear S/R invalidation. Base of the biggest green candle = base of impulse. Usually the best place to re-enter a trade.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.63.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate headlines, newer projects are quietly revolutionising the blockchain space. Investors who diversified into innovative tokens like Stellar (XLM) and Aave (AAVE) saw their patience rewarded with robust returns. But what if you missed those early opportunities? Now’s your chance to capitalise on the explosive potential of Qubetics ($TICS) , an emerging blockchain powerhouse poised to address real-world inefficiencies like never before. Qubetics is not just another blockchain—it’s a complete ecosystem. With the revolutionary QubeQode IDE, this project empowers businesses and developers to create blockchain apps seamlessly. As the $TICS presale hits its 10th stage, excitement is brewing for the token, as analysts predict it could climb from $0.0257 to $15 after its mainnet launch, offering an ROI unheard of in today’s market. Let’s explore why this revolutionary project deserves your attention in 2024. Qubetics ($TICS): Simplifying Blockchain, Amplifying Returns The Qubetics ecosystem aims to tackle the barriers holding blockchain adoption back, such as complex development and high entry costs. Central to this is the QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE), a tool that simplifies blockchain app creation through drag-and-drop components and AI-driven coding assistance. Imagine a fintech startup wanting to create a payment dApp but lacking technical expertise. With QubeQode IDE , they can deploy smart contracts without writing intricate code, cutting development time and cost. Small businesses can design secure supply chain solutions, and even non-tech-savvy individuals can create decentralised apps using intuitive tools. This broad accessibility is what makes Qubetics revolutionary. Currently, in its 10th presale stage, Qubetics presale has already raised $3.5 million, selling over 235 million tokens to 4,600+ holders. At just $0.0257 per token, early adopters are securing their share before the price rises by 10% this weekend. Analysts predict $TICS will surge to $1 post-presale and $15 after the mainnet launch, translating into an ROI of over 58,000%. A $2,000 investment today could yield nearly $1.16 million if these predictions materialise. With features like gasless transactions, quantum-resistant security, and seamless EVM compatibility, Qubetics is well-positioned to lead the next wave of blockchain innovation. Stellar (XLM): The Blockchain for Borderless Finance Stellar is redefining cross-border payments by making them faster, cheaper, and more inclusive. Unlike traditional systems riddled with inefficiencies and high costs, Stellar’s blockchain facilitates near-instant transactions for a fraction of the cost. Recently, Stellar’s Total Value Locked (TVL) skyrocketed to an all-time high of $56.4 million, reflecting its growing ecosystem activity. Open Interest (OI) also rose by $70 million last week, signalling increased investor confidence. Trading at $0.54, XLM has rebounded from a pullback and could retest its May 2021 high of $0.79 if current trends persist. For example, remittance service providers in developing countries use Stellar to offer affordable money transfers to millions who lack access to traditional banking. As its ecosystem grows, Stellar could play a pivotal role in global finance, making it an attractive long-term investment. Aave (AAVE): The Pioneer of Decentralised Lending Aave has become synonymous with decentralised finance (DeFi), enabling users to lend and borrow digital assets without intermediaries. In 2024, Aave’s platform saw deposits skyrocket to $33 billion, making it a leader in the DeFi space. The recent breakout above $200 marked a turning point for AAVE’s price trajectory. Trading at $208, the token could climb to $260 if bulls maintain momentum above $215. Conversely, a dip below $194 could see a retracement to its 20-day EMA at $183, offering a buying opportunity. Aave’s utility is undeniable. Imagine a developer leveraging Aave to create an automated savings dApp that provides users with better interest rates than traditional banks. With its cutting-edge features, Aave empowers users to achieve financial autonomy while cementing its place in the DeFi sector. Why You Should Pay Attention Now Timing is everything in crypto. The Qubetics presale, with tokens priced at just $0.0257, offers a rare opportunity to secure a stake in a project forecasted to deliver staggering ROI. Stellar and Aave, with their proven use cases and robust ecosystems, complement Qubetics as key assets for a diversified portfolio. For those willing to invest $2,000 in Qubetics now, the potential returns by the mainnet launch could redefine your financial future. Meanwhile, Stellar and Aave provide stability and growth prospects that align with the broader adoption of blockchain technology. Conclusion: Your Portfolio’s Next Big Leap Cryptocurrencies like Qubetics, Stellar, and Aave are not just tokens—they’re transforming industries. Qubetics is pioneering blockchain accessibility with its QubeQode IDE, Stellar is reshaping global finance, and Aave continues to innovate in DeFi. Together, they represent a trifecta of opportunity for savvy investors. Don’t wait until the next bull run to act. Secure your share of $TICS before the presale price increases this weekend, and watch your portfolio soar alongside blockchain’s evolution. Don’t miss out—prices rise this weekend!

Expanding Payment Options Coinbase may integrate other popular payment platforms, such as Google Pay or Samsung Pay, to further diversify its offerings. 2. Enhanced DeFi Compatibility As DeFi continues to grow, Coinbase’s Onramp platform could play a vital role in onboarding users into decentralized ecosystems. 3. Driving Mainstream Adoption By integrating mainstream payment methods, Coinbase positions itself as a bridge between traditional finance and crypto, supporting the long-term growth of the industry. Conclusion: A Step Forward for Crypto Accessibility Coinbase’s decision to add Apple Pay support to its Onramp platform represents a significant leap in making cryptocurrencies accessible to a broader audience. By streamlining fiat-to-crypto transactions, this integration not only lowers entry barriers but also strengthens Coinbase’s position as a leader in the crypto space. As more traditional payment systems enter the crypto ecosystem, innovations like this will shape the future of digital asset adoption.

Here's Why!,"Chainlink’s native token LINK surged 29% on Dec. 3 as supporters positioned it as the true “bank money,” drawing comparisons to XRP. Chainlink’s LINK Token Soars 29% and Is Dubbed Real ‘Bank Money’ by the Community This surge took LINK from $16.54 a week ago to $26.90, a 53% gain in seven days. The rally follows a number of developments in Chainlink’s ecosystem and renewed discussions in the crypto community regarding LINK’s role in connecting blockchain networks to traditional financial systems. LINK’s rise coincided with a notable rally by XRP, which climbed to $2.46 before recently pulling back. XRP’s rally comes as investors await regulatory clarity and progress on Ripple’s stablecoin and central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiatives. But some Chainlink advocates argue that LINK’s partnerships with major financial institutions make it a real contender for the title of “bank money.” Researcher and Kamino Finance advisor Aylo suggested that XRP’s recent rally could help shed light on Chainlink’s growing presence in traditional finance. Chainlink supporter Zach Rynes, known as ChainLinkGod on X, claimed that LINK is the real “bank money” due to Chainlink’s collaborations with global financial institutions. He emphasized the project’s integration with major banks, saying: “All of this and more is not speculation or wishful thinking, but actual work that Chainlink does with financial institutions, as described by the banks themselves.” In response, Rynes dismissed XRP as a “banker-themed memecoin” that failed to gain meaningful adoption for cross-border payments. He argued that stablecoins and CBDCs have made bridge currencies like XRP obsolete, which is why Ripple is turning to stablecoins and custodial services. *This is not investment advice.

Dogwifhat (WIF): A Rising Dog-Themed Meme Coin on the Solana Blockchain Dogwifhat (WIF) is a new meme coin on the Solana blockchain, inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme. It is gaining popularity for its dog theme and community-driven nature. Meme coins like WIF often originate from internet memes or pop culture, focusing on creating a fun and engaged community. On the Solana blockchain, WIF benefits from fast transactions and low fees. Its potential lies in its ability to attract a large community and possibly appreciate in value as more people adopt it. In the current market cycle, dog-themed meme coins are drawing attention, and WIF could be considered attractive for those interested in this niche of the crypto market. Dogecoin: From Meme to Major Cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) was launched in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies, featuring a Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Designed to be abundant, it has no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. Initially seen as a ""memecoin,"" Dogecoin's value surged in 2021, entering the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and exceeding $50 billion in total value. This rise was driven by social media influence, especially from Elon Musk, and a booming crypto market. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer as a joke, Dogecoin has shown the power of community and social media in influencing financial markets. Its potential lies in its strong community and mainstream recognition, making it an interesting option in the current market cycle. PEPE: Deflationary Memecoin Inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a deflationary memecoin on Ethereum, inspired by Pepe the Frog. It aims to emulate the success of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. With no transaction tax and lacking utility, PEPE maintains a pure memecoin identity. It peaked with a market cap of $1.6 billion in mid-2023, sparking a memecoin frenzy and vibrant community. Its roadmap focuses on increasing visibility through social media and exchange listings. A burning mechanism enhances scarcity, and long-term holders are rewarded. As an ERC-20 token, it benefits from Ethereum's security. Available on platforms like Uniswap, Binance, and KuCoin, PEPE's strong community and deflationary features may appeal to enthusiasts in the current market cycle. BONK: Solana's Shiba Inu Memecoin Empowering the Community BONK is a memecoin on the Solana blockchain featuring a Shiba Inu mascot. It aims to empower the Solana community by redistributing power from venture capital tokens. After a Coinbase listing, its value surged over 100%. BONK serves as a community coin, with 50% of its supply airdropped to Solana's NFT and DeFi participants. By mid-December 2023, BONK had become the third-largest memecoin by market cap, showing a year-to-date increase of over 10,000%. Its integration into the growing Solana ecosystem, including the launch of BonkSwap, a decentralized exchange, indicates significant potential. In the current market cycle, BONK appears attractive due to its community focus and rapid growth. Conclusion Amid the 2024 bull run, WIF, DOGE, PEPE, and BONK show less short-term potential. DOGEN, however, stands out for those seeking luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by presale's end, with potential massive returns, it follows tokens like BONK and WIF. DOGEN builds a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks to early adopters.

37178354,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=103677,1733228334,"Here are 3 Reasons XRP Is Rising, Ripple CEO Shares His View","Amidst the XRP price explosion, analysis has identified the three likely factors spurring the asset's recent surge to multi-year highs. XRP has recently become one of the brightest crypto assets, drawing attention from market spectators and speculators alike. For context, the asset has surged over 400% in the past month, surpassing its price peak in the last cycle.Amidst the surging traction, questions about the asset’s driving force have emerged. With investors growing increasingly curious about what is behind the recent XRP face-melting price upsurge, here are three substantial reasons.Gensler’s ResignationThe XRP Ledger (XRPL) native token has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the planned resignation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Gary Gensler. For context, XRP broke past a three-year price high of $1.40 after the unpopular regulator’s boss announced he would leave office in January 2025.After XRP trumped Solana and USDT to become the third-largest cryptocurrency , Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse shared his thoughts on the remarkable achievement. In a tweet, Garlinghouse tied the XRP’s recent form discovery to Gensler’s resignation, noting that “after Gensler, all boats rise.”https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1863587414331006998Ripple’s CLO Stuart Alderoty also shared the same narrative. After XRP’s push past the $150 billion market cap, he mentioned that it seems the SEC has been the sole proprietor of the prolonged price suppression seen in the crypto market.Koreans Steering XRP’s ExplosionMeanwhile, data shows a chunk of XRP’s trading volume since it resumed its bullish upsurge has come from South Korea. On-chain analytical firm Scopescan indicated that Upbit played a crucial role in the XRP price uptick, as a considerable amount of the asset’s liquidity came from the exchange.Per Scopescan’s analysis, the 24-hour trading volume on Upbit’s XRP/KRW spot pair surged to $3.8 billion, accounting for almost 30% of the exchange’s total volume. Notably, this staggering trading activity on XRP was 11 times that of Bitcoin and also beats the XRP volume on Binance, the largest crypto exchange by volume.Furthermore, Bithumb, another South Korean exchange, also saw a similar trend. On Bithumb, XRP’s trading volume surged to $1.12 billion, accounting for 32% of its total volume. XRP Trading Volume Per Exchange Meanwhile, other exchanges also saw increased trading traction towards the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. For instance, XRP’s trading volume on Coinbase accounted for 22.29% of the exchange’s 24-hour volume, beating that of Bitcoin by three and a half times.Massive Accumulation from CoinbaseCryptoQuant’s CEO Ki Young Ju also shared another propellant of the XRP price surge. He tweeted that XRP whale accumulation on Coinbase was a major driving force in the latest rally.Young Ju argued that in the past 30 days, the Coinbase XRP Premium—an indicator of buying pressure on an exchange—has ranged between 3% and 13%. Meanwhile, Upbit's premium has remained almost insignificant, indicating that most of the XRP accumulation spree came from Coinbase. XRP PremiumIn the meantime, XRP trades at $2.62, up 8% in the past 24 hours.",POSITIVE,XRP,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/03/here-are-3-reasons-xrp-is-rising-ripple-ceo-shares-his-view/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=here-are-3-reasons-xrp-is-rising-ripple-ceo-shares-his-view,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

XRP: A Fast, Low-Cost Cryptocurrency for Borderless Transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency supported by the XRP Ledger, designed for fast, low-cost, and borderless transactions. Operating on a decentralized network without a central authority, it provides secure and irreversible transactions without needing a bank account. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with 100 billion coins, with 80 billion gifted to Ripple to support development. Ripple uses XRP to enhance network liquidity and has placed 55 billion XRP in escrow for controlled release. The potential of XRP lies in revolutionizing cross-border payments. Its attractiveness in the current market depends on adoption, regulatory developments, and market conditions. VeChain (VET): Blockchain Enhancing Supply Chain Transparency VeChain (VET) is a blockchain platform focused on improving supply chain management. It uses smart contracts to track products in industries like food, fashion, and automotive. Each product gets a unique ID and sensor, allowing companies to monitor goods through the supply chain. This helps verify authenticity and manage recalls. VeChain has its own blockchain called VeChainThor and uses two tokens: VET for value transfer and VTHO for transaction fees. Founded by Sunny Lu in 2015, VeChain partners with firms like Walmart China and BMW. These factors highlight its potential. In the current market, its adoption suggests it continues to play an important role. Algorand (ALGO): A Scalable Platform for Decentralized Applications Algorand, launched in 2019, improves cryptocurrency usability by enhancing transaction speeds and finalization times. It diverges from traditional designs by rewarding ALGO holders with new currency for each block. The platform supports smart contracts and token creation for both new and existing assets, attracting venture investors. Algorand aims to be a preferred platform for developing decentralized applications, appealing to investors who favor proof-of-stake blockchains for lower operational costs. The Algorand Foundation oversees the protocol, with a cap of 10 billion ALGO units and a detailed 5-year distribution plan. In the current market cycle, Algorand's scalability and efficiency make it an attractive option for developers and investors alike. Conclusion Although XRP, VET, and ALGO have limited short-term potential, Catzilla stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming to bring financial freedom to everyone. Offering up to 700% ROI during its presale, its token price rises from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages.

37171398,https://crypto.news/?p=14315744,1733228100,"Now could be the best time to buy DOGE, XRP and new trending altcoin","Disclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page. Users must do their own research before taking any actions related to the company. Analysts highlight Dogecoin, XRP, and Yeti Ouro as top picks, with XRP soaring, DOGE poised for a breakout, and YETIO offering presale discounts for early investors. Table of Contents The XRP show continues; Is DOGE next? Investors flock to Yeti Ouro Amid a slight pullback to start the week, analysts believe that it could be the best time to invest in Dogecoin, XRP and the new DeFi altcoin Yeti Ouro (YETIO). Dogecoin has had an unimpressive weekly showing and can now be acquired at a slight discount, while XRP has been one of the best performers in that time and is likely to continue soaring. Yeti Ouro is in its first presale stage, where it’s going for a discounted price as well, making it the best time to get in before it explodes. The XRP show continues; Is DOGE next? It has undoubtedly been XRP’s bull rally. The token has quadrupled its value since the start of November as it repays investors who have stuck with it during the trying times. XRP price started the week with a 20% rise in just 24 hours. This was even more impressive given it was against the tide, as seven of the other top cryptos were in the red, with Solana leading the dip at 6%. This brought the total gains over the past seven days to 50% for XRP. Ripple’s XRP price hit a peak of $2.5 on Sunday night, its highest in six years and ten months. The last time XRP was at this level was in mid-January, 2018, during the bull rally, where it set its all-time high at $3.84. At $2.5, XRP’s market cap was a staggering $141.5 billion, which flipped Tether to become the third-largest crypto after Bitcoin and Ethereum. At that market cap, it was more valuable than Japan’s largest bank, MUFG, and American banking giant Citibank. XRP has since dipped slightly, allowing Tether to reclaim its position. However, its unfazed momentum in the November bull rally indicates that it’s only a matter of time before it cements its claim to the third position, which it held for years before the SEC came in with its bogus lawsuit and obliterated the token’s market. As XRP soars, Dogecoin has been a mixed bag. It was among the first to surge after the November 5th elections, but since then, it has been trading sideways on most days. In the past week, it has dipped over 5% and is struggling to maintain its price above $0.4093. The memecoin’s sideways trading has allowed it to consolidate over the past week, which precedes a major upward breakout. It has struggled to rise past the critical resistance level of $0.43, but once it does, it will surge toward the key psychological level of $1. Investors flock to Yeti Ouro Investors are also flocking to Yeti Ouro, a new DeFi altcoin that they believe will yield greater returns than XRP and DOGE. Yeti Ouro’s ongoing presale has attracted thousands of investors who have purchased over 70 million YETIO tokens, raising $842,000 for the project. Yeti Ouro is focused on offering utility through its native YETIO token, setting it apart from most meme coins today which rely purely on speculation. The token powers its Yeti Go play-to-earn racing game, where players pay race entry fees and receive rewards for winning races in YETIO. They can also purchase weapons and customizations in YETIO and stake the tokens to unlock exclusive rewards.

Sui (SUI) Sui (SUI) has been making waves with its fluctuating price. In the past week, the price has dipped by 3.08%. Yet, looking at the bigger picture, there's a notable 65.69% surge over the past month and an impressive 212.28% increase in six months. Currently, SUI trades between $3.08 and $3.77, highlighting its volatility and the market's active interest. Technical indicators present a mixed outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 44.32, suggesting that SUI is neither overbought nor oversold. The Stochastic value is 25.30, edging closer to oversold territory, which might indicate a potential upward correction. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is slightly negative at -0.0526, pointing to mild bearish momentum. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $3.26, slightly below the 100-day average of $3.43, signaling caution among traders. Key price levels to watch are the nearest resistance at $4.05 and support at $2.69. A move above the resistance could propel SUI toward the second resistance level at $4.73, offering substantial gains. On the downside, slipping below the support might lead to a drop toward the second support at $2.01. Considering the significant growth in recent months, traders are keenly observing these levels to determine SUI's next direction. Pepe (PEPE) Pepe (PEPE) has been making waves in the crypto market. Over the past week, its price has seen a modest increase of 1.28%. However, the real story emerges when looking at the past month, where PEPE has skyrocketed by 130.26%. Over six months, the coin has grown by 42.46%. These numbers highlight a strong upward trend that has caught the attention of many investors. Currently, PEPE is trading between $0.00001862 and $0.00002462. The nearest resistance level is at $0.00002698, and breaking through this could push the price toward the second resistance at $0.00003298. On the flip side, the nearest support is at $0.00001496. If the price dips below this, it might fall to the next support level of $0.000008962. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 42.01, indicating that the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.0000003786, suggesting a possible shift in momentum. Given the recent surge, there's potential for PEPE to continue climbing. Surpassing the nearest resistance could result in gains of around 10% or more. The low stochastic value of 18.13 hints that the coin may be oversold, which could lead to a rebound. Traders are also watching the simple moving averages—10-day at $0.00002037 and 100-day at $0.00002063—for signs of a continued uptrend. Whether PEPE will rise or fall remains to be seen, but the data points to an interesting road ahead. Aptos (APT) Aptos (APT) has shown remarkable growth recently. In the past week, its price rose by 3.61%. Over the last month, the coin surged by 44.85%, reflecting strong market momentum. Even over six months, APT gained 41.68%, indicating sustained investor interest. Currently trading between $11.62 and $14.62, Aptos is near its resistance level at $15.77. Surpassing this point could lead to the next resistance at $18.76, offering potential gains of about 28% from current levels. Conversely, the nearest support is at $9.78, roughly 16% below the current price floor. A fall to the second support at $6.79 would be a significant drop, so these levels are crucial for traders to watch. Technical indicators suggest consolidation. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is neutral at 48.74. The MACD is slightly negative at -0.1833, and the Stochastic oscillator is at 35.33, pointing to possible sideways movement. With the 10-day and 100-day moving averages at $12.77 and $13.08, Aptos is hovering near these averages. These factors indicate that the price could either break past resistance levels or test support levels, making this a pivotal moment for APT. Conclusion While SUI, PEPE, and APT are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ) unites sports fans in a memecoin aiming for massive growth and community-driven success—a little better.

Experts Suggest These 5 ADA Alternatives Could Do It First!,"Following XRP's impressive surge, speculation mounts over Cardano's potential to reach new price heights. While optimism surrounds ADA, experts suggest several emerging cryptocurrencies might outpace it, capturing the interest of investors during this bullish market phase. Among these contenders is XYZVerse, a memecoin uniting sports fans across disciplines. By blending meme culture with athletic enthusiasm, it aims to achieve remarkable growth that could surpass established tokens like Cardano. Trump's Victory Sparks Crypto Chaos: $XYZ Meme Coin Ready to Deliver a 99,900% Knockout Donald Trump’s election victory has triggered a seismic shift in the crypto market, setting the stage for a bull run like no other. As the dust settles, major coins limp forward with uninspiring double-digit gains, while meme coins are stealing the show. PNUT’s recent 4,500% surge? FRED’s 6,000% explosion? Ancient history, buried in the ashes of short-lived hype. These coins buckled under selling pressure, leaving FOMO-ridden investors licking their wounds. But the crypto battlefield doesn’t wait for the weak — a new titan has emerged with plans to obliterate profit records and deliver an earth-shaking 99,900% surge. Take the XYZ Side - The Undisputed Champion of Meme Coins $XYZ Breaks into the Ring to Knockout Meme Coin Legends Meet $XYZ - the first-ever all-sports memecoins for true crypto degens hungry for 1000X profits. This is the token for those who thrive on the thrill of competition. As Trump takes the reins, the crypto market is set to erupt so the competition is getting fierce. Only the strongest tokens can survive in this no-mercy arena. Here comes the dawn of a crypto era for those with balls of steel — the guys like Joe Rogan and Dana White — who’d proudly rally behind Trump’s team. With such true men of business on board, there is no place for old pussy meme coins, it's time for real brutal coins. Fueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors and rocket to the moon on Elon Musk’s mission. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price: $0.0001 Price Now: $0.000667 In just a couple of months, $XYZ already soared over 550%!

The $XYZ presale is already smashing through stages with the speed of a champion’s knockout blow. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Ondo (ONDO) Ondo (ONDO) has experienced significant movement recently. In the past week, its price jumped by 18.11%. Over the month, the increase is even more impressive at 88.41%. However, looking back six months, the coin is down by 13.01%, showing some long-term volatility. Currently trading between $1.05 and $1.40, Ondo is approaching its nearest resistance level at $1.53. If it breaks through this point, the next target is the second resistance at $1.88. On the downside, the nearest support level sits at $0.83, with a deeper support at $0.47 if the price dips further. Technical indicators suggest mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 57.59, and the Stochastic oscillator reads 62.78, both hovering in neutral territory. The Simple Moving Averages over 10 and 100 days are close, at $1.20 and $1.19 respectively, indicating a consolidation phase. However, the MACD level is slightly negative at -0.00693, hinting at possible bearish momentum. Based on this data, Ondo's price could rise if it surpasses the $1.53 resistance, but failure to do so might lead to a decline toward the $0.83 support. NEAR Protocol (NEAR) NEAR has experienced significant price movements recently. Over the past week, its price saw a slight drop of -0.9182%, settling within a range of $6.17 to $7.46. In contrast, the past month showed a strong surge of 73.71%, indicating bullish momentum. However, looking at the last six months, NEAR's price decreased by -8.25%, reflecting some long-term volatility. Technical indicators provide mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 51.29, suggesting a neutral market sentiment. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is at -0.0731, hinting at potential bearish trends. NEAR's 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are $6.67 and $6.89 respectively, showing the current price is hovering around these averages. Looking ahead, NEAR faces a resistance level at $8.01. If it breaks through, the next target could be $9.30, which would be an increase of around 24% from the current upper range. On the downside, the nearest support is at $5.42. Falling below this could lead to the second support at $4.12, a decrease of about 33% from the current lower range. These levels may play a crucial role in NEAR's upcoming price direction. Sui (SUI) Sui (SUI) has been making waves with its fluctuating price. In the past week, the price has dipped by 3.08%. Yet, looking at the bigger picture, there's a notable 65.69% surge over the past month and an impressive 212.28% increase in six months. Currently, SUI trades between $3.08 and $3.77, highlighting its volatility and the market's active interest. Technical indicators present a mixed outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 44.32, suggesting that SUI is neither overbought nor oversold. The Stochastic value is 25.30, edging closer to oversold territory, which might indicate a potential upward correction. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is slightly negative at -0.0526, pointing to mild bearish momentum. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $3.26, slightly below the 100-day average of $3.43, signaling caution among traders. Key price levels to watch are the nearest resistance at $4.05 and support at $2.69. A move above the resistance could propel SUI toward the second resistance level at $4.73, offering substantial gains. On the downside, slipping below the support might lead to a drop toward the second support at $2.01. Considering the significant growth in recent months, traders are keenly observing these levels to determine SUI's next direction. Toncoin (TON) Toncoin (TON) has been gaining attention with its recent price movements. In the past week, its price increased by 8.05%. Over the last month, it surged by 35.78%. However, over the past six months, the price dipped by 9.29%, showing some volatility in the longer term. Currently, TON is trading between $6.01 and $7.33. The nearest resistance level is $7.82. If the price breaks through this point, it could aim for the second resistance at $9.14. On the downside, the nearest support level is $5.18, with a second support at $3.86. Technical indicators provide mixed signals. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close, at $6.54 and $6.61 respectively, suggesting steady movement. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 49.40, close to neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The stochastic value is 37.89, which is somewhat low and might suggest potential for a rise. However, the MACD level is negative at -0.0718, pointing to some bearish momentum. Considering these factors, TON might continue its upward trend in the short term, testing resistance levels if positive momentum continues. Conclusion ONDO, NEAR, SUI, and TON offer potential, but XYZVerse (XYZ) combines sports and memes, aiming for massive growth that could surpass them all.

37171142,https://crypto.news/?p=14315601,1733227260,What DePIN got wrong and how to fix it | Opinion,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. An unhealthy fixation on native tokens, coupled with hardware installed in areas with low demand, means far too many DePIN projects lack sustainability. Decentralized physical infrastructure networks —otherwise known as DePINs for short—are ambitious projects that represent a huge undertaking. They involve so much more than launching a flash-in-the-pan memecoin in a couple of clicks. You might also like: Unlocking the power of community: DePINs are shaping a new economy | Opinion The goal of connecting real-world assets, such as energy grids and transport networks, to blockchains is one that takes time, resources, and scale. Because of this, it’s little wonder that The Block Research suggests funding has now hit a new all-time high of $1.91 billion. Deepening interest in artificial intelligence has given the burgeoning DePIN sector another boost—but not all projects are born equal, and those that survive in this competitive landscape need to overcome sizable structural issues to reach their full potential. Transfixed on tokens One particular issue relates to the mistaken notion that startups need to launch a native token to be successful. This can be a fatal error, as it means the value of a network is tied to the wider market and macroeconomic events that are completely out of its control. Helium ( HNT ) is a good example of what this looks like in practice. This blockchain-based platform was created with the vision of cultivating a people-powered wireless internet network, meaning those who operate hotspots would be rewarded with HNT tokens. But in reality, the project’s success lay in how this digital asset launched at an opportune time—right in the middle of a huge bull run that generated FOMO among investors. Huge rises in this token’s value weren’t a reflection of this network’s resilience or how many clients it had. This essentially stripped HNT back to a mere memecoin with little utility. In fact, when you look at Helium’s annual recurring revenue, a sobering statistic emerges. Even with $1 billion worth of hardware, it would take the Internet of Things close to 1,000 years to break even. Other contenders in the space include peaq, a network that says it’s home to more than 50 DePINs. Healthy scrutiny is needed here, as it’s difficult for most blockchains to handle the transaction volumes of a single decentralized physical infrastructure network, let alone 50. And that brings us to the biggest lesson that up-and-coming DePIN brands need to learn: you don’t need a token of your own as long as rewards for users are liquid. We’ve already seen how such digital assets can even land projects in hot water, with Pollen Mobile facing lawsuits in the US after being accused of “minting coins from thin air” and flogging them for cash. DePIN delivers one of the poorest returns on capital employed across any industry on Earth—and its decentralized nature means that the financial burden is passed on to those who invest in a project rather than the founders. And for this sector to really make an impact, founders should be focusing on creating demand-driven solutions, shifting their efforts to attracting more clients rather than making their networks bigger. Let’s explain what this means in practice. Instead of adopting a “build it and they will come” model, a demand-driven approach would mean hotspots pop up in the areas where there are already paying customers who want them. India is a prime example of a market where there’s an insatiable demand for internet connectivity, but 600 million people lack access. By severing ownership from installation, a DePIN investor could purchase hardware that it is then put to use where it is actually needed—in some cases halfway around the world. Rethinking DePINs Of course, hardware is a crucial element when creating DePINs—but right now, the incentives are misaligned. Too many projects have sold equipment at inflated prices, all while becoming reliant on shifting more units to bolster their revenues. Others have allocated a share of each purchase to token burning in an attempt to make these digital assets more palatable. While this may inflate their price in the short run, it means such cryptocurrencies violate the Howey Test , which determines whether an asset is a security. Worse still, it often means that investors enter a project for all the wrong reasons—putting financial interest first instead of benefiting others. The “build it and they will come” method creates an environment where DePIN hardware lies gathering dust and unused, but aggrieved investors continue to demand a return. But generous payouts can prove unsustainable, creating high levels of apathy when rewards dwindle. Insisting on distributing compensation in the form of a volatile native token can also be exceptionally off putting to corporations, who would prefer to be paid using digital dollars instead. Going demand first means that a native token’s value is of secondary concern, and the focus can rightly return to ensuring that a DePIN does the most good. The first step is to find consumers who would benefit from this infrastructure and then ensure that hardware funded by investors goes to those who reach them. This helps generate actual revenue and means a network grows organically. When it comes to rewards, distributing revenue in the form of stablecoins can make income streams far more transparent and predictable than they are today. In the old-fashioned world of infrastructure, careful planning and research are performed before a single dollar of capital is spent. Feasibility studies examine whether an ambitious project is achievable, who it would serve, and where they are based. DePINs should follow the same approach—and put end-users at the heart of their strategy. Blockchain technology and spreading funding costs across a broader cross-section of people can be truly transformative—enabling emerging markets to finally access the technology they need to grow their economies and become more prosperous. But the DePIN projects trying to make this happen need to realize that throwing a native token into the bargain for the sake of it risks creating an unnecessary distraction that could ultimately prove harmful in the long run—and spark no end of legal and regulatory headaches. Sustainability is the name of the game here. Too much supply and too little demand will always spell disaster. But putting demand first and incrementally increasing supply along the way is a recipe for success—and should serve as the roadmap for helping the DePIN sector thrive and change the world.

42415958,b641d1ad-5c47-4bd3-b876-312f5d77e5ff,1733227223,It's Raining Options and BTC Doesn't Care: Crypto Daybook Americas,"By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)  It's literally raining BTC options! OK, not literally, but just two weeks after call and put contracts for BlackRock's spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) began trading, we now have Cboe cash-settled FLEX options on both the Cboe Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index and the Cboe Mini Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index.  These options debuted without much fanfare on Monday and have opened up a new ""defined outcome"" market, according to Jeff Park, the head of alpha strategies at Bitwise. Park says they allow for the customization of over-the-counter strategies while completely cutting out counterparty risk. That paves the way for innovative strategies focused on principal protection and range accrual at a time when giant companies like Microsoft might be contemplating a BTC investment.   But here's the dampener: BTC isn’t really responding to all the excitement. The largest cryptocurrency is trading flat near $95,000 and testing the patience of bulls who are itching for that landmark break above $100K. The lackluster response could be a sign of market exhaustion, especially given whispers the U.S. government possibly moving to liquidate its holdings.  The dollar index (DXY) is a bit tentative too, with traders holding fire till they see Tuesday's U.S. JOLTS job report. Expectations are that vacancies rose to 7.48 million in November from the previous 7.44 million, per FXStreet. A hotter-than-expected number could lift the dollar, lead to reduced bets on a Fed interest-rate cut and put pressure on BTC.  Looking at the wider crypto market, major tokens like ETH are mostly calm, though XRP and ADA are still riding a wave thanks to retail investor enthusiasm. Money is also being rotated into darlings of the previous bull run like LINK, which has gained 24% in the past 24 hours. Even litecoin (LTC) is rising. One thing to note — XRP’s wild price spikes have a history of marking major BTC and crypto market tops, as we'll see in our TA section down below.  There are rumors flying around that Solana is about to announce something big related to airdrops. According to Fox journalist Eleanor Terrett, President-elect Donald Trump might announce a replacement for the outgoing SEC-chair Gary Gensler's as early as Tuesday.  Now for something jaw-dropping: Yield farming on Avalanche-based TraderJoe is heating up with the most traded pair, AVAX/USDC, offering a 24-hour APR of over 1,000%. Can you believe it?  Investor demand for stablecoins is going through the roof. Late Monday, annualized deposit rates for USDT and USDC shot up to nearly 30%, while USDe spiked as high as 60% on AAVE.

CHAOS was automatically deployed by another AI agent based on @aixbt_agent's X posts, with the market cap reaching over $17 million within an hour. The bot (or its operators) have since tried to distance it from the token, but its official wallet has already received upward of $100,000 in fees as a share of the total fees earned by floating CHAOS on decentralized exchanges.  Derivatives Positioning  BTC's implied volatility term structure remains in contango, but front-end puts are again trading at a premium to calls, reflecting concern the price is about to drop.   ETH's term structure is in backwardation, with the front end at an annualized 71% versus the back end at 68%. That's a sign traders are preparing for increased turbulence in the next few weeks.   Options flows have been mixed, with put spreads lifted alongside notable bullish activity in the BTC Dec. 27 expiry call at the $180,000 strike.   In the past seven days, several tokens have increased in price alongside an uptick in perpetual futures open interest. At the same time, they have seen a decline in the cumulative volume delta (CVD), implying a net selling pressure.

Despite recent growth, the uncertainties surrounding Coinbase's business model and the crypto market make it a risky investment with only a 25% chance of exceeding its current stock price. Favorable regulation and increased institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies are critical for Coinbase's long-term value, but these factors are already priced in. Given the high level of uncertainty and the need for more stable revenue, I recommend holding on to the stock rather than investing now. Overview Coinbase ( COIN ) is a blockchain company. As based on a nascent technology, it is uncertain but promising. After Election Day, bitcoin securities have risen wildly, foreseeing looser regulation from the Trump administration (Figure 1). Coinbase is one of the beneficiaries, and I estimate that the run-up will keep in the coming weeks. Figure 1: Seeking Alpha Despite this, I do not recommend investing in the company now due to the uncertainties surrounding it. In my base case, I estimate a value near its current stock price, but incorporating the risk, I estimate a 25% probability of having a value greater than its current stock price. Its revenue fluctuated from a low $590 million in 2022Q3 to a high $1,450 million in 2024Q1. From this high, it decreased to $1,129 million in the last quarter. Free cash flows fluctuated wilder and went from -3,059 million in 2022Q2 to $3,219 million a couple of quarters later (Figure 2). It is hard to value a company with such uncertainty. Either way, I will estimate its value, assigning probabilities to the most significant uncertainties. But first, I will identify what must happen to stabilize its business model: 1) The source of revenue must be more stable; 2) Bitcoin must eliminate its speculative nature and have an economic reality; it must be useful; and 3) regulatory barriers must be cleared away. Figure 2: Author Aiming for more stable revenue streams and economic reality for crypto Revenue is highly volatile due to crypto trading. Diversifying to a more stable revenue stream is critical for me to assign a better risk-return ratio for the company. The company is working on this diversification, but I think they are not at a comfortable point. Transaction revenue grew 98% year over year in the last quarter to $572 million, higher than subscription and service revenue, the more stable stream, which grew 66% to $556 million. So, those stable revenue streams were 49% of total revenue a year ago and now 46%. One of the revenue streams not linked to speculation is revenue from stablecoin. Its revenue has increased by 43% to $246 million. Stablecoin grows thanks to higher on-platform USDC balances, which is good news for the company. As more institutional entities trade USDC, they are using cryptocurrencies to make real-world transactions based on the real economy, which means the crypto utility is higher. Even with transaction revenue, I prefer that those transactions be from institutional players rather than consumers. Institutional entities mean two things to me. Firstly, they derive a more stable flow of transactions, and secondly, they provide credibility to cryptocurrency transactions since they are used by professionals. However, this trend—fees from stablecoin—gives more certainty to Coinbase's cash flow but makes monetizing more challenging. Coinbase charges 0.3% for cryptocurrency transactions but 0.15% for USDC conversion to USD . Besides, clients that hold $500 million assets or higher are exempt from any fee. So, institutional clients who have grown so much are paying less for the services. Sales and marketing costs have increased 110% to $165 million, from 12% of revenue to 14%, a clear sign that the company is making less for the same effort to acquire and retain customers. The Base service launched a year ago is another promising revenue stream that can create stable inflows for the company. Base is a software layer over the blockchain Ethereum network. Coinbase develops this layer and allows developers to code applications that can use Ethereum. Base is classified as Other Revenue that has grown from $51 million in 2023Q3 to $77 million in 2024Q3. It is just $26 million that doesn't move the needle yet. It is something that I will be watching closely, but it isn't meaningful now. Besides generating more stable revenue, with Base, the company tries to de-intermediate crypto networks to create proprietary networks, trying to capture the associated network effects. Regulation When investing in a company like Coinbase, it is critical that the regulations align with the industry's interests. Regulations must get looser. Crypto supporters demand that the industry not be regulated as a financial company. They claim that those strict regulations are contrary to innovation and will prevent the industry from growing and raising the needed funds. Under Trump, agencies like the SEC may reduce pressure to enforce actions against crypto firms. Regulation could shift from controlling crypto companies to protecting consumers from fraud. It may even promote self-regulation within the industry rather than heavy federal oversight. The House has passed the FIT 21 bill, a pro-crypto regulation bill supported by both parties. With the new Senate, the way is cleared. Figure 3: Seeking Alpha Even though Trump's Administration supports crypto regulation, as the market has demonstrated since election day, nothing is for granted. Coinbase allocated $25 million to Fairshake for pro-crypto advocacy ahead of the U.S. midterms. They will continue to support StandWithCrypto.org . I think the regulatory issue is one of the most certain of the three critical drivers of Coinbase's value. However, I think it is already priced in, as Figure 3 shows. Valuation Figure 4 shows the company's value drivers, considering a year as the last four quarters to capture the latest information. Regarding margins, I utilize a measure I call Cash Margin, which involves adjusting net income for non-cash items such as amortization and depreciation, stock-based compensation, and deferred income tax. Figure 4: Author As outlined throughout the article, there is too much uncertainty in the company and the industry. In this section, I will define a case based on what I estimate would be a plausible scenario. Later, in the risk section, I will quantify my uncertainties to grasp the probability of the value estimate being higher than the current stock price. My base case scenario is based on Figure 5. I expect revenue growth for the next year to be 45%. Later on, the growth rate will decrease to 17%. So, I believe the company will grow like a tech company in these ten years. The scenario is optimistic and assumes regulations will be favorable, the company will innovate, and it will be easier to get funding. The Cash Margin will be 30% during the period. This is the average for the last three years. It is quite uncertain because the company must expand its client base, and we don't know if it will be difficult. We have seen that the percentage over revenue has increased in the last 12 trailing months. On the contrary, a more favorable regulation will make it easier to gain customers. I am confident margins will be around 30%. Net working capital has fluctuated from -59% to 126%. I assume that it will converge to zero accumulated over the next ten years. Cash flows will be discounted at a 14.0% WACC because the beta is 3.34. The risk-free rate is 4.2%. The company's leverage is 34% of total capital. The perpetual growth rate is set at 3%. Figure 5: Author Figure 5 shows that my value estimate is $324 per share, a 9% premium over its current stock price. It is, in my opinion, a value close to the current stock price with no margin of safety. The implied multiple Price to Free Cash Flow is 51, in line with the current multiple (Figure 6). Figure 6 Risks In this section, I am trying to model the uncertainty in the revenue growth rate and cash margin. It is based on the valuation section scenario, and I will use a triangular probability function. I don't want to define a precise probability function because I have no evidence to support it. In reality, it is like considering multiple scenarios. Revenue growth's likeliest value is 29%, the average base case over the ten years. I believe that the revenue growth rate can be as low as -10%. That is the case where competition from Binance or other network operators leads the market and gets market share from Coinbase. I consider 50% to be the highest revenue growth rate. In this scenario, Coinbase grows at a formidable rate, the industry grows fast, and Coinbase gains market share. The cash margin varies from 20% to 45% and is around 30% of the base case. In the model, this variable has less impact than the revenue growth rate. The revenue growth rate explains 84% of the variation of value, the independent variable, and the cash margin is 16%. The result of the model is shown in Figure 7. It reflects the cumulative probability of the stock value, a sensitivity graph showing the different ranges of stock value based on each of the other growth rates, and a cash margin with the variables I have just described. The conclusion is that the probability of getting a value greater than the current stock price of $296 per share is 25% (the blue area), so the risks I have described will give a lower chance of getting that value. Figure 7: Author My base case has little margin of safety, and when I incorporate the uncertainties, there is only a 25% chance of achieving a value higher than the current stock price. Conclusion There is too much uncertainty in Coinbase and, in general, in any crypto security. I seek to clear this uncertainty by three things: The revenue stream must be more stable. Bitcoin must eliminate its speculative nature and have an economic reality; it must be useful. And third, regulatory barriers must be cleared away. My conclusion is that the company has room to advance on those three fronts. Risks are weighted in my valuation, with just a 25% probability of having a long-term value greater than its current stock price. I recommend holding on to the stock.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4741702-coinbase-crypto-hype-with-still-too-much-uncertainties?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37171039.jpeg

37171093,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/advice-for-those-new-to-bitcoin-and-crypto,1733227000,Advice for those new to Bitcoin and crypto,"Retail is soon going to be waking up to the biggest wealth transfer in history, and the majority of these new traders and investors are going to get stung. Here is some advice if you are one of the newbies to crypto. How to make a start First of all, when entering the world of crypto, you will soon realise that this is a financial playground that is not fully controlled by banks, governments, or Wall Street. At least not yet. Unlike the stock market, you don’t need a broker to make trades for you. You can just set up a wallet, transfer some funds to it (your bank allowing) and then set up an account at a cryptocurrency exchange. There are many of these exchanges, spread across the internet, and based in various jurisdictions that might require some basic KYC (Know Your Customer) details, before you can start trading. Many countries still negative on crypto You do need to bear in mind though that a lot of the exchanges can be problematic depending which country you are based in. For example, would-be traders based in the UK are not allowed to access many crypto exchanges, due to geolocation restraints imposed by the FCA, the country’s regulatory watchdog. It may take a change of government before UK citizens are able to avoid this kind of censorship in the future. When, and if, you are able to sign up to a crypto exchange, and you are then able to see the huge amount of cryptocurrencies on offer, you are perhaps going to be confused as to just what to buy. Beware crypto influencers on social media Warning! If you follow any of the many ‘crypto influencers’ on YouTube and other social networking platforms, you are likely to be presented with all sorts of glittery cryptocurrencies that could make you into a millionaire overnight - or so the influencer would have you believe. What these people don’t say is that very often they are actually paid by the crypto projects that they are extolling the virtues of. The more people they can get to buy this or that cryptocurrency, the more exit liquidity there will be as the influencers themselves, together with the project founders, sell their tokens to the naive retail investors who have been convinced into buying them. Do your research Now, before going any further, it does need to be said that there are valid cryptocurrencies out there that do have some decent fundamentals. For example, Bitcoin has an extremely compelling use case as a store of value, while Ethereum, Solana, and Sui, are other layer-1 blockchains that could be the financial platforms of the future. There are all sorts of cryptocurrencies that seek to disrupt many other niches in the business world, but if you are looking to invest in them, you will need to do a LOT of investigation into their potential. Memecoin mania Many new retail traders are bound to be attracted by the bright lights of the memecoins. Yet again though, this particular niche in the world of cryptocurrencies carries the most extreme warning level possible. To put this into perspective, memecoins have absolutely nothing backing them at all, except faith that they will go up in value as more people jump onto the latest pump to the upside. There is no doubt that you will come across this or that story of traders who made millions by backing one memecoin or another. Yes, this has happened, but how many traders strike it rich here? Not many. Armed with a good knowledge of trading, and probably gained over a period of a few years, there is the possibility that some success could be achieved here. Without this, it is a case of pinning the tail on the donkey. The safe bet is Bitcoin When all is said and done, the good, safe bet, is probably Bitcoin. Yes, there can be wild swings still to the up or downside, and there are bear markets at the end of the normal 4 year cycle, whereby Bitcoin can lose more than half of its value. However, if investing in Bitcoin, your time horizon needs to be at least a few years. It is 100% certain that the purchasing power of your fiat currency will go down over time, and in these worrisome times, this is likely to be at an accelerated rate. Over a long enough time frame, Bitcoin has been proven to increase in value against just about every other asset. Buying and holding it is probably a far less stressful pastime than trading altcoins or memecoins. Think long and hard about this.

Elon’s Billions (ELONBILL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONBILL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Billions can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Billions could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Billions launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Billions on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Billions by entering its contract address – 5VkZGZPArjvA7aDTMVenePmqW62rRZtugUPqC8kEXaez – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONBILL.

Altcoins Lead the Gains","Altcoin gains are topping the charts with massive gains across the board. Ripple (XRP) and Hedera (HBAR) are leading the surge, with 420% and 710% gains, respectively, over the past month. Altcoins continue to dominate the news with their massive gains. Notable projects include Ripple (XRP), which has risen by over 90% in the past week, and Hedera (HBAR), which has surged by 166%. Let’s delve into the latest altcoin gainers, expected to surge further as we near the altcoin season. Ripple (XRP) Market Cap Exceeds $150 Billion Ripple’s XRP has gained massively over the past month and is now the third-largest crypto with a market capitalization exceeding $150 billion. Ripple (XRP) has witnessed a spectacular gain in value after news of Gary Gensler’s planned exit surfaced. Ripple Labs has been embroiled in a highly publicized legal battle with the securities agency for which Ripple paid a hefty price. In 2020, the regulator sued Ripple for its supposed breach of securities laws, resulting in many exchanges, such as Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, and Gemini, choosing to delist XRP. Ripple finally found some relief after a partial victory in 2023 ended the SEC’s 3-year-long crusade against the company. The Southern District of New York Court delivered a partial victory to Ripple in its matter with the SEC after Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s XRP token is “not necessarily a security on its face.” XRP’s price gained over 29% in the past week with a bullish outlook. Ripple received some further bullish news after Chris Giancarlo, former chair of the CFTC, predicted the SEC would drop its case against the company. The price of XRP surged further after WisdomTree filed an S-1 application for a spot XRP ETF. Hedera (HBAR) Gains Over 700% in the 30-Day Charts Hedera (HBAR) is the most widely used, sustainable, enterprise-grade public network for the decentralized economy that allows businesses and individuals to create powerful and robust decentralized applications (dApps). Hedera’s native cryptocurrency, HBAR, powers the network and its services, such as smart contracts and transactions, and it is used to help secure the network. HBAR became a headline act in recent weeks, which resulted in a 700% gain in the past month. The price skyrocketed after traders identified a “golden cross” signal. A golden cross is regarded as a bullish indicator in the crypto market and forms when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average. Cardano (ADA) Gains 18% Cardano (ADA) is another major gainer since Donald Trump’s election victory. On-chain metrics show Cardano’s weekly active addresses elevated since the crypto market rally triggered by Trump’s win on November 6 began. The surge in network usage and whale buying activity has resulted in a bullish outlook for ADA. ADA further surged after the Cardano blockchain developers, the Cardano Foundation, released an updated proposal for the Cardano Constitution to improve network governance. The revised proposal includes changes to constitutional workshops, social media discussion, and expert and community feedback. The changes aim to “improve the accessibility and clarity of the Cardano governance framework,” shifting its focus to a less technical audience. Interest in Cardano (ADA) surged after its founder, Charles Hoskinson, revealed plans to help shape US crypto policy under Donald Trump’s incoming administration.

Solana-Based Memecoin Husky Inu (HINU) Presale Nears $600K As BTC continues to trade around $95,000 and top altcoins reach new heights, investors must look for well-priced alternative investment opportunities to profit from the bull run, and Husky Inu is precisely that.

37170906,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373200,1733226710,Bitcoin to Maintain Upward Momentum and Break Through $100K If This Happens (Bitfinex),"With December historically a volatile and choppy month for bitcoin (BTC), analysts at the crypto exchange Bitfinex believe the digital asset could experience a short-term pullback; however, a shift in network dynamics could push it above $100,000. According to a weekly report , BTC could maintain upward momentum this month and rally past $100,000 if short-term holder (STH) demand can meet long-term holder (LTH) supply. At the time of writing, BTC was changing hands at $94,800, following a week of consolidation between $90,000 and $98,000. Can STH Demand Meet LTH Supply? Bitcoin long-term holders have begun to capitalize on increased BTC demand in the market to distribute their held supply on a large scale. Heightened BTC demand from institutional investors and the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) market drove the latest rally. The LTH supply recorded a peak in September, and since then, this cohort of market participants has distributed roughly 508,990 BTC. While this figure represents a significant volume, Bitfinex revealed that it is smaller than the 934,000 BTC LTHs spent during the March rally, which led to bitcoin’s high of $73,666. The last eight months saw LTHs re-accumulate after distributing their bitcoins before the halving. However, with the resumption of a redistribution phase among this cohort of investors, STHs have been buying and accumulating rapidly. Per Bitfinex’s analysis, a reduction in the LTH-held supply is expected at this stage of the bull cycle. BTC Needs ETF Inflows And Strong Demand As LTHs continue to take profits, BTC needs positive ETF flows and strong demand from marginal buyers in the short term to maintain upward momentum. This is because the supply entering the Bitcoin market from LTHs has been sustained for the past two weeks, and a weak spot demand would fail to absorb the supply, resulting in a significant price correction. It is worth mentioning that the LTH Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), which measures the profit margin at which this investor cohort is selling their BTC, signals the market is not near the top. In past cycles, this metric has shown LTHs selling at an average profit of 3.5x at market tops; however, at the time of writing, the SOPR average hovered around 2.6x. Also, the final leg of the bull market starts when the STH supply crosses the pre-halving cycle high of 3,282,000 BTC; this figure is currently at 3,252,000 BTC.

Donald Trump May Announce His Highly Anticipated Critical Decision Tomorrow!,"Donald Trump, known for his support for Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies, said he would dismiss SEC Chairman Gary Gensler as soon as he took office, while Gensler announced that he would resign from his position as SEC Chairman on January 20. While people were wondering who Trump would nominate to be SEC chair instead of Gensler following this announcement, a new report came from FOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett. The Fox reporter said sources said Trump will announce a candidate to replace Gary Gensler tomorrow. Who Can Be Nominated for SEC Chair? While there are many names that could replace Gary Gensler, the most prominent candidate is former SEC member Paul Atkins. Other than Paul Atkins, Robinhood Chief Legal Officer Dan Gallagher, Willkie Law Firm Partner Robert Stebbins, and current SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda are among the popular candidates. While there is curiosity about who Trump will nominate to be SEC chairman, the person he nominates will need to be approved by the Senate to head the agency. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler Is Resigning! Gary Gensler has served as the institution’s 33rd president since April 17, 2021. However, he will step down from his position on January 20, 2025. Gensler has increased oversight of the cryptocurrency sector during his tenure, imposing sanctions on many cryptocurrency companies for fraud and securities registration violations. Despite these lawsuits and sanctions, the SEC under Gensler also approved both spot and futures Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. *This is not investment advice.

Fuse , the payments-focused blockchain, announced its strategic partnership with Stargate , a cross-chain asset bridge, to integrate the latter’s functionalities into the Fuse ecosystem. The integration aims to enhance interoperability across the multichain networks on Fuse and its overall liquidity, for more efficient business payments across users. According to the team statement, Fuse will leverage Stargate’s Hydra technology, to deliver seamless, secure and cost-efficient digital asset transfers in its ecosystem. Fuse Network users will be able to transfer native assets cross-chain while accessing Stargate’s unified liquidity pools with instant guaranteed finality. Enhancing Multichain Asset Transfers on Fuse Stargate allows users and DApps to swap 1:1 native assets cross-chain by accessing Stargate’s unified liquidity pools. In addition, users can add liquidity to the platform’s Omnichain protocol and earn stablecoin rewards for every transfer made using Stargate. The partnership with Stargate will open a new channel for Fuse users to enjoy these benefits and more, the statement adds. Fuse Network will be able to expand its ecosystem and offer users a frictionless experience for transferring digital assets across multiple blockchains. Notwithstanding, by utilizing Stargate’s unified liquidity model, Fuse eliminates the need for traditional liquidity pools, supporting a more streamlined and scalable approach to cross-chain transactions. This is in line with Fuse’s mission to provide global, borderless and cost-friendly payment systems to businesses and individuals without facing liquidity hiccups. Leveraging Stargate’s Hydra technology will remove the complexities of transferring liquidity across the Fuse network while enhancing the platform’s scalability, usability, and simplicity in making payments. It also aligns with Fuse’s broader roadmap, which includes significant upgrades such as the Fuse Ember transition to modular architecture and zkEVM compatibility. Cross-chain Bridges Set To Boost Liquidity on Fuse By reducing the challenges of transferring assets, Fuse is set to benefit from added liquidity on its platform. The Hydra technology will allow Fuse users to bridge key digital assets such as USDC, USDT, and WETH from over 20 chains directly onto the Fuse Network. As alluded to, the 1:1 swapping model backs every native asset in locked reserves on Stargate’s core blockchains such as Ethereum, Avalanche, Fantom, and Arbitrum. This ensures users' funds are secure and enhances reliability without relying on dedicated Fuse liquidity pools. Moreover, Hydra’s composable asset model allows users to interact with various decentralized applications on supported blockchains (or the omnichain ecosystem). This expands the innovations on Fuse while enhancing the utility and accessibility of the Fuse Network. The ability to tap into unified liquidity through Stargate’s multi-chain infrastructure eliminates the need for separate liquidity pathways and reduces reliance on incentivized liquidity programs, creating a more efficient system for users and developers. More importantly, the partnership will remove any fees or slippage while transferring assets across Stargate’s core chains to Fuse, allowing users to make high-volume trades and transactions seamlessly. Finally, the integration of Stargate will allow the majority of DeFi liquidity on Fuse to migrate to Stargate-backed assets without the need for additional capital reserves or complex governance decisions.

37172350,https://cryptonews.com/?p=315500,1733226620,German Fintech 21X Gains EU Approval for Tokenization Platform Under DLT Pilot Regime,"German fintech company 21X has received regulatory approval to launch a tokenization platform, becoming one of the first firms authorized to operate blockchain-based trading infrastructure. The approval was granted under the European Union’s DLT Pilot Regime, according to a Tuesday press release . The announcement came following the issuance of a license by Germany’s financial supervisory authority, Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin). 21X Can Offer Regulated Blockchain Trading The license allows 21X to establish a fully regulated blockchain trading and settlement system from its Frankfurt headquarters. The platform is set to offer a range of services, including tokenization, issuance, distribution, listing, and trading of tokenized financial instruments. The company plans to officially launch in the first quarter of 2025. The EU’s DLT Pilot Regime, implemented in March 2023, provides a legal framework for trading and settlement of crypto assets that qualify as financial instruments under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Regulation (MiFID II). This framework facilitates the creation of new market infrastructures, such as DLT multilateral trading facilities and DLT trading and settlement systems. By securing its license, 21X joins an exclusive group of firms shaping the future of blockchain-based finance in Europe. Obtaining the license was a rigorous process for 21X, requiring 18 months of collaboration with BaFin, the German Federal Bank, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), and the European Central Bank (ECB). “This is more than just a license — it’s a revolutionary moment for capital markets,” Max Heinzle, the founder and CEO of 21X, said. “For the first time, institutional and retail investors can trade and settle tokenized securities on a fully regulated, blockchain-based exchange with the same level of trust, security, and compliance as traditional markets.” To develop its blockchain-based trading platform, 21X has partnered with several key players, including Polygon, Apex Group, and SBI Digital Markets. Polygon, a widely used Ethereum-linked blockchain network, is central to the platform’s design. The company cited Polygon’s cost-effective transaction fees, rapid processing speeds, and robust security measures as critical factors for its adoption. According to 21X, the collaboration with Polygon Labs leverages the network’s scalability and security to facilitate onchain trades and settlements. 21X Partners with Chainlink In addition to its work with Polygon, 21X recently announced a strategic partnership with Chainlink, a Web3 services platform. Chainlink’s technology will be integrated as a standard for onchain finance, further enhancing the platform’s capabilities. We're excited to announce Europe’s first tokenized securities trading & settlement system—21X ( @tradeon21x )—is adopting the #Chainlink standard.

37172349,https://cryptonews.com/?p=315482,1733226568,"Bitcoin Price Forecast: Analyst Says Trump’s Policies Could Fast-Track $150,000 BTC – Here’s How","The price of Bitcoin hasn’t budged in the past 24 hours, with BTC sticking to $95,275 on a day when the crypto market as a whole has risen by 1%. BTC is now up by 2% in a week and by 39% in the past month, with the token consolidated at a level just below $100,000. Yet a growing number of traders are rallying around the possibility that incoming crypto-friendly policies could help Bitcoin zoom towards $150,000 next year . Making it to six figures is likely even if Trump doesn’t announce anything specific upon his inauguration, but if any states or even the federal government were to announce BTC reserve policies, the coin could end up surging. Bitcoin Price Forecast: Analyst Says Trump’s Policies Could Fast-Track $150,000 BTC – Here’s How Posting on X, Dennis Porter – the CEO of the non-profit Satoshi Action Fund – declared overnight that ten states will be “introducing ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserves’ legislation” in the near future. I can now officially confirm and announce that 10 states will be introducing ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserves’ legislation here in the great United STATES of America. We are going to win with Bitcoin. We will lead the world. No one will come close. The word will follow our lead. — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) December 3, 2024 In other words, Porter is claiming that ten states are seriously weighing up whether to begin buying Bitcoin as a store of value. However, the manner in which they’re considering such a policy currently varies from one state to another. For example, Pennsylvania’s legislature has actually seen a bill to this effect , whereas representatives from Texas have merely spoken with Porter in recent days. This follows moves from the cryptocurrency industry to sway President-elect Donald Trump into starting a federal Bitcoin reserve. Again, given the massive funds at the disposal of the US federal government, such a move would potentially send BTC skyrocketing. Some industry figures (e.g. Mike Novogratz ) have suggested that the odds of a federal BTC reserve are low, yet if it does happen, it could kickstart an arms race among nations to stockpile the cryptocurrency.

Now is therefore a very exciting time for Bitcoin, which is about to hit a short-term bottom, having struggled over the past couple of days. Source: TradingView Its 30-period average (orange) is just about to fall below the 200-period average (blue), while its RSI has been low for the past few days. This suggests it’s ready to attempt a climb towards $98,000 again, with the coin on course to pass $100,000 by the end of the year. Diversifying into New High-Potential Alts BTC is the closest thing crypto has to a safe bet, yet traders looking to maximise their profits should also consider diversifying into various newer tokens. New small-cap coins can often outperform the market, given that they start from a low base and can surge if they gain new listings. One promising new coin at the moment is Catslap (SLAP), an Ethereum-based token that listed on Uniswap last month.. It’s now up by more than 5,000% from its listing price, according to DEXTools , and is up by over 80% in the past 24 hours. SLAP now boasts around 10,000 holders since listing on November 21, with the coin already having a market cap of $13.6 million. What’s interesting about Catslap is that it’s not simply a no-utility meme token, with the coin also operating in conjunction with its own slap-to-earn mini-game. Users can play this game via Catslap’s official website , where they can tap on or click the screen in order to animate a cat-slap GIF. Slapping our way to the top of hot pairs $SLAP pic.twitter.com/HgCj8npjCV — CatSlap (@CatSlapToken) November 21, 2024 This sounds simple enough, but what incentivizes engagement is the fact that players receive rewards in SLAP. So the more they slap, the more SLAP they receive, with the coin also having a staking mechanism for added rewards. Boosting the bull case for SLAP further is the coin’s burn mechanism, which so far has destroyed around 38.6 million tokens. Investors can either trade it on Uniswap or buy it directly via the Catslap website , where 1 SLAP is approx. $0.00591.

NFT Sectors Faces More Setbacks It is worth noting that the NFT sector has faced numerous setbacks as of late. Last week, crypto exchange Kraken announced the closure of its NFT marketplace after less than a year in operation. “We’ve made the decision to close our NFT marketplace so we can shift more resources into new products and services, such as unannounced initiatives in-development,” a Kraken spokesperson said. “Clients have been informed of the changes and our team will support them as they move their NFTs to their Kraken Wallet or a self-custodial wallet of choice.” More recently, Nike-owned digital fashion and web3 studio RTFKT announced plans to wind down operations. According to an announcement shared on RTFKT’s social media channels, its Web3 services will cease by the end of January 2025. The company cited a transition to preserving its legacy through an updated website showcasing its previous projects. Back in March, Starbucks, the renowned multinational coffee chain, made the decision to terminate its NFT rewards program . In January, gaming retailer GameStop announced the closure of its NFT marketplace after scaling back its crypto services over the past two years.

37170813,https://coinpedia.org/?p=388619,1733226372,Ondo Finance (ONDO) Hit New All-Time High: Should You Buy In Now?,"The post Ondo Finance (ONDO) Hit New All-Time High: Should You Buy In Now? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ondo Finance (ONDO) has surged over 11% today, reaching an all-time high of $1.79. Its daily trading volume has soared to a yearly peak of $994 million, showing a sharp rise in trader interest. Additionally, rising open interest signals more capital entering the market, sparking new buying activity. This explosive rally is drawing attention, fueled by institutional interest, market speculation, and overall optimism in the crypto space. Big Money Moving into ONDO One of the key reasons for ONDO’s rise is significant institutional interest. Crypto influencer Grey BTC recently pointed out that Upbit, a major crypto exchange, has been steadily accumulating ONDO for the past five months. Upbit now holds more ONDO than early investors like Pantera Capital and Coinbase Ventures. This large-scale accumulation signals strong confidence in ONDO’s potential and has fueled what Grey BTC describes as a “clear race” to acquire the token. Grey BTC also predicts ONDO could hit $15 by 2025, which has further boosted investor confidence. Rumors of a Binance Spot Listing Speculation is another key factor pushing ONDO’s price higher. ONDO Futures are already available on Binance, one of the world’s largest exchanges. Now, investors are speculating about a possible spot listing on Binance, which would make ONDO more accessible to everyday traders. If this happens, it could increase demand and potentially drive ONDO’s price even higher. The Numbers Tell an Exciting Story The numbers behind ONDO’s rally are impressive. Its trading volume has increased by over 300%, reaching $834 million, while Open Interest in ONDO Futures has jumped by 50%, hitting $297 million. These numbers show growing investor participation, adding momentum to the rally. However, there’s a note of caution: ONDO’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has risen to 85, which means the token is in overbought territory. This could lead to a short-term price pullback. Supply Shortage Could Fuel More Gains On the other hand, recent data shows a change in ONDO’s exchange netflow. On November 28, ONDO’s Exchange Netflow turned negative, with more tokens being withdrawn from exchanges than deposited. Around $4.10 million worth of ONDO has been moved to private wallets over the past week, suggesting a supply squeeze. With fewer tokens available on exchanges and rising demand, this could be contributing to the price surge. Why RWA Tokens Are a Big Deal ? Looking beyond the current price spike, ONDO is part of a growing trend. According to Phoenix Group, a leading on-chain analytics platform, ONDO is currently one of the top four cryptocurrencies in the Real-World Asset (RWA) market, along with OM, PENDLE, and POLYX. These projects are showing strong weekly trading volumes and significant price movements, reflecting their resilience in the market. ONDO, in particular, is benefiting from increasing investor interest and a tightening supply, making it a token to watch in the coming months.",POSITIVE,ONDO,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | ONDO,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ondo-finance-ondo-hit-new-all-time-high-whats-behind-the-explosive-price-rally/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Table of Contents Why FatBot could skyrocket into the top 5 trading bots Thrilling opportunities to take advantage of Stay connected Crypto trading has seen incredible growth, with trading bots processing over $2 billion in transaction volume in just a few days, as shown in the image below. This immense activity has generated an estimated $20 million in revenue within a week, highlighting the lucrative potential of these tools. However, many existing trading bots fail to maximize this opportunity due to poor user experience, inefficient features, and limited innovation. Fortunately, there’s a trading bot that will soon be launched and has the potential to stand out by solving all these problems— FatBot from FATTY . And it’s already expected to reach the top 5. Why FatBot could skyrocket into the top 5 trading bots FatBot , the highly anticipated trading bot from FATTY, is set to redefine the trading experience for crypto enthusiasts. With its groundbreaking features and carefully designed infrastructure, FatBot is poised to become one of the top 5 trading bots on the market. But what makes it stand out in an increasingly competitive space? The foremost aspect is that FatBot is built to address common shortcomings in the general trading bot landscape. Many bots on the market struggle with clunky monetization models, uninspiring referral systems, and overly complex interfaces that deter new users. FatBot changes the game by offering an intuitive design, robust functionality, and attractive incentives, making it accessible and rewarding for experienced traders and newcomers. Moreover, it has something that no one has—a truly smart Sniping 2.0 feature. Unlike standard sniping bots that typically use basic execution techniques, Sniping 2.0 empowers users to define specific trading criteria, offering a tailored and strategic trading experience. This feature enhances trade accuracy and supports up to 100 times more snipes than conventional sniping bots, unlocking greater opportunities in dynamic and fast-moving markets. FatBot’s development has been a meticulous process led by CleevioX, a studio renowned for its work on one of the existing top 5 trading bots, in collaboration with Moon5 Labs. This partnership combines expertise and innovation to deliver a tool that meets the highest standards in crypto trading. And if we’re looking at the numbers, the FATTY ecosystem, which includes the FATTY token and FatBoy P2E game, has already demonstrated its potential by raising $5.6 million during its token presale. So, with FatBot’s launch on the horizon, it’s clear that FATTY is a platform driven by unique solutions, transparency, and a commitment to delivering value to its community. These qualities make FatBot a strong contender for joining the ranks of the top trading bots and leaving a lasting mark on the crypto industry. Thrilling opportunities to take advantage of With FatBot’s launch just around the corner, the FATTY ecosystem is buzzing with activity and opportunities for early supporters. Chief among these is the ongoing FATTY token presale, a chance for investors to secure tokens at a great price before the official listing. Since the presale kicked off on July 4, 2024, it has raised an impressive $5.6 million from over 8,000 enthusiastic backers.

37170683,https://coinpedia.org/?p=388603,1733226029,How High Can XRP Go? XRP Price Prediction Amid Whale Accumulation,"The post How High Can XRP Go? XRP Price Prediction Amid Whale Accumulation appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The last month was simply special for XRP; a steep growth from $0.51311 to $1.95710 in just 30 days was definitely unusual, as well as exciting. This development brings to a vital question: what will be the future of XRP – the most controversial crypto? And, the story begins here! XRP’s Stunning November Performance The talk of the town is XRP’s exceptional performance in November. The XRP market truly deserves this newly gained attention and even this late appreciation, for the fact that it outperformed almost all the other top cryptocurrencies last month. How is it even possible for a crypto, which was considered ‘partly filled’ until recently? The 297% rise in November of XRP – the highest monthly return since December 2017 – definitely says a lot about its future potential. At the start of the month, with a price of $0.51311, there were no signs for an impending massive uptrend, other than the general expectation among investors that the US election could overturn the market scenario. On November 5, when the political scenario started to tilt towards Pro-Crypto Leader Donald Trump, the market showed its first sign of growth. Between November 5 and 30, what we saw was a steep climb from just around $0.5 to a few micro points less than the milestone of $2 – which the market achieved on the first day of December itself. Bold XRP Predictions from Top Analysts There is no confusion that the XRP market is unlikely to face any disruption in its upward momentum anytime soon; even during the previous month’s bull cycle, it only faced two corrections, both minor in nature. But how far can the market go up? There are analysts who predict the next target of XRP to be $10. The problem with these exaggerated predictions is that most of them have no digestible reason to support them. Meanwhile, Jacob Canfield’s $6.60 target looks convincing for the simple reason that it has the one element that most of the other predictions lack: a solid reason to support it. Canfield’s prediction is backed by Fibonacci extensions and Bitcoin’s 2017 comparison. Increased Activity in the XRP market from Retail and Whales Who will fuel this predicted growth, retailers or whales? Neither whales nor retailers seem to be ditching the XRP market anytime soon. There are enough indications in the XRP market data that new retail investors are entering the market. Additionally, a recent report says that whale accounts accumulated 679.1M tokens worth $1.6B in three weeks. So, the trend is clear. XRP’s Bullish Momentum and Key Resistance Levels In the last 24 hours, the XRP market has seen a rise of 15.1%. The coming days are not going to be easy for XRP, considering that there is little resistance left on the higher timeframe of the XRP chart. However, the one thing that most XRP enthusiasts agree on is the potential of the XRP to close above the $1.99 mark – to mark its highest yearly close in history.",POSITIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/how-high-can-xrp-go-xrp-price-prediction-amid-whale-accumulation/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

This is primarily due to the fading opportunities of speculative investments attached to memes and the growing demand for coins with established use cases and thriving communities. Rexas Finance has risen up the ranks and is seen as the token that will take DOGE’s place in getting investors’ eyes. RXS is not a simple cryptocurrency; it’s a universe of brilliance that seeks to change the world by financing and monetizing true assets. Rexas Finance has the wind at its back, registering strong presale figures and entering the market with new concepts, certainty, and safety to become the leader of the new wave in the blockchain industry. Rexas Finance (RXS): Tokenization of Real-World Assets Rexas Finance is redefining the blockchain industry with an emphasis on digitizing physical assets (RWA). Rexas enables everyone to build wealth by allowing fractional ownership of expensive assets such as land, rare goods, and other valuables such as agriculture. RXS uses various features to create a safe, rapid, and public medium for 21st-century investors through blockchain. Rexas Finance achieved amazing success during its presale phases, collecting over $19 million and moving 278 million tokens in eight stages. The eighth stage bears the price of $0.10 for RXS, which is reasonable for long-term players. The design of these strategies is to cater to varied investors while gaining steam ahead of the anticipated tier-one exchange listing in 2025. Considering the projected launch price of the coin at $0.20, first-round participants are poised to realize two-fold returns on investment right after listing their coins. Rexas Finance has five core elements as the engines of its ecosystem that make it a one-stop shop for blockchain investing: 1. Rexas Estate: Investments in real estate are now possible through property tokenization. Investors interested in having a share of the real estate do not need to own property in total but only a part of it, thus lowering entry barriers into the market. 2. Rexas Launchpad: Designed to enhance several new blockchain projects, the Rexas Launchpad platform offers a fair fundraising approach while giving RXS holders the opportunity to invest early in companies they believe in. 3. Rexas Token Builder: By feeding primary elements into this construction module, companies and individuals can generate tokens backed by blockchain without requiring high-level development skills, enabling effortless asset tokenization. 4. Rexas GenAI: The AI-enabled platform offers NFT creators essential insights and assistive tools to improve and optimize workflows within the digital asset domain, resulting in increased productivity and creativity. 5. Rexas Treasury: A multi-chain yield optimizer, the Treasury allows users to deposit crypto assets and generate great interest while enabling them to switch between blockchain networks. Tokenomics Rexas Finance has developed its tokenomics to demonstrate long-term viability and growth. The total number of RXS tokens does not exceed 1 billion. Of this amount, 42.5% is earmarked for the presale to enable early investors to purchase the asset. Additionally, 22.5% has been set aside for staking rewards to encourage holders with a long-term view. Fifteen percent comes from liquidity, ensuring trading remains stable, while lower proportions are allocated for treasury, marketing, collaborations, team bonuses, and gifts. This allocation simultaneously funds the project’s growth and serves the needs of its community, which is highly beneficial for the project’s future prospects. Listing and CertiK Audit Rexas Finance is listed on top cryptocurrency monitoring platforms such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. This higher visibility and exposure make it easier for investors interested in RXS to track its performance. Furthermore, Rexas Finance has completed a SOC 2 audit through CertiK. This bolsters investor trust in the platform’s smart contracts and infrastructure, ensuring that the project can be executed properly. Community Engagement and Giveaway Rexas Finance also aims to build and maintain a robust community. To encourage more users to join and increase activity in the ecosystem, the platform will hold a $1 million giveaway. Twenty winners will each receive RXS tokens worth $50,000, offering an exciting opportunity to be part of this project. To win the giveaway, interested investors must visit the official Rexas Finance platform and complete tasks like following REXAS social media channels, reposting informational content, or inviting friends. The more tasks completed, the higher the chances of winning, making the giveaway engaging. How to Buy RXS Tokens The process of acquiring RXS Tokens is straightforward: 1. You should download compatible blockchain wallets, including ERC-20 wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet. 2. Acquire either ETH or USDT from the trading platform that deals in cryptocurrencies. 3. Transfer the funds into your wallet. 4. Visit the Rexas Finance official site and link your wallet via WalletConnect or another supported tool. 5. Specify how many RXS tokens you want to buy, approve the transaction, and pay the gas fees. After the transaction is completed, your RXS tokens will be sent to your wallet, allowing you to use them or stake them within the Rexas network. Conclusion Unlike Dogecoin, its meme-coin predecessor, RXS has the potential to create a better future. Rexas Finance is a project designed to tokenize real estate and is built to last. Its innovative features focus on tokenizing real-world assets and performance during the presale phase, making it a standout project in the crypto market. With its listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, CertiK audit, and community-driven $1 million giveaway, RXS is well-positioned to introduce the next generation of blockchain technology. While all investments carry risks, RXS is an exciting opportunity for investors looking beyond meme coins. Visit the Rexas Finance website now and join the presale for this project.

As the crypto market rallies this December, SHIB looks ready for even more growth . With this breakout, there’s a real chance that Shiba Inu could DOUBLE its value in the coming days! Shiba Inu To See Double-Digit Gain Currently, SHIB is facing a crucial resistance level of around $0.00003050, and analysts are closely watching how the coin reacts. According to Shib Knight , a well-known crypto analyst, the price chart is forming a bullish “cup and handle” pattern. If SHIB successfully breaks above this resistance, it could soar, potentially reaching levels above $0.000045, marking an 83% rally. This follows patterns of past sharp upward trends after periods of steady consolidation. In addition to the cup and handle formation, SHIB’s chart also shows a Golden Cross, a pattern indicating a potential bullish trend. The 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) are also signaling a bullish crossover, which further supports the theory of an upward move, driving SHIB’s price to experience double-digit gains. Shiba Inu Network Growth Another factor driving Shiba Inu to surge more is its growing popularity, as shown by its network growth. Over the past week, 7,548 new wallets have been created, with significant increases in key address metrics. Santiment data highlights this surge, with new addresses up by 62.54% and active addresses rising by 57.88%. Meanwhile, this growing interest suggests Shiba Inu could gain more popularity in the long run. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bullish Sentiments for XRP & ADA May Fade Soon-Here’s Why FOMO May Not Work This Bull Run , Whale Burn 2.022 Billion Shib Token In addition to this, an anonymous whale burned over 2 billion SHIB tokens , pushing the burn rate up by more than 3,160%. This reduction in supply could also contribute to the price rally, especially as Shib’s price is trying to recover and break above the $0.00003 level after dropping from $0.00003316 on Dec 02.

Bitcoin has experienced significant price fluctuations recently, resembling a rollercoaster ride. After dipping below $91,000 last Tuesday, the cryptocurrency quickly bounced back above $98,000.However, resistance at this level has prevented Bitcoin from surpassing the $100,000 threshold. While the market navigates these ups and downs, experts remain divided on Bitcoin’s near-term potential.Tom Lee, the Chief Investment Officer at Fundstrat Capital, reiterated his bullish stance on Bitcoin during an appearance on CNBC. He confirmed that Bitcoin is facing a psychological barrier around the $100,000 level, as it is a key point of interest for market participants.Despite this, Lee remains confident that Bitcoin will close the year at six figures. He emphasized that if Bitcoin breaks the $100,000 threshold, a major surge could follow, attracting more traders.Meanwhile, Lee’s outlook extends beyond the immediate price action. In a separate interview on November 29, he predicted that Bitcoin could reach $250,000 within the next 12 months. He linked this forecast to historical trends, noting Bitcoin's substantial price increases following previous halving cycles. Lee also pointed to shifts in U.S. political support for cryptocurrencies, suggesting that Bitcoin could benefit from increased legitimacy, particularly if the U.S. government begins accumulating Bitcoin as part of its strategic reserves. He believes that institutional adoption, exemplified by companies like MicroStrategy, will also play a significant role in driving Bitcoin’s price upward.Bearish Sentiment Amidst Market OptimismWhile Lee’s outlook remains bullish, other analysts, including Ali Martinez, have raised concerns about Bitcoin’s short-term price trajectory. Martinez acknowledged the ongoing bearish narrative within the market, citing various indicators of a potential correction. However, he maintains that Bitcoin's long-term outlook remains positive.Several prominent figures, such as Sheldon the Sniper and Robert Kiyosaki, have also expressed caution regarding Bitcoin’s future. Sheldon forecasts a possible downturn that could push Bitcoin below $90,000, attributing this to recent bearish candle closures. While maintaining his belief in Bitcoin’s eventual rise to $250,000 by 2025, Kiyosaki warned of a potential drop to $60,000 before any rebound occurs.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/03/fundstrats-tom-lee-is-confident-bitcoin-will-surpass-100000-by-year-end/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=fundstrats-tom-lee-is-confident-bitcoin-will-surpass-100000-by-year-end,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Although the total amount stolen marked a 53% decline from October’s staggering $20.2 million. The report highlighted one particularly devastating incident in which an individual lost $661,000 worth of stETH (staked Ethereum) in just minutes. The losses occurred amid a backdrop of evolving scam tactics, with malicious actors leveraging increasingly sophisticated methods to exploit unsuspecting users. Source: X / @realScamSniffer November Phishing Scams: How Bad Was It? The November scams were marked by a recurring pattern of malicious signature requests, which proved to be the most potent tool in the attackers’ arsenal. Victims unknowingly authorized transactions that drained their wallets entirely, leading to notable losses such as $409,000 in WBTC on the Arbitrum network and $344,000 in FET through Ethereum’s Uniswap platform. Another $220,000 in USDT was lost through a direct transfer. Source: X / @realScamSniffer ScamSniffer emphasized that malicious signature requests remain the most effective weapon for phishing scammers. A significant development in November was the emergence of a new phishing method dubbed “ Angel Drainer ,” which rose to prominence following the exit of the notorious Inferno Drainer operation. As Scam Sniffer called it, this evolution is likened to a hydra—cutting off one head simply results in another emerging. [4/7] PHISHING EVOLUTION Inferno Drainer's exit led to Angel Drainer's rise. Like a hydra – cut off one head, another appears. The threat never dies, it evolves. https://t.co/r2RVyLCGFN — Scam Sniffer | Web3 Anti-Scam (@realScamSniffer) December 3, 2024 While the total amount stolen in November was lower than in previous months, the number of victims remained alarmingly high. Source: X / @realScamSniffer This aligns with broader findings from blockchain security firms like CertiK, which reported that phishing accounted for $343.1 million in losses across 65 incidents in Q3 2024 alone . The use of fake accounts on social media platforms and deceptive Google ads were among the most common tactics employed to lure victims to phishing websites. Raising Awareness: DeFi Security at Risk The crypto community faces an uphill battle to curb the prevalence of phishing scams as attackers continue to refine their strategies. ScamSniffer’s report urged users to remain vigilant, stressing that one misplaced signature could lead to devastating financial losses. In response to these threats, the firm has urged users to use tracking agencies like MistTrack to monitor suspicious transactions and flag potentially malicious activities in real-time. Educational efforts are also becoming more prominent, as projects aim to equip users with the tools and knowledge necessary to avoid phishing traps. ScamSniffer has recommended a combination of best practices, including verifying every signature request and avoiding impulsive actions during transactions. [5/7] DEFENSE GUIDE • NEVER rush to sign transactions • Verify ALL signature requests • Use ScamSniffer extension • Use Anti-Scam Enhanced Wallets One wrong signature = Empty wallet Think twice, sign once. https://t.co/in0eXyJN1g — Scam Sniffer | Web3 Anti-Scam (@realScamSniffer) December 3, 2024 Furthermore, developing anti-scam-enhanced wallets and browser extensions tailored to detect and block phishing attempts has become a key focus area for blockchain developers. Notably, November saw not only phishing attacks. XT.com, a Seychelles-based cryptocurrency exchange, reported a suspected $1.7 million hack . While the exchange initially attributed the suspension to “wallet upgrade and maintenance,” blockchain security firm PeckShield alleged that the platform lost 461.58 Ether (ETH) in a hacking incident. Similarly, Crypto casino platform Metawin suffered a $4 million hack on November 3, targeting its Ethereum and Solana hot wallets. The attacker exploited Metawin’s “frictionless withdrawal system,” prompting the platform to halt withdrawals while temporarily securing its systems. So far, December started with the same trend. On December 1, Clipper, a decentralized exchange, experienced a $450,000 hack due to a vulnerability in its withdrawal function. This affected two liquidity pools and locked approximately 6% of its total value.

On December 2, the transfer raised eyebrows, prompting executives, analysts, and crypto advocates to call it a strategic misstep. United States Space Force engineer Jason Lowery was quick to voice his concerns on social media, declaring that the government’s actions reflect a lack of understanding of the true value of Bitcoin. “There is no price where it makes sense for the US to sell any Bitcoin it has under its control,” Lowery remarked, highlighting the broader implications of such a decision. He pointed to the infamous Executive Order 6102, signed in 1933, which banned the hoarding of gold in the U.S., suggesting that the government’s lack of foresight in managing Bitcoin might lead to similar regrets in the future. Potential Impact on BTC Market The timing of the transfer saw Bitcoin’s price dip nearly 3%, plummeting to around $94,500 before rebounding to $96,000 at the time of writing. Many analysts argue that the sale or transfer of such a substantial amount of Bitcoin could have a lasting impact on its market dynamics. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong weighed in on the controversy, echoing Lowery’s sentiments, stating that the government should not consider selling its Bitcoin. Crypto educator Toby Cunningham added to the conversation, warning that if the government were to sell its Bitcoin, the market would likely absorb the supply rapidly, causing price volatility. While the public response has been overwhelmingly negative, some experts are not entirely convinced that the US is selling its holdings. Tether strategy advisor Gabor Gurbacs suggested that the transfer could be part of the government’s ongoing efforts to consolidate Bitcoin wallets or update old addresses. Crypto analytics platform Spot On Chain also raised the possibility that the transfers were merely custody actions rather than outright sales. What’s Next for the US Bitcoin Holdings? So far, the US government has moved a total of 25,999 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $2.49 billion, to Coinbase this year. Yet, the nature of these transfers remains somewhat unclear, with many speculating that only a portion of these Bitcoins were sold. Julio Moreno, Head of Research at CryptoQuant, suggested that it is highly likely that only around 10,000 Bitcoin were actually sold, with the remaining 9,800 moved to a newly created address. According to Spot On Chain, the US government still holds around 183,850 BTC, worth roughly $17.7 billion, across various known addresses. This latest development has left many crypto enthusiasts questioning the US government’s long-term strategy with Bitcoin . Whether the recent transfer is a sign of a larger policy shift or simply a routine move remains to be seen.

In the final seconds of the video , the iPhone screen showcases the meme coin Peanut the Squirrel( PNUT ), a token that is currently unavailable on Coinbase listings. Yet on the exchange’s new Apply Pay tutorial, the token is featured as number one on its trending list and placed under the spotlight tag. Moreover, the last clip in the tutorial reveals a PNUT price page with its glowing green chart hiking upwards. Many traders on X were quick to notice this little easter egg and took it as a sign that the viral squirrel-themed meme coin could be coming to Coinbase. “List coinbase soon.

Though, the video’s link remains “unlisted” under the official Coinbase YouTube account at the time of writing. The tragic origins of PNUT and FRED Launched in November, PNUT and FRED are both Solana-based meme coins that pay tribute to the viral internet animal pair, a squirrel named Peanut and a raccoon named Fred. Peanut was rescued from a car accident by Mark Longo, who ran an Instagram account depicting the life of Peanut and Fred. But the animals met a tragic end when they were confiscated by the New York City Department of Environmental Conservation from Longo’s home in New York, citing anonymous complaints. Peanut and Fred died after they were allegedly euthanized by officials. The incident caused public outcry, especially among animal rights activists and ordinary people, including Elon Musk, who saw the squirrel as emblematic of unnecessary government overreach.

Once hailed as a breakthrough in blockchain funding, the 2017 EOS ( EOS ) initial coin offering now faces harsh criticism from Arthur Hayes , who dubs it the “most value-destructive” offering of the year despite its massive $4.1 billion raise. In his latest blog post dubbed “The Cure,” the co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX , pointed to EOS’s post-launch stagnation as emblematic of the risks posed by large-scale ICOs. Despite the lack of significant progress or innovation following its launch, EOS has managed to retain a market cap of $1.2 billion, a striking testament to the volatility of the crypto space, he noted. “There was obvious dogshit that ICO’d in 2017. My award for the most value-destructive ICO goes to EOS. Block.one raised $4.1 billion in crypto to build EOS. EOS launched and was never to be heard from again.” Arthur Hayes The ex-BitMEX CEO acknowledged the ICO’s execution, calling it a “thing of beauty” from a financial market perspective, though underscored that the long-term value of EOS failed to live up to the hype. He stressed that although the project’s ICO marked the peak of the 2017 crypto bubble, many other projects from that era also disappeared without a trace. “To shoot for the 10,000x, you must accept that most of your investments will trade near zero post-ICO. But that’s better than the current VC coin setup, where 10,000x is almost a mathematical impossibility, but you can still be down 75% a month after a CEX launch.” Arthur Hayes In his commentary, Hayes also cautioned retail investors about the dangers of high fully diluted valuation and low float tokens, warning against “overvalued tokens” on centralized exchanges that could harm investors’ portfolios. He also advocated for a return to ICOs that give retail participants a chance to achieve significant returns, calling for renewed “fanatical support” for new crypto projects.

Despite the massive funding, the EOS platform struggled with many of the technical and governance issues it had promised to address. Eventually, in 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Block.one for conducting an unregistered securities offering in the U.S., which led to a $24 million settlement, though Block.one did not admit wrongdoing.

Originally set to take effect in January 2025, the tax will now be implemented in 2027. The decision was announced after lawmakers reached an agreement amid ongoing political challenges and concerns about its impact on the market. Park Chan-dae, the floor leader of the Democratic Party of Korea, confirmed the agreement, stating, “We have decided on a two-year moratorium for the cryptocurrency tax proposed by the government.” The postponement was made despite earlier disagreements between political parties, with some favoring alternative solutions such as increasing tax-deductible thresholds instead of delaying the tax. Previously, the People’s Power Party had proposed delaying the tax until 2028, while the Democratic Party suggested raising the tax-free limit from 2.5 million won to 50 million won. However, both parties eventually agreed to push back the implementation date to 2027. This move allows lawmakers to further evaluate the potential effects of the tax and gives crypto traders more time to adjust. Once the law is enacted, South Korean investors will face a 20% tax on profits from cryptocurrency trading. The government initially planned to implement the tax in 2021 but postponed it multiple times, citing concerns about its possible negative impact on the local cryptocurrency market. The ongoing delays reflect the government’s cautious approach toward regulating this emerging sector. Park emphasized that while they agreed to delay the cryptocurrency tax, their party opposes reforms to inheritance and gift tax laws that would favor the wealthiest citizens. These proposed changes include reducing the inheritance tax rate from 50% to 40% and increasing deduction thresholds for beneficiaries. The latest delay provides an opportunity for both the government and the crypto industry to assess the broader implications of taxing digital asset gains.

Matrixport wrote in its daily analysis that Bitcoin has historically seen six Decembers of positive returns and four Decembers of negative returns. If this trend continues, BTC could reach $110,000 by the end of the year, according to Matrixport. Analysts finally stated that the fourth quarter was the most robust period for Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market in general, adding that the highly anticipated altcoin season could begin during this period. “Bitcoin’s December performance has historically been somewhat mixed, with 6 positive months and 4 negative months reflecting a 60% probability of gains. Despite this, the average December return comes in at a solid +9.6%. If this trend continues, Bitcoin could close the year around $110,000. Seasonal patterns have strongly shown that the fourth quarter typically delivers the strongest gains, and it is not surprising that the much-anticipated altcoin season has begun during this period.” *This is not investment advice.

According to a report from Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett, the announcement may come tomorrow. NEW: @realDonaldTrump ’s pick to replace @GaryGensler as @SECGov Chair could be announced as soon as tomorrow, sources tell @FoxBusiness . Stay tuned . — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) December 3, 2024 This development comes after Gensler’s resignation announcement . His chosen date coincides with Trump’s return to office. Gensler’s tenure has been marked by stringent enforcement actions against the crypto industry, which many in the space argue have stifled innovation. The most prominent example is the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple, which resulted in prolonged uncertainty for XRP. With Gensler’s departure on the horizon, XRP has surged to its highest price since 2018, signaling renewed investor confidence. Potential Candidates for SEC Chair Several prominent names have been suggested as potential successors to Gensler. Among them is Christopher Giancarlo, the former Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and a vocal advocate for blockchain innovation. Often referred to as “CryptoDad,” Giancarlo is viewed by many as the frontrunner and a potential ally for the cryptocurrency industry. Brian Brooks, the former Acting Comptroller of the Currency, is another strong contender. Known for his pro-crypto stance, Brooks has been a key figure in advancing regulatory clarity for digital assets. Other potential candidates include Daniel Gallagher, currently serving as Robinhood’s Chief Legal Counsel; Brad Bondi, a partner at the law firm Paul Hastings; Paul Atkins, CEO of Patomak Global Partners; and Bob Stebbins, former SEC General Counsel. Many experts and crypto advocates, including well-known attorney John Deaton, have supported Bondi while standing with Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Stuart Alderoty against Stebbins. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market and Industry Reactions The possibility of a more crypto-friendly SEC Chair has generated optimism in the industry. XRP’s recent price rally reflects broader market enthusiasm, as investors anticipate a regulatory environment that could foster innovation and reduce legal uncertainty. Critics of Gensler’s tenure argue that his approach to crypto regulation has been excessively adversarial. Industry leaders have pointed to the SEC’s enforcement-first strategy as a barrier to technological progress and market growth. The appointment of a new Chair, especially one with a balanced view on crypto regulation, is a potential turning point. The dismissal of the lawsuit could also send XRP higher. There have also been rumors that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse met with Trump recently, and the crypto community can rest assured that the new administration will choose the right person for the job.

Binance’s native chain remains slower compared to Solana, but the increasing interest in crypto trickled down to trader and bot activities. BNB Smart Chain has become the site of sandwich attacks, which are prevalent on top chains like Ethereum and Solana. A significant number of users have found themselves sandwiched by bots on the network, as both DEX activity and attacks increased in the past months. The recent spike in bot attacks coincides with an all-over growth of DEX activity. Almost all DEXs on the chain saw sandwich bot activity. PancakeSwap accounts for more than 88% of bot attacks on the BNB Smart Chain. PancakeSwap carried more than 88% of bot sandwich attacks, with the risk spreading to smaller DEXs on BNB Smart Chain. | Source: Dune Analytics BNB Smart Chain aims to protect itself through novel block-building mechanisms. More than 92% of blocks are created by block builders , presumably to achieve a fair distribution of block space. However, even with deliberate block-building, sandwich attacks are still included in those blocks. During the 2021 bull market, ApeSwap briefly became the main hub of sandwich attacks, which later spread to PancakeSwap and smaller DEXs. Almost no market is safe from attacks on its most active pairs, or specific tokens. In the last weeks of November, the bot attacks also affected the Uniswap version on BNB Smart Chain, which led to a record number of swaps being sandwiched. Daily volumes on all decentralized markets grew past $16B , with many of the DEXs having a BNB Smart Chain version. Bot transactions sandwiched trades in 35.5% of blocks Up to 35.5% of all BNB Smart Chain blocks contained sandwich transactions, a record rate. Those attacks have a small, but growing share of DEX trades. In November, up to 43,400 traders were affected by MEV bots and sandwich attacks. There were 645 active bots unleashed on the network, taking an estimated $1.32M from $9.23 in DEX volumes. In comparison, Ethereum only had 83 bots active as of December 3, all attacking specific contracts and tokens tied to DEX hubs. For BNB Smart Chain, the attacks select a few top pairs. They may also threaten trending tokens and random assets. The absolute record in sandwiched traders is 48,470 from January 2024. At this current level, the stats are closing in on the record. The biggest share of attacks happens on random tokens, with no particular target. Some pairs get habitually sniped by sandwich bots. Those pairs include USDT-WBNB and USDC-USDT, while WBNB and USDT are the most sandwiched assets. The monthly volume of sandwiched pairs varies, but traders can check the most common targets for attacks. For now, BNB Smart Chain lacks real-time monitors on trending attacks. Sandwich bot attacks are often counted among exploits, as they often rug-pull big traders attempting to cash out on trending tokens. BNB Smart Chain does not hold the most valuable assets, though it may contain copy tokens or its own ecosystem of assets. As of December 3, BNB Smart Chain once again saw Simon’s Cat (CAT) trending, Sandwich attacks are not random, but target trending valuable tokens, especially ones with the most active trading. Bots get activated when traders try to find gems among DEX tokens, often going after significant value. BNB Smart Chain goes through a slow recovery BNB Smart Chain has a mempool, which is visible through API, and bots can glean information about DEX swaps. The problem has existed for years, and no viable solution has yet been found. Bots only recede when overall trading slows down, as during periods of stagnation or bear markets. BNB Smart Chain has more than 1M daily active users, though the types of activity are shifting. The activity only gradually recovered in the past three months, as BNB Smart Chain was slow to grow its DeFi value. As of December 3, BNB Smart Chain holds $5.48M in value locked, lagging behind Ethereum and Solana. However, the persistence of sandwich attacks suggests the protocol still carries trending assets. The increasing activity may also boost the native BNB token, which is currently trading at $649.43.

37169849,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656419,1733223631,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Charting The Roadmap Of BTC To $150,000 By 2025","Crypto analyst TradingShot had predicted before that the Bitcoin price could rally to as high as $150,000 in this bull run. With the flagship crypto now close to the $100,000 milestone, the analyst has charted Bitcoin’s current price action and provided insights into how the crypto could reach this $150,000 target by 2025. The Current Bitcoin Price Action And Road To $150,000 In a TradingView post, TradingShot stated that the Bitcoin price is now off the 0.786 to 1.0 Fibonacci range, where it consolidated from March 2024 until October 2024. The analyst noted how the breakout in October was largely thanks to the US presidential elections and the euphoria after Donald Trump won. Related Reading: Fantom Price Breakout: Analyst Shares Anatomy Of FTM’s 18,000% Move To $150 By 2025 TradingShot said that the Bitcoin price is only one month outside this range and is already much higher. He noted that last month’s candle was similar to November 2020 and May 2017. Coincidentally, those periods were when the “most aggressive rallies of those bull cycles started.” The crypto stated that the Bitcoin price was at a 71.5° angle between May and December 2017. In the 2021 cycle, Bitcoin was at a 68.5° angle (3° lower) between November 2020 and April 2021. If this happens to be a trend, TradingShot remarked that it is safe to assume that the 2024/2025 parabolic rally could be at a 65.5° angle (-3° from the previous cycle). In line with this, TradingShot said that this gives the Bitcoin price a potential target of $300,000 as early as May 2025 if the crypto records a double top cycle as in 2021. Meanwhile, the crypto analyst asserted that the $150,000 target is “very plausible” from a technical analysis perspective since it is just below the top of a multi-year channel he highlighted on the chart. BTC’s Next Move Still Unclear Amid this bullish prediction for the Bitcoin price, crypto analyst Kevin Capital has suggested that BTC’s move is still unclear. He stated that while Bitcoin has a lot of liquidity to the downside of about $88,000, the real bulk of liquidity is still around the $100,000 to $103,000 range. Based on this, the analyst stated that it is best to sit back and watch what comes next. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto has suggested that the Bitcoin price may experience a cooling-off period in the meantime. This came as he revealed that the sell signal has flashed on Bitcoin’s dominance for the first time since 2020. In line with this development, he stated that it is officially altcoin season. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Litecoin Is About To Pull An XRP, Here’s What He Means Blockchain center data shows that it is indeed altcoin season. In the last 90 days, 75% of the top 50 coins by market cap have outperformed the Bitcoin price. With this being altcoin season, Bitcoin could cool off while altcoins record parabolic rallies.

Rexas Finance (RXS), a breakthrough token providing a distinctive approach to blockchain technology and real-world asset tokenization, is one such initiative that is garnering headlines. As of this writing, Rexas Finance (RXS) is currently priced at $0.125 in its presale. Analysts predict that it will reach $17 during the next 60 days, an amazing 17,000% rise. Thanks to its fast growth potential, RXS is positioned as a top alternative for Polygon (POL) for investors looking for significant gains. The Revolution in Real-World Asset Tokenization Rexas Finance (RXS) is a leader in closing the distance between blockchain technology and real-world assets (RWAs). Unlike conventional cryptocurrencies, which may function in isolated digital ecosystems, RXS emphasizes bringing actual assets, including real estate, art, goods, and intellectual property, onto the blockchain. Our invention offers unmatched convenience. It lets users tokenize any real-world asset from anywhere on the globe, permitting either complete or fractional ownership. Rexas Finance (RXS) opens countless opportunities by arming people and businesses to tokenize assets in a few clicks. It provides a clear platform for new and experienced investors to hold, trade, and easily handle RWAs. This bold vision positions Rexas Finance as a transformative force in cryptocurrency, addressing the limitations of existing blockchain networks like Polygon (POL). Strong Presale Performance: A Key Indicator of Growth Rexas Finance’s (RXS) continuous presale offers evidence of its market attractiveness and strong demand. Now at its eighth stage, RXS is reasonably priced at $0.125, which attracts early investors. Reflecting general trust in the project, the presale has already brought an amazing $20 million. The Rexas Finance team made one noteworthy choice: they turned down venture capital (VC) money even after several offers. The team has made sure that the advantages of this innovative concept are reachable by giving public participation a top priority. This dedication to diversity has further increased investor confidence and driven presale activity. The Path to $17: What Drives the Prediction? Driven by rising investor interest and higher demand, analysts estimate that its price might explode to $17 within 60 days. Several elements support the estimate that Rexas Finance (RXS) might hit $17 in sixty days. First, the coin’s special value proposition has generated a lot of buzz in the crypto world, attracting interest from institutional and retail investors. Second, with almost $20 million raised so far, its presale performance shows great market confidence. The deliberate timing of its listing on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko has also enhanced its visibility, augmenting its pricing momentum. Investors looking for consistent market data depend on these sites, so RXS’s participation has strengthened its credibility. The scarcity effect is projected to generate notable price increases as more investors join the market since demand exceeds supply. With its existing price of $0.125, Rexas Finance (RXS) offers an unmatched investment possibility. For example, should the token achieve its expected price of $17, a $1,000 investment in RXS at this point might earn $170,000. For those looking for significant profits, RXS is a unique option because of its possibility for exponential increase. The project’s emphasis on RWAs fits more general market trends since tokenization is becoming more popular in many sectors. By meeting a real and increasing demand, RXS establishes itself as a useful tool with great future possibilities. Conclusion Not only a substitute for Polygon (POL), Rexas Finance (RXS) transforms the bitcoin scene. RXS presents a special value proposition that has drawn interest in the market by closing the distance between blockchain technology and actual assets. Its great presale performance and integrated strategic measures, including CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko listings, have created the conditions for fast expansion. Smart investors would want to take advantage of the chance to invest in Rexas Finance at just $0.125, as analysts estimate a jump to $17 within 60 days. Whether your goal is to diversify your portfolio or profit on the next major crypto rally, RXS is one coin with extraordinary potential.

37170313,https://invezz.com/?p=2335962,1733223421,"Cambodia blocks 16 crypto exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase","Cambodia has reportedly blocked access to several cryptocurrency exchanges in the country, including the industry’s leading platforms Coinbase, Binance and OKX. The Cambodian government is taking this crypto regulation step amid efforts to combat crimes related to crypto assets, Nikkei Asia reported on Dec.3. According to Nikkei Asia, market regulators in Cambodia have blocked access to 16 crypto exchanges. These include the industry’s largest and most popular exchanges such as Binance, OKX, and Coinbase. The authorities reportedly took this action after the exchanges’ failure to register and secure relevant regulatory approvals, which are key to the licenses providers need to offer their services and products in the country. However, while the Securities and Exchange Regulator of Cambodia (SERC) has blocked web access to the 16 exchanges, it has not banned the platforms’ apps. The move comes as the country faces increased international pressure about its growing status as a central hub for crypto cybercriminals. The United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime has previously pointed to increased use of crypto across dark markets, while on-chain data has suggested billions of dollars worth of transactions have been facilitated via cryptocurrencies. It includes the Chainalysis report that showed Huione Guarantee has used crypto for transactions worth over $49 billion between 2021 and 2024. 102 domains blacklisted Under the law, exchanges seeking to offer their services in Cambodia have to apply for and acquire licenses. The oversight for this is under the FinTech Regulatory Sandbox, a SERC program linked to the country’s Non-bank Financial Services Authority. Only two companies currently have the relevant regulatory nod to offer digital assets trading. Accordingly, regulators have banned 102 domains, including those related to online crypto-gambling sites and exchanges. The Asian country currently ranks as one of the top 20 in retail adoption of crypto per capita. Meanwhile, data shows the various centralized exchanges account for 70% of transactions, suggesting a potential impact from the reported ban. However, Binance and other blacklisted crypto exchanges have had a growing presence in the market. In 2022, the Binance team signed a memorandum of understanding with the Securities and Exchange Regulator as the country looked to develop its crypto regulation framework. The exchange also sealed a major collaboration with Cambodian conglomerate Royal Group. In Aug 2024, Binance and other exchanges resumed operations in India after the country blocked access and ordered the removal of their apps from Google Play Store and Apple App Store. The return followed a seven-month ban, which started in January 2024 and came after regulatory action by the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) in December 2023.

37169724,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=106682,1733223184,Bitcoin-Backed Credit: A Pathway to Financial Access for the Unbanked,"The global financial system is not serving all people equally. An estimated 1.4 billion adults remain unbanked according to the World Bank . This is to say that they cannot access even the simplest of banking services, like loans or savings accounts. For most, financial exclusion isn’t just a matter of inconvenience; it’s life-changing. Inflation, a lack of documentation, and rigid banking systems create cycles they cannot seem to break. Bitcoin-backed credit might offer a lifeline. What is Bitcoin-Backed Credit? Bitcoin-backed credit enables people to use their Bitcoin holdings as collateral in loans. Like other regular loans, it requires no credit scores or much paperwork; rather, here’s how it works: Borrower pledges Bitcoin as collateral. Lender provides liquidity in fiat or stablecoins. If the borrower fails to repay, collateral is liquidated. This model ensures simplicity and accessibility. Borrowers retain ownership of their Bitcoin while accessing cash or stablecoin liquidity. Platforms like BlockFi, Nexo, and Celsius have popularized this system. Benefits of Bitcoin-Backed Credit Bitcoin-backed credit addresses many of the shortcomings of traditional finance . Here are its key advantages: No credit checks. Loans are based on collateral value, not credit history. This opens the door to millions without banking access. Protection against inflation. Borrowers can secure loans in stable currencies while avoiding the devaluation of local fiat. Preservation of Bitcoin holdings. Loans allow users to access liquidity without selling their Bitcoin, keeping them exposed to potential price growth. Global accessibility. These platforms are accessible to anyone with Bitcoin, regardless of location or citizenship. Feature Traditional Loans Bitcoin-Backed Credit Credit Check Required Not needed Collateral Options Limited Bitcoin Accessibility Restricted by location Global Inflation Hedge None Yes Risks of Bitcoin-Backed Credit Despite its benefits, Bitcoin-backed credit carries significant risks. Price volatility. Bitcoin’s price can drop suddenly, triggering margin calls. Borrowers may lose their collateral if they cannot add more Bitcoin. Regulatory challenges. Government oversight, like the EU’s MiCA framework, may impose stringent requirements on these platforms. Wealth concentration. Wealthier crypto holders, or “whales,” benefit the most, potentially leaving small-scale users excluded. Centralized influence. Traditional financial institutions are entering the space, which may compromise Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos. Real-World Impact and Limitations Bitcoin-backed credit has shown its potential to change lives. In Argentina, where inflation exceeds 120%, residents can hedge against currency devaluation. In Lebanon, where the banking system has collapsed, Bitcoin-backed loans offer a lifeline. However, success stories are mixed with cautionary tales. Many borrowers have lost their Bitcoin during market downturns, particularly during the 2022 crash. Others face barriers due to know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, which limit access for those without proper documentation. The Path Forward For Bitcoin-backed credit to thrive, it must balance innovation with inclusivity. Decentralized platforms like Aave and Sovryn offer promising alternatives. These systems use smart contracts to eliminate any intermediaries, thus ensuring greater transparency. Decentralization might introduce its own challenges with security risks and regulatory uncertainty. The future of Bitcoin-backed credit depends on its capability for remaining accessible and in tune with the grounds of decentralization. It could either democratize finance or become another tool of exclusion. The challenge lies in ensuring this innovative system stays true to its roots while adapting to the changing financial landscape.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Bitcoin World,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-backed-credit-a-pathway-to-financial-access-for-the-unbanked/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png

Moreover, large holders accumulated over 76 million TRX yesterday. Spikes in whale activity usually create FOMO (fear of missing out) among retail investors, potentially increasing the buying pressure. This would put TRX in a fairly good position for a short-term price hike. However, increased whale activity and trading volume could mean high price volatility. On the other hand, the TRON exchange net inflows have also shifted from a net outflow of 104 million TRX to a net inflow of 81 million TRX between Nov. 30 and Dec. 2, per data from ITB. The sudden shift suggests that investors are preparing to take short-term profits. Any whale selloff at this point could trigger FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) among retail holders, causing an increased selling pressure. Notably, crypto.news data shows that the TRX Relative Strength Index is also hovering above the 70 mark. The indicator suggests that the asset is slightly overbought at this price point.

Donald vs Israel (DONISRA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONISRA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Donald vs Israel can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald vs Israel could become the next viral memecoin. Donald vs Israel launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Donald vs Israel on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald vs Israel by entering its contract address – CKYA6Q1KcWsSJyXgFKwyNXyTAjHD1dRPKTDD2FTUFryn – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others.

The Institute of International Finance (IIF) estimates that these tariffs may reduce the Euro Area's GDP by 0.4%. This comes at a time when many European countries are still recovering from the pandemic and facing growing competition from China. According to the IIF, the economic impact could be “substantial,” particularly for nations heavily reliant on transatlantic trade. Germany, France , and Italy are expected to bear the brunt of these changes. Germany , the U.S.’s largest exporter in the Euro Area, faces zero economic growth for the second consecutive year. The country’s machinery and industrial goods exports could be significantly affected. Italy’s exports in similar sectors are also vulnerable. France, meanwhile, risks a 4% decline in exports from key industries such as aerospace and luxury goods over Trump’s term, according to the IIF. While the potential damage is clear, the timeline for implementing tariffs remains uncertain. Trump’s statements on trade policies often make headlines quickly, but the actual rollout of tariffs tends to take weeks or months. This lag depends on how actively the administration leverages tools like the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. “ Trump’s tariff threats and their execution don’t always align,” notes the IIF, pointing to his previous term when he backed down from a proposed tariff on Mexico after the country agreed to tougher border controls. Analysts also suggest that the impact of Trump’s plans will vary, with some initial threats being toned down or adjusted during negotiations. However, industries across Europe are bracing for potential disruptions, particularly as the U.S. administration hints at more protectionist policies. The situation remains fluid, and all eyes are on how these policies evolve in the coming months. European exporters and governments must navigate these uncertainties while balancing the need for economic recovery and competitive positioning on the global stage. As the new administration lays out its strategies, the Euro Area will be closely monitoring developments, including Trump’s communication channels like Truth Social, for further indications of policy direction.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | FIAT | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/eurozone-braces-for-trump-tariff-impact,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37169591.jpeg

The community was quick to pick up the move and outline some massive predictions of up to $6. ADAUSD. Source: TradingView ADA’s Bull Rally ADA stood at around $0.32 on November 5, the day of the US elections, and was relatively sluggish at first, even as the rest of the market was charting impressive gains following Trump’s decisive victory. However, its own rally began that weekend when IOG founder Charles Hoskinson said he will spend a lot of time in 2025 working alongside the Trump administration to establish a more favorable and comprehensive crypto policy in the States. Cardano’s token exploded to over $0.6 at the time, but more promising hints coming from Hoskinson sent it further north. ADA neared $1 and after a few rejections there managed to break above that level. Its rally was stalled for a few days but the bulls are back in charge now as they pushed ADA to just over $1.3 earlier today, which meant a 20% surge at one point. This became the asset’s highest price point since mid-January 2022. Consequently, ADA has overtaken USDC and is now the eighth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, as the metric stands above $45 billion. ADA to $6? ADA’s breakout led many analysts to speculate on its future price growth. Some of the more modest predictions indicated that the asset could rise up to $1.5 next, which sounds achievable even for the short-term, given the recent price developments in the market. Popular analyst Ali also outlined the same target following ADA’s price surge above $1.25, which invalidated a previous forecast for a 20% correction. Invalidated! $ADA goes to $1.50 next. https://t.co/OhJXrA2MSM — Ali (@ali_charts) December 2, 2024 While $1.5 seems very plausible at the moment, others made some big claims that ADA could peak at $6 during this cycle. AllInCrypto’s analyst based this prediction on ADA’s behavior during the 2017 and 2021 bull runs. It’s worth noting that such a price tag would put Cardano’s market capitalization at over $210 billion. In the current environment, this sounds slightly exaggerated as this would make ADA the third-largest digital asset.

DAAs grew on the mainnet but declined in the broader ETH ecosystem due largely to usage declines on Base. Solana officially passed Ethereum in full-month fees, but Ethereum remains the giant in the DeFi space, with a 57% share of broader TVL. As ETH continues to act inflationary following Dencun, there is an opportunity cost in holding the asset through an ETF that can't actively stake on-chain. But as far as simple, inexpensive exposure to price changes in ETH goes, ETHA is a solid option. In recent weeks, we've seen explosive rallies in the digital asset market that have taken popular coins to new multi-year highs and in some instances, all-time highs. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) came within a couple of hundred dollars of tagging a six-figure coin price. XRP ( XRP-USD ) just hit its highest price since January 2018. Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) reached a coin price level not seen since May 2021. Enthusiasm in the market is high. Data by YCharts Yet, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) still hasn't taken out levels seen earlier this year. In this article, we'll look at how on-chain activity has progressed since October , capital flows over the last month, and assess whether investors should consider the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF ( ETHA ) for ETH exposure. On-Chain Data Following up on what I called a ' quietly positive ' October for the Ethereum ecosystem a month ago, Ethereum and the secondary layers built on top of it continued to develop through November. On-chain usage was a bit mixed, with daily active addresses (or DAAs) declining 12% from 3.2 million in October to 2.8 million in November among the chains shown in the graphic below. Artemis The biggest reason for this decline in ecosystem users was Base - which fell from 1.4 million DAAs in October to 1.1 million in November. Ethereum's main layer actually saw month-over-month growth in DAAs from 366k to 400k, 9% more than October and 25% more than November 2023. Ethereum's MoM DAA trend shows outperformance against the broader public blockchain industry, as aggregate data from Artemis shows daily active addresses falling nearly 5% to 17.8 million over the last 30 days. Where it really counts, though, is the fees: Artemis The good news is Ethereum's monthly fees grew 33.6% over October from $142.2 million to $190 million, a 7-month-high. Perhaps the bad news is Solana ( SOL-USD ) surpassed Ethereum in monthly fees in November. And at 6.7 million DAAs on Solana alone, the smart contract usage growth appears to be happening on alternative chains more than within the Ethereum ecosystem. That said, swapping memecoins through DEX trading isn't the only way a public blockchain can (or should) be utilized. DeFi is still a major component of this industry, and Ethereum continues to be the boss in that category: DefiLlama There is over $128 billion in total value locked via DeFi protocols per data from DefiLlama and 57% of that TVL is on Ethereum. There is a 'switching cost' to moving this DeFi activity to a different chain, and to this point we're just not seeing that happen. In fact, measured in ETH, TVL on Ethereum is up 44% year to date from 13.2 million ETH to 19 million ETH as of December 1st. This is admittedly below the high of the last bull cycle in 2021, but ahead of any TVL peak going back the last two years. Capital Flows In my personal opinion, there is no real way to sugarcoat it; Ethereum's price performance this year has been very disappointing. While Bitcoin has produced a new all-time high 43% higher than the 2021 peak, Ethereum's fresh all-time high over the peak from the last cycle still eludes investors. And there is perhaps a good reason for this; the capital flow story simply hasn't been there for ETH. However, that has seemingly started to change if November is any indication. According to data tracked by CoinShares, capital flows into digital asset investment products capped off an 8th consecutive positive week to close out November. The final week of November was actually the 11th week out of the last 12 that had positive net flow into digital asset investment products. That final week in November was a bit of an outlier, as it was Ethereum rather than Bitcoin that propelled the net flow to positive territory: Asset ($m) Week Flows MTD Flows YTD Flows Bitcoin -$457 $6,226 $33,912 Ethereum $634 $1,427 $2,198 Multi-asset -$16 -$25 $441 Solana -$4 $40 $110 Binance - $0 -$2 Source: CoinShares, Bloomberg, as of 11/30/24 To put that $634 million into proper context for the final week of November, that single week accounted for 29% of the year to date asset flow for Ethereum investment products. It was a huge week and perhaps indicative of a large sentiment shift in ETH heading into December and beyond. Key Risks: ETH Supply & Lack of Staking Ultrasound.money There continues to be a key risk in Ethereum, dating back to the Dencun upgrade earlier this year pertaining to ETH supply. Now that the Layer 2 scaling chains aren't paying as much in fees to the main layer as they previously were pre-Dencun, what had been a deflationary 'ETH burn' dating back to 'The Merge' has flipped back to supply inflation. By itself, this is not a reason to sell ETH or get bearish. Most chain-native smart contract assets happen to be inflationary. But it does mean that staking the asset becomes more important, as investors may seek to combat the supply inflation through new issuance by staking for rewards: 1yr Trend (StakingRewards) Going back the last year, we've seen ETH rewards generally trend down below 4%. The current reward rate of 3.1% is near the 52-week low and has perhaps unsurprisingly come in tandem with a drop in staked ETH from 34.5 million on November 6th to 34.2 million ETH as of December 2nd. The key risk to consider here for investors in the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF would be that the ETH held by the fund is not currently staked. That means that ETHA holders are paying a management fee for the opportunity cost of investing in ETH that doesn't generate a yield. TheBlock Regardless, that opportunity cost from un-staked assets is certainly not unique to ETHA and compared to the other spot ETH ETFs in the US market, investors can do a lot worse than the iShares product. While it isn't the lowest expense ratio at 0.25%, ETHA is certainly competitive with peers and has been far and away the biggest recipient of fee flight asset migration from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF ( ETHE ). Closing Summary I'm still long Ethereum, both directly on-chain and through the ETF wrapper. In my view, sentiment in ETH is poor even though scaling efforts have grown ecosystem usage. The main chain is still absolutely dominant in the DeFi space and significant TVL migration from Ethereum to cheaper networks has yet to happen at scale despite clear user incentives for such switching to occur. To be sure, there are serious risks in both direct ETH ownership and in ETF proxies. Without significant growth in usage or higher gas fees, ETH will likely continue to be inflationary. In that reality, there is an opportunity cost in longing for ETH through ETFs like ETHA. All this said, I don't think the broader rally in the digital asset space is done yet, and I think recent capital flows are indicating it is Ethereum's turn to make a new high.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4741681-etha-is-it-ethereums-turn-yet?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37169530.jpeg

Many believe the new administration will bring friendlier regulations and a more supportive approach to digital assets. Coinbase’s Chief Policy Officer (CPO), Faryar Shirzad, recently stated that legislation related to the crypto sector could pass through Congress “fairly quickly” under the new administration. Shirzad told CNBC that a pro-crypto president and what he called the “most pro-crypto Congress in history” will help move key legislation forward. This shift, he said, will ensure that the voices of over 50 million Americans who own cryptocurrency are finally heard in policymaking. Shirzad expressed optimism about the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) and the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act of 2023. While he acknowledged the slim chance of these bills passing during the current lame-duck session, he expects “significant progress” and possible approval of both pieces of legislation in the coming year. These laws aim to provide clarity on market structures and stablecoin regulation, marking a critical step for the industry. January 20, 2025, is shaping up to be a turning point for crypto. Not only will Trump take office, but the crypto community will also see the exit of long-time critic Gary Gensler, the current Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Gensler has led a strict regulatory crackdown on crypto over the past three years, but his departure signals potential changes for the SEC. Trump, who endorsed crypto during his campaign, has promised to appoint someone aligned with his vision for the industry. Shirzad refrained from speculating on who Trump might pick as the new SEC chair but expressed confidence that the President will choose someone supportive of innovation. “If he selects a change-maker who shares his vision, it will be good for the industry, the U.S., and crypto users,” Shirzad said. The crypto sector is also celebrating its electoral success, with 298 industry-friendly candidates voted into Congress, a majority that advocates for a supportive environment for blockchain and digital assets. Coinbase executives, including CEO Brian Armstrong , have highlighted this as a victory for the industry and a sign that voters want change in how crypto is treated. With pro-crypto legislation on the horizon, the future of the industry looks promising. Supporters believe the incoming administration will bring clarity and growth opportunities, ensuring the U.S. remains a leader in financial innovation.

37169413,https://coinpaper.com/6349/bernstein-forecasts-staking-yield-for-ethereum-et-fs-in-the-us,1733222384,Bernstein Forecasts Staking Yield for Ethereum ETFs in the US,"The cryptocurrency market is currently experiencing significant shifts in investment trends, with Ethereum (ETH) and XRP standing out as pivotal forces driving this transformation. In the year 2024, investment funds focused on ETH achieved remarkable milestones, breaking previous records by attracting an impressive $2.2 billion in net inflows. This surge in investment suggests a renewed sense of confidence among investors regarding the potential of this digital asset. At the same time, XRP has also made headlines, witnessing its largest-ever inflows, which approached nearly $100 million. This surge in interest comes amid growing anticipation surrounding potential regulatory advancements and exciting new product launches that could further enhance XRP's market position. Ethereum ETFs with Staking Yield Could Revolutionize US Crypto Market: Bernstein Report United States-based Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) may soon offer staking yield, a move that could significantly enhance their appeal to investors, according to a Dec. 2 report by Bernstein Research. The report suggests that under a more crypto-friendly leadership within the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ethereum staking yields could gain regulatory approval, setting the stage for a transformative development in the burgeoning cryptocurrency ETF market. Ethereum staking involves locking Ethereum (ETH) as collateral with a network validator on the Ethereum blockchain. This process enables stakers to earn payouts from network fees and other rewards. However, staking also comes with the inherent risk of ”slashing,” where ETH collateral may be forfeited if the validator engages in improper behavior. As of Dec. 2, ETH staking yields an approximate annualized return of 3.1%, according to StakingRewards.com . Bernstein analysts predict that staking yields could climb to 4–5% during periods of elevated activity on the Ethereum blockchain, adding a significant incentive for ETF issuers and investors alike. The SEC’s current restrictions prevent spot Ethereum ETFs from staking ETH for additional yield, despite numerous requests from leading issuers such as Fidelity, 21Shares, and Franklin Templeton. However, with US President-elect Donald Trump set to take office on Jan. 20, 2025, the regulatory landscape may be poised for a seismic shift. Trump has vowed to position the United States as the “world’s crypto capital,” a vision that aligns with his reported intention to appoint crypto-friendly leaders to key financial regulatory roles. Bernstein analysts anticipate that this change in leadership could accelerate the approval of staking yields for Ethereum ETFs, a move that would provide investors with a more lucrative and diversified product offering. Ethereum Fundamentals and Market Sentiment Ethereum, often regarded as the second-most prominent cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, has experienced fluctuating performance in recent years. However, the report highlights a notable resurgence in investor interest, as evidenced by record-breaking inflows into Ethereum investment funds. In 2024, ETH-focused funds witnessed net inflows totaling $2.2 billion, surpassing the previous record of $2 billion set in 2021. This trend signifies a renewed sense of optimism among investors, according to CoinShares. Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s head of digital asset research, projects an ambitious future for Ethereum. Sigel anticipates that the Ethereum network could generate up to $66 billion in annual free cash flow by 2030, potentially driving the price of ETH to a staggering $22,000 per token. “Ethereum fundamentals look strong, and the recent inflection in ETF inflows indicates a solid revival of interest,” Bernstein noted. The potential approval of staking yields for Ethereum ETFs marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market in the United States. By incorporating staking rewards, ETFs would not only offer exposure to the price movements of ETH but also provide investors with a steady yield, bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi). This development could position Ethereum ETFs as a preferred investment vehicle for both retail and institutional investors, fostering greater adoption and liquidity within the crypto ecosystem. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, the anticipated introduction of staking yields in Ethereum ETFs represents a landmark opportunity to redefine investment strategies. Under a Trump administration that prioritizes a pro-crypto regulatory environment, the United States could emerge as a global leader in digital asset innovation, setting a precedent for other jurisdictions. The path forward hinges on regulatory clarity and the ability of the crypto industry to demonstrate the robustness and security of staking mechanisms. For now, all eyes are on the SEC and its forthcoming leadership to shape the future of Ethereum ETFs and the broader cryptocurrency market. Ethereum Investment Funds Break Record in 2024 as Altcoins Gain Momentum ETH investment funds have shattered their previous record, with net inflows of $2.2 billion in 2024, surpassing the cryptocurrency’s 2021 peak of roughly $2 billion, according to a Dec. 2 report by CoinShares. This milestone marks a significant shift in market sentiment toward Ethereum, reflecting a resurgence of investor confidence in the digital asset. CoinShares attributed the record inflows to a “dramatic turnaround in sentiment” for Ethereum. The milestone was reached during a year of heightened investor interest in cryptocurrency-backed financial products. Total inflows into cryptocurrency investment products reached over $37 billion in 2024, setting a new annual record. In the week starting Nov. 26 alone, cryptocurrency investment products recorded net inflows of $270 million. Ethereum was a standout performer, with inflows of $634 million during the period, signaling growing investor preference for ETH over Bitcoin. The latest CoinShares report revealed a shift in investor focus from Bitcoin (BTC) to Ethereum. Bitcoin experienced outflows of $457 million during the same week, marking its first significant outflows since September 2024. This pivot from BTC to ETH could indicate the early stages of an “altcoin rotation,” where investors shift focus from Bitcoin to other cryptocurrencies. Felix Hartmann, founder of Hartmann Capital, described the trend as a sign that Wall Street is “officially joining the fun” in the altcoin market. The enthusiasm for Ethereum was further highlighted by crypto commentator Ethereum Vibin, who noted in a post on X that “ETH ETF flows have flipped BTC ETF flows for the first time.” The rotation toward Ethereum gained additional momentum after a landmark victory for Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem in a United States court. This legal win bolstered confidence in Ethereum’s broader applications beyond cryptocurrency trading. XRP Gains Ground Amid Ethereum’s Surge While Ethereum dominated inflows, Ripple’s XRP also experienced a record-breaking week. XRP investment products saw inflows of nearly $100 million, the largest in its history. CoinShares attributed the surge to excitement around the possibility of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) and growing optimism about Ripple’s role in a pro-crypto regulatory environment under President-elect Donald Trump. The influx of capital into XRP propelled it past Solana (SOL) in market capitalization on Dec. 1. Shortly thereafter, XRP also surpassed Tether’s USDt (USDT), becoming the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. This milestone marks a significant achievement for Ripple, as the company positions XRP as a cornerstone of blockchain-based payments. Ripple’s stablecoin project, RLUSD, has also drawn significant attention. The dollar-pegged, overcollateralized stablecoin project is anticipated to launch in early 2025, further fueling investor optimism. The strong inflows into Ethereum and XRP indicate the growing interest in alternative cryptocurrencies as the market evolves. Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem and staking capabilities, coupled with the possibility of ETF approvals, make it an attractive option for investors seeking diversified exposure. Meanwhile, XRP’s ascent shows the increasing importance of blockchain technology in payments and stablecoin development. Ripple’s focus on regulatory compliance and strategic partnerships may further solidify its position in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin’s outflows, though notable, do not signal waning interest in the leading cryptocurrency. Instead, they reflect a natural rotation of capital as investors explore opportunities in other digital assets. Bitcoin remains the dominant cryptocurrency by market cap, and its institutional adoption continues to grow. The record-breaking inflows into Ethereum funds and the growing traction of XRP signal a transformative period for the cryptocurrency market. With the anticipated pro-crypto policies of President-elect Trump’s administration, 2025 could bring further regulatory clarity and expanded opportunities for cryptocurrency investment products. As altcoins like Ethereum and XRP gain momentum, the cryptocurrency market appears poised for a new wave of innovation and adoption. Whether this marks the beginning of a sustained “alt season” or a temporary rotation remains to be seen, but the signs point to an exciting year ahead for digital assets.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | XRP,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | XRP,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6349/bernstein-forecasts-staking-yield-for-ethereum-et-fs-in-the-us,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

37169269,https://coinpaprika.com/news/metamask-leader-explores-the-future-of-self-custody-wallets,1733222133,MetaMask Leader Explores the Future of Self-Custody Wallets,"Self-custody wallets give users full control over their digital assets, eliminating the need for intermediaries. They represent financial independence and privacy, key principles of the crypto ecosystem. However, governments are imposing tighter regulations on these wallets. For instance, Brazil has restricted stablecoin transfers to self-custody wallets, aiming to centralize financial oversight. This poses a significant challenge to the freedom these wallets provide. Unlike custodial wallets managed by third parties, self-custody wallets ensure users have complete ownership of their funds, safeguarding them from risks such as exchange failures, as seen in the FTX collapse. According to Hester Bruikman from MetaMask, self-custody wallets are crucial for enhancing financial sovereignty, security, and privacy. They enable users to transact directly, without relying on centralized entities, and offer protection against data collection practices. Despite their benefits, these wallets are criticized for being complex and risky for new users. Innovations like smart contract accounts (SCAs) are addressing these issues. SCAs replace the traditional single-key system with flexible recovery methods, such as passkeys or multi-party computation, making them more secure and user-friendly. Other advancements include gas fee abstraction, allowing transaction fees to be paid in any token, and session keys for smoother approvals. These improvements make it easier for users to manage their crypto safely and efficiently. However, regulatory challenges loom. Governments worldwide are tightening rules on self-custody wallets. Brazil’s Central Bank has introduced measures to block stablecoin transfers to these wallets, attempting to align crypto with traditional finance. Similarly, Europe’s MiCA framework enforces stricter anti-money laundering rules on transactions over $1,050 involving self-custody wallets. These regulations aim to combat financial crime but risk limiting the use of decentralized tools. This regulatory pressure is already slowing innovation, particularly in the United States, as Bruikman highlights. The US Treasury recently dropped a controversial 2020 proposal that would have imposed severe restrictions on self-custody wallets, including banning peer-to-peer transactions and requiring detailed reporting on all activities. While this was a victory for decentralization advocates , the ongoing push for regulation continues to challenge the principles of crypto. Self-custody wallets are more than tools for holding crypto; they symbolize financial freedom, particularly in regions with unstable economies like Brazil. They protect user privacy and enable participation in decentralized ecosystems like DeFi and gaming without intermediaries. These wallets are vital for maintaining crypto’s core promise of decentralization, but the path forward requires balancing oversight with autonomy. The future of self-custody wallets looks promising, thanks to technological advancements like SCAs and gas fee abstraction. Adoption is expected to grow, with the market projected to reach $3.5 billion by 2031, growing at an annual rate of 8%. Hybrid models blending autonomy with compliance could provide a solution to ongoing regulatory pressures. The crypto community must continue to innovate while advocating for tools that protect user sovereignty in an increasingly regulated landscape. Ultimately, self-custody wallets represent a crucial choice: Will you trust your crypto to an intermediary, or keep control in your hands?",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/metamask-leader-explores-the-future-of-self-custody-wallets,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37169269.jpeg

Santa Pepe (SANPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Pepe by entering its contract address – 2NefXDdBhUkVn7dXW5wxVtCHKHKE8uiRGUqZGxT5HAN8 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANPEPE.

While $100,000 is expected to open soon, Bitfinex analysts said in their latest report that Bitcoin is facing a short-term correction but is also ready for a breakout of $100,000. Bitfinex analysts noted in their weekly Alpha report that Bitcoin has recovered despite an 8.64% decline last week and is continuing its upward momentum heading into December. Analysts said this short-term correction was due to $135.1 million in outflows from spot ETFs last week and profit-taking by long-term investors who sold 508,990 BTC since September. However, amid rising retail interest and outflows, along with stronger ETF inflows and increasing demand, especially from short-term investors, analysts said Bitcoin is well-positioned to break past the psychological $100,000 barrier. Analysts stated that the rise in Bitcoin depends on short-term investors, and said, “If short-term investor demand can meet long-term investor sales, BTC can exceed $ 100,000.” “November ended on a high note for Bitcoin despite a brief turmoil last week. BTC suffered its biggest pullback since the US elections but quickly recovered, posting a record-breaking monthly close at $96,506. Historically, December has been a volatile month for Bitcoin, with Bitcoin halving years also delivering exceptional average returns of 38.86%. Given the current bull market dynamics, we believe Bitcoin is poised for further upside despite a potential short-term correction.” *This is not investment advice.

37169118,https://coinpaprika.com/news/arthur-hayes:-bring-back-decentralized-icos,1733221725,Arthur Hayes: Bring Back Decentralized ICOs,"Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, is advocating for a return to the roots of initial coin offerings (ICOs), calling for a decentralized, retail-focused approach to crypto funding. In his manifesto, “How to Make ICOs Great Again,” Hayes critiques the current dominance of venture capital ( VC ) firms and centralized exchanges (CEXs), which he argues have sidelined retail investors in favor of institutional interests. Hayes highlights how today’s crypto landscape has strayed from its core principles of decentralization and community empowerment. He criticizes the influence of VCs and CEXs, which he likens to a ""CEXually transmitted disease,"" for pushing projects toward inflated valuations that alienate ordinary investors. “Why did we forget that crypto was meant to empower retail investors?” Hayes asks. He identifies three key factors that have driven crypto’s success: decentralization as a counter to traditional power structures, revolutionary blockchain technology, and the speculative drive for financial gains. However, he argues that retail investors—the backbone of crypto’s meteoric rise—have been marginalized by projects that cater to institutional players. Meme coins, despite their speculative nature, represent a more inclusive model by allowing retail participants to take part in the market without gatekeepers. Hayes calls for a revival of ICOs as a solution. He sees them as a way to return power to communities by enabling direct fundraising and broad participation. While he acknowledges the failures of many 2017 ICOs , he argues that their speculative nature was a feature, not a flaw, allowing retail investors to aim for significant financial rewards. “Retail investors would rather take a risk on a small, decentralized project than invest in a heavily inflated VC-backed token,” Hayes explains. He outlines a roadmap to revitalize ICOs, emphasizing the importance of decentralization, faster token issuance, and better technology. Advances in blockchain infrastructure, like lower transaction costs and improved scalability, now make ICOs more viable. Non-custodial wallets and user-friendly platforms further reduce barriers to entry, enabling more people to participate. Hayes advocates for avoiding centralized platforms and VC-backed projects with high valuations and low circulating supply. Instead, he encourages the community to embrace the speculative and democratic nature of decentralized ICOs. “It’s time to reject VC dominance and return to a system where retail investors can dream big and take bold risks ,” he concludes. With the market showing signs of entering a new bull cycle, Hayes predicts a resurgence of ICOs driven by retail investors and decentralized platforms like Pump.fun and Spot.dog. These tools, he believes, will empower a new wave of innovation, restoring crypto’s spirit of experimentation and financial inclusion.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/arthur-hayes:-bring-back-decentralized-icos,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37169118.jpeg

37170312,https://invezz.com/?p=2335829,1733221226,"Crypto phishing losses drop over 50% in November, reports ScamSniffer","Losses from cryptocurrency phishing scams dropped in November, with a little over $9 million, representing a 53% drop from the previous month. According to the November report from web3 security firm ScamSniffer , malicious actors stole approximately $9.83 million from cryptocurrency enthusiasts. The scams impacted 9,208 victims, reflecting a 23% drop compared to October. Cryptocurrency phishing losses have been steadily declining since August when scammers stole $63 million from 9,145 victims . However, the number of affected individuals increased to over 10,000 in September despite the total amount lost dropping to $42 million. ScamSniffer highlighted this trend, noting that despite the decrease in total losses, the number of victims remained significantly high. Approval phishing remained the leading attack vector, consistent with the trend seen over the past months. Approval phishing involves manipulating victims into unknowingly granting malicious smart contracts access to their cryptocurrency wallets. This tactic often employs social engineering techniques, such as fake websites or dApps promoted through fraudulent links on social media platforms. Scammers may impersonate well-known projects or services, luring users to interact with what appear to be legitimate interfaces. Once the victim approves the transaction, the attacker gains permission to withdraw funds or tokens directly from the wallet, resulting in significant losses. According to the blockchain analytics firm, the biggest loss of the month stemmed from a victim losing $661,000 worth of stETH. This utility token, representing a share of the total Ethereum staked through the protocol, was drained from the victim’s wallet within minutes after they unknowingly approved a malicious transaction. Other significant losses included $409,000 in WBTC on the Arbitrum network, $344,000 in FET on Ethereum’s Uniswap platform, and $220,000 in USDT on Ethereum via direct transfers. ScamSniffer advised users to exercise caution by avoiding rushed transactions and thoroughly verifying all signature requests to safeguard against phishing attacks. New phishing toolkits have emerged The drop in overall losses could likely be due to the fact that a number of major wallet drainers, including shut down their operations. Notorious toolkits like Pink Drainer, which stole at least $75 million, also closed shop earlier this year, as did Inferno Drainer, which netted $70 million before its shutdown in 2023. However, ScamSniffer warned that the operators behind the infamous Angel Drainer allegedly took over the Inferno Drainer project. Based on earlier reports, the original Angel Drainer team was identified by Match Systems earlier this year, leading to the operation’s shutdown, which was later confirmed through messages shared in the developers’ Telegram group. In September, cybersecurity firm Blockaid discovered a new wallet-draining kit called AngelX, which is estimated to be an upgraded version of Angel Drainer.

In contrast to 2FA implemented via short messages or other advanced digital approaches which are vulnerable to hacking and social engineering, those keys offer a nearly invulnerable level of protection. Why Phone-Number Linked Accounts Are a Security Risk On-chain sleuth ZachXBT responded with a crucial suggestion: Furthermore, phone number connection to the accounts, must be abolished by Coinbase. He said that getting rid of this feature will go a long way in halting social engineering scams which are usually started using phishing calls or messages from fake Coinbase support. The main outstanding threat type is social engineering, which takes advantage of certain aspects of security, such as SMS 2FA. There is often a practice when fraudsters succeed in cheating users into providing their account details, which results in account takeover and money loss. Hardware keys are effective in avoiding such breaches as they require hardware devices or gadgets to gain access to a system, with fewer chances of hacking. For better security, Coinbase has been promoting the use of these keys among its users. This call also resonates with other attempts to boost security standards as the threats attacking crypto investors are on the increase. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Don’t Fall for XRP Scams: Ripple Reveals Tips, Red Flags, and More! , Coinbase’s Move to Strengthen Crypto Asset Protection In order to eliminate threats arising from accounts connected to phone numbers, Coinbase seeks to enhance users’ trust as well as protect their possessions in the now high-risk crypto space.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/coinbase-account-safety-tips-how-to-eliminate-phone-number-risks/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

This new kid on the blockchain is smashing presale records and might just be your ticket to life-changing ROI gains. Here’s why Qubetics is a big deal—it’s not just another crypto project; it’s solving real-world problems its competitors couldn’t crack. Think: scalable blockchain development for non-coders, gasless transactions, and decentralised privacy solutions. Intrigued? Let’s break it down. ROI Meets Real-World Utility: Qubetics’ Blueprint for Blockchain Success What sets Qubetics apart? Two words: QubeQode IDE . Imagine a platform so intuitive that even someone with zero coding experience could create blockchain applications. That’s QubeQode—a drag-and-drop IDE that takes the hassle out of blockchain development. No more hiring expensive developers or struggling through clunky coding tutorials. Instead, businesses and professionals can whip up smart contracts or dApps in record time. It’s no wonder Qubetics is being hailed as the top crypto for innovators and investors alike. Picture this: A growing fitness studio wants to create a blockchain-based membership program that rewards clients with tokens for attending classes. With QubeQode, they can design and launch a smart contract in just hours, making loyalty rewards seamless and engaging. Or imagine a freelance graphic designer looking to protect and monetise their digital art—QubeQode empowers them to secure intellectual property rights effortlessly. This isn’t just tech; it’s a revolution, and Qubetics is proving why it’s the top crypto to watch right now. Over 259 million $TICS tokens have been sold, attracting more than 5,700 holders and raising over $4.1 million during the 11th presale stage. At just $0.0282 per token, it’s a deal too good to ignore. A $10,000 investment today could yield over $88,000 by the presale’s end or skyrocket to over $350,000 when $TICS hits $1. And when $TICS reaches $15 post-mainnet launch, that same $10K could transform into an astonishing $5.3 million. The Qubetics presale is your golden ticket. With the current price set to rise by 10% this weekend, the clock is ticking to secure your tokens before the price hike. Analysts are calling this the top crypto to watch, and honestly, who wouldn’t want in on those numbers? Hedera (HBAR): The Crypto That’s Literally Out of This World Hedera’s making waves—and not just on Earth. The coin’s been on a tear, jumping 76% to $0.2529 in just a week. Investors are hyped, and for good reason: the bullish trend shows no signs of slowing. If the momentum keeps up, HBAR could be climbing even higher. But there’s more to the story. Hedera’s teaming up with SpaceX to enable cryptocurrency transactions in space. Yep, you heard that right. Satellites sending payments to one another? That’s the kind of sci-fi tech HBAR is talking about. While this partnership might not directly affect HBAR’s price today, it’s putting Hedera in a league of its own. Even without the space buzz, Hedera’s efficiency and scalability make it a standout. Its unique hashgraph consensus algorithm ensures faster transactions and lower fees. It’s no wonder HBAR is gaining traction. Chainlink (LINK): The Steady Climber for Long-Term Gains Chainlink might not be skyrocketing like HBAR or breaking presale records like Qubetics, but it’s the steady performer every portfolio needs. Currently priced at $18.77 with a 3.05% uptick from last week, LINK is proving that slow and steady can still win the race. The big news? Chainlink’s price is predicted to double in the next three months. Sure, that might not be as flashy as a HBAR’s surge, but it speaks to LINK’s stability. This is the kind of crypto you buy and hold, knowing it won’t give you whiplash with wild swings. Its reduced volatility makes it a solid choice for investors eyeing long-term growth. Looking ahead to 2025, the Chainlink forecast is glowing. Ongoing developments and increased crypto adoption are driving optimism, and analysts are confident in LINK’s future. If you’re the type who prefers to play it safe while still betting on growth, Chainlink could be your best crypto investment now. Final Thoughts: Make Your Move If you’re looking for the top crypto to buy now, Qubetics stands out as the clear choice with unmatched ROI potential. Hedera and Chainlink have their strengths, but Qubetics is the all-in-one solution that’s rewriting the crypto playbook. So, what’re you waiting for? Head to the Qubetics website, join the presale, and lock in your $TICS tokens before the next price increase. The future’s bright, but it’s reserved for those bold enough to act today.

It sounds pessimistic, doesn’t it? Considering the optimistic nature of the current cryptocurrency market scenario, there seems to be no reason for the analyst to express a pessimistic view. Yet, the analyst sticks to his ‘not-so-welcoming’ view. Should altcoin enthusiasts be worried? A New Kind of Altcoin Season One thing that everyone agrees on right now is that the crypto market is going to witness an altcoin season soon. The thing that triggers disagreement is: will all the altcoins benefit from this season? Many, like Ki Young Ju, hold the depressing opinion that only a select few altcoins will benefit from this alt season. Bitcoin’s Separation From Altcoins Until recently, the correlation between bitcoin and altcoin was strong. To prove that the Bitcoin market no longer shares this tight connection with the rest of the crypto market, the prime argument that Young Ju puts forth is the one highlighting the creation of its own paper-based Layer 2 ecosystem by Bitcoin using ETFs, funds, and similar tools. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : France’s New “Unproductive Wealth” Tax Could Hurt Bitcoin – Here’s How , Breaking the Altcoin-Bitcoin Correlation The general belief is that altcoins move together with bitcoin. In the scenario of a weaker correlation, the belief is simply irrelevant. Anyway, the best thing about this new trend of altcoins breaking this correlation is that a few altcoins are showing the capacity to exhibit independent trends. The crypto expert also acknowledges this new trend in the altcoin market. In the last 30 days, XRP has surged by 423%, Dogecoin by 174.6%, Cardano by 272.9%, Avalanche by 115.2%, Stellar by 485.6%, Chainlink by 128.9%, Polkadot by 158.7%, Hedera by 689.4%, Pepe by 143.9%, and Cronos by 182.45. Survival Strategies for Altcoins There is a way out of this trap for the altcoin market. Young Ju presents two options: Either develop paper-wrapped products, like Bitcoin ETFs or build a real internet money system using stablecoins or Bitcoin. The funniest part is that both these options look equally tough. Anyway, there is no option. The altcoin market has to make a choice. FAQs What is the prediction for the upcoming altcoin season? Ki Young Ju predicts a selective altcoin season where only a few altcoins will benefit, not the entire market. Which altcoins are currently surging in value? Altcoins like XRP, Dogecoin, Cardano, and Hedera have recently surged by impressive percentages, showing strong growth in the last 30 days.",NEGATIVE,없음,ADA | ALTCOIN | BTC | DOGE | MARKET | CRO,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/altcoin-season-is-here-but-most-coins-are-doomed-warns-cryptoquant-analyst/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

In contrast, numerous altcoins have outperformed, charting mindblowing surges, such as ADA, AVAX, TRX, LINK, HBAR, and many others. BTC Stalls at $95K It was just a week ago when the primary cryptocurrency slumped hard and fell below $91,000, which became its most violent correction since the Trump-induced rally started in early November. However, the asset didn’t stay there for long and started to recover ground in the following days. The weekly peak came on Friday as BTC neared $99,000. Nevertheless, the bears managed to defend that level and pushed bitcoin down to approximately $96,500 during the weekend. Monday morning started with a surge to $98,000 but that was short-lived as BTC plunged to $95,000 almost immediately. Another rollercoaster followed suit with bitcoin jumping to $97,500 before it was driven south once again to $94,500. Despite its recovery attempts since then, BTC now trades just inches above $95,000. This decline means that BTC’s market cap has remained below $1.9 trillion, but its dominance over the alts has been pushed south hard. The metric is down to just 52% after peaking at nearly 60% weeks ago, according to CoinGecko. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 3.12.2024. Source: TradingView These Alts Do Good The past few days belonged to XRP and yesterday was no exception as the asset skyrocketed by another 25% at one point and neared $3 for the first time in almost seven years. Although it has retraced since then to $2.6, its market cap of $150 billion still places it as the third-largest cryptocurrency by that metric. Other massive gainers over the past 24 hours include ADA, which has soared by 17%, AVAX (11%), TRX (14%), DOT (16%), LINK (27%), SUI (15%), HBAR (42%), and quite a few others.

Trading at $0.00001712 early in November, the meme token soared 93% to $0.000033159 on late 1 December. The robust uptrend saw the frog-themed cryptocurrencies exploring price levels not seen over the past eight months. Subsequently, Shiba Inu’s ecosystem has witnessed robust growth, with address activity signaling improved engagements within the SHIB blockchain. Shiba Inu attracts new players On-chain analytics firm Santiment highlighted SHIB as among the altcoins seeing impressive network growths.

The upsurge matches surged engagements as the altcoin season narrative gains steam. Ripple’s XRP and Band Protocol witnessed similar trends, with 22,357 and 35 new address creations. Santiment added that the unprecedented network growth spikes highlight enhanced crowd engagement and euphoria. While increased retail activity could trigger volatile price actions in the near term, the trends suggest increased asset utility. IntoTheBlock data testifies to the increased address activity within the Shiba Inu blockchain. The project saw a 63% increase in new addresses within the past week, whereas active addresses surged by 58%. Further, zero-balance wallets increased by 62.01% in that timeframe, suggesting magnified liquidity and profit-booking after recent gains. Such trends are often visible during bull runs, confirming increased transaction volumes and speculative exits. Notably, price surges have historically followed these observations. SHIB’s price outlook The second-largest meme token by market value trades at $0.00002945, up over 70% on its 30-day chart. Source – Coinmarketcap SHIB appears to consolidate after hitting multi-month highs while still 22% up over the past seven days. Meanwhile, analysts remain bullish about SHIB’s performance. For instance, TSLA Tracker highlighted that Shiba Inu’s prevailing trajectory supports upside continuation to $0.00006937. $TSLA Tracker @SBZung · Follow I like $SHIB a lot from here: 5:54 PM · Dec 2, 2024 20 Reply Copy link Read 3 replies Such an uptrend would translate to a 136% gain from SHIB’s current prices. The indicators displayed mixed signals for Shiba Inu. The daily Relative Strength Index at 67 suggests that the asset is about to become overbought. That suggests potential retracements in the upcoming sessions. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence supports bullish actions, with the MACD line above the signal line. Furthermore, SHIB’s 24-hour trading volume has plummeted by 56% to $2.70 billion, signaling waning interest from traders. Shiba Inu will likely correct after its massive upswings to 8-month highs. Nevertheless, broad market sentiments remain vital in the token’s trajectory. Cryptocurrencies exhibit significant bullishness as analysts predict an imminent altcoin season. That suggests that any declines could be short-lived, positioning SHIB for rapid rebounds upon price dips. Also, the increasing user base would be crucial in offsetting bearish tendencies and supporting stable long-term price actions.

37168565,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98264,1733220125,Ripple XRP’s Price On The Brink Of Unbelievable All-Time Highs As Leak Reveals Mammoth December Bombshell,"San Francisco-based fintech startup Ripple is close to securing the final greenlight from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) for its overcollateralized dollar-pegged RLUSD stablecoin . According to a leak reported by Fox Business , Ripple is anticipated to launch RLUSD in the American digital finance market in the coming days after months of testing. The forthcoming stablecoin will bolster Ripple’s position in the U.S. digital market and the wider stablecoin ecosystem. RLUSD To Reportedly Go Live On Dec. 4 The New York Department of Financial Services is reportedly set to approve Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. Sources revealed to Fox Business that the company expects to roll out the new offering as early as December 4. Unlike XRP, which has suffered regulatory setbacks in the U.S. and price instabilities, the RLUSD stablecoin seeks to maintain a steady value tied to the U.S. dollar. This stability makes it much more attractive to individuals and institutions looking for a safe and reliable digital asset for transactions. Winning approval from the NYDFS, one of the strictest financial regulators, would strengthen RLUSD’s credibility. According to @EleanorTerrett 's recent article, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) is close to approving RLUSD. This approval highlights Ripple’s dedication to operating within a strict regulatory framework. 2/11 https://t.co/NyQDaMMc1d — Max Avery (@realMaxAvery) November 29, 2024 If the NYDFS indeed gives its blessing, the RLUSD stablecoin could revolutionize Ripple’s position in digital finance. This would enhance its competitiveness with other stablecoin issuers and fortify its standing in the U.S. market. Ripple’s Grand Foray Into The Stablecoin Market As you may recall, Ripple initially announced RLUSD in April 2024. The asset, the company said at the time, would be fully backed by U.S. dollars, short-term U.S. government treasuries, and “other cash equivalents.” Then in August, the blockchain payments firm kicked off testing of the stablecoin on its own XRP Ledger (XRPL) and the second biggest crypto network, Ethereum. Ripple eased investors’ fears by revealing that it would use both the RLUSD stablecoin and XRP in its near-instant international payments solution to serve its customers worldwide and significantly improve their experience. Notably, Ripple is teaming up with Uphold, Moonpay, and Bitstamp to introduce the stablecoin. These strategic collaborations will promote the asset’s adoption by customers by leveraging the top exchanges’ huge user bases and expertise in digital payments. The price of XRP has been climbing since Donald Trump’s election victory on Nov. 6 as investors anticipate a more lenient regulatory environment under his pro-crypto administration. Further gains were fueled by the revelation that crypto foe Gary Gensler will step down from his role as the Securities and Exchange Commission chair in January, which could signal that a potential spot XRP exchange-traded fund is now a matter of when not if. Moreover, the forthcoming RLUSD approval could help propel XRP above the longstanding all-time peak of $3.40.

This also marks a trend-reversal rally, gaining momentum as it surpasses the $0.050 psychological mark. With the new bullish rally at play, will the VET prices reclaim the $0.10 psychological mark? Let’s find out in our recent VET price action analysis. VET Price Analysis In the weekly chart, the VET price action showcases a long-coming resistance trendline, keeping the bullish growth under check. This resistance trendline started as the 2021 bull market started to lose momentum. Tradingview During this, the VET price fell to a low of $0.01317 in June 2023. However, since then, the VET price action has started to form a higher low formation, resulting in a support trendline. Therefore, the VET price movement has given rise to a symmetrical triangle pattern. In the recent bullish turnaround, the price surge from Nov. 5 resulted in a 256% rally. Starting from $0.018, the VET price has reached the current market price of $0.066. This has resulted in five consecutive bullish candles and surpassed the 23.60% Fibonacci level at $0.045. Further, it results in a new 52-week high at $0.070 and increases the chances of an uptrend continuation. VeChain Technicals and Price Targets The bullish turnaround has resulted in a merger between the 50- and 200-week EMA lines, which increases the possibility of a golden crossover. Furthermore, the MACD and signal lines have regained a positive alignment with the bullish histograms resurfacing. Hence, the technical indicators project a bullish extension of the VET rally. Based on the trend-based Fibonacci levels, the upside price target for VeChain stands at $0.1846, which could result in a new all-time high beyond $0.2823. On the flip side, the $0.050 will likely remain a strong support. Read More: VeChain Price Prediction: Will VET Price Hit $0.50? FAQs 1. What is the next target for VeChain (VET)?

According to an exclusive Reuters report, crypto firms are included among the companies listed in the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund subject to an investigation by the fund’s ethics council. The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund is the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world, with $1.8 trillion in investments. It owns 1.5% of listed shares in 8,700 companies across the globe. This year, the fund has increased its holdings in crypto exchange, including Coinbase , Block Inc., and Marathon Digital . With Coinbase in particular, the fund owns a 0.83% stake, which is worth around $453 million. “The Council on Ethics in 2025 will take a closer look at companies involved in cryptocurrencies and gambling/casino, where there is a significant risk of money laundering,” said the council in a drafted document filed to the country’s finance ministry. Gambling firms that the fund has invested in are also under scrutiny for their high risks for money-laundering. You might also like: Norway Central Bank to decide on digital currency recommendation next year Norwegian sovereign wealth fund’s Council of Ethics is tasked with probing companies the fund has invested in to ensure that they operate respectably from a business standpoint. If they do not, the council will recommend the fund to divest from those companies or place them on a public watch list. So far, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund has excluded 189 companies due to ethical violations, including aircraft manufacturing companies Airbus and Boeing for creating nuclear weapons as well as Glencore and RWE for producing coal or coal-based energy. Other reasons why the fund might decide to divest from companies include violations related to human rights, environmental damage, corruption and production of tobacco and canabis. The council is also going to investigate shoe manufacturers such as Nike, Adidas, Asics and Puma for potential violations regarding inhumane working conditions, ranging from long hours and low salaries to the workers’ inability to form unions. Even if the crypto firms listed in the fund aren’t found to have violated any money-laundering standards, those firms could very well be tried on the grounds of environmental damage. In April, Norwegian regulators introduced a new framework that would crack down on crypto mining in an attempt to limit or altogether eliminate crypto mining in the nation. Norway’s ministers have voiced their concerns in regards to the environmental impact of crypto mining, citing its greenhouse gas emissions as incompatible with Norway’s sustainability goals.

Digital asset institutional flows have moved upward in the last two months. These investors rallied in the positive sentiment around the market after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved Bitcoin ETFs. ETH funds saw inflows of $634 million, marking a turnaround as investors increased their appetites. The asset remains a top choice for firms due to its staking feature and the approval of its spot ETF products. At the moment, investors are setting sights on a bullish drive on the heels of ETF inflows. Although the ETH price failed to break multiple resistance levels like Bitcoin, an uptick is still within the grasp of bulls. Several analysts opine that Ethereum will eventually notch its bull run , similar to Bitcoin, which is leading the altcoin season. Decentralized finance (DeFi) numbers mark another positive attraction for investors. ETH monthly inflows stand at $1.4 billion, while total assets under management (AUM) move to $16.2 billion.

Each bet comprises a ""Yes"" and a ""No"" side. Each share pays out $1 in USDC, a stablecoin, or cryptocurrency that trades at par with the U.S. dollar, if the prediction comes true, and zero if not.  In October, a proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research urged Microsoft to add bitcoin to its balance sheet as a diversification investment, but the board recommended shareholders vote against it, arguing that crypto lacked the stability to be part of the treasury of a company the size of MSFT.  Saylor, the executive chairman of Microstrategy (MSTR), which has seen its stock rocket up 455% year-to-date, recently pitched Microsoft's board on this issue, arguing bitcoin could act as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, potentially boosting Microsoft’s $3.2 trillion market cap to over $8 trillion.  Microsoft's current treasury strategy, Saylor says, is weakening the company, as it has ""surrendered"" $200 billion in capital over five years through dividends and buybacks, which he argued could have been invested in Bitcoin, now up over 1,200% in that period.  One Polymarket bettor argued that there wasn't really a point for institutional investors to want Microsoft to add bitcoin to its balance sheet, because there are already so many options out there to get bitcoin exposure – which wasn't the case when Microstrategy originally bought.  ""They're just making their value assessment more difficult by muddying up safe investments (MFST) with volatile ones (BTC),"" trader Oxymirin wrote, who holds a position on the 'no' side worth $2000.  Another bettor, who holds the opposite side of the trade, argued that given Microsoft's comfortable cash position, the company might buy a small amount of BTC.  ""I think a small amount of funds will be allocated for testing. After all, shareholders' rights must be taken into consideration. Microsoft's cash position is sufficient. Microsoft offers some options for buying Bitcoin,"" a trader that goes by the handle of titanlin wrote.

Adding to the bullish sentiment, institutional interest has hit new highs. The $100 billion asset manager WisdomTree recently filed an S-1 application for a spot XRP ETF, a move that could open the floodgates for even more institutional capital. Such developments are fueling speculation that XRP’s utility is no longer just theoretical but a core component of the crypto industry’s future.

37168228,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373175,1733219406,"Massive Rally Fuels XRP Network: Over 22,000 New Wallets Created in a Day","XRP reclaimed its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization this week after a significant rally reinvigorating investor interest. The surge has not only boosted XRP’s market cap but also its network growth as seen with its increasing wallet count. XRP Network Growth Soars According to Santiment’s latest analysis , XRP has seen an impressive increase in network growth, with 22,357 new wallets created on Sunday alone, marking a notable milestone for the XRP Ledger. This uptick highlighted strong crowd engagement and growing utility amidst recent political shifts, stablecoin approval rumors, and ETF interest that appears to have pushed its market cap above $154 billion. While the influx of retail activity may lead to short-term price fluctuations, the long-term implications of such network expansion are promising for XRP’s adoption and sustainability. XRP has attracted fresh gains of more than 10% in the past 24 hours that briefly pushed its price above $2.60, but experts predict that a new peak is unlikely to transpire this year. In a statement to CryptoPotato , Arthur Azizov, CEO of B2BINPAY, said, “XRP was in an accumulation phase for nearly three years – around 900 days. The duration of such a phase often determines the strength of the subsequent rally, so it’s no surprise that from November 4, XRP has surged around 404%. It remains uncertain if it will be enough to push XRP to a new all-time high; an update to its ATH could potentially occur in the coming year.” Meanwhile, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju highlighted the critical role of Coinbase whales in driving XRP’s ongoing rally. Over the past 30 days, Coinbase’s minute-level price premium for XRP has ranged between 3% and 13%, highlighting significant buying activity by large investors on the platform. This contrasts sharply with Upbit, a major Korean exchange known for its strong XRP trading volumes, which has shown no significant premium during this surge. The disparity suggests that while Korean retail investors maintain steady interest, institutional players on Coinbase are likely the primary catalysts behind XRP’s recent momentum, shaping its price trajectory in the current market. SHIB, BAND Trails Behind XRP in Network Growth Several altcoins have followed XRP’s suit. For instance, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Band Protocol (BAND) recorded notable network growth over the weekend. SHIB recorded 7,548 new wallets, while BAND saw 35 new wallets, a remarkable increase relative to its usual activity levels. These surges in wallet creation reflect heightened interest and participation in their respective ecosystems. However, as with XRP, such network growth is accompanied by potential volatility.

XRP ETF filing #4… https://t.co/pekqC0Vcs6 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 2, 2024 Hopes Surge For U.S. XRP ETFs Under Trump Regime The ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC could delay XRP ETF applications from hitting Wall Street fast enough. In October, the SEC unleashed a last-minute appeal , challenging a July 2023 court ruling that found that XRP sales on secondary markets to investors did not qualify as securities transactions. Ripple filed its cross-appeal soon afterward in response to the SEC’s legal move. With SEC chair Gary Gensler on the way out as pro-crypto President-elect Trump assumes office, XRP backers believe that regulatory clarity is coming, and that will set the stage for a spot XRP ETF despite the ongoing appeal. And investor optimism is showing: WisdomTree’s filing comes as XRP’s price rockets. The asset hit a seven-year high price of $2.81 per coin on Monday. It’s now trading for $2.70, according to CoinGecko data, a 24-hour jump of over 32%.

37168061,https://coinpedia.org/?p=388438,1733219027,SEC Names XRP Lawsuit Leader Jorge Tenreiro as Chief Litigation Counsel,"The post SEC Names XRP Lawsuit Leader Jorge Tenreiro as Chief Litigation Counsel appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News While the entire crypto market buzzed last week that all previous crypto cases may drop, the SEC has plan B in action. SEC drops a bombshell by appointing Jorge Tenreiro to Chief Litigation Counsel, a move that signals the agency’s commitment to strict crypto oversight. Recently Tenreiro has updated his profile as SEC’s Chief Litigation Officer. Tenreiro is widely recognized for his aggressive enforcement tactics in the crypto space, and this promotion comes at a critical moment as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office. After the US selling Bitcoins, this major change in the SEC’s front is a sign that Trump’s presidential tenure to make crypto a leading investment asset in the US will not be easy. Here’s what it means for you! A Tough Enforcer for Crypto Tenreiro’s track record with the SEC underscores his approach to crypto regulation. Previously, he led the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, where he oversaw some of the SEC’s most contentious cases. His role in the Ripple lawsuit, where the SEC alleged XRP was an unregistered security, solidified his reputation as a key figure in shaping crypto enforcement. He also supervised cases that resulted in a $30 million settlement with Kraken and initiated legal action against Coinbase, two of the most significant crypto exchanges in the U.S. What Tenreiro’s Promotion Means for Crypto Notably, this promotion gives Tenreiro even more authority, making him a central figure in deciding how the SEC handles upcoming crypto cases. Despite hopes for more favorable regulations under Trump’s administration, Tenreiro’s appointment suggests the SEC won’t ease up on its hardline approach. His focus will likely remain on enforcing securities laws, targeting token offerings, ICOs, and market manipulation, and ensuring compliance across the board. Community Reaction Prominent crypto lawyer John E. Deaton has voiced strong criticism of Jorge Tenreiro, the newly appointed Chief Litigation Counsel at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Responding to a post by Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty, Deaton labeled Tenreiro as the prime example of a lawyer crypto firms should avoid hiring. Alderoty had earlier urged the crypto community to distance itself from attorneys involved in SEC lawsuits against crypto firms or those who supported such legal actions. The remarks highlight growing tensions between the SEC and the crypto industry as debates over regulatory approaches and enforcement actions intensify. Ripple Case Sets the Tone In this regard, the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit remains a landmark case, not just for Ripple but for the entire industry. If the SEC wins, it could set a precedent for treating many cryptocurrencies as securities, subjecting them to stricter regulations. On the other hand, a Ripple victory could force the SEC to rethink its strategy. Tenreiro’s leadership in this case and others like it will be crucial in defining how crypto will be sustained in the U.S. For the crypto industry, this new chapter is a mixed bag. While regulatory clarity under Trump could boost innovation, Tenreiro’s leadership shows that companies can still expect a watchful eye from the SEC.",NEGATIVE,XRP,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP | TOKEN SALE,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/sec-names-xrp-lawsuit-leader-jorge-tenreiro-as-chief-litigation-counsel/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37168083,https://coinpaper.com/6346/south-korean-crypto-trading-volumes-soar-outpacing-stock-market,1733219025,"South Korean Crypto Trading Volumes Soar, Outpacing Stock Market","South Kora’s crypto trading volume boom also surpassed the nation’s stock market by 22% on the same day. Ripple’s XRP led the altcoin rally by soaring to a yearly high of $2.80. Other altcoins like DOGE, XLM, ENS, and HBAR also saw impressive gains. This increased activity coincided with South Korea’s decision to delay crypto taxation until 2027. Meanwhile, DWF Labs announced its relocation to Abu Dhabi to expand its Web3 footprint, and Coinbase withdrew its application to enter Turkey’s growing crypto market. South Korean Investors Dive Into Altcoins South Korea's crypto market experienced a remarkable surge after retail trading volumes reached $18 billion in 24 hours. This allowed the crypto market to outpace the nation’s entire stock market by 22%, according to a Dec. 2 report by 10x Research. Markus Thielen, the founder of 10x Research, shared that this was the second-highest trading volume of the year for South Korean retail investors, driven largely by high-momentum altcoins. Among the standout performers, Ripple’s XRP accounted for about $6.3 billion of the trading volume, followed by Dogecoin (DOGE) at $1.6 billion, Stellar (XLM) at $1.3 billion, Ethereum Name Service (ENS) at $900 million, and Hedera (HBAR) at $800 million. Thielen noticed that these tokens, which are often referred to as “dino coins” by crypto natives because of their longstanding presence in the market, saw big gains over the past week. XRP, ENS , and HBAR surged by about 89%, 74%, and 152%, respectively. BTC funding rate vs Korea crypto trading volumes (Source: 10xResearch ) The report also shed some light on a divergence between Bitcoin's relatively mild funding rate, sitting at 15% annualized, and the explosive trading activity in altcoins. Thielen interpreted this as a strong indicator that the crypto market entered an ”alt season,” where momentum-driven trends dominate trading. Ripple’s XRP has been at the forefront of this rally after it climbed from $0.50 to a new yearly high of $2.80 in just a month. This growth propelled XRP to become the third-largest crypto asset by market cap after it jumped past both Solana (SOL) and Tether (USDT). XRP’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) South Korea Delays Crypto Tax to 2027 The rise in altcoin trading may be related to the news that South Korea's crypto tax launch was delayed yet again, and is now set to take effect in January of 2027. The decision was announced after lawmakers reached an agreement to postpone the measure for an additional two years. The ruling People’s Power Party (PPP) secured the delay despite opposition from the Democratic Party (DP), which wanted to amend the tax plan. The DP's proposal to raise the annual tax threshold for crypto traders to 50 million won (or approximately $36,000) failed to gain traction, and left the government’s original amendment intact. DP floor leader Park Chan-dae announced the agreement at a Dec. 1 press conference , and mentioned that there is a need for more institutional preparation before taxing crypto traders. Park’s comments agreed with earlier statements from DP leader Lee Jae-myung, who argued that crypto taxation was not yet systematically feasible. The decision now allows the DP to redirect its focus to other legislative battles, including the taxation of dividend income and inheritance tax reforms. Park Chan-dae speaking at the Dec.1 press conference This latest delay was the third time South Korea’s crypto tax was postponed since lawmakers initially approved it in December of 2020. It was originally set to launch in January of 2021, but the tax’s implementation was first pushed back to January 2023, then to January 2025, and now to 2027. The DP recently tried to adhere to the 2025 timeline while raising the tax threshold to align with stock market trading rules, claiming that the majority of investors would avoid taxation under their proposal. However, the PPP resisted these efforts and prevented the rival bill from moving forward. The repeated delays caused a lot of frustration among South Korean crypto traders. One investor even called the situation a “complete mess” and blamed both the government and opposition for poor handling of the issue. However, many crypto investors still welcome the tax postponement. Abu Dhabi Becomes DWF Labs' New Home Crypto is making headlines in other countries as well. Well known Web3 venture capitalist and crypto market maker, DWF Labs, announced plans to relocate its headquarters to Abu Dhabi, UAE. The move was confirmed by founder and CEO Andrei Grachev on X, and its main goal will be to improve the firm's involvement in real-world assets (RWA) and to expand financial services across the Middle East. The company's structure already includes regional offices in Singapore, Dubai, and Switzerland. Both Abu Dhabi and Dubai, which are both part of the UAE, have been competing to attract businesses by offering unique regulatory frameworks and economic zones. DWF Labs is currently listed as an ecosystem partner of Dubai’s Crypto Centre in the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC), which houses a number of major crypto companies like Bybit, Solana, and Binance. Ripple also operates in the UAE from the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). Here it benefits from tailored digital asset regulations introduced earlier this year. Abu Dhabi’s virtual asset ecosystem is concentrated in the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), which is a financial hub known for its independent legal framework based on English law and its progressive crypto regulations. It was first introduced in 2018. The ADGM also recently adopted comprehensive DLT Foundations Regulations in 2023. Companies like Blockdaemon, M2, Laser Digital, and even traditional financial giants like BlackRock have established operations there. DWF Labs emerged in 2022 as an offshoot of a high-frequency trading firm, and boasts an impressive portfolio that is valued between $72 billion and $77 billion. It also consists of over 700 projects. Coinbase Abandons Turkish Crypto Expansion Plans Meanwhile, Coinbase withdrew its pre-application to enter the Turkish crypto market, according to documents released by the Turkish Capital Markets Board (CMB). The company initially joined more than 90 other enterprises seeking entry into Turkey’s growing crypto market but now requested a liquidation of its application. The reasons behind Coinbase’s decision have not been revealed yet. A Coinbase spokesperson stated that the company routinely evaluates markets for expansion, and mentioned that its strategy is guided by market conditions, regulatory environments, and internal priorities. This aligns with Coinbase’s mission to deliver accessible and secure crypto services globally. Coinbase applied for entry into the Turkish market in August, and joined other well known crypto firms like KuCoin and Gate.io. However, by the end of November, at least 14 companies, including Coinbase and Bitget, withdrew their applications. Despite these withdrawals, Turkey is still a major player in the crypto space.

IOTA ( IOTA ) rose 46% in the last 24 hours to a six-month high of $0.504, bringing its market cap past $1.7 billion at press time. The gains extended its monthly gains to over 350% while its daily trading volume jumped 83,% hovering over $705 million at the time of writing. The altcoin’s recent price rally was supported by a jump in futures open interest. According to CoinGlass , open interest in the futures market hit a record high of $87.89 million, up over three times from last week’s low of $26.27 million. Why is IOTA rising? IOTA rallied after developers opened the voting process to upgrade the IOTA L1 mainnet to the new Rebased protocol . https://twitter.com/iota/status/1863583910510092773 Rebased is IOTA’s largest upgrade to date, introducing multiple features such as the ability to earn IOTA staking rewards, an initial target inflation rate between 6% and 7%, support for deploying Move-based smart contracts, and full decentralization of the IOTA ledger. IOTA rebased upgrade is expected to reduce transaction costs, introduce an adaptive fee-burning mechanism, and implement sponsored transactions to abstract transaction fees. The voting process for the Rebased upgrade will last for seven days, concluding on Dec. 9, while the counting process will take an additional seven days, ending on Dec. 16. IOTA’s rally comes as the altcoin market is gaining momentum, as evidenced by the Altcoin Season Index at 81, indicating that many altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. This surge aligns with heightened optimism in the cryptocurrency market, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index reaching 76, signaling strong bullish sentiment prevailing in the market.

After IOTA’s recent surge, analysts now predict more gains for the altcoin According to pseudo-anonymous analysts Team LAMBO Charts, IOTA has broken out of a large falling wedge pattern, a bullish signal in technical analysis, and has also breached a major resistance level at $0.40. They predict the altcoin could surge to $0.70 in the short term, followed by a rally to $1 , with a much more bullish mid-term target of $2.60—which would represent a 430% hike from the current price level. Meanwhile, another market commentator observed that IOTA has broken out after two years of accumulation. He anticipates further gains for the altcoin as whales start rotating recent profits from other altcoins into IOTA. Sharing a three-day price chart, he predicted that IOTA could rise to $3.50, provided it successfully breaches the $1 level in the short term. IOTA could pullback before its next move IOTA price, 50-day and 200-day EMA — Dec. 3 | Source: crypto.news On the daily chart, IOTA has moved above both the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages at $0.1914 and $0.1710, respectively, which have recently formed a golden cross, which can mean a major upside for the altcoin in the near future. IOTA RSI and Stochastic Oscillator chart — Dec. 3 | Source: crypto.news However, the Relative Strength Index and the Stochastic Oscillator have reached overbought levels, suggesting that a pullback is likely. Therefore, the altcoin could retreat to retest the support at $0.30 before resuming its upward rally. The next major resistance is at $1, a level IOTA failed to breach on two consecutive attempts in 2022. A breakout above this resistance could propel the altcoin to retest $1.49, its peak from December 2021.

37167950,https://crypto.news/?p=14315721,1733218627,Santiment: FOMO unlikely to hinder further market growth,"A recent analysis by the market intelligence platform Santiment suggests that FOMO might not disrupt the current bullish trend in the cryptocurrency market. Despite massive rallies across the market, the report from Santiment spotlights a surprising level of neutrality in market sentiment, which could allow continued growth as the uptrend matures. https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1863843202886672675 Notably, over the past 30 days, major altcoins like Stellar ( XLM ), XRP ( XRP ) and Cardano ( ADA ) have experienced record-breaking gains. Stellar surged by an impressive 512%, XRP rose 444%, and Cardano increased by 280% over the last month, respectively. Market participants have observed these dramatic price movements, yet euphoria has noticeably cooled after a wave of profit-taking in late November. For context, this profit-taking wave dominated the scene after Bitcoin ( BTC ), the industry’s firstborn, attempted to breach the $100,000 mark. The bearish trend led to a retracement for BTC and the rest of the market, but a recovery has since ensued. You might also like: Over $9m lost in November phishing scams affecting 9.2k victims, data shows Despite the recovery, Santiment’s findings show that the hype surrounding these assets has not transitioned into widespread FOMO. Retail traders appear to have stepped back after capitalizing on earlier gains, leading to a quieter atmosphere. Historically, market trends often move contrary to prevailing trader sentiment. Santiment suggests that the current lack of retail enthusiasm is a positive indicator for further market climbs. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju confirmed this trend last month. The reduced noise surrounding top-performing assets implies that the market could experience sustained upward momentum without the volatility often driven by FOMO-induced buying. This period of neutrality in trader sentiment syncs with historical patterns in which quieter periods have preceded bullish moves. Interestingly, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson believes BTC could still witness further growth to $500,000, possibly benefiting the rest of the market. Market veteran Michaël van de Poppe holds this sentiment, stressing in a recent analysis that the ongoing bull run is not yet over. A great chart. This bull market is far from over. It did start recently and $XRP sparked the fire. I expect similar returns to be happening on the #Altcoins , but I also expected this entire market to 10x in the upcoming year. We've just started. pic.twitter.com/vcii92JxfM — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) December 2, 2024 He noted that, as XRP has triggered the bullish uptrend in the altcoin market, the scene could witness a further 10x growth next year.

37168090,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=621825,1733218599,Trump says Canada could become US’s 51st state if his tariffs crush its economy,"Donald Trump’s dinner meetings are never boring, but his recent one with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at Mar-a-Lago might go down in history as the most audacious. Between the high-end steak and well-aged wine, Trump reportedly suggested that Canada should consider becoming the 51st state of the United States if it can’t manage its economy under his looming 25% tariffs. “If your country can’t survive unless it’s ripping off the U.S. to the tune of $100 billion, maybe it should become a state.” – Donald Trump With three-fourths of Canada’s exports dependent on the U.S. market, Trump’s threat was a potential death knell for Canada’s economy, forcing the Canadian leader to start scrambling for solutions. Tariffs: Economic warfare or a dealbreaker? Trump has never hidden his disdain for trade deficits or what he calls “unfair trade practices.” So of course he wants protectionist trade policies. That’s the America First agenda. His latest salvo—a proposed 25% tariff on Canadian goods—was positioned as a response to perceived failures by Canada to control drug smuggling and illegal migration across their shared border. Roughly 75% of Canada’s exports head south of the border, making the U.S. its lifeline. Economists estimate that these tariffs could slash Canada’s GDP by 2.4% within two years and eliminate up to 1.5 million jobs. The Canadian economy could spiral, with effects likely hitting industries ranging from lumber to automotive manufacturing. Trudeau , caught between a rock and a hard place, argued that such tariffs would backfire, hurting U.S. consumers as much as Canadian producers. “These tariffs would kill our industries,” Trudeau reportedly said, emphasizing that costs for American citizens would inevitably rise. Essential goods like timber, steel, and even groceries could see price hikes, making Trump’s tariff plan a political gamble on both sides of the border. Dominic LeBlanc, Canada’s Public Safety Minister, labeled Trump’s strategy as “reckless” in Canadian Parliament. “This isn’t just about Canada,” he said. “The U.S. would face supply chain disruptions, higher prices, and industrial slowdowns.” Trump says Trudeau could be Governor Trump’s latest comments, though humorous on the surface, carried a chilling undertone. For a nation as proud of its sovereignty as Canada, the remark was nothing short of incendiary. The US president went even further, offering Trudeau a hypothetical deal: retain his title as prime minister but also take on the role of governor if Canada were absorbed into the U.S. The statement reeked of provocation, which Trudeau countered with a pointed response. While refraining from escalating the rhetoric, he made it clear that Canada wouldn’t entertain such notions. “Canada is a sovereign nation,” Trudeau reportedly said, maintaining a calm but firm tone. Yet behind closed doors, Canadian officials are undoubtedly calculating the potential fallout of a prolonged economic standoff. Implications on the global economy If Trump’s tariffs become a reality, the consequences will stretch far beyond Canada, or even China and Mexico. Economists warn that global financial markets will be caught in the crossfire too. The World Bank estimates that tariffs on this scale could knock global GDP growth down by at least 0.5%, dragging major economies into slower recovery trajectories after years of pandemic-driven uncertainty. Meanwhile, with its own trade relationship with the U.S. already strained, China could be affected as North American tariffs disrupt global commodity flows. At the same time, Canada is exploring diversification strategies, seeking to reduce its dependence on the U.S. market. Trade agreements with the European Union and Pacific nations are back on the table as potential lifelines, though economists warn such shifts will take years to materialize.

Users must do their own research before taking any actions related to the company. Cardano breaks $1 for the first time since 2022 amid bullish momentum, while memeFi token Cutoshi emerges as a high-upside alternative. Table of Contents Cardano sees huge gains Can Cutoshi reach $1 from its current $0.0259 level? With the crypto market riding the bullish wave, Cardano is seeing some major gains. The token has reached multi-year highs, breaking $1 for the first time since 2022. However, there’s a new token, Cutoshi , that is seen as a promising alternative with significant upside. Cardano sees huge gains Cardano (ADA) has been one of the strongest performers this cycle. Currently in 8th place among crypto assets, the token saw a 239.59% increase in the last 30 days. Cardano is currently a multi-year of $1.20, boosted by major developments in the markets. The crypto bull rally has been one of the main contributors to Cardano’s rise. However, what was even more impactful was what was driving the bull rally. Notably, Cardano is one of the tokens that stands to benefit the most from the coming major shifts in US regulations. Source: CMC Most recently, traders are bracing for potential Cardano spot ETFs in the United States. So far, the SEC’s Gary Gensler was a major roadblock for that development. The SEC Chair was reluctant to approve spot altcoin ETFs, citing high risks and potential for manipulation. However, with his resignation, the agency is likely to take a new course. What is more, the incoming US administration will likely be much more favorable to crypto regulation. As an established project, Cardano stands to benefit a lot from the regulatory change. With regulatory clarity, institutions are likely to pour new capital into credible projects like Cardano. This is also reflected in the technical analysis of the token. Momentum indicators all suggest a strong buy, with moving averages trading far below Cardano’s current price . This suggests a strong outlook for Cardano in the near future. Can Cutoshi reach $1 from its current $0.0259 level? Cardano is a strong contender in the crypto space. However, investors who are opting for high-risk, high-reward plays are looking at Cutoshi (CUTO) as an alternative. This memeFi token is attracting attention from traders who value a strong technical foundation and utility. This combination is proving strong, as Cutoshi reached $1.2 million in presale investments in December. Cutoshi is a token that combines memecoins with DeFi. Its mascot is the Chinese Lucky Cat, a symbol that is recognized throughout the world. At the same time, its inspiration is Satoshi Nakamoto, the legendary Bitcoin creator. Like Satoshi, Cutoshi is focused on decentralization and digital freedom. At the heart of its mission is creating a decentralized ecosystem run by its users. Its multichain DEX wants to make DeFi more accessible than ever, offering a secure way for investors to handle their crypto. Security is key, as DEXs enable traders to retain the custody of their coins, securing them from misuse. If Cutoshi succeeds in its mission, it has the potential to join the top 200, or even 100, crypto projects. At current prices, this would mean it has a real shot at $1. Currently trading at $0.031, the bullish case for the token would mean a significant upside. To learn more about Cutoshi, visit the official website.

This represents a notable 31.1% increase in its circulating market cap quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) compared to Q2. The XRP price also experienced a significant increase of 28.5% during the same period. However, with the recent victory of President-elect Donald Trump and a clearer horizon on the regulatory front in the US, these metrics have fallen short, with the last three weeks’ rally being the largest in nearly 7 years. XRP Sees 94% Surge In Daily Transactions Research firm Messari and its Q3 report show that the recent momentum can be attributed to several key developments. Most notably, asset management firm Grayscale launched its XRP Trust in September, giving accredited investors a new way to gain exposure to XRP. This development, along with S-1 filings by exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers Bitwise, Canary, 21Shares and WisdomTree to launch XRP ETFs in recent months, underscores the growing institutional interest in the token. Related Reading: Cardano Could Be Heading For A 20% Correction – Technical Data Signals Bearish Price Structure In Q3, several key network metrics reversed previous declines. Average daily transactions soared by 94% QoQ to reach 1.7 million, while new addresses increased by 10% to 105,000. However, the increase was largely driven by microtransactions (transactions involving less than 1 XRP), which Ripple’s report noted were associated with a spam messaging campaign. Notably, this increase in new addresses contrasts with a 34% year-over-year decline in quarterly new addresses from Q3 2023 to Q2 2024. Despite the uptick in certain metrics, total active addresses fell by 3% QoQ, driven by a 20% decrease in active sending addresses, while unique receiving addresses rose by 7%. Price Nears 2018 Record High Payment transactions also displayed remarkable growth, increasing by 110% QoQ after experiencing declines in the previous two quarters. This surge followed a significant spike related to inscription activities that began at the end of 2023. In addition to payment transactions, NFT-related activities on the XRPL also saw notable changes. NFT minting and burning transactions increased by 93% and 148%, respectively, while NFT creation and offer acceptance transactions saw slight declines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $245,000? Here’s When You Should Be Expecting It Despite this, if going deeper into the Q4 data, XRP has seen its most notable uptrend in years, with its market capitalization soaring by nearly $130 billion in just three weeks, making it the third largest digital asset on the market, just behind Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Its price has clearly followed suit, with a colossal 432% uptrend in the past few weeks to a current trading price of $2,71 per token, close to the record high of $3,040 reached during the 2018 bull run, and now with only a 20% gap between the current price and the all-time high. Overall, the data from Q3 and part of Q4 paints a picture of a growing and evolving XRP ecosystem characterized by increased transaction activity, institutional interest, and a commitment to improving XRP’s value proposition.

""This outcome is crucial for all onchain activity,"" wrote analyst Mads Eberhardt.  The surge has led to higher staking rewards and more ether (ETH) being burned via transaction fees, the report said.  ""This combination strengthen's Ethereum's tokenomics,"" Steno said, making ether a more appealing asset.  Steno noted that the amount of USDT on the Ethereum network surpassed supply on the Tron blockchain for the first time in more than two years. This is a clear sign that on-chain activity is booming, resulting in greater demand for ether to facilitate transactions and higher transactional revenue.  The number of daily transactions on Ethereum layer-2 networks, or rollups, is also growing, and Steno said it expects this upward trend to continue.  Rollups are Ethereum protocols that process transactions separately from the main network to help increase speed and lower costs. Layer 2s are separate blockchains built on top of layer 1s, or the base layer, that reduce bottlenecks with scaling and data.  The daily fees the rollups pay to Ethereum are not transformative at the moment, but Steno said it is not unrealistic to estimate that they could reach $1 million, and when this happens it will be a meaningful addition to the network's economics.  Ether spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. recorded their largest one-day net inflow to date on Friday, and surpassed bitcoin (BTC) versions for the first time, the report noted.

I hope you all are fine! Here is the weekly update on $XRP . People began to believe in XRP after our first target was eliminated at $1.88. Fibonacci's level stands at $5.85. People started copying our targets, but never mind—we have known their precision for almost… pic.twitter.com/J52Aj5a51C — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) December 2, 2024 Chart Analysis and Price Targets The attached chart highlights a five-wave Elliott Wave structure, indicating that XRP is in the middle of a bull cycle. The analyst points out that the first major target at $1.88 has already been reached, with Fibonacci retracement and extension levels marking the next critical price points. Specifically, the Fibonacci extension suggests $5.85 as the next milestone, while a more extended rally could drive XRP toward $18.22. Dark Defender has predicted a rise to the $18.22 target multiple times. He highlighted key support levels at $1.88 and $2.13, providing strong price floors for XRP during potential corrections. The Ichimoku cloud on the weekly chart further supports the bullish outlook, as XRP has decisively broken above the cloud—a signal of sustained upward momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), shown on the chart, reflects overbought conditions. While this typically hints at a potential pullback, the ongoing trend suggests that bullish sentiment may sustain further gains, provided market conditions remain favorable. Recent Price Performance and Market Status XRP recently reached a peak of $2.8487, marking a significant 22.9% increase in just 24 hours. This surge comes after surpassing its 2021 high of $1.96, a milestone many market analysts, including Peter Brandt, identified as a gateway to a substantial rally .

We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP is currently the third-largest cryptocurrency in the market, and many prominent figures have predicted that it can surpass Ethereum in this cycle, regaining its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency. XRP’s recent performance and adherence to the outlined five-wave structure suggest that the cryptocurrency is well-positioned for further growth. While near-term support levels at $1.88 and $2.13 provide a solid foundation, Fibonacci targets of $5.85 and $18.22 represent significant opportunities for XRP in the long run. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently reminisced on when XRP held the second position in the market. With the digital asset vastly outperforming Ethereum recently, it might achieve this goal.

Notably, even the indication that a gigantic Bitcoin whale such as a government is about to dump large amounts of the premier crypto is enough to send markets tumbling. Inside US Government’s Latest BTC Transfer According to data from on-chain intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence, a wallet tagged as “U.S. Government: Silk Road DOJ Confiscated Funds” sent some 19,800 BTC, worth around $1.92 billion, to a Coinbase Prime deposit address. U.S. authorities confiscated the BTC in a 2021 investigation of James Zhong, who last year pleaded guilty to wire fraud related to the Silk Road marketplace. Zhong manipulated the Silk Road transaction system in 2012 to steal 50,676 Bitcoins. The Department of Justice seized the stash in 2022 after BTC’s price had surged significantly, making it one of the biggest Bitcoin seizures in history. The Monday transfer likely signals that the government is preparing to sell the assets. Previous transfers by the Feds have triggered substantial sell-offs in Bitcoin. The BTC price is now up 0.4% over a 24-hour period, according to CoinGecko. Its price hovers at $95,389 at the publication time. The US government still held roughly $18 billion worth of Bitcoin at the time of writing this, meaning it is the largest geopolitical holder of the flagship cryptocurrency. U.S. Government Selling Its Bitcoin Holdings Is A “Huge Strategic Mistake” Crypto industry observers quickly reacted to the U.S. government’s decision to shift almost $2B in BTC to Coinbase. “This is a huge strategic mistake,” wrote Jason Lowery, the author of Softwar: A Novel Theory on Power Projection and the National Strategic Significance of Bitcoin. “There is no price where it makes sense for the US to sell any Bitcoin it has under its control. They have no idea what they own, and it shows.” Lowery added: “Remember this post when they inevitably try to justify a new version of EO 6102 to reclaim the Bitcoin they sold off due to their ignorance about the true significance of this technology.” For those unaware, EO 6102 authorized President Franklin D. Roosevelt to force American citizens to relinquish their gold coins, gold bullion, and gold certificates. The executive order was implemented so that the U.S. government could devalue the dollar more aggressively to stimulate the economy during the Great Depression. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong agreed with Lowery, noting that the government shouldn’t dump its BTC. Notably, US lawmakers like Senator Cynthia Lummis and the incoming president Donald Trump, have proposed passing legislation to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the United States. The Wyoming Republican officially introduced the Bitcoin Act in August for the government to purchase 1 million BTC — approximately 5% of the total circulating supply — for five years to match the country’s gold reserves.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/market-crash-coming-us-government-transfers-nearly-2-billion-in-silk-road-bitcoin-to-coinbase/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png
37167657,https://coinpedia.org/?p=388421,1733217925,Altcoins Surge 600%: Is This the Calm Before the Next Explosion?,"The post Altcoins Surge 600%: Is This the Calm Before the Next Explosion? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market’s been on fire lately, right? Since November 5, when Bitcoin kicked off its rally during the US elections, it’s been a wild ride. But what’s really interesting isn’t just Bitcoin—Ripple’s XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Stellar (XLM) have been climbing fast, too. The total market cap hit a whopping $3.48 trillion, leaving investors thinking, “Wait, could this rally keep going?” Let’s dive in and take a closer look at what’s happening with these altcoins. XRP’s Back—But Can It Keep Climbing? XRP is on a roll. It’s up a huge 467% since November 5, jumping all the way to $2.87, a price we haven’t seen since January 2018. While it’s still 31% below its all-time high, this is a major comeback. The token has been making waves, with a 17.64% price increase in the last 24 hours and trading volume surging by 36.12%. It’s even back to being the #3 cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap. But here’s the thing—XRP might still have some room to grow. Could it eventually break its all-time high? Time will tell, but altcoins’ rally is definitely one to watch. ADA and XLM: Not Far Behind Cardano (ADA) has also been turning heads, rising 307% to $1.32 since early November. The latest stats show 79% of ADA holders are making a profit, though it’s still 59% below its ATH of $3.10. But, hey, Cardano’s fundamentals are strong, and that’s why investors are still excited about this crypto. Then there’s Stellar (XLM), which has really stolen the show with a 607% surge since November 5. The price is still 42% below its ATH, but a 27% increase in trading volume in just 24 hours shows that people are paying attention. What’s Next? So, after all these huge gains, the crypto market’s taking a bit of a breather. A lot of investors are locking in profits, which has led to a bit of stagnation. It’s easy to think the rally might be over, but historically, this is just the market cooling off before it can take off again. Santiment , through a post on X, shared that trader fatigue is starting to set in, and retail activity is slowing down. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, though. It could be a sign that FOMO (fear of missing out) is out of the picture, which means more room for growth. Markets tend to surprise us, and sometimes, the quiet phases are the setup for the next big move. So, what’s going to happen next? It’s hard to say for sure, but the crypto world is unpredictable. Get ready, because this might just be the calm before another storm of gains for altcoins.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/altcoins-surge-600-is-this-the-calm-before-the-next-explosion/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

The month’s major losses demonstrated the scammers’ sophisticated approach, with incidents including a $409,000 WBTC theft on Arbitrum, a $344,000 FET exploitation through Uniswap Permit2, and a $220,000 USDT direct transfer attack. November total losses account for $9.38 million The total losses for November reached $9.38 million. This marks a substantial 53% decrease from October’s $20.2 million and an even greater decline from September’s $45.8 million. However, the persistently high victim count of 9,208 indicates that attackers continue to successfully target cryptocurrency users. 🧵 [1/7] 🚨 ScamSniffer November Phishing Report $9,380,000 STOLEN 9,208 VICTIMS November saw one victim lose $661K in stETH within minutes – and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Let's dive into the dark side of Web3… 🧵 pic.twitter.com/HDyBGh5tPj — Scam Sniffer | Web3 Anti-Scam (@realScamSniffer) December 3, 2024 Scam Sniffer stated that a major development in the cybersecurity sector was the transition from Inferno Drainer to Angel Drainer. As Scam Sniffer notes, this evolution demonstrates the “hydra-like” nature of crypto threats. This is when one attack vector is neutralized, and new ones quickly emerge to take its place. Immunefi reports $71 million lost in November The findings align with broader industry data from Immunefi , which reported total losses of $71 million to hacks and rug pulls in November 2024. This represents a 79% decrease from the same period last year. The DeFi sector proved particularly vulnerable, accounting for all reported losses. Some of the major incidents are the Thala Labs’ $25.5 million hack and the DEXX platform’s $21 million loss. The year-to-date losses for 2024 stand at $1.48 billion, showing a 15% improvement compared to 2023. This trend suggests that while large-scale attacks are becoming less successful, individual users remain vulnerable to sophisticated phishing attempts and signature-based exploits. Scam Sniffer emphasizes critical security practices, providing a clear defense guide for users: “NEVER rush to sign transactions. Verify ALL signature requests,” the platform warns, emphasizing that “One wrong signature = Empty wallet. Think twice, sign once.” While the decrease in monthly losses suggests improving security measures and growing awareness, the high victim count indicates persistent vulnerabilities in user security practices. The contrast between falling total losses and steady victim numbers suggests attackers may be shifting toward higher-frequency, lower-value targets. The centralized finance (CeFi) sector showed improved resilience with no major reported incidents in November. However, DeFi platforms continued to face challenges.

According to a December 2 report by 10x Research, this marked the second-highest trading day of the year for crypto in South Korea, driven by retail investors’ interest in high-momentum altcoins. Ripple’s XRP emerged as the star of the day, recording over $6.3 billion in trading volumes. Other prominent tokens included Dogecoin (DOGE) at $1.6 billion, Stellar (XLM) at $1.3 billion, Ethereum Name Service (ENS) at $900 million, and Hedera (HBAR) at $800 million. The report highlights that these volumes reflect retail traders’ propensity to capitalize on short-term momentum, amplifying trends and injecting fresh enthusiasm into the market. Interestingly, these altcoins, often referred to as “dino coins” by crypto enthusiasts, have delivered remarkable returns in recent weeks. XRP has soared by 90%, ENS by 73%, and HBAR by a staggering 168%, outperforming broader market trends. XRP Rally Redefines Market Rankings Ripple’s XRP is at the forefront of South Korea’s crypto frenzy, setting a new yearly high of $2.80 on December 2. This impressive performance has propelled XRP to surpass Solana (SOL) and Tether (USDT) in market capitalization, making it the third-largest cryptocurrency globally. According to TradingView data, XRP’s price has climbed from $0.50 in early November, reflecting an extraordinary rally over just one month. The report’s author, Markus Thielen, attributes the surge to altseason dynamics—a market phase characterized by significant interest and trading activity in alternative cryptocurrencies, overshadowing Bitcoin. Thielen observed that Bitcoin’s funding rate, a metric often linked to perpetual futures activity, was “relatively mild” at 15% annualized, further signaling the shifting focus toward altcoins. “This divergence between subdued Bitcoin activity and skyrocketing altcoin trading volumes underscores the importance of strategic discipline in navigating the altcoin market,” Thielen noted. Market Implications of High Trading Volumes The surge in crypto activity reflects a growing appetite among South Korean retail investors for altcoins, particularly those with high volatility and potential for rapid gains. However, experts caution against over-leveraging during such momentum-driven phases, urging traders to remain cautious. As South Korea continues to lead in retail crypto engagement , the market dynamics are likely to fuel discussions about regulation and innovation within the country’s burgeoning cryptocurrency landscape. For now, the spotlight remains firmly on altcoins, with traders riding the wave of an explosive altseason.

37167231,https://coinpedia.org/?p=388414,1733216866,Is France’s New Tax on “Unproductive Wealth” a Threat to Bitcoin’s Price?,"The post Is France’s New Tax on “Unproductive Wealth” a Threat to Bitcoin’s Price? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News France is shaking up the crypto world by considering a new tax on “unproductive wealth.” This includes Bitcoin, along with luxury assets like yachts, private jets, and high-end cars. So, what does this mean for Bitcoin’s price ? Will this new tax make cryptocurrency less appealing to investors? France’s Proposed Tax on “Unproductive Wealth” The French government is exploring a bold move to tax “unproductive wealth,” a term that targets assets that don’t directly generate income. This list now includes Bitcoin, alongside other non-productive luxury items such as private jets, yachts, and luxury cars. Historically, wealthy individuals have used these assets as a way to preserve and grow their wealth. However, France’s new proposal aims to change that by placing a tax burden on them. The idea behind this tax is straightforward, if an asset doesn’t directly contribute to the economy or produce income, it should be taxed more heavily. This plan has sparked controversy, with many arguing that it could discourage investment in both digital assets like Bitcoin and traditional luxury items. Meanwhile, the plan is still under discussion, but it could make holding such assets more expensive for French citizens. How Will This Affect Bitcoin? Bitcoin, as a decentralized asset that doesn’t generate income, fits into this category. The government’s focus on taxing Bitcoin could lead to decreased demand, as investors might shy away from purchasing or holding the digital currency due to the potential tax burden. If this tax goes ahead, this would result in lower liquidity which might cause some short-term price drops, but it could also lead to more regulation of Bitcoin in other countries. Bitcoin Price Update In November Bitcoin achieved a historic monthly gain, adding $26,400 to its value and closing at an impressive $96,400.

42373254,01b0ef93-18ec-40b3-ae1f-fed0f2f878de,1733216400,Crypto Cash Fueled 53 Members of the Next U.S. Congress,"This is the first in a series of stories examining the crypto industry's high-stakes 2024 foray into politics and campaigning.  With the last few congressional elections finally called, the score card is in, and the crypto industry's effort to steer policy with cash has resulted in a 91% success rate in U.S. election battles for the sector's favored candidates.  Of the 58 races that the industry's Fairshake political action committee and its affiliates focused on in the elections last month, just five candidates lost. The result: A large segment of the Senate and House of Representatives will have the industry to thank for significant backing — in some cases, money that likely tipped the balance.  In January, they'll head to Capitol Hill, where a significant block of crypto support has already been digging in — partially thanks to the previous congressional elections in 2022 in which Fairshake's predecessor, GMI PAC Inc., conducted a similar strategy, though that was significantly smaller.  Congress is famously difficult to wrangle into producing complex legislation, such as the regulation package called for by the U.S. cryptocurrency sector, but the dozens of members potentially closely aligned with the industry could help unstick the crypto bills. President-elect Donald Trump has also promised his executive branch will embrace the financial innovations, putting the two branches into alignment in 2025.  How did the industry get here? Unprecedented campaign contributions and a politically expedient strategy that didn't wear its crypto enthusiasm openly.  Modern U.S. election laws allow for corporations to spend as much as they'd like to run ads for their chosen candidates, so three of the top names in the industry — Coinbase Inc. (COIN), Ripple Labs and investment firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) — piled up the largest mound of cash any single industry devoted to the 2024 elections. It was primarily those three companies putting together the $169 million war chest, with some additional millions added by other firms and individuals.  It marked the boldest corporate incursion into campaign finance since the U.S. Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling cleared a path for businesses to make unlimited independent ad buys to support or oppose candidates, as long as the activity isn't directly tied to the campaigns. The Fairshake super PAC and its affiliates — Protect Progress for its Democrat recipients and Defend American Jobs for its Republican spending — focused only on congressional races and not the presidency.  For crypto, the top priority in Washington is the passage of new laws to regulate the space and eliminate questions in the minds of hesitant potential investors. Though that was the case, the industry's anonymously monikered super PACs refrained from mentioning crypto in the ads they bought to boost or block candidates. The long game wasn't about winning crypto support in the field, but getting people into Washington who would eventually be on the industry's side.  ""This was an industry — Fairshake, as part of those efforts on the PAC side — that was really running a very smart and strategic and impactful political operation,"" said PAC spokesman Josh Vlasto, in an interview with CoinDesk. ""That not only paid off on Nov. 5 in terms of what the new Congress is going to look like with, I think, 300 or so pro-crypto members. But now you have an operation that's really proven its effectiveness going into the next cycle.""  While election night had already made clear last month that the industry had walked away with a substantial number of new congressional friends, it took weeks for all of the races to be ironed out. The final tight battle was in the California 45th Congressional District, where the crypto-favored Republican Michelle Steel lost to Democrat Derek Tran with only several hundred votes separating the two in a district that drew more than 300,000 votes.  Another of its November losses, Representative Lori Chavez-DeRemer, a Republican from Oregon, won Trump's nod to be the next head of the Department of Labor.  But the two biggest contests occurred at the beginning and end of the election cycle. Fairshake went in guns-blazing in California, spending about $10 million in its Senate primary to smother the campaign of Representative Katie Porter, a Democrat who was allied with the industry's most hated lawmaker: Senator Elizabeth Warren. The opposition effectively drowned out her campaign.  And more recently, Fairshake declared war in Ohio, pitting more than $40 million against the re-election hopes of Sherrod Brown, the Democratic senator who has been chairman of the Senate Banking Committee as it held the line against crypto legislation. That money — by far the largest block of spending in the state — went to support Bernie Moreno, a blockchain entrepreneur, who took the seat by more than 200,000 votes and helped flip the Senate to a Republican majority.  Those were Fairshake's most dramatic plays, but its longterm success could come from the dozens of lesser-known races it targeted in the primaries. In many cases, the PAC located a crypto fan from either party in a district in which that candidate's party was dominant (meaning the primary would really decide the election). Fairshake or its affiliates would often drop more than $1 million into these races to dominate the spending there and smooth the candidate's path into the general.  In one Arizona district, the PAC put $1.4 million into backing a former vice mayor of Phoenix, Yassamin Ansari, who won her primary by just 42 votes. The crypto campaign-finance effort spent a little more than $70 for each of the votes she won in that primary, but Ansari went on to take the general election with almost 71% support.   Fairshake only funded four losers in the primaries, and the vast majority of its primary winners headed into this month's general election with low-stress confidence, because they had the right party affiliations to easily win their districts. In some places, though, the PAC spent money pushing crypto-fan incumbents in longer-odds contests, and five of them ended in defeats.  Its success rate neatly illustrated that its tactics were a rapid answer to what had been a deeply tarnished reputation in Washington. Against the odds, the crypto industry emerged from a 2022 disaster in which some of its biggest names foundered and millions of investors lost money.  The effort from Fairshake may have borrowed some lessons from the industry's previous attempts to woo lawmakers, but it was far more focused. In the previous cycle, when FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried was at the height of his pre-collapse powers, he and his FTX executives gave money to one in three members of Congress (though in much smaller, direct contributions). This time, the focus was on flexing its unlimited-spend ability in highly targeted matchups where it calculated that the money could make the difference.  Fairshake's patron companies realized that the overall track record for crypto in the previous election cycles ""had been a failure,"" Vlasto said. It hadn't been sufficiently ""organized, professional, thoughtful, balanced and focused,"" he argued.  He's the one authorized to speak for the super PAC, because it otherwise shields its strategists from media, and the companies behind it won't comment on how the organization was given its marching orders or what its ongoing relationship is with donors. At least two of the organizers of GMI returned two years later to help run Fairshake, though the PAC doesn't disclose its inner workings. Vlasto also splits his duties as spokesman with an even more secretive crypto-pushing organization, the industry's dark-money Cedar Innovation Foundation, which has gone after the sector's chief political enemies but won't identify its backers.

Hayes urged investors to learn from EOS and avoid investing in overvalued projects. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has warned individual investors to avoid overvalued projects and make investment decisions with caution in a new article. In his new article, Arthur Hayes outlined the altcoin projects that investors should stay away from: “Retail crypto investors need to say no to: – VC-backed high FDV, low volatility projects – Primary listings of overvalued tokens on CEXs -Projects with low liquidity” Hayes emphasized that investors should be more careful and do good research when investing in the future, and gave the example of EOS Network, which he thinks had the most value-destroying and unsuccessful ICO. Hayes emphasized the importance of learning from failures like the EOS ICO. At this point, Hayes criticized EOS for being the most destructive ICO project of 2017, stating that EOS raised $4.1 billion in the ICO but then disappeared. “There were indeed a lot of obvious ‘junk projects’ in the 2017 ICOs. One of the most disruptive ICOs was EOS. Block.one raised $4.1 billion in crypto to build EOS, but EOS almost disappeared after it launched.” *This is not investment advice.

Phishing scams in November cost crypto users $9.38 million, according to ScamSniffer’s latest calculations, with more than 9,200 victims affected. https://twitter.com/realScamSniffer/status/1863820465388876164 In an X thread on Tuesday, Dec. 3, the blockchain analytics firm said the largest loss involved a single individual who saw $661,000 in stETH, a utility token representing a share of the total Ethereum ( ETH ) staked through the protocol, vanish within minutes. You might also like: Chainalysis: ETH scams linked to Japanese crypto exchanges drop 69% in H1 2024 The report highlights several notable incidents: a $409,000 loss in WBTC on the Arbitrum network, a $344,000 loss in FET on Ethereum’s Uniswap platform, and a $220,000 loss in USDT on Ethereum via direct transfer. The analysts attribute much of the damage to malicious signature requests, saying this type of attack remains “the deadliest weapon.” While the total stolen amount was down by 53% from October’s $20.2 million and September’s $45.8 million, the victim count remains troublingly high, the analysts warn. The firm noted that the phishing threat continues to evolve, with the exit of the infamous Inferno Drainer scam being followed by the rise of the Angel Drainer attack method. Blockchain security firm CertiK estimates that losses from phishing attacks in Q3 soared to $343.1 million across 65 incidents. The analysts labeled phishing as the most damaging attack vector for the quarter. At the time, Scam Sniffer pointed out that fake accounts X were the leading cause of how victims ended up on phishing websites, while dubious Google ads were the second most common hook.

Set for the Q1 2025 launch, the new infrastructure will use Chainlink’s tech stack for various functions. Moreover, it will adhere to Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority supervision. According to the announcement : 21X and Chainlink will enable on-chain secondary market price feeds for bid and ask prices on the first EU-regulated distributed ledger technology (DLT) trading and settlement system, which will be launched under the supervision of BAFin, Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority. Chainlink’s technology will help in several functions. These include ensuring access to stablecoins and assets in different blockchains, facilitating cross-chain interoperability via the CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol), and providing accurate and secure price data for products listed on 21X. European markets have seen increased activity as the region welcomes the comprehensive Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework. For instance, Tether halted its stablecoin operations in the EU last week , citing challenges under MiCA. Chainlink Labs’ Global Head of Banking & Capital Markets commented on the alliance with 21X, stating: We’re excited to partner with 21X and help foster the adoption of regulated blockchain-based markets across Europe. Reliability and security are paramount when transacting within controlled environments, and Chainlink’s infrastructure provides valuable support for enhancing the user experience of 21X’s tokenized securities market infrastructure. LINK price action The altcoin trades at $24.95 after retracing from the latest high, though still 26% up on its daily chart. Source – Coinmarketcap LINK’s 24-hour trading volume has jumped to $9.38 billion after an 800% increase within the past day. Thus, Chainlink exhibits massive bullish momentum, signaling continued upswings. According to the daily chart, LINK formed a symmetrical triangle setup in 2021. The altcoin has consolidated within this pattern since then, only to overcome it some days ago. The breakout indicates chances of a bullish flag formation, which might propel LINK prices to $50 in the upcoming months. That would lead to an over 100% gain from current values. However, sudden bearishness would trigger significant dips. Chainlink could dip to $18.66 and push lower to $14.9. Nonetheless, surging interest from institutional players positions LINK for robust price actions in the upcoming sessions.

With a price spike of 24% since the previous day, the Flare market price has surpassed the $0.035 milestone. On the verge of hitting the $2 billion market cap, FLR is preparing to extend its parabolic surge. Following the nearly 186% surge in the past 30 days, FLR prices are preparing for a massive surge in December 2024. So, let’s look closer at the upcoming rally in FLR prices. Flare Price Analysis In the daily chart, the Flare price action shows a parabolic rally, gaining momentum. With a streak of positive histograms, the FLR price has surpassed the $0.035 critical psychological resistance. Tradingview Furthermore, the five-day streak of consecutive bullish candles has accounted for a price surge of nearly 60%. The Flare price recovery rally has surpassed 61.80% from the March level at $0.03688. Starting from $0.012, the recovery run has now achieved 200% returns over the last four weeks. The FLR price recovery rally breaking above the 50% Fibonacci level marks a change in trend momentum and the underlying sentiments. This has increased the chances of Flare’s price reaching its 52-week high at $0.056. Flare Technicals and Price Targets Currently, Flare is trading at a discount of 33% from its 52-week highest price, reflecting room for growth. The recovery run has influenced a golden crossover between the 50 and 200-day EMA lines. Furthermore, the rising 100-day EMA closing its gap with the 200-day EMA line teases a possible crossover. Supporting the bullish trend, the MACD and signal lines have maintained a positive alignment with a streak of rising histograms. Hence, the technical indicators for the Flare price trend are extremely bullish. Based on the Fibonacci levels, the recovery rally is inching a bullish closer above the 61.80% Fibonacci level. This will target the next immediate resistance at $0.043. Beyond this, the uptrend in the FLR price trend could end in 2024 at a price level of $0.063, or the 1.272 Fibonacci level. On the flip side, the failure to sustain prices above $0.036 will likely retest the 50% Fibonacci level at $0.03217. Read More: Flare Price Prediction 2024-2030: Will FLR Price Hit $0.10? FAQs 1. What is the current resistance level for Flare? The immediate resistance level for FLR is $0.043, with a long-term target of $0.063 at the 1.272 Fibonacci level. 2.

37166392,https://coinpedia.org/?p=388385,1733214784,Fed Rate Cut in December: Could It Drive Bitcoin Toward $100K?,"The post Fed Rate Cut in December: Could It Drive Bitcoin Toward $100K? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is now betting heavily that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 0.25% in December. According to the CME FedWatch tool , the chances of this happening have risen to 74.5%, up from 66% just a few days ago. This means more and more investors believe the central bank will take action at its meeting on December 17-18. If the Fed cuts rates, it would be the third reduction this year. What Does a Rate Cut Mean to Crypto? A rate cut would lower the cost of borrowing money for individuals and businesses. When interest rates are lower, it becomes cheaper to take out loans, which can encourage people to spend and invest more. For the stock market and high-risk investments like Bitcoin, rate cuts are often seen as a positive development. Investors may feel more comfortable taking risks and investing in assets that could offer higher returns—like cryptocurrencies. Right now, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate is between 4.5% and 4.75%, following two earlier cuts this year. A further reduction would signal a more supportive economic environment, likely encouraging more investors to put their money into riskier assets such as Bitcoin. However, Marko Papic, Chief Strategist at BCA Research, predicts the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in December. He also believes the US dollar could peak by mid-2025, driven by potential economic growth disappointments under Donald Trump. What Are the Fed Officials Saying? Federal Reserve officials are signaling that a rate cut could be coming soon. Governor Christopher Waller mentioned on December 2 that he’s leaning toward supporting a cut, but it will depend on upcoming economic data, like inflation and job reports. Likewise, New York Fed President John Williams has said that interest rates might be lowered gradually, but he hasn’t specified when that might happen. Essentially, the decision will hinge on how the economy performs in the next few weeks. Bitcoin’s Positive Reaction Bitcoin has seen a significant price increase this year, more than doubling in value. Many analysts are optimistic that Bitcoin could break the $100,000 mark by the end of 2024. With a potential rate cut from the Fed, Bitcoin’s price could continue its upward momentum, benefiting from the increased appetite for riskier investments.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/fed-rate-cut-in-december-could-it-drive-bitcoin-toward-100k/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37167132,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51212,1733214640,Algorand And XRP Surge As FXGuys ($FXG) Presale Is Heating Up – Don’t Miss Out On This Profit Opportunities,"The cryptocurrency market is currently red-hot, and investors are rushing to maximize their profits from the many lucrative opportunities that are available. Among the notable tokens dominating the bull run are Algorand (ALGO) and Ripple (XRP). However, despite the ALGO and XRP surges, a new crypto, FXGuys ($FXG) , is rising in the market despite being in its presale. Remarkably, investors are turning to FX Guys due to its growth prospects, which are expected to surpass those of Algorand and XRP in this bull cycle. Thus, $FXG has grown to become the best cryptocurrency investment option as its presale heats up. Read on for more details! >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE Algorand Surges to New Highs as Golden Cross Appears on the Chart Algorand performed well in November 2024 as the crypto rally dominated mainstream investment headlines. On November 30, ALGO peaked at $0.47. Analysts have mentioned that ALGO’s recent spike was boosted by the emergence of a “golden cross” technical pattern. As ALGO formed this pattern, analysts speculated that it was a sign of potential sustained growth and it sparked increased buying activity. Remarkably, Algorand’s trading volume has increased, reaching $1.01 billion—a 284% increase, according to market data. Interestingly, ALGO is on its longest bullish streak since 2021, gaining momentum from November 5. After a momentary drop to $0.25 on November 26, the token rebounded massively, hitting levels last seen in November 2022. If this Algorand rally continues, analysts say ALGO could surpass $0.65 in the coming weeks. ALGO was trading at $0.44 on November 30, up 46.16% in the past week. Analysts expect ALGO to rise to $0.56 in December as more buying pressure hits the market. As ALGO surges, investors have discovered $FXG, a token expected to become the best cryptocurrency investment option in this bull market due to its massive growth potential. Ripple’s XRP Thrives with Regulatory Milestones and Bullish Momentum XRP bulls have been dominant since November 2024. Earlier in the month, the Ripple coin’s price hit three-year highs but long-term investors started taking profits. The move by these investors caused a temporary pullback. Nonetheless, the crypto bulls have returned and the crypto is aiming for the $2.05 resistance. Ripple is almost securing regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) for its RLUSD stablecoin. RLUSD is pegged 1:1 to the dollar, wholly backed by US dollar deposits and secure assets, and will launch on December 4, 2024. This milestone is a great way for Ripple to join New York’s heavily regulated crypto sector. Previously hosted on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum, RLUSD is set for growth into DeFi ecosystems, with collaborations including MoonPay and Bitstamp. As Ripple enhances its dominance in the stablecoin space, XRP’s market cap has surpassed $100 billion, highlighting growing resilience despite the ongoing SEC lawsuit. XRP traded at $1.91 on November 30, up 22.38% in the past Week. Experts believe XRP will hit $2.35 in December as more developments happen within Ripple’s network. Despite this impressive growth, investors are turning to a new crypto, $FXG, due to its massive profit opportunities. FXGuys: The New Crypto Dominating the Bull Market The crypto market has been heating up in November and investors have reaping big amidst the massive bullish trends. Amongst the biggest winners is a new crypto, FXGuys , which is still in its presale but making waves in the market. Its underlying token, $FXG, has many utilities that appeal to users in the current bull cycle. In that context, FXGuys has become dominant due to its multi-faceted approach that helps generate huge profits. The FXGuys Trade2Earn model offers investors $FXG tokens for their trading activities, creating a network that allows users to earn continuously when they execute trades. This feature boosts the experiences of active traders who seek multiple strategies for generating income besides relying on profits acquired from market movements. The current volatility has pushed investors to look for long-term stability, and the FX Guys staking feature has proven to be an ideal solution. Staking on this platform enables users to earn passive income. Investors can stake and earn 20% of the platform’s profits, distributed according to the amount of staked tokens. This investment model connects the platform’s success directly to the token owners, ensuring profits increase as FX Guys grows. Hence, $FXG has become the best cryptocurrency investment option with minimal risks. Another remarkable feature that makes $FXG unique is its Trader Funding Program, which lets skilled and talented traders access accounts with large balances. The program offers them the required capital to implement their investment strategies at scale. On that note, traders share some profits with $FXG token holders, maintaining a continuous revenue stream for the investors. Notably, the Trader Funding Program increases the value of the FX Guys network, making it the best cryptocurrency to invest in this bull run. Hence, it will exceed the profits investors are making in the Algorand and XRP rallies. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE $FXG is the Best Cryptocurrency Investment Option with Massive Growth Potential As Algorand (ALGO) and Ripple (XRP) record significant growth, the rise of a new crypto, FXGuys ($FXG) , is quickly attracting investors who want highly profitable opportunities. With its unique mix of DeFi innovations and features, $FXG offers a massive chance for users to enjoy profits surpassing those recorded by ALGO and XRP. Investors are buying $FXG aggressively since they consider it the best cryptocurrency investment option in the market because of its long-term growth prospects and strong ability to generate passive income for all investors. Currently available in Stage 2 of its public presale, $FXG is valued at $0.04, with current buyers set for a 25% profit when the token moves to Stage 3 of the presale at $0.05. Moreover, $FXG will gain 150% in price once it lists on mainstream markets at $0.10. As $FXG’s presale heats up, investors believe it is the best investment option in this bull cycle.

Don’t Sleep on Qubetics’ Unstoppable Presale,"VeChain (VET) has been making waves in the blockchain world for years, cementing itself as a key player in supply chain management and enterprise adoption. Known for its ability to track and authenticate products with blockchain technology, VeChain has given its early investors life-changing returns. Starting its ICO journey in 2017 with a price of just $0.0008, VeChain has climbed to its current trading price of around $0.018, showcasing the immense potential of getting in early on the right projects. But if you missed the VeChain train, don’t sweat it. A new opportunity is here to fill the gap— Qubetics ($TICS) . Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, Qubetics offers a unique solution to one of blockchain’s biggest challenges: interoperability. By introducing a Web3 aggregated chain that unites networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, Qubetics could be the breakthrough the blockchain industry has been waiting for. With its ongoing presale gaining traction, analysts are calling it the best altcoin to buy now for both newcomers and seasoned investors alike. How Qubetics Is Leading the Way in Blockchain Interoperability The blockchain world isn’t as connected as you’d think. Most networks operate in isolation, creating barriers to seamless data exchange and cross-chain transactions. This lack of interoperability has limited the potential of decentralised applications, making it harder for businesses and developers to collaborate across ecosystems. Qubetics, the world’s first Web3 aggregator . By creating a unified framework that bridges Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and more, Qubetics is solving the blockchain fragmentation problem. Its Web3 aggregated chain allows users to easily transfer assets, share data, and execute cross-chain transactions. Take businesses, for instance. Imagine a global retailer that wants to integrate supply chain data from a VeChain-based system with financial applications on Ethereum. With Qubetics, this process becomes seamless, eliminating inefficiencies and boosting productivity. Developers also benefit, as they can build decentralised apps that interact across multiple networks without the usual technical headaches. The benefits are just as exciting for everyday users. Say you’re a Bitcoin holder looking to invest in Solana’s DeFi ecosystem. Qubetics allows you to bridge your assets quickly and securely, unlocking new opportunities previously out of reach. This innovation is why $TICS is considered the best altcoin to buy now. The Qubetics Presale Is Taking Off Right now, the Qubetics presale is the talk of the crypto community. In its 11th stage, the presale has already raised over $4.1 million by selling more than 259 million tokens to 5,700+ holders. At just $0.0282 per token, it’s an accessible entry point for those looking to get in on the ground floor of a project with serious potential. But here’s the deal—the 10th stage is wrapping up soon, and the price is set to increase by 10% in the 12th stage, which kicks off this weekend. If you’ve been waiting for the right time to invest, this is it. The growth projections for $TICS are nothing short of jaw-dropping. Analysts predict it will hit $0.25 by the end of the presale, delivering a 783% ROI. Post-presale, the token is expected to climb to $1, representing a 3,434% return. For those with the patience to hold, a $5 valuation translates to a staggering 17,570% gain, while $15 after the mainnet launch would mean a 52,912% ROI. Let’s break that down—an investment of $7,500 today could balloon to $3.975 million if these projections come true. What sets Qubetics apart from other ICOs is its real-world utility. It’s not just another speculative token—it’s a platform solving a critical issue in blockchain technology. This makes $TICS a good investment and one of the best altcoins to buy now for anyone looking to capitalise on the next big thing. Why VeChain’s Success Story Offers Lessons for Qubetics Investors VeChain (VET) has become a case study in how early investments in the right crypto projects can pay off big. Launched in 2017 with an ICO price of just $0.0008, VeChain aimed to revolutionise supply chain management by using blockchain to ensure transparency and authenticity. Today, it trades at roughly $0.042 a significant leap that has rewarded its early adopters handsomely. VeChain’s enterprise-focused approach attracted big names like Walmart China and BMW, helping it secure a strong position in the market. Its ability to integrate blockchain technology into real-world use cases has been a major factor in its success. However, VeChain’s rise also highlights the importance of timing. Those who got in during its early days reaped the most rewards, while latecomers face diminished opportunities. This is why Qubetics is catching the attention of savvy investors. Much like VeChain, Qubetics offers a practical solution to a real-world problem. Its focus on blockchain interoperability makes it a unique player in a crowded market, and its ongoing presale provides a chance to get in early before the token reaches its full potential. If you’re kicking yourself for missing out on VeChain’s early days, $TICS could be your second chance. Final Words: Why Qubetics Is the Best Altcoin to Buy Now In a market flooded with hype and speculation, Qubetics stands out for its focus on utility and innovation. Solving the blockchain interoperability problem is creating a platform that benefits businesses, developers, and users. The presale offers a rare opportunity to get in early on a project with immense upside potential. With $TICS priced at just $0.0282 and analysts predicting life-changing returns, there’s no better time to invest. Whether you’re looking to diversify your portfolio or make your first crypto move, Qubetics is the best altcoin to buy now for both seasoned and new investors.

Tenreiro, formerly the acting chief of the SEC’s crypto and cyber unit, will now oversee enforcement lawsuits and investigations nationwide. His new position marks an important shift in the agency’s leadership at a critical time for the crypto industry. New SEC Leadership for the Crypto Unit This transition follows the departure of former SEC litigation chief Olivia Choe, who left the agency in July for a private sector role at Milbank LLP. Tenreiro’s tenure in the SEC’s crypto assets unit has been marked by high-profile cases, including lawsuits against major players like Kraken, Coinbase, Tron, and Ripple Labs. His team also led enforcement actions against FTX and Terraform Labs, with the latter resulting in a record $4.47 billion settlement earlier this year. Simultaneously, the SEC’s crypto and cyber unit has undergone its own leadership changes. Mark Sylvester and Laura D’Allaird have been named co-chiefs of the unit, succeeding Tenreiro in overseeing its crypto-related enforcement actions. Both have extensive experience within the SEC, with D’Allaird previously serving as counsel to outgoing Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga and Sylvester as the assistant director of the crypto unit. These appointments reflect a continued focus on cryptocurrency regulation, even as the incoming administration signals a potential easing of regulatory scrutiny. President-elect Trump’s pro-crypto stance and plans to reform the SEC’s approach could reshape the agency’s enforcement priorities. However, Tenreiro’s leadership suggests the agency may continue its aggressive stance on crypto-related violations until any policy changes are formally enacted. Controversy and Criticism Follow Tenreiro The recent leadership change has not been without controversy. Crypto lawyer John Deaton recently criticized him, calling him one of the least desirable lawyers for the crypto industry to hire if he ever leaves the SEC. The criticism highlights tensions between the agency and the crypto community, which has often accused the SEC of overreach and inconsistent regulation. As the Trump administration prepares to take office, the SEC’s reshuffled leadership faces a critical moment in shaping the future of cryptocurrency regulation. Whether Tenreiro’s tenure as chief litigation counsel marks continuity or change remains to be seen, but his history suggests a firm commitment to robust enforcement.

In a recent X post , Armstrong warned that the Coinbase team will immediately cut ties with law firms that hire people who have committed “bad deeds” against the crypto industry while under the Biden Administration . He believed that law firms are still unaware of the crypto industry’s stance on the previous administration His declaration followed a recent case where Milbank, a law firm based in New York that Coinbase worked with, hired ex- SEC chief Gurbir Grewal as a partner in its New York office. Gurbir was head of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement for three years before stepping down on Oct. 11. Armstrong stated that Coinbase has terminated its partnership with Milbank and refuses to work with the law firm for as long as Gurbir is still a partner at their office. “It’s an ethics violation in my book to try and unlawfully kill an industry while refusing to publish clear rules. If you were senior there, you cannot say you were just following orders,” Armstrong wrote in his post. We've let all the law firms we work with know, that if they hire anyone who committed these bad deeds in the (soon to be) prior administration, we will no longer be a client of theirs.

He believed that officials who were responsible for trying to destroy the crypto industry should be held accountable for their actions. “We as an industry should not be putting money in their pocket after the abuse. Let your law firms know that hiring these folks means losing you as a client,” he said, adding that these figures should find work in other fields, as he does not believe in “permanently cancelling people.” Throughout his tenure at the SEC, Grewal has led the government agency to more than $20 billion in civil penalties and over 2,400 lawsuits. On the day of Grewal’s departure, the SEC announced that he authorized more than 100 enforcement actions against crypto firms, digital asset operators, and virtual currency purveyors for allegedly breaking federal securities laws. Coinbase amidst the SEC’s ‘war on crypto’ The SEC under Biden’s Administration has been accused of being fiercely anti-crypto, going so far as waging a “war on crypto.” Up until October 2024, there have been eight lawsuits with settlements valued at $19.45 billion aimed at crypto firms under the Biden Administration. Compared to last year, the value has increased by 78.9% compared to the previous year. In March 2023, the SEC sent a notice to Coinbase, informing the exchange that it planned to take enforcement action, alleging the exchange of violating several securities laws. The exchange fired back at the regulator by filing a lawsuit to compel the commission to respond to a request for new rules for the cryptocurrencies. However, the SEC asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit, citing a lack of obligation. In June 2023, the regulator filed a lawsuit against Coinbase and its related entities, but did not name Armstrong or other executives.

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports.

Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MRDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/mr-chill-doge-solana-memecoin-to-rally-14000-before-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-and-bonk-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37165715,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=311432,1733213041,"Crypto, Stocks and ‘Everything Bubble’ Still Has Room To Run, According to Analyst Jason Pizzino","A closely followed analyst believes the economy is in the midst of an “everything bubble” that still has more potential to grow. Analyst Jason Pizzino tells his 121,100 followers on the social media platform X that peak cycle highs may still be a ways off for assets like stocks and crypto. “When we take a broad look at the market there are still a lot of investors that are thinking the stock market, real estate and crypto gains so far are ‘too good to be true’ and this time they’re going to get out before the crash. This is NOT how macro, end of cycle tops are formed. The 18-year cycle ‘Everything Bubble’ peak still has more time to develop and bring major FOMO (fear of missing out) unlike what we have seen.” The analyst predicts that Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other assets are gearing up for additional rallies in the bullish market cycle. “Bitcoin, real estate, stock markets and altcoins are setting up for the biggest pump in history. I think it has already started, but there are still plenty of investors asking, ‘When will it start?’ Look around, the markets have been up for years and don’t look like they will stop any time soon. Especially not now that we have a perfect ‘This time is different’ scenario brewing within US politics.” He also says that Bitcoin may now be on the verge of entering an explosive phase of the market cycle based on historic precedence. “The Bitcoin four-year cycle has officially entered the right side of the cycle, which means this is a strong market. Three out of the current four cycles have fooled the majority of people into thinking the cycle would end early, aka a left-translated cycle like in 2011, 2019, and most recently 2024. Each time, Bitcoin has gone on to make a new all-time high in the second half of the four-year cycle, the ‘right’ side. This now means we enter what I’m calling ‘The Final Boss,’ or ‘Grand Final.'” Source: Jason Pizzino/X Bitcoin is trading for $95,799 at time of writing, down 1.9% in the last 24 hours.

In a recent post on X, Kusama revealed that he discovered a plan by what he termed “shadowcats” to compromise the DAO’s governance structure. Took me a moment to realize it, and it only came in a dream, but now I see the shadowcats plan to take over the dao. Same plan from before, (mostly) new bad actors. It won't succeed as plans are in place for just such actions. — Shytoshi Kusama (@ShytoshiKusama) December 2, 2024 Kusama’s revelation came unexpectedly. He describes it as insight gained through a dream. He stated that these attempts would not succeed, emphasizing that the team has prepared countermeasures to protect the ecosystem’s integrity. The Shiba Inu DAO and the Community’s Response The proposed DAO is designed to give every token holder a voice in the project’s decision-making process. This approach aims to democratize governance, allowing community members to participate regardless of their stake size. Community members quickly rallied around Kusama’s stance. One supporter noted the importance of proactive security, stating that identifying potential threats early is crucial for maintaining the ecosystem’s long-term stability. However, another community member stressed the fundamental principle of decentralized governance, arguing that once a proposal receives sufficient votes, it should proceed without external interference. If the SHIB team can approve or reject proposals voted on by the community, it could lead down a slippery slope of centralized control and a pattern of rejecting the desires of those with stakes in the ecosystem. The community’s response highlighted a collective commitment to protecting the DAO’s core principles. Many appreciated the leadership’s transparency and willingness to address potential challenges head-on. They view the DAO as a critical mechanism for ensuring fair and democratic decision-making within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Other Major Developments in the SHIB Ecosystem There are many other exciting developments in the community. In collaboration with K9 Finance, the Shiba Inu team has introduced a reward program encouraging new users to engage with Shibarium’s liquid staking feature. First-time users can earn up to $500 as a holiday incentive. This aims to boost the adoption of the Ethereum-based sidechain and its staking functionalities. Liquid staking allows participants to earn rewards by staking Bone tokens while gaining kBONE, a liquid representation for broader use within the ecosystem. This initiative seeks to enhance activity and reinforce Shibarium’s growth. Experts believe a SHIB bull run is on the horizon, and with the many positive developments in the ecosystem, it might surpass expectations.

Effectively avoid dependence on powerful ASIC miners and GPUs, and avoid mining machines and GPUs consuming a lot of energy when running. Eliminate CPU mining: When Bitcoin was first launched, mining was a relatively simple process that could be completed using the central processing unit (CPU) of an ordinary computer. Early miners could use personal computers to get Bitcoin rewards. At that time, the network was small and the difficulty of mining cryptographic equations was low, so ordinary users could mine. However, as more and more miners joined the network, competition intensified and the difficulty of mining increased. This resulted in miners needing to install more powerful hardware to benefit from the mining process. Adoption of GPU Mining: As the difficulty of Bitcoin mining increased, miners switched from hardware using CPUs to devices using GPUs. Compared to CPUs, GPUs are better suited for the parallel processing required by the PoW algorithm, making mining more efficient. This shift marked a turning point in the development of Bitcoin mining technology, allowing miners to optimize operations and profitability. GPUs allow miners to mine more Bitcoin in a shorter period of time and contribute to network security by increasing the computing power dedicated to the blockchain. With the shift to GPUs, mining pools also became popular, where miners combine their computing resources to increase their chances of earning Bitcoin.

Hayes argues that the crypto space has diverted from its core mission of empowering retail investors. ICOs provide a more democratic and inclusive way of funding projects unaffected by the biases of traditional VC firms. In his essay “ The Cure ,” Arthur Hayes, founder of BitMEX, criticizes Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) and venture capital-backed projects for hindering innovation in the crypto industry. He advocates for a return to Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) as a solution to the problems caused by CEXs and traditional venture capital. Hayes contends that the crypto industry has deviated from its core mission of empowering retail investors, instead focusing on venture capital-backed tokens that have underperformed. He also notes the evolution of the crypto new issue market, which has become similar to traditional finance (TradFi), especially with the introduction of “memecoins.” Hayes views memecoins as tokens with no inherent value beyond their ability to spread memes and potentially generate wealth for early adopters.

Analysts Warn of Sharp Correction appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP has once again drawn attention from the crypto community, not just for its recent price surge but also for concerns about its centralized token supply. According to Crypto analyst IncomeSharks, over 43% of XRP tokens remain locked and are not in circulation, raising fears of a sharp drop back to $0.60 soon. 43% XRP Held By Ripple In a recent tweet post, IncomeSharks pointed out that nearly half of XRP’s total supply remains locked away. Ripple, the company behind XRP, controls 38.9 billion tokens in its escrow accounts . This level of centralization has raised worries among investors about the potential for manipulation. https://twitter.com/IncomeSharks/status/1863717475168424230 “Imagine if you were on Pump Fun and saw the developer owned 43% of supply,” the analyst remarked, drawing parallels to tokens with high centralization, which often trigger concerns about manipulation. XRP Price To Plunge To $0.60 To support his critique, IncomeSharks shared a chart showcasing XRP’s historical price trends. The chart reveals a familiar pattern, sharp price spikes followed by steep corrections. In April 2021, XRP soared to nearly $2 but lost 75% of its value within two months. Similarly, after hitting $3.40 in 2018, the token plunged by 92% shortly after, suggesting its price is heavily influenced by speculative trading. Recently, XRP surged to $2.74 , marking an impressive 410% rise in just one month. Meanwhile, the chart hints at another possible correction to $0.60 a drop of almost 4x from its current price level, following past patterns. Pump-and-Dump Allegations IncomeSharks pointed out that XRP is often criticized for its frequent price jumps followed by steep drops, known as pump-and-dump cycles. A big reason for this concern is that Ripple still holds a large amount of XRP tokens, which gives them significant control over its supply. There’s a reason why many in the crypto space don’t trust this token,” IncomeSharks added, reflecting the general skepticism in the community",NEGATIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-crash-to-0-60-analysts-warn-of-sharp-correction/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

The Bitcoin price soared close to $100K and the older altcoins, which remained silent for quite a while, became active. This was followed by a huge rise in market sentiments and a massive influx of volume. Now that both appear to have halted for a while, the question arises whether the bulls are about to experience extreme fatigue in the coming days. If so, what’s next for the ongoing bull run? Apart from many things in common, the current bull run is showing some dissimilarities too. The traders have become more vigilant now as they are extracting profits after a brief rally followed by some relaxation phase. The BTC price is the best example, which is stuck within a range after experiencing a 65% to 70% drop in the trading volume. Currently, popular altcoins like XRP & ADA are attracting huge volume, which has kept the price elevated, but this Santiment data shows the trend could fade soon. The above chart shows the ratio between the positive and negative sentiments of BTC, ETH, XRP, ADA, & XLM. Soon after Donald Trump’s victory, the ratio of Bitcoin spiked heavily, close to 60%, while the average range was around 20%. Besides, the sentiments of altcoins also surged to some extent but quickly faded out. This suggests the euphoria from a week ago is showing trader fatigue. Despite the massive growth in XRP, XLM, or ADA prices, the traders have gone quieter a bit after taking profits in late November. The markets now appear to have been moving in the opposite direction of the expectations. Therefore, as per Santiment, the silence towards the top caps should be considered an encouraging sign that FOMO won’t be interfering with any further upswing in the coming days. Hence, the markets may witness a calculated approach for the upcoming bullish action, excluding the euphoric sentiments.",NEGATIVE,ADA | BTC | XRP,ADA | ALTCOIN | BTC | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bullish-sentiments-for-xrp-ada-may-fade-soon-heres-why-fomo-may-not-work-this-bull-run/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

The ban is placed across 102 domains, among which most are related to online gambling tied to crypto exchanges by the Telecommunications Regulator of Cambodia on Nov. 20. These exchanges are reported to be operating without the proper licenses and authorizations required by Cambodian law. While the websites are placed under the ban, mobile applications are still functional. This ban might be put in place to cater to the growing population of digital asset users in the country, which is expected to rake around $8 million in 2024, according to Statista . The Digital Assets market in Cambodia will reach $8,031,000 in revenue in the next year, although growth is anticipated to taper off through 2025.

Regulatory background and context Binance, one of the blacklisted exchanges in Cambodia, has held a long relationship with the country since signing a memorandum of understanding with the SERC aimed at creating digital currency regulations in 2022. Additionally, the company partnered with the Royal Group, a significant business conglomerate in Cambodia, to add force to blockchain adoption and also trained the country’s Interior Ministry officials in Jun. 2023 on detecting crypto-related crimes. Despite these efforts, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in terms of trading volume has been debarred. “ We are closely monitoring the evolving situation, ” said Binance spokesperson Lily Lee in relation to the ban.

The current and future outlook for digital assets in Cambodia As previously reported by crypto.news, crypto-related scams have been on the rise in Cambodia. According to UNODC , these groups are more active on the dark web, using cryptocurrencies as a form of payment to launder money and take part in illicit activities. Furthermore, Huione Guarantee , a crypto-led platform used by cybercriminals in Southeast Asia, is also linked to Cambodian conglomerate Huione Group, as per Chainalysis .

The rise started in early November after the Republican victory in the U.S. election reignited investor confidence in tokens linked to U.S. companies, including XRP's associated Ripple Labs.  Large holders are playing a key role in contributing to the move. CryptoQuant data shows whale activity – which tracks movements from large wallets to and from exchanges – has been consistently elevated since the past month, multiples higher than any other period.  Whales can move markets with their buying or selling pressure, and tracking this can indicate their market sentiment.  For instance, if the cryptocurrency's inflow into exchanges (Exchange Inflows) is significant, it might suggest that whales are preparing to sell, potentially signaling a bearish market trend. Conversely, large outflows from exchanges might indicate accumulation by whales, which could be bullish.  However, such whale movements tend to coincide with local peaks, CryptoQuant's contributing analyst Woominkyu said in a post Monday, as sophisticated participants sell on retail inflows.  “Historically, significant spikes in whale-to-exchange transactions (marked by red circles) align closely with XRP price peaks,” Woominkyu stated. “This suggests that whales tend to move large amounts of XRP to exchanges to sell near local or cycle tops.”  “The latest spike in whale-to-exchange activity coincides with XRP reaching a local price of around $2.3. This could indicate whales preparing for potential profit-taking or increased market activity,” Woominkyu added.  XRP is up 14% in the past 24 hours, outperforming bitcoin and all other crypto majors, according to CoinDesk data.

In the past month specifically, XRP has appreciated in value by more than 400% making it third largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization. With such an unprecedented heightening, Ripple is, however, keen to warn that it has registered a steep rise in cases of fraudulent scams. Ripple’s Stance Against Fraud As a courtesy of social media platform X, Ripple assures its customers that neither they nor founder nor CEO Brad Garlinghouse will ever ask users to send XRP. The message from the firm said , “Ripple will never ask you to send XRP, and neither will Brad, David, Monica, Stu, or anyone else from Ripple.” Stay vigilant!” Ripple has also described its strategy for addressing scams, which involves partnering with law enforcement agencies like the FBI, monitoring fraud-related activities with other experts, and guiding users to report any scam. XRP’s Latest Success Lead To Scammers Targeting Investors The recent upsurge of XRP due to hope in Ripple’s cases against the American SEC and rising institutional adoption also make the token a favourite of fraudsters. The partnerships in cross-border payment solutions and overtures to an XRP-supported exchange-traded fund or ETF have added to the lift of Ripple across the market. However, this surge has also attracted poor-minded people who are aiming to make profits using the increased investment juice such as deep fake, phishing emails and fake giveaway schemes.

US Government Moves 10,000 BTC To Coinbase","As the Bitcoin price consolidates just below its all-time high of $99,540, a significant move by the US government has raised concerns among investors. The government has transferred a substantial amount of its seized Bitcoin holdings to Coinbase, potentially signaling intentions to sell. This echoes similar actions that had previously impacted the market earlier this year. US Government’s Bitcoin Transfer According to market intelligence firm Arkham, the US government moved approximately 10,000 Bitcoin, worth around $1.92 billion at current market prices, to two separate wallets. Related Reading: Dogecoin Boom Over? Crypto Analyst Warns Of Sudden Sell Signal One wallet contains Bitcoin valued at $969 million, while the other holds approximately $949 million. This strategic allocation has drawn attention, especially given the government’s history of selling seized Bitcoin, which can create notable selling pressure in the market. Data from crypto analytics firm Dune indicates that the US government currently holds a staggering 183,422 BTC, valued at over $17.6 billion. This accounts for roughly 0.93% of the total Bitcoin supply. Should the government decide to sell a portion of these holdings, it could exert significant downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, reminiscent of previous sell-offs that followed major transfers. A Halt To Government Sales In 2025? Historically, such actions have led to increased volatility. For instance, NewsBTC reported in April, when the Bitcoin price peaked at $73,700, that the government transferred over 30,000 Bitcoin seized from the Silk Road marketplace. This followed a previous seizure of more than 50,000 BTC from James Zhong, who allegedly obtained these funds through illegal means related to the Silk Road in 2012. Following these transfers, Bitcoin experienced substantial price fluctuations and a downward trend over the subsequent months. In 2022, the government also sold 9,800 BTC, with plans to divest an additional 41,500 Bitcoin. This history raises concerns that the latest transfer could lead to a similar outcome, potentially jeopardizing Bitcoin’s recent upward price momentum. However, there are emerging hopes that such moves could be curtailed in 2025. Related Reading: Fantom Price Breakout: Analyst Shares Anatomy Of FTM’s 18,000% Move To $150 By 2025 President-elect Donald Trump is expected to assume office on January 20, and he has proposed a strategy that includes making Bitcoin a strategic reserve asset for the US. This approach would involve the government purchasing nearly 1 million BTC rather than selling its current holdings, with plans to use these assets to help reduce the nation’s $36 trillion national debt. This proposal has been introduced in Congress by US Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis under “the Bitcoin Act,” which has garnered bipartisan support. With the recent shift in leadership from Democrats to Republicans securing a majority in the House, there is optimism that this bill could come into effect in the second or third quarter of 2025. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $96,000, down 0.7% over the past 24 hours.

Why? Well, for starters, this isn’t just any routine appointment. Trump promised to kick out Gary Gensler , the current SEC Chair, on his first day back in office—and Gensler has already announced he’s stepping down. So, who’s going to take the reins? And what could this mean for crypto’s future? Gensler’s Era: Love It or Hate It Let’s talk about Gary Gensler for a sec. During his time at the SEC, he really went all-in on crypto regulation. Some people loved that he cracked down on fraud and made things like Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs a reality. Others? Not so much. His “regulation-by-enforcement” style rubbed a lot of people the wrong way, especially those who think the U.S. should be leading in crypto innovation—not scaring companies away. With Gensler out of the picture, Trump has a big chance to shift gears. Pro-crypto voices are already buzzing about what comes next. Will the SEC finally focus on clarity and innovation? Or are we just trading one set of problems for another? Who’s Likely to Land the Job? Okay, here’s where it gets interesting. Prediction markets like Kalshi are pointing to Paul Atkins as the frontrunner. This guy is all about innovation and seems to be the polar opposite of Gensler. He’s pushing for clear, pro-business crypto rules, and honestly, that’s music to a lot of ears in the industry. But he’s not the only name being thrown around. There’s Dan Gallagher, Mark Uyeda, Robert Stebbins, and Heath Tarbert, too. Solid contenders, sure, but none have the same buzz as Atkins. Trump’s transition team is apparently in the final stages of picking someone, so we’ll know soon enough. What to Expect If Atkins—or someone like him—gets the job, we could see a huge shift in how the U.S. handles crypto. Instead of enforcement crackdowns, we might get clearer rules that help companies innovate without fear. That could attract more businesses and investors to the space, which is a win-win, right? But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Politics is messy, and big promises don’t always pan out. Still, for now, all eyes are on Trump’s announcement. Could this be the moment that changes everything for crypto?

An 89.5% growth in just one week? Unbelievable! But what if I say that something even more exciting is happening in the XRPL-based meme coin market? Excited to know more? Then, read on! XRP’s Rise and Meme Coin Gains Like I mentioned before, XRP has witnessed significant growth lately. In the last 30 days, with a surge of 441.5%, it has outperformed all the other top ten cryptocurrencies, triggering excitement among XRP enthusiasts. At the time when the crypto world is discussing excitedly about the enviable performance of XRP, a totally unexpected trend has emerged in the XRPL-based meme coin market. The trend has truly left most meme coin enthusiasts speechless with excitement. Some XRPL-based meme coins, including ARMY, BEAR and MAG, have shown impressive growth lately. ARMY’s Spectacular Growth Considering that the meme coin market has dropped by at least 4.2% in the last 24 hours, the general trend in the market appears ‘less bright’. However, the same is not the case when it comes to the XRPL-based meme coin market, implying that at this moment, this market is more tempted to follow the XRP trend than the general meme coin trend. In the last 24 hours, ARMY, one of the most prominent XRPL-based meme coins, has seen a rise of 50.2% – far higher than Dogecoin’s -2.4%, Shiba Inu -0.1%, Pepe’s +0.2%, Bonk’s +0.2%, and dogwifhat’s 2.35. Indicating a notable growth in market activity in the ARMY market, ARMY has experienced an excellent surge in trading volume of at least 48%. XRPL Meme Coins Gaining Momentum ARMY is not the only exceptional player in the XRPL-based meme coin market. If it were, the trend could have been ignored as a one-time wonder. The story of BEAR is not different. With a massive 30-day rise of 395.6%, it has expressed its solidarity with ARMY. Notably, in the last 14 days alone, the BEAR market has witnessed an increase of 224.4%. There is no wonder about reports citing an increase in users moving from Solana and Etheruem to XRP Ledger. Volume Comparison and Market Concerns Can this be interpreted as XRPL taking over the meme coin market? Well, that sounds like an exaggeration. Data indicates there is still a long way to go for the XRPL market if they really want to become a market leader. The volume analysis is enough to reveal this reality. The daily trading volumes of the top meme coins like Dogecoin ($11,929,910,703), Shiba Inu ($3,149,361,501), Pepe ($4,666,566,941) and Bonk ($754,672,721), are far higher than ARMY’s $74,388.56 and BEAR’s $2,085,276. XRP’s Market Achievement At this stage, it is important not to ignore the achievements the XRP market has recently made. The most important of which is its rise to the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, surpassing Tether. It seems that speculations regarding the launch of XRP ETFs and reports regarding improving regulatory clarity are offering the necessary optimism that the market needs to grow higher and higher.",POSITIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrpl-meme-coins-like-army-and-bear-are-exploding-as-xrp-price-soars-441/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

While big buyers like MicroStrategy are still active, other cryptocurrencies are seeing more attention. The U.S. government’s recent transfer of nearly 20,000 Bitcoin to Coinbase has raised eyebrows, with many experts calling it a bad move, especially as Bitcoin’s global importance grows. Why Are Experts Criticizing This? Jason Lowery, a US Space Force engineer, labeled the move a “huge strategic mistake,” arguing that Bitcoin’s value goes beyond price. He compared the sale to an act of ignorance, warning that the government might regret it later. Lowery even suggested a scenario where the government might reverse course, recalling historical decisions like Executive Order 6102, which forced Americans to sell their gold to the government in the 1930s. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong joined the critics, stating that selling Bitcoin makes little sense. Crypto educator Toby Cunningham called it short-sighted, adding, “If they sell, the market will absorb it instantly.” Was It Really a Sale? As of now, it’s not clear if it was an actual sale or not. According to Spot On Chain, a crypto analytics platform, the transfer could be related to managing or consolidating Bitcoin wallets rather than liquidating assets. Julio Moreno from CryptoQuant added that only 10,000 BTC might have been sold, while the rest—around 9,800 BTC—was sent to a new wallet. In contrast to earlier sales, which caused sharp price drops, this move only led to a minor dip in Bitcoin’s price to about $95,800. Despite the transfer, the U.S. government still holds a significant amount of Bitcoin, approximately 183,850 BTC, worth $17.7 billion, largely seized from operations like the takedown of Silk Road Crypto Impact When the transfer was detected, Bitcoin prices briefly dipped by almost 3% to $94,500. However, the market quickly recovered, with Bitcoin trading around $96,000 at the time of writing. Analysts are closely monitoring whether Bitcoin can push past the important $100,000 mark or if the rally will be limited by profit-taking and investors spreading their capital into other assets. Is Crash on Horizon? With this sudden sell-off plan, there is also a rumor that President Joe Biden might sell off a large amount of the U.S. government’s Bitcoin holdings before leaving office to make it harder for President-elect Donald Trump to create a U.S. Bitcoin Reserve, as he promised during his campaign. The U.S. holds a lot of Bitcoin because of its efforts to seize assets from illegal activities. If Biden sells this Bitcoin, it could limit Trump’s ability to use it for his reserve without needing extra funds. Some people believe Biden has used similar tactics in other areas, like foreign aid, to block Trump’s plans. Will this move break the current bull run?

On the other hand, altcoins mostly attracted inflows, including Ripple’s XRP. According to the latest CoinShares report , Ethereum saw inflows totaling $634 million, reflecting a dramatic shift in sentiment that has driven its year-to-date inflows to $2.2 billion, surpassing its 2021 record of $2 billion. XRP experienced inflows of $95 million, the largest on record, likely due to the hype surrounding the possible launch of a US ETF. Closely following XRP were Cardano and Chainlink, with $0.9 million and $0.8 million in inflows, respectively. Litecoin, however, saw a modest $0.2 million in inflows during this period. Meanwhile, multi-asset products and Solana experienced outflows of $16.3 million and $3.8 million, respectively. Zooming out, digital asset investment products attracted a total of $270 million in inflows last week, revealing an unusual contrast in asset flows within the class. Although US ETFs began offering options, despite high initial volumes, ETP volumes have not seen a similar increase, with last week’s total at $22 billion compared to $34 billion the previous one. Inflows this year have reached a record-breaking $37.3 billion.

The ENA token is a governance token for the Ethena ecosystem.  “Integrating Ethena’s immense liquidity and strong user base with Derive.xyz’s unparalleled derivatives protocol not only unlocks significant opportunities for Derive.xyz users, but also positions it as the premier on-chain derivatives platform,"" Nick Forster, Founder of Derive.xyz, said.   ""Together, we are setting new standards in DeFi, offering innovative solutions that cater to both retail and institutional traders. Get ready for the next generation of groundbreaking on-chain derivatives, liquidity, and financial products,"" Forster added.  Derive said it's integrating USDe as collateral, allowing users to trade while simultaneously earning a passive yield. Ethena's USDe is a synthetic dollar, which uses a hedged cash-and-carry strategy, also known as the basis trade, and collateralized stablecoin to maintain the $1 price peg.  The on-chain derivatives protocol is also debuting vaults for staked USDe (sUSDe) holders, enabling them to load up on reward by combining Ethena's staking yields with Derive' structured product strategies.  Ethena has over $4 billion in TVL as of writing, with over 300,000 users and integrations with the largest centralized exchanges like Deribit and ByBit.   Meanwhile, with a TVL of $79 million, Derive is the world's largest decentralised protocol, facilitating programmable on-chain options, perpetuals, and structured products.

The move was confirmed by a spokesperson for the Telecommunication Regulator of Cambodia (TRC), which oversees the country’s telecommunications sector, according to a report from Nikkei Asia . The action follows a directive signed by acting TRC chairman Srun Kimsann, which restricted access to 102 domains, primarily targeting online gambling sites.

In 2022, Binance signed a memorandum of understanding with SERC to assist in developing digital currency regulations and collaborated with the Royal Group, a prominent Cambodian conglomerate. Binance also trained Interior Ministry officials in detecting crypto-related crimes earlier this year. “We are closely monitoring the evolving situation,” said Binance spokesperson Lily Lee, adding that multiple platforms were affected by the restrictions.

Crypto Spot Trading Volume Surges to $2.71 Trillion in November November saw a resurgence in cryptocurrency trading, with monthly spot trading volumes soaring to $2.71 trillion—the highest level since May 2021. The figure represents a more than twofold increase from October’s $1.14 trillion, with Binance dominating the market, processing $986 billion and accounting for 36% of the total volume. Other major exchanges, including Crypto.com, Upbit, and Bybit, also reported impressive performances, each exceeding $200 billion in monthly trading volume. The rally extended to futures markets as well, with Bitcoin futures reaching $2.59 trillion in total trading volume and Ethereum futures hitting $1.28 trillion—both marking their highest levels in over two years. The surge was largely driven by the reelection of pro-crypto Republican Donald Trump as U.S. President on November 6. Furthermore, November was a historic month for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, with investors pouring $6.4 billion into spot BTC ETFs. The surge in inflows coincided with a month-long rally that saw Bitcoin’s price soar by 45%, reaching an all-time high of $99,000.

The upcoming US president promised to launch a strategic national Bitcoin stockpile, which will add to the existing BTC holdings. The creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the United States will kickstart a global movement, which will heighten the overall demand. Furthermore, more countries around the world have a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 100 percent, led by Japan and the United States, which is not sustainable in the long haul. US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve According to Denis Porter, the CEO and co-founder of Satoshi Action Fund, there is a high chance that strategic Bitcoin reserve legislation will pass at the state level before the upcoming Trump administration gets to implement a similar policy. However, Porter noted that Trump could issue an executive order in the first week he gets into office, which could give the federal government a head start. I can now officially confirm and announce that 10 states will be introducing ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserves’ legislation here in the great United STATES of America. We are going to win with Bitcoin. We will lead the world. No one will come close. The word will follow our lead. — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) December 3, 2024 Already, Porter confirmed that 10 different states in America have already laid out plans to introduce a strategic Bitcoin reserve. To facilitate the legislation process, Porter has requested the crypto community to donate to the Satoshi Action Fund. Meanwhile, Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff has cautioned crypto investors to keep their hopes low on the strategic BTC reserve. Furthermore, Schiff believes that the bill has no huge support other than Senator Cynthia Lummis and Ro Khanna.

The ones that have experienced a huge rise during the 2021 bull run have again started to swell, hinting towards the return of pro-traders. After a magnificent run, the Bitcoin price has begun to remain stagnant a bit. This has enabled the other altcoins to swell, which have attracted massive gains. XRP & ADA prices, for instance, have surged beyond $1 after remaining stuck below $0.4 to $0.5 for quite a long time. Similarly, here are a few more tokens that may achieve the $1 milestone in a short while from now. Polygon (MATIC) The monthly chart of MATIC price suggests the price is about to experience a fine bullish push, which could initiate a 40% rally The conversion & baseline of Ichimoku Cloud are about to validate a bullish crossover, which could further flip the cloud to be bullish Besides, the monthly RSI is incremental and could reach the neckline of the parabolic curve at the upper threshold. Therefore, the Polygon price is expected to break the resistance at $0.75 anytime from now and secure $1 before the end of 2024 The Sandbox (SAND) The SAND price has broken from the multi-year descending pattern, the falling wedge and is accumulating strength for the next bullish wave The buying volume has dropped after a massive rise but the sellers are just restricting below the resistance zone between $0.79 and $0.88 while failing to drag the price lower Besides, the rally continues to remain within the accumulation phase, as suggested as the indicator just triggered a bullish divergence Secondly, the +Di displayed a bearish divergence but no specific movement was seen with the -Di while ADX remained elevated. This suggests the price is preparing for the next upswing beyond $1. Decentraland (MANA) The MANA price is testing one of the crucial resistances within the range of $0.74 and $0.81, which also collides with the 200-day MA. This range also collides with the neckline of the Adam and Eve chart pattern, which includes a v-shaped recovery followed by a parabolic curve. Besides, the RSI is about to re-enter the overbought zone, which may end up in a small pullback Therefore, the MANA price could rise beyond $1.1 and face a pullback to the zone, followed by a healthy rise towards the higher targets Algorand (ALGO) Algorand price has reached levels not seen since November 2022 and hence the token is expected to remain elevated as buying volume has increased heavily Besides, the RSI has entered the overbought zone and shows no signs of deviation, but after some point, the levels have to face rejection Therefore, the price is expected to reach $0.82, which may attract some bearish activity but the current support zone between $0.39 and $0.45 or a little higher, could offer a base to trigger a strong rebound With this, the price may remain elevated and mark $1; meanwhile, if the resistance at $0.66 holds the rally, the bearish narrative may fade off Other than these tokens, the two altcoins that are very close to reclaiming $1 are Mantle (MNT) & Ethena (ENA).

Struggling to pick up pace, the ETH price trend consolidates between 20 and 50 EMA lines in the 4-hour chart. Based on the current price action, a breakout of either EMA line will determine the upcoming trend. Let’s find out more in this Ethereum price prediction. Ethereum Price Analysis On the 4-hour chart, ETH price action reveals a rising channel pattern. The support trendline is in confluence with the 100 EMA line of the 4-hour chart. Despite the quick bullish movements in the rising channel, the ETH price failed to breach the critical resistance at $3,750. This has led to the ongoing bearish reversal characterized by a dome-shaped pattern. Tradingview The Ethereum Price had retraced to $3556 last night to test the 100 EMA line and the local support trendline. The price is currently preparing its bullish turnaround in the 4-hour chart. Further, the recovery run is now challenging the 20 EMA line. Technical Indicators: MACD: The MACD and signal lines are in a bearish alignment. However, the declining bearish histograms reflect the average line closing the gap and teasing a bullish crossover. Ethereum Spot ETFs Net $24.23M on December 2 Ethereum spot ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $24.23 million on December 2, marking six consecutive days of positive inflows. BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF (ETHA) led the pack with a single-day net inflow of $55.92 million, followed by Fidelity’s ETF (FETH) with $19.9 million. The total net asset value of Ethereum spot ETFs now stands at an impressive $11.13 billion, reflecting growing investor confidence and interest in Ethereum. Will Ethereum Price Hit $4,000? In the next 24 hours, the Ethereum Price trend faces a decisive moment near the $3,550 support level. A bounce from this level could ignite a sharp V-shaped recovery, targeting the $3,759 resistance and reigniting bullish momentum. The U.S. trading session will play a pivotal role, with increased trading volumes and positive sentiment needed to fuel an uptrend. Conversely, failure to hold support could lower the Ethereum Price, potentially retesting $3,382 if sideways action persists. However, a market-wide recovery could see the Ethereum Price break above $3,750. This will set the stage for a rally toward $4,064. Will the bull run in ETH surpass $4,000 in 2024?

The European Central Bank may drop offline digital euro payments if it can’t agree with smartphone makers on secure chip integration. In a digital euro progress report published on Dec. 2, the central bank has emphasized that secure elements — specialized hardware chips embedded in mobile devices — are essential to ensure offline transactions can be conducted safely and reliably. The ECB detailed ongoing discussions with device makers and technical service providers to overcome the complexities of deploying offline digital euro solutions. However, without consensus on implementation, the project might eventually face potential delays or a complete scale-back. “Due to its highly controlled environment, deploying an application remotely is complex and involves multiple stakeholders.” The European Central Bank You might also like: Russia’s central banker behind CBDC steps down While the ECB is exploring digital euro features, without agreement from tech partners its offline use could potentially be limited. Thus far, it remains unclear whether the offline feature will advance or stay as a conceptual idea given that the challenge isn’t unique to the eurozone. For instance, Sweden’s Riksbank, in its latest research report , also highlighted the technical and regulatory hurdles for enabling secure offline payments with the e-krona, the country’s proposed central bank digital currency. The Riksbank warned of liquidity risks stemming from unsynchronized balances between offline and online wallets, creating potential usability and security issues for recipients of offline transactions. To mitigate such risks, Riksbank suggested solutions like restricted offline usage or centralized liquidity pools but acknowledged these require further evaluation.

If concerns are confirmed, the fund may choose to divest from these entities. Reuters reported Monday that the Council on Ethics for the fund will review its portfolio companies. If a company falls short in ethical compliance, the council may recommend divestment or add it to a public watch list. Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global, the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, manages assets worth $1.8 trillion. It was established to manage surplus income from the oil and gas industry, aiming to ensure financial stability for future generations through diverse global investments. Norway’s Ethics Council to Investigate Crypto, Gambling Firms Over Money Laundering Risks Reuters reported reviewing a document from the ethics council sent to the finance ministry on Oct. 10. The document states that in 2025, the Council on Ethics will investigate crypto and gambling companies, among others, due to their high money laundering risks. The fund had reportedly increased its cryptocurrency investments , purchasing a 0.83% stake in Coinbase worth $453m. It also acquired shares in Marathon Strategy, Block and Marathon Digital. The ethics watchdog will also probe other companies, including shoemakers. It will also review firms accused of human rights violations in the occupied West Bank. Ethical Standards Lead Norway’s Fund to Exclude Hundreds of Firms According to Reuters, Norway’s fund has excluded 189 companies on ethical grounds. These include Airbus and Boeing for nuclear weapons production, and Glencore and RWE for coal-related activities. The fund’s investment choices are also guided by other ethical criteria, including human rights abuses, major environmental damage, severe corruption and the production of tobacco and cannabis. Its primary aim is to spread risk across various asset classes to ensure stable long-term returns. Cryptocurrencies, while risky, offer a diversification benefit due to their low correlation with traditional financial assets. Still, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin remain under scrutiny for their energy-intensive mining, which may clash with the fund’s ethical investment standards. Last month, a Norwegian government committee recommended delaying the launch of a central bank digital currency ( CBDC ). It stated that there is no immediate need to improve financial inclusion or emergency readiness, but emphasized the importance of preparing regulations for potential future issuance.

The technical indicators record a mixed price sentiment, indicating reduced price action. Positively, BTC ETFs record three consecutive days of inflow. Despite increased bullish price sentiment in the altcoin market, the BTC price continues struggling around its $96,000 level. With this, the dominance of the largest crypto token by market cap has reduced to 54.38%, the lowest in 4 months. In this article, we have covered the latest Bitcoin price analysis and mentioned the possible short-term price prospects. BTC Price Displays A Consolidated Price Action The Bitcoin price has experienced a consolidated price action for about a week now, highlighting a decline in the buying-and-selling pressure. Moreover, with a trading value of $96,139.92, it has a market capitalization of $1.902 billion. TradingView: BTC/USDT The Simple Moving Average (SMA) acts as a support to the BTC price chart in the daily time frame, indicating a strong bullish influence for the star crypto in the market. Further, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) continues hovering close to the overbought range. However, with its average trendline showing a descending trend, the BTC price hints at a mixed price action today. Bitcoin ETF Update Over the past 24 hours, only 2 out of 11 BTC ETFs recorded a negative outflow. Reportedly, BlackRock’s “IBIT” has encountered the highest inflow of $338.3M, followed by Fidelity’s “FBTC” with $25.1M. Source: SoSoValue On the other hand, Bitwise, Valkyrie, and WTree recorded a neutral flow. Moreover, with a total outflow of $39 million, the net flow of Bitcoin ETF for 02nd December concluded at +353.6 million. Will BTC Price Hit $100k Tomorrow? If the bulls regain momentum, the Bitcoin price will retest its resistance level of $97,000. Maintaining the price above that level could push the price of this crypto token toward its $98,000 level. However, a bearish reversal could pull the price toward its support level of $95,000. Moreover, if a sell-off is witnessed, this could result in it retesting its lower psychological level of $92,000.

The 21X exchange, which runs on the scalable Polygon chain, plans to launch its exchange for tokenized financial instruments from its Frankfurt headquarters in the first quarter of 2025, the company said on Tuesday.    The plan is to trade tokenized equity, debt securities, funds, as well as more exotic real-world assets (RWAs) such as real estate or artworks that qualify as eligible financial instruments.    Tokenization has become popular among traditional finance firms, with the likes of asset manager BlackRock now driving the trend. From a regulatory perspective, Europe is on the verge of welcoming a new regime for crypto assets, the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, the next phase of which is set to start at the end of this year.    The 21X license has been issued under the EU’s DLT Pilot Regime (DLTR), and is the result of an 18-month process that involved BaFin, the German Federal Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank), the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Central Bank (ECB), 21X said in a press release.    “This is more than just a license – it’s a revolutionary moment for capital markets,” said Max Heinzle, CEO of 21X in a statement. “For the first time ever institutional and retail investors can trade and settle tokenized securities on a fully regulated, blockchain-based exchange with the same level of trust, security and compliance as traditional markets.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | SPONSORED,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/12/03/tokenized-securities-exchange-21-x-wins-approval-from-germany-s-ba-fin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cc1a515f9729d86f52eb2d5500cb6151eea9c51e-1500x946.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Licensed by Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM), D2X comes out the gate with 7-days-a-week trading in cash-settled BTC-EUR and ETH-EUR Calendar Futures, followed by USD-denominated Calendar Futures & Options scheduled for early 2025.  Futures and options account for a huge amount of trading in traditional markets, but crypto derivatives are disproportionately small.

Despite being progressive, the report highlighted some challenges facing the process. These challenges include holding limits for Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), privacy, and law harmonization. The progress report highlights the first half of the preparatory phase, following the investigative and design phase. The digital Euro scheme’s Rule Development Group (RDG) has been instrumental in driving the review process and taking actions based on the review. Some actions include launching the seven new RDG work streams with market participants and central banks in May 2024. The RDG is shaping the rulebook for the digital Euro The rule book focused on critical areas, including minimum user experience standards, risk management, and implementation specifications. The RDG is working on the next phase of the rulebook, which should be finalized during the digital euro preparation phase. Comments from the RDG interim review should be included. The rulebook is critical for authenticating Digital Euros. It lays the basis for Digital Euros to be accepted throughout Europe , just like cash payments. Their report is anticipated in July 2025. More research is needed on user profiles to establish the likely needs of users. The researchers are eager to establish the preferred holding limits for users. An area they will decide after results from technical research conducted with National Banks. The report stressed: “Comprehensive user research and technical experimentation activities are being conducted to gather actionable insights into user preferences and to develop innovative use cases for the digital euro.” ~ ECB’s digital Euro progress report The project team tackles holding limits and provider selection for the digital Euro Earlier, there were reports that holding limits created a standoff between the national and European central banks. One practical solution under review for maintaining an upper holding limit is a “reverse waterfall.” The plan is to see any excess digital Euros automatically transferred to fiat in a linked bank account. The report also added that a team is working on a solution for offline transactions without giving details. The report foresees fierce competition between European and non-European service providers and emphasizes the quest for more technical services, including wallets . The project team has developed steps for the sourcing procedures for picking potential providers for the Digital Euro Service Platform. A call for tender on external components is running, and assessments are ongoing. The Eurosystem national central banks are invited to make offers on internal components.

Trump Loves Russia (TRUMPRUS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRUS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Russia can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Russia could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Russia launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Russia on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Russia by entering its contract address – Qq41T28zPi8Wg7KWjeYMKkQPnUZ68ULvgWTEFpkaJXJ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRUS.

The studio also revealed plans for an updated website to showcase its groundbreaking work and preserve its legacy. However, details on how the website will function, whether it will include tools for collectors, or how existing RTFKT NFT holders will be supported remain unclear. Additionally, there has been no mention of how this move aligns with Nike’s broader metaverse strategy or the future utility of RTFKT’s popular Ethereum-based collections , such as CloneX and MNLTH, which have generated combined royalty earnings of over $30 million, according to data from DeFiLlama.

According to data provided by Dune, 35.5% of the blocks in BSC were manipulated by Sandwich attacks, abusing the blockchain’s transparency, immutability and decentralization. This set a new record high for the BSC network. Source: Dune In Sandwich attacks, the malicious actor would put one order before and another right after a large transaction — sandwiching the on-chain transaction — to potentially purchase an asset at a lower price and sell before the victim makes a move. The main intention of Sandwich attacks is to manipulate the price of a crypto asset on decentralized exchanges .

Moreover, 645 active bots executing these manipulative attacks have been spotted on the BSC network within the same timeframe. Last week, the total DEX volume on BSC reached $9.2 million. The rise of the Sandwich attacks in the BSC ecosystem comes as the network’s native token, BNB ( BNB ), recorded a 17% surge over the past month. BNB is changing hands at $656 with a market cap of $94.5 billion at the time of writing. On the other hand, Sandwich attacks on Ethereum ( ETH ) have been declining since July — falling from 62.9% to 40.2% over the last five months.

More modest contributions came from Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust, which recorded $6.36 million in inflows, and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC, which saw $5.56 million flow into the fund.

37164367,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51235,1733207601,"ChatGPT Sets XRP Price For December 31, 2024","XRP is currently one of the most exciting cryptocurrencies in the market. After a prolonged period of underperformance, the digital asset finally shows it can compete with the major players in the crypto space. Meanwhile, XRP has surpassed major competitors like Solana and Binance Coin to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. At the time of press, XRP is trading at $2.73, surged 24% over the past 24 hours, sparking excitement among investors and analysts. The digital asset reached its highest point since 2018, and many experts believe it could surpass its all-time high soon. Amid this spectacular performance, we consulted ChatGPT for its analysis and prediction to see where XRP’s price will be by December 31, 2024. ChatGPT Projects Massive Increase for XRP According to ChatGPT, XRP’s price could rise to $4 by the end of December, representing a 46.52% increase from its current value. This milestone would see XRP surpass the all-time high of $3.84 set in January 2018. Multiple factors in the current market landscape can contribute to this bullish outlook, and other experts have recently shared bullish outlooks that support the positive sentiment surrounding the asset. Key Drivers Behind the Projected Surge The cryptocurrency market is experiencing an overwhelmingly bullish trend due to increased optimism following Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election. Trump has consistently supported the crypto market, and experts expect pro-crypto policies that could help the market grow. This expectation has caused institutional investors to flock into the market . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s recent breach of the $1.96 level was also a pivotal event. Experts have long believed that if it surpassed its 2021 peak it would go on a substantial run, and the digital asset has decisively broken above this level. This successful breakout has paved the way for further price acceleration, with $4 being a very achievable target. The resignation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, slated for January 20, 2025, is another catalyst driving XRP’s bullish narrative. Gensler’s departure will usher in a more favorable regulatory environment for XRP and cryptocurrencies. This anticipated policy shift has boosted investor confidence, reinforcing upward price momentum. XRP’s increasing adoption in global financial systems, particularly for cross-border payments, continues to fuel its long-term growth potential. The asset’s performance has been particularly noteworthy as it outpaces much of the market in percentage gains. ChatGPT’s $4 price prediction aligns with the sentiment of many market participants who believe XRP’s unique use case legal clarity positions it as a leader in the next wave of crypto adoption.

37164366,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51230,1733207441,Altcoin Anomaly 360% Surge as Ethereum (ETH) Whales Target Rising ERC20 Tokens!,"Though Bitcoin recently dipped slightly, historically marking the beginning of alt-coin season, alts like Ethereum aren’t expected to go parabolic until after Christmas in January. It’s important to note that we are still early, though experts are pleading with investors to act fast before the next rally. For Q1 2025, Rollblock has been singled out as a viable prospect to lead the highly lucrative gaming rally projected for 2025. Read on to learn more. Ethereum Faces Skepticism Despite Its Upward Momentum During An Irrefutable Bullish Period Alongside most alt-coins, Ethereum is staunchly in the green as the fear and greed index swings in between greed and extreme greed In Q4. Despite Ethereum’s multi-year dominance as the leading layer-1 blockchain, Ethereum is facing increasing skepticism over its long-term sustainability. Critics highlight Ethereum’s vulnerabilities and weaknesses compared to newer competitors like Solana and Sui, which boast faster transaction speeds and lower fees in comparison. Still, most analysts predict that Ethereum will achieve new all-time highs this cycle, driven by interest from retailers, a robust bull market that should be larger than the 2021 parabolic run, and most notably, Ethereum spot ETFs. Current projections suggest Ethereum could peak between $6000 and $8,000, though some forecasts remain conservative, placing its realistic ceiling closer to $5,000. Ethereum’s Short-Term Trajectory Explored As Ethereum evolves, its price performance has drawn attention from the cryptocurrency community, recently returning to the $3,600 price point for the first time since July 2024. This rally is fueled by increased institutional adoption and the rising USDT supply on the blockchain, which grew by 27% in November alone. Ethereum also recently reclaimed its dominance over Tron in stablecoin activity, underscoring its relevance in the broader crypto ecosystem beyond decentralized applications. In addition, Ethereum’s “Beacon Chain” recently celebrated its fourth anniversary, marking an important milestone in the blockchain’s transition to the proof-of-stake consensus it is renowned for. Researchers highlight this upgrade’s achievements as superior to proof of work in terms of scalability and security, yet simultaneously acknowledge the existing room for improvements including faster finality and enhanced censorship resistance. Rollblock: Could This ERC-20 Token Lead The Incoming Gaming Rally In 2025? As the bull market accelerates, Rollblock is emerging as a potential candidate to lead the iGaming sector in 2025. Optimistic projections from analysts suggest a 72.5% rise for Rollblock this quarter, with potential gains exceeding 25x by Q1 2025. Constantly updating in response to community feedback, Rollblock is set to introduce sports betting services alongside its extensive library of over 7,000 games in the coming months. Continuous updates, driven by strategic partnerships with leading blockchain entertainment providers, ensure the platform remains at the cutting edge of innovation. With a rapidly growing community of over 20,000+ members, Rollblock provides multiple earning opportunities beyond simply HODL’ing. Users can stake RBLK tokens for passive income or earn play-to-earn rewards through active participation. A built-in token-burning mechanism further supports RBLK’s value by limiting supply, discouraging sell-offs, and fostering long-term engagement. Currently priced at $0.037 in its 8th presale stage, RBLK presents an exceptional opportunity for early investors. Experts anticipate up to 10x returns by early 2025, with gains potentially reaching 25x-100x if Rollblock lives up to its potential and leads the incoming gaming rally in 2025.

Despite its remarkable rally, SOL has recently lost the spotlight to Altcoins like XRP, risking a major correction in the coming days. Related Reading: Cardano Could Be Heading For A 20% Correction – Technical Data Signals Bearish Price Structure Solana To Retest $200? Solana has outperformed most of the market during this cycle, leaping over 231% in the last year. The ecosystem has been the talk of the town, with Solana-based memecoins leading the market’s narrative and SOL’s DeFi activity outpacing Ethereum’s. Less than a month ago, the cryptocurrency’s bullish rally saw the altcoin surpass Binance Coin (BNB) as the fourth-largest token by market capitalization. SOL saw its price rise near the $200 zone, propelling its market capitalization to $88 billion on November 6. Since then, its market cap has surged nearly 20% to $105 billion, but SOL’s momentum has begun to slow down as other cryptocurrencies pick up steam. On Sunday, XRP flipped Solana and Tether (USDT) to become the third-largest crypto by market cap, sending SOL to the fifth position. XRP’s milestone made some investors and market watchers worry about SOL’s future performance since the cryptocurrency has experienced a 14% retrace from its latest ATH of $263 nine, recorded nine days ago. Crypto analyst Income Sharks noted that Solana displays a bearish structure on its lower timeframe chart. According to the post, the altcoin has been forming a Head and Shoulders (H&S) pattern in the past month after a three-week diagonal trendline break, suggesting a trend reversal for Solana. On Sunday night, SOL dropped below the $230 mark, hitting its lowest price since November 15 and breaking below the pattern’s neckline. This could potentially send Solana to retrace around 10% and test its previous support zone between the $200-$210 range. Similarly, crypto analyst CRG noted that a retest of these levels would be possible before bouncing to new highs. SOL Sees Historic November Close Despite the recent retrace, several crypto watchers consider SOL’s rally is far from over, highlighting the token’s strength throughout the cycle and its achievements. Crypto Jelle pointed out that Solana still targets the $400-$600 in its price discovery mode after it broke out of an 8-month bullish pennant in November and “locked in a monthly breakout too.” Likewise, Rekt Capital noted that the cryptocurrency recorded a historic close this November, as it saw its “Highest candle-bodied Monthly Close of all-time.” Other analysts also concurred, hinting that investors should remain optimistic about the $400 target as momentum remains strong.

This comes as Trump prepares to follow through on a campaign promise: firing Gary Gensler on day one of his presidency. Gensler, who has already announced his resignation effective January 20, leaves behind a stormy legacy shaped by his relentless crackdown on crypto and his aggressive regulatory agenda. 🚨NEW: @realDonaldTrump ’s pick to replace @GaryGensler as @SECGov Chair could be announced as soon as tomorrow, sources tell @FoxBusiness . Stay tuned 📺. — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) December 3, 2024 Former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins is among the potential candidates Trump’s shortlist of candidates includes former Commissioner Paul Atkins, Robinhood’s Chief Legal Officer Dan Gallagher, Willkie Law Firm Partner Robert Stebbins, and current Securities and Exchange Commission Commissioner Mark Uyeda. Whoever gets the nod will likely change how the commission approaches cryptocurrencies, financial markets, and corporate oversight. Gensler’s leadership at the SEC was defined by lawsuits, regulatory scrutiny, and industry-wide frustration. The agency took on major players like Coinbase and Binance, accusing them of operating unregistered securities exchanges. The fallout wasn’t just limited to crypto either. Wall Street executives and industry leaders clashed with Gensler over his push for transparency and tighter rules. His leadership style (viewed as micromanaging and rigid) earned him enemies within his own agency too. High attrition rates among SEC staff were frequently attributed to his methods. Critics, including some members of Congress, called him “heavy-handed” and “out of touch.” Yikes! Trump has wasted no time distancing himself from Gensler’s playbook. The president has repeatedly shared his desire to create a pro-crypto environment. “We’re firing the bureaucrats who stifle innovation,” he said at a rally a few months ago.

37163024,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51222,1733205481,XRP Prepares for Parabolic Surge. Expert Sets Timeline For 3 Digits,"XRP has been at the center of attention recently due to significant market movements and optimistic projections from analysts. The asset recently achieved a notable milestone by surpassing its 2021 peak of $1.96, a development that has sparked excitement among investors. XRP’s current price of $2.71 represents a 37.01% surge in the past 24 hours, with its peak reaching $2.8487. This surge has also pushed it above Solana, BNB, and USDT, making it the third-largest cryptocurrency. JackTheRippler, a prominent crypto analyst, has shared a detailed chart showcasing XRP’s potential for a parabolic surge. He predicts that the asset could achieve triple-digit values, signaling unprecedented growth for XRP. According to the chart, XRP has historically experienced significant upward trends following prolonged consolidation periods, and the current setup appears to mirror past patterns. #XRP prepares for a parabolic surge. We could see 3 digits next year! pic.twitter.com/7DCM7MtPxq — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) December 1, 2024 The Impending XRP Bull Run Renowned trader Peter Brandt recently noted the importance of XRP breaking through the $1.96 level , suggesting it was a key resistance point. Now that this milestone has been surpassed, the possibility of a major rally becomes increasingly likely. This sentiment aligns with JackTheRippler’s analysis, which suggests that XRP is on the verge of a significant upward trajectory. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Speculation about the broader regulatory and political environment in 2025 is also boosting optimism. Over the years, XRP’s legal challenges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have shaped its trajectory. However, this could soon change as SEC Chair Gary Gensler leaves office on January 20. Experts believe the coming crypto-friendly SEC Chair will end Gensler’s long-running war against crypto. Gensler’s departure would create a more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. Additionally, speculation about policy changes under Donald Trump’s administration in 2025 fuels positive sentiment among investors. How High Can XRP Climb JackTheRippler is confident that XRP will triple digits in 2025. According to his chart, he expects the digital asset to reach $271.16, an astonishing 9,906% increase from its current price. JackTheRippler has previously shared extremely bullish expectations for XRP. In October, the analyst predicted that the digital asset would climb to $40 by the end of 2024, and at its current pace, it might achieve this on its way to $271.16.

37163042,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=621732,1733205206,U.S. strikes with new tech restrictions to curb China’s AI advancements,"The United States is imposing new export restrictions on China’s semiconductor industry, barring U.S. shipments to 140 companies, which may affect China’s AI advancements. This includes chip equipment maker, Naura Technology Group. In reaction, China has banned U.S. exports of several “dual use” minerals and metals essential to military gear and semiconductors. According to a Reuters report , the United States launched its third such major sweep on Chinese chipmaking since 2018. The new plan imposes restrictions on Chinese chip toolmaking companies such as Piotech, ACM Research, and SiCarrier Technology. The package will limit China’s progress in developing AI-related technology by limiting the transfer of advanced memory chips and additional chip-making tools. The latest effort can decelerate China’s access to technologies that would reinforce its military or compromise U.S. security. The restrictions are especially concerned with chips made to use in artificial intelligence. This also includes other advanced chipmaking equipment that use high bandwidth memory. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo says that this restrictive action would limit China’s semiconductor capability and therefore its military modernization. 20 semiconductor companies, two investment companies, and over 100 AI chip makers are included in the list U.S. companies including Lam Research, KLA, Applied Materials, and Dutch firm ASM International are likely to be impacted. More than 20 semiconductor companies, two investment companies, and over 100 chipmaking toolmakers are included in the list. One is Swaysure Technology, which is tied to Huawei and has already come under severe U.S. sanctions, and another is Shenzhen Pensun Technology. U.S. suppliers also now need special licenses to do business with those firms added to the Entity List. In a regular press briefing on Monday, Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry said these restrictions are against the norms of global trade. They will also disrupt the supply chains. He also added that China will protect the rights of its companies. China has responded to US export restrictions In a new update on Tuesday, December 3rd, China has barred U.S. exports of several “dual use” minerals and metals essential to military gear and semiconductors. According to a recent report by Financial Times, the Chinese commerce ministry said it will stop shipping gallium, germanium, antimony, and superhard materials products to the US. Moreover, it will also increase controls on graphite products. Also, Chinese industry groups in the internet, auto, semiconductor, and communications sectors have also asked their members to reduce buying U.S. semiconductors. China Semiconductor Industry Association said it urged caution in buying “unsafe and unreliable” U.S. chip products. Banned minerals are essential in semiconductors, batteries, communication devices, and military hardware. China is the key to supplying these resources. This includes a total of 98% of the world’s gallium and 60% of germanium.

Peterson, who is known for developing a unique economic metric called the Secular Market Indicator, shared his concerns in a public statement that sparked controversy among investors. Peterson introduced his Secular Market Indicator six years ago in the Journal of Wealth Management. The metric is designed to gauge whether the economy is poised for long-term growth or stagnation, and the analyst claims it offers insights that go beyond traditional tools like the Shiller P/E ratio or the Buffett Indicator. Peterson criticized these older models, claiming they “went bankrupt in 2008” and can’t provide meaningful forecasts today. In contrast, Peterson’s model uses gold as a fundamental variable and treats it as a proxy for tangible assets such as commodities, as opposed to paper-based investments. Related News: XRP Price Nears the $3 Mark - What's Fueling the Mega Rally? Why is XRP Rising? Peterson announced that the Secular Market Indicator was “fully triggered” again for the first time since 2021. He claimed that stocks would not exceed an average annual return of 5% for the next decade and that a major market crash could occur within the next two years. Drawing parallels with past economic crises, Peterson draws attention to the bear markets in 2022, 2008 and 2000. Predicting that the first signs of a decline could appear as early as the summer of 2025, the author warns investors not to underestimate the speed at which such events will occur. Peterson’s bearish outlook also extends to the cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin. He recalled Bitcoin’s performance during previous market crashes, such as the one in 2022, warning that this cycle “may be no different.” *This is not investment advice.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs saw $6.4 billion in November inflows, driven by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust. Marathon Digital invested $600 million in Bitcoin between Oct. 1 and Nov. 30, while MicroStrategy further solidified its position as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder with a 15,400 BTC purchase last week. Silk Road Bitcoin Moved to Coinbase Prime Wallet The United States government moved approximately $1.9 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) that was seized from the Silk Road marketplace to a Coinbase Prime wallet, according to blockchain records and data from Arkham Intelligence . On Dec. 2, a wallet linked to the U.S. government transferred around 19,800 Bitcoin, valued at close to $1.9 billion at the time, to a Coinbase Prime deposit address. This Bitcoin was originally seized during a 2021 investigation into James Zhong, who was later convicted of wire fraud connected to the Silk Road. US Government transferring Bitcoin to Coinbase wallet (Source: Arkham Intelligence ) The Department of Justice announced in 2022 that more than 50,000 Bitcoin were confiscated from Zhong, including some that was stored on a single-board computer hidden under blankets in a popcorn tin. While the authorities have moved many of these coins across wallets, the U.S. government still holds about $18 billion worth of Bitcoin. It remains unclear whether this recent transfer is part of a broader strategy to sell or trade the funds. Discussions among lawmakers, including Senator Cynthia Lummis and President-elect Donald Trump, have raised the idea of establishing a ”strategic Bitcoin reserve” for the United States. The U.S. Marshals Service, which oversees the seizure of cryptocurrencies and other criminal assets, announced a partnership with Coinbase Prime in July for the custody of such tokens. This happened despite Coinbase facing a civil suit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in June of 2023. The Silk Road marketplace was once a hub for illicit transactions involving weapons, drugs, and stolen credit card information, and was dismantled after the arrest of its founder Ross Ulbricht. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole in 2015, and has since received a lot of support from the crypto community for a commutation of his sentence. President-elect Donald Trump also pledged to commute Ulbricht’s sentence on the first day of his second term. Bitcoin ETFs See $6.4 Billion Inflows in November In November, United States investors channeled close to $6.4 billion into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). During this month, Bitcoin’s market price also surged by 45% to reach new highs. The month-long rally saw Bitcoin prices climb from $68,000 to $99,000, thanks to very strong bullish sentiment. Spot BTC ETFs collectively attracted $6.87 billion in investments , offset by outflows that totaled $411 million. Bitcoin ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF dominated the inflows by securing $5.6 billion and accounting for almost 87% of the monthly total. Other major contributors included Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund with $962 million, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF with $211.5 million, and the VanEck Bitcoin ETF with $71.2 million. These figures proved just how much investor confidence in Bitcoin’s price trajectory is growing. Outflows were primarily driven by the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF, which saw $364 million withdrawn, followed by the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF with $40.4 million and the Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund with $6.8 million. Despite these outflows, the market maintained its strong optimism. Crypto fear and greed index (Source: Alternative ) The Crypto Fear & Greed Index also hit a yearly high of 92 on Nov. 22. While the index dipped slightly in December, it still reflects overwhelmingly positive investor confidence. Marathon Digital Invests $600M in Bitcoin ETF investors were not the only ones who stocked up on Bitcoin recently. Marathon Digital invested more than $600 million in Bitcoin over the past two months, according to a filing with the United States SEC on Dec. 2. The company revealed the acquisition of 6,484 Bitcoin between Oct. 1 and Nov. 30 at an average price of $95,352 per BTC. This amounted to a total cost of $618.3 million. Marathon also announced plans to issue $700 million in convertible senior notes due in 2031 through a private offering. The proceeds will be used for additional Bitcoin purchases and repurchasing existing convertible notes due in 2026. Some public companies that own BTC (Source: BiTBO ) As the largest publicly traded crypto mining company by market cap, Marathon Digital is the second-largest corporate Bitcoin holder after MicroStrategy, according to BitcoinTreasuries. On Nov. 26, the company called for the United States to accelerate its Bitcoin accumulation strategy as it believes in the importance of securing Bitcoin reserves for economic and national security. Marathon compared the importance of holding Bitcoin to maintaining gold reserves, and argued that these assets provide stability in the event of declining confidence in the dollar. Despite advocating for Bitcoin accumulation, Marathon sold 63% of its mined Bitcoin in May of 2024, very shortly after Bitcoin’s fourth halving reduced the mining block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. The sale involved 390 Bitcoin out of the 616 BTC that were mined that month. While President-elect Donald Trump promised to add Bitcoin to the U.S. Treasury reserve, some experts, like Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, are skeptical about the likelihood of a Bitcoin strategic reserve being established during his term. MicroStrategy Bought 15,400 BTC in a Week MicroStrategy also boosted its position as a leading corporate Bitcoin holder by buying 15,400 BTC between Nov. 25 and Dec. 1, funded through $1.5 billion raised from a stock sale under its at-the-market equity program. The purchase was completed at an average price of $95,976 per Bitcoin, according to a Dec. 2 filing with the United States SEC. During the same period, MicroStrategy sold 3.7 million shares of its Class A common stock, which generated $1.48 billion in net proceeds to fund the acquisition. As of Dec. 1, MicroStrategy and its subsidiaries hold a total of 402,100 BTC, which is valued at close to $38.4 billion at current market prices. The firm spent $23.4 billion on Bitcoin purchases at an average price of $58,263 per coin, which is a 64% gain on its investments. This latest acquisition happened after an even larger purchase the week prior, when the company bought 55,000 BTC for $5.4 billion at an average price of $97,862. That transaction was funded through a combination of a private offering of 0% convertible senior notes due in 2029 and proceeds from the equity program. In addition to expanding MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings, executive chairman Michael Saylor urged Microsoft to also adopt a similar Bitcoin-centric strategy. Saylor pitched the idea to Microsoft’s board, and claimed the tech giant could increase its market cap by almost $5 trillion by aggressively adopting Bitcoin. He suggested Microsoft convert its dividend payouts, stock buybacks, cash flows, and debt into Bitcoin, which he argued could add hundreds of dollars to the company’s stock price and create trillions of dollars in enterprise value.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6344/bitcoin-worth-billions-transferred-to-coinbase-by-us-government,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

His LinkedIn profile has been updated to include his new role. This promotion comes at a critical moment, just as a more crypto-friendly administration prepares to take office next month, making the shift even more significant for the agency. The crypto industry hopes President-elect Donald Trump’s administration will create clear regulatory guidelines. These rules could support innovation in the cryptocurrency space while ensuring compliance and protecting investors. However, Tenreiro’s history at the SEC points towards continued stringent enforcement of regulations. His new position implies that even with changes in political climate, investor protection and market integrity will still be priorities. Ripple Lawsuit Highlights Jorge Tenreiro’s Influence on SEC’s Crypto Oversight Jorge Tenreiro previously served as Acting Chief of the SEC’s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. He played a key role in shaping the SEC’s crypto enforcement strategy. Under his leadership, the SEC pursued several high-profile cases against crypto firms. Tenreiro played a pivotal role in the SEC’s litigation against Ripple Labs, as well as its executives Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen. Serving as lead counsel, he handled allegations that XRP was an unregistered security. This case has attracted widespread attention and remains central to debates on cryptocurrency regulation. SEC’s Tenreiro Appointment Reinforces Focus on Crypto Enforcement The SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple, initiated in Dec. 2020, alleges that Ripple sold XRP as an unregistered security . This case has become a landmark for US cryptocurrency regulation, questioning how digital assets fit under current securities laws. The SEC has taken a firm stance, arguing that many cryptocurrencies qualify as securities and should face stricter regulation. This position has fueled significant debate, as Ripple’s executives contend that XRP is not a security . Tenreiro’s new role indicates that, despite efforts to encourage crypto innovation, he will maintain strict enforcement of securities laws. His focus will likely remain on ICOs, token offerings and tackling market manipulation in the crypto sector. As chief litigation counsel, Tenreiro will play a key role in shaping landmark crypto regulation cases. His decisions on litigation or settlements could define the legal standards cryptocurrencies must follow, even in a potentially more lenient regulatory environment.

37164413,https://cryptonews.com/?p=315453,1733204422,Sonic Labs Prepares for Public Launch of Sonic Blockchain Following Genesis Milestone,"Sonic Labs has announced the impending public launch of its layer-1 blockchain, Sonic, following the successful completion of its Genesis milestone, marking the creation of the blockchain’s first block. “Genesis achieved. Block zero. Infrastructure deploying. Public soon,” the firm said in a December 2 announcement on X . Sonic is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible blockchain designed for speed, aiming to provide developers with low-latency transactions and reduced fees. Sonic’s Blockchain is a Successor to Fantom Opera Network Described as a successor to the Fantom Opera network, Sonic represents a rebranding effort to enhance performance and user incentives. The project is supported by the Fantom Foundation, which has been pivotal in developing Fantom’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem since 2019. Ahead of its public launch, Sonic introduced “Blaze,” an upgraded testnet, on December 1. Additionally, the platform completed its “Snapshot” for an airdrop allocation of its native “S” tokens on December 2. Around 200 million S tokens, which can be swapped 1:1 with Fantom (FTM) tokens, were distributed through interactive arcade games like Coinflip and Plinko. These games have since concluded as the platform transitions toward its mainnet debut. Sonic’s blockchain operates on a proof-of-stake mechanism, allowing S token holders to participate in staking. Genesis achieved. Block zero. Infrastructure deploying. Public soon. — Sonic Labs (prev. Fantom) (@0xSonicLabs) December 2, 2024 During testnet trials, the blockchain achieved transaction finality in just 720 milliseconds, placing it among the fastest EVM-compatible chains, alongside Solana and Base. The Sonic network is designed to incentivize developers, allocating 90% of generated transaction fees back to them. Andre Cronje, Sonic Labs’ Chief Technology Officer and a former Fantom advisor, emphasized the platform’s goal to become the preferred blockchain for developers. To support the transition from Fantom to Sonic, the Fantom Foundation allocated $120 million in FTM tokens to assist developers in migrating their projects. Earlier this year, the Sonic Foundation was launched to oversee governance, manage the treasury, foster partnerships, and build a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem. Fantom Foundation Pledges $120M to Accelerate Project Migrations to Sonic In June, the Fantom Foundation revealed its plan to allocate up to 200 million of its native Fantom tokens, amounting to approximately $120 million, from its treasury to facilitate the transition of projects to the Sonic network. The pledged funds will be utilized to identify and secure partnerships with top-tier developers and companies capable of contributing to the growth and development of the Sonic network. This includes developers working on applications directly on the Fantom platform, developers focused on decentralized applications (DApps), as well as partners providing essential tools and services. Notably, the funds will be derived from smart financial strategies implemented by Fantom network creator Andre Cronje, without any increase in the total token supply. Initially, the allocated funds will be directed towards strategic grants for existing applications within the Fantom ecosystem, with priority given to those that have demonstrated a strong interest in leveraging the Sonic technology.

37162415,https://coinpaper.com/6345/crypto-analyst-predicts-xrp-doubling-its-all-time-high-price,1733204041,Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Doubling Its All-Time High Price,"The cryptocurrency markets are currently experiencing significant and pivotal developments, particularly as XRP continues to draw considerable attention with its record-breaking gains and heightened institutional interest. Following an astonishing return of 297% in November 2024, XRP has skyrocketed to its highest levels since 2017, igniting a wave of optimism among analysts who are now setting ambitious price targets for the altcoin. This surge in value is not just a fleeting moment; it suggests a broader trend of growing confidence in the cryptocurrency space. In addition, WisdomTree has recently joined the expanding roster of asset managers that are filing for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). This move is in response to the increasing demand for regulated investment products that are directly tied to XRP, indicating a shift in how institutional investors are approaching the cryptocurrency market. As interest continues to build, the landscape for XRP and similar assets is evolving rapidly, promising exciting opportunities ahead. XRP Soars in November, Achieving Record-Breaking Gains Since 2017 XRP, Ripple’s native cryptocurrency, has been the talk of the town in November 2024, registering a monumental 297% monthly return on investment (ROI), its highest since December 2017. The token's November close at $1.95 not only marks a seven-year high but also a decisive breakout above its 2021 peak, solidifying its bullish trajectory. Over the past 24 hours, XRP has surged an additional 14%, further fueling market speculation. Analysts now believe this altcoin has the potential to reach unprecedented levels. Jacob Canfield, an independent crypto trader, has set an ambitious target of $6.60 for XRP, citing Fibonacci extensions and historical performance relative to Bitcoin during previous market peaks. Highlighting Bitcoin’s current value—approximately five times its 2017 price when XRP reached its previous all-time high of $3.40—Canfield explained: “This would put the price around $6.60, exactly 2X the value of its previous high. I think this is probably the ideal FOMO target and would stop thinking double digits or higher and is very logical.” Similarly, Tony Edward, founder of the Thinking Crypto podcast, has placed XRP’s potential target between $5 and $8, while recommending a more conservative profit-taking strategy. Neel, a crypto educator, pointed out that XRP's rally is a signal of increasing retail investor participation, driven by heightened media attention and its appeal to mainstream audiences. On-Chain Data Reveals Whale and Retail Accumulation XRP’s price surge has been mirrored by robust on-chain activity. Data from analytics platform Santiment reveals that XRP wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million tokens have accumulated 679.1 million XRP—valued at $1.6 billion—over the past three weeks. Additionally, the number of non-empty XRP wallets has surpassed 5.5 million for the first time in the cryptocurrency’s eight-year history. This surge in wallet activity suggests a growing interest among both retail investors and whales, further supporting the bullish momentum. XRP’s futures market has also seen remarkable growth, with open interest (OI) reaching a new all-time high of $3.99 billion as of Dec. 2, 2024. This represents a staggering 100% increase from Nov. 28, when OI stood at $2.06 billion. The combination of rising spot accumulation, increased futures activity, and surging trading volumes paints a clear picture of the renewed interest in XRP among traders and investors alike. Ripple's ongoing legal victories and institutional partnerships have contributed to the positive sentiment surrounding XRP. With little resistance remaining on higher time frames, market experts predict a continued upward trend, particularly if XRP can maintain a close above $1.99 by the year’s end. Such a close would mark its highest yearly finish in history, further solidifying its bullish narrative. As XRP’s price and on-chain metrics continue to break records, the altcoin finds itself at a pivotal moment. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic about its trajectory, citing strong fundamentals, increasing adoption, and growing market momentum. Whether XRP can achieve the ambitious targets set by experts like Jacob Canfield and Tony Edward remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: XRP is once again at the forefront of the crypto market, captivating investors and traders worldwide. WisdomTree Files for a Spot XRP ETF, Joining Growing Industry Movement Meanwhile, WisdomTree, a prominent asset manager and one of the first companies to issue a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States earlier this year, has taken another major step in the cryptocurrency space. On Dec. 2, WisdomTree filed a Form S-1 with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot ETF backed by XRP, Ripple's native cryptocurrency. This move positions WisdomTree as the fourth company in the United States to file for a spot XRP ETF, reflecting a burgeoning interest in XRP-based investment products. The proposed fund, named the WisdomTree XRP Fund, is designed to give investors exposure to XRP’s price performance. Shares of the fund are expected to be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange. According to the filing, the fund will create and redeem shares using a cash-create method or in exchange for cash. WisdomTree may explore an in-kind model, which could allow for more efficient share transactions, pending additional approvals from regulatory authorities. In its filing, WisdomTree revealed that affiliates of Coinbase Global, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, will play a pivotal role in the fund's operations. Coinbase will serve as both the XRP custodian and the fund’s prime execution agent, ensuring seamless management of XRP transactions. The filing emphasized Coinbase's critical role in the US spot XRP exchange-traded product ecosystem. WisdomTree has a history of relying on Coinbase for cryptocurrency custody and execution, including its WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW), which debuted alongside other Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 11, 2024. WisdomTree’s filing adds to the growing competition among asset managers vying to launch the first spot XRP ETF in the United States. Three other firms—Bitwise, Canary Capital, and 21Shares—have already submitted their own filings with the SEC. Bitwise: Bitwise was the first to file for a spot XRP ETF, submitting its Form S-1 on Oct. 2. The company is no stranger to the ETF market, having debuted its Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) earlier this year. Canary Capital: Following Bitwise’s lead, Canary Capital filed for the Canary XRP ETF on Oct. 9. The firm has positioned itself as an emerging player in the cryptocurrency investment space. 21Shares: In partnership with ARK Invest, 21Shares filed its Form S-1 for the Core XRP Trust on Nov. 1. Unlike the other ETFs, this trust does not provide direct exposure to XRP but offers investors an opportunity to access the market indirectly. The flurry of XRP ETF filings comes at a pivotal time for Ripple and XRP. XRP recently reclaimed its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, buoyed by its legal victory against the SEC and a series of bullish market developments. The interest in spot XRP ETFs indicates a growing demand for institutional-grade investment products tied to cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin. Analysts believe that a successful launch of a spot XRP ETF could further solidify XRP’s position in the market and attract a broader base of investors. Regulatory Hurdles Remain While the interest in spot XRP ETFs is mounting, the approval process remains uncertain. The SEC has historically been cautious with cryptocurrency ETFs, citing concerns over market manipulation, liquidity, and custody solutions. However, the approval of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year suggests a shift in the SEC’s stance, raising optimism for XRP-focused products. If approved, WisdomTree’s XRP ETF and similar offerings could serve as a significant catalyst for XRP adoption. By providing investors with a regulated and accessible way to invest in XRP, these funds have the potential to drive liquidity, increase market participation, and bolster confidence in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. WisdomTree’s filing for a spot XRP ETF sheds some light on the increasing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin. With several firms now competing for SEC approval, the race to launch the first US spot XRP ETF is heating up. As regulatory developments unfold, the launch of such a product could mark another milestone for both XRP and the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Investors and industry observers will undoubtedly be watching closely as the SEC evaluates these groundbreaking proposals.",POSITIVE,BTC | XRP,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6345/crypto-analyst-predicts-xrp-doubling-its-all-time-high-price,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

However, while the websites are blocked, their apps still work, leaving many questioning how effective this move is. Why the Crackdown? The Cambodian government is under pressure to address its reputation as a hotspot for cybercrime and crypto-related scams. Reports from the UN Office on Drugs & Crime revealed that criminal groups in Cambodia exploit cryptocurrencies for illicit activities, including money laundering and dark web transactions Adding to this, a Chainalysis report highlighted over $49 billion in crypto transactions tied to Huione Guarantee, a key player within the Cambodian conglomerate Huione Group. Cambodia Gov Targeting Unlicensed Platforms The Telecommunication Regulator of Cambodia (TRC) issued a directive on November 20, blocking 102 websites. While many targeted platforms were linked to online gambling, the inclusion of Binance and other major crypto platforms surprised many. The TRC explained that these platforms didn’t have proper licenses from Cambodia’s Securities and Exchange Regulator (SERC). Binance has partnerships in the country, including a 2022 agreement with SERC to assist in developing crypto regulations. Binance also provided training on crypto-related crime detection to Interior Ministry officials in mid-2023. Despite these actions, Cambodia’s relationship with Binance makes the situation more confusing. Limited Licensed Options Currently, only two companies are authorized to operate digital asset businesses under Cambodia’s “FinTech Regulatory Sandbox” program. Even these licensed companies can’t convert digital assets into local or foreign currencies, limiting their use. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Coinbase Leaves Turkey Amidst Tight Regulations , Crypto Demand Remains Strong Despite the crackdown, Cambodia remains a significant player in the global crypto landscape.

37163023,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51226,1733203928,Dogecoin Price Looks to Retarget $1 But Shiba Inu and This New Altcoin Could Pump 500% First,"Dogecoin’s price is gaining momentum to retest the $1 resistance within the next few weeks as traders establish long positions in anticipation of a massive rally. Shiba Inu’s price rallied last week but is now entering a short-term consolidation phase with an 8.74% intraday decline. Meanwhile, analysts are shifting their attention towards low-cap altcoins like Lunex Network (LNEX) amidst the ongoing altseason hype. Since Lunex Network is already poised for 1,800% gains within the next few months, traders are currently rushing to purchase LNEX tokens before the price rallies any further. Dogecoin (DOGE) Prepares to Retest $1 Resistance by Early 2025 Dogecoin’s long accounts have reached the 92 nd percentile over the last 3 months. Dogecoin’s price has also experienced its highest monthly close which is making analysts optimistic about Dogecoin surpassing the $1 milestone. Dogecoin is currently trading for $0.4197 after an intraday crash worth 1.36%. Dogecoin’s RSI and Stochastic RSI are currently in the neutral zone which typically indicates that momentum is gearing up for the next rally. Dogecoin’s volume has also surged by 136.59% over the last 24 hours which suggests high buying pressure. If Dogecoin bulls can push the price towards the nearest resistance at $0.68696, Dogecoin is likely to test the $1 level by early 2025. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Consolidates After Last Week’s Rally Shiba Inu recently reached a new peak at $0.00003 which was its highest level since April. This uptrend was fueled by Shiba Inu’s massive token burn strategy which surged past 7,400% over the last few months. Even whales have shown increased interest in Shiba Inu by accumulating $9.8 million worth of SHIB tokens in a span of two weeks. Alongside this increased investor confidence, Shiba Inu’s Shibarium network has also recorded 541 million transactions in record time. Despite this positive momentum, Shiba Inu’s price has entered a consolidation phase today with a 8.83% decline over the last 24 hours. Shiba Inu is currently trading for $0.0000292 with a minor 5.94% decline in its trading volume. Lunex Network (LNEX) Outshines Memecoin Market with 175% Price Jump Aside from these meme coins, another token that is gaining traction in the crypto DeFi space is Lunex Network (LNEX). By integrating the most attractive features of decentralized and centralized exchanges on a single network, Lunex Network is making it easier for traders to execute cross chain transfers. With the crypto market expected to grow exponentially in 2025, analysts are expecting Lunex Network’s price to skyrocket towards the $1 milestone in early January. The key driver behind Lunex Network’s rapid adoption is the platform’s strategy to integrate the latest Web3 technology on its noncustodial ecosystem. Since Lunex Network has strategically combined features of decentralized and centralized trading, the platform allows traders to make cross chain transfers without having to connect any third party wallets like MetaMask or PhantomWallet. Aside from making trading easier, Lunex Network is also giving investors a consistent source of passive income through its revenue sharing model. Every week, Lunex Network reinvests up to 18% of its exchange revenue into open market buybacks of the LNEX token that are all distributed as staking rewards. Since traders can start earning these rewards in as little as 30 days, both retail and institutional investors are flocking to Lunex Network to purchase tokens before the price skyrockets. Lunex Network’s price has already jumped by 175% from its initial price of $0.0012. Since LNEX tokens are still available for a low price of just $0.0033 each, now is the best time to invest in Lunex Network before the highly anticipated 20x rally before the end of Q4.

Projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu started as jokes but quickly became serious contenders, proving the meme coin revolution is no laughing matter. Recently, Fartcoin and Turbo have joined the hype, and analysts are predicting big things for these quirky coins. But that’s not all. A new player has entered the game: BTFD Coin , a meme coin ready to set the market on fire with its innovative perks and lightning-fast growth. Let’s break it all down and see why BTFD Coin is the hottest thing in crypto right now. BTFD Coin: The Rising Star of Meme Coins BTFD Coin is stealing the show in the meme coin universe. Since its presale launch on November 26, 2024, it’s made massive waves. With a presale starting at $0.000004 per coin and a listing price of $0.0006, BTFD Coin promises juicy returns. Currently, in Stage 6, the presale price is $0.000058, with over $500,000 raised in the first week and 15 billion coins sold. Why’s everyone jumping in? Three words: Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, staking rewards, and an unrivalled community vibe. These features make BTFD Coin more than just a meme coin; it’s a serious investment opportunity. Analysts predict that as the presale journey progresses through its 16 stages, the price will surge further. If you’re still not convinced, here’s a quick math teaser. Suppose you invest $4,000 at Stage 6 at the price of $0.000058 per coin. You’ll snag 69,048,060 BTFD Coins. Once listed at $0.0006, those coins would be worth $41,428.83. That’s a return you don’t want to miss. Fartcoin: From Farts to Fortune? With a name like Fartcoin, you’d think it’s all a joke, but it’s far from that. Fartcoin has quietly been building a dedicated fanbase, thanks to its focus on transparency and community engagement. Trading at $0.000000001471, it’s got a long way to go to compete with the big boys, but its low entry price makes it tempting for those who love high-risk, high-reward plays. While Fartcoin isn’t breaking records like BTFD Coin, it’s carving out a niche with its quirky marketing and active social media buzz. That said, without features like staking or gaming incentives, it feels more like a hit-or-miss bet. Could it blow up? Maybe. But if you’re looking for a safer meme coin with strong ROI potential, BTFD Coin’s presale might be a better shot. Turbo: Speeding Through the Crypto Scene Turbo is the rebel of the meme coin gang. Unlike traditional meme coins, Turbo positions itself as a utility token with actual use cases in decentralised finance. This hybrid identity has made Turbo popular among investors who love memes but also want something tangible. According to a recent article on TechPoint Africa, Turbo’s ecosystem is designed for long-term growth. With solid backing and an active dev team, Turbo is more than just hype. However, it doesn’t have the instant thrill of a low-price entry like BTFD Coin, nor does it offer the same explosive presale momentum. Turbo is a great choice for those who like to play it cool, but if you’re here for the adrenaline, BTFD Coin takes the crown. Why BTFD Coin Stands Out The crypto market is crowded with meme coins, but BTFD Coin is doing things differently. With its unique blend of gaming, staking, and a powerful community, it’s redefining what a meme coin can be. In just over a week, it’s raised more than $500,000 and hit Stage 6 of its presale, selling over 15 billion coins. The buzz around BTFD Coin isn’t just hype. It’s backed by solid growth metrics, an innovative roadmap, and a community that’s in it to win it. If you’re looking for Top Trending Meme Coins This Month, BTFD Coin is the one you can’t afford to miss. Conclusion BTFD Coin is the standout winner among these meme coins. It’s got the growth, the features, and the FOMO factor to make it a top pick. Don’t let this presale slip through your fingers—join the BTFD Coin presale now and ride the wave to potential profits.

37162243,https://coinpedia.org/?p=388270,1733203549,Hedera Continues to Scale Up-Here’s the HBAR Price Prediction for 2025 After a Bullish 2024 Close Above $1,"The post Hedera Continues to Scale Up-Here’s the HBAR Price Prediction for 2025 After a Bullish 2024 Close Above $1 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Hedera (HBAR) price has been rallying gigantically, suggesting a momental shift of attention from the other altcoins towards the token. Hedera Hashgraph, its chain, is considered an alternative to the traditional blockchains that aim to excel in speed, efficiency, and security. With this, the HBAR gains centre stage and remains the top altcoin according to Lunar Crush with the top market and social activity. Now that the HBAR price has erased 1000+ days of downtrend in just four weeks, where will the price find its peak in the ongoing bull run? The sluggish and weak performance of HBAR has irked the market participants, who often complained of poor participation on the governing council. Now that the price has undergone a 7x rally, a new ATH appears to be imminent. But the question arises whether the price rally will remain restricted at $1 or will continue beyond the range, finding new highs in 2025. The long-term price action of HBAR suggests the rally has gained huge momentum and is about to enter the bullish range. The price is about to enter the final resistance zone below the ATH at $0.5701 and also the 0.618 FIB. A rise from these levels does not only help the price form a new ATH but surpass the trend line and enter the bullish range. Besides, the OBV just rose from a prolonged, multi-year stagnant trend with a massive rise in volume. This suggests the price has just begun with the bull run, activating the higher price targets. The next levels to look out above the ATH could be around 1.2 FIB at $0.715 and later at 1.6 FIB at $0.910. These are the important levels to achieve, which may further push the price beyond $1. Meanwhile, the monthly RSI has entered the overbought range and marked the 2021 highs, suggesting a small pullback could sweep out the selling pressure if any. In such cases, 0.5 FIB, the current resistance level between $0.38 and $0.455, may act as a strong support zone, which may further trigger a healthy rebound. Therefore, the Hedera (HBAR) price rally appears to be primed to mark $1, probably in the early few weeks of 2025 and if the market sentiments remain bullish, an extended rally may assist the price to peak at $1.2 to $1.5.",POSITIVE,HBAR,ALTCOIN | MARKET | TRADING | HBAR,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/hedera-continues-to-scale-up-heres-the-hbar-price-prediction-for-2025-after-a-bullish-2024-close-above-1/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Santa Pepe (SANPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Pepe by entering its contract address – 2NefXDdBhUkVn7dXW5wxVtCHKHKE8uiRGUqZGxT5HAN8 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/santa-pepe-sanpepe-solana-memecoin-to-explode-19000-before-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

But what if there is an even bigger opportunity for profits? Now fast attracting interest in the presale stage is Lunex Network (LNEX) , a game-changing decentralized exchange (DEX). Lunex Network is positioned to provide investors not only a chance at strong returns but also a much better DeFi experience as it enhances asset management by smoothly merging cryptocurrencies, equities, bonds, and more. For investors trying to optimize their gains in the coming months, these three players Polygon (POL), VeChain (VET), and Lunex Network could be the next 100x opportunity. Lunex Network (LNEX): The Future of Asset Management Presenting itself as a complete platform simplifying asset administration and transactions, Lunex Network is revolutionizing the DEX sector. Lunex Network aggregates several assets—cryptocurrencies, equities, bonds, ETFs, and more—into one seamless interface, unlike traditional DEXs. By letting investors monitor and manage their whole portfolio from one point of contact, this creative solution simplifies asset management. Focusing on security, efficiency, and simplicity, Lunex Network gives investors the tools they need to focus on optimizing their earnings. With the LNEX token priced at just $0.0033 during its ongoing presale, Lunex Network offers investors an amazing prospect right now. Early adopters who bought LNEX at the initial $0.0012 price have already witnessed an amazing 210% return on investment, therefore demonstrating the platform’s capacity for notable expansion. Now is the ideal time to join the Lunex Network presale and seize this chance for significant rewards given the expected launch price of $0.0216. Moreover, investors are quickly grabbing their slots as more than 2.0 billion tokens have been sold in weeks and over $3.8 million has been raised in presale revenue. Polygon (POL) on the Rise: Can It Reclaim Its All-Time High? Recently, the Polygon price has seen a notable increase— more than 28% in only the past week. The Polygon price suffered negative pressure once it hit the $0.61 mark, which caused a retreat toward the $0.50 support level. But now that the bullish trend is starting to pick up, the Polygon price chart shows that the altcoin is heading into the $0.61 resistance zone. Polygon (POL) has shown a remarkable positive trend during the past month, increasing its price by 70%. This comeback has inspired traders and investors with hope for a possible near-term continuation of increasing momentum. Though trading almost 50% below its ATH of $1.29, attained in March of this year, analysts still see Polygon’s (POL) bright future. They propose that the altcoin might go back to its ATH by the end of 2024 with continuous optimistic momentum. Under this perspective, technical indicators such as the MACD and Moving Averages show positive signals on the Polygon price chart, therefore signifying a robust upward trend. VeChain’s (VET) Bullish Surge: Is a Return to ATH in Sight? With the VeChain price rising by around 30% in the previous week alone, the altcoin has been showing an amazing upward trend that excites investors expecting further gains. The altcoin has seen notable opposition, nevertheless, as the VeChain price moves toward the $0.045 threshold, therefore testing its capacity to keep momentum . VeChain (VET) has seen a notable surge over the past month, exceeding 83%, despite this resistance at $0.045. Though the VeChain price chart shows that the altcoin is still more than 80% below its all-time high (ATH) of $0.278, attained in 2021, this consistent gain has spurred hope in the prospects of VeChain (VET). With the community demonstrating great support for the future of the altcoin, investor sentiment toward VeChain (VET) remains generally positive. Positive momentum shown by technical indicators such as the Momentum Oscillator and Moving Averages on the VeChain price chart also supports ongoing optimism. Lunex Network, Polygon, and VeChain Aim For Huge Gains With their remarkable price swings, Polygon (POL) and VeChain (VET) are attracting investor interest; Lunex Network (LNEX) is the undiscovered gem with possibly large rewards.

However, analysts are still bullish on the token, seeing it as a buying opportunity. At the same time, Stellar and a new altcoin, Cutoshi , have seen huge growth. Solana Dip Provides Great Entry Point Solana (SOL) has been one of the top performers this cycle. However, a recent correction shook up the token, leading to a drop in its rankings. Solana is down 10% in the last seven days, from $253 to $227. The big news this week was that Ripple (XRP) surpassed Solana in market cap. After XRP reached $2, it overtook both Solana and Tether (USDT), reaching the third spot among all crypto assets. This came as a shock to Solana traders, as SOL struggled to overtake Tether. Source: Barchart Despite this setback, analysts are bullish on Solana. For instance, Rekt Capital suggests that Solana could reach $300 by 2025 if it confirms support at $250. With a relative strength index (RSI) at a comfortable 51, Solana is in a strong position to grow. However, other indicators are mixed, with an overall neutral outlook . Stellar Sees Huge Gains Stellar (XRM) has seen huge growth in recent weeks, being one of the best performers in that period. The token saw a 478.36% increase in the last 30 days, on news that institutions are looking into Stellar. The catalyst for the growth was, besides the crypto market rally, a recent filing by Grayscale Investments. The filing revealed that the company’s XLM trust recorded a 10% increase in net assets during the financial year. This indicates strong institutional interest in Stellar. Source: CMC The reaction to the news was strong, with traders bidding up the token to new highs. Jed McCaleb, a founder of Stellar, shared why he thinks the growth came. He pointed out that Stellar does 10x daily transactions compared to Ethereum and called it one of the most underrated projects so far. A lot of new people looking at Stellar so I thought I'd write down some quick thoughts about why Stellar is worth your time. IMHO Stellar is the most underrated and least understood crypto project. A lot of recent attention but people are still sleeping on this network. Stellar… — Jed McCaleb (@JedMcCaleb) November 23, 2024 Still, this huge growth can’t last forever and analysts now believe that Stellar will go into a retracement period . However, if it breaks the resistance at $0.60, the token could test $0.70 soon. On the other hand, if it falls below $0.40 support, it will likely decline to $0.28 or $0.22. Cutoshi Showcases Interest In DeFi Stellar’s huge growth indicates that investors are looking into projects with strong DeFi utility. The recent interest in the memeFi token Cutoshi (CUTO) boosts this case. In under a month since its launch, the token raised more than a million in investments. By December 2nd, Cutoshi’s presale investments reached $1.221 million, showcasing the interest in DeFi projects. Notably, while Cutoshi has a cat mascot, it focuses on building a DeFi ecosystem run by its users. The project is building a multichain DEX, with the goal of breaking down barriers to trading. The blend of memes and DeFi aims to make DeFi accessible to more investors than ever. As the crypto market is in a bullish phase, this is an ideal time for traders to start using decentralized platforms like Cutoshi and keep custody over their coins. Stage 4 of the CUTO presale is now live with tokens available for $0.031. The Cyber Monday 20% Bonus is also live for 48 hours.

This regulatory progression has intensified market speculation about the stablecoin’s potential mechanisms and strategic positioning within the cryptocurrency landscape. Market analysts and community commentators have proposed intriguing scenarios regarding the potential backing and deployment of RLUSD. Some prominent voices in the XRP community have suggested a novel approach involving Ripple’s substantial XRP escrow holdings as a financial instrument for the stablecoin’s initial reserve strategy. According to market commentator Del Crypto, one speculative scenario involves Ripple using its XRP escrow to establish initial reserves. 911 Alert: $XRP Rumors are swirling thru the cryptosphere that @Ripple might custody its entire $XRP escrow and use it to establish the initial reserve for $RLUSD . If true, this move would enable @Ripple to mint $RLUSD , sell it to ODL partners, and unlock substantial working… — Del Crxpto (@DelCrxpto) December 2, 2024 Vincent Van Code, another prominent community figure, weighed in on this hypothetical strategy, noting that it could enable Ripple to mint RLUSD and distribute it to On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) partners while generating substantial working capital for the company. Potential Ecosystem Implications The proposed strategy could potentially generate significant advantages for the XRP Ledger ecosystem. Theoretically, the approach might introduce enhanced liquidity, manage XRP’s circulating supply, and create additional economic dynamics within the cryptocurrency market. The speculation has coincided with a notable price surge for XRP, which recently hit a peak of $2.8487, and is trading at $2.71, with a 40.05% increase over the past 24 hours. This price movement has pushed XRP to heights not seen since 2018, and positioned it as the third-largest cryptocurrency, surpassing competitors like Solana, BNB, and USDT. Van Code believes this strategy could help XRP climb, potentially reaching $1,000. Other experts have recently expressed confidence in this target, but there are some crucial considerations to this rumored strategy. Regulatory Considerations for this Approach Ripple initially promised a different approach to how RLUSD would be backed. Regulators may not like this approach proposed by Del Crypto. The company’s announcement explicitly stated that RLUSD would be backed exclusively by USD deposits, short-term U.S. government treasuries, and cash equivalents. This official stance contrasts with the more speculative community discussions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Prominent XRP community member WrathofKahneman urged caution regarding unverified rumors, emphasizing the potential regulatory challenges of using XRP or any cryptocurrency as collateral for RLUSD. One community member noted that regulatory bodies traditionally prefer established, low-volatility assets for stablecoin reserves. This could potentially complicate the rumored backing strategies. Instead, he proposed a unique approach, suggesting potential frameworks, where traditional cash-backed tokenization could coexist with cryptocurrency-adjacent reserve mechanisms. Considering that regulatory approval is the only roadblock left for RLUSD’s launch, Ripple must navigate these complex backing issues to get the stablecoin through regulators.

37161681,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656337,1733202021,"Ethereum Risk-Reward Ratio Is Now Attractive, Brokerage Firm Explains","Ethereum (ETH) now offers an attractive risk-reward ratio, according to analysts at research and brokerage firm Bernstein. Despite underperforming compared to other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP for most of 2024, Ethereum’s strong fundamentals may set the stage for a potential rally. Why Is Ethereum Struggling? Bernstein Analysts Explain Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap exceeding $430 billion, may be on the verge of significant positive price action. Bernstein analysts suggest that ETH’s fundamentals remain strong despite its underperformance , making it an appealing investment opportunity. To put Ethereum’s performance into perspective, on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, Bitcoin and Solana have surged 125% and 122%, respectively, while ETH has only managed a 57% increase. In a client note shared today, analysts led by Gautam Chhugani highlighted several factors contributing to Ethereum’s struggles. One issue is that ETH has not established itself as a store of value to the same extent as BTC. Additionally, the leading smart contract platform faces increasing competition from low-latency Layer 1 blockchains such as Solana, Sui, and Aptos. The note also pointed out that Ethereum’s reliance on Layer 2 blockchains, including Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base, often redirects users away from Ethereum’s main chain. This hampers user retention and limits transaction fee growth, creating a headwind for ETH’s price momentum. Is Now The Right Time To Buy ETH? Bernstein analysts argue that Ethereum’s outlook could improve substantially, particularly in light of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s recent election victory. Following Trump’s win, the total cryptocurrency market cap has surged over 45%, surpassing $3.5 trillion. Ethereum has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of this rally, gaining 46% since the election compared to Bitcoin’s 41% and Solana’s 36%. The analysts also noted key developments that could support Ethereum’s growth moving forward. They highlighted the increasing likelihood of staking yield approval in Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) under a Trump-led, crypto-friendly Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The analysts explained: We believe, under a new Trump 2.0 crypto-friendly SEC, ETH staking yield will likely be approved. The analysts added that Ethereum’s current yield rate of 3% could increase to as high as 4% to 5%, which could be an attractive yield rate for investors in a declining interest rate environment. Further, the recently observed growth in Ethereum ETFs in the form of higher inflows could benefit ETH. Although ETH ETFs had a lukewarm launch, they have recently outperformed Bitcoin ETFs in daily inflows. For instance, on November 29, spot ETH ETFs in the US attracted $332.9 million in inflows, compared to $320 million for Bitcoin ETFs. In addition, Ethereum’s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm in September 2023 and the protocol’s burn mechanism have stabilized ETH’s total supply around 120 million. Of these, about 28% is tied in staking contracts while roughly 10% is in lending protocols or Layer 2 bridges. With a high proportion – close to 60% – of total ETH supply unmoved in the past year, the analysts at Bernstein believe the digital asset might benefit from favourable demand-supply dynamics. At press time, ETH trades at $3,644, down 1.8% in the past 24 hours.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | SOL,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/ethereum-risk-reward-ratio-is-now-attractive-brokerage-firm-explains/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/37161681.jpeg

Yet, that’s exactly what happened in Turkey. Coinbase, which had big plans for the country just three months ago, suddenly called it quits. So, what went wrong? The answer lies in Turkey’s increasingly tough stance on crypto regulation, and Coinbase isn’t the only one feeling the heat. Turkey’s New Crypto Rules Are Shaking Things Up Turkey’s regulators recently tightened the rules for cryptocurrency firms, making life a lot harder for companies like Coinbase. The country’s Capital Markets Board listed Coinbase as one of 14 companies liquidating their operations. At the same time, some big names like Binance and KuCoin are still pushing through the process, though they’ve had to scale back. To comply, Binance and KuCoin removed Turkish language support and cut marketing to local users. That’s a pretty big deal when you think about it. Imagine running a global business but having to pull back in one of your key regions. It seems like the exchange decided it just wasn’t worth the hassle. Coinbase Has Other Problems to Tackle This isn’t the only challenge the exchange is dealing with right now. Over in Europe, they stopped offering USDC yield programs, blaming new EU regulations. On top of that, Coinbase plans to delist Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) by December 19, 2024. That decision surprised a lot of people, considering their other token, cbBTC, is doing great in the DeFi world with a $1.44 billion market cap. Back in the U.S., Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong is focusing on policy. He’s reportedly been chatting with politicians about appointing crypto-friendly leaders, including suggesting Hester Peirce as a replacement for SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Whether that will change anything is anyone’s guess, but it shows the exchange is playing the long game. What’s Next for Coinbase? Here’s the thing: Bitcoin’s rally is bringing retail investors back in droves. In November, Coinbase’s app ranking jumped to ninth place globally. That’s a big win for the exchange, even as they face regulatory challenges. For Coinbase, leaving Turkey might be more about focusing on easier markets. But will this strategy help them stay on top? Or will these constant hurdles take a toll?

For those who missed the boat, the Qubetics ($TICS) presale is creating a new buzz in the market, combining utility and innovation in a way no blockchain project has before. As Ethereum inches closer to the psychologically significant $4,000 mark and Aave redefines decentralised finance (DeFi) with a return to bullish momentum, Qubetics is carving its niche with a decentralised VPN (dVPN) service that addresses the shortcomings of traditional networks. With over $4.1 million raised and $TICS tokens priced at just $0.0257 in the 10th presale stage, this emerging crypto powerhouse is sparking investor excitement worldwide. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionising Privacy with Decentralised VPN Qubetics stands out in the blockchain space by addressing one of the internet’s most pressing issues: privacy and secure communication. Its decentralised VPN (dVPN) integrates seamlessly into the Qubetics ecosystem, offering end-to-end encryption, zero-logging policies, and multi-hop routing. Imagine a world where your data isn’t just secured—it’s inaccessible to centralised authorities or prying eyes. Unlike conventional VPNs that rely on central servers, Qubetics’ dVPN leverages blockchain technology to distribute data through a network of nodes. These nodes, incentivised via $TICS tokens, ensure a decentralised, trustless connection. For businesses, this translates into secure communication channels without the risk of breaches. For individuals, it means browsing and streaming without surveillance or data selling. The utility doesn’t stop there. Qubetics’ smart contract-based selection process ensures fairness in allocating VPN nodes, making it an ideal choice for privacy-conscious users. Whether you’re an entrepreneur seeking secure cross-border communications or a casual user wanting to stay anonymous, Qubetics dVPN is a game-changer. Qubetics Presale is turning heads in its 10th stage, where over 259 million $TICS tokens have already found homes with 4,600+ holders, raising an impressive $4.1 million. At just $0.0257 per token, the potential here is electrifying. Analysts predict $TICS will soar to $0.25 by the presale’s end, promising an 871% ROI. But here’s the real kicker: with forecasts pointing to $15 post-mainnet launch, a $5,000 investment today could transform into a jaw-dropping $750,000. But the presale isn’t slowing down. Prices will jump by 10% in the 11th stage, with even higher gains expected as the project approaches its mainnet launch. For savvy investors, this is a FOMO-worthy opportunity. Ethereum (ETH): The March Toward $4,000 Ethereum has been on a tear, breaking the $3,454 resistance last week and gaining nearly 3.5% in just four days. Now hovering around $3,691, it’s clear that ETH bulls have their eyes set on the coveted $4,000 milestone. What’s driving this momentum? The combination of rising DeFi activity, increasing adoption of Ethereum Layer-2 solutions, and improving on-chain metrics are creating a perfect storm. The daily RSI currently reads 68, indicating bullish momentum without being overbought—an ideal scenario for further gains. If Ethereum can hold $3,454 as a support level, a rally to $4,000 seems inevitable. However, failure to sustain this level could see ETH revisiting $3,335, providing a potential entry point for investors waiting on the sidelines. Either way, Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the blockchain industry, with its smart contract functionality and ongoing upgrades making it indispensable for dApps, NFTs, and DeFi platforms. Aave (AAVE): DeFi’s Comeback Kid Aave has proven its resilience, breaking above the $200 resistance on November 27 to signal the resumption of its uptrend. Despite a brief dip to $194, the price bounced back to $209.50, indicating strong support at the $200 mark. Aave’s journey mirrors the broader DeFi resurgence. With a growing total value locked (TVL) and increasing adoption, Aave continues to solidify its position as a market leader. The AAVE/USDT pair shows promising signs on both daily and 4-hour charts, with buyers actively defending critical support levels like the 20-EMA. If Aave maintains momentum and clears $215, analysts project a rally toward $260 in the near term. However, a break below $194 could signal a pullback to the 20-day EMA at $183. For investors eyeing long-term growth, Aave’s innovative approach to decentralised lending and borrowing offers a compelling case. Conclusion As Ethereum edges closer to $4,000 and Aave continues its DeFi dominance, Qubetics offers a unique opportunity to invest in a transformative project still in its early stages. With its decentralised VPN, user-friendly wallet, and commitment to privacy, Qubetics is poised to redefine how we interact with blockchain technology. Investors who act now can join the 4,600+ token holders enjoying early-stage prices at $0.0257 per $TICS. With potential ROIs exceeding 58,000% post-mainnet launch, the upside is hard to ignore.

37164412,https://cryptonews.com/?p=315445,1733199256,Coinbase CEO Promises to Cut Ties With Law Firms Linked to Biden Admin’s ‘Bad’ Actors,"Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong warned Tuesday that the exchange will cut ties with law firms connected to officials involved in “bad deeds” under the Biden administration. In a post on X, Armstrong noted that some senior law firm partners are unaware of the crypto community’s anger over the administration’s actions. He warned that if these firms hire those responsible, Coinbase will end their partnership. Armstrong cited law firm Milbank as an example. The firm recently hired Gurbir Grewal, who left his role as head of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement after three years, as a partner in its New York office. As a result, Armstrong stated that Coinbase has ended its relationship with the firm. “We don’t work with them now (and never will while he works there),” he said. “It’s an ethics violation in my book to try and unlawfully kill an industry while refusing to publish clear rules.

Prominent cases included lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance. The allegations claimed these platforms operated without adhering to federal securities laws, denying investors important protections. Meanwhile, the industry argued that Grewal and the SEC relied on “regulation by enforcement,” choosing to define industry standards through lawsuits instead of establishing clear regulatory guidelines. Many viewed this approach as excessively punitive and lacking in practical guidance for compliance. Under Grewal’s leadership, the SEC maintained that many crypto tokens qualified as securities, using the Howey Test as the basis for this classification. However, critics argued that this broad interpretation stifled innovation by failing to account for the varied nature of digital assets.

Data from Santiment reveals Ripple’s ( XRP ) active wallet addresses shot up over 116,000, helping XRP’s price rally by over 15% in 24 hours. The fourth-largest cryptocurrency’s market cap hit $155.69 billion, a record high on Dec. 3. The trading volume of the token is up by 93.29% in 24 hours. The massive rally that XRP has been witnessing in the post-U.S. elections era is due to a higher investor momentum reflecting more participation from retail investors than whales.

This behavior is an indication that whales are chary of adding positions in the market, which is starting to limit the rally’s strength. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence chart from TradingView , a key technical tool for analyzing the price movement, indicates a recent bearish crossover as the signal line crosses the MACD line.

The daily profit-to-loss ratio recently hovered around 0.374, meaning more investors are selling than buying the token. A low number for daily profit-to-loss during a rally indicates hesitation for traders to enter into long positions. This reading, coupled with the bearish MACD crossover, implies that further XRP price upticks might be hard for the token to make. Challenges to sustain XRP’s positive rally At press time, XRP is trying to break out from its downward rally in the last hour. The divide between retail-driven network growth and the cautious outlook observed by institutional investors is making it harder for the token to continue its upward movement, even as WisdomTree has filed for a spot XRP ETF . If institutional buyers can expect a positive development for XRP from the regulatory body , they may increase liquidity in the market, which can push XRP prices higher.

37160457,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=621705,1733198566,OpenAI may be open to using advertising to raise revenue from its ChatGPT,"OpenAI, the company responsible for ChatGPT, is reportedly playing around with the potential of introducing advertising as a new revenue stream for its AI tool. If it went forward with this plan, it would be a complete reversal from its initial premise for one of the world’s most valuable AI companies. OpenAI’s Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Friar, confirmed that the company is open to exploring advertisement as a way to increase revenue in a recent interview with the Financial Times. According to her, OpenAI does not have any immediate plans to implement ads. She also added that the company is still committed to being “considerate” about when and where ads might appear. OpenAI raised $6.6 billion in October as the Microsoft-backed AI firm’s value went above $150 billion. The company has also found success with its popular ChatGPT. The AI chatbot reportedly has over 250 million active weekly users. Still, the company faces questions about profitability, which has brought on significant financial pressures for many other AI firms. Operating and scaling advanced AI models is expensive, with projected costs for 2024 expected to exceed $5 billion. This year, OpenAI has hired advertising specialists from major tech players like Meta and Google. Kevin Weil, OpenAI’s Chief Product Officer, has extensive experience in ad-supported platforms, having helped develop Instagram’s advertising model. Similarly, Shivakumar Venkataraman, a former leader of Google’s search advertising team, joined the firm earlier this year. OpenAI is exploring its options with advertisement plan For a long time, tech giants like Google and Meta have made money through advertising. However, OpenAI executives are still unsure how to add ads without hurting the user experience. CEO Sam Altman is said to be warming up to the idea, but Friar has pointed out that ad models can bring problems like economic sensitivity and a possible shift in focus from users to advertisers. OpenAI currently makes most of its money from enterprise licensing, paid ChatGPT tiers, and its API, which developers use to create apps based on OpenAI’s models. These revenue sources have been good for substantial amounts, but they may still not be sufficient to offset the company’s huge operational expenditures in the long term. If it eventually decides to move forward with its plan, the company risks upsetting a user base that appreciates ChatGPT’s no ad experience and simple design. It could offer insights into why the company is adding advertising stalwarts to its roster as it carefully balances profitability with innovation. What the future holds for AI With its success, OpenAI is certainly one of the trendsetters in the AI space. While Friar assured users that the company does not have any imminent plans to introduce ads, the suggestion was enough to let speculation linger. The move toward ads could put the company in competition with smaller AI companies like Perplexity , which is already testing ads in its products. If OpenAI eventually goes the ads route, it could radically change the revenue generation template for AI firms. If implemented, the ads may take innovative forms, such as AI-powered personalized suggestions, rather than traditional banner ads seen on legacy platforms. Still, the move won’t be straightforward. Targeted ads often rely on user data, which is a touchy subject for AI users and data privacy regulators, especially in Europe. OpenAI would have to address these worries if it moves forward with this model. If Friar is to be taken by her words, advertising for now remains an idea, not a commitment. However, hiring ad experts like Shivakumar Venkataraman and Kevin Weil may hint at the company giving it a considerable level of thought.

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MRDOGE.

This initiative is part of a broader goal to reach $21 billion in funding through fixed-income securities by 2027. The most recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), shows that the company acquired 15,400 Bitcoin from November 25 to December 1, at an average price of about $95,976 per token. Since November 11, the company has invested over $13.5 billion in BTC in three batches, bringing its total holdings to approximately $38 billion, or 402,100 BTC as of today, at an average purchase price of $56,658 per coin. Crypto Mining Firms Shift Strategies MicroStrategy’s aggressive purchasing strategy has attracted attention from other companies looking to replicate its success. For instance, MARA Holdings , a cryptocurrency mining company, announced on Monday that it had acquired $618 million worth of Bitcoin over the past two months. The company is also pursuing a $700 million convertible senior note offering, with plans to allocate some of the net proceeds towards further Bitcoin purchases. This trend is notable, particularly as crypto mining stocks have struggled this year, especially after the Halving of Bitcoin rewards in April. This event has prompted miners like MARA to adopt a treasury strategy focused on accumulating Bitcoin rather than selling it. Despite experiencing a 44% drop earlier this year, MARA’s shares have rebounded and are currently up 8% year-to-date. Similarly, Riot Platforms, another mining company , has announced plans to temporarily halt the sale of mined BTC in order to increase its holdings after seeing its share value drop 20% this year, following a significant 59% drop in September. At the time of writing, the market’s leading cryptocurrency is trading at $95,180, down 1.6% in the 24-hour time frame. This has been a continuous pattern over the past 10 days, as the BTC price has been consolidating between $91,000 and $98,000, failing to retest its record high of $99,540 and the evasive $100,000 milestone.

The cryptocurrency is now heading toward its next major price targets. However, in the short term, XRP is experiencing resistance. XRP Breaks Above $2 and Faces Resistance Over the past day, XRP has experienced a significant price increase, surpassing $2. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, once XRP breaks above this level, it tends to make a swift move upwards. The next key level of resistance is $2.50, which XRP has already approached. If XRP can successfully push past $2.50, the next target will likely be $2.75, based on previous price action from January 2018, when XRP experienced key weekly closes in that range. However, at the time of writing, XRP is up by more than 11 percent and is trading at $2.73 levels. $3 Target: Psychological and Fibonacci Resistance Looking further ahead, the next significant price target for XRP is $3. This level represents both a psychological resistance and a key Fibonacci extension point, specifically the 1.618 level. The $3 mark is often viewed as a milestone for many traders, and it is highly likely that XRP will face resistance at this level. However, before reaching $3, XRP needs to break through the resistance zones at $2.50 and $2.75. These are critical levels that could determine whether the cryptocurrency will continue its upward trend or face a potential pullback. Support Levels in Case of Pullback In the event of a pullback, there are two major support levels that traders will be watching closely. The first is at $2, which has already shown some strength as a support level. If XRP were to experience a deeper correction, the next support level would be around $1.60, a level where previous resistance is likely to turn into support.",POSITIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-december-3/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

TRON (TRX) TRON (TRX) is a decentralized blockchain-based operating system developed by the Tron Foundation and launched in 2017. Initially deployed as ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum, TRX tokens moved to their own network in 2018. The platform was created to give full ownership rights to digital content creators, enabling them to receive direct rewards from consumers without intermediaries like YouTube or Facebook. TRON supports smart contracts, various blockchain systems, and decentralized applications (dApps). It uses a transaction model similar to Bitcoin’s UTXO, with transactions recorded on a public ledger. By providing a platform for developers to create dApps and share content openly without significant transaction fees, TRON aims to build a decentralized internet.

37159351,https://nulltx.com/?p=135078,1733195758,Top 3 Altcoins Ready to Explode: Don’t Miss Out on These Gems,"The crypto world is buzzing, and for a good reason. Analysts are predicting some major price moves after the latest developments in blockchain technology. If you’ve been waiting for the right time to jump into the altcoin market, this is it. Leading the pack is Qubetics ($TICS), a groundbreaking project with real-world utility that’s set to skyrocket after its mainnet launch. Joining it on this list are two crypto heavyweights—Ethereum and Solana. Let’s explore why these three altcoins are must-haves for your portfolio right now. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): Transforming Real-World Asset Ownership Qubetics isn’t your average altcoin—it’s a revolution in blockchain. At the heart of Qubetics lies Real World Asset Tokenisation (RWAT), a game-changing application that allows individuals and businesses to tokenise assets like real estate, art, and even machinery. Picture this: A family inherits a house but needs cash. Instead of selling outright, they tokenise it on Qubetics, letting multiple investors buy fractions. Everyone wins—the family keeps part of the property, and investors get a piece of prime real estate. It’s modern finance, simplified. Right now, Qubetics is in its 11th presale stage, with tokens priced at $0.0282. Over $4.1 million has already been raised, and excitement is growing as analysts predict a potential surge to $15 after the mainnet launch. To put that into perspective, investing $1,000 today could skyrocket to an incredible $530,000. Opportunities like this don’t come around often—don’t miss your chance! 2. Ethereum (ETH): The Unstoppable Smart Contract Giant Ethereum has been the backbone of blockchain innovation for years, and it’s not slowing down. With its smart contract functionality, Ethereum powers decentralised finance (DeFi), NFTs, and thousands of decentralised apps (dApps). Ethereum’s transition to Ethereum 2.0 has made it faster, cheaper, and more scalable. That’s a win-win for developers and users. Whether you’re minting NFTs or trading on DeFi platforms, Ethereum is the go-to network. As we head into 2025, analysts predict Ethereum’s price could soar past $4,500, making it a solid long-term investment. The upcoming Danksharding upgrade promises even more scalability, ensuring Ethereum’s dominance in the crypto world. 3. Solana (SOL): The Speed Demon of Blockchain Solana is the Usain Bolt of cryptocurrencies. With its lightning-fast transaction speeds and low fees, it’s become a favourite for developers and traders alike. Solana’s blockchain can handle 65,000 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest in the game. This speed is why Solana is dominating sectors like gaming, NFTs, and DeFi. Imagine a world where gaming rewards are instant, NFT trades are cheap, and DeFi doesn’t feel like pulling teeth. That’s Solana for you. Analysts predict Solana’s price could hit $300 in the next bull run. With its ever-expanding ecosystem, Solana is a must-watch for investors looking for high growth potential. If speed, efficiency, and innovation are your thing, Solana is your coin. Its tech is unmatched, and its ecosystem is booming. Don’t sleep on it. Conclusion: Who is the Star of the Show? While Ethereum and Solana bring innovation and speed, Qubetics stands out as the ultimate game-changer. Its ability to revolutionise real-world asset ownership puts it miles ahead of the competition. With its presale price increasing every weekend, the time to act is now. Secure your stake in the future of blockchain. Opportunities like this don’t come twice—don’t be the one left behind.

37159154,https://coinpedia.org/?p=388221,1733195162,"Top Crypto Picks: Why Stellar, Polkadot, and Rollblock Are Hot Buys Right Now","The post Top Crypto Picks: Why Stellar, Polkadot, and Rollblock Are Hot Buys Right Now appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Q4 hype has shone a light on many underdogs, right from Stellar Lumens’ cross-remittance network trailing close to XRP’s success and the interoperable metaprotocol Polkadot—it’s been a hot season. However, the standout among the best crypto to buy now has been the new GambleFi brilliance of Rollblock. Rollblock is making waves in the GambleFi sector, integrating gaming and DeFi with a unique revenue-sharing model. So, sit tight as we explore the best crypto to buy now as another bull run nears. Why Rollblock’s GambleFi revolution makes RBLK the best crypto to buy now The global online gambling industry is worth over $500 billion annually, while DeFi boasts over $118 billion in total value locked. Rollblock sits at the powerful intersection of these two booming sectors. This iGaming ingenuity introduces a revolutionary GambleFi token that combines blockchain innovation with the appeal of online gaming. Unlike many blockchain projects that rely on promises, Rollblock has already delivered. Its Ethereum-based play-to-earn casino is live, offering more than 7,000 gaming titles. At the core of Rollblock’s success is its deflationary tokenomics. With a fixed supply of one billion tokens, RBLK is safeguarded against inflation, making it inherently more valuable over time. Beyond scarcity, RBLK holders can capitalize on lucrative opportunities like staking and a passive income stream that analysts predict is the best crypto to buy now. Over $6.7M raised during its presale and a price surge of 350% demonstrate the market’s confidence in this project. Stellar Lumens gains institutional interest. XLM price eyes further uptick Stellar Lumens has also been making waves as an excellent pick for the best crypto to buy now. The XLM price hasn’t failed to impress. After a 170% surge to a yearly high of $0.55, analysts are already eyeing a retest of its May 2021 ATH of $0.79. Stellar’s ecosystem expansion has also been impressive. Record-breaking DeFi TVL and real-world asset tokenization underpin the XLM price rally. Regulatory clarity in the U.S. and speculation about a spot XLM ETF in 2025 add further momentum. While overbought conditions on the RSI hint at potential corrections, a weekly close above $0.50 could validate a bullish engulfing pattern that could pave the way for more XLM price gains. Polkadot 2.0 and rising stablecoin adoption. Why DOT is another best crypto to buy now Polkadot is also stealing the spotlight as it delivers a double punch of rising stablecoin adoption and the upcoming Polkadot 2.0 upgrade. Right now, the DOT price is breaking new highs, and it’s now experiencing a massive 132% MoM surge above $9. USDC and USDT adoption has surged, with their combined value exceeding $120 million—a testament to Polkadot’s scalability and low transaction costs. The real buzz surrounding the Polkadot 2.0 upgrade has been deafening, too. Key upgrades like Async Backing, Agile Coretime, and Elastic Scaling have promised to pave the way for a better DeFi on Polkadot. Conclusion The crypto market is heating up. Stellar, Polkadot, and Rollblock are proving themselves to be standout opportunities for savvy investors. However, Rollblock shines brightest among the trio, seamlessly merging the $500 billion online gambling industry with DeFi’s immense potential. So, don’t just watch the market evolve—be part of it. Rollblock is currently in presale and selling for just $0.037. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

37164411,https://cryptonews.com/?p=315300,1733194800,Russian Expert: How BRICS Could Affect Global Crypto Markets,"BRICS payment plans could affect global crypto markets, a Russian expert has claimed, adding that Bitcoin (BTC) popularity would nonetheless remain high in the short term. In an opinion piece for RBC , Fedor Ivanov, Director of Analytics at the crypto security provider Shard claimed that stablecoins could be the hardest hit. BRICS Could Affect Crypto Markets: Expert Explains At the recent BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia, leaders agreed to work on the so-called BRICS Bridge platform. The platform, leaders say, will be a fiat cross-border payment system that makes use of wholesale CBDCs and blockchain technology . Donald Trump warned the so-called BRICS nations that he would require commitments that they would not move to create a new currency as an alternative to using the US dollar and repeated threats to levy a 100% tariff https://t.co/pA5RF7Yc9E — Bloomberg (@business) November 30, 2024 BRICS leaders say the platform will “simplify and speed up international payments” for member states. This will, in theory, let them slash transaction costs and cut out intermediaries from the traditional banking system. It would also let the BRICS states bypass banking messaging systems like SWIFT and stop denominating trade in US dollars. BRICS leaders and other senior officials at the 2024 BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia. (Source: President.az [CC BY 4.0]) Ivanov wrote: “If cross-border settlements start making use of CBDCs, this could have an impact on the crypto markets, especially the stablecoin market.” The expert noted that there is an “obvious demand” for the BRICS’ new “instrument.” He wrote: “In November 2024, Tether “printed” 12 billion USDT tokens. And it is unlikely that all the demand for the coin is associated exclusively with the Bitcoin rally. USDT is used in trading not only by Russia. It was also openly discussed in Venezuela.” The BRICS group now accounts for 45% of the world's population and 35% of its economy, based on purchasing power parity, though China accounts for over half of its economic might 2/8 pic.twitter.com/VACMDofOAQ — Reuters (@Reuters) October 22, 2024 USDT Affected? The expert noted that according to “rumors,” USDT is “also used for transactions with Iranian oil,” adding that “despite the issuer’s tightening of compliance,” the “demand for the coin has not yet fallen.” The widespread use of CBDCs at a state level may lead to a decrease in BRICS nations’ interest in stablecoins. He argued that “users may prefer more stable, regulated digital assets that do not risk being frozen for political reasons.” Ivanov said that should they successfully launch CBDCs, BRICS countries may soon “reduce their use of stablecoins,” adding: “They will have access to more convenient and secure alternatives for settlements.” Putin to reject Trump’s opening peace offer, says Russian tycoon https://t.co/9Q29yTBCks — Financial Times (@FT) December 2, 2024 Bitcoin Not in Danger However, Ivanov said, high-cap cryptoassets “such as Bitcoin” will “still remain attractive to investors looking for decentralized solutions.” He conceded that settlements made in “national currencies” were “still not going as we would like.” “In order for the introduction of CBDCs to have a real impact on the crypto markets, a significant portion of transactions will need to switch to digital fiats. And this is unlikely to happen anytime soon.” Fedor Ivanov, Director of Analytics at Shard Ivanov added that it was worth noting that “the largest countries that are actively implementing CBDC, namely China, Russia, India, and Saudi Arabia” were “themselves very wary of cryptocurrencies.” He said that the nationwide launch of a CBDC in these nations could “entail a direct ban on the circulation of cryptocurrencies, as has already happened in China.” My latest: #China has sent officials to the Russian central bank to study the effects of Western sanctions for a better understanding of how it would be affected if it were to invade Taiwan. https://t.co/ttmtZgU37l — William Yang (@WilliamYang120) December 2, 2024 Moscow Making Moves? Russia’s Central Bank has long advocated a crypto ban. It also plans to launch its digital ruble nationwide sometime in 2025. However, a total ban now looks unlikely. President Vladimir Putin has signed several crypto-specific laws this year, legalizing the use of crypto in cross-border trade and granting the crypto mining sector legal status . “Russia has the most tangible incentive to move away from trading in the US dollar. Despite the fact that China is also a geopolitical adversary of the United States, it is also the largest foreign holder of US government debt (holding almost 20%). Thus, at least in the short term, it is not profitable for China to destroy the American currency. Nevertheless, alternative mechanisms must be created. And [BRICS nations] are currently working on these.” Ivanov The post Russian Expert: How BRICS Could Affect Global Crypto Markets appeared first on Cryptonews .",NEUTRAL,BTC | USDT,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | USDT,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-expert-how-brics-payment-plans-could-affect-the-global-crypto-market/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37164411.jpeg

37158850,https://coinpedia.org/?p=388214,1733194443,A New Altcoin on The Horizon: Potential To Eclipse DOGE and BONK!,"The post A New Altcoin on The Horizon: Potential To Eclipse DOGE and BONK! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News There’s a real buzz in the crypto markets right now, despite the traditional Thanksgiving holiday slowdown – if anything, interest is intensifying as we approach the end of the year. While altcoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) are garnering attention with analysts indicating that prices may rise, there’s another coin entering the fray. 1FUEL’s one-click cross-chain transactions and blistering presale price projections could see it eclipse its rivals in commanding fashion. Simple, secure and user-friendly, 1FUEL’s revolutionary privacy-focused cryptocurrency could well go scorched earth on DOGE and BONK and leave both firmly in the shadows. Will DOGE fade in the face of uncertainty? While DOGE prices have risen in 2024 and did spike 150% in the aftermath of the U.S. election (helped along the way by public support from the self-titled ‘Dogefather’ Elon Musk) the memecoin has struggled to sustain its upward trajectory at times. It’s fair to say that DOGE ’ s ability to rally is still up for debate. Newer altcoins are striving to truly innovate and bring value to the space, while DOGE is heavily reliant on the influence of the controversial Tesla / X boss and now political advisor. Bonk prices remain highly unstable Like DOGE , BONK has struggled to remain consistent, with price rallies followed by dips. Achieving mass adoption and creating sustained, widespread market demand remains elusive, meaning BONK’s gains are likely to be very slow. Despite hype that it could hit $1, DigitalCoinPrice, Wallet Investor, Coincodex and Changeally are all in agreement that it won’t happen anytime soon and a huge leap in value remains very unlikely. 1FUEL has the potential to overshadow both DOGE and BONK 1FUEL is the new privacy-focused cryptocurrency on the block and is already garnering significant attention. Unlike DOGE and BONK which have thus far relied on meme hype and celebrity endorsement to create a buzz, 1FUEL has much more solid underpinnings which set it up for longer term success. Instead of relying on the cult of hype like BONK and DOGE, 1FUEL brings some credentials and innovations to the table. It couples unparalleled automation, with ease of use and robust security measures. It effortlessly handles cross-chain and peer-to-peer transactions with a game changing hassle-free trading style. 1FUEL also works in the background to identify the best exchange rate and minimize fees for users. No other wallet gives users the same degree of freedom and simplicity – but it hasn’t overlooked the importance of privacy and security either. Its privacy mixer, independently verified smart contracts, multi-layered security architecture, disposable wallets and data minimization policy keep assets secure while also safeguarding user privacy. Presale predictions confirm 1FUEL as the next breakout altcoin 1FUEL is focused heavily on making a strong case for user adoption with notably higher levels of utility than both DOGE and BONK. As a result, its presale predictions are staggering, with experts seeing massive growth potential and returns of at least 500%. Those expectations only grow after the presale period with analysts additionally forecasting that 1FUEL will surge by as much as 100x after its public launch. This, coupled with its commitment to removing the technical barriers to trading, mean that it is in line for wider levels of adoption, demand and support than its rivals, setting the stage for it to eclipse DOGE and BONK as the new altcoin on the market. Join the presale The 1FUEL presale is happening right now with early investors set to benefit from crypto staking rewards of 30% APR.

Coinbase, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, recently announced plans to delist stablecoins that do not comply with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) by December 30, 2024. This move is part of Coinbase’s commitment to adhere to evolving regulatory standards within the European Economic Area (EEA). The Impact of MiCA Regulations on Stablecoins MiCA, which came into effect on June 30, introduces stringent oversight of cryptocurrency companies operating within the EU. One of its key requirements is that all stablecoins available in the EEA must have an e-money license in at least one EU member state. This regulation directly impacts stablecoins like Tether’s USDT, which may face delisting from platforms like Coinbase unless they secure the necessary authorization. Tether has acknowledged the challenges posed by MiCA and is reportedly working on a technology-based solution tailored for the European market. However, until such solutions are implemented, investors may find limited options for trading and investing with USDT on certain platforms. Nordic Arbex: A Reliable Haven for USDT Investors Amid these regulatory shifts, Nordic Arbex remains a steadfast platform for investors looking to capitalize on USDT investments. Unlike some exchanges moving away from USDT, Nordic Arbex continues to support the stablecoin, offering investors up to 4% weekly returns on their USDT holdings. Why Choose Nordic Arbex?

By enforcing stricter disclosure requirements, regular audits of crypto firms, and more robust capital reserve mandates, the EU aims to build trust and transparency across the marketplace. While some platforms may face challenges during this transition, others like Nordic Arbex are poised to thrive by aligning with regulatory requirements while still delivering value to their users. Conclusion The impending delisting of USDT by major exchanges such as Coinbase underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market and the critical importance of regulatory compliance. For investors seeking stability and high returns on their USDT investments, Nordic Arbex offers a compelling solution.

Trump Loves Russia (TRUMPRUS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRUS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Russia can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Russia could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Russia launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Russia on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Russia by entering its contract address – Qq41T28zPi8Wg7KWjeYMKkQPnUZ68ULvgWTEFpkaJXJ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRUS.

Liquidity Gamechanger on the Horizon?,"The GalaChain ecosystem has become notorious for innovative teams taking Web3 to new levels from what’s commonly known. Recent discussions show the people-powered AI solution is a major player in a planned move that could drive significant liquidity to and fro GalaChain and other significant players in Web3. If achieved, the bridge will further strengthen its standing as the most innovative in the ecosystem. In a recent tweet, the disclosure was made about a bridge between GalaChain and the TON ecosystem. According to the tweet, the decided bridge is part of a broader strategy to develop core technologies to support $TON. Interestingly, this is not just about TON and GalaChain. This move could see liquidity flow between high-potential ecosystems in Web3—something you don’t see often in the blockchain ecosystem. No surprises, as this has been the kind of innovative moves GalaChain has become synonymous with. A Bridge of Opportunity Blockchain bridges are not new. They are becoming increasingly critical as interoperability becomes the holy grail of decentralized finance. A possible GalaChain-TON bridge holds the potential to unlock vast amounts of liquidity. GalaChain has become popular for innovation within the Web3 ecosystem. It is a Layer 1 Blockchain developed by Gala, that serves as a core for its web3 entertainment ecosystem that includes games, music and film. With a strong community of thinker’s and builders driving the vision of blockchain technology, it has seen major dynamic Layer 1 solutions built in rapid fashion. Boasting a flexibility not seen on other chains, the actual design of GalaChain is to bring the next billion users on-chain. On the other hand TON has built a reputation as a powerhouse blockchain with a focus on speed and efficiency. The blockchain is also known for its scalability and growing adoption. Together, these two chains could create a liquidity superhighway, offering seamless asset transfer, reduced barriers to entry, and a more integrated user experience. The bridge’s impact on liquidity and trading volume will reflect the strength of both ecosystems. Liquidity providers and marketing participants could see significant benefits, with increased cross-chain activity and the possibility of new trading pairs enhancing market dynamics. Additionally, as decentralized finance continues to expand, the bridge could introduce new opportunities for yield farming, staking, and other financial instruments. This will further drive liquidity and utility for both chains. Stronger Implications for Other Stakeholders The tweet emphasized an effect that doesn’t just involve $GALA and $TON, but a significant innovation that will have a ripple effect on multiple blockchain protocols. According to the tweet, TON has already built a bridge that allows users to transfer assets between TON Blockchain and the Ethereum Blockchain, as well as between TON and the BNB Smart Chain. A GalaChain-TON bridge will enable massive liquidity flow to TON that would trickle down to other ecosystems linked to TON. Notably, GalaChain also has an ETH bridge , signalling how big players in the ecosystem are quick to collaborate with the chain. The GalaChain Ethereum bridge is a crucial component of the Gala Games ecosystem, enabling seamless transfer of GALA tokens between the Ethereum network and GalaChain. The bridge facilitates the transfer of GALA tokens in both directions: from Ethereum to GalaChain and vice versa. For users in the United States, the Galachain X Ton bridge could be a lifeline. $TON is difficult to acquire due to regional restrictions, but the bridge with GalaChain would provide an alternative. US-based users could potentially access TON’s ecosystem without the usual hurdles, enhancing both usability and adoption. A GalaChain-TON bridge could set new standards for how blockchains collaborate. Of course, all bridges come with obvious challenges. Security, scalability, and user adoption are all critical factors that will determine the success of any cross-chain initiatives. Despite the aforementioned concerns, the individual strength of both chains can navigate these hurdles and present immense rewards. The latest communication however, sends a wave of optimism for both ecosystems, especially those interested in seeing this collaboration drive more cutting edge innovations. There is a clear anticipation that underlines the need for more accessible, efficient, and interconnected systems.",POSITIVE,ETH | TON | GALA,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRADING | TON | GALA,,0,0,Bitcoin World,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/galachain-x-ton-bridge-liquidity-gamechanger-on-the-horizon/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png

Bitcoin ($BTC ), meanwhile, appears to be taking a breather, hovering near $95K after its breakout run from the $73K range. Source: coinmarketcap.com Historically, December following U.S. presidential elections is known for bullish tendencies, but this year brings mixed signals. While the Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates steady at 4.25%-4.5% ( link ), the dollar's strength poses a headwind for risk assets. At the same time, a full-force altcoin rally suggests traders are rotating capital, betting on high-risk assets during a speculative frenzy. As traders, whether short- or long-term, our mission is clear: stay prepared, plan our entries, and avoid chasing the first dip without a solid strategy (because let’s face it, the first dip can be a trick). In this analysis, we'll explore three likely correction scenarios for Bitcoin, identify actionable buy-the-dip levels, and highlight the technical reasoning and risks for each. Scenario 1: The Sideways Range Between $91K-$100K Key Technicals: Bitcoin's recent price action suggests the potential formation of a new range between $91K and $100K. The weekly candle’s inside-bar structure between $91000 & $98000 signals indecision, aligning with typical range-bound behavior (inside bars occur when the high and low of a candle are ""inside"" the range of the previous candle, often preceding continuation or reversal moves). On the daily timeframe, $91K is a temporary horizontal support level, while $100K serves as psychological resistance. Strategy: Wait for Confirmation: Monitor Bitcoin’s behavior near the $91K-$92K zone for strong support confirmation via bounce volume or bullish engulfing candles. Buy-the-Dip Level: Between $91K-$92K, aiming for $98K-$100K on the rebound. Stop Loss: Below $89.5K to avoid deeper downside risks. Monitor: Volume spikes and RSI divergence on the 4H/1D charts to confirm ranging activity. Why This Matters: Ranging price action is a hallmark of consolidation phases, often preparing for the next big move. By waiting for confirmation of $91K as a reliable floor, traders can exploit price oscillations between $91K and $100K for swing opportunities. Scenario 2: The Deeper Correction to $81K-$83K Key Technicals: The liquidation heatmap highlights a significant cluster of long liquidations between $83K-$85K, which could act as a liquidity magnet if Bitcoin loses $91K support. There’s a fair value gap (FVG) between $81.3K and $89.5K visible on higher timeframes. FVGs represent imbalances in price action, often revisited before a trend resumes. The Fibonacci retracement tool aligns the Golden Ratio (0.618) with this zone, adding a layer of confluence. Strategy: Set Alerts for Breakdown: If Bitcoin closes a daily candle below $91K with rising sell volume, prepare for entries near $81K-$83K. Buy-the-Dip Level: Between $81K-$83K, targeting $91K on the bounce. Stop Loss: Below $80K to account for false breakdowns. Monitor: Price action around the Golden Ratio (0.618) and the lower bound of the FVG for bullish reversals. Why This Matters: This scenario assumes a market maker-driven move to flush out over-leveraged longs, creating a prime re-entry point. A 15%-18% correction from the current price would still be modest compared to past cycles, presenting a realistic and lucrative buy zone. Scenario 3: A Full Breakdown to $70K-$73K Key Technicals: The 200-day SMA ($67.3K) and the top of the February-November accumulation range ($73K) act as key dynamic and horizontal supports, respectively. Below $80K, the next liquidity cluster lies between $70K-$73K, marking the ultimate ""stink order"" zone for longer-term entries. Historical cycles suggest that Bitcoin rarely retraces this deeply during December, but if it does, the opportunity could be significant. Strategy: Stagger Stink Orders: Place staggered bids between $70K-$73K to catch potential wicks during panic-driven sell-offs. Target: $85K-$90K for partial exits, holding moonbags for potential continuation to $98K+. Stop Loss: Below $67K, the 200-day SMA, as a hard floor. Monitor: Broad market conditions, including DXY strength and altcoin liquidity flow, to gauge overall risk appetite. Why This Matters: Though less likely, this scenario prepares traders for worst-case corrections while capitalizing on extreme fear-driven moves. Long-term buyers could use this zone to accumulate Bitcoin at significant discounts. Wider Context and December Outlook Bitcoin’s current setup reflects a tug-of-war between bullish seasonality (December is traditionally a strong month for risk assets) and macroeconomic headwinds like the dollar's strength. With the Altcoin Season Index at 84, suggesting speculative enthusiasm, Bitcoin could stay range-bound while altcoins dominate short-term performance. The Federal Reserve's likely decision to hold interest rates steady in two weeks adds to this mix, reducing near-term monetary uncertainty. Yet, until Bitcoin firmly establishes a new range or confirms $100K as a breakout point, traders must remain cautious. Summary: Navigating December with a Plan In conclusion: Scenario 1 ($91K-$100K): Likely range action, tradeable for swing traders. Scenario 2 ($81K-$83K): Deeper correction, ideal for mid-term positions. Scenario 3 ($70K-$73K): The ultimate crash zone, best for long-term accumulation. With a strategic approach, December can be both profitable and exciting. Remember, it’s Santa season—a time for optimism—but also for discipline. Invest wisely, stick to your plan, and let the market come to you. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

37161116,https://invezz.com/?p=2335207,1733191320,Stellar Lumens price prediction: what next for the XLM token?,"Stellar Lumens (XLM) price rally has stalled recently as it took a breather following a near 500% short squeeze. The XLM token was trading at $0.5290 on Tuesday morning, a few points below the year-to-date high of $0.6370. It has surged by 630% from its lowest point this year. Why did Stellar Lumens price short squeeze? Stellar and Ripple are often grouped together in the crypto industry since they were all formed to disrupt the payments industry. Ripple’s goal was to have companies like banks and money transfer firms embrace its RippleNet technology. In this, these firms would use its infrastructure, including the XRP token to facilitate trade. Stellar, on the other hand, created technology that can be used by these firms to power their payment networks. Its most important partnership has been with Circle, the creator of USD Coin, the second-biggest stablecoin in the industry. It has also inked a deal with MoneyGram, a leading player in the payment industry. That partnership ensures that users can send and receive USDC in thousands of locations globally. This is a big partnership that will drive growth over time because it is at the intersection of blockchain and fiat. The Stellar Lumens price has also had a short squeeze because of the rising amount of money in its blockchain . Data shows that the network’s total value locked (TVL) has jumped to over $60 million . A $60 million TVL is much lower than that found in other newer chains like Sui and Base. However, it is worth noting that Stellar’s layer-1 network known as Soroban was launched a few months ago. The biggest players in Stellar’s network are players like LumenSwap, Blend, Aquarius Stellar, and FxDAO. Notably, Stellar has become a big name in the Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization industry. Its biggest partnership has been with Franklin Templeton, a large asset manager with over $1.5 trillion in assets. Franklin now uses Stellar’s blockchain to power the Franklin OnChain US Government Money Fund (FOBXX) which has attracted over $400 million in assets. There are signs that assets in this money market fund are increasing even with US interest rates falling. Stellar Lumens has also soared as hopes that institutional investors will buy it soon jumped. Canary, a top financial services company, has already filed for a spot Stellar ETF. Meanwhile, the recent Donald Trump victory has made Stellar and Ripple more attractive to investors. That’s primarily because Ripple has gone through a rough patch with the SEC in the past few years. XLM price forecast Stellar price chart | source: TradingView The weekly chart shows that the XLM token bottomed at $0.0760, where it formed a double-bottom pattern. It has moved above the key resistance point at $0.1945, its highest swing in July 2023. That was an important level since it happened after Ripple won a major lawsuit against the SEC. Stellar Lumens price has now jumped to the strong pivot reverse point at $0.5860. It has also rallied to the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level. Also, the Stellar price has moved above the 50-week and 100-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Also, the coin is showing signs of forming a bullish pennant pattern. This pattern is made up of a long vertical line and a triangle pattern. Stellar’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD indicators have pointed upward. Therefore, there is a likelihood that the Stellar lumens will have a strong bullish breakout in the coming days. If this happens, the next point to watch will be at $0.9765, the extreme overshoot point. This price is about 85% above the current level. On the flip side, a drop below the key support at $0.4400, its highest point in November 2021 will point to more downside.

37157457,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656286,1733191214,"Strong Bitcoin Rise “Expected Within 1-2 Months,” Quant Explains Why","A quant has explained how Bitcoin may be expected to see a strong rise in the coming months based on a golden cross that has occurred in this indicator. Bitcoin SOPR Has Just Witnessed A Bullish Crossover As an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post pointed out , the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) has shown a golden crossover recently. The “ SOPR ” here refers to an indicator that tells us whether the BTC investors are selling their coins at a profit or loss. This metric works by going through the transaction history of each coin being sold/transferred to see what price it was moved at last time. If this price is less than the current spot price for any token, its sale contributes to profit realization. Similarly, transactions involving coins of the opposite type imply loss realization is occurring. The SOPR sums up these profits and losses for the entire sell supply, and determines their ratio. When the value of this indicator is greater than 1, it means the average holder could be assumed to be selling their coins at a net profit. On the other hand, being under the mark implies that the overall market is realizing more losses than profits. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day and 365-day moving averages (MAs) of the Bitcoin SOPR over the past decade: As is visible in the above graph, the 30-day MA of the Bitcoin SOPR fell under the 365-day earlier in the year, but recently, it has reversed its direction and has broken past the level. This increase naturally corresponds to the return of notable profit-taking in the sector following the latest rally of the cryptocurrency. In the chart, the quant highlighted the previous instances of this crossover. It would appear that each of these led into bullish price action for the asset. “After the golden cross appears, the market usually starts a strong rise within 2 months at the latest,” notes the analyst. Thus, it’s possible that Bitcoin could be gearing up for another run shortly. This latest bullish crossover in the Bitcoin SOPR is the second time this cycle that the pattern has appeared, so it’s possible that the run now would lead the asset to its final peak of the cycle. It remains to be seen, though, whether the crossover between the monthly and yearly averages of the indicator would prove to be bullish for BTC or not.

Qubetics Reaches the 11th Stage of Presale While Solana and Cardano Race Ahead,"The crypto world is buzzing with action as Solana continues to shine with its lightning-fast ecosystem updates, and Cardano’s steady climb draws in cautious investors. Both projects are making headlines, each vying for dominance in a fiercely competitive market. But while these giants race forward, another name is quietly reshaping the narrative with its own groundbreaking innovations—Qubetics. Qubetics is shaking things up as it enters the 11th stage of its presale. With over $4.1 million raised and analysts forecasting $10–$15 for $TICS post-mainnet, it’s hard not to feel the FOMO. Beyond the numbers, Qubetics isn’t just another presale hype train; it’s offering a real solution to blockchain’s long-standing usability and scalability issues with its cutting-edge QubeQode IDE. In a sea of coins, Qubetics might just be the game-changer you’ve been waiting for. Qubetics: A Presale Turning Heads Qubetics is officially in the 11th stage of its presale, and things are getting spicy. With over 259 million $TICS tokens sold, raising a jaw-dropping $4.1 million, investors are buzzing with excitement. And why wouldn’t they be? Analysts are throwing around predictions of $10 to $15 for $TICS after its mainnet launch, which could mean life-changing returns for early adopters. Just imagine turning an $85,000 investment into millions—are you in yet? Beyond the numbers, Qubetics isn’t just another coin on the block. It’s bringing something truly game-changing to the table: QubeQode IDE . This revolutionary toolkit aims to smooth over blockchain’s rough edges, finally making decentralised applications user-friendly and scalable. Ever struggled with clunky, unintuitive blockchain apps? QubeQode IDE is the answer, promising streamlined user experiences and robust transaction processing. With scalability and usability finally sorted, this could be a turning point for blockchain tech. Solana: Still the Speed King Solana’s making moves, and not just in its lightning-fast transaction speeds. The blockchain has been buzzing with ecosystem developments, keeping its community pumped. Did you catch the latest news about Solana’s dominance in NFT trading? It’s no wonder the coin remains a favourite for developers who value performance above all else. But here’s the catch: Solana isn’t immune to blockchain’s big dilemmas. Outages and centralisation concerns keep popping up in conversations. Still, its unmatched throughput continues to solidify its position as a leader in the space. If you’re a fan of efficiency, Solana’s showing no signs of slowing down. Cardano: Slow and Steady Wins the Race? Cardano’s price has been a rollercoaster, with recent rallies turning heads. Yet, even amid cooling markets, this blockchain giant is proving its staying power. Analysts are divided on whether ADA can sustain its growth, but let’s not ignore its solid fundamentals. With a strong focus on research and development, Cardano is often seen as the “academic blockchain” that plays the long game. Despite its reputation for taking things slow, Cardano’s scalability solutions and environmentally conscious approach give it an edge in this crowded market. Investors are watching closely, waiting to see if ADA’s cautious climb can outpace its flashier competitors like Solana and Qubetics. Conclusion Qubetics , Solana, and Cardano are rewriting the rules of crypto investing. Whether you’re in it for speed, sustainability, or revolutionary tools like QubeQode IDE, one thing’s for sure—there’s never been a better time to dive in. So, which one’s grabbing your cash?

37157386,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51198,1733190307,Top 5 Coins to Buy Today for Massive Returns,"Cryptocurrency isn’t just a buzzword anymore—it’s the future of finance. With countless projects vying for your attention, it’s tough to pick the winners. But don’t worry, we’ve done the homework for you. Here’s a list of the top 5 coins to buy today, with one clear frontrunner leading the pack. Spoiler: it’s not Bitcoin or Ethereum. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Decentralised Privacy If you’re searching for innovation, stop right here. Qubetics isn’t just another crypto; it’s an ecosystem. Its decentralised VPN (dVPN) is solving one of the biggest issues today: digital privacy. Traditional VPNs? Outdated, centralised, and prone to breaches. Qubetics flips the script with decentralised, secure, and scalable solutions. But it doesn’t stop there. Qubetics is also a Web3 aggregator, providing access to decentralised applications (dApps) across multiple chains. Analysts are hyped. With a presale price of $0.0282, projections estimate $TICS hitting $15 after the mainnet launch. That’s a mind-blowing 52,912% ROI. Think about it. An investment of $1,000 today could become $530,000. Still waiting? Every second counts as the presale journey takes the top flight. 2. Cardano ($ADA): The Sustainable Blockchain Pioneer Cardano has long been hailed as the “Ethereum killer.” Why? Because it focuses on scalability, sustainability, and energy efficiency. Built on peer-reviewed research, Cardano is constantly upgrading its ecosystem. Its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism is not only eco-friendly but also incredibly secure. Cardano’s upcoming Hydra upgrade aims to process over a million transactions per second. That’s a massive leap forward in blockchain scalability. While its price movements have been steady, analysts predict substantial growth as adoption increases. If you’re into long-term stability with room for explosive growth, $ADA is a solid bet. 3. Solana ($SOL): The Speed Demon Solana is the Ferrari of blockchains—fast, flashy, and always stealing the spotlight. With transaction speeds reaching 65,000 per second, Solana leaves competitors in the dust. It’s already a favourite for NFT platforms and decentralised finance (DeFi) applications. But speed isn’t Solana’s only strength. Its low fees and growing ecosystem are attracting developers and investors alike. While some argue its centralisation is a drawback, others see it as a feature for scalability. With $SOL’s price currently undervalued, now might be the perfect time to grab some before the next bull run. 4. Avalanche ($AVAX): The Multiverse of Blockchains Avalanche is redefining how blockchains interact. Its subnet architecture allows for custom, scalable chains that still connect to the main Avalanche network. Think of it as a multiverse where every blockchain has its own rules but can still communicate seamlessly. This flexibility makes Avalanche a favourite for institutions and enterprises. Its ecosystem is booming, with projects ranging from DeFi platforms to NFT marketplaces. Analysts predict strong upward momentum for $AVAX, especially as its partnerships grow. Avalanche might not promise the astronomical gains of Qubetics, but it’s a solid pick for those who want a balance of innovation and reliability. 5. Polygon ($MATIC): Ethereum’s Best Friend Ethereum may be the king, but even kings need allies. Polygon acts as a scaling solution for Ethereum, reducing congestion and lowering transaction fees. Its Layer-2 network has become the go-to choice for developers who want Ethereum’s security without the high gas fees. With high-profile collaborations, including partnerships with Disney and Reddit, Polygon is proving its value in the real world. Its upcoming zkEVM upgrade promises even faster transactions and greater scalability. Analysts believe $MATIC could see a significant price increase as Ethereum’s dominance continues. The Final Word Every crypto investor has a “what if” story. What if I’d bought Bitcoin at $100? What if I’d gotten in on Ethereum’s ICO? Here’s your chance to avoid another regret. Qubetics is the real deal, and its presale is your golden ticket. The best cryptos to buy now don’t wait for anyone. Get in on Qubetics before the next stage hits, and secure your slice of the future. The clock’s ticking.

Santa Pepe (SANPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Pepe by entering its contract address – 2NefXDdBhUkVn7dXW5wxVtCHKHKE8uiRGUqZGxT5HAN8 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/santa-pepe-sanpepe-solana-memecoin-to-explode-19000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

BTFD Is Fast to Run Towards the Finish Line While Gigachad and Ponke Give Tough Competition,"Crypto is more than just numbers—it’s a vibe, and meme coins are stealing the show. Whether it’s Elon Musk’s tweets or the rise of meme culture, coins like Gigachad, Ponke, and BTFD Coin are adding flair to investing. They’ve gone from being jokes to genuine opportunities for some serious gains. Among these, BTFD Coin is rewriting the meme coin rulebook. From its viral presale to its jaw-dropping numbers, this token is rallying the community like no other. Wondering if it’s one of the best meme coins to join this week? Let’s dive in and break it down! BTFD Coin: The Underdog That’s Leading the Pack If you’re looking for meme coin royalty in the making, BTFD Coin is your ticket. Since its presale launched on November 26, 2024, it has smashed expectations, raising over $500,000 in just one week. With a current price of $0.000058 in Stage 6, early investors are already dreaming of moonshots. The kicker? The 16-stage presale is designed to reward early adopters, giving them an edge before its price skyrockets post-launch. Analysts are bullish, predicting a potential listing price of $0.0006, which could multiply your returns. Imagine this: Investing $4,000 in Stage 6 at $0.000058. That’s a whopping 68.9 million BTFD Coins in your wallet. When it hits $0.0006, your investment could balloon to over $41,000. Now that’s meme coin magic. But BTFD isn’t just about numbers. It’s community-driven with perks like staking rewards and a play-to-earn (P2E) game. The devs are focused on sustainability, so it’s not just another pump-and-dump. In the wild world of crypto, this coin’s roadmap stands out. Gigachad: Flexing Its Meme Muscles What’s more alpha than a Chad? A Gigachad. This coin has all the swagger of its internet namesake, but can it keep the hype alive? Launched with a meme-heavy marketing campaign, Gigachad gained traction quickly, especially among Gen Z investors. Its tagline? “Be the Chad, own the coin.” The beauty of Gigachad lies in its simplicity. The project focuses on community and decentralisation. With minimal utility but maximum meme appeal, it’s a crowd favourite for short-term gains. However, experts warn about its volatility. You’ve got to be ready to “buy the dip” (pun intended) to ride the waves. For investors who love fast-paced action, Gigachad is like riding a rollercoaster. Just don’t forget: It’s risky business. This meme coin thrives on trends, so if the hype fizzles, so might the profits. Ponke: The Wholesome Meme Coin Who knew a frog could be so relatable? Enter Ponke, a coin inspired by its charmingly innocent frog mascot. While its cuteness might seem like a gimmick, Ponke is carving out a niche in eco-friendly initiatives. Yep, this meme coin has a green side. Ponke’s creators have partnered with environmental groups, turning their coin into a movement. Every transaction contributes to reforestation projects, giving it a feel-good factor that’s rare in the meme coin space. Add in low transaction fees and an enthusiastic community, and you’ve got a contender with real staying power. But don’t mistake Ponke for a purely feel-good coin. Its market cap has been climbing steadily, and its user base is growing across the globe. The eco-friendly angle could make it a favourite among investors who value purpose over just profits. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, the meme coin space is buzzing with opportunities. From Gigachad’s unapologetic boldness to Ponke’s eco-conscious heart, there’s no shortage of excitement. But one coin is leading the charge: BTFD Coin . Don’t miss your chance to join the presale while it’s still in Stage 6. With its impressive performance and strong community backing, BTFD Coin is more than just a meme—it’s a movement. Join the presale today and ride the wave to crypto glory.

Pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital tells his 517,800 followers on the social media platform X that a bullish Ethereum ( ETH ) would be very favorable for the altcoin market. “An ETH breakout would lead the next wave of altcoin rallies.” Looking at Ethereum, the trader says ETH is very close to sparking a high timeframe breakout. “Ethereum is now pressing past the ~$3,700 resistance of its main pattern (light blue). A weekly close above the pattern top would kickstart a breakout and end the 2024 ETH downtrend.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Ethereum has closed the latest weekly candle above $3,700. At time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $3,731. Late last month, Rekt said that Ethereum moving above $3,100 would trigger capital rotation from Bitcoin to ETH. He also shared a chart suggesting that capital would eventually move from ETH to mid-cap and subsequently lower-cap coins. “A weekly close above the blue diagonal resistance ($3,100) would likely set up another wave in the money flow cycle as ETH would take control of large-cap money flow.” Source: Rekt Capital/X As for Bitcoin, Rekt says the crypto king needs to rally above its immediate resistance to spark an upside burst toward the six-figure level. “Bitcoin is now trying to press beyond the bull flag top. A daily close above the bull flag resistance of ~$97,450 could kickstart additional trend continuation to get closer to challenging $100,000 once again.” Source: Rekt Capital/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $97,891.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. DTX Exchange, a smart new technology, is set to outpace Shiba Inu by leveraging its blockchain and massive growth potential. Table of Contents DTX Exchange: Driving adoption for $9m crypto presale Shiba Inu’s challenges: The road ahead Why now is the time to invest in DTX Exchange The future is hybrid As we are entering 2025 the altcoin market is starting to heat up. Drawing the attention of many investors is DTX Exchange (DTX), making headlines for its $9 million presale. As early backers have gained 400% already, many analysts are placing DTX Exchange ahead of Shina Inu (SHIB) as the most underrated altcoin ahead of 2025. DTX Exchange: Driving adoption for $9m crypto presale As traders set the trend away from speculative assets to coins with real-world applications, this creates opportunities for DTX Exchange to shine. While Shiba Inu continues to depend on community hype to run, DTX is building itself as a trustworthy and forward-looking platform. DTX Exchange is leading the first hybrid approach at addressing these critical challenges of trading including financial exclusion, inaccessibility to diverse markets, and lack of a holistic set of tools. DTX has a combined ecosystem of traditional and decentralized trading instruments that will appeal to both seasoned traders and crypto newcomers. Due to their growing reputation, DTX Exchange has had one of the most successful presales this year. DTX is a hot item amongst investors, with over $9,000,000 raised during early funding rounds. With DTX tokens trading for an attractive $0.10, early investors saw a 400% increase in their initial investment. DTX Exchange is making headlines for a limited-time offer, where investors who use the promo code SELLSTAGE get their deposit doubled. Shiba Inu’s challenges: The road ahead The recent rise of Shiba Inu as a top 15 cryptocurrency came through the support of the viral community and speculative trading. Although hype plays a role in the crypto world, a maturing market is evaluating assets such as SHIB on their input. Even after the expansion of SHIB’s ecosystem into projects such as Shibarium, ShibaSwap, and Shib.io, more was needed for Shiba Inu to reach its previous peaks. As one of the weakest performers this cycle, SHIB’s price only increased by 40%. When compared to similar altcoins who experienced 100% growth, Shiba Inu has a lot of ground to reclaim. You might also like: Analyst confident of a SHIB surge to $0.0002 as DTX is set to give the meme coin a run Why now is the time to invest in DTX Exchange Now that we’ve entered a new phase of growth with the crypto market, timing matters. The sooner investors see the potential of hybrid platforms like DTX Exchange, the better off they will be. Some of the main reasons why DTX is one of the most underrated altcoins are: High growth potential: An analyst is predicting up to 5,000% gains post-launch for DTX, calling it the most lucrative investment in the current market. Comprehensive ecosystem: DTX bridges the gap between TradFi and DeFi by addressing critical market gaps and providing mass adoption. Affordable entry point: Retail and institutional investors alike can see substantial upside potential with DTX at $0.1 per token during presale. The future is hybrid The crypto bull market is just the beginning for DTX Exchange, which sets the standard for trading that goes well beyond the bulls of the cryptocurrency market. DTX Exchange is the obvious choice for investors who want to add a token that brings the elements of innovation, accessibility, and growth potential to their portfolio.

37155288,https://crypto.news/?p=14315597,1733186318,Here’s why stablecoin withdraws to self-custody wallet may ban in Brazil,"Banco Central do Brazil (BCB), the largest central bank in South America, has proposed legislation to ban stablecoin withdrawals to self-custody wallets. According to the Federal Government of Brazil’s document on Dec. 02, the central bank has opened the public consultation about the proposed idea of banning stablecoin withdraws to self-custody wallets. The central bank aims to amend several digital asset laws, including BCB Resolution No. 277 of 2022, which regulates the virtual asset service provider in the foreign exchange market. The growing trading volume and connections between digital assets and conventional financial instruments have led the government to regulate these withdrawals. “The topic has been widely discussed in international forums, which recommend the adoption of regulations and supervision compatible with the functionalities provided and the risks associated with such assets,” the proposal state. Another concern raised by the regulators is interconnected with traditional models, consumer and investor protections, prevention of illicit data purposes, and financial-macroeconomic stability. This proposal, with a due date of Feb. 02, 2025, would determine the regulatory body in which the activities of stablecoin would be included under the foreign exchange market or subject to Brazilian capital abroad and foreign capital in the country.

37155092,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656334,1733185814,Bitcoin to Enter Final Bull Phase? Key Indicator Hints at Major Price Movement,"Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency, appears to be on the brink of a potential sharp rise. According to a CryptoQuant analyst, Crypto Dan, the market could experience a significant upward trend within the next two months. This insight , shared on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, is based on a critical market indicator that has historically signaled major price rallies. Bitcoin Market Outlook: Sharp Rise Incoming In the post titled “Strong Rise in Bitcoin is Expected Within 1-2 Months”, Crypto Dan highlights the emergence of a “golden cross” in the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) indicator. This occurrence, he notes, is a rare event that typically happens only once or twice during an entire bull market cycle. As part of the current bullish cycle that began in January 2023, its reappearance is being seen as a strong precursor to a substantial market move . For further context, the SOPR Ratio indicator measures realized profits and losses in the Bitcoin market, offering insight into investor sentiment. The “golden cross” identified by Crypto Dan signifies a pivotal moment in the bull cycle . Historically, this signal has been followed by strong price increases within two months of its appearance. Crypto Dan explained that the market is likely entering the final phase of the current upward cycle, a stage characterized by steeper price gains and shorter periods of consolidation . This means that while Bitcoin’s ascent might accelerate, the opportunities for investors to accumulate at lower prices could diminish rapidly. Furthermore, he projected that if the anticipated rise materializes by the end of 2024 or the first quarter of 2025, it could draw significant new capital into the market. The inflow of additional funds is expected to fuel Bitcoin’s momentum, potentially driving the market to its peak during this cycle. Dan wrote: As the market moves towards the later stages of the cycle, the magnitude of the rise tends to be larger, and the periods of decline/adjustment are shorter. If a steep rise occurs as implied by this indicator within the end of 2024 to the first quarter of 2025, it can be expected that new inflows and additional funds will enter the market, bringing it to its peak. BTC Market Performance Meanwhile, Bitcoin continues to maintain stability above the $95,000 price mark. At the time of writing, the asset currently trades for $96,296, down by 1% in the past day but still up by nearly 40% in the past month. According to a renowned crypto analyst known as Ali on X, while some in the community expect a major retracement in Bitcoin’s price, BTC could do the opposite. The analyst projected BTC could surge to as high as $120,000-$150,000 before the first 30% price correction . Given the fact that #Bitcoin tends to do the opposite of what the crowd believes, there is potential for $BTC to go higher. If the current cycle behaves like the last two, #BTC could go to $120,000-$150,000 before the first 30% price correction. https://t.co/xTHJMITqJa — Ali (@ali_charts) December 2, 2024 Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-to-enter-final-bull-phase-key-indicator-hints-at-major-price-movement/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/37155092.jpeg

The fresh round of funds will be used to expand Union’s core team, advance partner integrations, and contribute to ecosystem growth. The fundraising comes after Union raised $4 million in seed financing last year. Borderless Capital participated in the new round, along with angels from the Polygon, Celestia, Movement, and Berachain communities, Union Labs said Tuesday.  Union’s core product is a modular, zero-knowledge (ZK) interoperability layer, designed to ease movement of assets between the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems. Its mainnet is supposed to go live in early 2025.  In April, Union Labs said it would be integrating with Polygon’s AggLayer, signaling a deepening of links between Polygon, one of the more well-known Ethereum scaling solutions, and Cosmos’ Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC).  Union is also interested in building in the Bitcoin ecosystem, “addressing the chain’s scripting limitations to enable secure asset transfers across Bitcoin L2s and the multichain ecosystem, enhancing DeFi on Bitcoin,” the team said in a press release.

However, despite the closure, the brand’s Ethereum tokens will remain accessible to the public. RFTKT will launch an updated website to maintain its legacy On Monday, Nike’s digital fashion brand, RTFKT, disclosed that it will cease operations by the end of January 2025. In an X post, the platform commented: Today, we’re announcing the plan to wind down RTFKT operations. Looking back, we’re incredibly proud of everything we’ve achieved together. ~ RTFKT The platform reflected on its past achievements, including the Clone X project with Takashi Murakami, the development of the first digital sneakers, and the number of artists and creators it has inspired. Additionally, it hopes to maintain this legacy by releasing an updated website that showcases its many works and designs. The brand also believes its innovative ethos will “live on through” the many creators and artists it motivated, adding that it has not come to an end but materialized into what it was always meant to be —an artifact of cultural evolution. Moreover, RTFKT still plans to launch one more ingenuity before its closure- the MNLTH X featuring the BLADE DROP. While the launch may break new technical ground, some analysts believe it could be perceived as a desperate revenue grab before closure. However, Nike is yet to confirm RTFKT‘s operation wind down. RTFKT and Nike have collaborated on shoe designs since 2021 Nike’s acquisition of RTFKT in 2021, under former CEO John Donahoe, came at a time when multiple companies wanted to pursue NFTs and the metaverse. Since then, the two have released incredible designer shoes, becoming a cult favorite for sports players. Even towards the end of 2023, streetwear designer Jeff Staple imagined a future where customers’ feet are scanned in-store for on-the-spot, zero-waste shoe production using recycled materials. During the Paris Olympics, Nike even unveiled a robot-powered, spray-on sneaker built using LightSpray technology that takes just three minutes to produce.

RCO Finance Positioned to Deliver 10,000x Gains from Its Lowest Point","Missed the boat on Cardano’s meteoric rise from $0.30? Don’t fret; there may be another chance to realize outsized gains. The emerging RCO Finance is poised to follow a similar trajectory, offering investors the potential for 10,000x returns from its lowest point. With its presale selling off fast, RCOF could be the next big thing in crypto. But what are the factors contributing to this bullish outlook? Find the details below! RCO Finance: AI-Powered Investing for the Next Cardano-like Surge As we look to the future, RCO Finance has the potential to mirror the impressive rally of Cardano, which began when it was trading at just $0.30. RCO Finance stands out for its profit potential and innovative offerings as a DeFi trading platform with unique features tailored for crypto traders. A key aspect of RCO Finance’s appeal is its emphasis on artificial intelligence, particularly in its robo-advisor service. Just think about having a financial advisor who recommends which digital assets to buy or not to buy, depending on your taste and level of risk tolerance. Unlike typical robo-advisors who make generic suggestions, RCO Finance’s AI tool analyzes current market trends and investor-specific data, making it relevant for seasoned traders and newcomers eager to enter the market. This personalized guidance can significantly enhance your trading experience. Additionally, RCO Finance is set to launch an exciting new debit card product, allowing users to access their digital assets practically. These debit cards represent ownership stakes and can be used within various DeFi projects on the platform. RCO Finance is meticulously designed to ensure users can trade confidently, and it is backed by a thorough audit of its smart contracts by SolidProof. This independent audit verifies that the platform operates safely and securely, giving investors peace of mind. ADA Price Eyes $2.45 On Fibonacci: A Second Chance To Win Big? Investors who missed Cardano’s price rally, which began at a modest price of $0.30 are being offered another chance as ADA aims to regain the $1.50 mark. Currently priced at $1, ADA has remained stable, not dropping below this threshold despite recent market fluctuations. Bitcoin, which significantly influences Cardano’s token price, is also experiencing volatility and has yet to reach the anticipated $100,000. Nevertheless, Cardano investors are optimistic, with some analysts predicting ADA could reach $2.45 based on the Fibonacci sequence. Investors are hopeful for ADA’s continued upward movement, especially with recent advancements like the launch of the first zero-knowledge (ZK) smart contract on Cardano. This development is expected to increase interest and demand for ADA, potentially leading to a price surge. RCOF Presale Stage 4: Buy Now at $0.077 Before It’s Too Late With RCO Finance having successfully raised over $7 million in its ongoing presale, this is your chance to seize a lucrative opportunity reminiscent of investing in Cardano at just $0.30. RCOF presale tokens are priced at only $0.0777 each in stage 4. This pricing strategy positions investors for an exciting future, with an anticipated launch price of $0.60, offering the potential for gains exceeding 600%. You can also enjoy a generous 50% discount on the current token price using the code RCOF50. Adding to the excitement, many experts are drawing parallels between RCOF and the historic Bitcoin price rally in 2021, owing to its deflationary model. This sentiment suggests that the token value could surge by an impressive 10000x. Don’t let this incredible opportunity pass you by—consider joining the RCOF presale today!
