42381895,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9q3In,1557618004,"ConsenSys CEO Predicts Trump Re-Election, Facebook Breakup and Crypto Revival","It was 2047, not 2019, in ConsenSys CEO Joseph Lubin's keynote address Saturday in Red Hook, Brooklyn.  To close out the 2019 Ethereal Summit in Brooklyn, he foresaw a future where assets had all been tokenized, the web was completely decentralized and networks organized around topical interests had become roughly as important to human life as nation states.  Notably, Lubin predicted President Donald Trump would win a second term in 2020.  He foresaw those following four years as marking a downturn in American civilization, marked by an increase in radical divisions and even hate crimes. The turnaround would only arrive, he predicted, when Facebook, ""finally admitting its role in global radicalism,"" broke itself into ""Facebook Media"" (the news feed) and ""Open Book,"" a decentralized social web that any startup could tap into.  In Lubin's vision, most of the progress since 2019 can be linked back one way or another to ConsenSys, despite a 2018 that ended with broad layoffs and challenges in spinning out incubated startups.  Lubin foresaw a medium-term future where, as he put it from his 2047 perch, ""Liberal democracy was on its death bed.""  Despite doubts about ethereum's potential to change how data is shared, he particularly foresaw a new era in more sustainable, more valuable journalism. ""Platforms like Civil triggered the recovery of the journalism industry, especially local journalism,"" Lubin said.  Civil  is a ConsenSys-supported project aiming to bring distributed verification and micropayments to the media industry.  He continued, ""Divorcing news delivery from the influence of advertising dollars was the breakthrough that drove the turnaround of western democracies.""  Lubin described a decentralized era in which ""ethics with respect to the truth, ethics with regard to the nature of facts"" took hold, as opposed to our backwards era, in which ""presenting balanced viewpoints and fostering critical thinking was anathema.""  By 2047 – with a decentralized open platform where former web giants had come to embrace a distributed ethos – ""We are all as a society able to engage in direct democratic decision-making,"" Lubin said.  ""The dream has been made real and we are all in it,"" the Lubin of 2047 said. He told the crowd:  ""These days we don't hear people talking about changing the world, just like we don't hear people talking about breathing or walking. It's just what we do.""

42381899,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9q3Np,1557608435,"$1 Million Bitcoin Scavenger Hunt Attracts 60,000 Digital Sleuths (And New Investors)","Nothing brings bitcoiners together like a quest peppered with cryptographic clues.  According to Satoshi’s Treasure co-creator Eric Meltzer of Primitive Ventures, so far nearly 60,000 people have signed up for notifications related to the international scavenger hunt for $1 million worth of bitcoin.  On Saturday, at the Magical Crypto Conference in New York, Melzter and the team revealed yet another clue: A series of cryptic images and other hints hidden on business cards distributed at the event.  And, as revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, a group of veteran crypto investors have pledged an undisclosed amount to fund future games and campaigns. These sponsors include Naval Ravikant, Balaji Srinivasan, Mark Pincus, Andrew Lee, IDEO CoLabs Ventures, Nic Carter, Matt Walsh, Meltem Demirors, Li Xiaolai, Jehan Chu and Sam Engelbardt.  ""I'd say Satoshi's Treasure is so exciting because it's the pure joy of a treasure hunt,"" Carter told CoinDesk. ""It's global and anyone can participate.""  Meanwhile, many have formed online teams to collect the 400 key fragments required to move the prize from the game’s bitcoin wallet, Meltzer said. Yet even the dynamics of these teams highlight how bitcoiners are unique compared to other online gaming communities. For example, software engineer John Cantrell cracked the code for one of the first key fragments then promptly detailed on both Twitter and GitHub how he managed to do it.  “For me, it’s really all about education,” Cantrell told CoinDesk.  Since then, Cantrell also joined several teams and created a free tool called Ordo to help teams organize clues and fairly credit contributions to the hunt, which will come in handy for any winning team looking to divvy up the loot.  Cantrell said so far the largest team using Ordo appears to have 600 members.  Another large team, called the Magellan Clan, told CoinDesk via email it has 100 members from 30 countries. It even made a unique token to reward people beyond the team who provide tips.  With so many players flocking to Satoshi’s Treasure, Cantrell isn’t the only one making tools and services for other players.  The 18-person ToshiCiphers clan, for example, has launched a merchandise store for teams looking to make shirts and other swag. ToshiCiphers clan member Devon Kramer told CoinDesk they’ve had four orders for custom shirts so far.  While many players in this game were, like Cantrell, already bitcoin veterans, some gamers have been attracted to Satoshi’s Treasure by the collaborative play, rather than the prize itself. Clues are spread both around the physical world and online, requiring a wide range of skills and languages for teams to be competitive.  “We have a couple of people who are new to cryptocurrency, didn’t know much about blockchain, but they were brought in by the hunt,” Kramer said.  Kramer’s teammate, who goes by Yann, added:  “I think we are playing the first Great game of the Augmented Reality Era.”  Satoshi's Treasure hunters image via Jess Wang",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/05/11/1-million-bitcoin-scavenger-hunt-attracts-60000-digital-sleuths-and-new-investors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/59a3b8e73027581c4d93bed60b517d397ec6b979-1280x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced at the Magical Crypto Conference on Saturday in New York City, Blockstream Satellite and goTenna are integrating their technologies to make it easier to send bitcoin transactions with technology used to onboard people without direct internet connections.  Blockstream Satellite is a network of satellites deployed so that people across most of the planet can download a bitcoin full node, the most secure portal to the bitcoin network, even without an internet connection. That is, as long as they have a satellite receiver with Blockstream Satellite's specific software installed.  goTenna is a startup exploring technology that allows users to connect with others without the internet -- to send text messages to others, for example. Instead, they have formed their own “mesh network” for sending messages. The limitation is that a user needs to connect to someone close-by, within a mile, to send a transaction.  As of late last year, the goTenna device also connects to their bitcoin wallet on an Android phone that users can put bitcoin in and then use to send bitcoin transactions without an internet connection - as long as they're able to connect to another goTenna user that has an internet connection.  goTenna explained in a statement:  “What this means for users is that they will be able to receive blockchain data via a satellite and send signed bitcoin transactions out via the goTenna Mesh network without a direct internet connection.""  ""The goTenna app is that it lets you send signed bitcoin transactions over our mesh network. If you're local provider is censoring you or your connection is down for some reason, maybe due to a natural disaster, you can still get it to the internet,"" said goTenna decentralized applications engineer Richard Myers in an interview with CoinDesk, adding that it also provides a more private way of sending bitcoin transactions.  This integration is part of a larger effort to make it easier for people to send offline transactions if they need to. It also makes Blockstream Satellite, which perhaps sounds more like a sci-fi project than a thing that will actually help people, a bit more useful.  ""The need for this technology might not be in New York City, but other parts of the world. It could be useful there instead of centralized internet providers,"" said Myers, adding that right now, users can send transactions with Blockstream Satellite using other technologies, such as high-frequency radio, but these technologies generally requires ""more specialized knowledge.""  This technology gives users one other option that Myers argues is easier. ""It lowers the bar for who can do this kind of wizardry,"" he said.

42381910,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9q3QL,1557601200,HTC Says Its Next Smartphone Will Run a Full Bitcoin Node,"Mobile phone manufacturer HTC wants to let its smartphone customers plug into the bitcoin blockchain.  Speaking on Saturday at the Magical Crypto Conference in New York, HTC's Phil Chen revealed a new low-cost version of its blockchain phone, the EXODUS 1s, announcing that the device will be capable of acting as a full node for the bitcoin network, meaning customers will store the entire blockchain’s data on their devices.  The company will also provide a software development kit (SDK) available for its Zion Vault, HTC’s crypto wallet app, and eventually plans to open-source the code behind its social key recovery mechanism.  Phil Chen, HTC’s decentralized chief officer, told CoinDesk that the company is targeting a release by the end of Q3.  “[The 1s is] going to be a lot cheaper, it will be a lot more accessible,” he said. The device will retail for between $250 and $300.  Specifications have not yet been released for the device.  The 1s will be based on the HTC EXODUS 1, which was announced at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2018 and released later in the year. While customers could initially only purchase the device with crypto, HTC opened up fiat payment options in February.  Full node  The most striking promise of the 1s will be its ability to run a full bitcoin node. Chen explained that the company saw that as ""a really important piece of the pie"" for the bitcoin ecosystem.  ""We think that’s foundational to the whole decentralized internet and just the whole fundamental premise,"" he said. ""If you don’t own your keys, you don’t own your bitcoin, you don’t own your crypto.”  The EXODUS 1 was designed to let users maintain their own private keys, which in turn formed the basis for this next move, Chen said.  He believes that from a technological standpoint, smartphones today are physically capable of handling the effort, noting that computing chips and storage media are constantly becoming cheaper and more efficient.  “We expect that phones will be powerful enough,” he contended, adding:  “The bitcoin blockchain is about 200 [gigabytes], and it’s growing about 60 gigs per year. And those numbers are reasonable to hold on a smartphone. Imagine the iPod with 256 gigs … of course the music fan wants to keep the whole music library but the crypto fan wants to keep the whole bitcoin blockchain.”  By letting users run full nodes, HTC is giving them the ability to verify data themselves, he said.  “[You can] be a part of the bitcoin revolution by contributing to the security of the whole network,” said Chen.  That being said, the EXODUS 1s will still be capable of conducting normal smartphone operations, with room for music, videos, pictures, apps and dapps.  Other blockchains?  HTC plans to support the bitcoin blockchain at launch, but Chen did not rule out adding support for other networks. The chief considerations include how much memory and bandwidth other networks would require, he explained.  “I think running light nodes, like ethereum for example, is definitely doable, [but] it all depends on the spec,” he said.  The company also plans to focus on public blockchains, which Chen believes are far easier to support than private networks. That said, HTC is not planning on adding support for any other networks explicitly at this time.  “I see bitcoin as one of the most important if not the most important blockchains,” he said. “We definitely want to support that first and given what bitcoin stands for, open, neutral, censorship-resistance.”  He also noted that bitcoin is “the most proven” network, and supporting it was at least a little symbolic as well.  Once HTC is able to launch the 1s, Chen expects that his team will be able to apply the experience from supporting a bitcoin node to other networks.  Ecosystem construction  Its new 1s falls in line with HTC's goal of contributing to the broader crypto ecosystem.  Demand from the EXODUS has been “in track” with HTC’s expectations, Chen said. However, the company is still soliciting feedback from the community. To that end, HTC is publishing its Zion Vault SDK for developers and ultimately plans to make its social key recovery mechanism available for other wallets to utilize (though there is no set timeline for this last part).  The company is also continuing to support its existing EXODUS 1 product, adding an Etherscan widget for customers to explore the ethereum blockchain and support for further non-fungible tokens.

The foundation's executive director, Aya Miyaguchi, announced the plan at the ConsenSys-organized Ethereal Summit in Brooklyn on Friday. Over the past year, the foundation spent roughly $27 million on its grants program, which supports critical projects across the ethereum ecosystem.  Speaking to the criteria the Ethereum Foundation upholds when deciding grant winners, Miyaguchi highlighted four areas of interest:  How important is the problem the team is working on?  How unique is the solution?  Will the grant produce second-order effects?  How urgent is the problem?  Last year's grants were awarded in five waves, with the first wave in March 2018 doling out roughly $2.5 million to 13 projects.  Since 2014, the non-profit has been supporting the development of the world’s second largest blockchain. Miyaguchi's analysis of 90 grants showed the largest amount of funding going to projects focused on blockchain scalability – with $13 million going into scalability efforts alone since March 2018.  Both Miyaguchi and ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin have said more information on the Ethereum Foundation's finances will be released in the coming weeks.

42381884,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9q0uL,1557571067,Bitcoin Price Hits 8-Month High Close to $7K,"View  Bitcoin printed an eight-month high of $6,964 earlier today. Further strengthening the long-term bullish bias is a bull cross of the 100- and 200-day moving averages (MAs) – the first since July 2015.  A sustained move toward the next resistance at $7,411 (September 2018 high) could be preceded by a price pullback, as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is currently reporting overbought conditions.  Pullbacks, if any, will likely be reversed by the historically strong 30-day moving average (MA), currently at $5,450.  The long-term bullish outlook would be invalidated only below the 200-day MA at $4,405.  There seems to be no stopping the bitcoin (BTC) freight train.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value jumped to $6,964 at 06:00 UTC today on Bitstamp, the highest level since Sept. 5, 2018, having found acceptance above the crucial 200-week moving average at $6,500 in early Asian trading hours.  Prices have set a new multi-month high for the fourth straight day and have rallied in excess of over 70 percent in the last 5.5-weeks.  Notably, with the sharp rally, the 100-day MA of bitcoin's price has moved above the 200-day MA. That is the first bullish crossover between the two averages since July 2015.  The development further confirms the long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change signaled by several technical indicators, including a golden crossover, over the last few weeks.  The moving average studies, however, are lagging indicators and have limited predictive abilities, as they take old price history into account.  Even so, investors may take heart as a similar crossover in July 2015 was followed by a 2.5-year bull run.  Daily chart  The 100-day MA has crossed the 200-day MA from below (see above left). The latest bullish crossover comes two weeks after the confirmation of a golden crossover of the 50- and 200-day MAs.  The last bull cross of the 100- and 200-day MAs (above right), confirmed on July 26, 2015, remained valid for 33 months, during which the price rallied 8,000 percent to a record high of $20,000.  With the next mining reward halving due in May 2020, the doors seem open for BTC rise further over the long-term.  The short-term outlook is also bullish. The 30-day MA is trending north with the price creating bullish higher highs and higher lows. BTC, therefore, looks set to extend the rally to the next resistance level at $7,400.  A pullback, however, may precede the next leg higher or the gains above $7,000 may not be sustainable in the short-term, as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is reporting extreme overbought conditions.  Also, it's worth noting that BTC suffered a temporary price pullback from $290 to $220 in the four weeks following the bull cross in July 2015 before picking a strong bid.  That said, with the long-term technicals biased bullish, the historically strong support of the 30-day MA, currently at $5,463, could again reverse deeper price pullbacks, if any.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $6,800, representing a 7 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42381881,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9q0t5,1557565506,Moving Beyond 'The Blockchain Is the App',"Mic Bowman is a principal engineer at Intel and a member of CoinDesk’s advisory board.  The following article originally appeared in Consensus Magazine, distributed exclusively to attendees of CoinDesk’s Consensus 2019 event.      Four autonomous vehicles arrive at an intersection. Who gets to go first?  Yeah, this sounds like the beginning of a bad joke, but the problem is very real, and surprisingly difficult. The solution lies in decentralized computing, an emerging field that will likely involve blockchains, along with a host of other technologies. To understand the problems it tries to solve, let’s dig deeper into this suburban impasse…  If we assume there’s no static infrastructure – for example, a traffic beacon – to arbitrate the intersection, the vehicles will have to negotiate a solution using only their in-vehicle computation capacity. What would the computer’s instructions be? Well, there are some general societal rules to go by: no one wants an accident; they all want to get through the intersection as quickly as possible; and there is some notion of “fairness” (“really, I got here first so I get to go first!”).  All this sounds more or less doable except that the vehicles might be augmented with a “little red button” that cheats the negotiation in order to get through first. (Seriously, if you were late for work, you’d push the button, right?).  From a systems architecture perspective, though, there are big problems with this scenario. Here are some: there’s no central authority deciding which car goes in which order. Second, the only infrastructure available for computation resides in the cars; that is, resources are dynamically allocated for the computation. Third, every driver is motivated by objectives that will drive their vehicle’s computation, and while some objectives – such as getting through the intersection without an accident – are shared by all, some goals will be unique to the individual.  (I’m late, so let me through first!).  It is this last characteristic that makes decentralized computing so challenging.  Applications and Challenges  Cryptocurrencies are the best-established applications of decentralized computing. But there are many others. In most cases, blockchains, which function as a decentralized, consensus-based alternative to trusting a centralized authority, will likely play a key role. Yet blockchains are useless on their own. For decentralized computing to work, blockchains must intersect with other solutions.  One much-discussed decentralized computing application is provenance in supply chains. Walmart recently announced that all its food suppliers must upload their data to a blockchain-based system so that users can monitor the supply chain for contaminated food. Similar ideas are being applied to tracking conflict-free minerals.  In these provenance cases, the blockchain is a critical component, but by no means the only one. As I discussed in last year’s Consensus Magazine, while a blockchain can provide persistent and transparent transactional management, storage and updates of data, the ability to track provenance also requires efficient, high integrity data entry. The quality of the blockchain’s monitoring is only as good as the data collected. Without proper oversight, data entry (for example. through sensor and telemetry data) may be manipulated by a malicious participant to misrepresent provenance.  Supply chain applications also demonstrate the importance of confidentiality and privacy of data because, at the core, they are about cross-organizational access to shared data. Queries on the data like “where did this lettuce come from?” are relatively uncontroversial and, in most circumstances, consistent with the shared objectives of the participants. Others are more conflicted, however, and it’s those that expose the difficulties in managing confidentiality in decentralized systems.  Can a supplier prove, for example, that it can meet delivery requirements without exposing otherwise confidential details of its internal operations? Herein lies a core problem for decentralized computing: how to perform network-wide computation on confidential data without exposing the details of that confidential information to the group.  Consider the challenges with genomic data. With researchers searching for cures to diseases, there’s tremendous societal and potentially business value in performing computations across the broadest possible set of genomic data sources, sources that are often created, managed or owned by different organizations. However, each database contains data that’s both highly valuable as intellectual property and restricted by regulations protecting the privacy of the individual contributors of that genomic data.  Dilemma.  Or we could just return to our autonomous vehicles, which are probably still sitting at the intersection. (“You go first.” “No, you go first”, “No, YOU go first”). A recent requirement for operating an AV is that it must have a “black box” that records telemetry data that can be used to analyze past behavior – for example, to determine the cause of an accident. This is basically the same role that a black box plays in an airplane – with one key difference: an airplane is largely by itself in the sky, whereas an autonomous vehicle is continuously interacting with other (potentially autonomous) vehicles. The black box in one vehicle provides a single historical perspective.  It does not, however, provide insight into the actions or decisions of the other autonomous vehicles on the road. All of this is complicated by adversarial machine learning, which could create a new attack vector for autonomous vehicles. How can a computer relying on a simple, local record of telemetry data differentiate between an internal error made by the autonomous vehicle, an external attack on the vehicle’s telemetry, or the actions of a malicious participant in the coordination protocol?  Ideally, to provide an attack-resistant history of the vehicle’s behavior, the black box would confirm the vehicle’s telemetry data with that of nearby vehicles as well as information about interactions with those vehicles – a full, system-wide snapshot, in other words. And that just returns us to the problem of doing computation with confidential information from untrusted sources.  Treating The Blockchain as the Trust anchor  The Internet of Things will demand decentralized applications. But building non-trivial versions of them is hard. Relatively straightforward problems like deterministic fair exchange between two parties is known to be impossible without a trusted third party to arbitrate the interaction. Here, a blockchain provides great value because it, in effect, becomes a technology-based, trusted third party that can arbitrate multi-party protocols. Still, we must address many other challenges before we can realize general purpose decentralized computing.  In part, getting there requires a transition from ""blockchain is the application"" to ""blockchain is the trust anchor.""  It’s a transition that we’re already seeing in bitcoin. For example, the Lightning Network moves the management of bitcoin transactions into an off-chain channel created by a pair of participants who will only close their balances to the blockchain if there is an off-chain dispute.  Thus the blockchain functions as the trust anchor while the Lightning Network is the decentralized application.  Meanwhile, Thunderella, a consensus algorithm developed at Cornell University, achieves substantial performance improvement by combining an optimistic, high-performance ""off-chain"" consensus protocol with asynchronous slow path that uses a traditional blockchain consensus protocol as a fallback trust anchor when optimistic assumptions fail.  In this case, the underlying blockchain’s role is to publish evidence that the optimistic assumptions no longer hold and to reset inconsistent views.  Our own work on Private Data Objects, a Hyperledger Labs project to explore decentralized computing models, splits contract execution into an off-chain component that performs the actual computation, and an on-chain component that simply ensures an ordering of updates that respects dependencies between contract objects. Thus, intuitively, the blockchain serves as a decentralized commit/coordination log for database updates.  Confronting the Confidentiality Challenge  How to scale this and protect confidentiality?  Well, one approach requires us to recognize that balancing the tensions between shared and individual objectives is simplified if we broaden our notions of successful computation. Under the principle of differential privacy, we can dial down, or “fuzz,” the required accuracy of a database to preserve confidentiality. For example, we might convert a precise result like ""the delivery truck is at 4th and Wilshire"" into something less definitive like ""the delivery truck will arrive in about 10 minutes.""  Consider how this concept – where some objectives must be met for success while others are ""fuzzed"" to complete the computation – might apply to our autonomous vehicles. It might not be necessary that the first vehicle to arrive at the intersection be the first one through the intersection so long as there aren't accidents and that it can continue to its destination in good time. Fairness and first-come-first-through remain the objectives, but may not be requirements for success.  Other advances in computer science might also help. Privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) such as Zcash and Monero demonstrate the power of cryptography to enable computation on a privacy-protected sets of data. Still, as of now, developers have struggled to take this computationally complex technology to the kind of scale that’s needed for general purpose decentralized computing.  Here, hardware-based trusted execution environments (TEE) offer a potential alternative. Many modern processors come with technology to perform computation that guarantees the integrity and confidentiality of computation under certain circumstances.  Examples of shipping products include TrustZone from ARM, Software Guard Extensions (SGX) from Intel, and AMD's Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV). For those more inclined to open hardware specifications, the Keystone Project from researchers at UC Berkeley and MIT, seeks to develop an open-source TEE for the RISC-V processor.  A hardware-based TEE provides a general-purpose compute environment that addresses performance and flexibility requirements that limit the applicability of ZKP technologies. However, hardware-based trust should not be viewed as a panacea. When it is situated appropriately in the larger security design context it could be an effective way to  execute confidential computation in an optimistic fashion.  In other words, decentralized computing requires a combination of solutions. I hate to tell them, but those cars stuck at the intersection are going to have to multitask.
