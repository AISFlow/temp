Ether, the digital asset used to power platform ethereum, reached $7, the lowest since 1st March, according to CoinMarketCap. The digital currency hit this price at 18:44 UTC, and then lingered at this price until rising to $7.01 at 19:01 UTC, CoinMarketCap data shows.  Ether prices quickly mounted a modest recovery, rising to $7.10 by 19:10 UTC.  Yet, ether experienced these price fluctuations amid modest volume, as 24-hour trading volume fluctuated between $13m and $14m when the digital currency lingered at $7.  The digital currency’s prices have been encountering headwinds as the ethereum platform has run into continued technical difficulties. Ethereum's developers have conducted three hard forks in four months, and the network unintentionally split late last month when two of the platform’s clients integrated different logic.

42427187,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0GXh,1480970927,New OCC Charter Could Give Bitcoin Exchanges Special Bank Status,"The office of the US Treasury in charge of currency policy has revealed plans to grant special-purpose bank charters to companies working in the fintech space.  The proposal, revelealed on Friday but hinted at as recently as October, is currently open to comment by the public. If approved, the new breed of chartered institutions would deepen a global trend that has leaned toward modernizing existing definitions of what constitutes a bank.  The impact on the digital currency and blockchain space would be far more meaningful, observers say. Should it be approved, the move could ""help drive greater mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency"", by giving approved exchange services a greater degree of credibility, according to lawyer Carol Van Cleef, newly hired by Baker Hostetler.  But Van Cleef went further, telling CoinDesk that not only could nationally granted bank charters give crypto-exchanges more credibility, but it would simplify the current US system requiring state-by-state money transmitter licenses.  Van Cleef said:  ""It will provide a solution to 50 state money transmitter licensing and it may create different impressions in the mind of potential cryptocurrency users if they’re dealing with a bank instead of a cryptocurrency exchange.""  According to Van Cleef, startup banks (which she has previously helped obtain traditional charters) are required to keep $2m cash on hand, but the actual cost of becoming a bank runs as high as $40m.  Van Cleef also attended the Georgetown University Law Center event at which Comptroller of the Currency Thomas J Curry related multiple reasons why the fintech chartershttps://www.occ.gov/topics/bank-operations/innovation/special-purpose-national-bank-charters-for-fintech.pdf could be helpful.  But the top benefit was ""public interest,"" he said.  ""It is clear that fintech companies hold great potential to expand financial inclusion, empower consumers, and help families and businesses take more control of their financial matters,"" Curry added at the time.  Without the FDIC  Notably, the new FinTech charter push is being undertaken without the involvement of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The OCC has ""taken the position that they don’t need new legislation to create a special purpose program for fintech,"" according to Van Cleef.  Companies that seek the charter would be evaluated regarding their likelihood of success, their risk management strategy, the effectiveness of their consumer protection and the strength of their capital and liquidity.  Jesse Powell, founder and CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, says that bitcoin exchanges have been ""captured"" by the existing ""ancient laws"", and noted that he welcomes the proposal.  ""Having a rational, federal license to run specific, limited banking functions would be a godsend to the fintech industry, which has to date been severely hobbled by the high costs and lack of options around licensing,"" Powell told CoinDesk.  Non-profit advocacy group Coin Center emphasized that, while the federal charter would ""open up"" the possibly of preempting state-by-state licensing laws, it would not completely eliminate the local option.  In a recent blog post, CoinCenter director of research Peter Van Valkenburgh wrote:  ""A federal charter would be a very sensible option for companies in the digital currency space who, because of the nature and of the Internet and digital currency networks, operate globally from day one.""  Times are changing  The plans, unveiled last week by the OCC, are aligned with similar efforts currently underway in Switzerland to create a ""crypto-bank"" for digital currency companies.  In March, the OCC published a white paper laying the groundwork for ""responsible innovation"" within the banking sector.  During a public comment period, several blockchain industry leaders (including Coinbase, Circle and Ripple) have published notes in support of a measure to modernize the regulatory body's requirements, making it easier for tech companies to serve their customers while still ensuring the protection of investors and consumers  Then, last month Switzerland’s own Financial Market Supervisory Authority published its plans to create an innovation-friendly environment in which newly conceived “crypto-banks” could thrive while still protecting interested parties.  The paper describing the fintech charter is currently available on the OCC’s site and a period of public comments will end on 15th January 2017.  While Van Cleef is excited about the potential impact the charter could have on cryptocurrency exchanges and similar kinds of services, she warns the compliance requirements would likely exceed anything the industry has experienced thus far.  Van Cleef concluded:  ""The standards that they’re going to have to meet to get a bank charter are much higher than what they’re being expected to do today.""

42427183,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0GTh,1480962147,US Federal Reserve Releases First Distributed Ledger Research Paper,"The Federal Reserve has published new research on distributed ledger tech.  The paper, which explores applications of the technology in payments and transaction settlement, was drafted by teams from the Federal Reserve Board as well as the Federal Reserve Banks of New York and Chicago.  Though research has been published in the past by members of the Federal Resrve system, most notably the Federal Reserve Banks from Boston and Chicago, the paper's release represents the first major release from the Federal Reserve Board.  Overall, the research casts a wide net, including both a top-down view of the concepts behind blockchain, as well as both the challenges and opportunities for financial firms or payment system operators looking at potential integrations.  The paper's authors wrote:  “An important goal of this paper is to examine how this technology might be used in the area of payments, clearing, and settlement and to identify both the opportunities and challenges facing its practical implementation and possible long-term adoption.”  Its publication comes just under two months after Fed governor Lael Brainard detailed the central bank's interest in the tech, as well as its intention to pursue in-depth research on the topic.  According to the Fed, researchers interviewed 30 representatives from both the public and private sector, drawing from established companies and startups working with the tech.

42427191,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0Ghh,1480957865,Malta Stock Exchange Lays Groundwork for Blockchain Testing,"Malta’s stock exchange is in the early stages of experimenting with blockchain-based trading.  The exchange quietly announced late last month that it was forming an internal ‘Blockchain Committee’ to guide the development of a strategic roadmap for testing the tech. The committee will be composed of the exchange’s senior leadership and stakeholders, as well as as-yet-unnamed “outside experts”.  The Malta Stock Exchange, which was founded in the early 1990s and reports a market capitalization of about €11bn, said it is also looking to create a broader working group in a bid to drive interest among the business sector in the island nation.  The exchange said in a statement:  “The Exchange will also soon unveil the Malta Stock Exchange Blockchain Consortium a think tank which will bring together experts from the Exchange’s stakeholders as well as from other organizations throughout Malta to share knowledge and perhaps joint venture on the design and implementation of blockchain applications.”  In taking these first steps, the Malta Stock Exchange joins the growing ranks of institutions like it worldwide looking at potentially integrating the tech into their systems or, in some cases, replacing it outright.  The most notable example is perhaps the Australian Securities Exchange, which in August unveiled a blockchain settlement prototype developed in partnership with Digital Asset Holdings, the startup led by former JPMorgan exec Blythe Masters. ASX has also moved to buy a stake in the startup, investing more than $17m to date.

42427190,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0Gdh,1480950026,US Commerce Department to Discuss Blockchain Copyright,"The US Commerce Department is hosting an event that will see discussion on how blockchain tech could be applied to digital copyright.  Scheduled for Friday, the event is being organized by the department’s Internet Task Force, which draws support from the US Patent and Trademark Organization (USTPO), the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), the International Trade Administration (ITA) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  The group was founded to explore a range of issues, from copyrights to digital privacy and cybersecurity.  The Commerce Department will be hosting a livestream of the event, a link to which can be found here. According to an agenda published by the Commerce Department, the event is being held at the USPTO’s Silicon Valley office.  The discussion is perhaps not a surprise given the idea that blockchain tech can play a role in digital copyright is being explored by a number of startups. The idea is that creative works can be linked to a transaction or digitized asset on an immutable ledger. From there, the provenance of that work can be traced to its origin.  The one-day gathering, which begins at 13:30 UTC, will include a panel session on ""registries and rights expression languages"", a discussion that is expected to focus on the use of blockchain tech.  Subsequent breakout sessions will feature blockchain and smart contracts as topics of discussion. And while no specific projects have been listed, the event will include a half-hour technology preview.  The department said in its release:  ""We will discuss the potential for interoperability across digital registries and standards work in this field, and consider the relevant emerging technologies (eg, blockchain technology, open-source platforms). We will also explore potential approaches to guide their adoption and integration into the online marketplace.""  Though the event signals the Commerce Department’s first public foray into the tech, its representatives have made overtures to the industry. Last summer, representatives from the department notably attended an industry retreat at Bretton Woods.

42427163,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0Aph,1480947332,Intel is Winning Over Blockchain Critics By Reimagining Bitcoin's DNA,"With so much R&D ongoing in the blockchain sector, it's hard for any new tech to separate from the pack.  In addition to the sheer volume of designs for these new types of financial databases, separating the interesting ideas often requires ample peer review, testing and time. Still, this messy process hasn't stopped tech giants like IBM and JP Morgan from conducting work that rivals the more well-known open-source creations like bitcoin and ethereum in aim and ambition.  While these contributions are grabbing headlines, however, praise across both open-source and enterprise communities has been rare.  Bucking this trend is Intel, which is winning support from even normally fickle technologists for its quieter, and some say, more innovative, approach to reimaging bitcoin's tech for the enterprise.  One of the main contributors to this perception is proof-of-elapsed-time (PoET), a variation on the system that bitcoin uses to ensure that computers in the network agree about which transactions really took place, which it unveiled earlier this year. Perhaps better known to cryptographers, this high-tech tool solves the computing problem of ""random leader election,"" or selecting who will create the next block of transactions.  Despite the lack of attention it's received, however, some veteran technologists consider PoET one of the more novel and radical proposals for how a blockchain network could achieve consensus.  Created by developers at Intel, PoET is notably designed to be used on a certain type of computer manufactured by the tech giant, called trusted execution environments (TEE).  On one hand, proponents argue that it's a more environmentally friendly algorithm than bitcoin's proof-of-work (PoW). On the other, many open-source developers are skeptical that could be widely used, since it requires trust in Intel.  Blockstream principal architect Christopher Allen, whose firm is a member of Hyperledger and one of the largest financial supports of bitcoin development, is one experienced observer that echoes this outlook.  Allen told CoinDesk:  ""I'm actually not very impressed with Hyperledger Fabric and I think that Sawtooth Lake deserves more attention.”  Mix and match  One of the reasons Allen thinks so positively about Intel's contribution is that it provides a variety of options and consensus algorithms, which he believes allow users to build a private blockchain to meets their needs.  ""Sawtooth as a proof-of-concept demonstrates that you can have multiple consensus algorithms,"" said Allen. ""There's no reason Sawtooth couldn't do PoW or proof-of-stake.""  Allen mentioned that the working group has been discussing how to create the best architecture for allowing users to choose from a variety of consensus algorithms.  That's where PoET comes in, as it’s one of the unique blockchain offerings that Sawtooth Lake makes available. Allen described it as a simulation of PoW that might be best used as an alternative for private blockchains.  Since it borrows from PoW's Nakamoto-style consensus, PoET offers some benefits over Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), a type of consensus algorithm used by Hyperledger, Stellar and others, he said. For one, it scales to a larger number of nodes and is more reliable since it works when larger numbers of nodes aren't available.  One downside is settlement finality: users need to wait for a certain number of blocks before they can be fairly certain that their transaction will be recorded.  But, despite these unique properties, another perspective is that PoET doesn't make sense for either private or public blockchains.  ""It's way too easy to create multiple layers of obfuscation that ultimately don't contribute to the underlying security model,"" said Bitcoin Core contributor Bryan Bishop.  Trust in Intel  The main critique to emerge is that participants would need to use Intel hardware like SGX to execute code in a protected area that can't be inspected or tampered with.  That's how you ""know"" — in theory — that the blocks filled with transactions will be dispensed at a certain interval, and that those transactions are correct. And you know that it can't be tampered because of cryptography involved.  ""PoET uses this special processor capability to regulate block frequency rather than computation,"" Sawtooth Lake project manager Dan Middleton said, explaining that by using the protected area of the chip, the code is executed as designed.  ""This is what enables the return to one-cpu-one-vote,"" he continued, echoing an idea invoked in Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin white paper.  But as for comparisons to PoW, there are notable differences. While PoW enables a trustless system, Bishop called Intel's approach ""trust-maximizing"".  That's why both Bishop and Allen are skeptical that the consensus algorithm can be used for a public blockchain, like bitcoin or ethereum.  ""It's like giving the keys to the kingdom to Intel,"" as Bishop put it.  ""The participants are saying, 'We trust Intel to not cause inflation of the system or otherwise interfere, and we believe Intel would rather shutdown before it would comply with government orders to disrupt a system that uses SGX,'"" he said.  Future possibilities  But while this probably isn’t good enough guarantee for decentralization advocates, this isn't stopping Intel's work from emerging as part of the conversation on the conference circuit.  Indeed, it may now be time for the wider market to assess how the idea could be evolved, for instance, for use on other processors.  As far as testing the protocol, a user doesn't necessarily need to purchase a TEE. Middleton added that anyone interested in the protocol can now test how it commits blocks across a distributed network.  Allen contends that the use of TEE is why PoET isn't currently as appealing as the more mature proof-of-work protocol, or maybe one day proof-of-stake, both protocols that enable participation via specific types of computer hardware.  But he agreed that if other hardware vendors implement the new algorithm, this could lead to other possibilities.  ""It would be powerful to see a multi-vendor standard for PoET be created someday, for instance in the multi-vendor RISC-V consortium,"" he said.  Like all ideas, it will be up to the market to decide. However, for now, it seems Intel's work has passed one milestone, graduating to larger dicussion and consideration.

42427162,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0Anh,1480941588,The Blockchain Milestone You May Have Missed,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and a member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following commentary originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.  Amidst the fanfare of the release of R3's Corda distributed ledger code, another milestone slipped by almost unnoticed – Hyperledger surpassed 100 members.  On its own, the news isn't that important – 100 is, after all, just a number. But combine the two reports, and you unearth a development that could define the future of blockchain.  Hyperledger was created a year ago as a unifying ""umbrella"" for enterprise blockchain open-source development. Among the participants are blockchain companies (including R3), financial institutions and tech giants.  Its approach so far has been a mix of fusion and fragmentation. The blockchain Fabric was created by blending submissions from founding members IBM and Digital Asset to create a flexible enterprise solution. Hyperledger's explorer tool is the result of combining code from DTCC, IBM and Intel projects.  At the same time as it became open-source, Corda was submitted to Hyperledger, where it will join Fabric, Intel’s Sawtooth and other protocols. Each runs differently, and while all are designed to work with financial transactions, each was created with different criteria in mind.  So it's logical to wonder whether Hyperledger will apply the unification or fragmentation approach to its newest submission.  Will Corda be incorporated into Fabric or Sawtooth? Or will ""components"" be stripped out to interact with other solutions?  Scattered clues  To see where this could go, we need to step back and look at the open-source business model.  R3 is a for-profit consortium (currently undergoing a financing round) that has open-sourced one of its main technology assets. Why? To expand its ecosystem, and to encourage developers to improve its functionality.  R3 will no doubt charge for related services such as security layers and consulting, and may develop proprietary apps that it can sell to clients.  It therefore needs to be intimately familiar with the underlying protocol, in order to build on it and commercialize the result. R3 is unlikely to consent to the fragmentation of Corda for broader application, or to the technology being incorporated into another protocol (although it probably wouldn’t object to the other way around).  Hyperledger is a not-for-profit group set up and run by the Linux foundation. Their roles are similar: to foster the development of their communities, encourage standardization and add a layer of governance. The foundation has over 200 members, and as well as shepherding Linux, it has a long list of “collaborative projects”.  Hyperledger has already started down that path.  No one blockchain  But as Hyperledger continues to grow, its members’ interests will spread and diverge. The idea of one blockchain for all becomes less feasible, and the necessary investment less practical.  Unlike with the Internet, we probably won’t end up with one technology standard in the blockchain space, however modular. And that may not be not a bad thing.  Instead of creating a hive of ecosystems competing for talent and users, the initial chaos is more likely to encourage innovation and open up virtually unlimited flexibility.  We're already beginning to see the emergence of a sector in which different solutions are starting to think about how to interact with each other.  We are getting a glimpse what the future of blockchain will look like.

42427166,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0Arh,1480938174,Japan's Central Bank is 'Test-Driving' Distributed Ledgers,"Japan’s central bank is testing blockchain tech but has limited its work to research, according to one of its senior officials.    Governor Haruhiko Kuroda spoke earlier today during the Paris EUROPLACE Financial Forum in Tokyo. In remarks, he spoke about the opportunities and challenges regarding new kinds of technology in finance today.  Earlier this year, Kuroda speculated that blockchain could reshape some financial processes, and in May called on other central banks to pursue research efforts like the ones currently being undertaken by the Bank of Japan. Some of the world's central banks, including those in Canada, Singapore and the UK, have moved in the past year and half to explore possible applications in the areas of transaction settlement and financial monitoring.  Yet according to Kuroda, the Bank of Japan isn’t looking to apply the tech to its own operations, instead focusing squarely on research.  Kuroda told attendees:  “Accordingly, the staff in the Payment and Settlement Systems Department of the Bank are deepening their understanding of such new technologies by test-driving distributed ledgers. Note that these trials by the Bank's staff simply aim to understand the mechanics of DLT, rather than applying it to the Bank's own liabilities or its payment and settlement systems.”  Japan’s financial sector, on the other hand, is putting its past research into action.  Last week, several major Japanese banks released the initial results of an interbank payments trial. According to those involved, the prototype system used enabled cheaper transactions compared to existing methods, setting the stage for further research.  Financial institutions across the Asian-Pacific region have spent much of the past two years investigating the tech, both individually and as part of consortia efforts.
