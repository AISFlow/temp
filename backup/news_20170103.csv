Released today  , the research note offers 10 market structure trends for 2017 and lists its expectations for the blockchain industry in its final slot. Author Kevin McPartland reasons that, while many in the industry had said blockchain is overhyped, he believes there might not be enough evidence to make this claim.  ""Our blockchain research was the most-read by our capital markets clients in 2016. In 2017, we'll finally start to see the rubber meet the road, with talk converting to real implementations,"" McPartland wrote.  McPartland went on to advise readers not to ""discount"" the value of digital currency.  He added: ""The ability to transfer value around the world with no middleman continues to have the biggest appeal.""  Overall, the research is the latest from the Connecticut-based firm, which earlier in 2016 forecast capital markets spending on blockchain would reach $1bn last year.

42427210,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0kTh,1483469732,India's Yes Bank Builds Blockchain for Vendor Financing,"Yes Bank has announced that it has built a blockchain-based vendor financing solution for one of its clients using technology from the open-source project, Hyperledger.  Built for consumer electrical equipment manufacturer Bajaj Electricals, with help from startup Cateina Technologies, the permissioned blockchain system digitizes how Bajaj Electricals is able to transact with its clients.  According to a press release, the solution allows Mumbai-based Bajaj to automatically debit customer accounts so that these companies can then purchase its own products.  In a statement, Yes Bank expanded on the benefits of this design, which included increased transparency, end-to-end auditing and the immutability of the blockchain that it would be using to secure files.  ""The entire process cycle for bill discounting reduces from four days (owing to manual intervention and transit) to almost real-time,"" the company said in a release.  In statements, Shekhar Bajaj, chairman and managing director of Bajaj Electricals, lauded the integration as one that takes a ""significant step"" toward what he termed a ""digitally integrated solution for supply chain financing"".  ""This solution enables us to do timely processing of the vendor payment through vendor financing from the bank without physical documents and manual intervention. It also enables us and our vendor to track the status of the transactions on real time basis,"" he said.  As noted by Business Standard, the announcement coincided with an increase in value for Yes Bank in public markets trading.

42427203,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0kJh,1483461958,"BitPagos Raises $1.9 Million in Funding, Rebrands as Ripio","Update (3rd January, 20:00 BST): Ripio has clarified that it has closed $1.9m in funding, but intends to raise $2.3m.          Argentinian bitcoin startup Ripio has announced what may be the first funding round of the new year, raising $1.9m in new capital amid a rebranding.      The company plans to raise an additional $400,000 in funding over the next 90 days via AngelList, bringing its total funding to $2.3m.      The Series A round was led by Huiyin Blockchain Venture, a China-based VC fund launched late last year by multi-billion-dollar investment firm Huiyin Group. Other participants in the round included Boost VC, Digital Currency Group and Draper VC – investors that also took part in the startup's $600k funding round in 2014.      Launched in mid-2014 as the startup's bitcoin brokerage (an adjunct at the time to its processor BitPagos), Ripio now becomes the company's flagship brand.      According to representatives, the decision comes as the startup's mission has shifted more toward consumer-facing services.      Ripio representative Juan Mendez told CoinDesk:      ""BitPagos is a brand that was too linked to merchants and B2B payment processing. Over the last year and a half, we've shifted most of our efforts towards users [and] consumers and we needed a brand that suits our mission best.""            Expansion bid    The round also caps a busy 2016 for the startup, as Ripio began offering bitcoin lending services earlier this year to customers based in Argentina.      According to Mendez, immediate plans for the new capital include growing its business development team and using those new resources to push further into South American markets. (There, the company says it serves more than 60,000 customers).      In late 2015, BitPagos acquired bitcoin exchange Unisend Argentina as part of its expansion plans, a move that coincided with a broader pattern of startup consolidations in the region.      The company is also looking to create growth in markets outside of the region, with a planned launch of its bitcoin brokerage and payment services in Mexico.      ""Our main objective for Q1 is to increase our user base in Argentina and Brazil, and (at the same time) expand to Mexico,"" said Mendez.    HBV's pattern    The funding is also notable as it was backed by HBV, a relatively newcomer to the investment scene that launched with $20m in committed capital in November.      Backing Ripio, however, is mostly in line with its previously announced moves.      So far, the firm has invested only in bitcoin startups, including India-based exchange Unocoin and content monetization project Yours.      Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripio.

42427218,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0krh,1483457400,Delaware's 2017 Resolution: Make Blockchain a Reality,"Andrea Tinianow is director of corporate and international development for the State of Delaware. There, she works alongside Mark Smith and Caitlin Long, the CEO and president of Symbiont, respectively, and Cooley LLP FinTech lead Marco Santori, on the Delaware Blockchain Initiative.  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Tinianow and her team provide an overview of the work ongoing in Delaware to migrate government services to distributed ledger tech.  If 2016 marked the year that Delaware became the first US state to implement blockchain technology, 2017 will mark another first.  This year, we expect companies will be able to file documents on our distributed ledger, in addition to current filing procedures.  But while we're just one state in one country, this move is no small feat – a large majority of the ""foundational"" documents of finance including incorporation documents (that form the foundation of securities markets) and UCC filings (that form the foundation of secured lending) – are filed here.  Delaware is home to more than 66% of Fortune 500 companies and 85% of initial public offerings, and many private companies and startups choose to incorporate in Delaware.  We anticipate that in 2017, filers will have the opportunity to use smart-contract versions of UCC documents on a distributed ledger, a move that helps us keep our historic first-mover status.  Work underway  For those who haven't been following, Symbiont engineers have been working closely with state officials since Delaware Governor Jack Markell launched the initiative in May.  In addition to ensuring that Delaware's regulatory environment is ""welcoming and enabling"", the Governor appointed an Ombudsperson (Andrea Tinianow) and a blockchain legal ambassador (Marco Santori). He committed the state government to using the technology (beginning with the Delaware Public Archives project), and asked the Delaware State Bar Association's Corporation Law Council to consider clarifying corporate law to authorize distributed ledger shares.  The Public Archives project is now in production, and it uses smart records to automate compliance with the state's document retention and destruction laws and create a means by which the Delaware Public Archives can generate new revenue streams.  Key allies have also emerged to support the Delaware Blockchain Initiative’s vision.  For example, Vice Chancellor J Travis Laster of the Delaware Court of Chancery, the Delaware court that handles disputes involving Delaware corporate law, has written that blockchain technology offers a solution to problems stemming from the complexity of the securities ownership structure in the US.  Other allies include the Delaware Division of Corporations (which has been an important partner in the Delaware Blockchain Initiative from the start), and the Global Delaware Team (from the Division of Corporate and International Development, resident in the Delaware Department of State).  Path forward  In 2017, we expect more updates.  The Delaware Blockchain Initiative's roadmap includes the issuance of legally-enforceable smart UCC filings, followed by the possible enactment of enabling and conforming legislation authorizing distributed-ledger shares and the offering of new registry services not presently offered by Delaware.  Smart UCC filings are next up for rollout, following completion of the Delaware Public Archives project.  While this may seem a smaller step forward, few may understand how critical a UCC filing is to the banking industry.  When a person or business takes out a loan using personal or business property (other than real estate) as collateral, the lender attaches a lien to the collateral to ""perfect"" its security interest by filing a UCC-1 Financing Statement with the Secretary of State.  Overall, the UCC process is still surprisingly paper-based, and therefore takes time and is subject to both errors and fraud.  We believe UCC filings on a distributed ledger will (1) automate the release or renewal of UCC filings and related collateral, (2) increase the speed of searching UCC records, (3) reduce mistakes and fraud and (4) cut cost.  By offering distributed ledger options, we're enabling significant improvements to the financial industry’s workflows.  Indeed, in this way, we believe Delaware is poised yet again to become the ""First State!""

42427204,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0kLh,1483452419,BBVA: Blockchain Regulation Needs to Move Beyond Bitcoin,"Spanish banking group BBVA has released a new research note on the subject of bitcoin and blockchain regulation.  Published on 2nd January, the note opines on the current state of regulation, arguing that rules for private blockchain use cases lag behind guidance for bitcoin – the digital currency it called the one blockchain application ""in practical operation"".  The document's author, BBVA digital regulation manager Javier Sebastián, contends that regulation will be needed to oversee enterprise blockchain use cases. However, he acknowledged that the current ""exploratory phase"" the technology is in makes this difficult to address.  Overall, the note argues for more immediate action to clarify issues that could hold back the launch of blockchain projects, calling for ""a legal framework in which its legal nature is defined, including the applicable jurisdictions and laws, as well as where responsibility lies in the event of error or malfunction"".  Sebastián writes:  ""There are some questions that are common to all cases, deriving from the unique characteristics of blockchain, which should be addressed as soon as possible.""  Elsewhere, the author contends that clarity is needed in regards to the legal validity of records stored via a blockchain and whether smart contracts are legally enforceable.  The research is the latest from the blockchain bank that emerged as one of the earliest institutional movers on the technology, investing in Coinbase and serving as a founding member of blockchain consortium R3CEV.

42427213,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0kbh,1483448764,State Street's Blockchain Strategy: Big and Bold for 2017,"State Street is on the verge of putting a significant amount of its workflow on a blockchain.  The financial corporation with $2tn in assets under management is now testing 10 early stage blockchain tools that could help automate everything from internal operations to transactions between business and consortia-level multiple-party deals.  Thus far, the bank has divided its efforts into three categories, each of which is being built largely independently of the others, bank officials said.  But as more and more applications become production-ready, their various functionalities will eventually be merged together, according to Hu Liang, head of State Street’s Emerging Technology Center.  Liang told CoinDesk:  ""We're creating an internal State Street Chain with the ability to plug in external adapters.""  Though the details of the blockchain have yet to be revealed, State Street is currently building applications for everything from securities lending to syndicated loans powered by a number of blockchains including ethereum, Hyperledger's Fabric and R3CEV's Corda.  The State Street Chain work is being developed as a ""blockchain agnostic"" distributed ledger that can integrate with open-source, public and private blockchain implementations.  ""We're just trying to understand what this new type of construct could lead us to while the underlying fabrics continue to mature,"" said the bank’s head of blockchain development, John Burnett.  Advanced stage  According to State Street, half of its proofs-of-concept (PoCs) are already past the prototype phase and are being worked on with other businesses as part of an effort take them live. The other half, Burnett said, are still to be turned into functioning prototypes.  While not all the blockchain PoCs are being made public, Burnett said the most basic implementations or ""blockchain-inspired"" applications will be ready before the end of 2017.  To State Street’s previously reported syndicated loan and securities lending PoCs, Burnett added an unannounced collateral management prototype, and there are others he wasn't yet able to mention.  Regardless, each application falls into one of three divisions, according to the blockchain chief, who was previously a strategy director for American Express.  The first category is solely for internal operations; the second for business-to-business transactions; and the third addresses multi-party transactions that rely on consortia-style arrangements.  From there, each of the prototypes are constructed to varying degrees with what might more broadly be considered blockchain technology. Prior to building the applications, State Street's blockchain developers broke down the distributed ledger technology into four components: shared data, distributed consensus, native cryptography and support for smart contracts.  Then, each of the components was built into the applications ranging from a full-blockchain implementation as was done for the syndicated loan application to a database application that centrally stores data, but still uses Merkle trees to do it.  ""What we think now is we don’t need all four of these value propositions to be functioning together to leverage the blockchain,"" said Burnett.  Automating from the inside  Yet, none of the 10 existing PoCs are what Burnett considers pure experimentation.  Instead, State Street is working closely with its various business divisions to identify inefficient parts of the workflow and experimenting with different ways to automate it using blockchain.  Instead of using the term ""smart contracts"" to describe self-executing code powered by a blockchain, State Street has dubbed them “smart workflows”.  Further, the bank's employees across business segments ranging from the Global Securities Services division to the Global Advisors division have been invited to internal educational events hosted by the ETC.  Liang said:  ""Doing this for ourselves has already gotten us to where we want to go, which is making ourselves more efficient.""  At the Boston-based events, as many as 300 employees have attended in person with an additional 1,200 viewing remotely via WebEx to learn about blockchain and start thinking about possible solutions to the problems they face on a daily basis, working with each other and outside institutions.  As a result of the educational sessions, the blockchain PoCs are being developed in a 'bottom-up' fashion, with business leaders helping steer the creation of tools that solve real problems.  ""In the mid-term,"" Liang said, ""we would like to take the same benefits that we’re experiencing internally and extend that to the clients.""  Blockchain partnerships  Specifically, Liang listed State Street’s blockchain prototype for OTC derivatives as an example of the kind of B2B service he’d eventually like to see benefit from the internal blockchain applications.  To build out State Street’s blockchain applications that rely on parties outside the bank, it is leveraging partnerships with a number of startups.  Currently, the only independent project that has been announced is with California-based commercial blockchain startup PeerNova, to build a distributed catalogue of investment assets.  Revealed in September, the partnership with PeerNova (which is backed by Overstock.com) is still ongoing, with plans to possibly expand.  ""Given their unique approach,"" said Burnett, ""we’re looking at other areas where we might be able to leverage that as well.""  Casting a wide net  While State Street has been able to make progress on its own for both internal blockchain applications and B2B services, some transactions are simply too complex to do alone.  For some of these more complicated applications, including syndicated loans, State Street relies on its membership to various consortia to learn and build.  As a founding member of R3CEV, State Street has been building with the now open-sourced Corda platform since before it was even publicly announced, said Burnett. State Street is also a founding member of Hyperledger, which recently announced its 100th member.  The large number of parties involved in syndicated loans, in which multiple parties fund a single loan, result in the investment vehicles having one of the longer settlement times, and being most ripe for disruption from a shared ledger of account.  Burnett said:  ""One of the things that we’re doing as a team, that’s really core to our mandate, is really casting a wide net between ... our internal development, experimentation and prototyping to the second track of working closely with different startups in the space, and the third track [which is] industry consortia.""  Blockchain bridge  All of State Street’s blockchain PoCs are being developed within a single division of the bank. Hu and Burnett both described it a ""bridge"" between the business divisions and the information technology department of the firm.  Called the Emerging Technology Center, the facility is largely based at the bank’s headquarters in Boston, though a contingent of the team work with Liang in San Francisco, and a few others are working from New York City.  Although the ETC team is experimenting with a number of technologies, blockchain is ""definitely the majority of what we’re looking at in the near future,"" Liang said. An account earlier this year placed the amount of blockchain work at 70% of the center’s entire workload.  And though Burnett reports progress is being made on all three fronts, he added that the first live blockchain applications – or ""blockchain-inspired"" applications as he describes tools that only use part of the technology – will be ready this year.  ""I do think that you’re going to see, certainly, internal applications of blockchain going forward in 2017,"" said Burnett. ""Just because it’s a lot easier in a lot of ways when it’s within your own walls.""  Potential roadblocks  A number of industry observers have noted two main obstacles that blockchain developers will face going into 2017: collaboration between ostensible competitors and regulation by state controllers.  To that list, State Street’s Burnett adds a third challenge – technology – which he expects will be rapidly overcome this year and going forward.  As part of CoinDesk’s industry predictions for 2017, the head of Thompson Reuters' Applied Innovation Group predicted that bank collaboration would drive blockchain’s success going forward.  And, just three days earlier, the CEO of venture-backed blockchain startup Coin Sciences predicted it would be exactly banks' inability to collaborate that would hamstring progress.  Addressing the subject, Burnett concluded:  ""There still remain those tech challenges, but those will probably be some of the more quickly resolved challenges, whereas a lot of the other one such as regulatory challenges, challenges in collaboration, those are the ones that are probably going to take a lot longer for adoption.""

42427208,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0kRh,1483447333,Coinbase's IRS Dispute Isn't Just About Bitcoin,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and is a member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.  This past week saw yet another move in the ongoing scuffle between the IRS and cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.  If you haven't been following the story, here’s a summary:  In November, the IRS presented Coinbase with a summons requiring the company to disclose client transactions between 2013 and 2015. Coinbase has hinted that they'd rather not.  Shortly thereafter, a Coinbase customer presented a motion against the IRS, alleging the subpoena was too broad.  This week, the IRS responded, saying what effectively amounted to ""go away"". It claims that since this client has identified himself as a Coinbase user, he is now excluded from the original summons, and his motion is irrelevant (which would make sense if all they wanted was the clients’ names, but the summons asks for much more than that).  This case has the bitcoin community understandably concerned. Aside from the violation of privacy, there is the strong impression that this is prosecutorial.  Simply through association with Coinbase, clients appear to be under IRS suspicion.  Deeper issues  The IRS is probably only after high-net-worth individuals, but the damage is done. If the request is successful, bitcoin users and businesses are likely to feel vulnerable, even when they've done nothing wrong.  But, the potential harm in terms of sentiment is not the most pressing concern. A deeper issue is insufficient regulation.  According to a November report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the IRS does not have a coherent virtual currency strategy.  When policy isn't being put to practice, this leads to confusion and unpredictability, neither of which create a good environment for development.  Usually, businesses and individuals are willing to comply with reasonable rules. Not knowing what those rules are leads to unnecessary expenditure and reluctance to engage.  Yet even that isn’t the main problem. A bigger concern is that we don’t know how to regulate cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin is eight years old, and lawmakers still don't have a clear idea of what to do about it.  Slow progress  That's not to say progress isn't being made.  Several institutions and governments are studying the problem, establishing working groups and publishing papers. A few seem to be moving down a path that the respective local ecosystems appear happy with.  To be fair, virtual currencies are still a minuscule part of the world economy, so they understandably haven't been a priority. Their presence is growing, however, and the disruptive threat is becoming more obvious.  Also, we are facing completely new circumstances. History is not lending us a hand here. Never before have we had such interpersonal connectivity, and the fallout from lack of control over information is not limited to the field of finance.  Add to the mix the slippery concept of bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies, and the confusion becomes even more understandable.  They don't belong to any specific jurisdiction, no-one controls them, and no official organization can influence where they go.  Hard ceiling  Which brings us to the question: Is it possible to regulate this new technology?  It helps to consider what type of regulation we want, and what it is we're trying to control. Consumer protection rules already exist in many jurisdictions. Anti-money laundering disclosure requirements are already part of the financial landscape. Neither are technology-specific.  Tax evasion isn’t, either. Cryptocurrencies may provide a vehicle, but the tech is not the problem here. The IRS move against Coinbase isn't about bitcoin – it’s about lack of information.  The implied threat and the accompanying publicity of the legal action will push some transactions elsewhere, perhaps to less cooperative environments. In the process, it threatens to damage a young network with significant potential to contribute to economic development.  Clear guidelines on disclosure requirements for individuals and businesses will help avoid the collateral damage from shortsighted summonses, but a sharper focus on what really matters will help clarify what rules are needed.  Just as this new technology is making us rethink the concept of value, so we need to re-evaluate what regulation is for, and what is needed to enforce it.  The issue is not cryptocurrencies or even their uses. The issue is information: what is necessary, and who provides it.

42427216,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0kfh,1483441622,Which Way for Blockchain Standards in 2017?,"Distributed ledger (aka blockchain) technology is crying out for standards.  Mutual distributed ledgers (MDLs), my preferred term for the tech, hold immense promise, providing multi-organizational databases with a super audit trail, owned by no one and everyone. Hence, the term ""immutable ledgers"", ""widely distributed"" and ""mutual"".  It's hardly surprising, then, that developers see a host of opportunities to transform business practices and offer new services, and businesses (although slightly less clear about the vision) see a host of opportunities to cooperate where it has been difficult before.  But businesses have been here before.  In the 1980s, electronic data interchange (EDI) was all the rage. EDI gave businesses standards for data communications, typically about business processes, facilitating the exchange of business information such as purchase orders, invoices or shipping notices. A landmark framework was eventually even put forth by the United Nations, the Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce and Transport (EDIFACT), in 1987.  Then again, in the 1990s, eXtensible Markup Language (XML) was all the rage.  The then-brand-new HTML (HypterText Markup Language) of 1991 was not rich enough to transfer business documentation, so a movement for an extension began. (XML is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents so they are both human-readable and machine-readable).  HTML and XML are older than they look. IBM's GML (Generalized Markup Language), developed in the 1960s by Charles Goldfarb, Edward Mosher and Raymond Lorie, begat SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) as an ISO standard in 1986, that in turn begat HTML in 1991, and XML around 1996.  Most EDI initiatives transformed into XML initiatives as the World Wide Web gained momentum. A leading example is SWIFT and ISO 20022, which defines XML financial messages.  So, what has all this to do with MDLs? A lot.  Anywhere there is a big pile of XML standards (even better, if they were originally EDI standards), there is a huge, pent-up demand for organizations to communicate with each other. However, along with technical difficulties, one of the big problems preventing such communication has been the need for a central third-party to control the communications.  A single third party can create a natural monopoly it might abuse, and MDLs remove much of that risk by providing a technology that no one owns and that everyone can keep their own copy of in the event of technical failure.  Businesses hunger to talk with one another without a central third party – MDLs are the ideal tool for this and can also re-energize XML initiatives. And there are a lot of them.  ACORD for insurers, essDOCS and Bolero for shipping and trade. And on and on …  One standard to rule them all  But what about progress so far?  In April 2016, Standards Australia, a non-government, not-for-profit standards organization proposed that the International Standards Organization (ISO) extend its mandate to include blockchain as a ""new field of technical activity"".  Later in September, ISO appointed Standards Australia to manage the secretariat of an international technical committee for the development of blockchain standards. This is worthy, but what is really needed?  MDLs will realize their potential to contribute to economic growth when the technology is widely diffused and used, and diffusion itself results from a series of individual decisions to begin using the new technology, decisions that are often the result of a comparison of the uncertain benefits of the technology with the uncertain costs of adopting it.  It is diffusion, rather than invention or innovation, that ultimately determines the pace of economic growth and the rate of change of productivity, and until many users adopt MDL technology it may contribute little to our well-being.  The key to ensuring widespread diffusion is ensuring that MDLs are viewed as safe, reliable technology.  Regulators have two primary levers they can use: regulation and standards. Regulation is sometimes a knee-jerk response by policy makers to perceived risk. While it can be speedy and authoritative, the process to create regulations can be distanced from the participants, resulting in unnecessary burdens or unforeseen consequences.  Standards, if implemented as part of a voluntary standards market with strict certification and accreditation can be highly effective – but strict certification and accreditation are essential.  Continuing on from work in 2014 and 2015, Long Finance researched the need for MDL standards during 2016.  Sponsored by the States of Alderney, PwC and the Cardano Foundation, the research aimed to answer four questions:  What are the potential risks associated with future widespread use of mutual distributed ledgers, and what are their implications?  How do distributed ledgers fit within existing regulatory frameworks, and are existing laws sufficient to cover the activities supported by distributed ledgers, or is new legislation is needed?  Would MDLs benefit from the development of standards, and which sectors and services might need MDLs most?  What different paths could be taken to create standards?  The study consulted over 80 people involved in MDLs, looking at a variety of areas where the technology might increase risk.  Potential Risk Areas For MDLs  Three risk areas occupied the thoughts of the majority of the practitioners:  Governance: Organizations will need to put in place many inter-organizational structures to manage MDLs. How will errors be corrected? Who will have authority to write to the ledger? Will there be a central authority who can make changes to the records, or change the entire system to help it evolve?  Liability and responsibility: How should high risk activities such as AML and KYC be handled? Who will 'carry the can' if things go wrong? What systems are in place to manage and resolve disputes?  Taxonomies: What exactly is any specific MDL in front of a regulator: permissioned or unpermissioned, public or private, opaque or transparent, proof-of-work or proof-of-stake? What are the tolerances and performance capabilities? These questions are of pressing concern to users but, as this is a rapidly developing field, a common language has yet to develop.  The research was published in November 2016 as ""The Missing Links In The Chains? Mutual Distributed Ledger (aka blockchain) Standards"", and concluded that in the majority of cases MDLs will support existing services that have existing processes and support technologies.  There will be a rich standards and regulation landscape that they must negotiate in order to be fit for purpose.  It found, too, that simpler, less regulated domains are more likely to adopt MDL approaches earlier, particularly where MDLs can solve an unaddressed problem (eg: know-your-customer, anti-money-laundering, ultimate-beneficial-ownership in financial services), and offer a difference to traditional central third party approaches (eg: meeting EU General Data Protection Regulation for the 'right to be forgotten' surrounding identity documentation).  Are new regulations needed for MDLs? MDLs will, in the majority of cases, be deployed into existing regulatory environments.  Unless regulations specifically stipulate the use of third-party intermediaries, they are likely to be sufficient to cover the activities supported by MDLs. Further, MDLs can piggy-back on existing XML work.  In a sense, the MDL is merely another way of messaging, but without a central third party and with a ‘super audit trail’.  Not so fast  Another notable conclusion was that some standards could constrain innovation too early.  While existing thematic standards, such as ISO 9000 for quality management or ISO 31000 for risk management, were probably flexible enough to cover the use of MDLs, there were three salient gaps:  Taxonomies and performance standards need to be outcome-focused sets of definitions and characteristics, so that regulators and potential purchasers can assess MDLs based on their outputs, rather than the mechanics of how they operate.  Data governance and liability standards need to pay fundamental attention to the civil liberty implications of data aggregation, sharing and mining.  Commercial governance and liability standards need to structure how organizations link legally and contractually with MDLs.  So how could an appropriate voluntary standards market be established?  Three potential routes present themselves:  ISO standards developed at a global level with national standards institutions and wider stakeholders. Standards Australia are considering this route on technical standards for blockchains. ISO standards carry immense credibility because of their well-established model for certification and accreditation, but the ISO path can be a long one.  Publicly Available Specifications (PASs) created with a national standards institution, perhaps later rolled-out as an ISO standard. This route has the advantage of creating standards which are close to the industries they are intended for, resulting in cost-effective and streamlined solutions.  Open process standards work up from industry participants, but can suffer from a tendency to certification and accreditation procedures, the end result can lack credibility.  ""The Missing Links in the Chains"" confirms that the establishment of a voluntary standards market may be beneficial in promoting MDLs by providing certainty to both users and developers, while assisting regulators in fulfilling their duties. A PAS route seems the most likely, but further consideration is needed on the scope of 'taxonomies and performance', 'data governance and liability' and 'commercial governance and liability'.  And of course, a big question lurks here, what group is prepared to pay to take independent standards forward?  Have an opinion on blockchain in 2016? A prediction for 2017?
