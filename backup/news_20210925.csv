Red Date filed in late July to register a nonprofit foundation in Singapore to manage the international version of the network, CEO Yifan He told CoinDesk.  Read more: China’s Latest Crypto Ban Is Its Most Severe, Insiders Say  The company hopes to bring international leaders from tech and financial services companies to the board of directors, he said.  The move is aimed at making the BSN into an “international standard open-source community” that, like the internet, isn’t controlled by any one entity. It might even step down from the board of the Singapore foundation at some point in the future, He said.  What is it?  The BSN is a blockchain development platform made available through cloud-based nodes in cities in China and abroad. Developers can access more than a dozen protocols, including Tezos, Nervos, Solana, Polkadot, Hyperledger Fabric, IRISnet, Algogrand, R3′s Corda and Baidu’s Xuperchain, among others.  Red Date’s headquarters sit on the outskirts of Beijing, in a building among countless rows of other identical office spaces. Most of its 150 employees are engineers. Nothing about the setting implies that the company is building one of China’s flagship blockchain projects. For most of its seven-year history, it wasn’t. Founded in 2014, it was working on smart-city projects with local governments in China until the BSN was begun in 2018.  Aspiring blockchain developers can buy a bundle of Blockchain-as-a-Service and cloud hosting to make decentralized applications. The bundle is cheaper and easier to deploy than most other alternatives, Red Date says.  The BSN also comes with interoperability protocols, enabling interconnected decentralized applications (dapps). By making this cheap connectivity-enabled blockchain platform around the world, Red Date hopes it will lead to global adoption of the technology and eventually become the de facto infrastructure for an “internet of blockchains.”  But the network is split into two versions to ensure compliance with Chinese authorities, who do not look favorably upon fully decentralized and permissionless chains like Ethereum and Solana.  In the Chinese version, permissionless chains are “adapted” into permissioned chains, thus becoming centralized and easy to control.  Read more: China Tightens Crypto Mining Crackdown, Bans Trading  The international version currently operates eight nodes in eight locations using Amazon Web Services, Google, and Microsoft Cloud servers. South Korea is the latest country to get its own BSN portal earlier in September.  CEO He declined to disclose data on the platform’s uptake internationally.  The origins  As the BSN seeks to attract developers to the platform, its Chinese origins are coming under scrutiny. One of the key questions is who is really in charge, according to Paul Triolo, head of geo-tech risk consulting at Washington, D.C.-based Eurasia Group.  Triolo argues that if the project is perceived as an attempt by the Chinese government to control blockchain development, it will likely fail to attract developers from around the world.  “The idea of a global blockchain internet is really interesting,” Triolo said, but the question is how to do this “in a way that wouldn’t be seen as a Chinese government alternative.”  Read more: Inside China’s Effort to Create a Blockchain It Can Control  The BSN Development Association, the committee that oversees the network’s buildout, is chaired by the State Information Center, a think tank under the National Development and Reform Commission, China’s highest economic planning body. Other founding members include state-owned telcos such as China Mobile and China Unicom, as well as payments provider China UnionPay.  Given this origin story, questions about the BSN’s independence from government interference have emerged.

42421055,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXBLTB,1632593979,Art Collectors Swoon Over NFTs at Elite Basel Gathering,"Ballers, bling and botox found their way to the Rhine this week as Art Basel finally opened following a 16-month delay. After the coronavirus, the art world was hungry for a good time in this quaint Swiss city. The tony event saw sales in the many millions and enough champagne to drown a small country. Princess Eugenie, daughter of disgraced British royal Prince Andrew, was seen selling canvases as global sales director of Hauser & Wirth.  The year’s buzziest art fair welcomed hoards of collectors, some on private jets, and many of them were curious about crypto for the first time. NFTs were everywhere, and collectors, clad in Margiela, moved around like culture-vulture locusts.  Art Basel doesn’t mark non-fungible tokens’ entrance into the world of fine art. Legendary auction houses Christies and Sotheby’s have moved heavily into the scene, sports stars who might be collecting Matisse are buying “PFPs.” But the presence of immutable tokens everywhere at one of the world’s most watched art functions is a sign of the times.  The Cologne- and Berlin-based Gallery Nagel Draxler sold an NFT by the crypto-artist Olive Allen (entitled “Post-death or The Null Address NFT”) for 8 ETH, about €25,000, on opening day of the fair.     “The fact that NFTs were exhibited at a major art fair like Art Basel is a huge milestone towards its acceptance as an art medium on par with painting and sculpture,” Allen told me.  Allen, an OG known for her series of cute bears in disconcerting situations, took part in the second genesis drop on Nifty Gateway. She has made several hundred NFTs and was recently included in the first Christie’s sale of NFTs earlier this year, where she was presented alongside artists such as Banksy and Takashi Murakami. In addition to her piece in Art Basel, Allen also dropped a piece this week in Time Magazine’s Build a Better Future Project, a collection of NFTs it is auctioning for charitable causes (somewhat chaotically).  One third of the Gallery Nagel Draxler booth is curated by artist, curator and critic Kenny Schachter, who plastered the word “NFTism” on the walls and floor, turning it into a veritable crypto-kiosk. He predicted it would be the first among many at future editions of Art Basel.  Schachter also presented his own collectible series called Crypto Mutts, selling 9,000 editions of the series on opening day of Art Basel for .03 ETH each. In a Zaha Hadid Architects designed virtual reality exhibit (”metaverse”), Schachter presented a series in opposition to the NFTs projects like Bored Apes and CryptoPunks, which have often become profile pictures for the famous, rather than artworks in their own right.  “Convincing the traditional art world to appreciate NFTs for what they are – a delivery system for collecting digital art – is worse than getting torn to shreds by Discord dissenters for not getting my rarity traits in order fast enough,” Schachter said.     “The digital art universe can be blood-lusty and make the elitist traditional art snobs look like amateurs in comparison,” Schachter went on. “But I’d rather be ripped another asshole for tech problems and lack of specificity with the rarity traits of my Crypto Mutts in the land of NFTism any day of the week than the past-their-sell-by-date art gatekeepers.”  Also on view in the same booth was an edition of Ridler’s Mosaic Virus, a take on “tulip mania,” a market crash that took place in Holland in the 17th century (an analogy frequently employed by critics of crypto’s market dynamics). The piece sold for nearly 9 ETH. That work is presented in the booth alongside an NFT by Kevin Abosch, which sold for approximately 15 ETH by early evening on preview day.  Galerie Nagel Draxler took a somewhat unconventional approach to selling NFTs at Art Basel, allowing collectors to pay in fiat off the walls but then purchasing the items online and storing the work in a digital wallet to finish the sale.  “Some traditional collectors are totally not familiar with these procedures,” said Denise Kokko of the gallery to Artnet. “So we made an exception. We are trying to make NFTs accessible.” When I asked why they chose the traditional art fair model to present an emergent art form and medium seemingly antithetical to it, the gallery waxed philosophical.  “The most interesting crypto art is yet to come,” a spokesperson said. “As Walter Benjamin put it, new technology is first executed in the aesthetics of the era past.” (This is a theme echoed in a column recently by CoinDesk’s David Z. Morris.)  The Berlin-based König Gallery, for example, who had previously worked with both Olive Allen and Kenny Schachter in a metaverse exhibition, opted for a more traditional booth at Art Basel selling mostly paintings and sculptures.  The Tallinn-based Temnikova-Kasela also presented a more traditional booth at the fair, despite their wild success earlier this year with the launch of their Mutagen project, a collaborative NFT featuring Tommy Cash, Ilja Karilampi, Nik Kosmas and Katja Novitskova that has since sold over 600 editions at .01 ETH with a trade volume of 78.4 ETH on OpenSea. “It is still the wild west in the NFT market when it comes to institutional art presence,” Olga Temnikova said. “Big [art world] players are not massively in, so art media does not look into it as carefully.”  Decentralization means utilizing technology different from the way it was intended to be used  Meanwhile, at a nearby art fair called June, the artist Tobias Kaspar presented a fresh take on an NFT that primarily took a physical form. He stitched QR codes inside 500 stuffed bears, so buyers were only able to access the accompanying NFT after purchasing the physical toy and ripping it open to reveal the code.  “NFTs are a tool that enable us to reach a whole new audience. They open the door for the crypto community to works of art that have real significance,” Christian Andersen, co-founder of June Art Fair.  June Art Fair offered galleries a chance to mint a work on its platform (Juneart.io). One of those, Jeffrey Rosen, said he had sold several pieces and welcomed its addition as an addendum to the traditional art fair model.  “We are cultural producers providing content for currency, where that leads, is a question mark,” he said.  The art critic and über curator Hans Ulrich Obrist said crypto and NFTs can usher in new networks of interdisciplinary alliances. “Decentralization means utilizing technology different from the way it was intended to be used,” he said. “We need a detournement.” (Meaning to innovate, somewhat subversively.)  But other collectors and advisors cautioned against widespread adoption of crypto and NFTs in an industry notoriously object heavy.  “Objects are a way of turning money into trouble,” said Michael Short, an adviser active since 1986. The way that crypto entered the fine art ecosystem has been predictable, Short said, but noted that several collectors in crypto were wary of hodling paintings and sculptures.  Objects that take up physical space and require physical care are “trouble,” he said. “An object requires time, energy and money for the maintenance of its existence – shipping, storage, repair, replacement,” Short said.  Contemporary art adviser Daria Borisova sees an emerging business in helping both traditional art collectors who want to enter the NFT market and crypto whales who want traditional beaux arts.  Recent trends seem to support claims that collectors are willing to make a leap into digital. According to a mid-year art market report published by the Swiss Bank UBS in September, 48% of 500 collectors surveyed said that they would be interested in purchasing digital art in the next 12 months, an increase in the year before.  Kamiar Maleki, director of the adjacent Volta Art Fair taking place in Basel, agreed, having got into NFTs this past summer. In July, Maleki curated what the Art Newspaper described as the first NFT art residency, which took place at the Four Seasons Grand-Hotel Cap-du-Ferrat in southern France. The project featured the British hip-hop musician Tinie Tempah, alongside visual artist Sassan Behnam-Bakhtiar and Vector Meldrew, who came together over a week in the idyllic French estate to produce and sell an NFT on Nifty Gateway.  Maleki also said the Volta Miami Art Fair, scheduled to take place in December, would be presenting a Superrare booth, which will produce and exhibit a NFT to be minted and sold during the opening days.  NFTs will inevitably play an important role in the future of collecting and fairs  “Art fairs are about innovation and discovery,” Maleki said. “NFTs will inevitably play an important role in the future of collecting and fairs.”  The Volta Art Fair in Basel presented two galleries that offered NFTs for sale: MeetFrida Art from Hamburg and Fiumano Clase from London, signaling where the winds may be blowing.  With the pulse of Art Basel an indication of new technological and cultural trends, it would seem that the contemporary art world is now more poised than ever to adopt crypto and blockchain technologies.  The trick may be in convincing NFT artists to care about the traditional art world. With intellectual snobbery and elitism perhaps a defining characteristic, change from within is unlikely.  But never discount the will of an art adviser showing up to Day 1 of Art Basel knowing full well that money speaks loudest and clearest.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Dorian  Batycka,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/25/art-collectors-swoon-over-nfts-at-elite-basel-gathering,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f7bd3f7f572b88023abe4124a0f13e77dd6bc747-1536x2048.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It was these two functions that became the foundation for the emergence of the DeFi phenomenon, which ultimately became something of a spontaneous market response to the request for freedom of financial services and their equal provision to any participant in the ecosystem, regardless of the social status and geographic location.

A representative from Huobi told CoinDesks the company has “no comment” on the subject.  “The regulatory pressure in China this time may be very high,” Wu said on Twitter. “The exchange began to react.”  Just a day ago, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) published a notice containing vastly stricter restrictions on crypto trading, so strict that trading would effectively be banned if enforced rigorously. According to the notice, which was co-signed by 10 agencies, anyone facilitating trades is subject to legal prosecution, including those individuals who live inside China but work for off-shore crypto exchanges that provide service to China.  Huobi is one of the most popular crypto exchanges among Chinese crypto users. The other two major exchanges used by Chinese are Binance and OKEx. Neither Binance nor OKEx require new users to specifically disclose their country/region on the initial registration page.  The Sept. 24 notice also bans banks and other financial institutions from offering services related to crypto, including transactions of fiat to crypto currencies, or from one crypto to another. The measure likely will target over-the-counter (OTC) services that allows Chinese to exchange their fiat Chinese yuan (CNY) into crypto assets in order to participate in crypto trading.  By press time, OTC service to exchange CNY for the dollar-linked stablecoin tether is still available on Huobi. However, the prices quoted in Chinese yuan on tether by OTC traders on Huobi’s peer-to-peer (P2P) market has dropped as low as 6.26 yuan.  Under normal market conditions, the price of tether expressed in Chinese yuan should match that of the U.S. dollar’s exchange rate with the Asian currency. However, the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to CNY is at around 6.46 yuan at the time of writing.  A discount of the price for the USDT/CNY suggests selling pressure on tether, a cryptocurrency used to convert fiat to crypto and back again that is popular among Chinese, has intensified.",NEGATIVE,USDT,ASIA | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING | USDT,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/25/huobi-appears-to-have-suspended-mainland-chinese-new-user-registration,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7dcf3bc39c2ec750f8cc0980a62a060770f36cdc-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Gaming, for example, is one of the handful of industries that were extremely open to blockchain technology from the early days, immediately seeing potential in its cheap and quick payments. This was perfect for microtransactions, ensuring immutable ownership of various collectibles, and alike. It wasn&apos;t long before gaming and blockchain became so well-connected that games started launching on the blockchain itself. One of the biggest upcoming examples of this is CowboyZombies, a new Shoot-to-Earn game inspired by shows such as The Walking Dead and zombie games like Left 4 Dead. What is CowboyZombies All About? As the name suggests, CowboyZombies pitches cowboys in their fight for survival against zombies. The game sets you in 1970, although it gives off a strong old west feeling. In it, cowboys are living their best lives, herding their cattle, hunting deer, and occasionally solving problems like chasing bandits and other criminals. This all changes when the zombie attack starts, and cowboys are forced to use all of their skills to fight for survival. They have a variety of guns and knives at their disposal, and there are 5 ranks of cowboys and cowgirls fighting against 4 different types of zombies.

Cryptocurrency adoption looms on the horizon with its crossover with gaming. Crypto mobile games popped up, but more recently, NFTs games have emerged.

Traditional game models bought from a store or online retailer give the thrills of entertainment but do not give that much freedom of innovation. Hours of playing does not sometimes redeem hours invested on characters and items unlocked. Players want something more than fleeting enjoyment. What if the ownership of in-game experience and items wasn&apos;t just digital but tangible as well? Enter Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).

CryptoTanks, a new game running on Polygon and Binance Smart Chain, leverages NFT technology to empower the players. Bringing a military and shooter-oriented game to the play-to-earn ecosystem is a further expansion of this growing ecosystem. The CryptoTanks Game Explained Several play-to-earn blockchain games have proven successful in recent months. Ranging from Axie Infinity to StarAtlas and MOBOX, there is a lot of momentum in the space.

CryptoTanks follows along the same train of thought, although its game is slightly different. The military theme is a different spin on blockchain gaming, as there is still a limited amount of playable game genres today. However, any game can use blockchain technology and NFTs to empower its players, and there is still much exploration. The mechanics of CryptoTanks are comprehensible: play the game by using in-game tanks, participate in battles, complete quests, and upgrade machines to increase their characteristics and value.

42396857,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT638i,1632533235,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Stabilizes After China Crypto Ban Sell-Off; Volatility to Remain Elevated,"Bitcoin is stabilizing above the $40,000 support level after China’s latest crypto ban triggered immediate selling. BTC is down about 11% over the past week, compared to a 15% decline in ether over the same period. Analysts expect volatility to remain elevated given the regulatory headwinds.  Exchange tokens, especially those with a large share of Chinese users, also sold off on Friday. Huobi’s token was down about 23% over the past 24 hours and the token of FTX was down 12% over the same period.  “Around 10% of global bitcoin volumes come from OKEX and Huobi; China regulation pulled that down from 30% in 2019,” James Butterfill, investment strategist at CoinShares, wrote in a LinkedIn post on Friday. He added Friday’s crackdown should not have a major impact on crypto prices overall.  Still, some analysts emphasized the importance of China’s regulation. “At a stroke, effectively, one in seven of the world’s population is now officially frozen out of the crypto asset market,” Simon Peters, analyst at eToro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “Until now crypto was well-established in the region, making its total exclusion a significant event.”  And regulatory pressure is nothing new to crypto markets. Analysts and traders continue to track government crackdowns, which typically occur during volatile trading periods.  “This is not the first time such an announcement has come out of China, as it had enacted similar punitive measures in 2013 and then again in 2017, following the ICO (initial coin offering) craze,” FundStrat, a global advisory firm, wrote in a report on Friday.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC), $42,426, -5.2%  Ether (ETH), $2,913, -7.3%  S&P 500: +0.2%  Gold: $1,747, +0.2%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.456%  China crypto crackdown  The People’s Bank of China posted a list of forbidden activities that included some previously in the gray zone of regulation, while the National Development and Reform Commission set out a plan to phase out mining entirely, reports CoinDesk’s Eliza Gkritsi.  The notice banned banks and other financial institutions from offering services related to crypto. Further, regulators said they want to establish a mechanism for early warning and stopping “hype” in crypto trading and mining activities.  Crypto mining is to be deemed an “outdated” industry, according to regulators. No new projects are allowed, and existing ones will be given time to exit.  On Friday, CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen interviewed experts who said China’s latest crypto ban is its most severe action. Read more here.  Miners exit China  Miners have been fleeing China in the months leading up to the latest crypto ban. The chart below shows crypto miner migration to Kazakhstan, the U.S., Argentina and other nations.  “Kazakhstan has been one for the biggest beneficiaries of China’s long-standing adversarial approach to crypto-mining,” FundStrat wrote. “With a cost of roughly $0.03–$0.04 per kW/h (depending on the tenge-dollar exchange rate), electricity tariffs in Kazakhstan are among the cheapest in the world,” FundStrat added.  Ether at critical support  Ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, dipped below the $3,000 support level on Friday. ETH was down about 8% over the past 24 hours, compared to a 5% drop in BTC over the same period.  Buyers will need to defend support above the 100-day moving average, currently at $2,735, to resume the rally since July. If broken, ETH will need to avoid falling below $2,600, where a majority of long liquidations could occur as discussed in last week’s Market Wrap.  Failure to hold support could trigger further downside toward $2,000, although short-term buyers could remain active given oversold signals on the charts.  On a related note, the chart below shows ETH trading volumes outpaced BTC on the Coinbase exchange last week.  Additionally, “SOL has firmly established itself as number three, ADA also remains an important contributor to overall volumes, while ALGO has been catching up similar to the previous week,” Coinbase wrote in a newsletter to institutional clients on Friday, referring to currencies related to the Solana, Cardano and Algorand protocols.  Altcoin roundup  SEC hints at Tether probe: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may be investigating Tether and Tether Operations Limited, reports CoinDesk’s Nikhilesh De. The SEC said it would not release records around Tether because they were collected for enforcement purposes, according to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) response to a staff writer at The New Republic. “We are withholding records that may be responsive to your request under 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(A). This exemption protects from disclosure records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement activities,” the response said. The SEC response also said the withholding of records for the law enforcement exemption does not necessarily mean any charges or enforcement actions will be brought.  The Central Bank of Chile will set up a team to study digital currency issuance: The Central Bank of Chile is exploring the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), reported CoinDesk’s Andres Engler. Any possible currency would be issued in a similar way to banknotes and coins, and could be used for transactions in commerce or between individuals, or for financial institutions to settle peer-to-peer payments, the central bank said.

42413831,QGYAr3uO7Twscje5zZSItm,1632533189,China’s Latest Crypto Crackdown Draws Yawns From Bitcoin Market Vets,"A fresh crackdown by Chinese authorities on cryptocurrency trading sent bitcoin tumbling on Friday.  But to veteran traders and analysts in the notoriously volatile market, it all seemed like a big bag of déjà vu – the seventh, 100th or “eleventy-seventh” time (in one analyst’s words) that China has cracked down on crypto.  Bitcoin’s price was down about 4% over the past 24 hours to about $42,150. That’s still up from about $29,100 at the start of 2021, for a 45% year-to-date return. That’s more than double the gains of the S&P 500 index.  Here’s what cryptocurrency analysts are saying:  Ulrik K. Lykke, executive director at crypto hedge fund ARK36:  “Yet again, the Chinese government has cracked down on bitcoin. Since 2013, it has done so at least seven times now – and twice this year already. While each time this happens, the markets react with a price drop, each time the effect is smaller and more short-lived. The ‘China bans bitcoin’ story has gained almost a meme-like status in the bitcoin community because of this.”  Haohan Xu, CEO of Apifiny, a digital-asset trading and mining network:  “China’s latest move is not surprising given its history of anti-crypto actions. ... If China continues to enforce at this magnitude, crypto trading will shift to venues in countries with more stable regulatory environments, which means more predictable liquidity and healthier, more robust trading across the globe.”  George Zarya, CEO at digital-asset prime brokerage and exchange Bequant:  “For the institutional crypto industry it won’t change much, as those who could leave already left, and those who couldn’t have either closed or gone under the radar. The retail market most likely has gone under the radar and will continue to support market volumes.”  Anthony Pompliano, investor at Pomp Investments:  “It would seem like a negative thing to have China ban bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but the market barely cares after the 100th time.”  Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics:  “China bans bitcoin. This must be the eleventy-seventh time they’ve done this. Anybody still using bitcoin there is already underground, so now they’re a criminal too. Big whoop.”  Craig Erlam, senior markets analyst, Oanda:  “China’s opposition to cryptocurrencies is nothing new, but the latest clarification would suggest those involved are at risk of prosecution. China’s actions haven’t held back crypto’s rise too much in the past, so I wouldn’t be surprised to see it bounce back once more.”  Fundstrat, an independent investment research firm:  “While we are witnessing an immediate sell-off, there does appear to be buying support coming online as market participants digest the information.”  Freddie Williams, sales trader at GlobalBlock:  “We’ve seen little in the way of knee-jerk reaction from clients surrounding this news from China. We’ve also seen this before from China, where news of bans have been reported over the years, but it has not prevented adoption of bitcoin and digital assets from continuing their upward trend.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/24/chinas-latest-crypto-crackdown-draws-yawns-from-bitcoin-market-vets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1015dde522ef326b0be42591a52370d74f450a3f-6070x4047.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Even though the existing networks are supposed to be safe and secure, attackers often find loopholes to exploit them in the bid to steal investors&apos; funds. This is not new in the online world. There have been occasions when hackers even forced companies to shut down. The decentralized finance sector has seen a lot of growth in recent times, but the growing exploitation cases are becoming alarming. Many protocols have suffered such attacks amounting to losses to the tune of millions of dollars. The latest to record such an exploit is Vee Finance based on the Avalanche Blockchain. Hackers stole $35 million from this protocol a few days after its mainnet went live on the host network. Before reporting this incident, Vee Finance stopped all its transactions on September 20, 2021. The team suspected questionable activities in the network and had to stop rendering services to users. Vee Finance Lost Money In BTC And ETH The two cryptos that hackers stole are BTC and ETH. The total number of BTC was 214, while ETH was 8,804. Checking the value of both at press time, the amount was above $35M. According to what the team revealed, the hackers targeted a particular address through the trade contract address of the protocol.
