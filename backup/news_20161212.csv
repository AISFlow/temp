42379073,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7muQr,1481577022,Bitcoin's Price Continues to Hover Just Dollars Below its 2016 High,"After a month of toggling, the price of bitcoin remains just out of reach of its annual high.  Since November, the digital currency has repeatedly neared $781.31, the high it set in June, and as we head into the year's final weeks, this game of cat-and-mouse shows no signs of stopping.  Bitcoin prices continually surpassed $779 today, rising to as much as $779.35 at the time of report, data from CoinDesk’s USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) reveals. This mirrored bitcoin's monthly movements, which have seen the price rising to $778.14 on 2nd December and falling back to as little as $757.83.  Yet, bitcoin's consistent inability to surpass its annual high of $781.31 could mean this particular level is providing resistance. Should bitcoin surpass this price, it could become a support level, helping provide tailwinds for the digital currency’s price.  Still, bitcoin prices have enjoyed a steady, upward movement over the last week, surpassing both $760 and $770, meaning it could well set a new annual high before the year is over.

42379070,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7muN5,1481566730,New Paper Explores Cryptocurrency for Space Colonies,"Blockchains in space?  According to one research paper published by an Indian government official, the idea isn’t so far-fetched.  Dr Kartik Hegadekatti of India’s Ministry of Railways posits in a new paper, entitled “Extra-Terrestrial Applications of blockchains and Cryptocurrencies”, that the tech could provide the basis for a space-based money in lieu of paper money or physical coins. Hegadekatti works for the ministry's Commercial Department.  Hegadekatti has written about cryptocurrencies in the past, exploring how a ‘NationCoin’ could be issued by a country in a paper from August. The paper's timing is notable, given India's controversial push away from paper currency and a rise in bitcoin purchase activity in the country.  Though the concept sounds a bit far-fetched and entirely speculative – humans have only set foot on the Moon a handful of times, and to date no manned mission has been launched to Mars – Hegadekatti argues that launching paper or coin-based monies into space is impractical given their cost and weight.  According to Hegadekatti, each planet or moon-based colony in the solar system could, in theory, have their own blockchains, synced together.  He wrote:  ""By the time man has setup a full-fledged colony on Mars and moved beyond the Kuiper (asteroid) belt, the extra-terrestrial economies can be linked by an intricate network of controlled blockchains. There can be a MarsCoin, on a Martian blockchain, LunarCoin, JupiterCoin, SaturnCoin, TitanCoin, and so on, on their respective controlled blockchains.""  Even cryptocurrency mining – the process by which new transactions are added to the blockchain – could be performed in space.  ""Powerful microprocessors embedded in objects flown to (or created on) Mars can do 'smart mining' and provide the basis for a money exchange system. Machines containing embedded chips will 'smart mine' cryptocurrencies which can be used for Extra-Terrestrial transactions,"" he wrote, concluding:  ""Thus, machines launched into outer space will automatically add value to the world economy.""

42379067,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7muGn,1481554818,27 Financial Firms Form Korean Blockchain Consortium,"A new blockchain consortium has been formed in South Korea, with both established finance firms and technology startups on its membership roster.  According to one of the group's members – blockchain startup The Loop – the new initiative will focus some of its efforts on building tools for managing trade finance processes.  The firm said in a statement:  “Beyond providing [the] blockchain-based authentication and information sharing system, we collaborate with other technology providers on developing a prototype for financial services in areas of securities trade and post trade, the prototype that is to reduce the cost and operational risk in trade finance, and ultimately improve trade efficiency.""  Some of the consortium's members, including Daishin Securities, have already pursued blockchain applications of their own or in tandem with regional startups. However, the consortium effort, with a current membership of 27 companies, takes those efforts one step further.  Other members of the new group include Dongbu Securities, Yuanta Securities Korea and Kiwoom Securities.  The blockchain effort was organized in part by the Korea Financial Investment Association, an industry trade group in South Korea.  Government interest  The new initiative is the second of its kind in South Korea, and its formation last week comes on the heels of a separate consortium initiative spearheaded by the South Korean government.  In late October, the East Asian country's government began putting the pieces in place for its public-private consortium, back by major South Korean banks and their top regulator, the Financial Services Commission (FSC).  ""With the creation of the consortium, momentum is expected to start for spearheading the development of technology and service in the blockchain field, rather than passively following the footsteps of advanced nations,"" FSC chairman Kim Yong-beom was quoted as saying by regional news service Yonhap at the time.  Specific elements of the government-backed consortium include the formation of a task force drawn from the banking sector and other agencies that would ostensibly regulate the technology. Forums for information sharing and joint development of projects are also planned.  Perhaps most notably, the government has expressed interest in seeking solutions to potential regulatory problems in conjunction with the consortium, suggesting that the group could become a focal point for blockchain development in South Korea.

42379043,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mqyz,1481551249,Dutch City Trials Blockchain for Real Estate Contracts,"Deloitte's Netherlands branch is working with the city of Rotterdam to create a prototype for recording lease contracts on a blockchain.  In conjunction with the Cambridge Innovation Center (a real estate services firm based in the US), the project will focus on developinghttps://www2.deloitte.com/nl/nl/pages/over-deloitte/articles/for-the-first-time-lease-agreements-are-recorded-in-blockchain.html a platform for managing housing transactions. The area is one being explored by several startups, with the Rotterdam trial representing the latest effort to bridge the real estate industry and blockchain.  The first part of the process involved building a mechanism for recording lease agreements. From there, those involved with the project say, testing will move to payments for real estate transactions in conjunction with the agreement recording tool.  Jan Willem Santing, a manager of real estate advisory services at Deloitte, said in a statement:  ""The next step will be monitoring the rental payments. By implementing additional blockchain applications in the real estate industry transaction times and costs can be reduced further. Furthermore, it enables decision makers to use data analysis for making future investment decisions on selling, buying and constructing real estate.""  The effort is one of the more high-profile public sector blockchain initiatives to emerge in recent weeks, coming on the heels of news that the Port of Rotterdam, Europe’s largest shipping port, has been testing applications of its own.  It also comes amid a digital modernization effort being undertaken by both the national government in the Netherlands as well as municipal-level constituencies throughout the region.

42379058,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mrAJ,1481547604,Why Circle's Bitcoin 'Pivot' Isn't What it Seems,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and a member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.  As you've likely heard, Circle announced this week that it had closed down its bitcoin exchange, a move the mainstream press interpreted as a ""surprising"" pivot away from bitcoin and another nail in the cryptocurrency’s coffin.  The reaction is understandable, given Circle's significance in the bitcoin space.  But it is wrong, on many levels:  It is not a surprise.  Nor is it a pivot.  It is not a rejection of bitcoin.  Nor is it bad news for the sector.  Let's go through these points in order, and then take a look at the trend this news highlights.  Retracing steps  The move is not unexpected: Circle has for some time been signalling its intention to focus on payments. When the company’s first consumer products were revealed in March 2014, the emphasis was already on ""deposits and withdrawals"" rather than ""buy and sell"".  As early as May 2014, the company was downplaying bitcoin, calling itself ""an Internet-based consumer finance company"".  For the same reason, it’s not a pivot. It is true that the company was “born” on bitcoin, but even at the time of its launch in October 2013, CEO and co-founder Jeremy Allaire recognized that standards would evolve and that bitcoin might not end up being the main digital currency.  In other words, even at the beginning, Circle was cryptocurrency agnostic, only at the time bitcoin was the only significant one around.  As far back as November 2014, Allaire told CoinDesk that the focus was less about bitcoin than about how people use money. The latest news is merely the confirmation of a strategy initiated some time ago.  Why not the how  Circle has not ""pulled the plug"" on bitcoin, as many have reported.  Users can still store it in their Circle account and send it to others. Bitcoin will continue to be a settlement token and Spark, the new protocol unveiled this week, is partly based on the bitcoin system.  What Circle has done is communicate a conviction that bitcoin will not be a significant form of payment in the near future.  While it may be a disappointment for bitcoin fans, this does not deal the sector an unexpected blow. Frustration with the slow evolution is spreading. Nevertheless, the price has been increasing. Innovation on variations of the protocol continues. And progress is being made on scaling solutions, sidechains and much more.  Bitcoin may be stuck. But it is not dead.  Looking at the bigger picture, Circle’s decision highlights a quiet but fundamental trend: the focus on applications rather than mechanics.  While bitcoin, ethereum, Corda and many other protocols continue to make noise, the real action is happening elsewhere.  Startups like Circle are putting blockchain efficiencies directly in users’ hands. The technology is important, but users are generally more interested in what the protocols can do.  The why has a potentially greater impact than the how, and appealing applications (rather than technicalities) will give blockchains the mainstream acceptance they need to kickstart widespread implementation.  So, the main news in this development isn’t that Circle is stopping a service that was never a main feature. It’s that functionalities have improved, and more people than ever will have access to what this progress can offer.

42379053,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mr5H,1481542805,What We Know About the Federal Reserve's Blockchain Stance,"On 5th December, the Federal Reserve released its much-awaited research paper on distributed ledgers.  The paper, “Distributed Ledger Technology in Payments, Clearing and Settlement"", came two months after Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard remarked at the Institute of International Finance that the US central bank was ""paying close attention"" to the technology.  The product of the input of 30 financial industry stakeholders, including government officials, experts from traditional finance and FinTech institutions and members of the industry consortia – the paper explored the possibilities of distributed ledger integration in the financial industry, including the legal and governance challenges facing the development of any future proofs-of-concept.  As stated in the paper:  ""As part of its core objective to foster the safety and efficiency of the payment system and to promote financial stability, the Federal Reserve has a public policy interest in understanding and monitoring the development of innovations that could affect the structural design and functioning of financial markets.”  'Significant implications'  Some may argue, however, that the publication of this paper is not necessarily the call of action anticipated following Brainard’s speech and Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen’s remarks before the House of Representatives’ Financial Services Committee.  Yellen said that blockchain technology “could have very significant implications for the payments system” and that the Fed wants “to foster innovation”.  The perception for some is that the Fed may be playing its cards close to the chest in regards to holding off on proposing definitive action and recommendations regarding distributed ledger innovation or – worse – may not have a hand to play at all.  ""I do not think this report is particularly significant,"" said David Yermack, chair of the Finance Department at New York University’s Leonard N Stern School of Business, to CoinDesk.  The ""very general introduction to the structure of payment systems and the potential uses of distributed ledgers"", he continued, ""barely mentions any role for the government, other than the need to consider whether new regulations will be required to fit the potential uses of the technology.""  ""I think the report is a useful reference but hardly a roadmap for how the industry might evolve,” Yermack added.  International frictions  A key consideration in the paper is the question of the payments, clearing and settlement regarding cross-border transactions. The current mechanism for transferring funds across international borders is a series of bank-to-bank credit or debit transactions, with varying fees being applied by each bank along the series.  With banks not necessarily responding to messages from creditors promptly, settlement for cross-border payments could take as long as five days.  The paper suggests that distributed ledgers can help to alleviate the friction caused by the credit chain, with the possibility of an open-source interoperability standard like the Interledger Protocol (ILP) spurring adoption of blockchains for international payments.  There is also the hope that the use of distributed ledgers can help combat the problem of increasing numbers of fraudulent cross-border transactions.  In one case, $81m was stolen from the Central Bank of Bangladesh through false payment requests connected to various Filipino casinos.  The theft – the largest of a series of bank-level intrusion into the SWIFT network, the world’s largest interbank messaging service – illustrated a very uneasy truth about cross-border payments: there is no known way to secure them using current techniques and methods.  Real-time auditing  While the banks victimized in these thefts all shared deficiencies in their local security, the notion that these thefts can occur unchallenged raises serious concerns about the creditworthiness and stability of the system as a whole.  The paper takes the position that a distributed ledger – by making transaction histories and current states of ownership of assets readily available across all nodes of the network – can quickly make real-time auditing possible at a peer level, improving the transparency and security of the nodes.  “DLT is essentially asset-agnostic, meaning the technology is potentially capable of providing the storage, recordkeeping, and transfer of any type of asset,” reads the research paper. “This asset-agnostic nature of DLT has resulted in a range of possible applications currently being explored for uses in post-trade processes.”  Not everyone, however, is convinced that distributed ledgers can alleviate the friction caused by cross-border payments.  “My thought on this is that they’re trying to fit a square peg in a round hole,” Spencer Bogart, research analyst for equity research with Needham & Company, told CoinDesk.  “By digging in to explore how ‘blockchain’ or ‘DLT’ might improve efficiency in PCS systems that they may uncover some real inefficiencies that can be addressed — but I highly doubt that ‘blockchain’ or ‘DLT’ is the solution,” he said.  The ""critical elements"" needed for a blockchain to function (such as proof-of-work security, decentralization and immutability) are not ""desirable features for these systems"", Bogart suggested, adding:  ""In the process of exploration, they may find that their database technology is out of date and could be improved and, if so, that’s all fine and should certainly be embraced but it’s standard progress — it’s not the sexy, cutting-edge, mass-efficiency producing technology that people get excited about.”  Understanding the Fed’s motivation  This, of course, is not a position shared by all. Ryan Zagone is the director or regulatory relations at Ripple, which facilitated the development of the Interledger Protocol.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Zagone pointed out that the research paper could be the first step in the formation of a guidance position the Fed could take to help lead innovation in cross-border payments.  “By taking a moment to assess the implications of using this technology – both in the sense of what we can achieve, but also what are the risks and realities of using this technology for our payments – this paper presents a thoughtful look at the state of the cross-border payment system,” Zagone said.  “There are real inefficiencies with cross-border payments and there is – as the Fed has pointed out – room to improve domestic systems,” he continued. “So, this is a broad look toward what is needed to improve the system today.”  Calls for improvements  Ripple is a member of the Federal Reserve’s Faster Payments Task Force, which is charged with finding solutions for the agenda laid out in the 2015 position paper “Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System.”  Contained within its agenda are calls for implementation of faster, safer payment capabilities in the US, reduction of fraud and security risks to the payment system, improvement in end-to-end efficiency for cross-border and domestic payments, and enhancement of the National Settlement Service and interbank settlement for check payments.  Composed of stakeholders from government agencies, major financial and retail operations and affiliated non-profit entities, the task force represents the Federal Reserve’s commitment to promote change to the payment system from within the private sphere.  “The Federal Reserve will act as leader, convener and catalyst as appropriate and will commit its resources to supporting these initiatives,” the task force paper reads. “... It would not consider expanding its service provider role unless it determines that doing so is necessary to bring about significant improvements to the payment system and that actions of the private sector alone will likely not achieve the desired outcomes for speed, efficiency and safety in a timely manner.”  Ripple’s Interledger Protocol permits blockchains to automatically route and deliver messages and payments between each other without the need of complicated coding.  The potential of this is that two accounts on different distributed ledgers can connect to each other without the need to vet the connection first.  As the transmitted payment is secured using a ledger-provided escrow, this eliminates the need of a third-party ledger, ensures the receipt of either a cryptographically-signed receipt or the rejected escrow to the sender and removes the need for any mutually-agreed transfer arrangement.  While it can be debated ad nauseam whether the Fed is doing enough to deliver on its promise of promoting innovation of blockchain technology or even if such technology could effectively be implemented wide-scale, the paper – taken with other blockchain innovation measures taken recently, such as the creation of the Illinois Blockchain Initiative – suggests an evolution in the conversation of cryptographic-enabled finances from the theoretical to the concrete.  ""This working paper presents as a rigorously researched, lucid, thorough, and comprehensive place to begin in the development of a guiding document for the future,” said Perianne Boring, president and founder of The Chamber of Digital Commerce, in conversation with CoinDesk.  She said:  “This paper certainly could signal a move toward a national policy to encourage incorporation of blockchain technologies.""
