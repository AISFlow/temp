42382277,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r5Dh,1562190312,"ZenGo Introduces Non-Custodial, Keyless Competitor to Calibra Wallet","When David Marcus said that he expected many Libra-supporting wallets to come to market to compete with Calibra, perhaps he wasn’t expecting such a quick response.  The developers at ZenGo, an Israeli startup that recently released a keyless, non-custodial retail wallet, just published open source code for Libra’s first non-custodial wallet, just two weeks after Facebook’s announcement.  This is the first alternative to the Calibra wallet, a proposed custodial wallet that will maintain oversight of user’s funds. A Facebook subsidiary of the same name will develop the Calibra wallet and other financial services for the Libra currency.  ZenGo’s product – currently available only on the Libra testnet, without a user interface – will instead ensure complete user control over funds. Additionally, by drawing on a Threshold Signatures Scheme (TSS), the wallet will be keyless.  In a note published today on Facebook, Marcus attempted to respond to some of the criticism Libra has seen. He said, “You’ll be able to use a range of custodial and non-custodial wallets that will have full interoperability with one another, meaning you’ll be able to pay and receive payments across wallets from different companies, or use a software wallet you’d operate on your own.”  To some extent, ZenGo's announcement confirms this claim. Though Marcus also said, ""Facebook won’t have any special responsibility over the Libra Network. But we hope that people will respond favorably to the Calibra wallet.""    Splitting the Atom    Threshold signatures are a sub-domain of multi-party computation, which addresses key management issues by creating a modular lock that allows for several different non-trusting computers to anonymously bring together individual fragments of a complete key.  Instead of having users maintain control over their private key (an extreme reaction against custodianship), which opens up the potential for loss or theft, ZenGo acts as a co-signer with the user, bringing together constituent parts of a fully secured cryptographic key.  TSS maintains user’s authority because transactions can only be initiated by the user, and can never be modified by the co-signer.  “The idea here is to offload the burden of key management from the user. If Libra is going to become a widely adopted coin there is no way a mainstream audience will know how to deal with back-up and key recovery, or even multi signature set up,” said ZenGo CEO Ouriel Ohayon. “By providing a TSS based wallet users will enjoy a custodian grade experience but without the complexities of Self Custodian Wallet.”  While it has not been released yet, the Calibra wallet will likely be password protected, subject to strict KYC regulations, and subject to Facebook’s proprietary orders. For now the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has ruled non-custodial wallets do not qualify as money services businesses and therefore do not require KYC protocols.  The wallet will be integrated into ZenGo’s existing platform and will be capable of holding multiple assets. Ohayon also said it will support ""t out of n"" co-signers to further decentralize key ownership and increase wallet security.  Speaking to the quick turnaround, Ohayon said ZenGo spent a lot of time making their TSS compatible and reusable for different kinds of blockchains, including ether and bitcoin, and that it was “pretty trivial” to build support for the edDSA elliptic curve Libra runs on.  “Libra code is extremely sophisticated and well documented… Of course there are limitations and some unknown imperfections. They will have to strive for more decentralization and more privacy. We believe this will be possible to contribute in that direction. That’s why we chose to build from day one on it,” Ohayon said.

42382282,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r5Ij,1562182242,"Coinsquare, Just Cash Partnership Enables Non-Bank ATM Crypto Transactions","Coinsquare  , a Canadian cryptocurrency trading platform, announced it has bought an eight figure controlling stake in fintech software producer, Just Cash. The acquisition will enable the firm to introduce crypto transactions on traditional, non-bank ATMs in the United States.  Just Cash developed a software to retrofit ATMs to sell cryptocurrencies via a customer’s debit card without having to upgrade the machine’s hardware.  Coinsquare CEO Cole Diamond confirmed that the technology has already been introduced to some ATM machines, a process that will continue until the end of next year.  There are approximately 250,000 non-bank ATMs that can potentially be upgraded with this feature. By partnering with two of the three major producers of non-bank automated teller machines – Nautilus Hyosung, Triton, and Genmega, though he was unable to disclose which ones – Diamond said Coinsquare expects to integrate with approximately 170 thousand machines across nearly all 50 states.  “We will outnumber the total number bitcoin ATMs within a year,” Diamond said.  Users will be able to buy and transact with bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether, dash, litecoin, stellar, ripple, doge, among others directly through their bank accounts.  The machine will then offer a printed receipt that shows the user’s private and public keys, “effectively your paper wallet,” Diamond said.  The company’s roadmap includes a full US expansion in 2020, with the ATMs serving as an entry point. Just Cash’s software will “piggyback on the regulatory efforts” Coinsquare has pulled through in anticipation of this market entry.  Diamond hopes the ATMs serve as an efficient on-ramp to the crypto-uninitiated.  “Right now, there is a lack of mainstream cryptocurrency adoption because most people are intimidated by the process to acquire it,” he said in a statement.  Diamond also said this feature will “bridge the gap” between traditional banking and the crypto industry, though he does not expect to integrate the software with bank partners soon.  “One, we need to believe [banks] want to use it… Banks have been hesitant to get involved [in anything crypto,]” he said, adding bank ATMs require the development of additional software upgrades, as each entity runs proprietary software.  The merged firms will operate under the Coinsquare brand, though Just Cash will maintain a degree of autonomy.

42382293,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r569,1562175315,Facebook's David Marcus: Libra Crypto Users Won't Have to Trust Us,"Facebook's David Marcus is pushing back against concerns about the social media giant's new cryptocurrency project, Libra.  In a note published Wednesday on Facebook, Marcus addressed ""a number of questions and a few misunderstandings"" about the project.  The social media giant's blockchain lead also confirmed he would be testifying before both the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee on the project later this month.  In Wednesday's post, Marcus sought to address a number of issues that have been raised by lawmakers and informed observers alike, including whether Libra is actually decentralized, why there isn't a charter in place for the Libra Association and whether Libra can actually address financial inclusion.  Perhaps most notably, he addressed the widespread distrust of Facebook in the wake of Cambridge Analytica, 2016 election interference and other high-profile mishaps.  ""Bottom line: You won’t have to trust Facebook to get the benefit of Libra,"" Marcus wrote, adding:  ""And Facebook won’t have any special responsibility over the Libra Network. But we hope that people will respond favorably to the Calibra wallet [made by Facebook]. We’ve been clear about our approach to financial data separation and we will live up to our commitments and work hard to deliver real utility.""  Facebook published a white paper and supporting documentation for Libra last month, but was immediately met with pushback from regulators worldwide.  Under various subheadings, Marcus addressed complaints about the project, including concerns that Libra would not be able to bank individuals who are currently under- or unbanked, as well as concerns about Facebook's track record on consumer data protection.  ""Someone wrote that the key reason people are unbanked is that they don’t have enough money to actually be banked, and claimed Libra wouldn’t solve this,"" Marcus wrote, calling this explanation misguided.  In his view, Libra would lower the drawbridges to financial services for anyone with “a $40 smartphone and connectivity.”  Marcus also repeated a claim from the Calibra subsidiary's public documentation in noting that Facebook would not have access to any financial data from the wallet provider.  ""People will have many ways in which to use Libra and access the network,"" he said. ""You’ll be able to use a range of custodial and non-custodial wallets that will have full interoperability with one another, meaning you’ll be able to pay and receive payments across wallets from different companies, or use a software wallet you’d operate on your own.""  The company's profit model for Libra would come from any commerce that occurs across its family of apps by ensuring that ads are more effective and advertisers are more motivated to buy space on Facebook's platforms, he said.  ""We are looking forward to continuing to engage with the various communities and stakeholders. We want to hear your feedback, and we are committed to taking the time to get this right,"" Marcus said in his conclusion.  Decentralized token  While Libra will be controlled by a small number of entities at launch, it will gradually decentralize over time, he said.  Facebook, which is one of 28 founding members for the Libra Association – the governing association which will be responsible for overseeing the Libra network after it launches – will ultimately have the same amount of power over the network that its other launch associates will have, Marcus said.  ""It’s easy to assume from the headlines that Libra is only associated with Facebook, but that is not the case,"" Marcus wrote, adding:  ""But it was important to start with trusted entities that could operate in a regulated environment and with the operational expertise required to ensure the integrity of the network in its foundational stage. I’d argue that one hundred geographically distributed, industry-diverse organizations is quite decentralized. ... As a comparison, often the concentration of power in the hands of those running software for mining pools on other blockchains is overlooked.""  ""But there’s no question that there are more decentralized blockchains available, and that the Libra Association must strive to gradually decentralize it further,"" he said.  Each of the founding members will be a part of setting up the Libra Association's governance rules and ""other key decisions,"" as part of an effort to limit the amount of power Facebook has over the network, he claimed.

Bloomberg  reported from the event, saying that Roubini argued that cryptocurrencies were bunk, ""deriding its technology, security and lack of convenience."" Hayes agreed that there were some bad actors but that his goal was to allow users to speculate on financial products.  “People love to speculate,” he said. “We’re just trying to give them an opportunity to do it in a safe manner.”  Hayes posted this response to the call to ""release the tapes"" and Crypto-Twitter asked for a more serious response. None seems forthcoming.  That said, given that the average financial conference probably doesn't have economists calling each other ""Cosa Nostra Coward Mafia Thugs"" at least we can at least argue that online crypto beefs are pretty lively. We've reached out to both parties for comment and will report more when and if the ""tapes"" surface.

42382285,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r5MV,1562162412,Blockstream Launches Atomic Swaps on Liquid Bitcoin Sidechain,"Blockstream has created an ""experimental"" tool that makes it easier for users to trade ""trustlessly"" between tokens launched on its Liquid sidechain.  Dubbed Liquid Swap Tool, the platform uses ""atomic swaps,"" a cryptographic technology that already serves as backbone for newer decentralized exchanges currently in development.  The motivation for these types of transactions is that today most exchanges are middlemen trusted by users to exchange cryptocurrency on their behalf. Many have lost funds or suffered hacks over the years, leading technologists to argue they really can't be trusted with this money. Atomic swaps offer an alternative.  As mentioned above, this atomic swap tool is specifically geared for tokens launched on Liquid, a sidechain that's pegged to bitcoin. To use it, users must send their tokens to the sidechain, effectively trading their bitcoin for ""L-BTC."" It's kind of like alchemy: morphing bitcoin into an altered type of bitcoin, which is faster and has more privacy features, but requires more trust in the intermediaries that run the sidechain.  Recently, Blockstream launched a tool for launching security tokens on top of the so-called ""sidechain,"" which is pegged to the bitcoin network.  With the new Liquid Swap Tool, users will be able to trade one of these tokens for another without requiring an intermediary to do the exchange.  Though, it's worth noting the instructions for the tool are pretty technical for now. Users need to download Liquid, fiddle with a configuration file, download the separate swapping tool and perform the instructions in the code repository to get it going.  Not to mention, the repository describes the tool as ""early days,"" arguing it ""should be considered experimental,"" going on to outline a way to make such a trade more private.  ""It is recommended to use the tool with someone that you can trust to keep such data private. Users are also encouraged to encrypt/sign messages sent with their trading partners in order to mitigate against man-in-the-middle attacks,"" the description continues.

More than 2,960 accounts have traded CME Group’s bitcoin (BTC) futures across all client types and time zones since launch, according to new data from the derivatives marketplace. In 2019 alone, there has been more than 950 new accounts created, marking a 30 percent increase in total client sign-ups, CoinDesk has learned.  In addition, the number of large open interest holders, entities that hold contracts worth at least 25 BTC (worth $280,000 at press time) grew to 49, up from an average of 46 during the last week of June, a new record.  Also of note, open interest is up in all four expiries, meaning CME Group ""is creating a forward curve for the crypto markets so that investors can better manage price,"" according to a company spokesperson.  Bitcoin futures daily open interest  As shown in the chart above, open interest in CME's BTC futures has been steadily on the rise, up to a record-breaking 6,069 contracts toward the end of June and demonstrating a strong demand. (Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled, and thus, are open).  It could be a sign that the traditional finance industry is taking a greater interest in crypto, says Gareth MacLeod, partner at Gryphon Labs, an open-source framework for algorithmic trading in cryptocurrency markets.  He told CoinDesk:  “It's most likely traders in the traditional finance industry using CME to take a long position off of news about Libra.”  Given traditional finance’s apprehension toward crypto, mainly due to its wild price swings, futures contracts offer stability, reliability, and reduce risk when it comes to operating large portfolios.  Professional traders and larger financial institutions also prefer to operate through a familiar platform, rather than through a traditional crypto exchange due to interoperability and familiarity with their own Bloomberg terminals, says McCleod.  The news is welcomed at a time when BTC’s wild price fluctuations are on full display, first rising to a peak of $13,888 on June 26 before falling sharply to $9,650 on July 2.  BTC has since bounced back, up 15.85 percent over a 24-hour period and was last seen changing hands at $11,420.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.

42382272,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r59v,1562158820,Casa Launches Lightning Node Mobile App for Bitcoin Newbies,"Casa  ’s new mobile app makes it easier to manage your lightning node on the go.  Launched today, the new Sats App works like a noncustodial wallet with some unique features. In addition to being able to manage a user’s lightning node from the mobile app, Casa CEO Jeremy Welch said the startup will soon roll out a rewards program for earning small amounts of bitcoin through the app.  The goal is to help crypto newbies graduate from earning their first bitcoin all the way to managing a lightning node with just one mobile app.  “Features are focused on increasing adoption of bitcoin and lightning nodes,” Welch told CoinDesk in an exclusive interview. “You will be able to earn bitcoin if you don’t have a Casa node, but you will be able to earn bitcoin faster if you have a node.”  Stepping back, the bitcoin security startup has launched several products since last September, including protective faraday bags and the Casa lightning node device. Welch said the startup has raised more than $3.5 million so far from investors such as Alyse Killeen, Castle Island Ventures, Boost VC and Compound, just to name a few.  The staff of roughly 25 people serves customers in 60 countries running “thousands of active nodes,” Welch said. Those customers will have first access to the new app this week, with public access via the app store rolling out later this month.  “It’s a lightweight app, but allows you to experience the full gamut – from earning your first sats to operating a full node from your phone,” Welch said. “It’s private, secure and connects over Tor.”  Casa already has a multisig custody app for tech-savvy customers who want to protect significant amounts of bitcoin, called Keymaster. This new mobile app was created for onboarding the crypto-curious. The rewards program will give tiny fractions of a bitcoin called Satoshis. One bitcoin is made up of 100 million Satoshis.  ""Our first announced SatsBack reward will be 20,000 satoshis just to get your Casa Node all connected up on Tor and connected to Sats App,"" Welch said.  His team's goal – with crypto rewards and other user-friendly features – is to provide users with easy ways to hold their own bitcoin, rather than keeping it on exchanges. Welch added:  “We’re trying to make it easier for people to do that, self-custody.”  App image courtesy of Casa",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/07/03/casa-launches-lightning-node-mobile-app-for-bitcoin-newbies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/86fc3842410697d803b3cbbae2c30b4ed4433f19-1500x757.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382278,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r5Ex,1562157336,'Moderation Bot' Blacklists Telegram Users to Tackle Crypto Scams,"Blockchain advisory firm AmaZix is opening up access to its ""moderation bot"" to help stamp out cryptocurrency scams on popular messaging app Telegram.  Using the bot, the company has built up a blacklist of Telegram users based on data collected over two years. So far, the list contains over 50,000 banned users, according to a press release emailed to CoinDesk.  The database of dubious actors was developed through the moderation of groups on Telegram. From over 140 groups, AmaZix said it has seen over 730,000 Telegram users, of which over 54,500 (7.5 percent) were banned for apparently attempting some form of crypto scam.  These include impersonating admins and direct messaging users, posting fake offers or giveaways, posting links for cloned social media or other websites, and phishing group users in attempts to steal private keys.  AmaZix CEO Jonas Karlberg explained how the system works in the release, saying:  “Through our service, which takes the form of a bot that is added to a group, we offer free, real-time threat intelligence for Telegram. As soon as a user posts malicious content on any of the groups we monitor, they are automatically banned from all our groups, and added to our global blacklist.""  All of the groups moderated by AmaZixhttps://www.amazix.com/moderation-bot have had some scam activity, said Karlberg. ""As soon as a project gets traction, the scammers move in. Telegram offers the criminals complete anonymity, so they use it with absolutely no fear of reprisals.""  The company's chief operating officer, Dejan Horvat, told CoinDesk that the service works in English only for now, but said many of its features do not require language. For example, forwarding links or accounts is banned.  ""If someone forwards spam, regardless of the language, then the bot will act on it. The only feature where language is important is the curse list where the bot deletes many curse words,"" he said.  Horvat added that, if a telegram user is wrongly blacklisted, they can report it to the team, ""who will then investigate the situation and remove you from the blacklist if appropriate.""  The blacklist is administered in ""real-time"" 24-hours a day by the firm's channel moderators, according to the release. AmaZix has no formal relationship with Telegram currently, according to Horvat.  Karlberg concluded:  “Our hope is, by opening access and encouraging more people to use and contribute to our service, we will catch the scammers even more quickly. This will effectively discourage malicious activity on Telegram.”  Telegram image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | SPONSORED,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/07/03/moderation-bot-blacklists-telegram-users-to-tackle-crypto-scams,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/be078364476be38d6c21848f4f6f6168c0c38679-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin could fall back to $9,600 if prices fail to hold above $10,830 in the next 24 hours, validating the bearish crossover of the 5- and 10-day moving averages.      Bitcoin (BTC) has risen sharply in the last 24 hours, but a key price hurdle must still be passed to confirm a bull revival.  The premier cryptocurrency by market value was on the defensive in the early European trading hours on Tuesday, having breached support at $10,300 on the back of high volumes.  The ensuing sell-off, however, was cut short near $9,614 and prices rose back above $10,300 in the U.S. session, confirming a bullish double-bottom breakout. The price jumped to $10,700 following the breakout, as expected, and extended gains further to hit a high of $11,575 on Bitstamp earlier today.  With the $2,000 rally, bitcoin has established a base or technical support around $9,600. The quick recovery could also be considered a sign of strong demand below the psychological level of $10,000.  However, it is still too early to call a retest of the recent high of $13,880, as the cryptocurrency is yet to invalidate the most basic of all bearish patterns – a lower high. For that, the price needs to rise above the June 28 high of $12,448.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $11,350 on Bitstamp, representing 11 percent gains on a 24-hour basis.  Hourly and weekly charts  A high-volume break above the bearish lower high of $13,880 (above left) would confirm an end of the price pullback and open the doors to a retest of, and possibly a break above, the recent high of $13,880.  Traders may argue that the cryptocurrency has already breached the falling channel – a sign of bullish reversal.  While that's true, the breakout wasn't backed by a surge in buy volume (green bars). Further, sell volumes have been higher than buy volumes post-breakout – a trend that has been in place ever since bitcoin topped out at $13,800. That puts a question mark on the sustainability of gains above $11,000.  And widely followed long-term technical indicators like the 14-week relative strength index (RSI) continue to report overbought conditions with an above-70 reading. In such situations, price breakouts on the hourly and other shorter-duration charts often end up trapping the bulls on the wrong side of the market.  Hence, it's likely safer to wait for stronger confirmation of a bull revival in the form of a break above $12,448.  Daily chart  BTC created a bullish hammer candle on Tuesday, comprising of a long lower wick – a sign of dip demand or rejection of lower prices – and a small body (the gap between open and close).  The hammer pattern is widely considered a sign of bullish reversal. The candle's success rate, however, is higher when it appears after a prolonged downtrend, which isn't the case here. Nevertheless, the candle does indicate that $9,614 is now the level to beat for bears.  That level could come into play if prices drop below $10,830 (today's low), reinforcing the bearish view put forward by the cross of the 5-day moving average below the 10-day average.

42382283,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r5LF,1562148274,UK Finance Watchdog Takes Step Toward Ban on Crypto Derivatives,"A U.K. financial regulator is planning to outlaw cryptocurrency-based derivatives in a bid to protect investors from financial harm.  In a press release published Wednesday, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it is consulting over an outright ban on the ""sale, marketing and distribution to all retail consumers"" of derivatives such as CFDs, options and futures, as well as exchange-traded notes (ETNs) linked to ""unregulated transferable cryptoassets"" by firms operating or based in the U.K.  The FCA said it believes such financial products are ""ill-suited"" to retail investors ""who cannot reliably assess the value and risks of derivatives or ETNs that reference certain cryptoassets.""  The regulator bases that judgment on various factors, including that the underlying crypto assets have ""no reliable basis for valuation,"" the prevalence of ""market abuse and financial crime"" in the secondary market for such assets, ""extreme"" volatility in the crypto markets, and a lack of understanding by retail investors. The FCA further says there is no ""clear investment need"" for financial products referencing crypto assets.  The authority said in the release:  ""We estimate the potential benefit to retail consumers from banning these products to be in a range from £75 million to £234.3 million a year.""  Christopher Woolard, Executive Director of Strategy & Competition at the FCA, said:  ""As with our work on the wider CFD and binary options markets, we will act when we see poor products being sold to retail consumers. These are complex contracts built on top of complex assets.""  A plan to consult on a ban of crypto derivatives was previously announced by the FCA last November.  Christopher Woolard, executive board member and director of strategy and competition at the FCA, said at the time that the watchdog has concerns that retail investors are being sold “complex, volatile and often leveraged derivatives products” based on cryptocurrencies with “underlying market integrity issues.”  On Monday, the FCA also announced in a policy document that it has finalized rules restricting the sale of CFDs and CFD-like options to retail clients. The rules include mandated leverage limits of 2:1 on CFDs that reference cryptocurrencies.  The FCA said that it also expects to publish its final ""Guidance on Cryptoassets"" later this summer after a period reviewing which crypto assets fall under its purview.

42382306,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r2hh,1562144424,Now Japanese Regulators Are Getting Anxious About Facebook's Cryptocurrency,"Japan's central bank has joined the regulators worldwide expressing concerns over the potential risks posed by Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency project.  A report from Nikkei Asian Review on Wednesday indicates that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) has concerns that Libra – a planned cryptocurrency backed by a basket of fiat currencies and government securities – will be tough to regulate and could bring risk to the financial system.  Nikkei cited as unnamed official from the BoJ as recently saying:  ""It will move money into an absolutely virtual world, so it is completely different than other forms of digital payment.""  The report suggests that by linking Libra to more than one national currency, Facebook may be trying to avoid undue control from any single nation's regulators.  The Bank of Japan's governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, has said he intends to ""keep careful watch"" on whether cryptocurrencies could become generally adopted as a means of payment, and how existing financial and payment systems might be affected.  The report further posits that, as Libra users withdraw money to buy the token from regional banks, Facebook would likely place those reserve funds in Japan's larger banks, resulting in a flow away from more minor institutions.  A hike in demand for government securities as a result of Libra could also see interest rates drop, said Nikkei, suggesting that both of those factors could harm Japan's financial stability.  A BoJ official has further suggested that Facebook's crypto project would be ""piggybacking for free on a financial system that takes heavy costs."" Effectively, the firm would be running Libra using financial institutions that must spend large amounts on merely remaining complaint with watchdog rules.  Over in the U.S., similar fears have prompted lawmakers to call for Facebook to freeze the project until it can be properly assessed.  Democrats from the U.S. House of Representatives wrote an open letter to Facebook on Tuesday, describing concerns with Facebook’s track record, a well as the potential for libra to act as a new global currency system.  “It appears that these products may lend themselves to an entirely new global financial system that is based out of Switzerland and intended to rival U.S. monetary policy and the dollar. This raises serious privacy, trading, national security, and monetary policy concerns for not only Facebook’s over 2 billion users, but also for investors, consumers, and the broader global economy,” the lawmakers wrote.  Regulators in France, the U.K. and other nations including Singapore have also raised concerns over the Libra project.

According to a report from SBS-AAP, the country's Communist government announced on state-run TV that it would potentially use crypto as part of a package aimed to boost incomes for as much as a quarter of Cubans and assist with market reforms.  The move is possibly influenced by the nation's ally, Venezuela, which launched its own ""petro"" cryptocurrency early last year. It's not clear from the report if Cuba might launch its own token or use existing alternatives.  Like Venezuela, Cuba is suffering from tough U.S.-led sanctions and has also seen a drop-off in aid from Venezuela which is undergoing both financial and political crises of its own.  In the TV announcement, Cuba's President Miguel Diaz-Canel indicted that the cryptocurrency plan is aimed to raise national production and demand in order to boost growth.  The package would reportedly boost some pensions and wages for employees within public administration, social services and state-run media, almost doubling their average monthly wage.  If so, the state appears to be placing a lot of hope in its crypto dreams. Venezuela has not seen its petro token take off internationally, despite having touted it at OPEC as a means for the world to pay for oil.  Soon after launch, U.S. President Donald Trump also added the petro to its list of sanctioned assets.  Companies assisting the project in avoiding sanctions could also get in hot water. A Russian bank was itself sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury after it was considered to have assisted financing of the petro.

First to be included in the wallet from Tuesday are Maker (MKR), Basic Attention Token (BAT), OmiseGO (OMG), with the others to follow in the ""near future,"" according to a press release emailed to CoinDesk. ERC-20 is a technical standard that sets rules for tokens launched on ethereum or related blockchains.  Doron Rosenblum, managing director of eToroX, said:  “Adding 120 ERC-20 tokens to the eToro wallet is further evidence of our belief that one day all investable assets will be tokenized. One of the main barriers to mass adoption of cryptoassets is lack of access. Making these first 5 tokens available enables more people to transfer and hold them into a secure and regulated wallet.”  Within the US, the wallet is managed by eToro US LLC. eToroX also launched a cryptocurrency exchange and eight eToro-branded stablecoins back in April.  eToro CEO and co-founder, Yoni Assia, said at the time:  “Just as eToro has opened up traditional markets for investors, we want to do the same in the tokenized world. […] Blockchain will eventually ‘eat’ traditional financial services through tokenization.”  Parent firm eToro itself launched a cryptocurrency buying and selling platform and wallet service in the U.S. in February, having first dived into the crypto space with the launch of bitcoin trading on its platform back in 2014.  eToro image by Marco Verch, via Creative Commons",POSITIVE,BAT,BAT | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SPONSORED | TRADING,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/07/03/etoro-adds-first-ethereum-tokens-to-its-wallet-120-of-them,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2ea6631534772ae8a68c4ab1e2a2d5ae6c900b5f-2560x1655.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
