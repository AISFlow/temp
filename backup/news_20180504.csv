42380649,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yeqb,1525471206,"When Not If: For Ethereum Believers, Scaling Is Just a Matter of Time","""Sleep? What's this word you talk about?""  It's safe to say ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin's joke during the first day of EDCON, an ethereum developer conference now taking place in Toronto, had some truth to it, both for himself and the developers who took the stage with him to discuss one of the $76 billion blockchain's toughest challenges: scaling.  In contrast to the day's more cheery asides, the discussion, featuring Vlad Zamfir, Philip Daian, Joseph Poon, Karl Floersch, Hsiao-Wei Wang and Justin Drake, struck a comparatively restrained note, one that was perhaps sobered by the sheer weight of the scaling challenges ahead.  These challenges were on full display six months ago when the platform was brought almost to a halt by the viral popularity of CryptoKitties, a decentralized application for trading digital kittens. More recently, though, even Buterin acknowledged the issue at an event in Seoul, South Korea, saying app developers were ""screwed"" because of the protocol's current scale.  However, it was a point noted prominently at EDCON as well, with Zamfir, the developer behind ethereum's upcoming consensus algorithm change, giving another prominent voice to the doubts.  Zamfir told attendees:  “I still don't know how scalable it can get. I don't know, I can't even quantify the possible scalability of the blockchain, really.""  That said, there's one thing in the platform's favor, and that might be the sheer number of potential solutions to the scalability hurdle, a list that now includes Raiden, Plasma, Liquidity Network, Loom Network, OmiseGO, sharding, state channels and perhaps even others now in the earliest stages of experimentation.  Still, the developers assembled were realistic, noting that there's still a lot of R&D that needs to be done before ethereum can scale to allow for its vision of creating a decentralized world computer.  “What keeps me up at night is that not that many people know how to solve it,” said Floersch, a crypto-economics researcher who works on scaling solution Plasma.  So many solutions  Still, that's not to say that understanding of the challenge isn't increasing. For instance, it's now accepted that there are two categories of scaling solutions.  This includes layer-one technologies, like sharding, that necessitate changes to the ethereum blockchain itself, and ""layer-two"" technologies, which can be built independently and added to the blockchain without an underlying change.  All these solutions are being pursued at the same time, and while that might seem to add complexity and confusion, according to Buterin, it's both the safest and most impactful way to get a solution ready for the network. By actively pursuing all ideas, he said, even if one scaling solution doesn’t work, there’s always a backup.  And if they all work, the ideas can be combined to make something even better.  “For every single problem, multiple solutions exist,” Buterin said, adding:  “If for some reason the trolls are right and sharding gets delayed by five years then guess what, next year we still have awesome state channel networks and we still have raiden and we still have liquidity and whatever else is being built.""  Poon, the co-author of the paper on the plasma scaling solution (and also bitcoin's lightning network paper), echoed this point, adding that in striving towards the same goal, developers can make discoveries that might be useful for other scaling approaches as well.  “It doesn't matter what wins, so to speak, because they all do similar things and they all achieve things in somewhat similar ways,” Poon said.  Yet, there wasn't unanimous agreement on that topic.  Zamfir, for instance, warned that the multiple layer-two solutions - or those stacked on top of ethereum - could increase the incentive for bad actors to attack the underlying blockchain.  “I don’t think the security of these things is independent, in fact, I worry that layer-one solutions will be compromised by layer-two solutions,” he said during the panel.  However, Zamfir acknowledged that this experimentation on layer-two technologies is necessary in case there’s no conclusion on how to make changes to the blockchain at all.  Touching on another hot topic for the ethereum community, Zamfir said, “I do think that we should experiment with things on layer-two, just in case layer-one governance breaks down and we can't do anything with layer one.”  When will it happen?  With all these different efforts, from the outside, you might think ethereum scaling is right around the corner. But there's some disagreement on this, too.  Buterin remains optimistic, saying that within a year he expects plasma, a scaling technology inspired by the lightning network that looks to decrease the amount of data that's stored on the main blockchain, to be deployed by many different startups in place of proprietary permissioned blockchains.  As detailed by CoinDesk, new advancements, such as Plasma Cash, have further mitigated the risks in how plasma chains communicate with the ethereum blockchain.  And those building sharding technology, another scaling solution that purports to lower the data load by splitting the blockchain into parts running on different servers, are making good progress, according to Drake, a developer working of sharding.  Even though Buterin's recent proof-of-concept for sharding was quickly bypassed by further advancements in research, Drake said a ""semi-formal spec"" will be released in the next couple months.  Still, though, there were some on the panel who think true breakthroughs lay further ahead.  “In my opinion, in a year nothing substantial will have changed in regard to fundamental blockchain scalability,” Daian said. Seeming to hint at Project Chicago, his new initiative aimed at redesigning ethereum, Daian went on, “Hopefully in five years we’ll see fundamentally new architectures that are really delivering huge throughputs.”  But even when those new architectures arrive, adding them to ethereum will be a challenge since the protocol must make sure it's all compatible. As such, Daian expects smaller ethereum competitors to be the first to patch in the new architectures.  On top of that, many of these solutions have trade-offs – putting decentralization, verifiability and security on the line – that aren't always considered as much as they should be, Poon said.  “Oftentimes people make claims about scalability and they're not really saying what the tradeoffs are,” he said.  To avoid this, Floersch emphasized the importance of educating users on the value of decentralized technology, so they don't make regrettable choices in the interim.  And Buterin remained positive, concluding:  ""In the longer term, I do think the weaknesses of centralization are going to show themselves.""

42380637,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yecl,1525468517,Thailand Targets New Crypto Taxes While Others Move to Ease Burdens,"An increasing number of countries are looking at the cryptocurrency space, with three national governments launching efforts to regulate and examine projects in the last two weeks. – with a particular focus on tax policy.  As might be expected, some jurisdictions – especially in the Asian market – have moved to clarify the rules that crypto-traders must follow when reporting their gains or losses. And while some of those are in the earliest stages, the developments suggest that government officials want to clear the air of any doubt that may be felt by those working in the space – and who might bring their business to those areas.  To that end, some governments are looking to actually clear the runway, as it were, for companies looking to exchange or trade cryptocurrencies. Part of that involves reducing the tax burden for such companies, with the implicit hope that they'll set up shop in those countries.  Even still, it may be some time before those rules get clarified – at least until next tax season.  Thai taxes take shape  Thailand is on the cusp of implementing a 7 percent value-added tax (VAT) and a 15 percent capital gains tax on cryptocurrency transactions – a move that is coupled with new regulations on exchanges that handle the trade of such assets.  Last week, Thailand's Ministry of Finance noted it was moving ahead with the bill despite a request from the Thai Blockchain Association to relieve some of the tax burdens that will be placed on the community.  The bill will also require exchanges to institute more stringent know-your-customer (KYC) procedures and collect identification data for all their users.  Special zone in the Philippines  The government in the Philippines is taking what you might call the opposite approach.  Officials have announced that they would allow 10 cryptocurrency startups to launch operations in a special economic zone that offers lower tax tiers.  The startups will include miners, ICO platforms, and exchanges. But they aren't just being offered a red carpet – they'll be required to invest in the nation's economy over the next two years. The $1 million investment will come on top of a $100,000 licensing fee, Reuters reported.  The startups will also still be restricted to some degree and will be forced to handle all fiat conversations offshore to avoid violating the nation’s laws.  Feedback for Abu Dhabi  In a less binding move, the Abu Dhabi Global Market’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority released their proposed rules on cryptocurrency trading.  There's no policy set in stone, though. Right now, the agency is looking for feedback from industry members on the framework.  Among other stipulations, the framework outlines anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, consumer protection, technology governance and safe custody rules. Spot crypto assets are also included in the proposed framework.  Mining cease-and-desist  Past tax considerations, state regulators in the U.S. continue to crack down on what they allege are fraudulent schemes targeting would-be investors.  North Carolina’s Secretary of State Securities Division has issued a permanent cease-and-desist against PowerMining Pool, following a temporary order which was sent out in early March.  The regulator alleged that PowerMining Pool violated the state’s Securities Act and using dangerous sales tactics when it was allegedly selling shares in bitcoin to help it mine one of several cryptocurrencies.  In its permanent order, the regulator noted that the company’s website had gone down and that it did not respond to the temporary order.

42380638,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yegX,1525458636,Investor Sues Ripple Alleging 'XRP Is a Security',"An investor who claims they lost money buying and selling the cryptocurrency XRP has filed a class action lawsuit against distributed ledger startup Ripple, alleging that the company violated state and federal securities laws.  Ryan Coffey, represented by San Diego attorney James Taylor-Copeland, filed the suit in the San Francisco County Superior Court on Thursday. Coffey is seeking damages ""on behalf of all investors who purchased Ripple tokens (""XRP"") issued and sold by Defendants,"" naming Ripple, XRP II (the company's registered and licensed MSB), CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and 10 unnamed parties.  Ripple Labs and Garlinghouse have come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks over the degree of association they have with XRP, a cryptocurrency that surged to a market capitalization of over $140 billion in January, but has since fallen below $35 billion. Ryan Zagone, Ripple's director of regulatory relations, told a UK parliamentary committee Tuesday that ""there's not a direct connection between Ripple the company and XRP.""  For some observers, though, the relationship between the company and the cryptocurrency is clear. Thursday's complaint argues:  ""The development of the XRP Ledger, and the profits that investors expected to derive therefrom, were, and are, based entirely on the technical, managerial, and entrepreneurial efforts of Defendants and other third parties employed by Defendants.""  U.S. federal law requires companies selling securities to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Whether a financial instrument qualifies as a security depends on the Howey test, a standard derived from a 1946 Supreme Court case.  If an instrument involves an investment of money and carries a reasonable expectation of profits – an expectation that depends on the actions of a specifically identifiable group of people – then it is a security. Coffey's complaint argues that XRP checks off all of those boxes.  Indeed, the lawsuit is one that could remain a case to watch given that the question of whether XRP is indeed a security is still hotly debated, as profiled by CoinDesk.  When reached for comment, Tom Channick, Ripple's head of corporate communications, told CoinDesk via email:  ""We've seen the lawyer's tweet about a recently filed lawsuit but have not been served. Like any civil proceeding, we'll assess the merit or lack of merit to the allegations at the appropriate time. Whether or not XRP is a security is for the SEC to decide. We continue to believe XRP should not be classified as a security.""  Taylor-Copeland was not available to comment on the complaint before press time.  Read the full complaint below:    Coffey v.

42380643,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yej3,1525454109,Arizona Lawmakers Strip Crypto Mentions From Tax Payments Bill,"UPDATE 4 May 19:00 UTC: Representative Jeff Weninger told CoinDesk that there were insufficient votes for the bill with the cryptocurrency language included. Because Arizona's legislative session ended on May 3, there are no plans to propose a future bill at this time.      Arizona's long-in-the-making cryptocurrency tax payments bill has been further stripped down – so much so that it no longer mentions the technology at all.  The final version of Senate Bill 1091 does not mention cryptocurrencies in any way, despite three previous versions of the bill all specifically including cryptocurrencies as a possible payment method, public filings show. The version of the bill approved by both the House of Representatives and the State Senate does say that the Department of Revenue ""may develop, adopt and use a payment system that enables the immediate remittance and collection of tax.""  It goes on to explain:  ""The Department of revenue may design, develop and provide for trial demonstrations of the adaptation, application and use of technology to enable immediate remittance and collection of transaction privilege tax payments, at the option of the taxpayer, at the point of sale and for payments of additional amounts after audit.""  However, it is unclear whether this technology refers to cryptocurrencies or a traditional banking system.  The bill  originally sought to enable Arizona's Department of Revenue to collect cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, for tax payments. The bill was introduced in January and quickly passed through several committees before being referred to the House, as previously reported. Committees in the House similarly approved the bill's passage, but it stalled at the beginning of March.  Representative Jeff Weninger, one of the bill's cosponsors, later told CoinDesk that the bill was being modified to become more neutral. While the original version specifically mentioned bitcoin, the new version was supposed to be ""agnostic"" about which cryptocurrencies could be collected, he explained.  Following the revamp, the bill was approved by the House Rules Committee and sent up to Ways and Means.  However, a new version was passed by the full House at the end of April. Rather than enabling the Department of Revenue to collect taxes through cryptocurrencies, the bill directed the Department to study ""whether a taxpayer may pay the taxpayer's income tax liability by using a payment gateway."" Possible gateways included bitcoin and litecoin, among other cryptocurrencies.  Senators Warren Petersen and David Farnsworth and Representative Jeff Weninger, the sponsor and cosponsors respectively, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Representative Travis Grantham could not be reached.

""I have written several times warning people about the growing problem of fake stories online linking me to get-rich-quick schemes, fake pages, misleading ads, false endorsements and fake binary trading schemes,"" Branson wrote in a blog post.  ""While I have often commented on the potential benefits of genuine bitcoin developments,"" he continued, ""I absolutely do not endorse these fake bitcoin stories.""  Branson is the founder of Virgin Group, whose portfolio of over 400 companies includes the airline Virgin Atlantic. He has promoted bitcoin and blockchain technology in the past, including through an annual private island summit of industry participants.  Branson singled out one scam – Bitcoin Trader – in particular. CoinDesk visited a site advertising the scheme, which poses as a CNN Tech article, complete with the outlet's logo and formatting – if not its copy-editing.  ""560 Thousand British Quit Their Jobs After Richard Branson Invests Heavily In New Bitcoin Financial Tech."" the headline reads, and the fake article is falsely attributed to a real CNN tech writer.  Branson is not the only publicly recognizable figure to warn consumers about scams being perpetrated in his name. Martin Lewis, a British personal finance writer, recently sued Facebook for its failure to take down ads using his image to push scams.  The problem extends to Twitter, where accounts posing as ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin and various cryptocurrency projects have reached epidemic proportions.  Adding to the growing criticism of social media companies for failing to tackle the problem, Branson wrote Thursday:  ""We also contact the social networks where the fake stories are being spread and urge them to take the stories down and do more to proactively stop them appearing in the first place.""

42380655,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yezP,1525446629,These Crypto Assets Are Pushing the Market Back Toward $500 Billion,"The cryptocurrency markets continued to build on April's gains this week, with alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) leading the way.  Notably, the combined market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies rose back above $460 billion today – the highest level since March 6, representing a week-on-week increase of 15.8 percent.  Out of top 25 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, 23 are reporting gains on a weekly basis, and names like nano (NANO), VeChain (VET) and bytecoin (BCN) are topping the list.  Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is reporting 8.5 percent appreciation, largely due to Thursday's bull pennant breakout.  Meanwhile, other bigwigs like Ripple (XRP), litecoin (LTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH) are reporting 11 percent gains. Ethereum's ether token (ETH) rose above $800 for the first time since early March and has witnessed an appreciation of 23 percent.  Moving forward, the cryptomarkets will likely remain bid as bitcoin is eyeing a big bullish break above the $10,000 mark.  Weekly top gainers  NANO  Weekly performance: +38.20 percent  All-time high: $34.43  Closing price on April 27: $6.99  Current market price: $9.66  Rank as per market capitalization: 25  Nano's USD-denominated exchange rate surged 38 percent this week and BTC-denominated exchange rate (NANO/BTC) appreciated close to 30 percent. The price rally is backed by 517 percent week-on-week rise in daily trading volumes and hence looks sustainable.  NANO/BTC 4-hour chart  The big rounding bottom pattern indicates better days ahead for the cryptocurrency. However, the relative strength index has turned away from the overbought territory, so a minor pullback cannot be ruled out.  Only a break below the ascending trendline support of 0.00094BTC would signal bullish invalidation.  VeChain  Weekly performance: +35.54 percent  All-time high: $9.45  Closing price on April 27: $3.77  Current market price: $5.11  Rank as per market capitalization: 15  VeChain's VET token is solidly bid this week, having witnessed a bullish breakout on April 12. The solid performance could be associated with the excitement about its mainnet launch, scheduled for the end of June.  The price rally is accompanied by a 68 percent week-on-week rise in daily trading volume, which indicates that strong hands are at play.  VET daily chart  The higher lows and higher highs pattern, as marked by the ascending trendline, coupled with the ascending 5-day moving average (MA) and 10-day MA indicate scope for a move above $6.  Note that the relative strength index (RSI) is closing in on 70 (overbought territory), so in the short-run VET may have a tough time scaling the $6.00 mark in a convincing manner.  Bytecoin  Weekly performance: +34 percent  All-time high: $0.017818  Closing price on April 27: $0.005284  Current market price: $0.007081  Rank as per market capitalization: 23  Bytecoin (BCN) remained flat-lined for the major part of the week before picking up a bid on Thursday and rising to a three-month high of $0.00748 (Poloniex price). Daily trading volume has increased more than 50 percent week-on-week, adding credence to the price rally.  BCN daily chart  BCN closed yesterday above $0.006247 (Feb. 20 high) in a convincing manner, signaling a continuation of the rally from the April 1 low of $0.00186. However, the RSI shows overbought conditions, so a pullback could be on the cards. That said, bullish invalidation is seen only below $0.00484 (May 1 low).  Weekly losers  Monero  Weekly performance: -1.55 percent  All-time high: $495  Closing price on April 27: $252  Current market price: $248  Rank as per market capitalization: 13  Privacy-focused monero (XMR) is reporting moderate losses this week, despite a string of good news: the integrations team released a monero payment gateway for Opencart, and abra.com, a financial services and technology company, added XMR to the Abra app, which facilitates trading in 25 cryptocurrencies and 50 fiat currencies.  Moreover, most privacy-focused cryptos got a lift after the recent verge-Pornhub tie-up. XMR rallied to $299 on Bitfinex on April 24 – the highest level since March 8 and looked overbought as per the daily RSI.  Hence, XMR's underperformance is not surprising. That said, the cryptocurrency could regain poise next week, the technical charts indicate.  XMR 4-hour chart  The bull flag breakout seen on the chart indicates the rally from the April 17 low of $193 has resumed. So, XMR looks set to test the resistance at $265 in the short-run. Only a close (as per UTC) below $227 would signal a bullish-to-bearish trend change.  ICON  Weekly performance: -0.70 percent  All-time high: $12.04  Closing price on April 27: $4.3  Current market price: $4.27  Rank as per market capitalization: 21  ICON (ICX) is reporting slight losses this week amid signs of indecision in the marketplace, as represented by the multiple doji candles. When viewed against the backdrop of the rally from the April lows below $1.85, the doji candles likely indicate bullish exhaustion.  ICX daily chart  The doji candles also indicate the bullish breakout (upside break of the falling trendline) has failed. Meanwhile, the RSI is trending lower in favor of the bears, so ICX may revisit the trendline support (former resistance) next week. Note that acceptance below the trendline would put the bears back into the driver's seat.

42380641,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yefH,1525439722,Police Mandate Use of Blockchain Hotel Registry in Indian City,"Police in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh have ordered hotels to deploy a new blockchain security solution developed by local startup Zebi.  According to a Medium post from the startup published last Friday, the product merges blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) to securely store data about hotel guests, and aims to both bring convenience to customers and to help prevent criminal activities.  The data collected is compared with the police database of criminals, missing persons and so on to ascertain whether the guest has any criminal background.  Zebi said that the solution – dubbed Zebi AI Chain – has already been integrated across over 200 hotels, including The Park, Taj Gateway, Novotel in Vizag, the capital of the state of Andhra Pradesh known for its ""Fintech Valley"" ecosystem.  Dr Fakeerappa Kaginelli, IPS, Deputy Commissioner of Police in the Vizag region, confirmed that the use of the solution has been made mandatory for all hotels in the Vizag city limits.  He told Coindesk today:  ""All hotels are directed to enter their check-in particulars on real-time basis without fail and they are adhering too ... 230 hotels are entering their guest particulars through this tech web page.""  The initiative collects real-time date from hotel check-in desks in order to provide ""real-time surveillance over criminals and their anti-social activities,"" he said. ""No criminal activities as such are reported to date.""  Under Indian law, hotels must provide guests' personal data to the police on a daily basis.  “Generally, they do it manually, leaving scope for misuse during transportation and storage of papers. Time to process the documents too is long,” said Babu Munagala, Zebi's founder and CEO, according to the Hindu Business Line.  The posts states that the ""private and sensitive"" data of hotel guests is immutably stored in the Zebi AI Chain system, adding that visitors are asked to give permission for access to the data.  Nagesh Kumar Venkata, assistant front office manager of The Park hotel, was quoted as saying that local police previously had to visit the hotel on a regular basis to ascertain the status of tourists and their backgrounds. ""Now it is not necessary,"" he said.  Looking ahead, Zebi further says it is preparing for ""full-scale deployment across all the hotels in India.""

Chinese banking industry news source CEBNet said Friday that, among the 26 Chinese banks, 12 of them disclosed in their annual filings that blockchain applications were adopted for various use cases over the last year.  The 12 institutions include major state-owned commercial banks such as the Bank of China, China Construction Bank and the Agriculture Bank of China, as well as other privately held ones, including China Merchants Bank and other city-level entities.  The applications that have been adopted range from using blockchain technology to issue invoices and cross-border loans to ID authentication processes.  For example, according to the annual filing from the Agriculture Bank of China, the state-owned entity has developed a decentralized network to offer unsecured loans for agricultural e-commerce merchants that it said offers an automatic loan issuance process.  Similarly, China Construction Bank also disclosed in its financial statement that it has launched a blockchain-based platform that provides cross-bank and cross-border loan issuance for small businesses. The bank further boasts that the platform has so far processed transactions that worth a total of 1.6 billion yuan, or $251 million.  Taking another approach, Bank of China said that it has completed testing for a distributed IT infrastructure to be deployed across its branches for further development of a blockchain-based digital wallet.  The banks' en masse move to adopt blockchain comes at a time when the country's banking regulator has also praised the benefit of applying the technology in the financial sector – especially when it comes to improving the efficiency of loan issuance.

Bitcoin closed yesterday (as per UTC) at $9,759 on Bitfinex – the highest daily close since March 7 – signaling the upside break of the week-long narrowing price range we've been anticipating.  The cryptocurrency also clocked a two-month high of $9,875 yesterday. At time of writing, BTC is changing hands at $9,776 and remains on the hunt for a big break above the $10,000 mark, as indicated by the bullish setup in the technical charts below.  4-hour chart  The chart above shows a pennant breakout (bullish continuation pattern), indicating that the rally from April lows below $6,500 has resumed.  The move has opened the doors for a rise to $10,455–$11,950 (target calculated using two variations of the measured height method).  However, the 4-hour relative strength index (RSI) is close to moving above 70.00, signaling overbought conditions. As a result, a rally to $11,950 looks to be a tough task to achieve and $10,455 may be more realistic.  Daily chart  The ascending, bullish 5-day moving average (MA) and 10-day MA also favor further upside in prices. Meanwhile, the RSI is stationed at 62 – well below 70 (overbought territory), leaving enough room for a rally to $10,400–$10,500.  And, last but not the least, BTC's bullish breakout yesterday was backed by a 35 percent rise in trading volumes, according to CoinMarketCap. A high volume breakout only validates the argument that the rally has legs.  View  BTC looks set to test the 200-day MA resistance of $10,015. A close (as per UTC) above that level would strengthen the bull grip and could yield a sustained rally to $10,455 and above.  The outlook remains bullish as long as prices hold above the ascending 10-day MA, located at $9,290.  An unexpected close (as per UTC) below $8,652 (April 26 low, pennant low) would signal a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.

In an open group Q&A session with tech entrepreneur Wang Feng on WeChat on Thursday, Cai disclosed that although he was holding a single bitcoin in January of this year, he moved to increase his portfolio over the first quarter of 2018 amid the bearish market's lower prices.  Soon after December's record high round $20,000, the price of bitcoin started dropping in January. It reached a low for the year so far below $6,000 in February, before climbing again to over $9,700 at press time. According to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, Cai's holdings are now worth around $96 million.  Cai explained his reasoning for the investment during the Q&A, saying:  ""I only had single digit unit of bitcoin, just for fun in January. But when I got certain that bitcoin and blockchain is the future, I set the goal of holding 10,000 bitcoin. So I started around end of January to build my [holdings] following the price decline.

42401479,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczqiH,1525420831,One of Bitcoin's Biggest Investments Might Finally Be Paying Off,"Bitcoin appears to finally be making headway with one of its less-appreciated, but critical challenges: recruitment.  Simply put, the number of developers contributing to the cryptocurrency's open-source code is suddenly on the rise. Sure enough, there have been at least 21 code submissions approved from new contributors over the past 50 days – and that's no small feat given developers have struggled for years to entice new coders to work on the project.  And while the number of merges over the nearly two-month period didn't jump up drastically, seeing new names within the Github repository is a welcome sight given that most of the hundreds of contributions to bitcoin over the past several years have been coded by a few dozen veterans.  According to several developers CoinDesk interviewed, there isn't a direct correlation they can point to explain the increase, though there are likely contributors. Indeed, for some it's a strong sign serious investments of time and effort in training and academic programs are finally paying off.  ""Many educational and training efforts have lately helped to introduce new developers to Bitcoin Core and the bitcoin software ecosystem,"" Ferdinando Ametrano, a professor at Politecnico di Milano who has served as a program director at bitcoin developer conferences, told CoinDesk.  Ametrano is, of course, talking about efforts such as Chaincode Labs, which has a residency program in New York where prolific bitcoin developers like John Newbery have been giving their time to helping new recruits.  After attending Chaincode's first residency in 2016, Newbery has now taught 11 participants from places like Israel and Hong Kong.  Newbery told CoinDesk:  “It feels like we’re busier now than we were six months ago. It’s almost impossible to keep up.”  But Newbery isn't the only one teaching.  Another possible contributor is Jimmy Song's Programming Blockchain Workshop, which has found the high-profile developer and Blockchain Capital partner teaching roughly 250 people since the workshop launched (in multiple locations across the U.S.) in September.  And demand has been so high that he's offering a few more sessions over the next few months.  Inclusivity boost  Of note, though, is that those surveyed believe these programs could do more than boost contributions to the code by expanding and diversifying bitcoin's pool of contributors.  “One of the things that surprised me is what kinds of people take my class. I expected it to be all developers,” said Song.  But as it turned out, participants ranged from teenage girls to hedge fund managers and retirees.  “Growing the developer team, in numbers and in quality of contributions and everything else, is important because you need a diversity of views,"" Song said. ""You don’t want it to just be a couple of people that do everything.""  Others agree the current hegemony within the bitcoin developer community could set back the cryptocurrency eventually.  Matt Corallo, a long time Bitcoin Core contributor, tweeted in April about the importance of diversifying the ranks, saying:    ""The many studies indicating broader sets of backgrounds and viewpoints add a ton to the quality of decisions made in management should be pretty overwhelming evidence for anyone who cares about evidence-based decision making.""            Song echoed that, noting that bugs can creep in when there are too many developers with the same mindset working on a project.  Newbery continued, explaining that the Chaincode residency and other new educational programs for bitcoin development are touching on one of the key challenges the industry has typically faced – a lack of face-to-face learning opportunities.  He told CoinDesk:  “It’s very difficult if you don’t have that face-to-face interaction with other contributors.""  'So welcomed'  This seems to have played out with Janey Gak, who recently attended one of Song's workshops and is now developing a cryptocurrency wallet for users in developing countries like Afghanistan.  Not only did she learn the technical aspects of bitcoin that she needed to be able to build the app, but also plans on bringing what she knows (and learns) about Afghanistan and the developing world to the Core development community.  And this, according to Song will further decentralize the network and benefit the protocol by having a diverse pool of people to check code.  Echoing this, Newbery told CoinDesk, ""All bugs are shallow given enough eyes. We all see bugs other people don’t see. Having that wide range of backgrounds and experiences is very beneficial to the quality of the project.”  And adding more developers is particularly helpful given that there are only a few dozen people right now with enough experience to properly review prospective contributions, creating a bottleneck. Currently, fewer than two dozen developers work on bitcoin’s software full-time out of roughly 40 regular contributors.  But according to Gak, it shouldn't be all that difficult to attract more developers like herself, since experienced bitcoin developers have been so responsive.  Gak told CoinDesk that after Song's workshop, several developers reached out to her to offer their help on her project.  ""The community is full of very supportive people,” she said, adding:  “I've never felt so welcomed in my life.”  And perseverance  But still, hurdles stand in the way.  The complexity of the protocol on which billions of dollars in value currently depends makes the onboarding process for new developers no small task.  Plus, many of bitcoin's developers work on the project on a volunteer basis, not always the most appealing idea. Although, several sponsorships, including ones from the MIT Media Lab, are allowing bitcoin developers to turn their labor of love into a full-time gig.  Yet still, this type of expertise is rare, with demand currently exceeding the supply of capable developers by far.  Although, this is a challenge shared by all open-source endeavors.  “I’m not sure finding people is a bitcoin-specific problem,” veteran bitcoin contributor Michael Ford told CoinDesk. “Any large open-source project will always struggle to find people who are willing to work or give up their own time for free.""  Although, certain idiosyncrasies may compound the issue in bitcoin’s case.  For instance, Newbery said that Bitcoin Core’s rigorous review process can be off-putting for prospective contributors.  ""Maybe frustration is a challenge for people,” he said. “It feels like the review burden at Bitcoin Core is very high compared to other projects.""  Indeed, Christopher Coverdale, a developer who recently contributed to Bitcoin Core for the first time, told CoinDesk he noticed it takes an unusually long time to get up to speed on the network’s meticulous standards. And while Coverdale plans to continue participating, he added that it requires perseverance.  “The senior developers and reviewers have far too many pull requests to review and have important projects to work on, so understanding that pull requests might be reviewed a week later is perfectly normal,"" Cloverdale said, adding:  “I've also found that patience is really important when contributing to bitcoin.""

But the platform behind the digital rights management-focused coin first unveiled in January says that isn't true.  In an email response to CoinDesk's request for comment, a spokesperson for KODAKOne called the information ""neither authentic nor accurate.""  ""It has come to our attention that more than one fraudulent websites have been promoting the sale of KODAKCoin. All factual information regarding the availability of an ICO to accredited investors will come directly from KODAKCoin and its authorized representatives.""  The rep went on to say:  ""To clarify, WENN Digital is only offering the SAFTs and the underlying KODAKCoin in exempt transactions to 'accredited investors. Offers and sales of the SAFTs and the underlying KODAKCoin outside the United States will also be made in accordance with the laws and regulations of the relevant jurisdictions.""  The KODAKCoin sale was expected to begin at the end of January but was instead delayed for what was initially said to be several weeks.  Most recently, WENN Digital, KODAK's partner in developing the cryptocurrency, is pitching the sale to be conducted by way of Simple Agreements for Future Tokens (SAFTs), which brands the coin to be a utility token and can only be sold to ""accredited investors.""  According to LBank.io's token sale page, would-be investors can purchase KODAKCoin at a 1:1 ratio with tether or USDT, the dollar-pegged cryptocurrency tied to crypto exchange Bitfinex.

42401476,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczqhI,1525406144,These ICO Investors Are Getting Their Money Back – And It's Not Clear Why,"Regulatory uncertainty appears to be arriving late to Washington state.  In what seems like the latest sign concerns are impacting initial coin offerings (ICOs) broadly, Seattle-based Dragonchain is forcing one of its affiliate projects, Norwegian startup Iagon, to return funds it raised from investors back in April – and it's currently unclear why.  In fact, on April 28, the day its presale was scheduled to end, Iagon published a Medium post explaining to investors that the sale had been paused. Notably, it wasn't Iagon's idea; the company had recently joined an incubator backed by Dragonchain, and it was Dragonchain, an enterprise blockchain startup spun out of Disney, that brought the hammer down.  But even Iagon CEO Navjit Dhaliwal said he can't quite account for the turn of events as the ICO, which had raised approximately $1.3 million in ethereum at that time, was cancelled.  Although, he believes it has something to do with regulation, especially a possible stance from the SEC, Dhaliwal wasn't exactly forthcoming with a clear answer.  Dhaliwal told CoinDesk:  ""It is my understanding that Dragonchain is continuing to tread cautiously as the SEC has been investigating all ICO and blockchain projects that arise.""  He continued, saying that Iagon met with Dragonchain on April 30 to get more details, but ""answers remained indirect."" Adding a bit more to the mystery, according to an admin on a public Dragonchain Telegram channel, the Iagon sale was cancelled ""per legal guidance.""  The admin went on, telling members to expect a statement from the Dragonchain CEO about its course of action going forward.  Still, there could be a broader problem at play. The Iagon token sale was part of a program Dragonchain created after raising $13.7 million in its own ICO in November. Five token issuers, including Iagon, have been incubated by the company so far, and pre-sales haven't gone well.  Based on posts in another Telegram channel, investors in the Look Lateral token presale, which ran on Dragonchain late last year, have been asking for refunds, primarily because the team has not launched its scheduled sale.  Another issuer using the platform, LifeID, cancelled its presale based on ""legal advice.""  All these instances seem to point to the regulatory uncertainty around crypto tokens as having a significant impact on the industry that's been built around this new way to raise capital.  And as such, the future of Dragonchain's incubator in likewise uncertain. Several Telegram channel posts indicate that the incubator has been suspended, but no official announcement has been made.  Dragonchain has not responded to repeated requests for comment.  Rough seas  All told, Iagon, which planned to run a public sale with a cap of $77 million starting on May 10, is now scrambling to revise the timeline and find a new partner platform to execute another presale as well as a later public sale.  But in the current environment that could be challenging.  For some, the question could be: why did it take so long for Dragonchain to act on rumors the SEC and other regulators were investigating the space?  Indeed, many began predicting that the SEC would make a move at the beginning of the year, and in March, it was reported that an SEC crackdown was on its way. SEC subpoenas started arriving, government officials began hinting that guidance was imminent and a handful of token entrepreneurs mulling over ICOs and airdrops began pulling back.  But Dragonchain continued on with the Iagon partnership, whereby the Iagon token would be limited to holders of Dragonchain's ""dragon"" tokens.  According to Dhaliwal, Iagon had wanted to collaborate with Dragonchain since the company has a much higher-profile and deeper community than the Norwegian startup.  But, Dhaliwal continued, ""It seems as though Dragonchain has made several changes to their legal team (this is an assumption, due to the answers that were given). It seems as though the new Dragonchain legal counsel members have different views regarding the incubator program or the intricacies of the presale.""  Not much is known about the specific reasons why Dragonchain's new legal counsel is uneasy with the sale, and Dhaliwal would not confirm whether or not unaccredited investors in the U.S. were excluded.  Only allowing accredited investors to buy into a token sale has become standard practice for ICO issuers selling into the U.S. market, primarily because they're typically using a Regulation D exemption, under the Securities Act, to not be classified as a security.  Speaking to the requirements of Reg D, Joshua Ashley Klayman, co-chair of Morrison & Foerster’s Blockchain + Smart Contracts Group, said, ""One of those requirements is that the token seller takes reasonable steps to verify the accredited investor status of purchasers that are US persons.""  Klayman, who is also the chair of the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance Legal Working Group, continued, ""In my experience, many token sellers report engaging certain 'permitted third-party verifiers' to confirm that such purchasers are, in fact, accredited investors.""  New rules needed?  As the regulatory air starts to clear, though, some believe this situation will become all the more common.  For instance, TokenSoft founder Mason Borda tweeted that the Iagon refund will likely be part of a forthcoming trend whereby ICO issuers that missed a part of the compliance flow would be ""cleaning up.""  While there seems to be an increasing interest in designing crypto tokens and the sales to fit under existing regulatory rules, others are pushing for a completely different set of rules to be crafted for the industry.  Dragonchain seems to be interested in the later, writing in a community update, ""It should be noted that until a regulatory framework for utility tokens is defined, 'compliance' seems to be a moving target to which we will always strive to fulfil our due diligence to not only position ourselves as the business blockchain solution but more importantly, to protect all dragon holders — always.""  The update continued, encouraging community members to pressure lawmakers – specifically asking them to reach out to members of the U.S. House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee ""to seek regulation standards and voice your opinion to educate legislators and regulators on the value that blockchain offers.""  One supporter of that notion has even made a Change.org petition on the same topic.  While some major institutional investors have already begun lobbying efforts for the crypto token space, these grassroots efforts are likely to continue since so many retail investors are also involved.  Speaking to what it sees as the importance of these grassroots efforts and seeming to hint at the fact that many think U.S. regulations could send entrepreneurs packing for friendlier jurisdictions, Dragonchain said:  ""Dragonchain is a proud U.S.-based blockchain company and in the spirit of the American Dream, we seek to provide blockchain capabilities to all humans.""

42401472,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczqdM,1525399203,California City's Blockchain Bond Is Definitely Maybe Happening,"In a unanimous vote Tuesday, the city council of Berkeley, Calif., took a step toward approving the issuance of a blockchain-based ""microbond.""  Ben Bartlett, the vice mayor and council member who spearheaded the initiative, told CoinDesk by phone on Thursday: ""It's happening. We passed it.""  But the actual decision taken by the vote is a bit more convoluted.  According to Berkeley's city clerk, the council decided to ""refer to the 2018 prioritization process to direct the City Manager to produce a report outlining steps required if the City were to implement a Pilot Project for the Community Microbond Initiative within 90 days.""  Another member of the city council, Susan Wengraf, cautioned that ""this action does not imply approval at this time.""  But according to a council member who preferred not to be named, the proposal is moving at a rapid clip through the ""byzantine labyrinth"" of city government.  ""This is a really big win,"" the member said, explaining that the strong support signaled by five of the nine council members Tuesday means that, rather than taking a decade, the project is likely to progress rapidly.  Bartlett says that he faced considerable opposition to his blockchain-based municipal bond going into the meeting, with only two members in favor. But his pitch for low-denomination bonds, housed on a distributed ledger, found fertile ground.  Currently, he says, costs imposed by financial intermediaries force municipal bond issues to be large and drive the minimum a person can invest up to $5,000 or even $100,000. ""No one can buy them,"" says Bartlett, adding, ""they're not targeted to specific needs for neighborhoods and communities.""  He believes that blockchain technology could allow for bonds selling at $5, $10 or $25 each, perhaps with tokenized interest payments, while simultaneously increasing transparency:  ""Blockchain allows us to really disintermediate that process and make bonds more affordable for communities and for people.""  'Hyperlocal' uses  Among the projects he thinks Berkeley could fund using the bonds are a homeless shelter, an ambulance or an individual fire truck – ""hyperlocal activities,"" in other words.  The world is watching, Bartlett added.  His office has ""calls coming in from nearly every continent."" And his plans for blockchain-based municipal finance go beyond Berkeley, as a recent Medium post seemingly suggests.  But Bartlett has very little to say about the technical details of the plan. He declined to discuss what network the bonds would be issued on – a freestanding blockchain, Hyperledger, bitcoin, ethereum – or even whether the blockchain would be open or permissioned.  ""I can't speak to that,"" he said. ""We'll see what the best proposal that comes in from the market is.""  The city, he continued, will solicit contracts for the project and ""vendors will do every step of this process.""  Correction: the headline has been updated for clarity.
