42380770,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zQ7t,1528235760,Judge Reopens Cryptsy Customer Class Action Against Coinbase,"A judge in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida has reopened a case involving cryptocurrency startup Coinbase and the now-defunct exchange service Cryptsy.  Cryptsy collapsed in early 2016 amid allegations of fraud and mismanagement and claims that it had been hacked and subsequently drained of its funds. That decline – preceded by months of growing complaints about withdrawals and access to customer money – sparked a class action lawsuit that ultimately led to an $8.2 million judgment against Cryptsy's CEO, Paul Vernon.  In December 2016, a lawsuit was filed against Coinbase by the Cryptsy class-action investors, alleging that Coinbase should have prevented Vernon from funneling their money through the startup's service.  Coinbase sough to argue that those customers are bound by the arbitration agreement Vernon signed, but US District Judge Kenneth Marra – who is overseeing the case in Florida – disagreed. Two other appellate courts subsequently sided against Coinbase, leading to Marra's June 4 order to reopen.  The plaintiff's motion to reopen the case indicated that Coinbase did not oppose the move.  ""Prior to filing this Motion, the undersigned counsel conferred with Defendant's counsel, and has been authorized to represent that Defendant does not oppose the relief sought herein,"" the document states.  On June 1, both the plaintiffs' and defendant's counsel held a case management conference via phone and will submit a report and proposed schedule order before the end of the week.

As such, the site advises that anyone considering funding a token sale should research the people behind a project, avoid sharing any personal information, ask for clear information about the project and be careful if a project promises large returns.  Crypto scammers ""often seem reliable,"" according to the site, but they can still dupe would-be investors.  It explained:  ""Collision with crypto coins can take different forms. Scammers try to trap consumers in different ways. Be extra cautious when paying online with cryptocurrencies, when investing in sports betting with crypto coins and with platforms for investments in crypto coins.""  Further, the site includes a website checker on the home page. The site claims to be able to determine if a website is fraudulent, though it notes that the developers ""are not responsible for any errors in the system.""

At a press conference, the company said Tuesday that its 7nm ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) that will power the new B2 miner is designed in Japan, but manufactured in Taiwan.  The arrival of a 7nm chip is notable since it ushers in more hashing power for bitcoin miners, while at the same time theoretically reducing power consumption, an important factor for miners in seeking return on their investment.  According to a Bloomberg reporter who tweeted from the event, the B2 will provide a hash rate of 24TH/s, with power consumption at 1,950W per unit – that breaks down at 81W per 1 TH/s.  By comparison, the current market leader – Bitmain's Antminer S9 – offers 14TH/s at a power consumption of around 1,300W.  The B2 may offer market leading power, if GMO's figures prove to be accurate, but it will come at a price – $1,999 to be exact. That's compared with $837 for the Antminer S9.  As if there was any doubt that GMO plans to knock Bitmain of its pedestal, the firm's CEO Masatoshi Kumagai reportedly stated:  ""I respect Bitmain, but we will top them""  As reported by CoinDesk, the B2 was revealed on May 24, with GMP saying pre-orders will start on June 6 and shipments to follow in October.

42380771,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zQ99,1528207213,Magic Number? Chart Data Hints at June 6 Bitcoin Boost,"A major reprieve just may be in the offing for the battered bitcoin bulls in the next 36 hours – if, that is, historical patterns repeat themselves.  Intriguingly, the cryptocurrency tends to take a significant change of direction on the sixth day of every month, or at least it has so far in 2018.  Having topped out in the $20,000 neighborhood in mid-December 2017, the cryptocurrency fell to a 2018 low of $6,000 on Feb. 6. Since then, the cryptocurrency has been restricted to a narrowing price range, as indicated by the triangle pattern in the chart below.  What's more interesting is that major price highs and lows over that time have formed around the sixth day of every month.  BTC daily chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:  Bitcoin bottomed out or turned higher from $6,000 on Feb. 6 and $6,500 on April 6.  The lower highs – $11,700 and $9,990 – were created on March 5 and May 5, respectively.  The yearly high of $17,252 was also set on Jan. 6.  Clearly, the tide rebounds in favor of the weaker side on, or close to, the sixth day of every month.  As of writing, bitcoin is trading at $7,433 on Bitfinex – down 34 percent from the bearish reversal point of $9,990, dated May 6, meaning the bulls are currently on the defensive.  Going by the historical pattern, the cryptocurrency seems likely to turn higher in the next 36 hours or so. In this case, bitcoin could revisit triangle (narrowing price range) resistance, currently located at $9,225.  On the other hand, long-term technical studies are biased to the bears, which was not the case on previous occasions.  For instance, the cryptocurrency has found acceptance below the 50-week moving average for the first time since 2015. Further, a 5-month and 10-month moving average (MA) bearish crossover recently occurred for the first time in four years.  So, as always, nothing is guaranteed when it comes to bitcoin price movements. But, just possibly, the cryptocurrency could pick up a strong bid tomorrow, in line with the historical pattern.  Even so, it would be too early to call a bull reversal, given the bearish long-term technical developments, and traders would want to see more evidence – such as a high volume break above the weekly high of $7,779 – before assuming the bulls were back in charge.

42380764,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zQ0L,1528203607,HSBC Exec Warns 'Digital Islands' Could Inhibit Blockchain Trade,"When HSBC's Vinay Mendonca thinks about how distributed ledger technology (DLT) will reshape global trade, he sees two scenarios – one inspiring, the other dispiriting.  In the best case, blockchains and other digital platforms should do for the global value chain what shipping containers did for the physical transportation of goods. Just as the standardized dimensions of containers allowed them to move around the world easily from ship to rail to truck, DLT with data standards and interoperability ought to create seamless flows of value.  But without such standards, trade finance could end up on ""digital islands,"" or silos disconnected from each other, said Mendonca, the global head of product and propositions for global trade and receivables finance at HSBC. And he believes that would do no one much good.  It's perhaps not surprising HSBC is thinking about interoperability; the bank has a finger in just about every trade platform of note.  HSBC was the first bank to partner with and invest in Tradeshift, the digital trade platform which boasts 1.5 million suppliers in 190 countries (Goldman Sachs led a further $250 million funding round earlier this week).  HSBC has also gone well past the proof-of-concept stage, completing the world's first blockchain-based trade finance transaction with food giant Cargill and R3's Corda platform. Further, it's a key member of the We.Trade consortium which uses Hyperledger Fabric – and that's not including a number of Asia-specific consortiums and projects of which it's part.  To Mendonca, it's important to bring the interoperability discussion to the table as early as possible.  He told CoinDesk:  ""A fundamental challenge for all of us is to make all this fit together. So, how do we make sure the Cargill solution on Corda has interoperability with the national trade platform in Singapore, as an example?""  Hence, an ""international set of standards that everybody complies with"" is needed, Mendonca said.  Setting standards  Stepping back, the HSBC executive's concern for how to connect various platforms grows out of a realization that trade finance cannot be digitized in isolation.  It has to be about the total digitization of trade: issuing purchase orders, accepting invoices, shipping goods. Within that merging of physical and financial supply chains, clients can have a discrete step for a financing option, said Mendonca, ""so not a completely different process, but really have that embedded within the existing process.""  Would that it were so simple.  One problem is that construction of much of this architecture is at the R&D stage and so different initiatives and splinter groups are inevitable.  Mendonca said it is difficult to call how things will progress, but he guessed there could be some consolidation happening before too long.  ""Some working groups may merge with others that are more advanced,"" he said, adding that he now only gets excited by projects that can scale for real, as opposed to PoCs done in a lab or a sandboxed environment.  Returning to the question of standards, Mendonca touched on some practicalities whereby the industry needs to decide, ""are these the standards we will all accept on an invoice, on a purchase order?""  Then, if that can be achieved, ""what technology you use to make it happen is probably slightly less of a problem.""  Agreeing on the standards is likely the bigger challenge, he said:  ""We will have to pull together as an industry to make that happen and it's not going to be easy. But to be fair, I think this time around, every working group realizes that it has to be a building block; interoperability shouldn't be an afterthought.""  Collaboration or competition?  This all sounds great, but it's well known that big banks are touchy about sharing anything that could give their competitors an edge.  As well as being careful about data sharing, using platforms like Tradeshift that are essentially ""bank-agnostic"" means valued customers engage with multiple banks.  However, Mendonca pointed out that HSBC has actually been doing this type of thing for years with the SWIFT for Corporates channel, a service provided by the international financial messaging network for treasurers of multinationals.  ""Its big benefit is being bank-agnostic, "" he said. ""For instance, you don't have to connect to five different banks; you connect once and you can give an instruction to all those five banks. So stuff that was put in place a while ago for cash is now available for trade.""  The intuitive play in a more distributed world, then, is to define which factors banks need to collaborate on, and those they compete on. They can agree there's a need to collaborate on the exchange of purchase order and invoice data, for instance, because this will make customers' transactions more efficient.  On the other hand, HSBC would compete with others on the reach of its network to support transactions across the globe, Mendonca said, or the advisory capability of its trade experts and the service levels it offers.  As such, HSBC is not intimidated in any way by other big banks joining it on any particular platform, said Mendonca, concluding:  ""We have been offering supply chain finance solutions to clients for years. When they tell us they are looking at a bigger picture, we understand these end goals.""

42380753,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zPnl,1528201201,China Has Built a Blockchain System That Could Replace Paper Checks,"China's central bank has finished work on a blockchain-based system that digitizes checks issued by domestic businesses, according to a senior official.  In an op-ed published by a local news source on Tuesday, Di Gang, deputy head of the digital currency research lab at the People's Bank of China, said the department has ""completed the infrastructure of a system that issues digital checks based on a blockchain with smart contracts technology.""  According to Di, the work comes after a year-long R&D process that kicked off in 2016 when the lab first announced its plans to look to blockchain technology in the hopes of solving the issue of check fraud in the Chinese market. It was later reported that, in January 2017, the agency had successfully tested a prototype in a virtual environment.  Based on Di's explanation, physical business checks in China function like money orders, except that besides being used to claim a payment from a bank, recipients can also exchange them with other entities.  An apparent problem with the existing system is the large numbers of intermediaries that take on the role of traditional banks to issue checks, and that brings added risks of fraud, he said. Subsequently, fake checks can circulate among commercial banks and potentially undermine the country's financial integrity.  Built to arrive at consensus with the use of practical byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT), Di said the agency's blockchain platform can essentially tokenize checks, while transactions can be controlled via smart contracts.  A main benefit of the system, he said, is to give regulators a transparent overview of the entire life cycle of a digital check, regardless of whether it is being redeemed for cash or being used as a security to back up other corporate assets.

According to patent application filed with China's State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) in November 2016 and made public on Tuesday, the company is eyeing the development of a blockchain network to handle transaction requests for mobile data top-ups and remove the heavy processing load from its data centers.  With such a system, the document says, when a user first signs up for a network plan, an initial top-up transaction will be created together with the user's information. This data is then stored on a blockchain that consists of what the firm calls ""top-up nodes.""  Subsequently, when the user sends requests for further data top-ups, China Mobile would debit funds from the user's account, at which point the blockchain nodes would verify the transaction based on the information it already holds on the user. Following verification, China Mobile would then allocate more mobile data to the user, according to the request.  As such, the system would sustain a chain of records of a user's transaction history in a decentralized manner.  In the filing, China Mobile said that the effort comes at a time when the firm is facing rapidly increasing numbers of mobile devices and a resultant spike in data requests from customers.  The company commented on the potential advantages of the proposed technology, saying:  ""A centralized structure imposes a significant cost of security and trust as it needs to integrate a system's safety, privacy and anonymity into a design ... which inevitably increases the difficulty of technology renovation with even a higher cost of maintenance. As such, we need a new decentralized technology to manage the mobile data allocation.""

42380773,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zQAP,1528192806,Failed Breakout Revives Bitcoin's Bull-Bear Tug-of-War,"Bitcoin's retreat from Sunday's high of $7,779 has poured cold water over the bull mood generated by the weekend's positive price action and neutralized the immediate outlook.  BTC closed on Sunday (as per UTC) above a key falling trendline resistance level, signaling a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change. A bullish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day moving average (MA) also favored a short-term positive price action.  However, bitcoin suffered a rising wedge breakdown (bearish pattern) in the U.S. hours on Monday, signaling that the corrective rally from the recent low of $7,040 had ended.  In the end, the failed breakout was no surprise, as low trading volumes had warned of a bull trap.  At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at a four-day low of $7,426 on Bitfinex, down 2.5 percent over 24 hours.  Daily chart  The above chart shows that bitcoin is back inside a falling channel and risks a quick drop to $6,980 (triangle support) if the bulls fail to defend the support at $7,260 (May 24 low).  Further, the rising-wedge breakdown as seen in the 4-hour chart below, also indicates the corrective rally has ended and prices could soon revisit the recent low of $7,040.  4-hour chart  Still, the overall outlook may be more neutral, with bitcoin creating a doji candle on the 4-hour chart above, signaling indecision in the marketplace.  If the current 4-hour candle closes below $7,732, it could bolster the already bearish technicals (failed breakout). Meanwhile, if the current 4-hour candle closes above $7,500, bitcoin could revisit $7,700.  View  Bitcoin's drop back inside the falling channel as seen in the daily chart indicates the immediate upward pressure has eased.  Acceptance below $7,260 would confirm the corrective rally has ended and could yield a drop to $6,980 (triangle support).  A daily close below $6,980 would signal a revival of the sell-off from the record high of $19,891. In this case, BTC could revisit and possibly break below the February low of $6,000.

The decision came about after the court received an order from Russia's Supreme Court in April to review the case, as previously reported by CoinDesk.  ""The St. Petersburg City Court quashed the decision of the district court to recognize the information posted on the Bitcoininfo.ru website,"" the city court was quoted as saying in a Tass report Tuesday.

In July 2016, the Vyborg district court of St. Petersburg ruled to block bitcoininfo.ru without allowing the site's owners go through an initial trial. The basis of the ruling was that cryptocurrencies are ""a means of virtual payment and accumulation,"" and, thus, providing related information is illegal as it could undermine the country's fiat currency.  Following the ban, the St. Petersburg city court also declined the site owners' appeal to reconsider the case, the report said, until the supreme court overturned the decision.

42380750,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zPmV,1528185645,Verge's Blockchain Attacks Are Worth a Sober Second Look,"The notorious 51-percent attack: it's the major fault in cryptocurrency protocols but it's rarely seen, especially among the most popular cryptocurrencies.  Yet, in the past couple months, the exploit – whereby a single miner (or group of miners) takes control of over half of the network's total computing power and can then bend the protocol's rules in their favor – has been seen twice. And on the same blockchain.  Indeed, verge, a privacy-oriented cryptocurrency recently propelled into the limelight by a partnership with popular adult entertainment site Pornhub, suffered two hacks perpetrated through 51-percent attacks that saw the attackers absconding with millions of dollars-worth of its native cryptocurrency, XVG.  During the first attack in April (only a couple of weeks before the Pornhub partnership), the hacker was able to get away with 250,000 XVG. And during the latest in mid-May, an attacker was able to exploit $1.7 million-worth of the cryptocurrency from the protocol.  According to researchers, the exploits are a product of simple changes to the underlying code which cryptocurrency protocols are typically built on and the challenges of being able to predict what unintended consequences will arise from those changes.  Sure, verge developers were only trying to design a better cryptocurrency for payments, but by tweaking small parameters, such as the length of time a block can be valid, the group has opened its blockchain up to attacks.  ""Getting incentives right and keeping them right is hard,"" Imperial College London assistant professor and Liquidity Network founder Arthur Gervais said.  That is blockchains are built on very precariously stacked incentives whereby all stakeholders work together toward a common goal so as to remove the chance that one entity takes full control.  ""Things obviously don't look good,"" said Daniel Goldman, the CTO of cryptocurrency analysis site The Abacus who's been tracking the attacks. ""The issues that initially slipped into the codebase were a result of pure carelessness — incorporating code from other open-source software without understanding its implications.""  Goldman added:  ""I hate to say it, but if I had to summarize: the attacker is doing better due diligence than the developers. I'd try to poach him if I were them.""  And since veteran blockchain developers, including litecoin creator Charlie Lee and monero lead developer Riccardo Spagni, have long argued the kinds of adjustments the platform made have obvious downsides, such naysayers – who have been readily attacked by a group of enthusiasts calling themselves the ""Verge Army"" – are feeling vindicated.  ""So many important lessons to be learned from this,"" Fidelity investment research analyst Nic Carter tweeted, summing up the general state of verge's development.  Representatives from the verge developer team did not respond to a request for comment from CoinDesk.  The problem  One of those lessons is that there are reasons why the window of time that a transaction can be valid is limited quite strictly.  For instance, whereas bitcoin transactions are only valid for about 10 minutes before they're verified in a block, verge developers extended that window to two hours. And because there is some information asymmetry in blockchain systems since nodes are spread out across the globe, the attacker was able ""spoof"" timestamps tied to blocks without some noticing, according to the widely-circulated post by Goldman.  But it wasn't just that; another piece of the attacks was verge's difficulty algorithm.  Verge uses the algorithm ""Dark Gravity Wave"" to automatically adjust how fast miners find blocks. In verge, this happens every two hours; compared to bitcoin which adjusts every two weeks, verge's algorithm is quite fast.  The spoofed timestamps paired with this fast-adjusting algorithm led to the problem of ""tragically confusing the protocol's mining adjustment algorithm,"" as Goldman put it.  Or said another way, the attacker cleverly mined blocks with fake timestamps, forcing the cryptocurrency's difficulty to adjust down more quickly – making it easier for the attacker to mine even more XVG.  When the first attack happened, verge developers quickly released a patch, stopping the attacker from printing more money. Yet, with the attack last month, it seems the patch only went so far and the attacker found another way to execute the same hack, displaying how difficult it can be to architect a distributed system that isn't vulnerable to attacks.  Continuing attacks  And according to Goldman, the issues for verge are likely not over.  ""An attack clearly was – and maybe still is – being attempted. So far, however, the would-be attacker hasn't managed to overtake the network,"" Goldman told CoinDesk.  But he continued:  ""As it stands now, two of the three (in my opinion) fundamental sources of vulnerabilities have been mitigated at best, and one remains completely unfixed.""  While no XVG were stolen directly from users, miners on the network aren't supposed to be able to bend the rules like this, effectively printing money for one individual in a short period of time.  As such, verge developers are actively working on improving the code. After a period of little communication from verge's developers, CryptoRekt, the pseudonymous author of the verge ""blackpaper"" took to Reddit on May 31, saying, that all of the verge team would ""never intentionally do anything to besmirch or hurt this project.""  He added that the project's developer have been working on new code for ""several weeks"" to ""solidify our currency against any future attacks.""  Yet, Goldman believes there's another problem. Unlike many of the cryptocurrency projects out there today, which rely on open-source code, verge's codebase is being constructed in private and so will not get peer-reviewed by the community of blockchain experts that could help the team find vulnerabilities.      ""Since incorporating code without responsibly vetting it was the thing that led to all this, this should make the vergefam nervous,"" he tweeted.  Verge's future?  But so far, much of the verge community remains supportive of the developer team and the cryptocurrency's mission.  Pseudonymous verge user Crypto Dog went as far as to claim that ""there is no need to panic,"" contending that verge's success will continue no matter what. And CryptoRekt chose to see it as a learning experience, one that would help verge ""build a bigger and better project.""      Still, this attack looks poorly, not only on verge itself, but also on organizations that have partnered with the verge team, Pornhub included. Especially since Pornhub's vice president Corey Price stated verge was chosen as a payment method for the site in a ""very deliberate selection process"" to preserve the financial privacy of their customers.  As such, some developers believe this episode will bring about a heightened sense of responsibility for many organizations to more effectively analyze a blockchain before adopting it.  ""I wouldn't be surprised by more scrutiny in the near future, both leading to more attacks and to investors more accurately rating the value proposition of smaller altcoin projects,"" BitGo engineer Mark Erhardt said, adding:  ""The absence of an attack is not proof that a system is safe. Quite a few altcoin projects appear to be taking unsafe shortcuts. It's just that nobody has bothered to exploit these systemic flaws or weaknesses, yet.""  As such, verge might be the first in a long line of future exploits.  While 51-percent attacks have typically been viewed as hard to execute, Liquidity Network's Gervais argued that new data appears to show that it's easier than many previously thought. He pointed to a new web app, 51crypto, which tracks how profitable it is to execute a 51-percent attack on various blockchains.  The gist of the statistics is, the smaller the blockchain, the easier it is to overtake it and bend the rules, which is why developers need to be particularly careful in how they architect their systems.  Because ""if an attack makes more economic sense over honest behavior, the attackers will be there,"" Gervais concluded.

The new offering, though branded as OK06 Exchange-Traded Tracker (OK06ETT) according to an announcement on Tuesday, effectively represents a basket of crypto assets, the shares of which can be traded as a whole to lower transaction costs and diversify risk.  The company said the ETThttps://www.okex.com/ettPromotion will initially replicate the performance of six cryptocurrencies that are traded on its platform against the U.S. dollar-pegged tether (USDT) cryptocurrency, including bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, bitcoin cash, EOS and OKB – the platform's own utility token.  OKEx said tokens have to be among the top 10 percent in terms of 30-day average trading volume against tether on the platform in order to be eligible for the index. However, OKB is a constituent token of OK06ETT by default, a company representative said.  The announcement comes just days after OKEx rival Huobi Pro also launched a cryptocurrency-based ETF on Friday. That product replicates the market performance of 10 cryptocurrencies on its platform based on their market valuation and liquidity.  Notably, both OKEx and Huobi have opened their crypto portfolios to Chinese investors, but have applied restrictions to exclude users from the U.S. and all its territories.  The offering also prohibits participation from investors in Hong Kong, despite being OKEx's current base, following China's cryptocurrency trading ban in 2017.  Unlike watchdogs in the U.S. which haven't yet given the green light to crypto ETFs in the country, market regulators in Hong Kong have not taken a public stance on the issue.

42401603,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd0CNG,1528171258,When It's Time to Rebalance Your Crypto Asset Portfolio,"Willy Woo is an avid cryptocurrency trader and blogger, whose work is published at Woobull.com and via Twitter at @woonomic.      The ideas in this post first appeared in a tweet published earlier this year.              I think rebalancing a crypto portfolio to reduce exposure to a single crypto asset is the most intuitive yet completely wrong move long term investors make.  Maybe your portfolio starts off nice and balanced and may look something like this...  Maybe ICO ""C"" is that coin you bought only because your friend Carl would not leave you alone and you were sick of mopping up his froth from your new tiled floors every time he visited.  A year later, it turns out ICO ""C"" has Satoshi at the helm, he has solved the scaling problem, integrates a Vitalik Virtual Machine, promises to impeach Trump via a cryptographic proof and will herald a new era of world peace.  Maybe your portfolio now looks like this...  You're now Carl's new best friend. But you're going to rebalance right? You'd be crazy not to right?  Here's the thing about rebalancing a portfolio. Under modern portfolio theory, you want to regularly rebalance your allocations to manage risk and maximize returns. The math seeks allocations that constantly balances your downside risk while maximizing gains, taking into account every market event that may happen, like say famine, an energy shortage or a madman leading a rouge nation into war. Here we are talking about holding baskets in various industries that have reverse correlations.  For example, you may hold both oil and airlines stocks, in an oil shock the two holdings will balance each other out. Oil goes up, airlines go down. But where does your crypto portfolio fit into this?  At this stage of the game, crypto assets are so nascent, they fall under a single sector called ""emerging tech."" These are not mature industries. These are unproven technologies that have not yet made it into the public equity markets to take their stake in the global economy.  Here's what emerging tech really looks like in the pre-IPO game that VCs and Angels play in.  It's a power law. Only a few win. And they win big. The rest die.  Rebalancing a high performer is like selling down your Facebook convertible notes to get more MySpace because you think that should reduce your risk. Like unloading some Amazon.com for Pets.com in the dot-com era. Don't rebalance the winners. Keep to your target allocations.  Token supply as a target allocation  Wait a second….  How can we have target allocations if you're saying it's a mistake to use percentage holdings? I would suggest using an external metric. The best metric I've seen is a percentage of the token supply. This was taught to me by a friend early in my crypto investment career, I call her ""The Coin Whisperer.""  To this day, her existence and wealth remains a legend that is whispered between only a privileged few insiders within the industry. She would take 1/100 of the token supply if she really liked the project, or maybe 1/1,000 of tokens if it was more speculative. Of course, scale this to your own means. Venture Capitalists who work in the domain of emerging tech do exactly this, they take a percentage of the company in (hopefully) the Series A, they never sell out until their liquidity event, the IPO or acquisition.  They understand the power law dynamics between the winners and losers. About those shitcoins, I should add this is not a blanket rule. In many unregulated and thinly traded markets, market manipulations along with pump-and-dump schemes can run rife. By all means sell into a ""shilled shitcoin pump,"" those market manipulations made on thinly-traded, low-quality coin projects.  All my opinions here are in the context of long-term organic moves on quality projects with liquidity.
