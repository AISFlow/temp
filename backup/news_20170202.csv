42399575,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjqA7,1486076070,IRS Seeks to Delay Hearing in Coinbase Data Dispute,"The Internal Revenue Service is seeking to delay an upcoming hearing in its ongoing court dispute with digital currency exchange Coinbase, new court filings show.  According to a stipulation and proposed order filed today in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, attorneys for the IRS have asked to delay a 16th February hearing on petitions by both Coinbase and one of its customers, each of whom have sought to formally intervene.  The IRS had previously filed motions seeking to stop both sides from entering the case.  Now, the US tax agency wants to push that hearing off until 23rd March because it is weighing whether to take additional action in the case, arguing that the hearing may ultimately prove to be unnecessary.  Attorneys for the US government wrote:  “The United States seeks this continuance not for purposes of delay, but rather because the United States is considering filing a petition to enforce or taking other action with respect to the John Doe summons and if more time is provided a hearing on movants’ motions may be avoided altogether, sparing the Court’s judicial resources and the Parties’ time and expense.”  While the filing did not elaborate on why the hearing could potentially become unnecessary, IRS attorneys noted that representatives for both Coinbase and customer Jeffrey Berns “do not object and stipulate to this request for additional time”.  The ongoing case dates back to November, when the IRS first sought court permission to serve Coinbase with a John Doe summons in an effort to identify potential tax cheats, seeking years' worth of user records from the exchange. The IRS has considered digital currencies like bitcoin to be a taxable form of property since mid-2014.  Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley ultimately approved that initial request, a move that was soon followed by Berns’ initial petition to intervene.

42399579,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjqD4,1486063961,Irish Fund Managers Investigate Blockchain-Powered Data Reporting,"A trade group for investment funds in Ireland has announced it is developing a new blockchain proof-of-concept focused on regulatory reporting.  The Irish Funds Industry Association, which counts more than 100 banks, fund administrators, advisories and law firms among its membership, said today that it will explore the development of a platform on which both institutions and regulators can oversee relevant data.  Active participants cited in the announcement include fund managers Metzler, Northern Trust and State Street.  Irish Funds CEO Pat Lardner cited the need for more robust reporting tools, highlighting the project’s development against the wider backdrop of fintech growth in Ireland.  He said of the launch:  “Regulatory reporting is a key obligation for our members and an area of priority focus for the Central Bank of Ireland in 2017. This project and the development of the proof of concept with Deloitte will benefit industry, the regulator and demonstrates how Ireland is actively embracing FinTech.”  The group is working with Deloitte, which is a member of the group, to develop the PoC. Development will be taking place at the firm’s blockchain labs in Dublin, which formally opened for business last month.

42399569,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjq4D,1486062014,Bitcoin's Privacy Gets 'Failing Grade' in 2016 Threat Report,"A new report by an open-source advocacy group has found that bitcoin users still face major threats to their privacy.  The Open Bitcoin Privacy Project (OBPP) published its latest study today, which explores the state of bitcoin privacy throughout 2016 and identifies key vulnerabilities in the ecosystem.  Composed of developers and researchers in the bitcoin space, OBPP has previously weighed in on user privacy issues related to bitcoin wallets, releasing two editions on the subject since 2015.  The newest report identifies four major threats that confronted bitcoin users over the past year. These include the merging of co-owned funds into single transactions; the re-use of bitcoin addresses; the linking of network identity to a particular bitcoin address; and the linking of addresses together through network activity.  The publication perhaps speaks to one of the key underlying aspects of bitcoin itself, given that the digital currency provides a pseudonymous, open-access means of moving money throughout the world. For some, financial privacy is one of the reasons they turned to the digital currency in the first place.  It also highlights how cybersecurity risks can undercut those characteristics, as well as what steps can be taken to reduce the threats involved. For example, OBPP suggests the utilization of the Tor network or similar tools – which route data to different points around the world, obscuring its origin and destination – to avoid having one’s identity tied to a particular node.  The report's release comes as regulators worldwide see the privacy-enhancing features of digital currencies as a growing concern. Last month, for instance, a group of law enforcement agencies and organizations, including Interpol and Europol, called for a crackdown on transaction mixers, or tools that can obfuscate the source of funds by combining them with other transactions.  During a recent conversation with CoinDesk ahead of the report's release, OBPP contributor Kristov Atlas described the state of privacy in the ecosystem today as ""pretty bad"", noting that work on wallet privacy has fizzed out in the past year or two.  He went on to state:  ""Practical improvements to privacy have kind of stopped for the moment. Overall, I would give the industry a pretty failing grade.""  As for what’s driving the deficiencies around privacy, Atlas highlighted regulatory issues as well as technical ones, suggesting that it’s likely ""a confluence of challenges"" inhibiting broader focus.  Challenges aside, Atlas stressed his belief that privacy should be prioritized by companies who offer tools for transacting in bitcoin.  ""I think it’s important to try to get these privacy concerns on the to-do lists of companies and remind them that it’s important, and that it’s something they haven’t fully tackled yet,"" he said.

42399571,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjq7A,1486044613,How Blockchain is Helping Solve Japan's 'Galapagos Syndrome',"Like the islands that inspired Charles Darwin’s seminal work on evolution, ""On the Origin of Species"", Japan’s technology sector is a diverse place that, historically, has had some interoperability issues.  The same isolation that led to the evolution of the giant tortoise, the marine iguana and 13 unique species of finch in the Galapagos Islands has led to similarly surprising diversity of tech in Japan, ranging from feature phones with solar panels to tiny cars and ATMs from which Westerners can't withdraw funds.  This local quirk is called 'Galapagos Syndrome' in Japan, and while this chronic uniqueness has led to an impressive array of fascinating technology, it has also prevented much of these innovations from being adopted around the world.  Behind 'Galapagos', as the trend is called for short, is a desire by the Japanese government for the island nation to maintain its distinctiveness in an increasingly global economy, according to Yoichiro 'Pina' Hirano, founder and CEO of Tokyo-based Infoteria, a middleware provider that helps connect the front and back offices of 5,700 companies around the world.  As it turns out, the key to overcoming the Galapagos trend might be found in the nation's varied blockchain ecosystem.  Hirano is the co-founder of the Blockchain Collaborative Consortium (BCCC), which aims to create platform-neutral blockchain interoperable solutions for a diverse set of industries.  According to Hirano, who was once an early employee at Lotus 1-2-3, the Japanese government doesn’t set out to isolate Japan and its 127 million inhabitants. But a policy of standards selection and investment has largely cut off the nation’s technological developments from the rest of the world.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Hirano said:  ""The Japanese government wanted to differentiate the new technology from the [rest of the world], so they put their budget to some unique features for Japanese companies. But the other result is bad interoperability, or bad compatibility. So that makes a 'Galapagos' product.""  Locked-in industry  In addition to an investment strategyhttps://www.jetro.go.jp/en/invest/incentive_programs/ that Hirano said incentivizes global market differentiation, as well as a disproportionate percentage of Japanese companies actually being owned by the government, he said other decisions have led to the country being cut off.  Japan has also implemented unique technology standards that make it more difficult for foreign competitors to compete in the local market, while simultaneously making it harder for Japanese companies to expand internationally.  The BCCC has adopted a different philosophy. The consortium aims to be blockchain neutral, with multiple large-scale projects currently being developed to enable international business. Support for the initiatives is expected to come from founding member Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing services and others.  Of the 120 companies Hirano now lists as members of the consortium, the vast majority are based in Japan, with a few outliers, like Microsoft, based in Seattle, and ConsenSys, based in New York.  However, all are committed to the same cause: breaking down Japan’s Galapagos Syndrome by building on distributed ledger tech.  The BCCC’s founding charter states:  ""We who believe in the future of blockchain technology, strive to help Japan stay competitive and contribute to the evolution of blockchain technology by sharing information, competing fairly, promoting blockchain, actively expanding the scope of blockchain applications, and supporting funding for blockchain research. We will coordinate with other blockchain organizations around the world.""  Building a crypto-yen  Formally launched in April of 2016, the BCCC has grown from 34 founding members to 120 today, many of which are active participants in building two blockchain proofs-of-concept (PoCs) revealed to CoinDesk.  The first PoC is a project aimed at creating a digital version of Japan's national currency, the yen.  In total, Hirano expects about 30 companies will participate in the 'Digital JPY' project.  While the Bank of Japan is not currently participating in the PoC, Hirano said he explained the plan to the central bank on 19th January and officials there reportedly expressed interest.  ""They said they cannot join,"" Hirano told CoinDesk. ""But they want to observe.""  A second PoC currently being developed is a blockchain implementation of Japan’s Smart Cities initiative to automate large groups via the Internet of Things powered by a shared ledger. Hirano expects about 20 team members will join that project.  While many of the BCCC members are currently doing independent blockchain research and constructing their own PoCs, Hirano said the consortium efforts are of a different sort.  ""We want to exchange that knowledge and we want to make some inter-company proof-of-concept work,"" he explained. ""Especially in the financial industry, blockchain implementation needs to be inter-financial [effort].""  Skills shortage  As the BCCC's projects have progressed, though, one common problem has arisen: a lack of staff trained in the art of the blockchain.  The problem is so pronounced that, in May, Reuters reported that a shortage of blockchain engineers was causing Japan to fall behind other regions' efforts, including Europe and the US.  To help BCCC members solve the problem, the consortium last year launched Blockchain Daigakko, an educational effort devoted to training students to help give them the skills to build with blockchain.  So far, 99% of the 100 students who have graduated have come from the consortium’s own membership, according to Hirano, and returned to those jobs after graduating the two-month class. Courses are taught by BitBank adviser Jonathan Underwood, a native of the US who moved to Japan eight years ago.  Hirano breaks down blockchain developers into two categories: those who build blockchains, and those who build on blockchains. Member demand largely focused on those who build on existing blockchains, and so the class curriculum is designed accordingly.  ""For the companies, for the industries, blockchain engineers who can use and who can implement blockchain are very much needed,"" said Hirano. ""People feel the shortage.""  Leaving Galapagos behind  As Japan’s years-long escape from Galapagos Syndrome has faced its obstacles, blockchain has increasingly been seen as a way to connect the nation.  In addition to recent reports that Japan’s central bank has been ""test driving"" distributed ledgers, the Japanese government itself is funding travel costs for three of its country’s native blockchain startups to attend the “Project for a Bridge of Innovation between Silicon Valley and Japan”, an international cooperative effort.  But the problems of interoperability cited by Hirano are far from exclusively a Japanese problem.  Because the network effects of blockchain are amplified by the number of users, the push for better networks is truly global. Global accounting firms, standards bodies, startups and legacy institutions have all been working to ensure a fabric of blockchains is interconnected.  While nationally specific standards and proprietary blockchains can be used to create benefits for those that employ them, Hirano argued the benefits are only short-term and will eventually restrict growth.  Hirano concluded that, for blockchain consortia to truly blossom, they should learn a lesson from Japan's Galapagos Syndrome, adding:  ""It’s not easy, but that is our big mission in Japan, to make blockchain powerful and take the full potential of blockchain to any company.""

The organization launched the donation option in November 2015, enabling contributions from customers by way of their donor-advised funds. Fidelity Charitable has utilized Coinbase as a payment processor to handle bitcoin-to-dollar conversions.  New statements from Fidelity Charitable indicate that those efforts have paid off.  The organization said today:  “To support strategic giving and as part of a broader expansion in November 2015, Fidelity Charitable began accepting bitcoin, resulting in an unprecedented $7 million in contributions in 2016 made from donors across the country. These donors were able to maximize their contributions with Fidelity Charitable efficiently monetizing the bitcoin for grant-making.”  While the organization didn’t go into further detail, the results seem to confirm hopes that the bitcoin option would spur new methods of donating. When the option was launched in 2015, Fidelity Charitable senior vice president Matt Nash positioned the move as another way to engage with the group’s network of 100,000 donors.  ""Enabling donors to contribute bitcoin to their donor-advised funds is the latest example of Fidelity Charitable's commitment to making it as easy as possible for donors to support the charities they care about with the assets at their disposal,” he said at the time.

42399588,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjqLv,1486040432,459 Million Bitcoins: Exchange Volume Reached Peak Levels in Q4,"Bradley Miles is an analyst at CoinDesk Research where he contributes to CoinDesk's quarterly State of Blockchain report.  In this piece, Miles releases early findings from our forthcoming State of Blockchain 2017 report, due out in February.  The fourth quarter of 2016 was a volatile period for the price of bitcoin, as speculation climbed to new heights and exchange-traded volume reached peak levels, according to data provider Bitcoinity.  Even before bitcoin approached $1,000 at the end of Q4, a record 114m bitcoins were exchanged in the month of October alone.  The record was shattered in the following month with 175m bitcoins traded in November, followed by a slight downtick in December with 170m bitcoins exchanging hands.  Exchange-traded volume for bitcoin experienced a 275% quarter-over-quarter increase to 459 million bitcoins in Q4 of 2016, from 122 million bitcoins in Q3.  Compared the figures year-on-year, trading volume in Q4 of 2016 jumped up 206% from 150m bitcoins traded in Q4 of 2015.  Yet, the volumes from Q4 only tell part of the story.  A large concentration of exchange-traded volume typically occurs in China's 'Big Three' bitcoin exchanges: BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin (at least, before they recently announced sweeping policy changes).  The trading volume of these three alone totaled 452m bitcoins in Q4 of 2016, a staggering 98% of all trading volume for the quarter, but there is reason to believe that figure may be inflated.  Some investors and entrepreneurs remain skeptical of this notorious metric, stating that the ""true volume"", or what the volume would have been if these exchanges charged trading fees, is closer to 85%.  This discrepancy may not sound large, but at 98% of exchange traded volume, China's volume is about 49x the rest of the world, whereas at 85%, Chinese exchange traded volume is only around 6x as large. That's an order of magnitude reduction in sheer volume size (approximately 8.6x).  Clearer picture  As the zero-fee era of Chinese exchanges comes to a close and markets begin to stabilize following the election of Donald Trump, it’s anyone's guess as to where exchange traded volume will fall at the end of the first quarter of 2017.  However, given the shake-ups at the 'Big Three', it appears the cryptocurrency community will get a look at the 'true volume' results for exchange traded bitcoins in the coming months.
