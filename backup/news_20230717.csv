15008492,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542965,1689636611,Bearish Signal: BNB Open Interest Skyrockets To New Highs,"Crypto exchange Binance has been the subject of intense regulatory scrutiny over the last few months and BNB has suffered as a result. Even now, as it seems the crypto exchange is beginning to find its footing once more amid regulatory wolves circling, its native token is still under immense selling pressure. This is evidenced by the BNB open interest, which has now skyrocketed to new all-time highs. BNB Open Interest Reaches New All-Time High In an interesting turn of events, BNB shorts are ramping up even at a time when the crypto market seems to be on a recovery trend. According to a Twitter post by analyst Dylan LeClair, this has caused the open interest in the digital asset to rise exponentially. Related Reading: Crypto Liquidations Cross $300 Million Amid Massive Market Recovery The chart shared by LeClair shows that BNB‚Äôs open interest is now sitting at $400 million. This is over four times higher than the previous all-time high for the digital asset which was $50 million back in 2020. And unlike then, the surge in open interest right now is more bearish than it is bullish. Hmmm, some interesting flow in $BNB futures: ‚Äì Perpetual futures open interest is seeing new highs as funding rates have gone deeply negative (-200% APR for next funding period) (Chart #1) ‚Äì looks as if someone is getting ahead of some bad news flow. ‚Äì The last time BNB‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/1B27OkjvPx ‚Äî Dylan LeClair üü† (@DylanLeClair_) July 17, 2023 This current increase has seen funding rates move above negative 200% and yet traders continue to short the altcoin. The fact that traders are choosing this route despite the high cost to do so points to the expectations of a massive crash coming for the digital asset. As LeClair points out, this could mean that the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) is finally leveling charges against the crypto exchange. ‚ÄúAnd people in the know are positioning accordingly.‚Äù Will The Altcoin Survive a DoJ Lawsuit? As already demonstrated by the Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs (SEC) lawsuit against the Binance crypto exchange, a lawsuit from regulators would have an adverse impact on the price of BNB. When the SEC sued the exchange in early June, the price of BNB plummeted by over 20% over a few days period. BNB price continues to hold above $240 | Source: BNBUSD on TradingView.com Given such a response, a lawsuit from the DoJ would be even worse because of its implications. And if this were to happen this week, then another 20% decline from here would see the digital asset lose its footing above $200. Related Reading: Polygon Upgrade Proposal Pushes Price Over 5%, Is It Too Late To Buy? For right now, the price of BNB is still holding up nicely above $240. One reason for this could be the Arkham sale being carried out on the Binance launchpad. As this sale requires BNB for subscriptions to participate, it has provided temporary buy pressure for investors to participate. However, once the sale ends on July 18, this temporary plug would be eliminated and the cryptocurrency will likely fall back to the $230 territory.

15006570,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543029,1689632349,This Bitcoin Continuation Pattern Points To 3-6 Months Of Uptrend Ahead,"Bitcoin price is pulling back after a strong finish in the crypto market last week. However, this past Sunday night‚Äôs weekend close was also the close of the 4-week BTCUSD chart, which has potentially confirmed a high timeframe continuation pattern. If the continuation pattern is indeed valid, it could point to 3-6 months of an extended uptrend, making 2023 an extremely bullish year in the end. Here is everything you need to know about the bullish continuation pattern and what it could mean for the crypto market. Bullish Candlestick Continuation Pattern To Light Up Second Half Of 2023 2023 has been an interesting year in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin has been mostly bullish, but nothing compared to what we‚Äôve witnessed in the past ‚Äî as recently as 2020. Meanwhile, altcoins have been long suffering an onslaught from the US SEC. This has kept Bitcoin further at bay against the US Dollar, while eating up altcoin capital on the BTC pair. Despite an important week for the industry and BTCUSD setting a new high for the year, Bitcoin lost some momentum and is now trading below $30,000 per coin. However, before the correction happened, the 4-week BTCUSD candle also closed on Sunday night. Related Reading: Perfect Storm: Why Bitcoin & Crypto Are Poised For A Dramatic Recovery The 4-week timeframe is slightly more sensitive than the monthly at between 2 to 3 days less, sometimes offering unique signals from the 1-month. Sunday night‚Äôs close forever marked the chart with the last candle necessary for a completed Rising Three Method pattern. The Rising Three Method is a bullish Japanese candlesticks continuation pattern. It consists of a large white candle, followed by three small-bodied candles in a row. After the period of consolidation, a large white candle closes above the trio of black candles, engulfing them all. The Rising Three Method pattern | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Bitcoin Buyers Make A Statement: Rising Three Method Pattern Completes The pattern shows that after a pause, buyers resume control. By making this statement, bulls could gain control of Bitcoin over the next 3 to 6 months. The reason for the timing, is due to the length of each candle‚Äôs session. After a Japanese candlestick pattern confirms, its expected results should appear within the next 3-5 candlesticks. 3-5 sessions of 4 weeks total, equals roughly 12 to 20 weeks, or around 3-5 months. That timing would take any potential bull rally through the end of the year. For further validation of the fact upside should appear within 3-5 candles after a confirmed signal, we can see that a morning star pattern completed during the first candlestick close of the year. The second candle of the year was a doji, then this bullish continuation pattern formed. All of this combined tells a possible story of a continued bull market for the rest of the calendar year. Related Reading: The One Ingredient Missing From A Full-Bore Bitcoin Bull Run The Japanese candlestick continuation pattern also comes with plenty of confluence through a confirmed bullish crossover of the LMACD. The technical indicator suggests a momentum shift supportive of more upside in Bitcoin. Will this continuation pattern result in a strong bull market breakout?

15005317,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543004,1689629440,"Uniswap Launches UniswapX Protocol, Sparking 3% Surge In UNI‚Äôs Price","Uniswap, the leading decentralized exchange (DEX), has announced the launch of UniswapX, a permissionless and open-source protocol for trading across automated market makers (AMMs) and other liquidity sources. According to the announcement, UniswapX aims to improve self-custody swapping and grow on-chain trading by offering better prices through the aggregation of liquidity sources, gas-free swapping, protection against maximal extractable value (MEV), and no cost for failed transactions. Uniswap Latest Protocol Launch UniswapX addresses the growing complexity of on-chain routing and the fragmentation of liquidity pools resulting from the increasing number of customized pool designs. The protocol outsources routing complexity to a network of third-party fillers who compete to fill swaps using on-chain liquidity like AMM pools or their private inventory. This allows swappers to use the Uniswap interface without worrying about getting the best price and ensures that transactions are always transparently recorded and settled on-chain. Related Reading: zkSync Unveils Boojum Upgrade: The Ultimate Solution For Scalability And Security? Per the announcement, gas-free swapping is a key feature of UniswapX. Swappers sign a unique off-chain order, which is then submitted on-chain by fillers who pay gas on the swappers‚Äô behalf. This eliminates the need for swappers to pay gas or hold a chain‚Äôs native network token to trade. MEV protection is also provided by UniswapX, which returns MEV that would be left on the table to be captured by an arbitrage transaction to swappers through improved prices. UniswapX also has plans to launch a cross-chain version later this year that combines swapping and bridging into one seamless action. This will provide users with the ability to exchange between different blockchain networks in a seamless and trustless manner. This is made possible through the use of bridges, which are specialized smart contracts that enable the transfer of assets between different blockchain networks. In addition, instead of receiving a bridge-specific token, users can choose which assets to receive on the destination chain. Strong Resistance Causes UNI To Retract After the announcement of the launch of the UniswapX protocol, the price of Uniswap‚Äôs native token, UNI, experienced a surge of around 3%. UNI reached a high of $6.152, a level not seen since April 2023. The excitement generated by the launch of this new protocol led to a surge in demand for UNI, as traders anticipated improved user experience and better prices for on-chain trading. Related Reading: XRP Crosses 1 Million Trades Per Minute Following Court Ruling However, UNI faced a strong resistance line at this same level, causing the token to retrace and lose all the gains generated by the announcement. At present, UNI is trading at $5.738, down by 1.4% in the last 24 hours. Despite this recent dip, UNI has posted significant gains in the 30-day timeframe, with a staggering 28% profit. On the flip side, according to Token Terminal data, Uniswap‚Äôs market cap (circulating) currently stands at $4.76 billion, representing a 28.3% increase over the past 30 days. The market cap (fully diluted) is $5.77 billion, up 26.01% over the same period. Uniswap‚Äôs total value locked (TVL) is currently $3.67 billion, a decrease of 0.54% over the past 30 days. The price fees (P/F) ratio (fully diluted) stands at 17.50x, indicating that the market values Uniswap‚Äôs future earnings potential at a premium. Uniswap‚Äôs trading volume (annualized) is $349.19 billion, representing a decrease of 8.05%. In terms of user activity, Uniswap has had an average of 69.640 daily active users over the past 30 days, representing an increase of 2.7%.

42393069,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgFf79,1689627246,"Despite BlackRock, Don‚Äôt Expect a Flood of Spot-Bitcoin ETFs Soon: Experts","Are we about to see a wave of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF)?  If you‚Äôve been in crypto for a while, you‚Äôll know that ETFs have long been considered key for building a broad-based market for digital assets. And recent news that BlackRock, no less, had submitted a proposal to set up such a vehicle raised hopes. If a bellwether, well-connected institution like BlackRock was getting into Bitcoin ETFs, surely an approval, and the first U.S. crypto ETF, couldn‚Äôt be far off.  Well, we may have to wait a little while yet, according to a range of experts contacted by CoinDesk.  Around the same time as BITX‚Äôs approval, institutions filed a spate of applications for spot bitcoin ETFs with the SEC that stated they would enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement with Coinbase, including one from BlackRock. Since Bitcoin (BTC) briefly climbed above $31,000 after the flurry of ETF filings, the entry of the world‚Äôs largest asset manager with more than $10 trillion in assets under management (AUM), reflected a ‚Äúhow-will-the-SEC-turn-this-financial-giant-down‚Äù and a ‚Äúsurely-BlackRock-is-filing-only-because-they-know-it‚Äôll-eventually-happen‚Äù kind of market sentiment.  You have to ‚Äúlisten‚Äù when BlackRock comes to the market, Bitwise Asset Management Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan told CoinDesk TV. Like BlackRock, Bitwise also refiled for a bitcoin spot ETF. And brokerage firm Bernstein added to the expectations when it said the SEC‚Äôs stance on spot bitcoin (BTC) ETFs is a difficult one to hold, and the probability for approval is fairly high.  But others like Opimas LLC CEO and founder Octavio Marenzi said the application is dead on arrival.‚Äú They've identified a custodian for the assets that the SEC itself has said is operating illegally...I don't quite see how BlackRock makes this happen,"" Marenzi said.  It‚Äôs been a decade since the crypto industry first sought to launch a spot bitcoin ETF and one person who understands the process intimately doesn‚Äôt see any approvals any time soon.  Volatility Shares‚Äô 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX) became the first leveraged crypto ETF available in the U.S. on June 27, and at the helm of its carefully filed application with the SEC was Chief Investment Officer Stuart Barton.  ‚ÄúThe hold-up is because of the unregulated nature of the crypto exchanges,‚Äù said Barton. ‚ÄúIt takes a long time for an exchange to become regulated. That is a multiyear process. That‚Äôs a step before we get to an ETF approval. At the moment, there‚Äôs no exchange on which bitcoin trades that is regulated.‚Äù  CoinDesk also spoke to two other industry experts ‚Äì hedge fund manager James Koutoulas who is currently fighting the SEC‚Äôs motion to subpoena him over and a political meme coin targeting Joe Biden and Jai Waterman, CEO of blockchain-based trading platform Blockstation.  They both poured cold water on the idea of an immediate spot bitcoin ETF approval in the U.S. Koutoulas, based on the experience of his ongoing troubled legal situation with the SEC, said that while the crypto community‚Äôs optimism is justified, he‚Äôs not sure it‚Äôs going to be 100% founded in eventual approval.  ‚ÄúIt's not a foregone conclusion that an ETF will be approved,‚Äù Koutoulas said. ‚ÄúYou just have to look at the conflicts (example: lawsuit against Coinbase) for that.‚Äù Waterman said the SEC is in a difficult position with political pressure but it‚Äôs still ‚Äúgoing to take a long time.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe ETFs will not be approved until the Coinbase lawsuit is settled or squashed,‚Äù Waterman said. ‚ÄúThey may transition and use somebody else instead of Coinbase but that‚Äôs also difficult because regulators will want an organization with strong credibility and no ongoing lawsuit against them.‚Äù  BlackRock‚Äôs CEO Larry Fink seems convinced, however. He has gone from saying fans of the asset class heavily used it for ‚Äúillicit activities‚Äù to saying bitcoin could ‚Äúrevolutionize the financial system‚Äù but a recent comment indicated that even he thought an ETF approval could take time.  ‚ÄúWe hope that, like in the past, we could be working with our regulators and get the filing approved one day, and I have no idea what that one day will be, but we‚Äôll see how that all plays out,‚Äù Fink said earlier this month.  XRP ruling adds to pressure on SEC  In addition to the approval of the leveraged product, BlackRock‚Äôs application and the subsequent market optimism, the XRP ruling has put collective pressure on the SEC, according to experts. Last week, a U.S. court ruled partly in Ripple‚Äôs favor saying the sale of Ripple‚Äôs XRP tokens on exchanges and through algorithms did not constitute investment contracts.‚ÄúThe XRP ruling could support Coinbase‚Äôs case,‚Äù said Waterman. ‚ÄúThat could be another point of pressure on top of these ETF applications. However, I do think the SEC will appeal the Ripple decision.‚Äù  Koutoulas said the XRP ruling has dealt a very sharp blow to the SEC because it confirms everything the crypto law community has been arguing in terms of the SEC‚Äôs overreach. ‚ÄúMerely hours after their devastating loss in XRP ‚Ä¶ the SEC rushed into court to harass me with a subpoena, admitting ‚Äòthe question of whether or not our political meme-coin is a security is for another day,‚Äô‚Äù Koutoulas said, quoting the SEC‚Äôs subpoena.  ‚ÄúClearly this subpoena isn‚Äôt about a legitimate investigation, it‚Äôs about weaponizing the federal government against cryptocurrency and political opponents.‚Äù  Leveraged vs. spot-bitcoin ETFs  Lawyers for waterman manager Grayscale added more pressure on the SEC when they criticized the regulators for approving Barton‚Äôs leveraged bitcoin-based ETF after having rejected Grayscale‚Äôs spot bitcoin ETF application. They addressed a letter to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit alleging that the SEC approved a leveraged ETF ‚Äúthat is even riskier‚Äù than Grayscale‚Äôs own spot bitcoin ETF. Grayscale has been embroiled in a lawsuit with the SEC over rejection of its own spot bitcoin ETF application. Grayscale is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk‚Äôs parent company.  Barton said the process to approve a leveraged ETF and a spot-bitcoin ETF are just different. ‚ÄúThe difference between our leveraged ETF and a spot-bitcoin ETF is that our ETF tracks bitcoin futures that trade on a regulated exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), but the proposed bitcoin spot-ETF plans to reference bitcoin cash which is not traded on any regulated exchange,‚Äù Barton explained.  The CME replaced Binance as the world‚Äôs biggest bitcoin futures platform in 2021.  'Methodology is extremely hard'  Barton said the methodology in place for the approval of spot-bitcoin ETFs puts the SEC in a very powerful position because of a listing rule ‚Äì 19b-4. The rule requires self-regulated entities to seek the SEC‚Äôs approval before making any changes to trading rules. In this case, NASDAQ and the Cboe‚Äôs BZX Exchange are asking to take over compliance responsibilities given, Coinbase, the chosen surveillance partner is an unregulated exchange, does not satisfy the SEC‚Äôs requirements. As part of this rule change, NASDAQ and Cboe BZX are looking to fulfill some of Coinbase's compliance obligations through a surveillance-sharing agreement. Coinbase is so far an unregulated exchange, and therefore presently does not satisfy the SEC‚Äôs requirements.  ‚ÄúThe challenge of an ETF application that needs a 19b-4 is that the exchange needs a specific approval ruling from the SEC to list, and that puts the SEC in a very powerful position,‚Äù said Barton.  ‚ÄúThe exchanges don‚Äôt only have to argue that the ETF falls under a certain set of ETF rules, but also have to answer a far broader set of questions from the SEC because they're really asking them ‚Äòplease can we change the rules of our exchange in order to list this new product as a new ETF‚Äô and very few 19b-4s get filed and can be a very long process.‚Äù  All five of Cboe‚Äôs ETF applications: Wise Origin, WisdomTree, VanEck, Invesco Galaxy and ARK 21Shares, and BackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust have filed 19b-4 applications. ‚ÄúThe weakness of an application that needs 19b-4 is that you need a specific approval ruling to list from the SEC and that puts the SEC in a very powerful position,‚Äù said Barton. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt have to argue with you on whether this is a good investment. They get to drill down because you‚Äôre really asking them ‚Äòplease can we change the rules of our exchange in order to list this new underlying product as a new ETF‚Äô and very few 19b-4s get filed and it‚Äôs a very long process.‚Äù  Normally when you‚Äôre going up against a regulator you try to take the easiest route and this is a very hard route to market. Asked why BlackRock applied despite the hard route, Barton said it wants to be first on the off-chance the pressure gets to the SEC.‚Äú  'If anyone, it‚Äôll be BlackRock'  Overwhelmingly, the experts interviewed by CoinDesk predicted that while it‚Äôll take time, and perhaps longer than the crypto community thinks, BlackRock‚Äôs best suited to be placed first in the ETF race.  ‚ÄúIf anyone's going to get approved it'll be BlackRock,‚Äù Koutoulas said. ‚Äú(Because) of BlackRock‚Äôs track record of having about 500 ETF applications approved and only one permanently rejected, and that the U.S government does so much business with BlackRock.‚Äù  Such an organization can ‚Äústand the test of time and they can work on this for years to come. They might have to tweak and adjust but eventually with the necessary financial resources, they'll get it done,‚Äù Waterman said.  While BlackRock may be considered a favorite by many, Barton points out that smaller organizations often have an advantage in being nimble.

""We regularly evaluate the results of our partnerships around the world and unfortunately, despite being offered time and opportunities, the AFA has not fully complied with its contractual obligations, which goes against our business values and our partnership principles,"" Binance said in a Spanish-language statement posted on Twitter on Monday.  In January 2022, Binance became the main sponsor of Argentina‚Äôs powerhouse national soccer team and the naming sponsor of its national soccer league in a five-year deal.  The deal was not without controversy, as AFA unilaterally terminated a contract with the fan token site Socios to sign an agreement with Binance. Afterwards, Socios sued AFA, although the company remained as the exclusive provider of AFA's official fan token, $ARG, until 2026.  The bear market and regulatory crackdown have stung all corners of the crypto markets and Binance, one of the world's largest exchanges, hasn't been spared.  Most recently, Wall Street Journal said that Binance has stopped offering certain benefits to its employees due to declining profits for the company. The report came after Binance cut more than 1,000 workers in recent weeks amid growing regulatory and legal challenges around the world, with the reported potential for more than a third of the company‚Äôs previous 8,000 employees to be cut eventually.  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Binance, Binance.US and founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao in June on allegations that the companies operated as an unregistered securities exchange, broker and clearinghouse all in one to allow U.S. customers to buy and trade certain cryptocurrencies that the regulator claimed were unregistered securities.",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Andr√©s Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/07/17/binance-ends-argentinas-soccer-association-partnership-citing-lack-of-compliance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6b4fb6d42e912a59c711e2fdc1e552dcf931c2fe-3960x2040.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

To be sure, even a continuation of recent encouraging signs, including last Wednesday‚Äôs slightly more than expected drop in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), is unlikely to stir the U.S. central bank from its plan to raise the interest rate by 25 basis points (bps). The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) begins its next two‚Äìday policy meeting, during which it will come to a rate decision, on July 25.  The FedWatch tool, which gauges sentiment about interest rate decisions, has risen above 97%, up slightly from its already lofty perch in recent weeks, and multiple bank officials have maintained that inflation remains a threat to the economy, even after halting rate increases last month. Monetary hawkishness has tended to weigh on crypto prices, raising investor angst about central bank overstep.  Read More: Bitcoin Dips Below $30K to Lowest Since Late June as Altcoins Pare Gains From XRP Lawsuit  Last week‚Äôs 3.1% reading, which continued a downward trend, left crypto markets largely unmoved (a partly favorable court decision about Ripple‚Äôs XRP had a greater impact), as did the following day‚Äôs mildly encouraging Producer Price Index (PPI) for June and a few faint signs earlier this month that the job market is cooling.  This week will include retail, industrial productivity and home sales, along with the usual weekly jobless claims.  Retail Sales, Industrial Production  On Tuesday, the U.S. Commerce Department releases June retail sales, with consensus for a 0.5% rise, up from last May‚Äôs 0.3% reading, which beat expectations. Continued growth suggests that consumers are continuing to spend on household and other goods, a sign of the sort of economic expansion that leads to higher prices.  The same day, the Fed releases Industrial Production figures that will offer an additional snapshot of economic growth in May. Industrial Production ticked down 0.2% in May after rising the previous two months.  Jobless Claims  On Thursday, the Labor Department will release weekly jobless claims. Expectations are for 240,000 unemployment claims, up from last week‚Äôs 237,000 total. The number of claims has recently been hovering comfortably above 200,000 even as observers of the unemployment market look for more sizeable increases that would indicate a cooling of the hot job market.  Existing Home Sales  Also on Thursday, the National Association of Realtors, a trade group, publishes its June report on existing home sales with expectations for the market to continue slowing. A robust housing market has contributed to inflationary pressure. In May, existing home sales inched up 0.2% but were off 20% from the previous year, same month, while the median sale price of $396,100 was down 3.1%.  Bank Earnings  The earnings season for big banks started largely favorably last week with JPMorgan Chase net income and revenue surging 67% and 34%, respectively.

""We‚Äôre pleased from that decision recognizing the importance of protecting investors on the institutional investors,"" Gensler said at an event of the National Press Club in Washington DC. ""While disappointed on what they said about retail investors, we‚Äôre still looking at it and assessing that opinion.""  Ripple scored a partial victory in its fight with the SEC last week with a court ruling that institutional sales of the tokens violated federal securities laws, but sales on exchanges and programmatic sales did not qualify as the sale of securities. That's because the SEC cannot definitively say speculative investors had ‚Äúa reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.‚Äù  Gensler declined to answer a question about what more the SEC needed to see to be confident about spot-bitcoin ETFs, citing ongoing litigation and the need for him, as SEC chair, to not prejudge the various applications in front of the regulatory body.  In response to a question that asked why the SEC seemed to regulate by enforcement instead of by rulemaking, like the European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), Gensler said ""we have done some rulemaking"" including ""notice and comment rulemaking"" and ""special purpose broker-dealer"" licensing.

15001379,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542992,1689620450,29% Of Bitcoin‚Äôs Circulating Supply Is Now Presumed Lost Forever,"According to recent findings from blockchain analytics company IntoTheBlock, around 29% of the total Bitcoin circulating supply is now presumed lost forever after remaining stagnant for over five years. Bitcoin was designed to be scarce, with only 21 million coins ever to be mined, but the very features that make the cryptocurrency so attractive to investors can sometimes lead to investors losing their assets forever, especially in cases where private keys are forgotten. Related Reading: Why Ripple‚Äôs Victory Against The SEC May Be Short-Lived: Legal Expert Stagnant BTC Addresses Are Growing Over Time In a recent tweet by IntoTheBlock, the company called attention to the high number of dormant bitcoin addresses. ‚ÄúOur data shows that 29% of $BTC hasn‚Äôt moved in over 5 years. It‚Äôs possible that a large part of this concerns lost coins,‚Äù the tweet said. BTC presumed lost crosses 7.7 million | Source: Glassnode Similar data has been supplied by Glassnode Alerts, an on-chain metrics monitor. According to Glassnode, on-chain data shows that the total quantity of HODLed or lost bitcoins just hit a new all-time high of 7,781,224.168 BTC. Given that the price of a single Bitcoin is currently about $30,000, this equates to more than $235 billion in BTC that has now been lost. What Does This Mean For Bitcoin? Institutional interest in Bitcoin has grown in the past year, with companies like MicroStrategy doubling down on their bitcoin holdings. Hence, the increase in dormant addresses can show more people are holding Bitcoin as a long-term investment rather than trading or spending it. However, it can also signal the amount of BTC lost forever, especially by early investors. BTC price trending at $30,100 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Taking into account that early investors are more likely to cash out on the huge gains made by the price of bitcoin, the latter is more likely. The price of Bitcoin has skyrocketed over the years and small amounts of Bitcoin from the early days are now worth a fortune. So if investors still had access to these dormant BTC, then they would likely have been moved already. As Bitcoin gained mainstream popularity, many people have also bought in without fully understanding how to secure their private keys properly. A good example is the case of Stefan Thomas, a San Francisco-based programmer who is unable to asses his holdings of about 7,002 bitcoins. Thomas‚Äô holdings are currently worth $216 million, but he can‚Äôt remember the password containing the private keys to his digital wallet. Related Reading: Ark Invest Sells Over $50 Million Worth of Coinbase Shares Amidst Stock Rally With bitcoin having a fixed supply, its increasing scarcity due to lost coins can also enhance its appeal as a store of value. This could drive the price up due to increasing demand for the fewer bitcoins in circulation. Bitcoin has seen a surge in price in recent months fueled by spot ETF applications filed by major investment companies like BlackRock and Valkyrie. The cryptocurrency is up by 43% this year and is currently ranging around $30,000 for the past few weeks.

The startup will use the capital toward the launch of its stablecoin and bond asset in the third quarter.  Other backers in the round included BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes and his family office, Maelstrom, and a handful of crypto derivatives exchanges, including Deribit, Bybit, OKX, Gemini and Huobi, among others.  Founded earlier this year, Ethena is working on two new products that will form a digital currency and savings platform. The fully collateralized stablecoin will have on-chain custody and settlement. The coin will maintain its peg to the US dollar by utilizing user-provided collateral to hedge the price exposure by betting against Ethereum using perpetual swaps. The setup aims to balance any losses or gains by either asset so that the stablecoin holds consistent at $1.  The second product is a digitally-native savings bond achieved through a bond token built on top of the stablecoin. The bond token functions in a similar way as a US Treasury but without the ties to a government or centralized banking institution.  ‚ÄúEthena is building the holy grail of stablecoins: a coin that is truly stable, decentralized, and capital-efficient,‚Äù said Dragonfly general partner Tom Schmidt in the press release. ‚ÄúStablecoins have grown massively in popularity over the past few years by providing access to USD-denominated savings and remittances for people around the world, but they've always been handicapped by one of these three issues.

In this article, we examine the recent price drop of Litecoin (LTC) and the surge of Tradecurve, which has remained a favorite presale among investors. >>Register For The Tradecurve Presale Litecoin (LTC) Sees a Bearish Downturn Litecoin (LTC) has witnessed a recent price drop, causing concern among its bulls. In the last week alone, Litecoin saw a drop of 14.5% on the price charts. The decline in Litecoin's value can be attributed to various factors, including overall market sentiment and profit-taking by traders. Litecoin has a value of $94.30 with a market cap of $6.9B, which is a drop of 2.43% in the last 24 hours. Not only that, the technical analysis for Litecoin also paints a bearish picture, with both its technical indicators and moving averages showing strong sell signals. To predict how the current conflict between the bulls and the bears will turn out, traders are now paying particular attention to the $90-$92 price range. If it falls below that range, Litecoin may continue dropping to its support level of $85.

42393071,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgFfbv,1689615354,Celo Proposes to Ditch Own Standalone Blockchain for Layer-2 Network on Ethereum,"CLabs, the developer behind the Celo blockchain, is proposing to transition from an independent layer-1 blockchain to an Ethereum layer-2 solution.  The team announced the proposed move over the weekend in a Twitter thread, saying it followed ""months of research and initial discussions with Celo and Ethereum community members.""  ""An indicative on-chain governance proposal (or 'temperature check) will be released for the community to vote on as early as Saturday, July 22,"" according to the thread.  The migration would initially rely on Optimism's OP Stack, which developers can use to spin up their own layer-2 chains, according to the post. Technical features would include a ""decentralized sequencer powered by Celo's existing validator set"" and ""a design retaining Celo's one-block finality.""  ""Migrating Celo to utilize the OP stack eliminates the need to monitor compatibility, making it easy for Celo developers to utilize the full gambit of Ethereum tooling / libraries,"" according to a detailed technical write-up on the Celo Forum, where members of the blockchain's community can discuss matters related to the project.  The existential change could simplify liquidity sharing between Celo and Ethereum while boosting security and facilitating a seamless developer experience, according to the post. Celo is already compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine or EVM, meaning Ethereum developers can easily port over their existing apps or can develop new ones using many of the same tools.  Ethereum currently has over $26 billion total value locked and Celo has around $99 million, according to data from DefiLlama.  Eventually, Celo might even ""upgrade to a highly scalable validium-based zkEVM,"" according to the Celo Forum post.  The proliferation of so-called zkEVMs is one of the hottest trends of the year in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. They are ZK-rollups ‚Äì layer-2 chains based on zero-knowledge proofs, an increasingly popular type of cryptography, with EVM compatibility.  For now, Celo's proposed design calls for an ""off-chain data availability, powered by EigenLayer and EigenDA, operated by Ethereum node operators, and protected by restaked ETH,"" according to the Celo Forum post.  The team added in the July 16 tweet, ""This would also make Celo the first major project with a restaking use case!""  ""Off-chain data availability solutions like EigenDA enable this to be achieved without necessitating steep increases in Celo‚Äôs transaction fees,"" according to the technical write-up on the Celo Forum. ""It is cLabs‚Äô belief that these advancements in the Ethereum-based L2 stack now have the necessary pieces in place for a Celo L2 migration to add significant value to its mission.""  CELO, the native token of the blockchain, jumped almost 10% on Monday, reaching a two-week high of $0.59. The token has gained just under 45% over the last month.  None other than Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum, added to the comments section on the Celo Forum post, writing ‚ÄúAmazing, and excited to see this!,‚Äù and he offered some technical suggestions to consider.  ‚ÄúWould love to see the Celo ecosystem come closer to Ethereum,‚Äù Buterin wrote.

42393083,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgFgRD,1689615341,Ripple's XRP Ruling Does Nothing for Regulatory Clarity,"The reaction to last week‚Äôs court ruling on the sale of Ripple‚Äôs XRP token makes no sense. After a two-year legal battle instigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, a judge ruled that XRP is an unregistered security when sold to institutional buyers but isn‚Äôt when it‚Äôs bought by anyone else.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  In 2020 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Ripple, its CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen, alleging failure to register its token XRP as a security before selling around $1.3 billion worth. What followed was years of Twitter spats and incremental legal advancements as Ripple attempted to argue how fundamentally incorrect it is to call XRP a security.  Never mind that there is a company in Ripple behind XRP, which means that one could reasonably conclude that XRP purchasers would expect to profit from the managerial or entrepreneurial efforts of the token issuers (i.e. the basic definition of a security in question). No. XRP is called a cryptocurrency and its supporters argue it cannot possibly be a security.  Read more: Philosophically, It Doesn‚Äôt Matter Whether Cryptos Are Securities; Practically, It Does | Opinion  With last week‚Äôs news, XRP unsurprisingly rallied. Its token price nearly doubled and trading volumes exploded by an eye-watering 1,351%.  But Thursday‚Äôs news has done basically nothing to make clear where crypto will stand in the eyes of U.S. law. We know where the SEC stands ‚Äì everything is a security except Bitcoin and maybe Ethereum ‚Äì but the SEC isn‚Äôt the end all be all. Now we‚Äôre in this weird world where we have a crypto asset that is an unregistered security sometimes. Sure, there‚Äôs a difference between retail and institutional buyers here since retail did not (and is not) buying XRP directly from Ripple so there cannot be an investment contract between retail investors and Ripple.  Still, I submit that this makes no sense. It‚Äôs like saying someone who buys a house as an investment is buying real estate, but a person who buys a house to live in is not buying real estate. It‚Äôs nonsense. Either XRP is a security, or it is not. These should be mutually exclusive.  So, no, JMP Securities, this is not a milestone win for the crypto industry. I know you published a research note that stated this ruling ‚Äúprovides legal clarity and defense around what does and does not constitute a security, and that overall outcome is in favor of what many in the industry had been arguing‚Äù but that‚Äôs not what was provided here at all.  Instead, the court decided that the answer to ‚Äúis this a security?‚Äù was ‚Äì like many things in finance ‚Äì ‚Äùit depends.‚Äù",NEGATIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/07/17/ripples-xrp-ruling-does-nothing-for-regulatory-clarity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f6339e879b430af91ecd09e35ae2e6f5b43ca7df-6838x3847.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Also, XRP experienced a significant surge in trading volume, reaching $10.4 billion on July 13. However, while this figure appears impressive, it is worth noting that it only ranks as the 76th largest volume in XRP‚Äôs history. This observation highlights the immense potential that XRP possesses, suggesting that the recent surge in volume may be just the beginning. A tweet from Leonidas, the host of the popular crypto YouTube channel XRPArcade, underscores this point, stating, ‚ÄúOn July 13th, XRP‚Äôs volume spiked to $10.4 billion. Even though this seems like a big number, historically, this was XRP‚Äôs 76th largest daily trading volume recorded on CoinMarketCap (CMC).

The technology ‚Äúcould promote herding with individual actors making similar decisions because they are getting the same signal from a base model or data aggregator.‚Äù  Read More: SEC's Gensler 'Disappointed' by Part of Ripple's XRP Judgement, Still Assessing Opinion  On a more granular level, Gensler said he's asked the agency's staff to recommend potential regulations addressing ways AI might be optimized to benefit intermediaries at investors' expense.  ""In finance, conflicts may arise to the extent that advisers or brokers are optimizing to place their interests ahead of their investors‚Äô interests,"" Gensler said. ""That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve asked SEC staff to make recommendations for rule proposals for the Commission‚Äôs consideration regarding how best to address such potential conflicts across the range of investor interactions.""  His speech, which did not mention the SEC‚Äôs aggressive actions against the cryptocurrency markets, comes at a time when AI innovation has accelerated, leading to calls in some corners for the tech to be regulated if not banned. The recent release of GPT-4 underscored how powerful AI tools have become, and critics have expressed fears of everything from job losses from automation to, in the most dire scenarios, human extinction.  Gensler did not spell out how he thought AI applications would figure into our global financial system, nor what decisions they might influence. Neither did he predict how far off widespread use of the technology might be.  In the financial markets, AI currently powers robo advisor-like trading programs and stock market prediction softwares, neither of which bears much resemblance to the omniscient, social order-disrupting AI popularized in movies like Her and Megan.  Still, Gensler warned that failing to regulate AI could endanger the global economy by ‚Äúexacerbat[ing] the inherent network interconnectedness of the global financial system.‚Äù  He added, ""Thus, AI may play a central role in the after-action reports of a future financial crisis.""  According to the SEC chair, risk management tools alone cannot stem the risks advanced AI tools pose to the U.S. and global financial systems.

The integration of Portal DEX will make cross-chain transactions between Bitcoin and other digital assets fast, secure, and private. With this, LFG users will be able to purchase the Ordinal NFTs and BRC-20 tokens using assets from other chains such as Ethereum without bridges or custodians. Utilizing Portal‚Äôs ‚Äúcross-chain Atomic Swaps‚Äù technology for payments in any NFT marketplace is a monumental ‚Äúfirst‚Äù in the NFT ecosystem. ‚ÄúLFG is looking for solutions that allow ETH and other NFT collectors seamless access to Ordinal trading, and we found Portal to be the best solution available. So it makes total sense to integrate Portal‚Äôs DEX protocol,‚Äù said LFG Market Co-founder Jason Rosenstein. The creation of Ordinal inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain has led to over $210 million in Ordinals trading volume, according to the latest quarterly report by DappRadar. With DEXes gaining a stronger foothold in the crypto industry, the interest in NFTs on Bitcoin is only expected to shoot up in the future. According to Nansen, 4% of the US population owns an NFT; but it was almost non-existent on Bitcoin until the Ordinals revolution in 2023. For Ordinals to truly take off as the value layer for data and information, cross-chain solutions are needed to bring the much bigger non-Bitcoin NFT audiences from across the blockchain space to access Bitcoin Ordinals with security and trust-minimization. Whether it‚Äôs Eth NFT fans or Solana NFT fans, there still is no ability to exchange their treasured NFTs in a trust-minimized way across chains. ‚ÄúBridge‚Äù solutions and wrappers are cumbersome, often custodial, and highly vulnerable to security threats. Portal‚Äôs ‚Äúcross-chain Atomic Swaps‚Äù functionality being built into LFG Market and other DEXes allows for stablecoin payments ‚Äì that today only exist on EVM-compatible chains ‚Äì seamless access to Bitcoin BRC-20 and Ordinal purchases. While the LFG Market currently accepts payments only in BTC, other tokens such as ETH, USDC, USDT, and even tokens on Layer 2 EVMs like Arbitrum and others will be accepted after integrating the Portal DEX protocol. Since Portal‚Äôs Atomic Swaps operate at Layer 2 without bridging, it is both the safest and least-expensive way to trade cross-chain. Portal is working on supporting as many compatible blockchains, wallets, and DeFi apps as possible. Portal CEO Chandra Duggirala said, ‚ÄúBased on our research, we know that marketplace and DEX operators value UX and liquidity. We've worked tirelessly to ensure that our infrastructure integrates smoothly with their existing setups, minimizing engineering overhead, while cross-chain liquidity aggregation helps them increase volumes and offer more assets and features to their users.‚Äù Portal believes that blockchains are ‚Äúspecialized‚Äù and that each chain is optimized to do one thing, at the expense of other tradeoffs. Bitcoin is purpose-designed to be sound, peer-to-peer money with superior censorship resistance. Ethereum, on the other hand, was designed for composable utility. By enabling seamless swapping of assets between incompatible chains, Portal helps aggregate liquidity across many chains, ending the fragmentation problem, and helping marketplaces like LFG and others grow their user bases and value propositions. About LFG Market LFG‚Äôs mission is to create a platform that simplifies and enhances the trading process of Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens. LFG is a seamless and efficient trading environment that enriches the digital asset ecosystem and facilitates novel financial interactions on top of Bitcoin.

A flat bitcoin Bitcoin remains in its sideways accumulation as it has done for the last three days. The market is waiting for that next big move, and whether this is to the upside or the downside is still to be decided. The fact that the king of the cryptocurrencies made another higher high is all to the good, and even if there is a dip to $28,000 or thereabouts a higher low will have easily been put in. Others.D The high end of the crypto market has had a flat day so far, but this is not the case for certain altcoins lower down. The Others.Dominance chart is the market cap of cryptos excluding the top ten cryptocurrencies. This chart is 13.3% up for the day so far compared with slightly negative percentages for other Total market caps. So with such a good move to the upside for this section of the market, which were the alts that made the most percentage gains? $SUSHI Sushi ($SUSHI), one of the main competitors to Uniswap, has put on 11.9% thus far. A double bottom looks to have been found at $0.48, and today‚Äôs rise to $0.76 has met $0.80 but has since returned to hopefully flip resistance into support at $0.76. $CELO Celo ($CELO), the mobile, carbon negative, EVM-compatible blockchain ecosystem has also risen just over 11% up to now. The decent move upwards here is probably due to the announcement that Celo devs will migrate the blockchain from a layer1 to a layer2-based on OP stack, improving security and bringing more use cases to ethereum. Celo has found its own double bottom which fell as far as $0.34.

14997600,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542973,1689611453,zkSync Unveils Boojum Upgrade: The Ultimate Solution For Scalability And Security?,"zkSync, a blockchain network that aims to make digital self-ownership universally accessible, has announced a major cryptographic upgrade to its proof system. The upgrade involves transitioning to a new STARK-based proof system called Boojum, which, according to the announcement, offers world-class proving performance and reduces hardware requirements for decentralization. zkSync Era Moves To Boojum Boojum is a Rust-based arithmetization and constraint library that implements the upgraded version of the ZK circuits for zkSync Era and the ZK Stack. The library offers several compelling properties, including PLONK-style arithmetization. PLONK-style arithmetization refers to the use of PLONK (Permutation-based Linear-based SNARKs for transparent, universal, and upgradable proofs) as the underlying zero-knowledge proof system. PLONK is a relatively new proof system that provides several advantages over previous systems, such as Sonic and Halo. Specifically, PLONK is designed to be more transparent, universal, and upgradeable, making it a good choice for zkSync‚Äôs upgraded proof system. Related Reading: Celsius Is Selling, More Pain For BNB, LINK, And SNX? According to the announcement, the move to a STARK-based proof system represents a dramatic performance improvement and will help ensure low latency for finality and support for increased levels of activity on zkSync Era and other ZK Stack-based systems. The GPU provers used for Boojum require just 16 GB (GygaByte) of RAM, a significant reduction from the hundreds of GBs of RAM needed by prevalent proof systems. By reducing the amount of RAM required to run the GPU provers from hundreds of GBs to just 16 GB, zkSync will be able to use cheaper machines for increased horizontal scalability. This will likely have a positive impact on the cost of using zkSync. This means that more people will be able to participate in the network and contribute to its decentralization, ultimately leading to a healthier and more robust network. Furthermore, to ensure a smooth transition, zkSync is running the new proof system alongside the existing one in a testing phase called mainnet shadow mode. The network is generating and verifying ‚Äúshadow proofs‚Äù for Mainnet blocks to further test and optimize the system with real production data from zkSync Era‚Äôs user activity. This testing is being done off-chain to find edge cases and bugs, and to continue reviewing the implementation. zkSync is also open-sourcing the Boojum codebase to allow anyone to use the new proofs and verify them using a command-line interface (CLI) tool. Related Reading: Polkadot (DOT) Price Momentum Builds As Open Interest Climbs ‚Äì Details The network is confident that Boojum and its commitment to innovation and user-first design are the next steps forward for a more secure, scalable, and efficient zkEVM. However, according to the announcement, the migration to the new proof system will only happen after further audits and security reviews are completed. Overall, the move to Boojum is a significant step towards a future of user-powered, decentralized proof generation. The increased performance and reduced hardware requirements will help zkSync and other ZK Stack-based systems achieve greater scalability and accessibility, making digital self-ownership more accessible to everyone.

The company‚Äôs Committee of Unsecured Creditors, representing customers owed money after its November bankruptcy, are arguing the company should be liquidated right away without further costly legal delays, and without freeing executives from future litigation risks.  The report, made in a court filing unsealed Friday, alleges that mismanagement at the company, and in particular its overexposure to failed crypto exchange FTX, exposed the company and its creditors to ‚Äúlosses of a staggering quantum,‚Äù which were not just foreseeable, but actually foreseen.  In a Nov. 2 article, CoinDesk revealed that much of the balance sheet of FTX‚Äôs hedge fund arm Alameda Research was made up of its own FTT token. That revelation was so fatal to confidence in the exchange that FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy just nine days later (the coverage also, incidentally, won CoinDesk two awards for journalism).  Yet seeing FTX‚Äôs toxic internal arrangements failed to deter BlockFi, which collapsed a few weeks after FTX, BlockFi creditors claim.  ‚ÄúBlockFi had the exact same balance sheet published by CoinDesk ‚Ä¶.before it placed any of the cryptocurrency placed on the FTX/Alameda platform in the second half of 2022,‚Äù the Friday filing by creditors said, adding that BlockFi‚Äôs investment ‚Äì including nearly $900 million re-lent to Alameda between July and September 2022 ‚Äì is ‚Äúmoney that now may be irretrievable.‚Äù  ‚ÄòYes‚Äô men  BlockFi ‚Äúfailed to complete basic due diligence‚Äù on Bankman-Fried‚Äôs empire, offering ‚Äúspecial treatment for FTT and Alameda‚Ä¶ that cast risk management principles entirely to the wind,‚Äù added the report, based on a review of 30,000 internal documents, and interviews and depositions with key individuals including founder and chief executive Zac Prince.  Warnings from BlockFi‚Äôs own internal risk committee went unheeded or were overruled by Prince, who, instead of increasing collateral requirements, said the company should ‚Äúoffer terms that we think the client [Alameda] could say yes to,‚Äù the filing said.  Blockfi had also misled investors about its risk management strategies, asset concentration and the honoring of customer withdrawals, the filing added.  Creditors have previously argued they should be allowed to file their own plans to wind up the company, accusing BlockFi management of ‚Äúextortion‚Äù by delaying proceedings to ensure they can negotiate a legal release from personal liability.  In an emailed statement, BlockFi told CoinDesk it ‚Äúdisagrees with the Committee‚Äôs report,‚Äù and cited its own July 10 filing, which said that none of BlockFi management had misused client funds for their own purposes, or directed transactions without reasonable understanding of the risk.  ‚ÄúThe Special Committee has not uncovered any evidence that the Released Parties knew, should have known, or reasonably could have known, about FTX‚Äôs and Alameda‚Äôs true nature‚Äù and any legal claims ‚Äúdo not justify prosecution from a cost/benefit perspective,‚Äù the July 10 filing on behalf of the company said.

Tokenholders were given two options: liquidate and distribute the treasury‚Äôs remaining assets or migrate to a different blockchain, rebrand and rebuild. They soundly rejected the migration plan in a lopsided vote that ended Monday.

Bitcoin Miner Reserve Has Been Declining In The Last Two Weeks As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC miner reserve has been observing outflows recently. The ‚Äúminer reserve‚Äù here refers to the total amount of Bitcoin that the miners as a whole are holding in their wallets right now. When the value of this metric goes up, it means that these chain validators are transferring coins into their addresses currently. This kind of trend can be a sign that the miners are accumulating, and hence, can be bullish for the price of the asset. On the other hand, the indicator trending down suggests the miners are taking BTC out of their wallets at the moment. Generally, these investors withdraw coins from their reserve for selling-related purposes, so such a trend can have bearish consequences for the cryptocurrency‚Äôs value. In the context of the current discussion, the miner reserve itself isn‚Äôt of interest, but rather its ‚Äúrate of change‚Äù (ROC) is. This metric keeps track of the percentage changes in the miner reserve over a specific period. Here, the relevant period is the 14-day one. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV At Critical Level: Will A Break Happen? Now, below is a chart that shows the trend in the 14-day ROC of the Bitcoin miner reserves over the last few months: Looks like the value of the metric seems to have been negative in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As shown in the above graph, the 14-day ROC of the miner reserve had been green last month as Bitcoin had rallied above the $30,000 level. These positive values of the indicator imply that the miner reserve had been rapidly going up. The timing of these positive ROC values could suggest that the accumulation from the miners might have provided support for the surge in the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price. Related Reading: Stablecoin Exchange Deposits Remain Low, What Does It Mean For Bitcoin? In the first week of this month, though, the metric turned negative, implying that the miner reserve started to decline. The miners look to have continued to withdraw coins from their wallets since then, as the indicator‚Äôs value has remained red. The Bitcoin price has been struggling in this period, as it hasn‚Äôt been able to mount up any significant moves. It would appear that this selling from the miners (if the withdrawals are indeed happening for selling) might be one of the factors behind the asset stalling in the past couple of weeks. Since the 14-day ROC of the miner reserve has continued to be at notable red values recently, it‚Äôs possible that these chain validators aren‚Äôt letting up their selling just yet. So far, the price has continued to hold on above the $30,000 level, implying that there may be enough demand in the market to absorb any selling from the miners for now. However, if the miners continue to sell into the near future, it‚Äôs possible the asset may buckle and the price could face a drawdown. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $30,000, down 1% in the last week.

42393076,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgFfrJ,1689606000,A New Uniswap Feature Aims to Eliminate DeFi Pain Points,"Uniswap, the world's largest decentralized crypto exchange, unveiled a new blockchain protocol ""UniswapX"" for trading across automated market makers (AMMs) and other liquidity sources.  Details of the project were shared with CoinDesk in a press release, and Uniswap Labs CEO Hayden Adams was due to make the announcement on-stage Monday at the EthCC conference in Paris.  Uniswap, the world's largest decentralized exchange (DEX) according to the website DefiLlama with about $3.8 billion of collateral or ""total value locked,"" says that UniswapX addresses many of the pain points of on-chain trading and self-custody swapping. Features include ""better prices"" by aggregating liquidity sources, according to the press release, along with gas-free swapping, protection against maximal extractable value, or MEV, and no cost for failed transactions.  In the coming months, UniswapX will expand to gas-free cross-chain swaps, according to the company.  Uniswap is launching UniswapX in ""opt-in beta"" on the Uniswap Labs interface for the main Ethereum network, with plans to expand to other chains and the Uniswap wallet ""in the near future."" The company didn't say when a final version would be available.  How it works  For swappers, the liquidity pools are a lifeline in executing trades on DEXs, but these pools can sometimes dry up. UniswapX looks to solve this problem by engaging with third-party fillers that fill swaps directly or route users to appropriate AMM pools. These third-party fillers would have to compete with Uniswap itself, thus driving down prices for traders.  Fillers will also cover the gas fees on behalf of swappers, eliminating the need for swappers to own a blockchain's native network token, such as ETH or MATIC, to participate in trading, and removing any financial responsibility for unsuccessful transactions.  According to Uniswap, fillers incorporate gas fees into overall swap prices, but they have the option to reduce transaction costs by aggregating multiple orders, thereby fostering a competitive environment for achieving the most favorable price.  Lastly, Uniswap promises that UniswapX will help thwart MEV ‚Äì a scheme that‚Äôs usually loathed by swappers, wherein network operators capitalize on their ability to preview queued transactions.  UniswapX addresses this issue by redirecting MEV, which would otherwise be seized by arbitrage transactions and sandwich attacks by encouraging fillers to use private transaction relays ‚Äì keeping things out of sight of MEV bots.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SPONSORED | UNI,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/07/17/uniswap-launches-cross-amm-protocol-uniswapx,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/97517f49568d980b7a61b6455598c2fdcec14aed-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

14994847,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542899,1689604233,"Stablecoin Exchange Deposits Remain Low, What Does It Mean For Bitcoin?","On-chain data shows the stablecoin exchange deposits have remained low recently. Here‚Äôs what this may mean for Bitcoin. Stablecoin Exchange Deposits Stay Low, While Withdrawals Jump As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the fact that the stablecoin exchange withdrawals have spiked while deposits have stayed low may be slightly alarming for BTC. There are two indicators of relevance here: the ‚Äústablecoin exchange withdrawing transactions‚Äù and the ‚Äústablecoin exchange depositing transactions.‚Äù As their names already imply, these metrics track the total number of withdrawals and deposit transfers, respectively, that investors of the ERC-20 stables are making right now. Generally, investors seek the safety of these fiat-tied tokens whenever they want to escape the volatility associated with the other assets in the sector. Eventually, when these holders think that the prices are right to jump back into the volatile markets, they swap their stables back for their desired cryptocurrency. These investors usually make use of centralized exchanges for this purpose. So, when the exchange withdrawing transactions are high, it can be a sign that holders are exchanging coins like Bitcoin for stablecoins right now. Related Reading: Here‚Äôs What On-Chain Data Reveals About XRP Rally On the other hand, the deposits being high can imply these investors are looking to buy volatile assets using their stables. Naturally, in the former case, Bitcoin and others may feel a bearish effect from the selling, while in the latter case, the prices might see a bullish boost. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the stablecoin exchange withdrawing and depositing transactions over the past couple of years: Looks like only one of these two metrics has had a high value recently | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the stablecoin exchange depositing transactions metric has been relatively low for a while now. This would suggest that there may not be enough demand for converting stables into other assets right now. From the graph, it‚Äôs visible that the last time the indicator spiked was back in March of this year. Following the deposits back then, Bitcoin observed a sharp rebound in its price as the rally saw a revival. The timing of these inflows might mean that it was the buying from these stablecoin holders that had provided the fuel for the BTC surge. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV At Critical Level: Will A Break Happen? In the graph, the quant has marked other similar past instances as well. It looks like the BTC price generally observes a rise after stablecoin deposits spike, given that the withdrawals are low at the same time. Recently, however, only the stablecoin withdrawals have observed a spike, implying that investors are taking these tokens away from exchanges, likely to hold onto them for extended periods in self-custody. As there aren‚Äôt any deposits happening to counteract this, the BTC price has been struggling recently. If the trend continues and more stablecoin withdrawals continue to take place, it‚Äôs possible that the cryptocurrency could take a hit in the short term.

Zero-knowledge proofs are a type of cryptographic process that allow one party to prove to another that something is true while revealing no information about the statement itself, beyond its validity. They are widely held as one of the most important advances in blockchains due to their privacy-preserving attributes.  Theorized uses of ZK proofs range from decongesting networks such as Ethereum to helping with data provenance in artificial intelligence applications. But adoption has remained low due to bottlenecks in computation, the two organizations said in the press release.  ‚ÄúThe strategic alliance between Fabric and =nil; Foundation paves the way for almost unlimited, cost-effective, and high-speed ZKP-dedicated computing power readily available, making them a viable tool for every digital transaction, cloud service, and privacy-sensitive application,‚Äù they said a press release.  The foundation launched in 2018 as a research collective before morphing into a traditional startup. In January, it raised $22 million to build a marketplace for ZK proofs and has developed a zero-knowledge Low-Level Virtual Machine (zkLLVM), which aims to streamline workloads for ZK developers.  Fabric Cryptography, based in Silicon Valley, is developing a general-purpose processor for ‚Äúnext-gen cryptography,‚Äù including ZK proofs, called the Verifiable Processing Unit (VPU), according to the release.  The virtual machine and processing unit have been made compatible with each other, such that the zkLLVM software will see ‚Äúmajor performance advantages‚Äù when running on Fabric‚Äôs hardware in order to accelerate the implementation of ZK proofs.

According to on-chain data from Lookonchain, Celsius has transferred approximately $23.5 million of various cryptocurrencies, including BNB, ZRX, LINK, BONE, and SNX, to FalconX and OKX, respectively. Different amounts of these tokens were transferred by Celsius, a move that, while it could be positive for creditors, may impact the token valuations of those projects. Celsius Selling Altcoins Lookonchain¬†revealed that Celsius moved $8.5 million worth of LINK, the native currency of Chainlink, a middleware protocol linking on-chain smart contracts to external but verified data. At the same time, it also moved $7.84 million worth of SNX, the native token of Synthetix, a protocol allowing users to trade derivatives called synths, was transferred. Celsius also went on to move $3 million worth of BNB, the coin behind the sprawling Binance ecosystem, $2.26 million worth of 1INCH, the token aggregator, and $1.9 million worth of ZRX, the token behind one of the first decentralized finance platforms, Ox Protocol. The bankrupt lender also moved $709,678 worth of FTT, the token behind the collapsed FTX exchange, to FalconX. In response, FalconX has started¬†depositing these tokens to Binance for selling.

So far, a large tranche of tokens held by Celsius has moved through FalconX. In late June, Judge Martin Glenn of the Southern District of New York¬†allowed Celsius to start converting all their tokens to either Bitcoin or Ethereum, the two currencies that would be allowed to pay back creditors. All conversions were set to begin on July 1.

For one, Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) have introduced new updates to improve their shaky position. At the same time, Tradecurve (TCRV) launch has captured a lot of attention. This new project has become an instant hit due to its uniqueness, and enormous growth potential. Its ongoing presale has broken records. >>Register For The Tradecurve Presale Cardano‚Äôs (ADA) Network Activity Falls The Cardano (ADA) community is hopeful that the recent developments in its ecosystem, including the release of a novel Dynamic P2P networking scheme, will increase the traction on the network. Dynamic P2P has been launched to bring scalability and modularity to the Cardano network. However, experts have raised concerns over the latest on-chain data related to Cardano. As per Santiment‚Äôs data, the number of daily active addresses on the Cardano network has plummeted by 71% in the past month. The social dominance of Cardano has also taken a hit. Subsequently, the exchange rate of Cardano has suffered a drop of 23% in the last 30 days. At press time, Cardano is available to change hands at $0.29. Solana (SOL) Aims To Benefit From Firedancer To get out of the clutches of bears, and prevent its price from falling further, Solana (SOL) has shifted its focus to the NFT space. This shift in focus has come as Solana has taken a dip of 11% in the past 30 days. As a result, the current exchange rate of Solana is $19.19, which is 93% below its peak of $260.06. However, the new validator client for Solana, Firedancer, is expected to provide market support to SOL. As per the data from Messari, Firedancer can lower latency times on the Solana network, enhancing DeFi maturity. This, in turn, will enable faster transaction processing on Solana, attracting more users to the network. Meanwhile, analysts have pointed out the declining TVL of Solana. Tradecurve Presale Becomes More Appealing With 50x Growth According to data, about 5 new cryptocurrencies enter the market every day, and there are more than 26,000 digital currencies in circulation. Subsequently, crypto trading has also boomed. However, existing crypto exchanges have been criticized for their high fees, limited investment options, and data insecurity. To address these issues, and meet dynamic market demands, Tradecurve (TCRV) has launched a disruptive crypto exchange. This new Web3 trading platform enables users to invest in different markets, such as forex, equity, cryptocurrency, CFDs, and more, with a single account. What is more exciting for traders is the platform‚Äôs privacy feature. It does not require users to fulfill any KYC requirements. Contrary to this, exchanges like Coinbase and Robinhood mandate users to share their private details. Additionally, the platform boasts high-leverage trading that starts from 500:1, and a VIP account service. It will also provide traders with distributed liquidity, and non-custodial storage to enhance their trading experience. The Metaverse Trading Academy is another remarkable feature of this platform. Through the academy, users can learn better and more profitable trading strategies. The presale round of the platform is live, and a TCRV token is available to purchase for $0.018, an 80% increase from the launch price. Experts forecast that the tokens will record 50x gains during the presale round, and 100 times growth after their launch on tier-1 exchanges.

InQubeta's native QUBE coin operates on a deflationary model, strategically reducing its supply to instill a sense of exclusivity and scarcity among QUBE token holders, encouraging them to hold their tokens for future gains. Holding QUBE tokens presents an opportunity to accrue 300% profits on investments due to the appreciating value of the QUBE coin throughout the presale. InQubeta's engaging NFT marketplace contributes to its potential to grow by 1000% in 2023. This virtual marketplace serves as a space for AI startups to exhibit their curated collections of popular NFTs. The unique NFTs attract QUBE investors to actively support their preferred AI startups by purchasing NFT assets. As an incentive, AI startups can offer discounts on products and services or rewards as equity-based NFTs, further solidifying InQubeta's reputation as one of the best DeFi investment prospects. Bitcoin (BTC) Rises in Value Following a Surge in Accumulation Bitcoin utilizes its native BTC token to enable secure peer-to-peer transactions. Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has gained immense popularity as a pioneering crypto project many cryptocurrencies imitate. Between late June and July 4, 2023, whales and institutional investors in the BTC cryptocurrency actively amassed billions of dollars of Bitcoin at an accelerated pace. Their holdings ranged from 10 to 10,000 BTC, totaling over 154,600 BTC and yielding over $4.7 billion. This surge in accumulation occurred after BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, filed for a spot in the Bitcoin project's exchange-traded fund (ETF). Afterward, the BTC token recorded heightened trading activity, propelling the price of each Bitcoin to rise above $31,000, reaching a new yearly high. Renowned crypto analyst Willy Woo has speculated that this progressive price trend may lead to the value of the BTC token possibly surpassing $300,000 in the future. Conclusion Investors and enthusiasts in the DeFi market are intrigued by the rapid accumulation of Bitcoin by whales and institutional investors and the promising growth of InQubeta's QUBE coin. The influx of billions of dollars into Bitcoin's funding showcases the continued interest and confidence in the leading cryptocurrency, with price predictions reaching new highs. Conversely, InQubeta's unique combination of crypto, profitability, and AI technology positions it as one of the best DeFi cryptocurrencies, with a projected growth of 1000% in 2023.

14993368,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/fsb-publishes-recommendations-for-global-regulatory-framework,1689600405,FSB Publishes Recommendations for Global Regulatory Framework,"The Financial Stability Board (FSB) published its finalized global regulatory framework for crypto assets. On Monday, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) published its recommendations for a global regulatory framework for crypto-assets to ‚Äúpromote the comprehensiveness and international consistency of regulatory and supervisory approaches.‚Äù FSB Bases Framework on Principle of ‚ÄúSame Activity, Same Risk, Same Regulation‚Äù The FSB is an international organization that monitors the global financial system. The organization published guidelines for a global approach to crypto-related activities. The board was tasked by the Group of 20 Nations (G20) to coordinate the delivery of an effective regulatory, supervisory and oversight framework for crypto-assets in light of recent events that took place in the digital asset industry. The G20 previously said in a document summarizing the outcomes of meetings held with finance ministers and central bank governors that the FSB, IMF (International Monetary Fund), and BIS (Bank for International Settlements) are to deliver papers and recommendations establishing standards for a global crypto regulatory framework. The FSB‚Äôs document consists of two sets of recommendations: high-level recommendations for crypto regulation in general and ‚Äúrevised high-level recommendations‚Äù for a ‚Äúglobal stablecoin.‚Äù FSB Maintains Respect for Privacy According to the FSB‚Äôs recommendations, crypto platforms must segregate clients‚Äô digital assets from their own funds and must clearly separate their functions to avoid conflicts of interest. Regulators are responsible for ensuring tight cross-border cooperation and oversight. Despite stricter oversight measures, the FSB respects the principle of privacy. The international organization demands local regulators to ensure that there is no activity that ‚Äúmay frustrate the identification of the responsible entity or affiliated entities.‚Äù the regulator points to DeFi protocols in its recommendation of privacy and states: Authorities should have access to the data as necessary and appropriate to fulfil their regulatory, supervisory and oversight mandates. FSB Requires Stablecoin Issuers to Have At least One ‚ÄúGovernance Body‚Äù In its guidelines, the FSB addressed global stablecoin arrangements (GSCs) across jurisdictions to address their potential risks at a domestic and international level while supporting responsible innovation and providing adequate flexibility for jurisdictions to implement domestic approaches. The board mandates any stablecoin issuer to have one or more identifiable and responsible individuals or legal entities it calls a ‚Äúgovernance body.‚Äù It further requires issuers to maintain minimum reserve assets at a 1:1 ratio unless the issuer ‚Äúis subject to adequate prudential requirements‚Äù equivalent to commercial bank standards. The FSB also introduced a potential obligation for ‚Äúglobal stablecoin‚Äù issuers to obtain a permit to operate in each jurisdiction. Guidelines state: Authorities should not permit the operation of a GSC arrangement in their jurisdiction unless the GSC arrangement meets all of their jurisdiction‚Äôs regulatory, supervisory, and oversight requirements, including affirmative approval. Implementation of Recommendations To Be Reviewed by End 2025 The guidelines published by the FSB make up the first part of a global crypto framework, with further guidance from the IMF and BIS to come. The FSB and the IMF will jointly submit ‚Äúa synthesis paper integrating the macroeconomic and regulatory perspectives of crypto assets‚Äù in September 2023. The IMF will also independently report on the ‚Äúpotential macro-financial implications of the widespread adoption‚Äù of CBDCs. At the same time, the BIS will provide a report on analytical and conceptual issues and possible risk mitigation strategies related to crypto assets. The FSB said it will review the state of implementing its recommendations worldwide by the end of 2025. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42393103,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgFr6r,1689597337,First Mover Americas: BNB Is Being Heavily Shorted,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk‚Äôs daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Traders in the perpetual futures market tied to the BNB token are leaning bearish as the embattled cryptocurrency faces a challenging environment on multiple fronts. Data tracked by Coinglass show open interest and volume-weighted funding rates in perpetual futures have slipped to -0.18%, the lowest since late April. Those numbers mean shorts, or positions that profit from a price drop, are dominant, and are willing to pay longs to keep their bearish bets open. Funding rates are charged every eight hours. ""BNB is being heavily shorted,"" Huff Haus, co-founder of Pear Protocol, said, referring to the deeply negative funding rates.  The native token of decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator 1inch (1INCH) rose by more than 58% early Monday before giving back most of the gains. Trading volume hit $597 million, its highest level since October, 2021. At press time 1INCH was higher by about 10% over the past 24 hours. Coupled with a spike in trading volume, $3.37 million in leveraged 1inch short positions have been liquidated over the past 24-hours, according to CoinGlass. While there was no immediate catalyst evident, 1inch's rally appears to be a continuation of the uptrend begun following‚Äôs XRP supposed legal victory against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last week. XRP nearly doubled that day, leading a rally in the altcoin sector that included sizable gains for tokens like Solana‚Äôs (SOL), Cardano‚Äôs (ADA) and Polygon‚Äôs (MATIC).  The Bitcoin hashrate continues to hit all-time highs as competition between miners escalates ahead of the next halving event, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report Thursday. Expected to take place in the second quarter of 2024, the halving will reduce issuance rewards to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC, ‚Äúimplying a reduction in miners‚Äô revenues, effectively increasing Bitcoin‚Äôs production cost at the same time,‚Äù the report said. ‚ÄúWhile Bitcoin halving is seen as having a positive effect on the bitcoin price given the production cost acted historically as a floor, it poses a challenge for bitcoin miners,‚Äù analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  Chart of the Day  CELO, the native token of the EVM-compatible blockchain Celo, rose more than 7% early Monday, reaching a two-week high of $0.59.  Over the weekend, cLabs, the core developer of Celo blockchain, submitted a proposal to transition from an independent layer-1 blockchain to an Ethereum layer 2 solution.  The move would simplify liquidity sharing between Celo and Ethereum while boosting security and facilitating a seamless developer experience, the proposal said.  Post transition, CELO token will remain the native cryptocurrency and will be used to pay gas fees.

In addition, the recent legal victory of Ripple against the US Securities and Exchange Commission triggered a positive response across the entire market, benefiting not only significant cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) but also altcoins in general. Nevertheless, it is essential to note that Bitcoin and Ether experienced notable downward corrections in the short term after they attempted to surge higher last week. As a result, there might be some selling pressure soon for these leading cryptocurrencies, which could potentially harm the price of DOT. Given this scenario, how can DOT bulls regain control and overcome a potential market correction? DOT Price Update: Minor Dip, But Open Interest Improves The latest update on¬†DOT‚Äôs price from CoinGecko shows that it currently stands at $5.30. While the cryptocurrency experienced a slight decline of 1.7% over the past 24 hours, it still managed to maintain a seven-day rally of 4.8%. However, a closer analysis of the DOT price report shows some concerning indicators. Source: Coingecko According to a report, by mid-June, the Open Interest had significantly diminished compared to its April levels, signaling a bearish sentiment. However, as the month advanced, a reversal in this trend emerged. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Encounters Familiar Resistance, Prompting Concerns About Bull Run Source: Coinglass/AMBCrypto The declining Open Interest in April, which refers to the number of open contracts in the market, served as an early indicator that hinted at the forthcoming bearish sentiment. As traders and investors reduced their positions and interest waned, it reflected a growing caution and skepticism in the market. This downward trend in Open Interest implied a decrease in market participation and a potential lack of confidence in the prevailing bullish trends. Related Reading: USTC Surprises With Nearly 60% Rally ‚Äì What‚Äôs Going On? However, as June unfolded, a gradual and encouraging shift in market sentiment began to take shape. Market participants started to exhibit a more optimistic outlook, which was reflected in the increasing Open Interest. This surge in OI suggested renewed interest and activity, as traders and investors re-entered the market and established new positions. DOT market cap currently at $6.3 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Polkadot Potential Rebound Tied To Bitcoin‚Äôs Resilience On the other hand, if¬†BTC can stabilize or even climb back above $31,000, DOT will likely follow suit. The correlation between BTC and altcoins like DOT has been a well-established trend in the cryptocurrency market. BTC, the dominant cryptocurrency and a significant influencer of market sentiment, often sets the tone for the overall market direction. If Bitcoin regains stability and exhibits a bullish move, it tends to ignite a favorable view among traders and investors. This positive sentiment, in turn, could extend to altcoins like DOT. DOT seven-day price movement. Source: CoinMarketCap Therefore, for DOT bulls looking to reclaim their yard and counteract the potential negative impact of a market correction, monitoring BTC‚Äôs performance closely becomes crucial. If Bitcoin can stabilize or, ideally, recover above the significant resistance level of $31k, it would likely create a favorable environment for DOT to regain momentum.

14990962,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/bitcoin-lightning-network-now-live-on-binance,1689594420,Bitcoin Lightning Network Now Live On Binance,"Binance has successfully integrated Bitcoin Lightning Network on its platform for faster BTC withdrawals and deposits. Binance Integrates Bitcoin Lightning Network Binance, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has achieved a significant milestone by successfully integrating the Bitcoin Lightning Network on its platform. Around the end of June, the company had announced its decision to integrate the Bitcoin Lightning Network to scale up its BTC transaction. Earlier today, the Binance team put out a statement on its website, announcing the successful integration and providing all the details users would need to access these transactions. Binance users will now be able to now conduct BTC deposits and withdrawals on the Lightning Network, opening up new possibilities for faster and more cost-effective transactions. How Does Lightning Network Work? The Bitcoin Lightning Network serves as a layer-two scaling solution that operates on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Its primary objective is to enhance transaction speed, reduce fees, and address scalability concerns. By creating off-chain transaction channels, the Lightning Network facilitates near-instantaneous and economically viable transactions for users. With the completion of the integration, Binance users can locate their designated Bitcoin deposit addresses specifically tailored for the Lightning Network. These unique deposit addresses can be found on the platform's Deposit Crypto page. Lightning Network Advantages The Bitcoin Lightning Network offers several advantages over traditional on-chain transactions, primarily by alleviating congestion on the Bitcoin blockchain and enabling a higher number of transactions per second. By moving most transactions off-chain, the Lightning Network significantly enhances the scalability of the Bitcoin network. Because Lightning Network transactions do not require confirmation by miners, it is conducive to near-instantaneous payment settlements. Users can enjoy the convenience of transactions being processed within seconds or even milliseconds, further enhancing the user experience. Furthermore, transactions on the Bitcoin Lightning Network typically incur lower fees than those executed directly on the Bitcoin network. This cost reduction makes microtransactions economically viable and encourages broader adoption across various use cases. In addition to its speed and cost advantages, the Lightning Network provides enhanced privacy protection. By not revealing individual transaction details on the blockchain, the Lightning Network safeguards users' privacy, ensuring a secure and confidential transaction environment. This move from Binance underscores its commitment to embracing innovative solutions that enhance cryptocurrency functionality and usability. By leveraging the Lightning Network's advantages, Binance aims to improve the efficiency and speed of Bitcoin transactions, thereby offering users a more streamlined trading experience.

It also explained that the change in the role of Ebix Payment Services after amendments to its contracts with prepaid payment instruments (PPI) issuers for future periods requires Ebix Payment Services' future financial statements to be recorded on a net basis.

The stock's decline has since narrowed to a 13% drop at 7:37 AM ET. On Friday, after the close of U.S. markets, Ebix ( EBIX ) said Ebix Payment Services had received a ""letter of displeasure"" from the Reserve Bank of India dated March 21, 2023, regarding certain co-branding arrangements with EbixCash with the banks for the issuance and operation of PPI. Because of the RBI's directive, Ebix Payment Services will no longer be a principal under the amended co-branding arrangements as of the financial year starting April 1, 2023. Saturday's clarification pointed out that there has been no restatement of the U.S. GAAP financials or the Indian Statutory Audited Financials for any of the previous periods.

14990573,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542925,1689593429,Big Bitcoin Move Ahead: Bollinger Bands See Extreme Squeeze,"Since the Bitcoin price reached a new yearly high of $31,840 last week, only to invalidate the bullish breakout within a few hours and fall towards $30,000, there has been a strange tranquility in the market. Already since June 23, BTC has been in the trading range between $29,800 and $31,300, with every breakout attempt to the upside and downside having failed within a very short period of time. However, one of the most prominent technical indicators, the Bollinger Bands, predict that this calm may soon be over. Created by the esteemed trader John Bollinger, these bands provide invaluable insights into market volatility and potential price levels. Bollinger Bands Predict Big Move For Bitcoin The Bollinger Bands consist of three distinct lines on a price chart: the middle band, the upper band, and the lower band. The middle band is a simple moving average (SMA) that represents the average price over a specified period. The upper and lower bands are derived from the middle band, with the upper band usually set two standard deviations above the SMA, and the lower band set two standard deviations below it. Related Reading: $18 Billion Worth Of Bitcoin Accumulated At $30,200 ‚Äì BTC Bull Run Incoming? The primary purpose of the Bollinger Bands is to measure market volatility. When the price of an asset experiences significant fluctuations, the bands widen, indicating increased volatility. Conversely, during periods of reduced price movement, the bands contract, indicating lower volatility. This contraction is commonly referred to as a ‚Äúsqueeze,‚Äù where the upper and lower bands come closer together, forming a narrowing price channel. When the Bollinger Bands squeeze, the potential for a significant price movement looms. The squeeze suggests that the market is in a state of temporary equilibrium, akin to a coiled spring ready to release its stored energy. The direction of the breakout determines whether it‚Äôs a bullish or bearish signal. Up Or Down? Glassnode, a respected on-chain data provider, highlighted today the current state of the Bitcoin market, noting a remarkably low volatility environment. The 20-day Bollinger Bands are experiencing an extreme squeeze, with a mere 4.2% price range separating the upper and lower bands. This suggests that Bitcoin is currently in a period of limited price movement, ‚Äúmaking this the quietest Bitcoin market since the lull in early January.‚Äù As Bitcoin investors may remember, the Bollinger Bands squeeze in January marked the end of a lengthy downtrend. After the FTX collapse, the BTC market was in a state of shock paralysis, which was ultimately resolved by Bollinger Bands squeeze, leading to a 42% price increase in 26 days. Related Reading: Perfect Storm: Why Bitcoin & Crypto Are Poised For A Dramatic Recovery The Bollinger Bands‚Äô squeeze, combined with diminishing trading volumes, creates a scenario of mounting pressure in the Bitcoin market. As trading volume declines, the potential energy stored in this coiled spring intensifies. According to the analysts at CryptoCon, the bullish scenario is the one to be favored at the moment. ‚ÄúWhen Bitcoin volatility gets low in a bear market, it‚Äôs very bearish. When volatility gets low in a bull market, it‚Äôs insanely bullish,‚Äù the analysts say. As Bitcoin is unanimously seen to be at the start of a new bull market, a strong move to the upside could be in store.

National Australia Bank (NAB) announced Monday that it had blocked some payments to ‚Äúhigh-risk‚Äù crypto exchanges over the past few months to protect its customers. The lender said Australians lost around $151 million last year due to crypto-related scams. The NAB did not disclose which platforms it involved. NAB Halts Millions in Payments Between March and July In a statement, the NAB said it ‚Äúintervened‚Äù in more than AU$270 million worth of payments which raised concerns over scams in the past four months between March and July. The bank said it introduced several measures to protect its customers from scams. Chris Sheehan, the NAB‚Äôs Executive for Group Investigations and Fraud, said: Introducing payment prompts, taking action on spoofing and stopping the use of links in unexpected text messages are among key measures we‚Äôve introduced recently. We‚Äôre now also taking action to block some payments to high-risk cryptocurrency exchanges in a further effort to stop scammers. He added: ‚ÄúWhile many customers ultimately complete their payment after receiving a prompt, we‚Äôre seeing around $290,000 worth of payments abandoned daily. This tells us that customers are taking the time to stop and think before they make a payment. While we‚Äôre focused on making banking simple and digital, we‚Äôve added this extra friction to help alert customers to warning signs. We need to do everything we can to stop the crime before it happens.‚Äù Australian Banks Become Stricter to Prevent Customers Falling Victim to Scams The NAB joins the Commonwealth Bank of Australia to restrict customer payments to ‚Äúcertain‚Äù exchanges due to crypto-related scams. The NAB further said in its statement that almost 50% of scam funds reported to the Australian Financial Crimes Exchange were linked to crypto in a recent 30-day period. Mr Sheehan noted: These scammers are part of organized, transnational crime groups. Increasingly, we‚Äôre seeing them use cryptocurrency platforms to send stolen funds quickly and often overseas.

42393090,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgFq2B,1689591204,EU's Data Act Final Draft Still Contains Controversial Smart Contract Kill Switch,"A final version of new European Union Data Act rules largely ignores pleas from the blockchain industry, which worries they could make most smart contracts unlawful, according to a text seen by CoinDesk.  Provisions intended to ensure automated data-sharing agreements contain a kill switch under which they can be safely terminated still refer broadly to ‚Äúsmart contracts,‚Äù and aren‚Äôt limited to privately owned and permissioned data records as lobbyists hoped, a July 7 version of the law indicates.  Negotiators said they had struck a deal on the controversial text on June 28, shortly after organizations linked to numerous blockchains, including Stellar, Polygon, NEAR and Cardano, expressed their concerns in an open letter, but no text has been released until now.  The text of the law sent to CoinDesk under EU freedom of information laws still refers to ‚Äúsmart contracts‚Äù rather than the industry‚Äôs preferred formulation of ‚Äúdigital contracts.‚Äù  The text also puts duties on ‚Äúvendors‚Äù of the automated programs ‚Äì despite lobbyists‚Äô fears that the wording could impose a ‚Äúperpetual and limitless responsibility‚Äù in decentralized cases where there‚Äôs no single seller.  The text has changed from the European Commission's original February 2022 proposals to clarify that the rules apply only when programs are used for ‚Äúautomated execution‚Äù of data-sharing agreements that might be made for smart devices like connected cars and fridges. Yet the scope does not refer to private or permissioned networks, so still appears to be wider than lobbyists had requested.  The text, circulated privately to the bloc‚Äôs member governments by Spain, which is currently chairing talks, shows the law ‚Äúupdated according to the provisional political agreement reached‚Äù at a June 27 meeting, which it says ‚Äúcame to an agreement on all political issues and successfully closed the negotiations‚Äù in talks with lawmakers at the European Parliament.  In a statement issued Monday after publication of this story, signatories to the industry open letter said they ""regret"" that the regulation still covers smart contracts, rather than digital contracts, as the ""distinction between the two terms is significant.""  ""We remain cautious about potential unintended implications in future regulatory proposals,"" the statement said, adding that ""forcing an intermediary in a disintermediated environment does not necessarily enhance technology security but introduces new risks.""  To pass into law, the text must be formally agreed by the parliament and then by governments, who meet in a body known as the Council of the EU.  Signatories to the June open letter said the plans could prove unworkable and betray the purpose of permissionless networks where nobody is in charge. The commission has denied it would make existing contracts illegal.

Since then, the AR gaming genre has grown to encompass quite a few fresh ideas. AR games work by using the device‚Äôs camera to superimpose 3D graphical elements onto the real world, as viewed on its display. The idea is to incorporate the user‚Äôs physical surroundings into the gameplay, creating a surreal mixed reality experience. AR games involve mapping the user‚Äôs surroundings in order to overlay 3D virtual objects onto it. In the case of Pokemon Go, it meant users could get out and about, exploring their town or city in order to hunt for collectible Pokemon creatures. One key advantage of AR games is that they can be played on even the cheapest mobile phone, so there‚Äôs no need to invest in an expensive and bulky VR headset. Simply grab your phone, switch the game on and explore your surroundings to try and complete the objectives. The potential of AR games has yet to be fully realized, but developers have already created lots of highly original apps to enhance our experiences in the physical world. Here‚Äôs some of the hottest new AR games you can try today! Angry Birds AR: Isle of Pigs This is pretty much as you would imagine an augmented reality version of the popular Angry Birds game to be. Launch the game and it sets up a structure on a nearby table that can be viewed through your phone‚Äôs camera. Then, you use a slingshot to shoot those colorful, loveable Angry Birds at the structure in an attempt to destroy it and kill those nasty green pigs hiding inside. There are 70 different levels on the game, and many of the original characters from the popular franchise appear in it. The game is a couple of years old, but it works well and provides a very different and entertaining take on the classic Angry Birds experience. Ingress Prime Created by Niantic, the developer of the original AR hit Pokemon Go, Ingress Prime is widely considered to be one of the best AR games ever made. In the game, the discovery of an unknown, transdimensional force known as Exotic Matter by a team of scientists at CERN resulted in the creation of two factions, the Enlightened and the Resistance. The Enlightened faction seeks to harness and embrace the power of XM to transcend humanity to a higher dimension. Meanwhile the Resistance sees XM as humanity‚Äôs biggest threat, and is sworn to defend mankind by resisting the efforts of the Enlightened faction. Ingress Prime uses your device‚Äôs GPS to locate and interact with ‚Äúportals‚Äù in real-world locations, found at points of interest where human creativity is expressed, such as statues, monuments, unique architecture and historic buildings. Players choose a faction then use the map to find nearby portals, and are tasked with ‚Äúhacking‚Äù them and building them up so the other team can‚Äôt get them. The game uses the portals as elements of a science fiction backstory along with a continuous open narrative provided through various forms of media. Peer Launching this summer, Peer is the creator of a unique social network that‚Äôs overlaid onto the real world, where users can explore physical locations and find information and digital objects amid their surroundings. It‚Äôs an extremely ambitious project that aims to bring AR to the masses by overlaying 3D graphics atop of the entire world. In some ways, it can be considered an enhanced version of Google Maps, enabling users to search for nearby restaurants for example. When they arrive at their chosen restaurant to grab a bite to eat, they may be able to pick up a coupon placed outside by the restaurant owner, entitling them to a free coffee. Peer can also be used by creators, such as NFT artists, tasking people to visit different locations to mint digital collectibles. Alternatively, a dinosaur museum can create huge, 3D dinosaurs that roam around the physical world outside their premises, enticing people to come and visit its exhibits. Jurassic World Alive Staying with the dinosaur theme, Jurassic World Alive enables players to get outside in the real world searching for various dinosaurs they need to collect. In some ways it‚Äôs similar to Pokemon Go, with users having to search different locations to discover the most difficult to find dinosaurs. Once they collect a dinosaur, they can train it and breed it to create hybrid dinosaurs, and then use them to fight battles with other players nearby. While the game initially had a few bugs, the developer has seemingly ironed most of them out and it has built up a loyal player base. Players can even subscribe to the game to earn rewards, instead of spending money on in-app purchases. Zombies, Run! The extremely original Zombies, Run! is not so much a game as a gamified fitness app that uses AR to simulate zombies and scare people into running away from them. To play the game, you‚Äôll need some earbuds or headphones to listen to the audio as it narrates the story and tasks you with completing various missions while you're out and about on your daily jog. As the story progresses, there will be occasional interruptions by flesh-eating zombies that jump out of the shadows and chase after you, forcing you to start sprinting to outrun them. The game also works just as well on a treadmill. Zombies, Run! cleverly merges AR elements with an enthralling audio story to motivate people to keep moving and it has proven incredibly effective and popular. The first four missions are available to play for free, and new ones can be unlocked either by paying for them, or by completing various challenges each week.

Coupled with a spike in trading volume, $3.37 million in leveraged 1inch short positions on have been liquidated over the past 24-hours, according to CoinGlass.  Whilst there is no immediate news catalyst for the move, 1inch's rally appears to be continuing the uptrend that XRP set after it claimed a legal victory against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last week. XRP rose by 102% in one day, prompting further moves in assets like solana (SOL), cardano (ADA) and polygon (MATIC).  The open interest, which measures the nominal amount of open derivatives positions, has risen from $14 million to $125 million across 1inch trading pairs, according to Coinalyze, suggesting that the rally has been spurred by futures markets.  This creates a fragile market dynamic as market depth, a metric used to assess liquidity over a 2% spread, remains relatively low compared to trading volume. Buy-side market depth of 1inch on Binance is currently $226,272, according to CoinMarketCap. Spot sellers can capitalize on the leveraged trading activity to prompt a cascade of long position liquidations.  One particular 1inch investor appears to be deploying that trading strategy, with blockchain sleuth lookonchain noting that an investor sent 7 million tokens worth $3.7 million to Binance with price proceeding to fall by 4.4% in the following minutes.  1inch is currently trading at $0.505, it remains up by 23.8% in the past 24-hours despite losing some of its gains on Monday morning.

Gnosis announced Monday it is releasing Gnosis Pay and Gnosis Card, the first decentralized payment network integrating with a traditional payment processor and the first Visa-certified consumer debit card directly connected to an on-chain self-custodial wallet, according to a Gnosis press release.

14987474,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542858,1689585594,"$18 Billion Worth Of Bitcoin Accumulated At $30,200 ‚Äì BTC Bull Run Incoming?","A record 592,000 Bitcoin, or roughly $17.8 billion, was accumulated when the coin was trading at $30,200, recent Glassnode data indicates. At this accumulation rate, suggesting possible demand, more entities bought more coins at the second fastest pace in the network‚Äôs history. This record was only broken when 637,000 BTC were bought at an average price of $16,500. 592,000 Bitcoin Bought At $30,200 The spike in Bitcoin accumulated at this price point preceded the decision by a United States court to rule that XRP, an altcoin issued from the XRP Ledger (XRPL), is a commodity, just like Bitcoin. The ruling on Friday, July 14, was received positively by the crypto community and temporarily lifted prices, sustaining Bitcoin above the psychological $30,000 mark. According to Glassnode, the Bitcoin Entity-Adjusted Economic Ratio Per Day (ERPD) is a metric designed to assess economic activity within the network, considering the number of entities participating. This metric is calculated by dividing the Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio by the entity-adjusted on-chain volume. In on-chain analysis, the NVT ratio represents the relationship between the market capitalization and the recorded on-chain trading volumes at a specific price point. A higher NVT ratio indicates a greater value than recorded trading volumes. Related Reading: Synthetix (SNX) Up By 35% In Anticipation Of New Decentralized Exchange While the NVT reading can be useful, it can also be misleading if the entities, or clustered addresses, involved in transactions are not accounted for. To correct this error, the ERPD integrates addresses involved at that price point, used in taking account of the market cap. This way, it can be easy to gauge the entities and total coins involved. Shifting Sentiment? The surge in Bitcoin ERPD development will also likely impact altcoins. Considering its liquidity and support across the board, Bitcoin sets the tone for other altcoins in crypto. Its performance and transactions can gauge market-wide sentiment, which might, in turn, change how altcoins are perceived in the current market conditions. Related Reading: Stablecoin TrueUSD To Be Fully Controlled By Asian Owner Still, some commentators on Twitter were unsure if the metric was a positive development or a position for further price crashes. One¬†believes¬†that most such transactions are conducted by ‚Äúpaper hands‚Äù who buy Bitcoin when the price increases and are set to sell at any moment of negative news. The spike in ERPD is also ahead of the Bitcoin halving event in 2024, which, reading on historical performances, may impact prices positively, even triggering a bull run. After halving, miners would receive fewer coins, releasing even fewer for circulation, a supply shock that may support prices.

A rival reserve currency The hegemony of the US dollar as the world‚Äôs reserve currency has remained intact since the Bretton Woods agreement in 1944. However, the average citizen in the West is probably not aware that a group of countries termed the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) is about to announce a new rival reserve currency, with the likelihood that it will be backed by gold. The announcement is expected to take place at the BRICS summit, in late August, only a matter of weeks away, and none of the mainstream media outlets in the West have reported on what has the potential to be the biggest monetary change since Bretton Woods. Backlash against the dollar The weaponisation of the dollar in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine was seen by many countries as a move that could potentially be used against them in the future, and so a move away from the dollar has begun. This rebellion against US hegemony has undoubtedly been led by Putin, but has the backing of the other BRICS nations and countries that are in the process of joining them, including Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf Cooperation Council among others. Gold backing Originally, the BRICS currency was to be backed by a basket of commodities, which included gold, but according to Alistair Mcleod, Head of Research at GoldMoney.com, this would probably not work, and therefore gold on its own is likely to be that backing. Therefore, the flow of gold from West to East over recent decades can certainly be accounted for, along with the increase of gold mining production in China and Russia. With as many as 41 countries either joining or expressing interest in joining the BRICS trading bloc, the combined populations and GDP would be equal to more than half of the world and would be far bigger than that of the Western alliance. The West needs to wake up This introduction of a new rival reserve currency is not likely to usurp the dollar‚Äôs position any time soon. However, the attraction of a currency that is actually backed by a real asset, instead of the dollar, which is printed out of thin air and has no backing at all, might be anticipated to grow steadily over time. Such a development should greatly alarm the West. Media blackouts on the situation should not be the alternative to free and open dialogues on such a critical evolution in the global monetary system.

With .eth domain endings, holders will be able to house their digital identity on the Ethereum blockchain. For those unfamiliar with .eth domains, the simplest way to think of them is that they take your long wallet address (i.e. 0x74Fe1103d28fb79F4d83800003983390Dfc61234) and let you register a simpler name like ‚Äúme.eth‚Äù  See Also: What Is Decentralized Identity?  Unstoppable aims to bring new users to .eth by offering them for sale on the same platform they already offer .crypto, .nft and .polygon domain endings.  The company is rolling out additional features to ease ownership of .eth domain names, such as offering auto-renewal for Ethereum-based domains, so users don‚Äôt have to remember to renew their domain ending at its expiry and risk the loss of a highly-coveted domain name.  It's also implementing a vault to custody buyers‚Äô domains before they connect them to their wallets and will support fiat payments allowing customers to buy the domain endings with credit cards, PayPal, Apple Pay or Google Pay as well as with cryptocurrencies.  With 3.6 million registered Unstoppable Domains and 2.7 million ENS domain holders, the two providers are leading the industry in digital identity preservation. Matt Gould, CEO and Co-Founder of Unstoppable Domains told CoinDesk that making it easy for new users to buy .eth domains will draw customers who aren‚Äôt Web3 natives.  ‚ÄúPeople want to have a one place to manage all their Web3 domains across all different platforms,‚Äù said Gould. ‚ÄúThey don't want to have to think about having to pay with a whole bunch of different types of cryptocurrency or having 1,000 different wallets they have to keep track of‚Ä¶that's kind of that's the experience that we're leaning into.‚Äù  While users who purchase a .eth domain from Unstoppable will be able to access ENS integrations, holders will not be able to access Unstoppable integrations at launch. Gould noted that the company is working towards developing an industry standard through its participation in the Web3 Domain Alliance, an organization that aims to help define what the future of digital indeed will look like across the crypto space.  ‚ÄúWe want to get everyone together in the same room to talk about those things that help support each other, to share tips and tricks on what's working in their communities, for how to make things move forward, and then also to set standards for the industry,‚Äù said Gould.  Unstoppable has been busy in the bear market, penning partnerships and rolling out support for new domain endings. In February, it added crypto browser Opera-compatible domain endings .crypto and .zil. In March, it teamed up with Polygon to release .polygon domain endings, granting holders access to over 750 applications on the network.

The halving will reduce issuance rewards to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC, ‚Äúimplying a reduction in miners‚Äô revenues, effectively increasing bitcoin‚Äôs production cost at the same time,‚Äù the report said.  ‚ÄúWhile bitcoin halving is seen as having a positive effect on the bitcoin price given the production cost acted historically as a floor, it poses a challenge for bitcoin miners,‚Äù analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  Hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain such as Bitcoin.  JPMorgan says miners with lower electricity costs will find it easier to survive, while miners with higher power costs may struggle after halving occurs.  The bank estimates that a 1 cent per kilowatt hour (kWh) change in the electricity cost could cause a $4,300 change in the bitcoin production cost. After halving, this sensitivity would double to $8,600, thereby ‚Äúincreasing the vulnerability of higher cost producers.‚Äù  The steep rise in the hashrate implies increasing competition among bitcoin miners with more mining rigs being deployed, the note said.  It is unlikely the hashrate will continue to rise at the same pace following the halving event ‚Äúwithout any sustained rise in the bitcoin price above its production cost or a large increase in transaction fees that could offset the reduction in issuance rewards,‚Äù the report added.

This crucial level has proved a formidable barrier for SHIB bulls, thwarting their attempts to increase prices. Despite recent upside movements, the resistance at this level has proven to be persistent, creating a precarious situation for the cryptocurrency. As the price of SHIB hovers in this area, the question arises: Will the selling pressure overpower the bulls‚Äô determination and cause a reversal in the price action? Shiba Inu Faces Bearish Order Block And Potential Liquidity Hunt SHIB faces a significant challenge as its December 2022 low coincides with a bearish order block (OB) ranging from $0.00000785 to $0.00000824. This particular range, as highlighted in a recent¬†SHIB price report, could serve as a stronghold for bearish sentiment in the market.

Source: Coingecko Amid recent market fluctuations, SHIB is currently trading at $0.00000788, based on data by crypto market tracker Coingecko. This reflects a decline of 3.4% over the past 24 hours.

Firstly, burning tokens plays a crucial role in reducing the overall supply of SHIB, potentially exerting upward pressure on its price. Related Reading: Dogecoin Engagement Fails To Impress, Raising Concerns About Broader Interest However, with the significant decrease in the daily burn rate, the rate at which new tokens are being removed from circulation has slowed down considerably. This could impact the potential scarcity and perceived value of SHIB in the market.

It could indicate a decreased demand for burning tokens or a temporary lull in activity within the SHIB community. Market participants and SHIB token holders will closely monitor the implications of this decline in burns on future price movements and the overall supply-demand dynamics of the cryptocurrency.

Data tracked by Coinglass show open interest and volume-weighted funding rates in perpetual futures have slipped to -0.18%, the lowest since late April. It shows shorts, or positions that profit from a price drop, are dominant, and are willing to pay longs to keep their bearish bets open. Funding rates are charged every eight hours.  ""BNB is being heavily shorted,"" Pear Protocol's pseudonymous co-founder Huf, said, referring to the deeply negative funding rates.  ""The sentiment has worsened due to the recent high-profile staff exits, inconsistencies related to BCH withdrawals from Binance.US and the pending Department of Justice case against Binance's CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao,"" Huf added. BNB is the token of the BNB ecosystem, which was created by Binance, and crypto traders generally link the token with the exchange's fortunes.  Binance, facing regulatory pressures worldwide, has laid off 1,000 or more employees in recent weeks. Early this month, three senior officials left their roles, citing CZ's handling of the DOJ investigation over possible money laundering as the reason for their exits.  Over the weekend, CZ tried to calm market nerves, calling recent layoffs involuntary terminations and dismissing the layoff figure reported by media as FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt).  ""We are still hiring,"" CZ announced in a tweet on Saturday.  Still, the market remains nervous, as evident from the deeply negative funding rates, with some observers fearing more bad news ahead.  ""24h APR -92% ~ Typically, these readings precede some bad news for Binance Wonder what's coming?"" pseudonymous trader Skew tweeted on Sunday.  The negative funding rate also shows traders are still determining whether the recent U.S. court's ruling favoring Ripple would help Binance in its fight against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Last week, in a highly anticipated ruling in the SEC's case against Ripple Labs for violating securities law through XRP sales, the District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that XRP is not a security when offered to individuals through centralized exchanges, adding that it will be treated as one when offered to institutional investors. In early June, the SEC charged Binance and Coinbase for offering unregistered securities over their platforms.  Potential for short squeeze  A short squeeze is a rapid move higher driven by bears abandoning their bearish bets. For a short squeeze to occur, the market needs to have a higher-than-usual bearish activity, as is the case in BNB perpetual futures. In such situations, a minor price bump can send bears or short sellers running to square off their positions, which, in turn, drives prices further up.  Per Skew, a move above $265 could see some short covering.  ""BNB [looks] Weak as long as price trades below $265, back above there, I could see some illiquid short covering rally. Else eventually below the monthly range low $218,"" Skew tweeted.  At press time, BNB traded at $242, according to CoinDesk data.

14984740,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542878,1689578755,Ripple Vs. SEC: XRP Investors Need To Know This Next Deadline,"In the legal battle between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the recent order granting in part and denying in part the motion for Summary Judgment by Judge Torres has left many XRP investors eagerly awaiting the next steps. To shed some light on the situation, prominent attorney Jeremy Hogan has shared his thoughts on the matter, offering valuable insights into the potential appeal process with deadlines and its implications for both parties involved. Ripple Vs. SEC: The Next Possible Deadline Hogan, a seasoned attorney with experience in appeals, cautions that appeals are typically pursued after a case is completely finished. ‚ÄúAfter the final judgment is entered, either party has 60 days to appeal,‚Äù says Hogan who emphasized that the Ripple case is not yet finalized, any potential appeal at this stage would be considered an ‚Äúinterlocutory appeal.‚Äù Related Reading: XRP Explodes With 1,300% Surge In Trading Volume As crypto Exchanges Jump On Board ‚ÄúAs far as I can see in the Rules, you have 10 days to notice an interlocutory appeal‚Äù, states Hogan. Since the Summary Judgment was issued on July 13, an appeal by the SEC or Ripple Labs would have to be filed by July 23 at the latest (or by July 24 if the deadline does not start until the following day). This means that next Monday at the latest it will become public whether one of the parties files an appeal. But an interlocutory appeal is rarely granted and generally requires compelling reasons, such as the release of significant information that could impact the case. However, Hogan points out that Judge Torres did not certify her ruling for immediate review, indicating that an interlocutory appeal might not be granted in this scenario. This suggests that the SEC and Ripple would need to wait for a final judgment before pursuing an appeal. Hogan believes that both parties might ultimately choose not to appeal for various reasons. According to the lawyer, the SEC might hesitate to appeal because, even if successful, it could potentially jeopardize their overall case. Winning the appeal would retract some unfavorable aspects of the trial-level case. However, if the SEC were to lose at the appellate level, it could set a precedent that all courts in the 2nd DCA (Second District Court of Appeals) would have to follow, amplifying the impact of their loss. Related Reading: Large Exchanges Relist XRP Following Ripple Victory Over SEC On the other hand, Hogan believes that Ripple may opt not to appeal if it can afford to pay the fine and if the ruling‚Äôs effect on its business, particularly the aspect concerning the On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) feature, is manageable. These factors, combined with the fact that Ripple secured a favorable outcome in the ruling, might dissuade them from pursuing an appeal. When considering the potential difficulties in winning an appeal, Hogan emphasizes that Judge Torres is the one who has meticulously reviewed the entire case record. This makes the appellate process inherently challenging for either party, further reducing the likelihood of an appeal. Regarding the SEC‚Äôs challenge in appealing the secondary market sales aspect, which presents a problematic area for the regulatory body, Hogan admits that he hasn‚Äôt solidified his thoughts on the matter yet. XRP Price The XRP price has taken a breather after the stunning rally following the Ripple summary judgment. After being rejected at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.93, the XRP price is currently trading at $0.7481. After a possible retest of the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.68, the impulsive move may see a continuation. The final verdict in the Ripple v. SEC case and possible appeals will certainly continue to have a strong impact on the price.

As per the Southern District of New York Court's ruling, all XRP sales fall under three buckets ‚Äì institutional sales, programmatic sales, and other distributions. While the SEC prevailed in the case of institutional sales, Ripple secured a favorable outcome regarding programmatic sales and other distributions. It should be noted that t the SEC still has the option to appeal the court's decisions in the future. The Lawmakers Respond Following the ruling, the Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Patrick McHenry (NC-10), and the Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Glenn ‚ÄúGT‚Äù Thompson (PA-15), issued a joint statement. ‚ÄúThis decision underscores the need for Congress to provide clear rules of the road for the digital asset ecosystem‚Äîit‚Äôs misguided to think otherwise. The ruling gives large institutional investors greater protections than everyday Americans. Outcomes like this happen when regulators force courts to make policy instead of Congress. Our comprehensive market structure legislation will give all investors, customers, and market participants the same longstanding protections found in traditional financial markets."" The lawmakers also noted the flaws in the Gensler-led SEC's regulatory approach since digital assets may not ‚Äúbe inherently securities, but can be offered as part of an investment contract in certain circumstances, which our legislation acknowledges."" The SEC's one-size-fits-all approach creates uncertainty and harms investors. The Lummis-Gillibrand Crypto Bill Echoing her colleagues' sentiments, Senator Cynthia Lummis urged to pass the Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act, emphasizing the need for regulatory clarity. The bill primarily aims to pass authority over crypto regulation from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to the Commodities Future Trading Commission (CFTC).

Unlike existing zero-knowledge blockchain protocols, QED has a novel state model which is horizontally scalable, meaning it is no longer limited by TPS restrictions that have previously prevented adoption of blockchain technologies in Web2 use cases such as social networks, traditional finance, and gaming. Enabled by advances in fast recursive zero-knowledge proofs, QED is able to achieve this scale without compromising security or decentralization and proves all transactions end-to-end using proof recursion (verifying a zero-knowledge proof in a zero-knowledge proof ). This process of decentralized recursive proving culminates in a single block proof that can be verified by an Ethereum smart contract, making the protocol only reliant on the Proof of Math itself, rather than an incentive based consensus system vulnerable to collusion, hacking and misaligned incentives. As the first blockchain capable of serving billions of users in a single block, QED does away with the need for a zk-VM by compiling smart contract functions directly to zero knowledge circuits, making it the first zk-Native blockchain. QED‚Äôs novel approach to ZKP allows users to prove their own transactions on their own device in milliseconds, enabling a new privacy-centric internet where transactions are private by default and sensitive data never has to leave a user‚Äôs device. With its announcement of the QED Protocol, Open Asset Standards unveiled QED's official Dapen Smart Contract IDE. With Dapen, Web2 developers can write zk Smart Contracts in the world's 2 most popular programming languages, JavaScript and Python, which have a developer market share 357 times larger than the Solidity community which only makes up a miniscule 0.1% of the world‚Äôs developers. In addition to making blockchain accessible to more developers than ever before, Dapen has integrated support for Markdown smart contracts which allow even non-technical users to write smart contracts in English using their integration with several large language AI models (LLMs) including ChatGPT. Backed by Animoca Brands' fund Sparkle Ventures whose General Partners include Sebastien Borget, Co-founder of Sandbox, and Yat Siu, Co-founder of Animoca Brands, QED is set to see major adoption within the gaming space which regularly support millions of concurrent gamers playing at once. Due to its horizontal scaling model, QED is able to add transaction processing capacity by simply adding more proving nodes to its network, allowing large-scale gaming to integrate with blockchain technologies such as dynamic NFTs for the first time. Headed up by Founder and CEO Carter Feldman, a former childhood hacking prodigy and reverse engineer, the QED core team is made up of a diverse team from both Web2 tech giants and Web3 titans including Binance, reflecting the protocol's mission to unite Web2 and Web3. About QED QED is the world's first zk-Native blockchain protocol, built to scale trustless computation and privacy for the next generation of the internet.

42393101,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgFqwb,1689577200,Financial Stability Board Calls for Tougher Global Crypto Rules After Year of Turmoil,"International standard-setters on Monday called for tougher rules on safeguarding crypto clients‚Äô assets and avoiding conflicts of interest, after multiple allegations of bad behavior emerged during crypto‚Äôs recent turbulent year.  The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which groups regulators from some two dozen jurisdictions, including the U.S., EU, China and the U.K., published recommendations to ensure ‚Äúconsistent and comprehensive‚Äù regulation of the sector. The recommendations build on proposals originally floated in October and are focused on preventing the kind of behavior alleged to have been carried out by companies such as FTX and Celsius.  ‚ÄúThe events of the past year have highlighted the intrinsic volatility and structural vulnerabilities of crypto-assets and related players,‚Äù said the document, unveiling new norms which could see major crypto conglomerates forced to separate some of their activities and functions.  FTX, which filed for bankruptcy in November, has been hit by a wave of allegations of poor record-keeping and misuse of customer funds. Meanwhile, Celsius co-founder and ex-CEO Alex Mashinsky was arrested in New York on Thursday and has pleaded not guilty to multiple charges that he misled investors and manipulated token prices for personal gain.  In setting out the rationale for tougher global rules, the FSB also referred to the recent collapse of crypto-focused banks, the brief de-pegging of Circle‚Äôs USDC stablecoin two months ago and the sudden downfall of the terraUSD stablecoin in May 2022 that heralded a new crypto winter.  Different global approaches  Major global players are taking different approaches to how to regulate crypto. While the European Union has crafted a new tailored law known as the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is seeking to argue it can apply existing hundred-year-old rules originally designed for traditional financial instruments.  In theory, the principles from the FSB should be flexible enough to allow both approaches, but officials are keen to stress continuity.  ‚ÄúThis global framework does not rewrite or create a completely new regulatory rulebook for crypto assets,‚Äù FSB Secretary General John Schindler told reporters. ‚ÄúCrypto asset activities are not as different from traditional financial activities as some would have us believe, and similar rules should apply.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhile jurisdictions work to implement these standards, we would encourage all crypto-asset players to start to comply with these basic expectations and standards now,‚Äù he added.  The final recommendations follow a consultation in which traditional finance companies pushed for stronger crypto controls, while the likes of Binance and Coinbase have warned that tougher rules could constrain innovation.",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,ASIA | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/17/financial-stability-board-calls-for-tougher-global-crypto-rules-after-year-of-turmoil,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/555ab6aa324f65c09a4f8d7b67fc79af39e0e864-5700x3800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Until the rewards are fully distributed, the futures exchange will run at least one campaign per week to encourage new users to signup and trade derivatives on the Flipster platform. Under the old name the exchange has already made available more than 400,000USDT worth bonus in past campaigns. The first promotion in the series kicked off on the 17th of July, 2023 (running for seven days). A massive 110,000 USDT in bonuses has been allocated. 10,000 USDT to reward new users when completing identity verification with a 10 USDT Bonus. The remaining 100,000 USDT bonus is to incentivise and reward high volume traders that give the platform a chance. The top performer by trading volume will be rewarded with 10,000 USDT in Bonus at the end of the weekly campaign. Flipster has reimagined futures trading with a mobile-first approach to appeal to casual crypto traders with limited experience in derivatives trading (or, as they say, Flipping). The method is to specialize in derivatives trading, stripping back the app experience to make it faster to learn and easier to use. Novice traders can open, close and monitor positions from any location. Potentially meaning some users may make more money on the bus to work, than from their days Labor. Beyond ease of use, the portable experience makes trading fun and feels less like a technical task. The flip to a mobile-first approach came after initially having a web experience similar to other futures exchanges. The traditional UI for futures trading has a steep learning curve and is considerably more technical, which strongly contrasts with the UI that most contemporary apps users have become familiar with. The data concluded that users new to derivatives were not attracted to this experience as it had been built for experienced traders. The Flipster team discovered a few alternative UIs for future trading and none that have successfully been created to onboard new users to crypto futures trading at scale. While the focus is on simplicity, Flipster has features that will spark the interest of experienced traders as well. The exchange regularly adds new perpetual swap contracts, and as of today, over 120 assets can be traded with leverage, making Flipster a competitive exchange for traders to consider. Amongst their assets are tokens not found for futures on other exchanges and some even with low visibility in spot markets. CEO Yongjin Kim said, ""The team has been working very hard on bringing this new vision for futures trading to life, and now is the right time to incentivise users to trade with us. Once users start trading on our platform, they will be coming back again and again. Rather than just copying what every other exchange has done, we are doing something fresh, and I believe the market is ready for some injection of new ideas. To our existing users, I want to thank you for being with us, and to the new guys coming in now, Welcome"".

Data from crypto market tracker Coingecko shows USTC trading at $0.0186, notching a 24-hour increase in value of 21.4%. In the last seven days, the stablecoin registered an impressive 58% rally, causing its trading volume to balloon to a solid 409%. Source: Coingecko USTC Organic Growth Pushes Stablecoin Up Despite the fact that the causes of this upswing are yet unknown, the recent spike in USTC‚Äôs value shows organic growth. ‚ÄúOrganic growth‚Äù refers to the increase in value of USTC that occurs naturally, without the influence of external factors or artificial means.

After it was de-pegged more than a year ago, USTC saw a huge price decline. Since USTC is a stablecoin with a 1:1 tie to the USD, its price should always be $1. The stablecoin has since traded at lower prices, reaching a 52-week high of $0.06 during that time. There are signs, nevertheless, that USTC could revisit the $1 level and recoup its worth.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening:  Prices: Positive events spurred a crypto market boost and altcoin rally, although the subsequent corrections were to be expected, a crypto fund manager said. BTC is holding comfortably above $30K.  Insights: The robust influx into Toronto's Purpose Bitcoin ETF indicates a high retail demand for such products, signaling promise for U.S. companies with pending BTC applications with the SEC.

The world‚Äôs largest digital asset is currently at $30,298, flat over the last 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data, while ether is also changing hands sideways at $1,927.  Last week‚Äôs unexpected rally in crypto prices came from a favorable ruling a court handed down in the Ripple-SEC case, but Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, said in a note that after the market overheated and ‚Äúcorrections are to be expected‚Äù.  DiPasquale wrote that if there is a correction, ‚Äúwe are unlikely to see Bitcoin trading below $27K for long‚Äù and the ‚Äúmarket is likely to consolidate around the current zone for now.‚Äù  The question is, where does the market go from here? Last week was already a busy week with the scheduled economic data releases, and became even more so with market movement from the XRP-led altcoin rally.  ‚ÄúLooking ahead, with no major scheduled events or economic data releases this week, we anticipate that price action in the market will be influenced by open interest levels, reflecting trader sentiment, and trending topics such as memes and artificial intelligence,‚Äù Johnny Teng, Senior Researcher at LBank Labs, said in a note. ‚ÄúAs retail traders may have missed out on last week's price movement, their enthusiasm to participate in the market is likely to increase.‚Äù  Currently, despite fewer short positions, Bitcoin's price is expected to dip and then rise due to nearby short-term liquidity and resistance, Teng explained, while ether and other altcoins' trading volumes are set to increase.  Data from Coinglass shows that the number of short positions are climbing steadily in the early hours of Asia‚Äôs Monday business day, with $21 million in long positions liquidated in the last 12 hours versus $8.21 million in short positions.  This could be part of a consolidation move to maintain bitcoin at the $30,000 mark, instead of allowing it to breakaway and move upwards.

An approval of a spot bitcoin ETF by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is looking likely, and an optimistic market means bitcoin is rallying.  If ‚Äì or when ‚Äì the SEC finally approves a spot bitcoin ETF it won't be the world‚Äôs first, however. That honor goes to Ontario, Canada, where Purpose Investments holds the title of having the world‚Äôs first bitcoin ETF, being approved by the Ontario Securities Commission in 2021.  Glassnode flow data shows that investors continue to pile into Purpose‚Äôs bitcoin ETF, BTCC, with a next 5638 BTC moving in the ETF in June and July. This growth has not only given Purpose a head-start on potential competition, but more importantly, strongly suggests a voracious appetite among average investors for a spot ETF bitcoin product.  Data from Factset shows that BTCC, the largest of Ontario‚Äôs bitcoin ETFs, is almost entirely held by retail traders, with only 0.03% institutional ownership ‚Äì one single firm called Yorkville Asset Management.  With these two data points, it‚Äôs safe to say that retail enthusiasm for bitcoin as an ETF-grade asset is vibrant. Being a first mover has a significant advantage.  Almost all Canadian brokerages have access to U.S. listed stocks, while U.S. availability of Canadian stocks is limited. Or, one can put it like this: Canadians could easily ditch Toronto-listed BTCC and buy U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs, but American retail traders aren‚Äôt really buying up north.  Which is why this continued fund flow is interesting. It demonstrates that there‚Äôs a huge advantage for being first in this market, as the customer base isn‚Äôt likely going to be moving to the competition. Rather, they are buying more.  During a recent interview on ETF.com‚Äôs Exchange Traded Fridays, 21Shares‚Äô Ophelia Snyder spoke about this first-mover advantage.  Within the market for bitcoin futures ETFs, ‚Äúthe difference between the first market and the second market was a couple of days, and the first-place product has about a billion dollars in assets, while the second place has less than 100 million,‚Äù she said.  Nobody expects a Toronto-listed ETF to have larger assets under management than a U.S. counterpart. But with $852.5 million USD ($1.1 billion CAD) in AUM, Purpose‚Äôs BTCC is no slouch, and it's still growing.  Yet Purpose‚Äôs first-mover advantage is hardly likely to be winner-take-all.
