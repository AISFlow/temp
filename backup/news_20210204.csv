42405834,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeovCr,1612480466,"Following GameStop, South Korea Financial Regulator Extends Ban on Short Sales","South Korean retail investors pointed to the U.S. GameStop (GME) saga to pressure local regulators to extend the country’s ban on short-selling stocks. They succeeded, at least for now.      South Korea’s Financial Services Commission announced Wednesday that it has extended its ban on short-selling, where investors bet that a stock will fall in value, until May 2. According to Bloomberg, South Korea’s ban is now the world’s longest such restriction on short sales.      Financial regulators in South Korea initially placed a local ban on short sales in March 2020, as have other countries including Malaysia, Thailand, France, Spain, Italy and Belgium. Economies around the world decided to curb short-selling as the COVID-19 pandemic began destabilizing markets. While most countries quickly lifted the bans, South Korea decided in August 2020 to extend, but only until March 2021.      Then, GameStop happened.      In January, retail investors in the U.S. banded together on Reddit to bet in favor of stocks (like that of American video game store GameStop) that certain Wall Street hedge funds were shorting. GameStop's share price skyrocketed, forcing Wall Street investors to cover their losses by also buying the stocks, further boosting the price.      U.S. retail traders were soon joined by eager small investors from all over the world. In South Korea, where retail investors dominate stock trading (accounting for 70% of the market), traders drove around in a battle bus, covered in anti-short selling slogans. Around 30,000 Korean traders reportedly came together on an online forum to drive up the prices of stocks like Celltrion that are often targeted by foreign short-sellers. Some local politicians rallied behind retail investors who were calling for an extension of the ban.      On Wednesday, Eun Sung-soo, chairman of South Korea’s Financial Services Commission held a press conference, announcing that the ban was not only extended, but will only be partially lifted after May 2. The ban will still remain on over 2,000 stocks.      “The partial resumption is intended to minimize the impact on markets, given these stocks have large market caps and liquidity so that the resumption of short-selling would have limited impact on stock prices,” the press statement said.      Although local investors may have welcomed the temporary extension, this view is not shared by institutions around the world. On January 27, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) urged the country to lift the ban, now that the markets had stabilized.      According to local media, on Wednesday, the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) reportedly sent a letter to regulators in South Korea warning them that it could revoke the nation’s classification as a “developed country” in the FTSE Equity Country Classification index should the ban remain in place. To qualify as a developed country, its equity market should permit short sales.      In 2020, the Korean stock exchange was among the top 20 in the world in terms of market capitalization.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/04/following-gamestop-south-korea-financial-regulator-extends-ban-on-short-sales,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/699a4bd03732eb14f96697ab603751993ec69d3b-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405839,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeovEp,1612477171,Yearn Finance DAI Vault 'Has Suffered an Exploit'; $11M Drained,"UPDATE (Feb. 5, 15:41 UTC): Yearn published a detailed post-mortem about the exploit on Friday morning. Further, Tether announced the freeze of $1.7 million in USDT involved in the attack, according to Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino.      Yearn Finance has suffered an exploit in one of its DAI lending pools, according to the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol’s official Twitter account.      At 5:14 p.m. ET, banteg, from the Yearn team, posted in Discord: ""Attacker got away with 2.8m, dai vault lost 11.1m.""      An Aave flash loan was used to trigger the vault draining, according to an Ethereum address presumed to be associated with the exploit.      Yearn Finance is one of the leading venues in DeFi, known for always enabling depositors to recoup all their yield in the token they initially deposited. The platform recently updated to a new suite of vaults, but like any smart contract platform the prior smart contracts persisted. According to DeFi Pulse, Yearn currently has $500 million worth of assets entrusted to it. Even on version 1, many of its pools earn annual yields of well over 20%.      Users in the Yearn Discord and Telegram channels began reporting drains Thursday afternoon. At 4:38 p.m. ET in the Yearn Discord server, Jeffrey Bongos wrote, ""Anyone know why v1Dai vault is showing that I've lost thousands of [d]ai in the last few minutes?""      At a little after 5 p.m. ET, the front end of the v1 DAI vault on the Yearn website showed a loss of 1,059%.      Yearn's YFI governance token had a price drop of $4,000 on the news. Just after the attack became public, the UniWhales Twitter account reported a large sale of YFI for ETH:      The vault attacked was Yearn's v1 DAI vault, which updated to a new investment strategy last month, according to a blog post published by the Yearn team on Jan. 23.      The vault's strategy at the time of the attack was to deposit all funds into the ""3pool"" on the automated market maker (AMM) Curve. Curve's 3pool contains DAI, USDT and USDC, allowing users to swap any of the stablecoins for another at very low slippage.      ""In a nutshell, someone deposited a bunch to Curve 3pool to manipulate DAI price given by the pool,"" Curve CEO Michael Egorov told CoinDesk. ""Vault somehow was relying on the DAI price given by this pool. Then the contract withdrew after the attack. And repeated many times taking flash-borrowed funds.""      Egorov added:    ""That's a well known issue (one could have it with Uniswap, too, however, Uniswap is not so popular for yield farming). I've expressed my thoughts to Yearn team how this could have been prevented (and similar vulnerabilities, too). But honestly, didn't expect them to have such a mistake in the code, that was a surprise to me.""

But decentralized finance hit a new milestone.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $37,616 as of 21:15 UTC (4:15 p.m. ET). Gaining 1.4% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $36,207-$38,731 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC above the 10-hour and the 50-hour moving average on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price had dropped Thursday, dipping to as low as $36,207, according to CoinDesk 20 data. Now, at press time, it has come back up, to $37,616.      “Still trading around the 50-day moving average, so all good,” said Chris Thomas, head of institutional sales for Swissquote Bank. “Moved a long way back up over the last week or so again, so there’s just a little lack of energy today.

I think it’s just a pause for a breath.”      Some bullish analysts are undeterred. “These markets are going to surprise a lot of people to the upside,” said Rupert Douglas, head of institutional sales for crypto custody provider Koine. “Bitcoin is strong and is going to hit $100,000 this year, but ether is where you want to park your capital.”      “We're going to look back in three months' time and think ETH at $1,600 was cheap,” Douglas added.    Ether FOMO fuels DeFi but fees cause mixed feelings    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Thursday trading around $1,652 and climbing 1% in 24 hours as of 21:15 UTC (4:15 p.m. ET).

That’s a gain of over 197% in the past three months, according to data aggregator DeFi Pulse.      Constantin Kogan, partner at crypto investment firm Wave Financial, points to ether’s all-time high as one of reasons for DeFi’s massive appreciation. Ether hit $1,697 Wednesday, according to CoinDesk 20 data. However, Kogan is concerned about fees, which often plague the ether market when ether gets hot.      “The all-time high is great. For the whales [large holders of the currency] the fees don't matter,” Kogan told CoinDesk. “It's simply not (good) for average people; expensive tech and just waiting for ETH 2.0 to launch. Hard for average people.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed Thursday but mostly green.

Its trust company would be incorporated in Rapid City, S.D.      Metal Pay will shortly file applications with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Hayner said.      Favorable crypto banking guidance has sparked an inflow of industry charter applications in the past two months, with Paxos, BitPay and now Metal Pay all seeking OCC approval. Last month, Anchorage became the first crypto firm to obtain conditional approval for a national trust charter.

It wants to accept cash deposits alongside the crypto, and it wants those cash deposits to be insured by the FDIC.      ""This would be the first FDIC-insured crypto bank,"" Hayner said, adding depository insurance would give First Blockchain a leg up in banking institutional clients. That insurance would only apply to cash deposits, however.      The application will now enter a 30-day public comment period before it can proceed for consideration. Hayner expects OCC to render a decision within four months.      It is possible that a new OCC chief will be installed by then.

42405838,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeovGn,1612461492,Blockchain Bites: The Rise of the Bitcoin Investment Fund,"Three stories    1. Qualified investors are plowing money into cryptocurrency-focused investment funds. Yesterday, macro trader Dan Tapiero, most known for his DTAP Capital fund and eye for gold, announced a new $200 million fund called 10T Holdings that will make bids on crypto startups.    CrossTower, a Bermuda-based capital markets firm, is launching a bitcoin (BTC) hedge fund that will compete against Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). The firm has $20 million in assets under management from early investors, with minimum buy-ins set at $100,000. (Grayscale and CoinDesk are both owned by Digital Currency Group.)  Meanwhile, Stone Ridge Asset Management’s existing bitcoin unit, NYDIG, could see more than $25 billion worth of bitcoin under management, based on current demand. NYDIG currently manages $6 billion in bitcoin for 280 institutional clients, CEO Ross Stevens said at a MicroStrategy event yesterday.  But is this the right time to crowd into crypto? In other words, are we at a market top? Well, famed rapper and entrepreneur LL Cool J (along with Paul Tudor Jones and others) signed onto North Island Ventures’ new $72 million fund.    2. PayPal’s cryptocurrency business has beat expectations, according to CEO Dan Schulman during the company's Q4 earnings call. Launched late last year, PayPal’s (PYPL) crypto services – buying, selling and transacting – volumes have ""greatly exceeded"" the firm's initial projections.    Customers who purchased crypto through the platform have been logging into PayPal twice as often as they were before buying crypto, the company said in its investor update. PayPal gained 16 million new active users since launching crypto, though there may not be a direct causal relationship.  PayPal Chief Financial Officer John Rainey didn’t deny the possibility of M&A deals in the crypto space while prices are high, but called it part of a “multi-year” strategy. Notably, PayPal’s spending in technology increased year over year by more than 30% to $732 million.    3. Only 16 nations have specific tax policies regarding cryptocurrency, according to a U.S. Library of Congress report examining 31 different jurisdictions. The library’s law division released a report detailing the differences between how nations tax “block rewards.”    The report found there is a specific disparity between jurisdictions that set policies for coins acquired through mining versus staking, with the latter often being undefined. There is also little unified thinking on whether crypto is taxed as income, capital gains and value-added tax for mined tokens.  “In order for these technologies to thrive and reach their revolutionary potential we must have the knowledge and organizational landscape of the approaches to regulation,” U.S. Congressman Tom Emmer said in a press release on Wednesday.  At stake    Great debate? Earnings season is upon us, meaning the latest snapshot of publicly traded companies’ financials will come into view. This includes the handful of firms playing around with crypto. As mentioned above, PayPal has seen explosive growth in its newly launched crypto services business.      The fintech giant enabled buying, selling and holding for a number of large-cap cryptos for its 350 million users on Nov. 12, 2020. While the total number of crypto users on the platform or the profitability of this business line aren't known, the company executives seemed pleased with the decision to enter the market.      In CoinDesk reporter Nathan DiCamillo’s terrific rundown of the company’s earnings report, he included comments from Susquehanna Financial Group regarding merchant crypto adoption on PayPal.      Comparing PayPal’s trading services to Square’s (SQ), Susquehanna noted that the latter’s bitcoin business hasn’t been all that profitable. Although revenues have been growing every quarter, Square doesn’t “really mark it up,” meaning it's not bringing in much cash from CashApp.      It’s for this reason that Susquehanna is interested in PayPal merchants accepting crypto as part of their business. “Trading is interesting but it’s not nearly as interesting to us as a payments acceptance device. … [PayPal has] incredible merchant volume,” James Friedman, a senior fintech research analyst at Susquehanna, said.      As DiCamillo notes:    ""In December 2020, Susquehanna surveyed more than 120 small to medium-sized business owners to poll their interest in adopting bitcoin payments.""More than 70% of respondents said they would accept bitcoin for payment at checkout if PayPal or Square enabled it, but around half of respondents said they believed there would be no impact on their business if they added the feature.""Susquehanna also surveyed more than a 100 American adults on attitudes toward cryptocurrencies… [and] found that nearly half of respondents would not purchase a product or service with cryptocurrency, while 5.5% of them would do so 10 or more times per year.""    The sample size is small, though largely matches the sentiment about bitcoin. Although initially figured as a “peer-to-peer” cash system, in Satoshi’s white paper bitcoin is increasingly seen as a store of value.      Many of the market entrants in 2020 that made headline splashes pointed to bitcoin’s prospects as “digital gold.” Bluford Putnam, chief economist and managing director of CME Group, for instance, went on record saying bitcoin is an “emerging competitor” to gold.      For some bitcoin OGs or outside watchers this trend could subvert the aspects that make bitcoin such a powerful tool for financial freedom.      Responding to Francis Pouliot, CEO of Bull Bitcoin, who said “The next attack [on bitcoin] could very well come from self-proclaimed Bitcoin Maximalists under the cover of the corporate store of value narrative,” Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal noted:      “This has been my theory as well. With Bitcoin becoming increasingly corporate, some players in the space may find the cypherpunk/censorship-resistance angle to be an embarrassing distraction.”      “‘Why have private wallets, when Bitcoin can be a SoV in an ETF?’"" he said. (The U.S. has yet to accept a bitcoin exchange-traded fund application.)      As mentioned before, PayPal doesn’t let users move bitcoin they’ve purchased off its platform. This introduces a middleman to what exists on its own as a self-contained and uncensorable payments system.      It should be said the bitcoin codebase has been running for 12 years, without downtime, allowing anyone to transact with anyone, without exception. But the corporate environment around bitcoin is still emerging and it’s unknown the total impact it may have on the ecosystem. The tension between corporate actors and a fully decentralized system will be a thing to watch.    Market intel    Yesterday, Ethereum miners earned $27.75 million in transaction fees as the blockchain’s native currency, ether (ETH) rallied. The average transaction fee was as high as $23.43, the highest it's ever been (it’s never been above $20, in fact), according to crypto data provider Blockchair. This means it's more expensive than ever to actually run decentralized applications or send funds using Ethereum – a blessing and curse, experts say.    “Ethereum miners have been a primary beneficiary of the fee spike,” CoinDesk’s Will Foxley wrote. The industry earned some $830 million in ether last month with 40% attributed from fees alone.  Quick bites  “There’s a macroeconomic wind blowing – big – it’s gonna impact $400 trillion of capital,” a vibing Michael Saylor told a corporate audience at MicroStrategy’s annual conference.  Elon Musk’s short Twitter reprieve ended with another DOGE meme.  Miami’s mayor announced a flurry of crypto-related policies the city is considering.

42405831,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeovAt,1612458712,Meet the Technician Who Unlocks Your Forgotten Crypto Wallets,"Bitcoin, while down from its all-time high, is still well above its previous highs over the past few years. And with any exponential rise in the price of BTC, the number of frantic people with bitcoin stashed somewhere in a crypto wallet protected by a password they’ve long since forgotten – well, that’s increased exponentially as well.      This is where “Dave Bitcoin” comes in. The pseudonymous co-founder of Wallet Recovery Services helps people recover access to password-protected wallets, and with each bitcoin bull run, his inbox starts to fill up.      “These days because of the price rise and just the increased interest, we get around 50 to 70 requests daily,” he said. (For our interview we connected over a web chat service that doesn’t require user accounts, just a unique URL. Dave cares about his privacy and prefers an “ephemeral WebRTC conversation.”)    Wallet Recovery Services    Dave and his co-founder are equal partners of the company. They developed the software their company has used since 2013 as a hobby.      The proprietary software is essentially a brute force attack on your crypto wallet; it tries millions of passwords in quick succession. Run on Linux nodes hosted on AWS, the algorithms the software uses try a multitude of permutations of whatever potential password customers think might be associated with the wallet. This often works because unfortunately, people tend to reuse passwords, despite a host of reasons to not do so.    Read more: There’s a New Way to Get Your Stolen Crypto Back    Early in their hobby days, Dave and his partner were posting in the Bitcointalk forum, offering their crypto wallet recovery services as something they were trying out.      “It was an excuse for us to learn about the tech and stuff like that,” said Dave. “And then what we've done is, over the years, we've developed our own software that lets us try variations of passwords based on the customer's guesses, and then added support for many different kinds of wallets over time.”    Day-to-day in a bull run    Even amid a bitcoin boom, Dave’s day-to-day might be recognizable to a lot of people – he spends a fair amount of time just answering questions via email from people who need help figuring out how to regain access to their crypto wallet.      “They'd be like, ‘Hey, I did a job once for someone two years ago and they paid me in bitcoin,’” said Dave. “'And I never really cared for it. But now I know I have bitcoin, but I don't know how to get to it. Can you help me?’”    Read more: Bitcoin Bull Run: OGs on Why This One’s Different    He then evaluates those queries and helps people figure out whether their quest to reclaim their neglected bitcoin is possible. For example, if your seed phrase is lost, there isn’t a way for you to access your funds. He’ll be clear about that, warning prospective customers that if someone says they can get their funds back in that situation, they’re scammers.      He says that at times customers know their bitcoin is a lost cause. They’re really just looking for confirmation.    The inadvertent HODL    While there has been a ton of renewed interest in crypto recently and with a lot of focus on the whales holding huge treasure troves, most people who reach out to Dave don’t have high-value crypto wallets.      “For many of our customers, whether it's a few ether or .05 bitcoin, this amount of money could make a big difference in someone’s life. So we put a fair amount of effort into all wallets, regardless of their size,” said Dave.      Some people come to them years after thinking their wallets were lost because they didn’t know services like this existed. As for others, it may be that Dave's software has now had time to catch up to the problem. As the software gets better, the company may revisit wallets they were unable to access in the past.    Read more: New to Bitcoin? Stay Safe and Avoid These Common Scams    “Whenever we add more stuff to our software, we'll go back and have a test by trial, testing 'pass or fail' on wallets every once in a while from, say, five years ago,” he said. “Sometimes [the software] finally solves it and we’ll email the customer and it's, like, it's a great surprise for them. Some have said that this actually ended up being a good thing for them or they would have sold it much earlier.”      Let’s call it the inadvertent HODL.    The crypto wallet risk    The fact of the matter is people who use Wallet Recovery Services are entrusting the company not to steal their cryptocurrency once they manage to hack into the wallet. But as Dave points out, the company has a long string of positive reviews; after all, the only way it could continue to exist is by maintaining its good reputation.      Dave also said he tells customers to change their passwords (because they usually use variations of the ones they give him) once he runs his tests.    Read more: How to Store Your Bitcoin    Wallet Recovery Services takes 20% of the holdings of the crypto wallet as payment if they successfully access it.      “Historically, our success rate rate is about 35%,” he said. “So there's a 65% chance we won’t get anything out of the wallets that we work on, which we spend time and resources on.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/04/meet-the-technician-who-unlocks-your-forgotten-crypto-wallets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/08792a8e85ce3ea9f018a96ebcf51f7cd442cfc5-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The rapper and entrepreneur is part of a glitzy roster of limited partners backing North Island Ventures’ newly revealed $72 million VC fund.      Helmed by Glenn Hutchins, co-founder of $39 billion private equity firm Silver Lake Partners, backers include big names like hedge fund boss Paul Tudor Jones; Josh Harris, co-founder of Apollo Group; and former PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi.      The new VC fund, whose co-founders are Hutchins’ son James Hutchins and former Digital Currency Group investor Travis Scher, has been quietly making VC investments in crypto and blockchain projects since early last year.      Hutchins is something of a crypto OG having taken firm interest back in 2015, in both cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, equally – unlike many of his peers at that time.      “Some people might see this story and think Glenn Hutchins is jumping on the bandwagon,” Travis Scher told CoinDesk in an interview. “The truth is that Glenn was one of the earliest very established leaders from the finance community to get behind this technology.”      In addition to Dapper Labs (the company behind the new Flow blockchain and surging NFT game NBA Top Shot), North Island has invested in carbon-credit tracking platform Nori and blockchain interoperability app Axelar.      Quite a few celebrities including some rappers, got involved in blockchain projects during the ICO boom of 2017. This time around it’s a more measured approach, says Scher.      “I would say that pitching LL Cool J about our fund was a surreal experience,” said Scher. “I think people across a variety of industries, including entertainment, are curious about what opportunities this technology presents for them.”      UPDATE (Feb. 4, 16:35 UTC): Adds comments from North Island Ventures Managing Partner Travis Scher.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | FLOW | TOKEN SALE,"Zack Seward, Ian Allison",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/04/72m-crypto-fund-backed-by-paul-tudor-jones-and-ll-cool-j-comes-out-of-stealth,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/81aed826a03d1ebac2fdcee5040d1d3a7f3dac6c-1200x799.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405840,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeovIl,1612450729,"First Mover: Ethereum, DOGE on Own Journeys as Inflation Bets Fuel Bitcoin","Ethereum pauses at record high, bitcoin's rally stalls, DOGE Moons    Ether (ETH) prices were lower after surging 10% on Wednesday to a new record, climbing past $1,600 for the first time.      The recent gains appeared driven by signs of growth on the cryptocurrency's underlying Ethereum blockchain network, as well as interest from institutional investors starting to venture beyond bitcoin, the oldest and largest cryptocurrency.      “Ethereum is in such high demand because the asset is undergoing changes to make it even more decentralized and even more secure,"" said Simon Peters, an analyst for the trading platform eToro. ""This is attracting buyers from both the institutional and retail world.""      Bitcoin (BTC) appeared to lose momentum after its steady rise over the past week from $30,000 to about $38,000.      The price level of $38,190 proved tough to pierce, according to Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the cryptocurrency exchange firm EQUOS.      ""Once it hit that level, prices seem to struggle and actually just retraced lower, overtaken by massive sell orders on both spot and derivatives exchanges,"" Blom wrote. ""Stagnation in the $34K-$38K range probably can't be avoided, and eager bulls might be cooled down by relentless sellers before BTC progresses higher again.""      And dogecoin (DOGE)? The digital token launched in 2013 as little more than a joke is up about 50% in just the past two days, for a market value of more than $6 billion. Elon Musk, the electric-vehicle and private-spaceflight entrepreneur who's also reportedly the world's richest man, tweeted about it early Thursday. There was also heavy chatter about the token on social media forums, and probably a lot of speculation about the chatter.      In traditional markets, the Reddit-fueled whiplash in shares of ""meme stocks"" like GameStop (GME) appeared to subside, but the regulatory fallout might just be getting going: U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who heads the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, said Wednesday she wants Reddit user Keith ""DeepF***ingValue"" Gill to testify at a Feb. 18 hearing along with executives from the retail trading platform Robinhood and the hedge funds Melvin Capital and Citadel.      Stocks were pointing higher while gold weakened 1.1% to $1,814 an ounce.    Visa's plans push crypto industry closer to point of no return    With 3.3 billion payment cards in use, Visa (V) is a household name. It's also one of the biggest players in the global financial infrastructure, processing some 188.1 billion transactions a year.      That's why it was such big news for the cryptocurrency industry on Wednesday when Visa announced it is piloting a new program that will allow banks to offer bitcoin services. Previously, Visa had been focused on helping crypto companies issue bank cards and has partnered with 35 crypto firms to date, but this is the first time the company has offered crypto services to banks.      The market impact? Edward Moya, senior market analyst for the brokerage Oanda, wrote Wednesday the news may have helped to push up bitcoin's price. ""Bitcoin’s acceptance continues to improve,"" Moya wrote.      Another takeaway might be that Visa's splashy move could make it harder for U.S. lawmakers or regulators to thwart bitcoin's growth. Ray Dalio, of the giant hedge fund Bridgewater, and former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein have suggested that authorities might look to crack down on the fast-emerging cryptocurrency if it really starts to take off.      Think of the operational, technological and marketing expenses involved in Visa's new project. The chances are low that a big, heavily regulated financial company would push forward without some assurances that there's no turning back from crypto. Or that Visa would make this move before heavy consultations with key corporate customers, including big credit-card lenders such as JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America.      The more investments established companies make in the business, the less likely authorities are to force write-offs.    Ether rally spreads beyond ether. Dogecoin has nothing to do with it.    It’s not just ether rallying to a new all-time high this week: Also rising were major digital tokens from the realm of decentralized finance, or DeFi, where entrepreneurs are building software-automated versions of banks and trading platforms atop decentralized, Internet-based networks, mainly the Ethereum blockchain, CoinDesk's Muyao Shen reported Wednesday.      DeFi tokens including price-feed-provider Chainlink's LINK, the decentralized exchange SushiSwap's SUSHI and the DeFi lender Aave's AAVE have logged new historic highs.      Prices for SUSHI, whose launch last year met with immediate controversy, have quadrupled already in 2021 amid bullish speculation over the future of DeFi. Based on data from the analysis firm Messari, that's the second-highest gain among digital assets with a market capitalization of at least $1 billion – after dogecoin (DOGE), which offers little more than meme-y yuks to its adoring fans. (Dogecoin has nearly sextupled this year, for those keeping track.)      Also getting a lift were prices for cryptocurrencies associated with blockchains that are competing with Ethereum to become dominant platforms for decentralized computer applications. Sometimes referred to colloquially as ""Ethereum killers,"" they include Polkadot's DOT token and Solana's SOL.      “Ether made a significant push, and that is causing projects linked to the DeFi space"" to rise, said Hunain Naseer, senior content editor at crypto exchange OKEX’s research unit, OKEx Insights.      One downside from the flurry of activity on the Ethereum blockchain might be elevated fees for sending transactions over the network, since the rate paid rises with increasing congestion. As reported by CoinDesk's Will Foxley, the average transaction fee early Thursday climbed above $20 for the first time, reflecting growing demand for tokens launched atop the Ethereum blockchain. Those include the dollar-linked digital tokens known as stablecoins as well as DeFi-related tokens.      A catalyst for further price action might come from the Chicago-based CME's launch of a new futures contract on ether next week. The listing should give more institutional investors a way to bet on the second-largest cryptocurrency after they took positions in bitcoin last year.      “The institutions are buying ether,” Ryan Sean Adams, founder of newsletter Bankless, wrote in a tweet. “And they’re just getting started.”    Bond traders are increasing their expectations for inflation    The Federal Reserve's mantra over the past year as the coronavirus wreaked a devastating toll on the economy is that there's no need to worry about inflation; in fact, as Chair Jerome Powell was quick to point out, recessions often lead to deflation because flagging consumer demand can prompt businesses to cut prices while elevated unemployment mutes upward pressures on wages.      Despite the assurances, big investors and corporations have piled into bitcoin over the past year, betting the cryptocurrency, whose supply is limited under the blockchain network's underlying programming, could serve as a hedge against loose monetary policy, aka near-zero interest rates and trillions of dollars of money printing.      But now there are signs another key market segment might be getting more concerned about inflation: bond traders.      The five-year ""breakeven inflation rate,"" which can be derived by examining the yields on various U.S. government bonds, is now signaling a 2.2% average rate over the next five years. That's the highest in eight years, and it's also above the Fed's long-term target of 2%. What's more, the figure appears to be rising fast: As recently as September, the breakeven inflation rate was below 1.5%.      As noted this week by First Mover, economists are already starting to sketch out how fast the economy might heat up as more people get vaccines and consumers start to get their confidence back. Bank of America estimates there's some $1.6 trillion of excess savings on consumer balance sheets, which could quickly translate to pent-up spending demand. And the economy has yet to feel the impact of the stimulus package now being debated in U.S. Congress, likely to total at least $1 trillion.      The national employment situation will become clearer on Friday when the U.S. Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its jobs report for the month of January. On Wednesday, Pantheon, a macroeconomic forecasting firm, revised its projection to an increase of 200,000; previously the firm was expecting a decline of 100,000 in the nonfarm payrolls. The average expectation of Wall Street economists is for an increase of 100,000, according to Bloomberg. (U.S. jobless claims were lower than expected last week, at 779,000, according to a report early Thursday.)      ""The reflationary trends we are seeing in markets are likely to continue throughout 2021,"" according to a report Wednesday from the Wells Fargo Investment Institute.    Bitcoin Watch: Increasing signs of demand from institutional investors    Although bitcoin has failed to sustainably push past the psychologically important $40,000 price level, signs continue to mount of growing interest in the cryptocurrency from big institutional buyers.    NYDIG, a cryptocurrency asset manager, could see its bitcoin investments more than quadruple this year to about $25 billion, CEO Ross Stevens said this week.  The Chicago-based futures exchange CME's chief economist said Tuesday that ""gold appears to have an emerging competitor in bitcoin"" for use as an inflation hedge.  Dan Tapiero, an investor and entrepreneur, is launching a $200 million fund called 10T to invest in cryptocurrency startups.  MicroStrategy (MSTR) CEO Michael Saylor, who has become one of bitcoin's most prominent boosters, said at his own conference this week there's a ""macroeconomic wind blowing"" that's ""gonna impact $400 trillion of capital."" and ""this is where bitcoin comes in.""",NEUTRAL,BTC | DOGE | ETH,BTC | DOGE | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/04/first-mover-ethereum-doge-on-own-journeys-as-inflation-bets-fuel-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3abcb0884a634e95b8228cc65febc3b7f712411d-1400x786.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced Thursday, Terraform Labs has launched a $10 million fund, Terraform Capital, to drive integrations of either its dollar-pegged stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST), or its governance token, LUNA, throughout DeFi by covering the cost of security audits. This follows right after a $25 million funding round from many of crypto's biggest venture capitalists last month.      ""Main objective of fund: increase integration of UST on Ethereum’s DeFi stack,"" Do Kwon, a co-founder of Terraform Labs, told CoinDesk in an email. ""Expected ROI: high – can fund a hundred audits with a few successful integrations.""      The fund is setting up a slate of security auditors to be ready to move fast and get new offerings out the door with the security assurances early adopters want. Right now they have a few firms on deck to do the work: Sentnl, Quantstamp and Solidified.      Read more: Proof-of-Stake Chains Team Up to Prove DeFi Is Bigger Than Ethereum      ""In 2020 alone, over 240 million USD worth of digital assets were lost or stolen as a result of DeFi hacks, but no funds have been compromised in code audited by Quantstamp,"" Quantstamp CEO Richard Ma said in a press release.      As noted, Terraform wants to foment use of UST and LUNA, but it's not worried about which blockchain the project is built on. Though a Tendermint blockchain, this fund is happy to invest anywhere Terraform's cryptocurrencies can be ported.      ""We want this fund to accelerate the amount of building that can happen on Ethereum (and whatever other layer 1s of the builders' choosing),"" Jeffrey Kuan, of Terraform's business development team, told CoinDesk in an email.      He said security audits are the main cost barrier for these new teams. ""We're hoping that the fund can reduce friction as much as possible for promising teams that are building, with the goal of increasing the GDP of the blockchain ecosystem,"" Kuan said.

DeFi’s Knocking on TradFi’s Door      Whatever-maximalists, take note: This kind of fund is about the fundamentals driving a token battle rather than furthering any of crypto's tribal fights.      One of the original backers of Terraform Labs, Michael Arrington, founder of Arrington XRP Capital, told CoinDesk in a phone call that it just doesn't matter to LUNA holders where UST gets used, because the two tokens are inextricably linked.      ""If there's a product that uses UST, it drives LUNA demand,"" Arrington said.

The fraudsters targeted Discord users on cryptocurrency-focused servers, sending them private messages purporting to be from a new exchange giving away cryptocurrency, according to a Kaspersky Daily report on Thursday.  Potential victims are told to register with the exchange, offering up personal data in the process, and either make a small cryptocurrency deposit or go through a fake know-your-customer (KYC) identity check to complete the process.  When victims try and claim their free crypto, they are asked to top up the account with an amount such as 0.02 BTC (worth $750 at press time) or the equivalent in ether or U.S. dollars.  Claiming the free crypto appears to work, crediting the user's exchange account with the promised amount, but when a withdrawal is attempted it fails.  The supposed exchange, called ""withEREUM"" in this case (the scam changes such details regularly to keep it fresh), has been convincingly designed to look authentic, even touting two-factor authentication, said Kaspersky.  As well as nabbing visitors' crypto, the scammers may be collecting a database of crypto users, per the report, which could ""fetch a nice price on the dark web.""

According to an announcement from the group's crypto exchange, SBI VC Trade, XRP lending is available from today with a lending period from 84 days.  The minimum loan amount is 1,000 XRP (around $389 at time of writing) and the maximum 100,000 XRP ($38,900). Interest, described as a ""usage fee,"" is a fairly meager 0.1% per annum, including tax.  The crypto lending service launched in November 2020, allowing users to loan bitcoin at 1% interest.  SBI VC Trade was launched in 2018 and focused initially on the trading of XRP. SBI has a business relationship with Ripple, the blockchain payments firm closely associated with XRP.  XRP saw its value fall after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission took Ripple to court in late December alleging the firm broke securities laws with retail sales of the cryptocurrency.

42385895,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOpp7,1612435041,US Library of Congress Says Most Countries Lack Clear Tax Guidance on Crypto Staking,"The U.S. Library of Congress' law division has released a report that shows major differences across global jurisdictions on the taxation of cryptocurrency gains based on how assets are obtained.      The 124-page report penned by foreign law specialists, titled ""Taxation of Cryptocurrency Block Rewards in Selected Jurisdictions,"" was announced Wednesday by U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.).      Building on the Library's previous research on cryptocurrency regulation, the latest study comprises a comparative analysis of 31 different nations' regulatory approaches to cryptocurrency taxation.      Specifically, the study casts an eye over jurisdictions that tax those who obtain mining block rewards versus proceeds obtained via staking. The report also assesses the tax implications of new tokens obtained via free distributions called airdrops and blockchain splits, or hard forks.      See also: Bitcoin ‘Underperforms’ During Tax Time: Analysis      The study found that while tax departments in a number of the 31 countries have published guidance on the taxation of mined tokens, only a handful directly address the taxation of new tokens obtained via staking. An alternative to mining, staking is committing crypto assets for a period to support the functioning of a blockchain network in return for rewards.      The disparity arises because more recently a number of projects have moved from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism – aka mining – to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model, and countries are playing catch-up, according to the report.    More guidance needed    Emmer, who is co-chair of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus – a bipartisan group of lawmakers studying blockchain technology in conjunction with industry – said greater guidance was needed to implement a ""proper path forward.""      ""In order for these technologies to thrive and reach their revolutionary potential we must have the knowledge and organizational landscape of the approaches to regulation,"" said Emmer in a press release on Wednesday.      Out of the 31 nations, 16 have been identified as possessing specific rules or guidance on the applications of various major taxes such as income, capital gains and value-added tax when it came to mined tokens.      Those include Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the U.K.      Most of the countries listed above provide different tax treatment to small-scale cryptocurrency mining conducted by individuals, often treated as a hobby, then large scale commercial operations.      See also: Kentucky Bill Seeks to Lure Crypto Miners With Tax Breaks      Meanwhile, the number of countries that address the taxation of tokens obtained via staking stands at just five: Australia, Finland, New Zealand, Norway and Switzerland.      ""How nations tax the people who maintain cryptocurrency networks will obviously have a big effect on attracting or repelling innovators and investment,"" said Abraham Sutherland, legal adviser to the Proof of Stake Alliance. ""The results are all over the board.""      See also: Library of Congress Reports Surge in Crypto Law Searches      Sutherland went on to say the ""critical first step"" is to establish clarity around block rewards and when they are taxed. He said tokens should be taxed when they are sold, not when they are first acquired such as can be the case with new property.

42411939,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glhEKx,1612433357,What Is Uniswap? A Complete Beginner’s Guide,"Uniswap is a leading decentralized crypto exchange that runs on the Ethereum blockchain.  The vast majority of crypto trading takes place on centralized exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance. These platforms are governed by a single authority (the company that operates the exchange), require users to place funds under their control and use a traditional order book system to facilitate trading.  Order book-based trading is where buy and sell orders are presented in a list along with the total amount placed in each order. The amount of open buy and sell orders for an asset is known as “market depth.” In order to make a successful trade using this system, a buy order has to be matched with a sell order on the opposite side of the order book for the same amount and price of an asset, and vice versa.  For example, if you wanted to sell one bitcoin (BTC) at a price of $33,000 on a centralized exchange, you’d need to wait for a buyer to appear on the other side of the order book who’s looking to buy an equal or higher amount of bitcoin at that price.  The main problem with this type of system is liquidity, which in this context refers to the depth and number of orders there are on the order book at any given time. If there’s low liquidity, it means traders may not be able to fill their buy or sell orders.  Another way to think of liquidity: Imagine you own a food stall in a street market. If the street market is busy with stall owners selling goods and people buying produce and products, it would be considered a ""liquid market."" If the market was quiet and there was little buying and selling going on, it would be considered a ""narrow market.""  Read more: Crypto Trading 101: How to Read an Exchange Order Book  What is Uniswap?  Uniswap is a completely different type of exchange that‘s fully decentralized – meaning it isn’t owned and operated by a single entity – and uses a relatively new type of trading model called an automated liquidity protocol (see below).  The Uniswap platform was built in 2018 on top of the Ethereum blockchain, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency project by market capitalization, which makes it compatible with all ERC-20 tokens and infrastructure such as wallet services like MetaMask and MyEtherWallet.  Uniswap is also completely open source, which means anyone can copy the code to create their own decentralized exchanges. It even allows users to list tokens on the exchange for free. Normal centralized exchanges are profit-driven and charge very high fees to list new coins, so this alone is a notable difference. Because Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX), it also means users maintain control of their funds at all times as opposed to a centralized exchange that requires traders to give up control of their private keys so that orders can be logged on an internal database rather than be executed on a blockchain, which is more time consuming and expensive. By retaining control of private keys, it eliminates the risk of losing assets if the exchange is ever hacked. According to the latest figures, Uniswap is currently the fourth-largest decentralized finance (DeFi) platform and has over $3 billion worth of crypto assets locked away on its protocol.  How Uniswap works  Uniswap runs on two smart contracts; an “Exchange” contract and a “Factory” contract. These are automatic computer programs that are designed to perform specific functions when certain conditions are met. In this instance, the factory smart contract is used to add new tokens to the platform and the exchange contract facilitates all token swaps, or “trades.” Any ERC20-based token can be swapped with another on the updated Uniswap v.2 platform.  Automated liquidity protocol  The way Uniswap solves the liquidity problem (described in the introduction) of centralized exchanges is through an automated liquidity protocol. This works by incentivizing people trading on the exchange to become liquidity providers (LPs): Uniswap users pool their money together to create a fund that’s used to execute all trades that take place on the platform. Each token listed has its own pool that users can contribute to, and the prices for each token are worked out using a math algorithm run by a computer (explained in “How token price is determined,” below).  With this system, a buyer or seller does not have to wait for an opposite party to appear to complete a trade. Instead, they can execute any trade instantly at a known price provided there’s enough liquidity in the particular pool to facilitate it.  In exchange for putting up their funds, each LP receives a token that represents the staked contribution to the pool. For example, if you contributed $10,000 to a liquidity pool that held $100,000 in total, you would receive a token for 10% of that pool. This token can be redeemed for a share of the trading fees. Uniswap charges users a flat 0.30% fee for every trade that takes place on the platform and automatically sends it to a liquidity reserve.  Whenever a liquidity provider decides they want to exit, they receive a portion of the total fees from the reserve relative to their staked amount in that pool. The token they received which keeps a record of what stake they’re owed is then destroyed.  After the Uniswap v.2 upgrade, a new protocol fee was introduced that can be turned on or off via a community vote and essentially sends 0.05% of every 0.30% trading fee to a Uniswap fund to finance future development. Currently, this fee option is turned off, however, if it is ever turned on it means LPs will start receiving 0.25% of pool trading fees.  How token price is determined  Another important element of this system is how it determines the price of each token. Instead of an order book system where the price of each asset is determined by the highest buyer and lowest seller, Uniswap uses an automated market maker system. This alternative method for adjusting the price of an asset based on its supply and demand uses a long-standing mathematical equation. It works by increasing and decreasing the price of a coin depending on the ratio of how many coins there are in the respective pool.  It’s important to note that whenever someone adds a new ERC-20 token to Uniswap, that person has to add a certain amount of the chosen ERC-20 token and an equal amount of another ERC-20 token to start the liquidity pool.  The equation for working out the price of each token is x*y=k, where the amount of token A is x and the amount of token B is y. K is a constant value, aka a number that doesn’t change.  For example, Bob wants to trade chainlink (LINK) for ether using the Uniswap LINK/ETH pool. Bob adds a large number of LINK to the pool which increases the ratio of LINK in the pool to ether. Since the value K must remain the same, it means the cost of ether increases while the cost of link in the pool decreases. So the more LINK Bob puts in, the less ether he gets in return because the price of it increases.  The size of the liquidity pool also determines how much the price of tokens will change during a trade. The more money, aka liquidity, there is in a pool, the easier it is to make larger trades without causing the price to slide as much.  Arbitrage  Arbitrage traders are an essential component of the Uniswap ecosystem. These are traders that specialize in finding price discrepancies across multiple exchanges and use them to secure a profit. For example, if bitcoin was trading on Kraken for $35,500 and Binance at $35,450, you could buy bitcoin on Binance and sell it on Kraken to secure an easy profit. If done with large volumes it’s possible to bank a considerable profit with relatively low risk.  What arbitrage traders do on Uniswap is find tokens that are trading above or below their average market price – as a result of large trades creating imbalances in the pool and lowering or raising the price – and buy or sell them accordingly. They do this until the price of the token rebalances in line with the price on other exchanges and there is no more profit to be made. This harmonious relationship between the automated market maker system and arbitrage traders is what keeps Uniswap token prices in line with the rest of the market.  How to use Uniswap  Getting started with Uniswap is relatively straightforward, however, you will need to make sure you already have an ERC-20 supported wallet setup such as MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase wallet, Portis, or Fortmatic.  Once you have one of those wallets, you need to add ether to it in order to trade on Uniswap and pay for gas – this is what Ethereum transaction fees are called. Gas payments vary in price depending on how many people are using the network. Most ERC-20 compatible wallet services give you three choices when making a payment over the Ethereum blockchain: slow, medium or fast. Slow is the cheapest option, fast is the most expensive and medium is somewhere in between. This determines how quickly your transaction is processed by Ethereum network miners.  Read more: Ethereum 101: What is Ethereum Mining?  1. Head to https://uniswap.org 2. Click “Use Uniswap” in the top right-hand corner. 3. Go to “Connect wallet” in the top right-hand corner and select the wallet you have. 4. Log into your wallet and allow it to connect to Uniswap.5. On the screen it will give you an option to swap tokens directly using the drop-down options next to the “from” and “to” sections. 6. Select which token you’d like to swap, enter the amount and click “swap.” 7. A preview window of the transaction will appear and you will need to confirm the transaction on your ERC-20 wallet. 8. Wait for the transaction to be added to the Ethereum blockchain. You can check its progress by copying and pasting the transaction ID into https://etherscan.io/. The transaction ID will be available in your wallet by finding the transaction in your sent transaction history.  Uniswap's UNI token  Uniswaps native token, UNI, is known as a governance token. This gives holders the right to vote on new developments and changes to the platform, including how minted tokens should be distributed to the community and developers as well as any changes to fee structures. The UNI token was originally created in September 2020 in an effort to prevent users from defecting to rival DEX SushiSwap. One month before UNI tokens launched, SushiSwap – a fork of Uniswap – had incentivized users from Uniswap to allow SushiSwap to reallocate their funds to the new platform by rewarding them with SUSHI tokens. This was a new type of token that gave users governance rights over the new protocol as well as a proportionate amount of all transaction fees paid to the platform.  Uniswap responded by creating 1 billion UNI tokens and decided to distribute 150 million of them to anybody who had ever used the platform. Each person received 400 UNI tokens, which at the time amounted to over $1,000.",NEUTRAL,UNI,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | UNI,Ollie Leech,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/04/what-is-uniswap-a-complete-beginners-guide,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b28f5577246eb2f07b7b11bbb789ff162abc200e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a CME-presented explainer video posted by Bloomberg on Wednesday, Putnam said the yellow metal's ongoing production, likely to increase in 2021, contrasts with bitcoin's fixed supply.      The World Gold Council estimates roughly 197,576 metric tonnes (217,790 tons) of the shiny metal have been mined throughout history with an additional 2,500-3,000 tonnes (2,756-3,306 tons) added to stock levels each year.      By contrast, bitcoin is designed to have a fixed supply of 21 million units – the maximum that can ever be created as ""block rewards"" obtained via proof-of-work mining. To date, 18.62 million BTC have already been mined.      However, Putnam cautioned viewers that fixed supply does not necessarily equate to less volatility. In fact, the opposite is more true when supply is relatively inelastic.      ""Shifting patterns with demand can have very large and abrupt impacts on prices, bitcoin has illustrated this point,"" he said.      See also: Bank of Singapore Says Crypto Could Replace Gold as Store of Value      Putnam noted his firm has begun to notice gold's waning appeal as a hedge against global political risk.

42385901,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOpst,1612397157,Myanmar Military Blocks Facebook as Global Internet Disruptions Intensify,"The new military government in Myanmar has reportedly ordered telecommunications companies to temporarily block access to Facebook citing the platform is a threat to the restoration of stability in the country, as part of a broader effort to restrict internet access following a coup last month.      The non-partisan internet shutdown tracker NetBlocks confirmed that access to Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp servers was now restricted in the country. Internet disruptions were also recorded on Jan. 31, 2021, when Myanmar’s military seized control in the coup that brought them to power.      When it comes to politically motivated internet shutdowns, 2021 is already off to a miserable start. In January alone India, Myanmar and Uganda all suffered internet disruptions tied to political events.      In Uganda, the state completely shut the internet down on the day of its presidential election in early January. Last week, Indian authorities restricted internet access in multiple areas near its capital, New Delhi, as local farmers protested agricultural laws that were passed in September last year.      According to Hanna Kreitem, a technical expert at the internet policy NGO Internet Society, apart from the violation of basic human freedoms, internet shutdowns are detrimental to growth as they have an immediate financial impact on a country’s economy. Kreitem explained that internet shutdowns damp economic activity, which consequently reduce profits for local businesses and lower tax revenues.      “Furthermore, many individuals, organizations, and businesses around the world rely on Internet-based services that depend on critical functions like data storage, data processing, and financial transactions based in various countries. Disrupting access to these services inevitably reduces productivity, resulting in significant economic losses,” Kreitem said.    The cost    A 2020 report by Top10VPN revealed that regional internet disruptions combined with prolonged internet blackouts in Kashmir may have cost India $2.8 billion in 2020, while disruptions in Myanmar may have cost the country’s economy $190 million.      Due to the COVID-19 pandemic 2021 is a critical year, and emerging economies cannot afford the economic and infrastructure costs that Internet shutdowns often cause on top of the pressures of the ongoing pandemic, Kreitem said.      India, for instance, aspires to be a tech hub but has a complicated history of policing the internet to quell dissent and protests. Kreitem said internet shutdowns will have an impact on those aspirations.      “We believe that Internet shutdowns erode the trust people place in Internet infrastructure to be available and to work reliably when needed. Over time, people stop using unreliable networks, leading to reduced investment and further decline in investment in infrastructure and buildout,” Kreitem said.    Repeat offenders    Authorities in India, Myanmar and Uganda have previously disrupted the internet at critical times, according to Samuel Woodhams, Digital Rights Researcher at Top10VPN.      “The recent shutdowns in Uganda, India and Myanmar show that elections, protests and political upheaval continue to be a trigger for internet restrictions around the world. … We know countries that disrupt the internet once are likely to do so again,” Woodhams told CoinDesk via an email.      Woodhams added that to date, pressure from the United Nations, civil society and legal practitioners have not prevented governments from restricting access to the internet and stifling citizens' freedom of expression at pivotal political moments. In fact, he said it’s unlikely that a supranational body that’s capable of stopping these disruptions at the local level would ever materialize.      “With more elections scheduled in countries that have previously implemented shutdowns and the damaging economic and political impacts of the pandemic still emerging, unfortunately I think we can expect a lot more internet disruptions in the coming year,” Woodhams said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/04/myanmar-military-blocks-facebook-as-global-internet-disruptions-intensify,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f9257fa0e39ea06aa4934430cef1fe3f9ba1c3c9-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
