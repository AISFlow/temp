42399281,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbijcm,1471553585,The Dream of The DAO Stubbornly Lives On,"There was a palpable distance onstage as discussion turned to The DAO.  At this week's Blockchain NY conference, the founder of a startup that forked the ethereum blockchain to build its infrastructure and the co-creator of the decentralized application network itself sat as far from each other as they could while debating the now-infamous project.  Launched in May and collapsing in June, The DAO was the first large-scale ethereum-based decentralized autonomous organization, a kind of digital economic entity intended to operate without central control.  But with more than $60m in investor digital currency eventually lost in the effort, the idea that the concept of a leaderless company governed by code lives on at all was a point of heated debate, and panelists expressed a wide range of conflicting sentiments on the issue.  Joe Lubin, co-creator of the ethereum protocol, argued that the The DAO collapse didn't prove the idea faulty so much as create a sense of urgency around smart contract security. He went so far as to call The DAO ""a great event for our ecosystem"".  He explained:  ""It drew a ton of attention from hundreds and thousands and millions of people, and it drew a ton of attention from security researchers.""  Lubin's company Consensys continues to develop different versions of two crucial components of The DAO — its leaderless governance mechanism and its crowdfunding tool.  Additional panelists included Preston Byrne, whose blockchain startup Eris Industries is building on a fork of ethereum blockchain; Matt Liston, founder of predictions market Gnosis; and digital asset portfolio manager Jake Dienelt. The panel was moderated by Chris Betz, of the Enterprise Data Management Council.  The idea of The DAO  Launched earlier this year, The DAO was built using open-source code written by ethereum startup Slock.it and designed as a sort of venture capital firm where members bought voting rights in the form of blockchain-based tokens.  Flaws in The DAO's code eventually led to a wide range of potential security exploits, issues that continue to frame much of the ongoing debate around what exactly happened leading up to the collapse, and what might be salvaged from the project, if anything.  Another panelist who like Lubin is working on a form of blockchain governance, agreed that the DAO concept isn't dead.  On the panel, Liston described the DAO collapse as a ""wake-up call"" to the importance of ""figuring out the smart contract security code"". Pushing aside concerns about the legal position of DAOs, Liston said the future framework of DAO regulation is ""what we’re inventing now"".  Matt Liston’s prediction market Gnosis is designed to be used to help groups of people make collective decisions by letting them vote not on what they want to happen, but what they think will happen.  Liston described the DAO concept:  ""It’s the evolution of the corporation, not a slightly different corporation.""  The reality of The DAO  But more than once through the debate, Dienelt rolled his eyes in apparent disbelief.  An early architect at blockchain capital markets startup itBit, Dienelt took issue with the notion that some have proposed that the draining of ether wasn't an attack at all.  Leading up to hack, many of those involved adopted the mantra ""the code is law."" Following that reasoning, Dienelt argued that the perpetrator ""didn’t do anything wrong"".  ""They followed the code and they took the money,"" he said.  But later, when pushed on whether the event could be described as an attack at all, he clarified.  ""It was an attack. But he was the only person in the world who read the terms of service,"" he said.  Perhaps the harshest skeptic though to the future prospects of DAOs was Byrne.  Byrne said that in 2014 his company had constructed its own DAO but unlike The DAO, his project included a ""manual override"" feature — also known as a backdoor, a way to stop the DAO from executing its purpose if something went wrong.  The dangers of The DAO  Byrne objected to the idea proposed by Liston that the legal framework under which DAOs fall is being created in parallel to the distributed organizations themselves.  In addition to being Eris Industries COO, Byrne is its general counsel, and he previously served as a securities and derivatives lawyer at Norton Rose Fulbright, an international law firm.  To Byrne, DAO-like software might one day be used to run a corporation, ""but it isn’t a corporation,"" he said.  So in addition to creating a backdoor during his own DAO test, Byrne says he incorporated the entity as a US corporation. Byrne further dismissed the idea the collapse of the DAO might have been beneficial by raising awareness of potential threats.  In the end, automating governance doesn’t make it legal to issue digital tokens as a form of voting rights in the first place, he said.  He concluded:  ""In our perspective DAOs are in-elegant and entirely unconvincing ways to commit securities fraud.""

42399265,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbijN2,1471542440,ASX Completes First Distributed Ledger Settlement Prototype,"The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) announced today that it has completed the first version of a potential distributed ledger-based replacement for its existing settlement system.  Presentation documents published today by ASX reveal that a ""working solution for subset of use cases"" has been developed by the exchange in partnership with New York-based Digital Asset Holdings. A blockchain startup led by former JPMorgan exec Blythe Masters, ASX has invested more than $17m in the startup to date.  The process, ASX said, involved working with regulatory bodies in Australia as well as relevant exchange stakeholders. ASX is now weighing how to go about replacing its existing settlement system, known as CHESS, and blockchain tech is being looked as a one possible overhaul path.  ASX CEO Dominic Stevens said in a speech today that the exchange has ""begun work on the next stage of this journey"", according to Computerworld.  Next steps include building ""an industrial strength platform"" that iterates on the working solution and continuing to engage with stakeholders.  Deputy CEO Peter Hiom reportedly told presentation attendees:  ""What we do change is the way that data is authenticated, authorized, accessed and stored. It is this that creates the single source of truth that could remove complexity and deliver significant benefits to the industry.""  The decision of whether to use the technology as an commercial-grade replacement will be made in fiscal year 2018, the firm added.  ASX also said that it has spent AUD$50.2m ($38.5m) on technology over the past fiscal year, though the exchange did not break down how much of this amount was spent on its distributed ledger work.

Former Bitnet employees Stephen McNamara and Fergal Downey will spearhead the Belfast-based operation, which Rakuten said today will be focused on blockchain technology and FinTech more broadly.  The move comes more than a year after the e-retailer began accepting bitcoin, becoming one of the more noteworthy firms in the Asia-Pacific region to explore adopting the digital currency as a payment method.  It was around this time that Rakuten first moved to invest in Bitnet, with word emerging last month that acquisition talks had begun between the two camps, according to The Wall Street Journal. Bitnet raised $14.5m in 2014 to compete in the then-growing market for digital currency payments processing.  With the news, Ratuken joins a growing number of established companies to found laboratories dedicated wholly or in part to blockchain research. Since the start of this year, companies like Intel, Philips and Hitachi have undertaken similar efforts.  Yasufumi Hirai, who serves as CIO and CISO for Rakuten, as well as the head of its technology division, said in a statement:  ""The new Rakuten Blockchain Lab will be our first step toward unlocking blockchain’s potential to revolutionize the way that financial and e-commerce transactions are conducted.""  The lab is expected to open on 22nd August, according to the firm.

42399271,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbijSw,1471533927,Next Bitcoin Software Update Will Be First to Feature SegWit Code,"A forthcoming bitcoin software update will be the first to feature code that could be later activated and included as part of an effort to scale transaction capacity on the bitcoin blockchain.  Called the ""most significant code change"" in version 0.13.0, the new code added for Segregated Witness will not activate the change, but rather be the next step in preparing it to be eventually deployed, potentially in version 0.13.1.  The software update is expected to be released in the coming weeks.  While the feature has been tested extensively, bitcoin developers are seeking to democratize testing by activating the feature on the bitcoin testnet and in ""regression testing mode"", allowing a wider range of developers to test it out for themselves and report potential bugs or issues.  By adding the code now, Bitcoin Core developers believe Segregated Witness will be smoother and safer when released.  First proposed as a solution to bitcoin's long-standing block size debate last December, Segregated Witness is expected to increase the volume of transactions without altering the block size, the hard-coded limit on how much data can be included in transaction blocks.  The change will ultimately be triggered with a soft fork, in which the majority of the nodes need to update to make the change compatible with older versions of the software..  The software release will also include code for other updates, such as fee filtering, which gives nodes a better idea of which peers they should relay transactions to, and compact block relay, which reduces the bandwidth required of blocks when they're disseminated across the network.

42399277,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbijXr,1471524620,Swiss Bank UBS Latest to See Key Blockchain Lead Depart,"UBS has become the latest major bank to see a significant departure from its blockchain innovation team.  Innovation lab lead and 'crypto 2.0' researcher Alex Batlin will depart the firm in October, Financial News reports. The article cites an internal memo from the bank's head of innovation dated August 17.  During his tenure at the bank, Batlin served as a mentor to FinTech startups at Level39, an R&D lab set up by UBS that served as a key vehicle for it to explore distributed ledgers and cryptocurrencies. Batlin also headed the firm's analysis of the impact of these technologies on the bank's business model.  According to the report, the memo asserts that UBS does not intend to shift its blockchain strategy, and that the move isn’t part of any cutbacks on innovation in this area at the bank.  The memo reads:  ""There is no change to our focus and approach on blockchain technology. We are reviewing the options for internal and external candidates to lead the next phase of the programme and to extend our Level39 lab activities beyond blockchain as we move forward.""  With the news, UBS joins a list of financial firms including BNP Paribas, Deloitte, JPMorgan and State Street that have seen blockchain subject matter experts depart in recent months.

42399279,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbijZp,1471522156,"To Go Big on Blockchain, 'Big Four' Firm PwC Thinking Small","To scale up its blockchain work, 'Big Four' audit firm PwC is thinking small with its strategy.  PwC FinTech director Geraldine Balaj yesterday revealed fresh details about her firm's plans at Blockchain Conference New York. There, Balaj didn't talk about joining the latest, large industry consortia, but about how her company is seeking to form smaller groups designed to find efficiencies in markets on a much more local scale.  Addressing a group of about 200 people at her company’s global headquarters, Balaj said:  ""We are really establishing micro-consortia and playing match-maker to a lot of our clients… to basically come up with the standards that we’ve been trying to do for years.""  Balaj said that in addition to looking at industry-level cooperation, the ""Big Four"" accounting firm is meeting with its clients to help identify points of connection between the companies.  Potential areas where such cross-company efficiencies might exist, she said, include in syndicated commercial lending; collateral management and optimization; and ""any back-end office process"".  The comments are notable as Balaj only recently became a FinTech director at the firm specializing in blockchain and distributed ledgers. At around the same time, she joined, a previous PwC FinTech director, Jeremy Drane, left the company to take a job as chief commercial officer at blockchain startup Libra.  Overall, the event focused on how the distributed ledger industry can learn from the past three years of innovation and build mature products that save time and money.

42399275,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbijVt,1471495131,Bitcoin.org Warns of Attacks Amid Upcoming Bitcoin Software Release,"A new post on the open-source Bitcoin.org website indicates its contributors have reason to believe the online resource may be targeted by malicious actors following an upcoming software release by Bitcoin Core developers.  Bitcoin.org contributor Cobra-Bitcoin published a post today in which he indicated that certain resources the website intends to post following the Bitcoin Core development update could be the target of unspecified ""state-sponsored attackers"".  At issue, the post asserts, is that Bitcoin.org generally posts binaries, or executable software versions of Bitcoin Core software releases, for developers who do not want to compile the source code issued by the open-source development team.  The offering is aimed at developers who do not want to undertake the recommended Gitian build process by which developers are given source code that allows them to construct the executable code for use.  The post reads:  ""As a website, Bitcoin.org does not have the necessary technical resources to guarantee that we can defend ourselves from attackers of this calibre. We ask the Bitcoin community, and in particular the Chinese Bitcoin community to be extra vigilant when downloading binaries from our website.""  The post was published to the website without peer review, according to a representative of Bitcoin Core, meaning the message has not been subject to a typical feedback process.  Nonetheless, the update has created confusion about the safety of the release in the media, prompting comment from Bitcoin Core contributors.  ""There's absolutely nothing in the Bitcoin Core binaries, as built by the Bitcoin Core team, that has been targeted by state sponsored attackers that we know of at this point,"" Bitcoin Core contributor Eric Lombrozo said in a statement.  The specific attack discussed would find Bitcoin.org users possibly subjected to a so-called man-in-the-middle attack by which an attacker could make their own version of these files, which could then be used to encourage users to download malicious software.  ""This malicious software might also cause your computer to participate in attacks against the bitcoin network. We believe Chinese services such as pools and exchanges are most at risk here due to the origin of the attackers,"" the post continues.  At press time, Bitcoin.org representative Theymos was active on Reddit, where he was encouraging bitcoin developers to be on ""high alert"" during the upcoming software release.
