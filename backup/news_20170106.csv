42379131,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7n8sb,1483725920,Report: Chinese Regulators Exploring Bitcoin Connection to Capital Flight,"Though details are currently scarce, Chinese regulators are reportedly looking into the use of bitcoin to avoid capital controls.  According to Tencent Finance, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) is exploring how bitcoin can be used to circumvent capital flight. The news website cited unnamed sources close to regulators, and Tencent’s report was later cited by Bloomberg.  The report emerges in the wake of statements from China's central bank, which said today that it had met with domestic bitcoin exchanges this week, warning them about adhering to state regulations. It also comes as Chinese officials weigh instituting additional capital controls on top of existing constraints amid an outflow of funds from the country, as reported last month by the South China Morning Post.  BTCC, one of the exchanges that met with central bank officials, later released a statement confirming their communication with the People’s Bank of China.  The State Administration of Foreign Exchange did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.  CoinDesk will continue monitoring this developing story.

42379133,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7n8wN,1483722903,US Department of Energy Seeks Blockchain Research Proposals,"The US Department of Energy (DoE) is now looking into blockchain tech.  According to a research area overview document published in late December, the DoE – which is tasked largely with the security and oversight of the US nuclear industry and nuclear weapons stockpile – is seeking research proposals ""for the realization of robust fossil energy systems"" incorporating blockchain.  The solicitation for proposals is the first for the DoE, though other departments in the US government have in research projects and startups to date. A number of startups in the space are focused on the application of the technology to new ways of distributing or funding power.  According to the DoE, cybersecurity is one major area of interest.  The DoE said in the notice:  ""Proposals are sought to develop novel concepts for energy systems that rely on blockchain technology to assure robust systems that are less susceptible to cyber-attack. Direct use of real-time measurement data from sensor networks and/or “smart” components that feature embedded instrumentation or other enabling technologies that support the industrial 'Internet of Things (IoT)' is strongly encouraged.""  While it's not immediately clear to what extent the DoE would put any successful pitches into practice, the document suggests that the department is seeking detailed approaches to the technology.  ""Project objectives will include software development, preliminary testing to establish proof of concept, and an approach for full integration of the blockchain-based software with system hardware at lab-scale and/or pilot scale,"" the DoE said.

42379143,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7n91P,1483716026,Bitcoin-Powered Internet Advances With $4 Million Blockstack Funding,"A new version of the Internet built on the bitcoin blockchain is another step closer to reality thanks to a $4m investment in Blockstack revealed in SEC documents earlier this week.  The three-year old project leverages the bitcoin blockchain to build a new Internet free of centralized servers and with a browser that enables users to control their own identities.  Based in New York, the company behind the effort is already building a browser for this new Internet, and the four-person team plans to use the funds to finalize a single, unified platform with which developers can build a new network of sites.  But in conversation with CoinDesk, Blockstack's co-founders emphasized the investment won't just help build their own platform.  According to the team, the money is an investment in every other company already using the technology and those in the future looking to help build this new Internet.  Blockstack co-founder Ryan Shea told CoinDesk:  ""We're going to pour resources into Blockstack, and contribute that to the community.""  Firms already building with the company's technology include a wide range of bootstrapped projects, venture-backed startups and global software providers.  Among a total of about a dozen firms publicized so far are decentralized marketplace, OpenBazaar, blockchain-based record startup Tierion, and as of last May, software giant Microsoft, which partnered with ConsenSys to build a decentralized identity platform capable of running across blockchains.  The investment led by returning investor Union Square Ventures will be used to grow the team's size from four full-time employees to as many as 10, continue work on a single unified development platform, and in the coming months, launch a new kind of web browser.  Other investors are Lux Capital, which participated as a secondary lead investor, Naval Ravikant, Digital Currency Group, Compound, Version One, Kal Vepuri and Rising Tide.  In total, the startup has raised $5.3m to date.  What's in the stack?  For those new to the company, Blockstack launched in 2013 as OneName, an identity platform that in its early days logged verified identities directly in the bitcoin blockchain.  The technology in its current incarnation is designed to be blockchain agnostic, but it is largely comprised of work the startup had done with the bitcoin blockchain.  In addition to learning that the method of logging directly in the bitcoin blockchain didn't scale well, Shea and his co-founder Muneeb Ali discovered that giving users an identity to own was only as useful as the places it could be used.  So in May 2016, the duo rebranded as Blockstack, an homage to the layer of services they were now working to build, which they say, amounts to a new Internet.  The foundational layer of the Blockstack is the bitcoin blockchain itself, which Ali calls the ""base layer of discovery"". On top of that is a naming protocol that functions in place of the '.com' and '.org' designations on the traditional internet.  In their place are domains such as '.id' for a personal user identity and '.iot' for the internet of things.  A six-letter, alphabetic-only namespace costs 0.001 BTC and a bitcoin deposit is required before some tasks can be completed.  On top of the ID layer is an authentication layer that automatically verifies users without websites needing to keep a database of their users' personal information.  On top of that is a storage layer where users connect to their own storage from Dropbox, Google Drive, or iCloud, enabling a complete browsing experience where the sites know only what the users want and those same users are empowered to collect and store their own data.  So far, 67,000 people have gone through the free process of verifying their identities on Blockstack, a required step before browsing can occur. Last year, Tim Berners Lee, who is credited for inventing the World Wide Web, created his own Blockstack ID, and days later, expressed his personal interest in the work.  ""We are really trying to enable this new world where users and developers have this direct relationship and users are in direct control of their identities,"" said Shea.  Generating revenue  Before any meaningful revenue can be generated from the concept, however, Blockstack needs focus on continuing to build out its community and release more software, according to Albert Wenger, lead investor in the round at Union Square Ventures and a long time student of identity protection.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Wenger said that as more and more people build on and use Blockstack, value propositions will present themselves organically.  The decision not to focus on revenue now is part of a bigger strategy Wenger says his firm built through its work with previous, high profile portfolio members.  ""We’re not spending a lot of time thinking about that right now,"" said Wenger, adding:  ""We did the Series A on Twitter when no one knew what it was and we’re in a similar stage here.""  The power of the browser  Crucial to Blockstack’s push to grow users and release new software is the Blockstack browser itself.  Once it goes live in the coming months, according to Muneeb, users will be able to download the software. This will automatically change their DNS settings across all their preferred browsers, making them instantly compatible with the new Internet.  Muneeb concluded:  ""What we’re building is meant to work with all browsers. We’re working with Brave, we’re working with Microsoft and we’re reaching out to all.""

42379132,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7n8tr,1483713239,Bitcoin Exchange BTCC Responds to Chinese Central Bank Statements,"China-based bitcoin exchange BTCC has publicly commented on statements issued by the country’s central bank.  The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) released twin statements this morning, outlining that it had met this week with representatives from BTCC, as well as Huobi and OKCoin – exchanges which host the majority of global bitcoin trading today – and warned them about remaining in compliance with state laws and regulations.  The digital currency’s price also fell below the $900 mark amid the news.  BTCC said that its representatives “work closely” with officials from the PBoC “to ensure that we are operating in accordance with the laws and regulations of China”.  The exchange said:  “As the longest running exchange in the world, we have always adhered to strict AML/KYC policies and continue to be compliant with all current regulations in China. The press release put forth from the PBOC today outlines that there is significant volatility in bitcoin trading, and also quoted from a notice released in 2013 saying that bitcoin is a virtual good and doesn't have legal tender status.”  BTCC went on to note that users “should be aware of the current policies on virtual goods”, as well as the associated trading risks.  As previously reported, the PBoC developments somewhat mirror circumstances from late 2013, when the central bank told domestic financial institutions to avoid using bitcoin. At the time, the warnings raised fears of Chinese government interference in the bitcoin sector and sent prices reeling across global exchanges.  The BTCC statement can be found below in full:    “BTCC regularly meets with the People's Bank of China and we work closely with them to ensure that we are operating in accordance with the laws and regulations of China.

42379145,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7n98x,1483711214,What IoT History Reveals About Blockchain's Challenges,"Dave Hudson is the author of the Hashingit.com blog. He is also the VP of software architecture at immutable ledger firm Peernova, and a long-time designer of operating systems, distributed systems, network stacks, compilers and databases.  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Hudson reviews the various struggles Internet of Things (IoT) innovators have faced since the 1990s – a cautionary tale of what might be in store for blockchain.  2009 saw Satoshi Nakamoto deploy the first bitcoin node, and within five years its blockchain had become a large-scale industry.  But while new applications and commercial opportunities seemed only a short step away, in 2016, we realized that industrial blockchains weren't going to be so straightforward.  Early enthusiasm for new technologies is nothing new. With most, an initial wave of excitement sees new ideas touted as solutions to a huge range of problems, the hype fades, gives way to skepticism, and ultimately, real applications.  In the late 1990s, the idea of Internet-connecting every electronic device seemed inescapable.  Every vending machine, coffee pot, toaster, refrigerator, microwave, and TV, would be cabled to the ""net"", and a utopian sharing of data would improve life for everyone.  The reality for what we now term the ""Internet of Things"", or IoT, was a little different.  It’s all about money  The original theory of IoT was that data would make everything better.  Microwave ovens might scan cooking instructions and thus not make mistakes, refrigerators might reorder milk, etc. Automation would liberate users of these appliances, and give them time for other things.  Unfortunately, the theory hadn't been worked out fully.  Adding Internet connectivity to a device is never free-of-charge. In most cases this was a realm of small, low-CPU-powered devices, with no connectivity, so making them Internet-connected was going to cost money.  In the 20 years since those original ideas, little has changed.  Let's consider the microwave oven example. A microwave would need a pretty simple IoT hardware design, so perhaps $5 in parts cost. The first problem is that the $5 turns into nearer $15 by the time we add the margins for the company making the circuit boards, the company building the product and the retailer that sells it.  Our next problem is that just having the hardware in our microwave oven isn’t sufficient. We need to make it communicate with servers that know how long, and at what power level, each new type of frozen pizza needs to cook. That implies servers, it implies dev-ops teams, it implies software engineers, and it implies business development people who persuade pizza manufacturers to provide cooking details for each new product they design.  The infrastructure side has perhaps cost us another $10 per unit.  Nice ideas  Smart devices are a little like smart contracts.  They're great when they ""just work"", but not so great when people make mistakes. The 1990s vision of IoT involved lots of network cables, but then we got Wi-Fi, and the wires could go away.  Anyone who knows the technology understands that microwave ovens and 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi don't play nicely together. Similarly, 5 GHz Wi-Fi and solid walls don't play nicely together.  While our IoT microwave oven might connect to a home router just fine in 95% of homes, the other 5% wouldn’t work reliably, if at all. Unlike software that tends to be notoriously unreliable, microwave ovens pretty much just work.  If they don’t, then customers get irate and phone the manufacturer (more costs), they return ""faulty"" devices, they leave bad reviews on Amazon and they vow never to buy that brand again.  The idea of a smart microwave might still look great on a PowerPoint slide, but the niggling details turn an interesting concept into a liability. It isn't worth the setup time and $50 to a customer, and the trouble isn't worth it for the manufacturer.  Same old story  We have the same challenges when thinking about uses for blockchains.  Not every problem needs a blockchain as a solution. Blockchains cost money in terms of processing, storage and replication technology. In the case of a decentralized cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin, the blockchain-like concept is an essential characteristic to build a viable design, but for other problems we need to ask if the blockchain features are doing something valuable.  If domestic microwaves aren't an option, then maybe refrigerators might be? Domestic ones have many of the same problems as microwaves, but how about commercial refrigeration? What if we could connect these devices so that if they broke down we could avoid expensive losses?  A large industrial cold store might contain hundreds of thousands of dollars of refrigerated products, so signaling breakdowns and avoiding stock losses must be a valuable problem to solve?  The maths is compelling, but the problem is that it was 25 years ago, too.  While they might not have matched our IoT vision, many companies already found approaches to network these devices a long time ago.  This example has another subtlety. Food storage is generally subject to regulations, and many countries require that records are kept of the temperatures at which products were stored.  Without networking, there would be a need for someone to manually record temperatures every few hours, and this is both expensive and error-prone. Commercial refrigeration equipment also involves service companies and manufacturers providing on-site repairs, so we have more stakeholders for whom access to data is important.  A naïve view of the problem might well have ignored them. Unexpected stakeholders introduce unexpected costs, and may resist changes that do not also offer them substantial benefits.  The implications for blockchains are very similar.  If a problem is already being solved, then, even if a blockchain might be useful, we need to ask if it offers enough incremental advantages? Do we know what all the problems are, including the ones that might not be obvious unless we were domain experts? Are there stakeholders, such as network architects, security experts, data architects, dev-ops teams, etc, who must change existing systems to adopt a new one? Are there analytical needs that require big-data, relational, graph, or time-series, views of any data that is being processed?  Forever is a long time  Leaving aside specific uses of IoT for a moment, it's worth considering an important characteristic of the devices that were supposed to become smart and connected. These devices don’t get replaced very quickly.  Most of our connected devices get replaced quite quickly. Vendors provide support for a few years but then expect users to discard them and buy new ones.  The problem is we don't do this with most of our electrical items. We typically only replace them when they fail. By making them connected we introduce entirely new modes of failure.  One such problem is how do we keep older devices working? Typically, manufacturers don't receive any form of revenue once a device is sold, so what is the incentive to keep providing software updates once those devices are out of warranty?  Another problem is that, even if we might want to pay for updates and bug fixes, it may not be economically feasible to provide them. Older devices will have less powerful hardware that may not lend itself to new features.  A final problem is that our manufacturer may not have considered the possibility of a device becoming compromised.  The recent Mirai botnet has undoubtedly highlighted these issues, but how many toaster manufacturers have the level of security engineering skill to secure, and continue to secure, an IoT device against advanced adversaries?  These are all governance problems. How will our IoT device, once installed, continue to function, and avoid becoming a problem?  Parallel problems  The parallels for blockchains are, again, striking.  We have seen major concerns about the governance of the bitcoin and ethereum networks throughout 2016, with both having problems in terms defining operational rules in the face of users pushing the boundaries of the installed designs.  With bitcoin, the block size has seen miners incentivized to restrict block expansion to maximize mining rewards, while The DAO hack incentivized users to want their coins back.  When we consider the deployment of blockchains into other types of applications, then how are these sorts of governance issues to be reviewed and resolved? If we consider systems that might potentially operate for many years, then what does it mean to have immutable storage indefinitely? How will the inevitable mistakes of various human users be corrected? What are the incentives for participants to keep systems running correctly?  In the case of commercial deployments, what are the implications for rolling out updates and upgrades across organizations that have different priorities?  A new hype?  Our journey through the history of IoT has been somewhat cautionary, and there are many unanswered questions, but this is not the story of a lost war.  Twenty years ago, Internet radio stations had barely surfaced, TiVo had yet to produce a set-top box, and ideas of 4k video on-demand streaming were distant science fiction.  Fast forward 20 years later, and designers have leveraged advances in processing, power management, wide-area networking, wireless networking, storage, display technologies and distributed cloud storage, to construct new end-user experiences.  Smart TVs and smartphones are barely recognizable from earlier CRT TVs and crude mobile phones, and yet both have a clear lineage to the original idea of connected things.  IoT arrived but not quite as expected.  Business empires based on the concepts of VHS tapes and DVDs were displaced. Users gained access to far more content, with lower costs and dramatically improved convenience. IoT technologies were not used in isolation, but were combined to solve real problems for the people who ultimately pay for the solutions, customers.  This, then, is part of the challenge for blockchains.  The commercial refrigeration systems slowly changed too. Internet connectivity was a better approach than the ad-hoc methods used 20 years ago, and so replaced earlier designs when they reached natural replacement cycles. Likewise, mature and more capable blockchain designs may well have opportunities to replace other technologies in the future.  Bitcoin stands as the first example of a viable blockchain solution to a well-defined problem. As with many first-generation designs it has also served to highlight challenges, and its ultimate success or failure will depend on its ability to see them resolved.  The challenge for other blockchains might be similar, but won’t be the same.  Blockchain technology will be well served by recognizing, and confronting the hardest problems that we know about, rather than imagining that we can resolve them later. We know that issues such as security, privacy, deployment and governance need to be addressed.  At the same time, we must avoid the temptation to use blockchains, and blockchain ideas, where they are not the best solutions, and champion those where they are.  If we do these things, then 2017 should be a year where blockchain hype gives way to blockchain hope.

42379137,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7n909,1483710028,Déjà vu? Bitcoin Price Slips Below $900 Amid China News,"The price of bitcoin has declined more than 11% already today, a development that comes amid a week of high market volatility.  The movements are the latest in a week of trading that has seen the price of the digital currency nearing all-time highs before falling nearly $200 in a matter of hours and later recovering.  At press time, the price of bitcoin is averaging $899.00 across global exchanges, according to data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  The news also notably follows a decision by the People's Bank of China (PBoC), China's central bank, to publicly disclose that it had issued warnings to major exchanges in the country or otherwise discussed their practices within a legal context.  Representatives from BTCC, OKCoin and Huobi – marketplaces that account for the bulk of the world's bitcoin volumes, according to data from Bitcoinity – met with PBoC officials earlier this week.  CNY-denominated markets are down more than 9% from the day’s high. Average prices are currently ¥5,856.40, BPI data shows.  Observers have suggested that the price may remain depressed while the PBoC news is absorbed by the market, though they struck a largely bullish tone long term.  Déjà vu  That said, the story raises the specter of Chinese regulatory involvement in the bitcoin space, the threat of which sent bitcoin markets plunging in late 2013 after the Chinese central bank issued warnings to domestic financial institutions.  However, it remains uncertain whether the China news is directly correlated with the movements, as it was in 2013.  Bitcoin's price first began to slip today at around 8:00 UTC, when prices dropped nearly $30 in one hour.  News of the PBOC's actions, by comparison, don't seem to have impacted social media discussion until 11:00 UTC, when posts began appearing on the social media networks Twitter and Reddit.  Nonetheless, comments suggest that some may be using the news as a way to influence markets or otherwise gauge their short-term trading strategies given past precedent.

42379147,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7n9AD,1483706511,China's Central Bank Issues Warnings to Major Bitcoin Exchanges,"UPDATE (6th January 14:38 BST): BTCC has responded to the PBoC statements.      Officials from the People's Bank of China (PBOC) met with representatives of major bitcoin exchanges this week to urge their compliance with ""relevant laws and regulations"", according to statements from the central bank.  In total, two press releases were issued today, one by the PBOC's office in Beijing, the other by its Shanghai regional office, in which they revealed the meetings, as well as some information about what was discussed behind closed doors.  Representatives from BTCC, OKCoin and Huobi were all in attendance, according to documents. OKCoin was cited under its Chinese-facing brand name.  Overall, the public statements aimed to serve as a reminder to citizens who may be considering the digital currency as an investment, and both quoted a government circular released in 2013 saying that bitcoin is a virtual good and doesn’t have legal tender status.  The comments come at a time when bitcoin prices have been highly volatile, rising to near all-time highs only to decline by more than $250 within a few hours of trading.  An informal translation of the document reads:  ""Bitcoin is not a currency and shouldn't be viewed as such. Those who invest in bitcoin should accordingly be aware of the risks it poses and protect their investment.""  The remarks come at a time when capital flight has emerged as a major concern in China, though it remains uncertain if this topic either influenced or was discussed during the meetings.  Representatives from BTCC responded to press inquiries, but initially declined further comment citing business confidentiality. The exchange has since released a statement, which can be found here.  Officials at Huobi and OKCoin were contacted, but at press time, have yet to respond publicly to the news.

42379146,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7n9BT,1483701286,2016: The Year Zcash Entered Blockchain's History Books,"Nolan Bauerle is a former researcher and writer for the Canadian Senate Banking Committee, and a member of CoinDesk's research team.  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Bauerle covers a topic that's been as yet undiscussed – Zcash, its privacy-powered blockchain technology and how he believes it could empower economics in the future.  In 2016, you could say that for every two crypto-people, you’d find three opinions.  The blockchain industry spawned thousands of conferences and meetups across the globe, and the constant interaction stoked debates and evolved discussion.  Whether it was block size, The DAO, forking, ICOs – all were contested.  But, one particular event this past year stood out by provoking a (near) unanimous effect in the industry. Whenever conversations turned to Zcash, most people flashed a smile.  Its bullish October launch went on to be covered in The Economist and The New York Times as excitement built for its zero-knowledge proof transaction authorization protocol, which creates the conditions for Zcash's fully anonymous cryptographic key.  In doing so, Zcash forced the world to accept the full spectrum of ownership rights that could come through the use of private cryptographic keys.  To understand the history of this achievement, we could see Zcash anonymous key as the final chapter in a story that began with Enigma, Alan Turing and the end of WWII.  The groundwork  Realizing the power of cryptography, the US government recognized the technology as a munition, an arm for war, a designation that restricted international commercial development and trade.  Yet, Blockstream CEO Adam Back (and others) would led a fight to change this in the 1980s.  In 1992, just before the widespread adoption of the HTTP application layer of the Internet (basically, the World Wide Web), the US government permitted international commercial freedom for the development and sale of cryptography.  Much of the cryptography developed for HTTP authentication was for service providers like email, banks and other password-protected websites.  The challenge-response mechanism for authentication in the HTTP meant that in exchange for your mother’s maiden name, your dog's name, your phone number, your social security number, or your bank account number, a service provider managed your cryptographic needs for you.  Meanwhile, Adam Back (through Hashcash) and others kept working to expand the uses of this technology.  Enter Satoshi  In this context, Satoshi Nakamoto's invention of bitcoin can be seen as the first mainstream adoption of this powerful new tool, one that brought private key cryptography into the public eye and into the hands of individuals.  As we’ve come to see, though, bitcoin’s transaction authorization protocols leaves enough information to compromise privacy.  Zero-knowledge proof tech has found a way to avoid this, putting a fully private cryptographic key in the hands of the individual.  In an industry becoming known for the sophistication of its debates, Zooko Wilcox's invention managed to bring some perspective to what the blockchain revolution is about.  It's not just a database invention or a back office efficiency play or a trust machine. It’s about exploring the different ownership rights that come from individuals possessing cryptographic keys, while using them to express consent, forming digital relationships.  You could say Zcash forces the question of whether digital identity (or KYC requirements) and consent should be boiled down to ownership rights around the possession of cryptographic keys.  In 2017, we will likely see keys for identity and consent serving more digital relationships.  Banks will formalize new digital relationships between banks, developers will work to offer interesting uses on the ethereum blockchain and bitcoin will continue to offer the most useful cryptographic keys.  Other unforeseen uses for keys will be developed and new digital relationships will be formalized, but I suspect Zcash's will be behind some interesting ones.  Have an opinion on blockchain in 2016?

At the close of CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) for 5th January, the price of bitcoin was $1,005.82, a figure that was up more than $100 from earlier in the day.  At roughly 14:00 UTC, bitcoin suffered a sudden and sharp selloff, plunging close to $200 in a movement that sparked headlines around the globe. The decline was all the more shocking to many, as it came just after hours of trading within $20 of the all-time high set in 2013.  Petar Zivkovski, chief operating officer at cryptocurrency exchange Whaleclub, emphasized the severity of the decline, telling CoinDesk:  ""Today's selloff was one of the most aggressive I've seen in years.""  Yet, following these extreme price movements, the digital currency has been far more calm, comparatively, fluctuating largely between roughly $930 and $990.  At close of day, bitcoin prices were again trading above $1,000, though they were about 11% lower than the opening price of $1,129.87.  Even after this sharp decline, however, bitcoin prices may have more further to go, according to cryptocurrency fund manager Jacob Eliosoff.  ""Bitcoin is still way up over the last month, and could certainly slide more,"" he told CoinDesk. ""A robust price rise needs to be built on a base of long-term users (or at least holders), and I've seen no evidence of such a constituency behind the last month's rise.""  Eliosoff is not alone in his assessment either, as commentators are beginning to suggest that the digital currency may be overbought.
