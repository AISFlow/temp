42402788,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcrLz,1554836507,Lawmakers Reintroduce Bill to Exempt Crypto Tokens From US Securities Laws,"Lawmakers are making a fresh attempt to give cryptocurrencies a clearer legal standing in the U.S.  U.S. Representative Warren Davidson reintroduced the Token Taxonomy Act on Tuesday, saying in a statement that the bill, if approved by Congress and signed into law, would ""send a powerful message"" to innovators that ""the U.S. is the best destination for blockchain technology.""  The bill, first introduced last year by Reps. Davidson and Darren Soto, seeks to exempt certain cryptocurrencies and other digital assets from federal securities laws, allowing individuals to more easily trade or transact with select coins.  The act would amend the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1940, granting regulators such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) clarity on how they may enforce securities laws surrounding cryptocurrencies.  While the SEC has released staff-level guidance explaining how it might verify whether token sales are securities offerings, it remains unclear how cryptocurrencies that are not being used for fundraising might be classified.  In addition to Davidson and Soto, Reps. Josh Gottheimer, Tedd Budd, Scott Perry and Tulsi Gabbard – who is currently running for president – are cosponsoring the 2019 version of the bill.  Five of the cosponsors, excluding Perry, are members of the House Financial Services Committee.  New provisions  The TTA is largely similar to the bill introduced in 2018, but the new version will feature some changes, including a clearer definition of digital tokens that will be more inclusive of changing technology, according to the bill.  There are also provisions which strengthen consumer protection and preempt any state laws which would otherwise overlap with the act.  Last year's Congressional session ended before the House Financial Services Committee or House Ways and Means Committee could vote on whether the full House should consider the proposal.  In a statement, Kristin Smith, acting head of Blockchain Association, told CoinDesk that the lobbying group is ""pleased to support the re-introduction of the Token Taxonomy Act.""  ""In light of the recent SEC staff guidance, the open blockchain industry needs regulatory clarity more than ever,"" she said. ""We believe that blockchain technology has tremendous potential and that we need smart, simple, and supportive legislation to make sure that the United States continues to be a leader in this ecosystem. We are grateful for the bill's sponsors for their continued support for this vital technology.""

Announced Tuesday, the “Securitize Ready Program” incorporates services from various partners, including Coinbase Custody, trading platforms OpenFinance and Rialto Trading, as well as private investment group CBlock Capital. More partners are expected to join the program in the future, Securitize said.  The Securitize Ready program aims to help the clients of these partners – which also include broker-dealers, lawyers and advisory firms – issue and manage security tokens on Securitize platform within regulatory guidelines, the startup said.  Steven Lucido, head of the program, said in a press release:  “Securitize Ready frees partners to focus on their core business while providing their clients access to the industry’s most widely adopted issuance and lifecycle management technology. It represents a win-win for both partners and the issuers they work with.”  The Securitize platform and its digital securities protocol maintains compliance during secondary trading and enables ""automated"" features such as share buy-backs, dividends and voting, the firm said.  Securitize further said that it has already facilitated digital securities sales for companies such as 22x, SPiCE VC and Augmate, as well as Blockchain Capital’s BCAP security token.  The startup raised around $13 million in a Series A round last November, with participation from Coinbase Ventures, Ripple’s Xpring and OKEx’s OK Blockchain Capital, among others.

The company, based in the British Virgin Islands, cited ""overwhelming demand from a wide variety of traders"" for the change.  ""We simply could not ignore the increasing level of requests for access to trade on Bitfinex from a wider cohort than our traditional customer base,"" Jean-Louis van der Velde, CEO at Bitfinex, wrote Tuesday on the company's corporate blog.  ""For the last six months, we have been working hard to ready our platform for a new wave of customer accounts and are now in a position to open Bitfinex to a wider audience,"" he added. ""By dropping our minimum equity requirement, the only limits are now set by the traders themselves.”  To be clear, this does not necessarily mean unlimited margin borrowing. According to the terms and conditions page on Bitfinex's website, customers can finance no more than 70% of the value of the digital tokens they buy on the exchange.  Further, if a trader ends up owing lenders more than their tokens are worth, ""Bitfinex reserves the right to seize, take over, and assume all of your liabilities and collateral and to dispose of one or more of your positions,"" the terms and conditions warn.  Upgrades  Bitfinex also said Tuesday it's been migrating the exchange's operations onto ""self-designed, dedicated servers with premium hardware for advanced security and lowest latency.""  Further, the company is upgrading certain areas of client services, such as: ""automated responses to common queries, and quicker issue resolution"" from customer support; a new know-your-customer (KYC) portal; and additional information on the tokens listed on the exchange.  The exchange has been long mired in controversy over its connection with the stablecoin project Tether, with which Bitfinex shares leadership. Tether has been struggling to provide proof of its dollar reserves backing the USDT stablecoin, and ended up saying the tokens may not be backed by fiat money alone.  The two companies have been scrambling to maintain consistent banking relationships after Wells Fargo stopped serving them in 2017. For a short time, Bitfinex and Tether had accounts at Noble Bank in Puerto Rico until the end of October 2018 and finally ended up as customers of Bahamas-based Deltec. Also in October, some Bitfinex clients complained they had trouble withdrawing their funds.

42402784,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcrG5,1554822009,"Bitstamp Granted BitLicense, Will Expand Crypto Services in US","Bitstamp, one of Europe's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, is looking to expand its U.S. operations, having just been issued New York's latest virtual currency license.  The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) awarded Bitstamp the 19th BitLicense Tuesday, allowing the exchange to offer bitcoin, litecoin, bitcoin cash, ether and XRP trading pairs to the state's residents. Bitstamp first applied for the license in June 2015, when NYDFS created the state's landmark law.  The exchange was among the first set of 22 applicants for the license, CEO Nejc Kodrič told CoinDesk.  While the regulator only issued a handful of licenses in its first few years, awarding BitLicenses – which NYDFS has recently taken to calling ""virtual currency licenses"" instead – appears to be ""becoming more routine to them,"" Kodrič said. ""This year we are the [fifth] that was granted so I guess the pace is picking up.""  So far in 2019, prime brokerage Tagomi, stock trading app Robinhood and bitcoin ATM operators Cottonwood Vending and LibertyX have received the coveted license.  To get to this point, Bitstamp and NYDFS have discussed various aspects of the exchange's operation, Kodrič said, explaining:  ""There were questions all around how the matching engine works, how we store crypto, how we [conduct] audits. The license is a set of rules and procedures you have to follow on a daily basis, so once you do that you can [receive a BitLicense].""  The CEO likened the approval process to Europe's standards: the exchange already has a payment institution license in the EU, allowing it to operate across all 28 member countries.  ""The [BitLicense] is not that much different than our financial services license that we have in Europe,"" he said. ""We didn't reinvent the wheel.""  Now the exchange, which already offers some services within the U.S., is looking to expand its operations. Kodrič explained that the company primarily operated in European markets to date, but has been ""passive"" so far in America.  However, he noted, Bitstamp's U.S. operations began before the BitLicense was finalized (the exchange was first founded in 2011), and as such, did have a presence in the country.  ""We were providing services in the [US] including New York before there were any licenses out there,"" he said. ""We have many customers from the States, but we plan on going more active.""  While right now the license only allows Bitstamp to offer the five listed cryptocurrencies to U.S. customers, he hinted that this is not a firm limitation.  The exchange is primarily a crypto-to-fiat platform, though it does offer crypto-to-crypto services. At present, though, the majority of its volume comes from its fiat on and off ramps.  According to asset manager Bitwise's list of exchanges with legitimate volume, Bitstamp ranks within the top four, though according to CoinMarketCap's list of exchanges by reported volume, it weighs in at number 56.

42402768,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcr6F,1554818454,Bitcoin Trader Ordered to Forfeit $800K Gained via Unlicensed Exchange,"A 22-year-old bitcoin seller from the U.S. has been ordered to hand over $823,357 gained illegally via an unlicensed money transmission business.  The Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of California announced the news on Monday, saying that the dealer, Jacob Burrell Campos, has also been sentenced to two years in jail. Burrell was taken to custody without bail last August, and later in October pleaded guilty that he had operated a bitcoin exchange without registering the business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).  The dealer has now also been asked to pay a maximum fine of $250,000, according to Monday’s announcement.  Burrell sold hundreds of thousands of dollars in bitcoin to over 1,000 customers, the Attorney’s Office said, adding that he advertised his business on LocalBitcoins.com, negotiated a commission of 5 percent above the prevailing exchange rate and accepted cash in person via ATMs and MoneyGram.  Burrell has now admitted that he did not have any know-your-customer (KYC) or anti-money laundering (AML) procedures in place to perform due diligence on the source of his customers’ money.  He has also admitted that he initially bought bitcoin through a regulated crypto exchange in the U.S. but later shifted to a Hong Kong-based exchange after his U.S. account was closed over suspicious transactions. He bought bitcoins worth $3.29 million via the Hong Kong exchange from March 2015 to April 2017.  Finally, Burrell has admitted that he exchanged his U.S. dollars with a San Diego-based precious metals dealer Joseph Castillo, and that between late 2016 and early 2018, he and others imported a total of over $1 million in U.S. currency almost on a daily basis.  Homeland Security Investigations’ special agent in charge, David Shaw, said:  “[The] sentencing of Burrell is a reminder to those illegal and unlicensed money transmitters that the laws and rules apply to crypto currency dealings just as they do to other types of financial transactions.”  U.S. Attorney Robert Brewer said: “The federal government will continue to investigate and prosecute all white collar criminals who refuse to comply with the anti-money laundering laws of the United States, and who assist others in avoiding scrutiny of their ill-gotten gains.”  Bitcoin, gavel and handcuffs image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Yogita Khatri,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/09/bitcoin-trader-ordered-to-forfeit-800k-gained-via-unlicensed-exchange,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b4927b714a5e7ff128693a5edae9693b0df95089-1500x964.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The exchange announced the news on Tuesday, saying that its existing regulatory permissions granted by the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC) cover the use of blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT) by issuers as a means of recording ownership.  As a result, the firm can now allow listing of corporate and convertible bonds, asset-backed and derivative securities, as well as open-ended and closed-ended funds in a digital or tokenized form.  Nick Cowan, GSX CEO and founder of the GSX Group, said:  “We aim to leverage blockchain to open up greater liquidity pools, making illiquid assets more accessible, and set the foundations to better democratise capital markets.”  The GSX also announced that it has opened up membership to firms from outside the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway (European Economic Area) and Switzerland, meaning licensed financial services firms from most jurisdictions may now apply to join the GSX and bring their issuers to market.  Gibraltar’s financial regulator announced its DLT regulatory framework in January of last year, making it mandatory for firms using blockchain to “store or transmit value belonging to others” to apply for a license.  The Gibraltar Stock Exchange’s blockchain subsidiary, the Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange (GBX), received a license from the GFSC last November.  While today's announcement only covers the listing of digital debt securities and certain tokenized funds, Cowan said exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are in the pipeline, adding:  “ETFs are products that the GSX Group is especially interested in given our position as one of the largest fund administrators in Gibraltar, meaning we can support future ETF structuring and issuance.”  Gibraltar image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING,Yogita Khatri,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/09/gibraltar-stock-exchange-now-allows-listing-of-tokenized-securities,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/532b38287ad4ae1e5a672df19bf5b6d2eee18212-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Launched  in March, New York-based LGO bills itself as a one-of-a-kind exchange that will allow clients to control their coins instead of putting them in the exchange's wallet. The idea is that clients open a multi-signature wallet with LGO that has three keys, two of which are needed to send a transaction: the client controls one key, LGO the second one and the clearing service provider Altcoinomy has the third.  Now, LGO is getting ready to release its own hardware wallet that clients can choose for storage of these keys, the exchange's CEO, Hugo Renaudin, told CoinDesk.  The device, basically a plastic card with an embedded microchip, will become available sometime in the second quarter.  ""All keys are created and stored in the smart cards, which means that they cannot be retrieved by an attacker,"" Renaudin said, explaining how the hardware wallet would work. ""LGO's and Altcoinomy's keys are linked to a computer script stored in the same respective smart card, which limits their usage to the signature of digital asset transactions authenticated by the client.""  BitGo option  Alternatively, LGO announced Tuesday that it has partnered with crypto storage specialist BitGo, which will offer the exchange's clients custody through its South Dakota-regulated trust company as well as multi-sig wallet services.  Further, beginning this month BitGo will support LGO's native token, also named LGO, which was sold in an initial coin offering (ICO) in February 2018 and will eventually be used for paying trading fees at the exchange.  “Both BitGo and LGO Markets are committed to the needs of institutional investors,” Mike Belshe, CEO of BitGo, said in LGO's press release. “Our vision is aligned as both companies believe strongly in decentralized cryptocurrency markets where exchanges do not act as their own custodians.”  Hugo Renaudin image via Anna Baydakova for CoinDesk",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SPONSORED | TOKEN SALE,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/09/hold-it-yourself-crypto-exchange-lgo-to-roll-out-hardware-wallet-in-q2,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/05b9a008c104d52b9bb4994200d791209a79dbeb-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402803,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcrOw,1554806448,Bitcoin's 'Super Guppy' Price Indicator Flips Bullish in First Since 2018,"View    Bitcoin's ""super guppy"" indicator has turned green for the first time since January 2018 in a signal confirmation of bull bias on the daily chart.  The long-term 26-period EMA on the monthly chart has been crossed from below, signalling that the move above $5,200 has placed bitcoin in an official bullish upswing.  The monthly RSI has climbed over 50 in another indication that momentum currently favors the bulls on long-term timeframes.  Bulls need to keep prices above the 26 EMA (currently at $5,064) and the recent dip low of $5,133 to maintain momentum.  Several bitcoin price indicators are turning positive on the charts, hinting at growing bullish momentum as the bitcoin block reward halving in 2020 edges closer.  For one, the ""super guppy"" – a combination of exponential moving averages designed to signal when price action flips from bearish to bullish and vice versa – has flipped green on the daily chart for the first time since Jan. 14, 2018.  Further, the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) on the monthly chart has once more turned bullish, having been crossed to the downside in November 2018. The level was hard fought for and won over by the bulls early this month when the price of bitcoin (BTC) shot to $5,000 and then $5,200, crossing above the key EMA then bullishly planting its flag above it.  The shift is a welcome development for the bulls, who've managed to steer prices away from the recent monthly low of $3,194, last seen four months ago in December 2018, all the while slowly mounting pressure against the bears.  At press time, BTC is trading down 1.4 percent for the session at $5,159, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  Daily chart  As mentioned, bitcoin's super guppy has flipped green on the daily chart after a year and more in the red.  The shift is a telling sign that the bulls have solidly regained control of the markets and will continue to do so as long as they keep prices above the psychological level of $5,000.  Monthly chart  Besides November 2018, the last time bitcoin fell below the 26-period EMA was way back in December 2014, when prices dropped below that line for almost a year before finally crossing back above – a move that flagged a new bull run.  Supporting the trend change on the monthly chart is a shift away from bearish conditions above the neutral 50 line on the RSI, showing momentum is now back with the bulls after a decline since the market peak in late 2017.  If prices manage to sustain those two key indicators, it would go a long way to restoring full market confidence and potentially attracting larger pools of investors.  Total volume will also be important in the coming weeks as longer-term traders would like to see a steady increase in growing (bullish volume) on the next leg up.

42402799,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcrMy,1554800412,Facebook Said to Be Seeking $1 Billion in Funding for Crypto Project,"Social media giant Facebook is said to be seeking to raise as much as a billion dollars in outside funding for its cryptocurrency project.  Nathaniel Popper, a technology reporter at The New York Times, tweeted Monday that sources have said Facebook is targeting “big sums – as much as $1b” from venture capitalists to support the stablecoin effort. The company would use the funds as collateral to back the token, one person apparently told the journalist.  It must be stressed that, at this stage, the comments have not been confirmed by Facebook or any potential investors.  Facebook has been developing its own stablecoin for money transfers over WhatsApp, as revealed last December. The stablecoin may be pegged to a “basket of foreign currencies held in bank accounts,"" Popper’s further tweeted.  Facebook has also been planning to list its stablecoin on cryptocurrency exchanges, telling platforms in February that it expects to get the product out in the first half of 2019.  While Facebook is far from short of cash, involving outside investors in the stablecoin project could help Facebook present the cryptocurrency project as “more decentralized and less controlled” by itself, Popper’s sources suggested. The company had $44 billion in cash and equivalents as of April 2018, according to CNBC.  Earlier this year, Barclays analyst Ross Sandler estimated that Facebook’s cryptocurrency project could yield anywhere from $3 billion to $19 billion in additional revenue by 2021.  The social media behemoth set up its blockchain team in May 2018, aiming to explore the emerging technology. Since then, the company has been looking to expand the team with new hires. It recently had over 20 open positions related to blockchain roles, including a lead commercial counsel.  Earlier this year, Facebook also hired staffers from Chainspace, the startup behind a smart contracts platform.

42402781,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcrD8,1554796826,"Advocate for Mt Gox Creditors Quits, Saying Bitcoin Payouts Could Take Years","The head of the largest organized creditor group representing the former users of failed bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox is stepping down amid what he described as a protracted legal quagmire that could take years to resolve completely.  Andy Pag, the founder and coordinator of Mt. Gox Legal, told CoinDesk in an exclusive interview this week that he now believes ongoing legal issues – in particular, a single massive claim by startup incubator and former Mt. Gox partner Coinlab – may hold up the crypto exchange's civil rehabilitation process for up to two more years.  Pag, who started Mt. Gox Legal roughly 18 months ago with the intent to advocate for the reimbursement of creditors, first revealed his opinion of the expected timeline in a private forum post last week, obtained by CoinDesk, which told creditors he would be stepping down from his role as coordinator at the end of the month.  The viewpoint put forth conflicts with more optimistic assessments that creditors may be paid before the end of 2019.  Mt. Gox, at one point the world's largest crypto exchange, went into bankruptcy in 2014 shortly after its operators discovered that some 850,000 bitcoins had been stolen from its wallets. While some of these funds were later recovered, the exchange never did.  However, partly due to the massive increase in price between 2014 and 2017, Mt Gox went from a bankruptcy proceeding to a civil rehabilitation process that remains ongoing.  That this occurred is significant: under bankruptcy proceedings, the exchange's customers would receive the fiat equivalent to their holdings at the time Mt Gox entered bankruptcy. Under civil rehabilitation, the customers will actually receive the amount they lost in bitcoin instead.  When the Tokyo District Court, which is overseeing the case, first announced that Mt Gox would enter civil rehabilitation last June, claimants expected that they may receive their missing bitcoin as soon as this year. The claim by Coinlab, however, has since put this timeline in jeopardy.  Now it appears to be impacting other efforts by creditors to self-organize to achieve reimbursement.  Legal slugfest  Coinlab, which has been backed by Tim Draper, Barry Silbert and Roger Ver (among others), entered into a partnership with Mt. Gox in 2012 to essentially act as the exchange's U.S. branch. However, Coinlab sued Mt Gox in 2013 alleging that the exchange had failed to honor the agreement and asking for $75 million.  Mt. Gox then counter-sued, claiming it was Coinlab who breached their agreement. Neither case was resolved prior to Mt. Gox's bankruptcy filing, though Coinlab did stake a claim against the exchange at the time of the filing.  ""Coinlab originally put in a bankruptcy claim originally of $75 million which people thought was excessive … When we went to civil rehabilitation, everyone refiled the same claim, but Coinlab filed $16 billion,"" Pag explained.  Edgar Sargent, a U.S. based attorney for Coinlab, told CoinDesk that he could not speak to the amount filed in Japan, and was not familiar enough with Japanese law or court proceedings to discuss the matter. Coinlab's Japanese attorneys could not be reached for comment. Coinlab founder Peter Vessenes did not respond to a request for comment.  The first problem stems from the fact that the Mt Gox trustee, Nobuaki Kobayashi, normally attributes voting rights to creditors based on the size of their stake. This cannot happen with Coinlab until the claim is assessed.  Pag explained:  ""Because it’s pending and it’s still disputed, the trustee can't attribute fair voting rights if it’s accepted or zero voting rights if it’s rejected but … until it’s [resolved] the trustee can’t give them voting rights … It looks like it’s stalled.""  It could take the bankruptcy judge anywhere from several months to a year just to assess the claim. If Coinlab's claim is rejected, the company can then litigate it in court, which would take another year. If the court rejects Coinlab's claim, the company can then appeal, which would also take some time.  All told, Pag estimates that resolving whether or not Coinlab has a credible claim can take between 18 and 24 months.  Once that is resolved, only then can the creditors vote on a civil rehabilitation plan (and there is always a chance that there may be competing plans). Depending on the outcome, the potential payout to creditors will be dramatically different as well.  ""We’ve started that process but it’s not finished and it’s not confirmed, it’s not confirmed that we’re in civil rehabilitation until the creditors vote on a civil rehabilitation plan,"" Pag said.  Coinlab's claim  Speaking generally, Sargent told CoinDesk that Coinlab's suit comes from ""a good claim,"" adding that ""it's not just something that we made up.""  He confirmed to CoinDesk that he participated in a brief AMA on Reddit a few weeks ago, where he noted that Mt. Gox did not obtain a dismissal when Coinlab first sued the exchange, which it could have done ""if the case were frivolous.""  In an email, however, former Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpeles told CoinDesk that Coinlab performed ""close to zero"" work for the exchange.  ""Courts are likely to consider CoinLab's case with some matter of urgency today and will likely try to get things handled quickly, but CoinLab has likely no interest of bringing a losing battle to its conclusion, and will likely try to extend the process as much as possible,"" he said.  Coinlab is in a position of strength right now, ""as they hold hostage the whole of Mt Gox's distribution process,"" though the company could end the situation quickly by signing a settlement. If a settlement is signed quickly, bitcoin distribution can begin by the end of 2019.  This might be the plan too – according to Pag, ""a lot of creditors feel like it’s a very conscious strategy to try and force a settlement from the trustee. Most creditors don't want them to receive a penny.""  While both Pag and his attorney have tried to reach out to the Wada Law Firm, which is representing Coinlab in Japan, Pag said he did not receive any response and his lawyer's request was rejected.  Hibernation  Mt. Gox Legal is, in Pag's words, the largest creditor group for Mt Gox. There are currently more than 1,000 members claiming more than 150,000 bitcoin, good for roughly 15 percent of the total value owed to creditors.  The group was founded in fall 2017 to advocate for Mt Gox's shift from bankruptcy to civil rehabilitation.  ""It started around 18 months ago when it became clear that the price of bitcoin was rising and the assets of the Mt Gox trustee was going to be more than the liabilities,"" Pag explained. ""Top Japanese lawyers are very expensive so [we pooled together].""  Mt. Gox Legal filed for the shift, possibly setting a number of legal precedents in Japan along the way. Pag explained that under such a transition, a company does not normally move from bankruptcy to civil rehabilitation, adding:  ""It’s rekindling the legal entity enough that you can distribute assets but not restart it as a business.""  Pag is currently the coordinator for the group, with his activities overseen by a board of governors. Over the last 18 months, he's flown to Japan a number of times to communicate with Kobayashi and gather updates for the members of the group.  ""We’re quite a considerable creditor body and we’ve spent some time building up a relationship with all the players, the trustee, other creditor groups [and] law firms,"" he said.  At the end of April, he'll be stepping down.  ""The more bitcoin’s price goes up, the more vultures are circling around. My personal worry is that we’re just going to be bogged down in litigation,"" he said. ""For me personally, and it’s a personal decision, it makes more sense to sell my claim.""  Mt. Gox Legal's board has already begun the process to replace him, opening up nominations to bring in a new coordinator. While a new coordinator has not yet been confirmed, Pag expects that the group will likely shift into a hibernation state, as there will not be a lot that can happen until the legal claims have been sorted out.  Moving on  Rather than wait for the court system to sort out whether Coinlab has a legitimate claim, Pag said he intends to sell his claim, step down from Mt. Gox Legal and move on with his life.  ""I’ve put my career on hold for 18 months and … It’s just a big regret that we’ve kind of been outplayed by other parties,"" he said:  ""In 2014 I had this money sitting there and it was this great big windfall and it was amazing and I had all these plans that I was going to put into place with it. It’s not losing the money that stung, it’s losing those plans and not being able to doing those things I wanted to do, and there’s a bit of a repeat here.""  A New York-based investment firm will purchase Pag's claim for $600 per bitcoin. While he declined to name the firm, Pag said if other creditors reached out, he'd be happy to put them in touch.  ""This isn’t the windfall that I was hoping for but it’s still a windfall and it’s a windfall today,"" he said.  Pag said he has seen some backlash for this decision, which he understands. However, ""this is a really personal decision that everyone needs to make for themselves,"" he added.  He is not making a recommendation for other creditors to sell or not sell, Pag said, noting that many creditors have a shared identity born out of the fight to recoup their missing coins.  That being said:  ""I had to ask myself how far do I stand on principle? When do I say enough is enough. Do I want to be right, or do I want to be happy? I’ve decided I’d rather be happy and get on with my life.""  Mt.

42402774,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcr8D,1554789616,China's Economic Planning Body Labels Bitcoin Mining an 'Undesirable' Industry,"A Chinese central government agency in charge of formulating macroeconomic policies is labeling bitcoin mining as an ""undesirable"" industry in a draft proposal, recommending local governments to eliminate the sector in the country.  China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) published a draft proposal on Monday for revising the existing Catalog for Guiding Industry Restructuring, which lists out industry activities that the agency suggests to encourage, restrict and discontinue.  The to-be-revised catalog, while still pending public feedback before taking into effect, categorizes bitcoin mining as an industrial sector that is undesirable and thus should be discontinued in the country's future development, together with a list of other sectors that either has low and obsolete productivity or result in heavy pollution.  Formally launched in 1998, the NDRC is now one of the 26 cabinet-level departments which all together form the State Council of the Chinese central government, with the main role focusing on studying and penning economic reform strategies and policies.  The agency published the first Catalogue for Guiding Industry Restructuring in 2005 to inform local governments on what types of sectors are encouraged, and what are not, for future development. The Catalogue was later revised and updated in 2011, 2013, and 2016, respectively, and is undergoing another revision.  The public will have until May 7 to share feedback on proposed amendments, after which the final version will be published and become effective.  However, it remains to be seen whether the revised guide, if still including such categorization of bitcoin mining in its final form, will have any impact on bitcoin mining in China, since the catalog itself serves as a general direction for future development.  Currently, China is still home to some of the world's largest cryptocurrency mining equipment makers as well as mining farm operations.

42402775,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcr9C,1554782807,The Trolls Accused Me of ‘Crypto-Colonialism’ in Syria – I’m Listening,"Rachel-Rose O'Leary is a reporter at CoinDesk, covering how cryptocurrencies are being used in areas of economic, social and political unrest.  This article is part of her ongoing dispatches from Rojava, Syria.        ""Crypto-colonist.""      ""Neo-fascist.""    These are two of the more critical responses to my relocation to North Syria, also known as Rojava, to assist in a newly formed academy of media and technology. And while the comments represent some of the worst feedback I could imagine since it's a dark interpretation (one I don't buy into) of what I'm doing here, for the most part, I was overwhelmed by messages of support.  Wolfgang Spraul, a leading coder at ASIC manufacturer Linzhi, spoke of his friend, Bassel Khartabil, a programmer who was executed by the Syrian regime in 2015 following three years of incarceration and torture. The execution was part of the ongoing and brutal repression of technological innovation by Bashar al-Assad, the President of Syria.  When the news of Khartabil's death came to light in 2017, it was a deep shock to the open-source community – shock that continues to resonate today.  “Stability is a miracle, so fragile,” Spraul wrote to me. “Be aware you have friends and reach out.”  Another email pointed to a legal system for stateless societies called Creative Common Law, encouraging me to consider the material, asserting that “It would be so wonderful if the world of stateless legal systems and overseas countries wanting a decentralized world could actually connect!”  While I don’t agree with everything in the legal system – in particular, its hard emphasis on property rights – I'd encourage everyone to read the specs.  The interactions convinced me that I am on the right path – even if my mother was quick to remind me that at least some of the contact had been made by ""CIA, ISIS sympathizers and the Russians,"" trying to pry me for details.  Finally, in an email that reminded me how everything is interwoven, Greg Colvin, the leading programmer behind ethereum’s virtual machine, the EVM, mourned the Syrians that had been killed in last month’s New Zealand terror attack.  While he feared U.S. allies might eventually abandon the Kurds in Syria, he added:  “We can hope that political decentralization and non-violence will make the difference this time.”    Smoke fills the sky on Newroz, Qamishli.    Feeding the trolls  As such, most of these interactions stood apart from the usual barrage of trolling that has followed my work on ethereum.  While the ethereum community has a gentle heart, it can be brutal in cyberspace – something testified to by the fact that one of its brightest contributors, former Parity release manager Afri Schoeden was effectively bullied out of his position last month. A source as well as a friend, not only did Schoedon play a crucial role in the overall coordination of the blockchain, but he was also one of its more critical voices – often trying to forge a link between the developer elite and an increasingly disenfranchised community.  Thankfully, even as Schoedon has fallen silent, other developers are continuing the tradition of challenging the internal powers that be.  If bullying to the point of banishment is how ethereum’s online community treats its most faithful contributors, imagine then, how it treats reporters.  On the ethereum beat, I received regular direct messages from one man, reminding me that I was wasting my life.  Another man, who I later learned had lost his savings trading ether, sent me persistent emails with a single word: ""cunt.""    A street at night, Qamishli    But all of this feels very far away now, as the proximity of war has driven things into focus. Aspects of my life that used to feel important have faded into the background. And while crypto-colonialism and neo-fascism aren’t ideal feedback, at least they’re interesting political criticism – miles away from the low-level name-calling I had become accustomed to.  Crypto-colonist – a term popularized by Naomi Klein – is a comment at least worthy of rebuttal. (It is a term primarily associated with Brock Pierce’s attempt to build a crypto city in Puerto Rico.)  On the surface, our projects have similarities, as both are fueled by a desire to use decentralized technologies at the societal level. However, Pierce’s work, while he has repeatedly insisted is in the best interests of the local population, seems characterized by an insensitivity to the conditions in which it is ensnared.  To highlight this, Klien describes two political movements that are active in Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria – there are the community-driven efforts to repair the island with an ecological and democratic focus and then there's a government plan to entice foreign investors with tax benefits and privatize the island, while continuously displacing its native population.  Pierce’s work, Klein argues, is tied to the latter.  Coupled with statements from Pierce and his friends (such as, “This is where you’re going to bring your wife and kids and build the New World”), the so-called ""Puertopia"" is largely viewed as a project that is disinterested in the needs of the local population, instead focused on securing a sandbox for wealthy technocrats.  Not uninvited    Electricity cables, Qamishli    Like Puerto Rico, North Syria and the Kurdish people have had a long history of colonization.  It is primarily that history, combined with the revolution’s war on fascism and the state, that inspired me and many other Westerners to offer support here. Some came from colonies inside the West; others were born into colonial empires and wanted change.  Yet we haven’t come uninvited, and in all cases, intend to work hand-in-hand with locals and in constant feedback with the needs of the Rojava population.  On a new website, the tech committee – which consists of Kurdish, Arab and other groups from the Middle East, as well as Westerners – details its diverse plans for full technological autonomy of the region, with a particular emphasis on hardware and infrastructure projects.  Projects include building an anonymous cryptocurrency to reduce the reliance on the Syrian state-issued lira, network anonymity through mixnets and hacker academies to be implemented to educate the population.  A general network called the “backbone” will allow people to access the internet no matter where they are in North Syria. This network will also host tools for services such as digital governance, allowing users to politically participate in the society.  The creation of code frameworks will even allow people without advanced technical knowledge to participate in crypto development, by linking libraries and algorithms into easy-to-use toolkits.  Cumulatively, the projects represent an attempt to modernize the region in harmony with its philosophy; to break out from the poverty trap without damaging the history and culture of North Syria in the process.  “Tech is the top priority for Rojava’s survival. The Syrian lira is dropping like a stone, and worldwide access to markets is crucial given the embargo,” a coder within the technological academies who wished to remain anonymous told me.  And while being aware of the colonial forces that have shaped this area in the past, the goal is much, much different.  Summing it up, the coder concluded:  “We're not occupying Rojava with white settlers, we're training people, establishing a mutually beneficial partnership and also learning the philosophy to export it.”  Photos courtesy of Deniz Tekoshin",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING,Rachel-Rose O'Leary,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/09/the-trolls-accused-me-of-crypto-colonialism-in-syria-im-listening,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1b98355cd5e152ab411d52219933609ae82781ee-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
