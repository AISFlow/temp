42414267,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB3SKb,1677626546,Ex-Biden Adviser Said Administration Was Pushing for Digital Dollar,"A recent top economic adviser for President Joe Biden, Daleep Singh, told U.S. senators on Tuesday the administration was in active pursuit of a digital dollar as a means to crowd out private cryptocurrencies that enable ransomware and sanctions violations.  Singh, appointed by Biden as deputy director of the National Economic Council and deputy national security adviser at the National Security Council, was serving the president when the administration issued an executive order to encourage U.S. regulation of digital assets, he recalled in a Senate Banking Committee hearing.  He said Biden’s March 2022 order was “trying to push our government to launch a digital dollar, which I think is the single best step that we could take because it would crowd out the ecosystem of crypto that allows national security adversaries like Russia to exploit our deficiencies, our weaknesses in terms of our critical infrastructure.”  A central bank digital currency (CBDC) issued by the Federal Reserve could mark a dramatic shift in both the banking industry and the crypto sector – including in its potential effects on nongovernmental stablecoins whose role may overlap a virtual dollar backed by the government. Since Biden’s order, the U.S. Treasury Department followed up with its own report last year that recommended the federal government continue to work on a digital dollar while it assesses whether such a thing is in the “national interest.”  Singh, who has also occupied roles as an acting assistant secretary of the Treasury and as a senior official at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, left the government in June to join PGIM Fixed Income as its chief global economist.  He suggested cryptocurrencies enable U.S. adversaries to “evade the impact of our sanctions,” to some degree. Though such evasion may not represent a major share of sanction violations, he said, “even a dollar of evasion is not something we ought to tolerate.”  Wall Street bank lobbyists have decried the idea of a digital dollar as a threat to the stability of the financial system, though a report from the Office of Financial Research argued in July that a U.S. CBDC could give the government an early-warning system for signs of economic distress.  The Federal Reserve would have to issue and manage the digital dollar, and at least one of the board members, Christopher Waller, is openly opposed to the idea.  Singh addressed crypto in response to questions from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who argued Tuesday that cryptocurrencies are being used to hold U.S. businesses for ransom.  “It’s being used to evade American sanctions, and it’s being used to enrich America’s adversaries,” she said. “We’ve got to stop helping these guys by letting crypto go unchecked.”",NEGATIVE,없음,FIAT | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/28/ex-biden-adviser-said-administration-was-pushing-for-digital-dollar,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/25a2e3cb6ba165fe33d7465081c88704b9c9c0ce-4177x2785.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421353,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnslR,1677620494,Dapper Labs Ruling Dunks on Private Networks,"On Feb. 22 came the publication of what will surely become an instant classic application of the Howey Test, part of a 64-page opinion written by Judge Victor Marrero of the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York. In denying the motion by Dapper Labs and its CEO to dismiss an unregistered securities offering case brought against them, the court provided one overarching lesson: If you market NFTs [non-fungible tokens] using your own private blockchain and marketplace, then you should probably hire a good compliance lawyer beforehand.  Acknowledged by the court as the first case to decide whether an NFT constitutes an investment contract under the famous Howey Test, Judge Marrero allowed the putative class-action lawsuit Friel v. Dapper Labs, Inc. to proceed past a motion to dismiss. He focuses on several attributes common to several other NFT projects, namely the use of a private blockchain network and a native token backed by the founder of the network.  Paul Paray is one of the founders of ArtSwap, LLC based in Glen Rock, New Jersey.  Dapper Labs’ NBA Top Shots Moments were said by the court to represent investment contracts offered to the public with an expectation of profit. That, together with the finding that the NFTs’ financial success is tied to the success of Dapper's bespoke platforms, satisfies two prongs of the Howey Test – the four-prong test, resulting from a U.S. Supreme Court case, used to determine whether certain assets fall under the Securities and Exchange Commission’s purview.  Judge Marrero begins his legal analysis by referencing the definition of an “investment contract” as “a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests [their] money in a common enterprise” where “profits solely from the efforts of the promoter party.” The court defines NFTs as “digital assets whose authenticity and ownership can be recorded on a blockchain.” On Page 9 he writes, “Moments are a digital video clip of highlights from NBA games, such as a spectacular dunk or game-winning shot.”  See also: Dapper Labs Ruling Could Spell Trouble for Other Centralized NFT Projects, Experts Say  Distilled to its essence, on Page 23, the judge finds it was Dapper Labs’s control over its private blockchain that showcases how the scheme operates to promote Moments: “[T]he economic realities and technological interplay between FLOW [token], the Flow Blockchain, and Moments, as alleged by Plaintiffs, are what supports the Court’s conclusions.”  On Page 56, the court writes that “a company’s efforts to develop and maintain an ecosystem for trading sufficiently establishes the third Howey prong.” On the next page, he recognizes “Dapper Labs’ implicit promise to maintain the Flow Blockchain and facilitate trades on the Marketplace drive Moments’ value.” Further, on Page 62, “The allegations that Dapper Labs created and maintains a private blockchain is fundamental to the Court’s conclusion.” (emphasis added).  In particular, Judge Marrero is concerned that Dapper Labs restricts the trading of Moments to the Flow blockchain, a network built by Dapper as a faster and cheaper alternative to Ethereum. While this raises questions about profits and transaction fees, the judge also argues that, on a technical level, “by privatizing the blockchain” Moments “purchasers must rely on Dapper Labs’s expertise and managerial efforts as well as its continued success and existence.” Writing in agreement with the plaintiffs, the judge found this situation altogether different from “public blockchains, such as that underlying Bitcoin.”  Compelling authority  While Judge Marrero made the correct ruling as to Dapper Labs, there is always the possibility a future court might misconstrue what was done to the disadvantage of those selling NFTs using, for example, a layer 2 platform built on a public blockchain or a platform not reliant on a native token ecosystem. Such a potential future ruling would be an obvious bridge too far.  For example, unique items such as artwork more typically sold on an individual basis would not easily square with this ruling. It also raises potential concerns about NFT creators who partner with firms like Dapper to market and host their work. Judge Marrero actually addresses this issue when responding to Dapper’s motion to dismiss on Page 35, saying the case law the company cites, Dahl v. English, was not equivalent because the “unique pieces of artwork” being sold in that case did not have a “causal connection” to “the promoter making the offering.”  Fine art NFTs also retain another point of distinction from Moments, given that fine art NFTs will always have an intrinsic value. In its motion to dismiss, Dapper had argued Moments should not be seen as an investment contract because the works have intrinsic value. The judge did not buy that argument and noted Dapper’s terms of use states multiple times that Moments have “no inherent or intrinsic value.”  As a point of comparison, the company originally behind the messaging platform Kik – which raised a multimillion-dollar initial coin offering that was later found to be a securities offering, similarly promoted something with no intrinsic value. “Unlike real estate, [the kin token has] no inherent value and will generate no profit absent an ecosystem that drives demand,” the court there found.  See also: NBA-Branded 'Top Shot Moments' NFTs May Be Securities  There are certainly valid reasons why platforms built on private blockchains should be treated differently from those built on public blockchains, and likely why Voice recently made the move to a public blockchain. Platforms using native tokens such as Rarible with its RARI token may also have to strategize a bit after this decision. Finally, private blockchains focused on NFTs such as WAX may have to reevaluate how its promoters are compensated.  Going forward, however, the safest approach for NFT creators is to partner with a company that has built a platform from the ground up using a public blockchain and without the use of a platform native token or any other direct means of controlling the value of the digital assets. And further, those NFTs sold using such a platform that are least likely to be considered investment contracts are the fine art ones underlying the nascent Digital Art Movement now well underway.",NEUTRAL,FLOW,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | FLOW | TOKEN SALE,Paul Paray,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/02/28/dapper-labs-ruling-dunks-on-private-networks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a158378aef58148121568a2e283542ef1e08957e-2048x1335.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393844,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brQxdB,1677619148,"Crypto Markets Analysis: Crypto Volatility Declines Despite Regulatory, Inflationary Concerns","The volatility of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) has been declining in recent days, despite an increasingly uncertain regulatory and interest rate environment.  Since Feb. 24, the average true range (ATR) for BTC and ETH has fallen 16% and 11%, respectively. ATR is a measure of market volatility.  By comparison, the ATR for traditional financial indices (S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, Dow Jones Industrial Average) declined 2.7%, 2.1% and 1.5%, respectively, over the same period.  The reduced volatility follows last week’s unexpectedly hot inflation data, which offered compelling evidence the U.S. Federal Reserve will need to continue its current hawkish pace of interest rate hikes for an extended time.  To be sure, markets still anticipate the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee will raise rates by 25 basis points (bps) during its March 22 meeting, although the probability of a 50 bps increase has ticked up slightly. Still, inflationary fears are arguably more concerning than regulatory ones. India, which is currently president of the G-20 group of nations, appears to be pushing for a coordinated global effort to regulate cryptocurrencies. The United States supports the initiative.  A synthesis paper to be published in September by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will provide more detail about a regulatory framework.  Crypto markets have not responded to either with a spike in volatility. Rather, BTC and ETH’s Bollinger Bands suggest the opposite. Bollinger Bands follow an asset’s 20-day moving average, simultaneously plotting prices two standard deviations above and below the average. They reflect increased or decreased volatility.  It's been 43 days since bitcoin or ether prices have breached the upper range of their respective Bollinger Bands. The range of BTC’s Bollinger Bands currently spans from approximately $21,000 to 25,600. For ETH, the current range runs from $1,490 to $1,750.

But bitcoin declined after Friday's personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index data from the U.S. Commerce Department climbed by an unexpectedly robust 5.4% in January. Economists had predicted a 5% increase.  Bitcoin and other cryptos fell after the report was released. In addition, according to the CME's FedWatch tool, the odds of the U.S. Federal Reserve hiking its benchmark fed funds rate by 50 basis points in March have risen thanks to the PCE index data. That adds to the volatility.  Lakha said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” that volatility declined substantially between November and December in the aftermath of the collapse of major crypto companies including exchange FTX.  It wasn’t until downside volatility subsided that risk appetite came back to the market, he said. That, in turn, led to more purchases of bullish bets (calls) relative to bearish bets (puts) in the options markets. Call options are financial contracts that give the option buyer the right but not the obligation to buy, while puts give the right but not the obligation to sell.  “As we started to see the market could come alive again, and we started to see those big moves of 10%-plus to the upside, all those skews flipped around back towards calls, particularly on bitcoin,” Lakha said.  Now, he said interest in puts has more or less “evaporated after the market made that big bottom last year.”  BTC is currently trading at just above $23,500, but Lakha did not rule out the possibility it “could trade all the way back down to $16,000” before bouncing back to $28,000 or even $30,000. The implied levels of volatility could be cheap enough to make buying puts attractive again, he said.  More broadly, the crypto options market by and large relies on bitcoin staying above the $20,000 to $21,000 threshold to support projects within the industry, Lakha noted.  Retail investors who still own crypto are likely in it for the long haul, he said.  “They’re not really buying it from a tactical perspective. They’re in it, but they’ve seen the bad times,” Lakha said. “They’re going to probably hold on to it.”  See also: Bitcoin at Risk of Deeper Pullback Toward $20K: Chart Analysts",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/28/cryptos-next-move-depends-on-the-next-fed-rate-hike-options-trader,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ad449d916b4a62ec08828f6d1dc986d7b2c27fa1-4928x3264.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The firm confirmed the valuation.  Aurox is seeking to raise up to $1 million by selling common shares to investors, with a minimum investment of only $252 to target retail investors. The target date to close the round is March 15.  The firm set a $6 price per share in the company and offered 169,000 shares for sale, based on a document filed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and reviewed by CoinDesk.  Aurox conducts the raise on tZERO under the SEC’s Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF) legal framework that allows eligible companies to raise up to $5 million by selling securities over a 12-month period.  TZERO is a regulated crowdfunding platform that aims to democratize private capital markets, backed by the New York Stock Exchange parent Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (ICE) among other investors.  Aurox launched an all-in-one trading platform called Aurox Terminal in 2020 that integrates more than 50 exchanges and now has 70,000 users and $1 billion of trading volume, the firm said on its fundraising site. It also has a crypto wallet product and crafted its own DeFi smart contract protocol and native ecosystem token, URUS.  The company raised $5 million in a previous fundraising round in early 2022. It plans to go public later this year, according to the firm's description on tZERO.  The Aurox fundraising happens as digital asset firms face a challenging landscape to secure capital investment.

Many cryptocurrency-exposed stocks, meantime, rose markedly during the session. The token's price, which has a history of being volatile, swung between gains and losses within the narrow $23.21K-$23.57K intraday range, changing hands at $23.31K, +0.1% , as of 2:51 p.m. ET. It was also a boring day for ethereum ( ETH-USD ), rising only 0.5% to $1.63K.

Similarly, the stock market ( SP500 ) is looking to end February 3.3% lower versus the 5.1% spike in January. The losses come as market participants price in higher-for-longer interest rates on the heels of resilient economic data. Looking at a purely technical point of view, Seeking Alpha contributor Florian Grummes thinks ""surprises remain to the upside"" for bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) in the near-term provided the price can hold above $23.5K.

42421081,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXWRjx,1677613674,What Kind of Culture Are We Building in Web3?,"There’s a common saying among those who study mindfulness: “Wherever you go, there you are.” No matter how many miles we travel or borders we cross, humans carry habits, values and biases to each new encounter – even if those encounters are digital. This truth takes on new meaning in the context of Web3, an emerging, user-centered internet characterized by increasingly immersive digital experiences with blockchain underpinnings.  One area of Web3 that is experiencing heavy investment is the metaverse, a conceptual virtual world that facilitates social interaction. And while this new technology is meant to break free from the limitations of the physical world, age-old problems from our existing terrain continue to affect emerging enterprises: there have been reports of sexual assault in virtual spaces, cultural appropriation in the digital fashion industry and racial, gender and algorithmic biases across new technologies. These pervasive blindspots motivated media scholar Sasha Costanza-Chock to publish a book on “design justice,” the practice of design and creation led by marginalized communities aimed at upending structural inequalities.  It’s time we dare to imagine a technological future with empathy, inclusion and diversity at its core. A growing number of Web3 builders believe in such a future. Here, they describe the culture of the Web3 they strive for.  Building a Web3 community for your community  Dr. Hans Boateng is a personal finance educator and co-founder of The Royals, the first luxury travel non-fungible token (NFT) community to showcase African culture. Originally from Ghana, West Africa, Boateng noticed a lack of representation among crypto communities while running online education brand The Investing Tutor.  “People of color are underrepresented communities in Web3 because people in our community will not be paying thousands of dollars for a monkey JPEG,” he told CoinDesk, referencing the concept of blue-chip NFT collections that are out of reach for many early investors. “It’s just not feasible.”  Boateng came up with a vision for an NFT concept that has more appeal to his followers – a curated travel membership club that serves dual purposes: to familiarize his crypto-curious fans with NFTs and to form a global community of like-minded people who would travel together on a curated annual trip.  In December 2022, the community embarked on its first journey together, culminating at the first Royal Gala in Ghana. Each future NFT collection released will invite holders to travel and experience a different culture.  “I view blockchain technology as a tool that we can use in a positive way,” said Boateng. “I didn't want us to ignore this space and this technology just because we don't see something that we can relate to.”  Taking up space in digital spaces  Online spaces provide accessible ways for people of all ages, backgrounds and abilities to gather and interact. But unless there are avatars that represent a variety of identities, appearances and experiences, the metaverse will not be able to offer true belonging for its inhabitants.  Enter People of Crypto (POC), an avatar collection celebrating people of color, differently-abled and LGBTQIA+ communities. Available on OpenSea’s secondary marketplace, the POC collection consists of 8,430 fully-playable avatars on metaverse platform The Sandbox that also gives holders the ability to display their sexual orientation and pronouns.  In May 2022, People of Crypto Lab, the company behind POC avatars, partnered with the L’Oréal-owned professional makeup brand NYX to bring a Pride event to The Sandbox. To its founders, the event was more than just a party. “What we created with the metaverse Pride event was an extremely personal project,” said POC Lab cofounder Akbar Hamid. “I'm gay, I'm brown and I’m a Muslim son of immigrants. Like many of my peers who are from underserved and underrepresented communities, we've had to fight all our lives.”  Hamid recognizes the long-term impact of inclusive initiatives like POC in building the future of digital representation. “We’re shaping culture,” Hamid said, noting that the global impact of a digital social sphere will reach everyone with a computer and internet connection. “We’re seeing people in different parts of the world like India and Pakistan, where it's illegal to be gay, be able to come, join, be represented, feel seen and heard for the first time. To me that is just the most powerful thing.”  “You're coming in and feeling a sense of interconnectedness,” Hamid added.  Beyond inclusion, the metaverse gives individual creatives more opportunity to benefit from their intellectual property, explained Hamid’s co-founder Simone Berry. Through the rising prevalence of user-generated content and a new ability to turn digital files into monetizable assets, individual creators who have long influenced industry-level decision-makers can now participate in the financial upside of their own contributions.  “There is an ability to cut through the gatekeepers, remove the intermediaries and lean into what I believe diverse cultures do best,” Berry says. “That is creativity, community and culture.”  Hip-hop, Berry explained, is a multibillion-dollar industry owned and shaped almost exclusively by a handful of corporate record labels. Yet, the culture of hip-hop originates in tight-knit communities and is reflected in streetwear, language and personal exchanges. Hip-hop culture is highly profitable, “but the creators of it have not been able to participate,” Berry said.  The concept of a user-generated metaverse that decentralizes ownership was, for her, a “lightbulb” moment. “That is the true power of this technology,” Berry said. “It's built-in equity, equality and inclusion. It's literally the foundation.”  Leading by example  The Twitter-famous co-owner of Fame Ladies Squad – known by her alias, Bored Becky – has an interesting relationship with the idea of representation in Web3. She became the owner of the 8,888-item NFT collection after realizing it was a scam founded by three Russian men claiming to be women.  “The founding team of the project claimed to be the first all-female team in the ecosystem,” said Bored Becky, whose real name is Ashley Smith. “A month or so later, it was determined to be a lie. They were, in fact, men posing as women and then eventually posing to be other minority groups.”  Smith, along with a fellow Fame Ladies Squad holder who goes by NFTignition, decided to step into leadership after the original founders admitted the truth. Before deleting their social media accounts and disappearing, the founders conducted a Twitter poll asking whether they should transfer ownership of the Fame Lady Squad smart contract. More than 75% of respondents voted “yes,” and Fame Lady Squad transferred the contract to @digitalartchick, a respected personality in the space, who then transferred it to Smith through a third-party broker.  “I ended up with a smart contract for that entire collection,” Smith told CoinDesk.  Her motive for accepting the role was to help contribute positivity to the thousands of people who had joined the Fame Ladies Squad community around the false promise of representation. “For me, it was about rewriting the legacy of the first all-female project in the space,” said Smith, adding she wanted to encourage newcomers to “stick around.”  Beyond this, it was important for her to lead by example for her newfound community and show that authenticity and honesty are possible in Web3.  “Not everyone's here to suck the life and money from you, or to exploit your values,” she said.  Adding reality back to virtual reality  In December 2021, Web3 design studio Daz3D created Non-Fungible People (NFP), a collection of 8,888 avatar NFTs portraying women and nonbinary people with all ranges of abilities, ethnic backgrounds and characteristics.  “We were really trying to create a collection that was more like the world you see,” said Daz3D president Matt Wilburn. “We have avatars with Down syndrome. We have avatars that use prosthetics and that use wheelchairs,” Wilburn said.  He added that the company partnered with artists worldwide, including artists from the Greater Victoria Down Syndrome Society, in the making of the collection.  Through fashion and beauty partnerships, Daz3D has been able to proliferate these values of inclusion and representation throughout the metaverse. In June 2022, the design studio partnered with beauty brand Clinique on the “Metaverse Like Us” campaign, which dropped 8,888 female and non-binary avatars with customized virtual makeup looks.  Previously, Daz3D partnered with the Institute of Digital Fashion on a project to create Catty 8.1, a gender-non-conforming avatar modeled after the institute’s co-founder, Catty Tay.  Preserving queer culture in Web3  The Queer Museum of Digital Art (QMoDA) is a community dedicated to preserving arts and culture from transgender and queer creators on the blockchain. While it’s often easy to recognize blockchain’s importance in facilitating digital art ownership, it’s just as important to recognize the role of blockchain in cultural preservation, particularly for marginalized communities.  “The AIDS crisis, frankly, is the impetus of a lot of my work,” said artist and QMoDA organizer Zak Krevitt, who uses they/them pronouns. “Artists were dying. Family members and friends were tasked with the safekeeping of their art.”  Some of those art pieces stayed in private collections over the years, explained Krevitt, while another portion ended up in museums. “But there are limits,” they explained. “If someone has an entire artist's studio of work and it’s all physical, where does it all go?”  When Krevitt learned about blockchain, they saw an important pathway to cultural preservation – by encouraging artists and collectors to speak openly about the opportunities blockchain creates for LGBTQ+ artists, despite cultural or political systems that would otherwise prevent them.  “There's this unspoken but largely felt pressure within the NFT space to stay apolitical because [Web3] is so decentralized,” they explained. “Being queer and trans is very political right now,” they said, adding that the rise in anti-trans legislation proposals in the U.S. has added to the polarization.  To combat this tension and support both emerging and established queer NFT artists, QMoDA launched in January 2023 an artist grant program in partnership with NFT minting platform Zora. Ten artists were nominated to receive 1 ETH (about $1,600) each and invited to create an editioned work on the Ethereum blockchain. The QMoDA board nominated five artists, and those artists subsequently nominated one artist each for a total of ten grant recipients. Upcoming artist exhibitions will include work from Tyler Givens, Laurel Charleston, Glitch of Mind and Kate The Cursed.  QMoDa also hosts a virtual gallery in Protoworld, an open multiplayer metaverse world where communities can gather for live events and exhibitions.  The future of Web3 tech and culture  While Web3 technology remains nascent, it is up to us to make sure we are shaping a digital future that upholds the values of diversity and inclusion.  “Marginalized people often suffer the most harm from unintended consequences of new technologies,” wrote University of Illinois doctoral candidate Breigha Adeyemo in 2021.  Web3 offers us the opportunity for a cultural reset. In some respects, there’s never been a better moment in time for prosocial ingenuity and radical imagination, a term associated with the American civil rights movement, grassroots organizing and speculative literature. Technologists routinely evoke Neal Stephenson’s science fiction novel “Snow Crash” when discussing the metaverse, and while the book has certainly influenced the development of virtual reality (VR) and digital currency, Web3 beckons us to go even deeper and consider the values driving our actions across digital landscapes.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Megan DeMatteo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/02/28/what-kind-of-culture-are-we-building-in-web3,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1a031832e56fa1d8987a1152433fb357e7c46f35-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Reuters reported earlier Tuesday that Visa is “slamming the brakes” on new partnerships with crypto-related firms as the industry is facing renewed scrutiny after the collapse of once-popular crypto exchange FTX.  A Visa spokesperson told CoinDesk that isn’t the case.  “The recent failures do not change our crypto strategy and focus to serve as a bridge, helping connect both platforms and technologies emerging in the crypto ecosystem,” the spokesperson said. “That is where we have been investing and plan to continue to invest.”  In a tweet on Tuesday, Visa’s head of crypto, Cuy Sheffield, said reports of Visa wanting to slow down partnerships with the crypto space are inaccurate, and he reiterated that Visa continues to partner with crypto companies.  “Despite the challenges and uncertainty in the crypto ecosystem, our view has not changed that fiat-backed digital currencies running on public blockchains have the potential to play an important role in the payments ecosystem,” Sheffield said.  Visa recently signed a long-term global partnership with crypto payments app Wirex to expand its footprint in Asia-Pacific (APAC) and the U.K., to bring more payment options to consumers.  Mastercard was also reported to be taking a step back in the crypto space. A spokesperson from Mastercard, however, told CoinDesk the company still intends to ""work with partners to bring relevant payments solutions and programs to market.""  The person added, ""Our efforts continue to be focused on the underlying blockchain technology and how that can be applied to help address current pain points and build more efficient systems for consumers and businesses.""

Nishad Singh, former FTX ( FTT-USD ) director of engineering, agreed to plead guilty to fraud charges at a hearing in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday. The charges include wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud on FTX customers, and conspiracy to commit commodities fraud. In connection with the guilty plea, Singh will forfeit certain assets received from FTX and its sister firm Alameda Research. Later in the day, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed separate charges against Singh. The SEC charged Singh with defrauding investors, while the CFTC's charges were fraud by misappropriation, and aiding and abetting fraud committed by FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX and Alameda. Both agencies alleged that Singh was responsible for creating software code underlying FTX that allowed customer funds to be diverted to Alameda. Also, as FTX neared collapse, the SEC alleged that Singh withdrew ~$6M from FTX for personal use, including the purchase of a multi-million dollar house. The CFTC said Singh does not contest his liability on its claims and agreed to a proposed consent order of judgment. Late last year, former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX co-founder Gary Wang - other members of Bankman-Fried's inner circle - pled guilty to fraud charges . Singh earlier engaged with prosecutors to seek a plea deal . Several former FTX executives hired lawyers to discuss cooperating with prosecutors, including Daniel Friedberg, FTX's former top counsel, Reuters noted .

Specifically, the bitcoin miner determined that it had incorrectly calculated impairment on a daily basis of its digital assets and it had incorrectly accounted for revenue from a bitcoin mining pool that it had participated in and operated in late 2021 and early 2022. Now that Marathon Digital ( MARA ) needs to restate its previously reported financial statements for 2021 and 2022, the company will not be able to file its 2022 annual 10-K statement by the filing deadline of March 1, it said in a filing. It cancelled its conference call for Q4 earnings and will postpone the publication of its financial results. The company said its method for calculating the impairment of digital assets, chiefly bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), on a daily basis using a standard cutoff time wasn't in compliance with a requirement that calls for the intraday low price to be used. Regarding the bitcoin mining pool's revenue recognition, Marathon ( MARA ) had determined that the company acted as an agent in the pool, which included a small number of unrelated third-party participants. As a result, it recorded revenue on a net basis, subtracting any revenue allocated to the third-party pool participants from its revenue as the operator of the pool. It later found out that its assessment was incorrect and should have concluded that it acted as principal. That means the company should have recorded gross revenue rather than net revenue. Marathon ( MARA ) now estimates that both its revenue and cost of revenue for the year ended Dec. 31, 2021 were understated. Revenue and cost of revenue, energy, hosting and other, are expected to increase in the restated 2021 numbers. The restatement of the impacted financial statement isn't expected to have any effect on total margin, operating income or net income in 2021 or any of the interim periods in 2021 or 2022, it said. Marathon Digital ( MARA ) also said it no longer operates a pool that includes third parties.

The federal regulators both claim FTX lied to the public about its degree of separation from Alameda Research, a prop trading shop founded by FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried, and the companies commingled corporate and customer funds and used these funds for various purposes, including its own investments and trading activities.  According to the CFTC complaint, Singh once shifted $8 billion in Alameda liabilities to a customer account to ""prevent Alameda from paying interest on its large outstanding balance.""  Other allegations include claims that Singh was among a group of FTX executives who workshopped Bankman-Fried's tweets claiming FTX was OK and its customers could be made whole just prior to FTX's filing for bankruptcy protection in November.  The SEC, for its part, alleges Singh moved funds around at Bankman-Fried's request to make it appear that FTX generated more revenue than it actually did in 2021.  ""In late 2021, when Bankman-Fried realized that FTX was $50 million short of his goal of earning [$1 billion] in annual revenue, he instructed Singh to transfer funds from another entity that he controlled, and to falsely characterize the $50 million as revenue that FTX earned throughout 2021,"" the SEC complaint said. ""Singh then backdated a series of fraudulent transfers, and later lied to auditors about the transfers and created false documentation to support those lies. He did so knowing that this information would later also be presented to investors and potential investors.""  In a statement, SEC Director of Enforcement Gurbir Grewal said, ""We allege that this was fraud, pure and simple: While on the one hand FTX touted its supposed effective risk mitigation measures to investors, on the other Mr. Singh and his co-defendants were stealing customer funds using software code Mr. Singh helped create.""

42414288,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB3qdd,1677605021,French National Assembly Votes for Tougher Registration Rules for Crypto Firms,"Crypto firms will face tougher rules to register in France as of January, under plans voted on by the National Assembly on Tuesday that are now set to pass into law.  Lawmakers voted 109-71 in favor of rubber-stamping plans, already approved by the Senate, that will see extra requirements on internal controls, cybersecurity and conflicts of interest.  The new rules have been introduced in the wake of recent market turmoil, and as the country prepares for the arrival of new laws from the European Union.  France is hoping to set itself up as a crypto hub, and companies such as Binance and Bitstamp have already successfully registered with France’s Financial Markets Authority (AMF). Registration involves checks on governance and money laundering norms, and is mandatory for all those offering trading or custody services in the country. No firm has so far gained a license, a more burdensome procedure than registration of complying with financial norms.  Strengthening France’s regime was originally proposed by Senator Hervé Maurey in December, who cited the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange and the need to avoid loopholes in the period before the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) takes effect. The industry feared his plan was unworkable and damaging, though regulators themselves supported the move.  In the end, both chambers of the French parliament have settled on a compromise proposal that adds extra registration requirements as of January 2024, but doesn’t force companies to seek a license.

42421354,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnsmT,1677604582,The Future of Crypto Markets Will Be Driven by Developments in the East,"As political experts focus on the diplomatic dance amid building tensions between the United States and China (punctuated by some balloon-shaped comic relief that might end up being not so funny after all), a more benign battle is brewing in the halls of financial regulators. While local for now, nothing stays local for long in global markets. The potential ramifications go well beyond crypto markets, potentially shaping economic influence that, in this changing landscape, is more geostrategically important than ever.  Earlier this week, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) published the proposed text of its upcoming crypto regulation, slated to go into effect on June 1, and opened it up for public comment. Its scope includes the licensing of crypto-asset service platforms, which were originally only going to be allowed to service accredited investors. The SFC is now seeking input on whether or not retail investors should also be allowed to participate, and what types of protections should be in place. Also open for discussion is the range of “approved” assets, which in principle would only include a limited selection of the most liquid tokens.  So far, this seems like yet another example of a jurisdiction way ahead of the United States in terms of regulatory clarity and willingness to engage with the public on the topic. Yet, lifting the lid a little, it is so much more. It is also an example of the East-West strategy divide, the power of retail and the importance of watching the flows.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  Hong Kong’s crypto-friendly overtures  Not that long ago, Hong Kong was not exactly welcoming to crypto businesses, but nor was it overtly antagonistic. It seemed to regard them as largely inconsequential, in contrast to China’s building antagonism. In 2020, Hong Kong announced plans to introduce a new licensing regime to directly regulate all crypto platforms and to limit their reach to accredited investors. This recent move seems not only to clarify those promises but also to broaden the scope and take into account what the regulators see as growing retail interest.  Yet, it's about more than licensing. Hong Kong has also budgeted HK$50 million (~$6.4 million) for crypto asset development, including education efforts for individuals and businesses. And Hong Kong's financial secretary, Paul Chan, announced the launch of a task force composed of policy and industry representatives to explore crypto asset integration. This feels much broader and longer-term than just crypto service provider oversight.  In part, it’s about laying some groundwork for the economic growth of the region. Hong Kong’s economy depends largely on financial services and tourism from the mainland, both of which were hit hard by the strict COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. It recently reported its fourth consecutive quarterly GDP contraction, and the region’s Chief Executive John Lee has vowed to prioritize attracting foreign talent. Most crypto firms based in Hong Kong left as China’s 2021 crypto trading and mining ban cast a cloud of operational uncertainty. Now, several have announced they will be applying to return.  It's also about more than just Hong Kong and its 7 million residents. Hong Kong is obviously closely affiliated with China. The two jurisdictions operate under the constitutional principle of “one country, two systems,” which separates Hong Kong’s economic administration from that of its much larger parent. But events leading up to and during the recent protests made clear to the world that China holds the reins, and that nothing happens in Hong Kong without China’s approval.  Here’s where it gets particularly interesting: China seems to approve of Hong Kong’s crypto moves.  Crypto markets play out under China’s watchful eye  Earlier last week, Bloomberg reported that Chinese officials had been seen at Hong Kong crypto events. They were not undercover. In January, Huang Yiping, a former member of the monetary policy committee of China’s central bank, said in a public speech the country should reconsider its crypto ban. He was not speaking on behalf of the central bank, but it is extremely unlikely his speech would have become public without official approval.  None of this necessarily means that mainland China will be opening up to crypto markets any time soon – but it could be that China is watching Hong Kong’s moves with a view to relaxing its stance and eventually supporting the integration of global crypto assets into its economy.  This matters, in part, because of size. There are no small numbers in China, and the sheer scale of the potential participant pool could dwarf virtually any market. The country reportedly has 212 million retail investors – for comparison, the entire population of the United States is approximately 330 million. Many of these investors have withdrawn from the stock market given the economic uncertainty during the dark lockdown period, but with the improving outlook some of the buildup of pandemic savings could be looking for high returns.  What’s more, Chinese retail investors tend to be less risk-averse than their U.S. counterparts. In general, they prefer momentum chasing to steady yields, which, in part, explains their enthusiasm for crypto markets a few years ago and why the potential risk of a wipeout grew to the stage where the government felt the need to close off access. It did not manage to completely stamp out crypto activity, however – 8% of FTX’s creditors are mainland-based, according to the filings, and China-based miners could account for approximately 20% of global hashrate, according to the most recent study of bitcoin mining published by Cambridge.  Also, China is one of the few regions of the world actively easing money supply. Earlier this month, the central bank ramped up liquidity injections while keeping the monetary policy rate steady, but analysts expect the committee to continue to cut rates in the second quarter. The number of new loans extended by Chinese banks more than tripled between December and January. Most of us don’t have to cast our memories too far back to remember what monetary easing can do for risk assets.  China vs. the US: Two different styles of gamesmanship  It also matters, in part, because of geopolitics. It is no secret that China would like to see a weakening of the dollar’s international role without actually hurting the dollar, and it seems to understand that the role of U.S. capital markets is a key factor in global trade. For a few years now financial regulators have been working to encourage more activity on Chinese markets, such as opening them more to foreign investors, enabling more hedging, streamlining onshore listing requirements and boosting trade settled in yuan.  Allowing the opening of crypto markets could, of course, encourage more flows out of the yuan, which the Chinese authorities would understandably prefer to avoid. But if crypto assets and the innovation they bring are going to be key to the development of the financial markets of tomorrow, then China would obviously want some influence. Furthermore, China is probably watching with interest the building antagonism toward crypto from Washington, D.C. If the U.S. sees crypto markets as a threat, it could be a threat worth exploring.  This is representative of the typical strategic approaches of the two economic superpowers. I once heard someone compare the relative philosophies to board games popular in each region. In the U.S. they play chess, where you win by killing your opponent’s leader. In China they prefer Go, where you win by conquering and holding onto territory. It could be that Chinese leaders see crypto assets as a territory play, with global financial markets as the playing field. Rather than an enemy to be weakened, crypto markets could be a strategic pillar of a new world order, or at the very least an opportunity to attract global capital, talent and prestige.  So far this year, analysts have been focusing on macro factors as the main driver of crypto market performance, with evolving use cases and technical speculation also a feature of the recovery. It could be that a more significant driver is slowly building on the global strategy stage – specifically, in the geopolitical rivers of the east.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | MINING,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/02/28/the-future-of-crypto-markets-will-be-driven-by-developments-in-the-east,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7ab5e5f4a3da1f70132cf1df883c53550b50df79-3840x2560.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The digital investment company’s application to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot bitcoin ETF was denied in June, so Grayscale took the SEC to court. On March 7 the sides are set to make their arguments to federal judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Grayscale’s team will contend the regulators had a constrained role here and didn’t follow logic in its rejection after having approved several futures ETFs with similar risk profiles. Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.  “They don’t have a blank check,” said Donald B. Verrilli Jr., the former U.S. Solicitor General enlisted by Grayscale to help in the legal challenge, during a press briefing on Tuesday. “It’s just a classic case of taking like cases and treating them differently.”  In its rejection of Grayscale's bitcoin ETF, the SEC cited worries over market manipulation, and noted a lack of a surveillance-sharing agreement between a ""regulated market of significant size"" and a regulated exchange, repeating a concern it has expressed each time it denied similar spot bitcoin ETF applications from Grayscale and others companies.  “You’ve got all these approved [futures] ETFs out there functioning now,” said Verrilli, and the SEC’s logic in approving those relied on an assumption that manipulation protections – which he said also rely on spot market ties – were adequate.  As for the industry’s recent dramas, he said that “is going to be in the air,” but he said he’d be surprised if it became a direct element in next week’s arguments. He said this particular panel of three judges will “deal with the specifics,” and he added that “the more you get into the specifics, the stronger our case gets.”  Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein has said that if the ETF avenue reaches a dead end, the company is weighing a tender offer to redeem shares of the trust.  Craig Salm, Grayscale’s chief legal officer, said the case has obvious major implications on bitcoin and that “winning it would be very good” for that market. But if the company loses, he said they’ll fully exhaust appeals – even if that takes it to the U.S. Supreme Court.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/28/grayscale-to-argue-secs-inconsistency-as-bitcoin-etf-dispute-heads-toward-court,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/579bfbc3ffc0cd1aec65bbebea678dc21a6caeae-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414287,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB3qNi,1677602959,Proposed Bitcoin Vault Feature Could Thwart Malicious Hackers,"Bitcoin developer James O’ Beirne has been quietly working on a feature that alerts users when someone tries to steal their bitcoin, then thwarts the theft by diverting funds to a more-secure wallet.  The feature is called a vault – a type of Bitcoin smart contract or “covenant” that puts constraints on how a bitcoin can be spent.  Vault users must broadcast two separate transactions in two different blocks before spending their bitcoin (BTC). An alert is issued after the first transaction (which has a time delay), allowing users to either approve the transaction or sweep the coins to an alternative wallet.  The feature requires a soft fork – a backwards-compatible change to the blockchain – and, if adopted, will be represented by the operational code (opcode) “op_vault” in Bitcoin Core, the primary software for connecting to the Bitcoin network.  “The hazard of custodying bitcoin is well-known,” O’Beirne wrote in his draft proposal. “This proposal introduces a mechanism that significantly mitigates the worst-case outcome of key compromise: coin loss.”  What’s different about op_vault?  O’Beirne’s proposal is not the first of its kind. A couple of years ago, Bitcoin developer Jeremy Rubin proposed CheckTemplateVerify (CTV) under Bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP) 119.  Much like op_vault, CTV also uses covenants to create vaults. The key difference is that while O’Beirne’s proposal is designed specifically for vaults, CTV is a more general tool that can be used to create vaults, payment pools and even reduce fees during periods of high transaction volume (a feature Rubin calls “congestion control”).  “CTV is more general than op_vault,” Bitcoin researcher John Light told CoinDesk in an interview. “You can still build a type of vault with CTV, but you can also do other things. You can do congestion control, you can do non-interactive Lightning channel opening. There are a few different applications that Jeremy has experimented with using CTV that aren't vaults.”  Currently, the fate of CTV is unclear. Rubin announced an indefinite hiatus from Bitcoin development last month.  'Speedy Trial'  The chatter around op_vault has been steadily increasing, but it’s not clear when the proposal will be merged into Bitcoin Core – if at all. Many proposals are debated and refined for years before being adopted or abandoned.  O’Beirne recommended Speedy Trial – the same process used to activate the 2021 Taproot upgrade – as the preferred method for activating op_vault. Speedy Trial allocates a three-month activation window for the Bitcoin network to reach a threshold of miners who signal support for a proposed upgrade. The upgrade is adopted only if that specific threshold is reached. The use of Speedy Trial isn’t without its detractors, some of whom believe it gives certain groups within the Bitcoin community too much influence.  “Taproot Speedy was a terrible idea,” tweeted Francis Pouliot, CEO of Bitcoin exchange, Bitcoin Bull. “The precedent for soft fork collusion between groups of ‘influential’ devs and miners.”  As to the fate of op_vault over the next few months, Light says “it is too soon to tell.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MINING | FORKS,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/28/proposed-bitcoin-vault-feature-could-thwart-malicious-hackers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2d80d898af47250a8d5ba0d4c5a010bdecf7b2ec-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414308,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB3pBQ,1677602551,Former FTX Engineering Director Nishad Singh Pleads Guilty to Criminal Charges: Reuters,"Former FTX Director of Engineering Nishad Singh pleaded guilty to six criminal charges in a New York court on Tuesday.  Singh, who worked with FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried at the defunct crypto exchange, was reported to have been looking for a plea deal with prosecutors last month. Singh pleaded guilty to charges including fraud and conspiracy. Reuters reported the news on Tuesday.  Bankman-Fried has been charged with 12 different counts, ranging from bank fraud to securities and commodities fraud to conspiracy to commit money laundering. He has pleaded not guilty and faces a trial this fall.  His fellow former executives Caroline Ellison, who used to helm prop trading shop Alameda Research, and Gary Wang, an FTX co-founder, have already pleaded guilty to fraud charges tied to FTX's collapse.  In a statement, Singh's lawyers said, “Nishad is deeply sorry for his role in this and has accepted responsibility for his actions. He wants to do everything he can to make things right for victims, including by assisting the government to the best of his ability in this case.”  Prosecutors have alleged FTX used Alameda's bank accounts to accept customer deposits, knowing banks would not want to provide services to a crypto exchange.  Other allegations included in an indictment of Bankman-Fried include claims the former FTX CEO and his colleagues used both encrypted and ephemeral messaging platforms (like Signal) to communicate, ""thereby preventing regulators and law enforcement from later obtaining a record"" of these communications.  Prosecutors further alleged that FTX customers' funds were misappropriated for various uses.  FTX collapsed in November after a CoinDesk report showed Alameda held an unusually large amount of FTT tokens, which were issued by FTX. Crypto exchange Binance announced it would sell its own FTT holdings, which spurred a domino effect ending in FTX filing for bankruptcy protection alongside nearly 100 subsidiaries and related companies.

Or disinvitations.  The latest example of this conference-watching dynamic went public this week as blockchain developers convened in Colorado ahead of ETHDenver, one of the year’s biggest events on the crypto circuit.  There were invitations, and then disinvitations. The takeaway appears to be that tensions are brewing between the projects Aptos and Sui – two blockchains that emerged, in part, from Facebook’s (now Meta Platforms') defunct Diem stablecoin project.  Officials at Pontem, a crypto wallet startup backed by the Aptos blockchain, are hosting the MoveCon conference later this week in the Aptos house, on the sidelines of ETHDenver. The focus of the event is Move, a coding language that Facebook engineers developed for Diem; it's also the base language for Aptos and Sui.  Initially, the Pontem team had asserted its conference was “dedicated” to both corners of the Move ecosystem. Sui representatives were invited.  ""We’re gathering the biggest projects from Aptos, Sui and the rest of the ecosystem for a three-day blockchain conference, a real celebration of everything Move,"" Pontem officials wrote in a Feb. 14 post about the event.  But according to people familiar with the matter – and some tweets – Pontem subsequently disinvited Sui Foundation attendees. One of the people said Aptos officials told Pontem organizers to exclude Sui speakers, although a handful of project founders working in the Sui ecosystem are already confirmed.  The disinvitation dis  A representative for Aptos said the organization had no role in Pontem’s speaker choices, or in organizing the conference. Pontem founder Alejo Pinto declined to comment.  “Sui Foundation will not be attending MoveCon on March 3-5,” Brian Hsieh, head of developer relations, said in a Telegram message shared with CoinDesk. “We have been informed by the host that we are no longer invited.”  Hsieh declined to comment when reached by CoinDesk.

42414284,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB3qIP,1677602332,Certain Banks' Crypto Exposure Dropped by 44% Globally in 2022 From Previous Year: BIS,"Banks across the globe lowered their exposure to certain cryptocurrencies by 43.6% over the past year, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said Tuesday.  Total exposure to cryptocurrencies – both to cryptos directly and via derivative exposure – dropped from 61.7% in 2021 to 15.4% in 2022, a report by the BIS Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) showed. The change in banks' crypto exposure was mostly due to fewer banks responding to the BIS survey but also other factors like market conditions and banks reducing their exposure possibly due to the BCBS’ global crypto banking rules, the report said. The sample of banks that got involved went down from 182 banks to 126 banks.  Not only has the crypto market experienced a severe crypto winter propelled by the collapse of large companies including crypto lender Celsius Network and crypto exchange FTX, which has led to millions being wiped out of the crypto market in a year, but regulators have also tightened their supervision, which has encouraged a contraction in crypto activity.  The BCBS, which sets global rules for banks, endorsed in December rules that a bank's exposure to certain cryptocurrencies must not exceed 2%. The committee also suggested that crypto holdings should be capped in June earlier that year.  The deadline to implement the crypto banking rules proposed by the BCBS is 2025, but this data suggests banks are already taking action.  Looking at total exposure in the Basel III monitoring exercise the share of crypto exposure “shrinks to 0.003% and 0.001% of total exposures, respectively,” the report said.

The funding round comes during a particularly harsh crypto winter landscape that has taken a toll on venture capital and other investments into the industry, which were down 91% year over year in January. Infrastructure projects emerged as one of the strongest sectors during the month.  San Francisco-based Portal offers wallet infrastructure and a decentralized application (dapp) store that enables projects to become a Web3-enabled app. The developer kit helps Portal partners easily connect to protocols and dapps either directly or from a mobile or desktop browser. Portal’s embedded wallet uses multi-party computation (MPC), a type of cryptography that removes the need for complicated seed phrases – a hurdle for non-crypto native users – without compromising security.  ""Web3 is fundamentally transforming every part of our lives - from how we make payments and access financial services to how we manage our data and assets in an increasingly connected world,"" said Slow Ventures partner Will Quist in the press release. ""However, the barriers to access this emerging ecosystem are high - for both enterprises and consumers alike. Portal has built transformative infrastructure to onboard the next wave of users into web3.""  Other backers in the round were Acrew Capital, Chapter One and a number of angel investors, including William Hockey (co-founder of fintech company Plaid), Henrique Dubagras (co-founder of corporate credit firm Brex), and Diogo Monica, founder of institutional crypto platform Anchorage Digital.  Portal was co-founded by CEO Raj Parekh, who previously directed Visa’s global crypto product division. The other founders bring a range of security engineering experience with Chief Technology Officer David Scrobonia having worked at Web2 consumer data platform Segment, Brex alum Parsa Attari and Rami Shahatit, who previously worked at fintech Blend.

Within the broader payments space, both companies have been instrumental in bringing crypto-focused products and services to market with the goal of attracting more customers.

42414275,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB3phG,1677596400,"Solana’s Spam Problems Persist Despite Tech Improvements, MEV Researchers Say","Despite efforts by Solana developers to discourage spammy transactions that could threaten to bog down the network, a majority of the network’s compute is still being wasted on failed trades, according to an analysis by crypto infrastructure company Jito Labs.  In one recent epoch (a time period on Solana roughly equivalent to two and a half days), arbitrage transactions took up 60% of overall compute space, per Jito. These transactions were attempts by bots to win slim margins on competitive trades – and 98% of their attempts failed.  The result is wasted blockspace for the network as well as capital burnt for no reason on losing trades, according to a blog post from Jito Foundation. It blames this on the way Solana’s infrastructure handles submitted transactions: give priority to the first in line. That creates an incentive for arbitrage bots to submit multiple duplicate transactions in the hopes they will get the winner.  Recent changes to Solana’s backend – particularly the introduction of priority fees and local fee markets – have changed the economics around spamming; and yet spam transactions will persist as long as MEV (maximal extractable value) opportunities remain, according to analysis by validator service Chorus One.  MEV refers to the methods through which traders can squeeze as much crypto as they can out of a given blockchain network, typically by previewing upcoming transactions and using this advanced information to squeeze in profitable trades.  Two popular strategies include winning arbitrage trades and fulfilling liquidation orders. On Ethereum, where MEV is a cottage industry, the network’s slower architecture and emphasis on fees combats spam transactions much more than Solana’s,  Jito Foundation is building a specialty client for the Solana network that optimizes for MEV, said the pseudonymous Buffalu, CEO of Jito Labs, which contributes to the work.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SOL,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/02/28/solanas-spam-problems-persist-despite-tech-improvements-mev-researchers-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f527c4fc6504ab51ad52b48aea7834c76166d33f-3886x2186.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421349,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnsgH,1677593745,Why Not Donate Dead NFT Wallets?,"It’s the nightmare of every NFT collector. In April 2021, Web3 impresario Farokh Samad lost the seed phrase of a wallet containing 87 non-fungible tokens, including an especially rare Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT. At the time, the total value of the collection was about 250 ether (ETH) or $850,000, but it might as well have been nothing. Without the seed phrase, Samad couldn’t access the wallet, so he couldn’t sell his NFTs.  Samad isn’t alone. Lots of NFT collectors have created wallets to buy NFTs and then lost the seed phrase, especially in the early days of the NFT market when no one realized it would take off. For example, one anonymous wallet contains 141 CryptoPunks NFTs. The owner of the wallet bought the tokens in 2017 for about $7 each, and today the collection is worth more than $100 million. But the wallet hasn’t been used since 2017, and everyone suspects the owner forgot the seed phrase. Oops.  Brian Frye is a law professor at the University of Kentucky and conceptual artist who works with NFTs.  Losing your seed phrase is the worst thing that can happen to an NFT collector. If a hacker steals your NFTs, at least there’s some chance of getting them back. But if you lose your seed phrase you still own your NFTs, you just can’t sell them. And an NFT you can’t sell is effectively worthless.  Or is it? Maybe there’s a workaround.  For better or worse, it was inevitable that art museums would start collecting NFTs. And many of them have. On Feb. 13, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art announced a donation of 22 NFTs worth millions of dollars from pseudonymous NFT collector Cozomo de’ Medici. And on Feb. 10, Le Centre Pompidou announced the acquisition of 18 NFTs by 13 artists.  Only later did NFT artist David Lisser observe that some of the NFTs acquired by the Pompidou hadn’t moved wallets.  Has the Pompidou actually acquired the NFTs if they aren’t in a Pompidou-owned wallet? Sure, why not. Museums don’t need physical custody of an artwork to own it any more than a collector does, and plenty of collectors buy and sell artworks that never leave a freeport warehouse. The same is true of NFTs. The Pompidou owned the NFTs as soon as they were donated. Transferring them to a Pompidou-owned wallet is only a formality.  There’s more. Maybe it’s wise for museums not to keep their NFTs in museum-owned wallets. After all, NFT theft is rampant, and museums are ripe targets. They’re new to the NFT market and vulnerable to the kind of tricks veteran NFT collectors have learned to avoid. Why not let NFT collectors hold donated NFTs in trust for museums, at least until the museums have developed the expertise to properly safeguard them?  Read more: NFTs Are Securities and It’s Great | Opinion  Here’s where it gets interesting. If museums can acquire NFTs without transferring them to museum-owned wallets, why can’t they acquire NFTs in dead wallets? When you lose the seed phrase of an NFT wallet you can’t transfer the NFT to a different wallet but you still own the NFT.  Sure, the NFT market doesn’t value non-transferrable NFTs in dead wallets, which are de facto “soulbound” tokens, by virtue of their owner’s forgetfulness. But museums might. In fact, they might be perfect for museums.  ‘Deaccessioning rules’  The Association of Art Museum Directors (AAMD) has created deaccessioning rules that prohibit art museums from selling an artwork in their collection for any purpose other than buying another artwork. Despite the incoherence and legal unenforceability of the AAMD’s rules, art museums still try to observe them, and the self-appointed deaccessioning police lose their minds whenever museums sell artworks they consider important, even when the museums are trying to diversify their collections.  The blockchain is forever and transfer consists of nothing more than the collector saying, “I give you this wallet.”  Whatever. Let’s take deaccessioning rules seriously, even if they don’t deserve it. If museums aren’t supposed to sell art because they merely hold it in the “public trust,” how do we stop them? I recently suggested that museums should send their NFTs to a “burn address” in order to prevent deaccessioning by making them truly a part of the museum’s “permanent collection.” But acquiring dead wallets containing important NFTs accomplishes exactly the same thing.  Think of the advantages! Collectors will be delighted to donate dead NFT wallets to museums. Museums won’t have to do anything in order to accession or preserve the NFTs. The blockchain is forever and transfer consists of nothing more than the collector saying, “I give you this wallet.” Deaccessioning is impossible. And even better, so is theft! Dead wallets will be the only asset museums don’t even have to insure.  Of course, there are still some questions. The most important is whether the unlucky collectors who own dead wallets will benefit from the gift. At the very least, they’ll have the pleasure of knowing their NFTs belong to a museum. And maybe they can even take a tax deduction for the donation!  Taxation without theft  I suspect the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will resist deductions for donations of dead wallets because the owner can’t actually sell them. But its own decisions say otherwise. When New York art dealer Ileana Sonnabend died in 2007, her children inherited a Robert Rauschenberg combine titled “Canyon,” among many other things. Unfortunately, Canyon incorporates a stuffed bald eagle, and federal law makes it illegal to sell bald eagles. Accordingly, Sonnabend’s children couldn’t legally sell Canyon, so Christie’s valued it at $0.  The IRS didn’t care. It valued Canyon at $65 million and ordered the Sonnabend estate to pay $29.2 million in taxes. Eventually, the IRS agreed to waive the tax bill if the Sonnabends donated Canyon to a charitable organization. It now belongs to the Museum of Modern Art.  So the IRS is on record as saying that an artwork has taxable value even if it can’t be sold. Presumably an NFT in a dead wallet also has taxable value. If so, there’s no obvious reason the owner can’t donate it to a museum, just like the Sonnabends. Sure, they won’t get the full value of the NFT. But something is better than nothing. And it would be a great way for art museums to build a low-cost, unstealable, impossible to deaccession collection of important NFTs.

42414293,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB3qoF,1677592233,Bitcoin at Risk of Deeper Pullback Toward $20K: Chart Analysts,"Bitcoin's (BTC) recent technical failure at key price resistance has raised the risk of a deeper pullback, according to analysts studying price charts.  The leading cryptocurrency's upswing has recently stalled, with prices failing to crack resistance at $25,200, which capped the August bounce.  ""Bitcoin has been unable to break out above trading range resistance near $25.2K, resulting in a whipsaw lower for the daily MACD,"" Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner at Fairlead Strategies, said in a note to clients on Monday, using the acronym for ""moving average divergence/convergence,"" an indicator used to gauge trend strength and trend changes. ""Given the MACD 'sell' signal, and with room to oversold levels per the daily stochastics, we shift to a bearish short-term bias.""  Stockton expects bitcoin to revisit $20,000 after brief stabilization at around the 50-day simple moving average, currently at $22,567. At press time, bitcoin was changing hands near $23,500.  The MACD histogram has recently dropped below zero, indicating a bearish shift in momentum. Aficionados of technical analysis consider MACD's bearish shift to be a sell signal.  Meanwhile, the stochastic indicator, used to gauge overbought and oversold conditions, is yet to fall below 30, implying room for price declines. A reading below 30 indicates an asset is oversold and usually marks an end to price drops.  According to Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, bitcoin's weekly chart also favors a deeper pullback.  ""Technically, bitcoin is selling off after touching its 200-week moving average. And due to the negative momentum at the end of the week, it has also fallen below the 50-week moving average. This dynamic may be a prologue to further declines, a predictable tug-of-war near trend levels,"" Kuptsikevich said in an email on Monday.  Bitcoin has turned lower from its 200-week simple moving average (SMA) after facing rejection above the same for two consecutive weeks.  The 50-week SMA has dropped below the 200-week SMA, producing what is known as the ""death cross,"" a bearish development.  The expected price decline, however, would be a temporary bull breather, according to Kuptsikevich.  ""A pullback in bitcoin to $21.5K would remain a correction within a bull market, but a sharp drop below that level could force a reassessment of whether we are out of a bear market,"" Kuptsikevich said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/28/bitcoin-risks-deeper-pullback-toward-20k-chart-analysts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/10191e9860549477b8471221b986f69530642c3b-4928x3264.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Startups will have access to proprietary technologies provided by Meta AI, and they will also be given commercial support by both Meta and Telefonica.  Coinbase (COIN) will suspend trading of binance USD (BUSD) starting March 13 because the stablecoin doesn’t meet its listing standards, the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange announced in a tweet Monday. “Our determination to suspend trading for BUSD is based on our own internal monitoring and review processes,” a spokesperson told CoinDesk. “When reviewing BUSD, we determined that it no longer met our listing standards and will be suspended.” The suspension affects Coinbase.com, Coinbase Pro, Coinbase Exchange and Coinbase Prime. Users will still be able to access their BUSD funds and withdraw them at any time, Coinbase said.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows daily inflows into bitcoin whale addresses since July 2022.

Jon Cunliffe, the central bank’s deputy governor for financial stability, said it was now “more likely than not” that a digital version of the British pound would be needed. He said this while answering questions from the House of Commons Treasury Committee over a recent consultation on the issue.  The bank is trying “to see how trends in the economy, in payments, in society and in technology will play out” before taking any decision on whether to issue a central bank digital currency, Cunliffe said, referring to the prospect that payments could be much more deeply integrated into online functions.  But Cunliffe cast doubt on claims by lawmaker Anne Marie Morris that a CBDC – whether used as a substitute for retail cash or large-scale for transactions between financial institutions – could be based on the kind of innovations that underpin cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.  “Distributed ledger technology suffers with some real challenges on scalability,” Cunliffe said, with any system needing to be secure and fast. “On the retail side of it, we put in 30,000 transactions per second as a base case, going to 100,000. I don't think you can find any distributed ledger technology that gets remotely close to that.”  “I'm not saying it can't,” he said. “But what a crypto firm or a new payment firm has demonstrated – a proof of concept – is a very different thing to scaling up to using economy-wide or cross-border.”  Even if payment innovations don’t always stand up to central bank scrutiny, Cunliffe said they could have other applications, such as to mediate the sale and registration of real estate.  “We're running projects with the BIS [Bank for International Settlements] Innovation Hub, about a synchronization agent that will be able to synchronize, not just with the financial sector, but within the Land Registry,” he said, referring to Project Meridian, which is looking to develop an intermediary platform that settles directly in central bank money.  The Land Registry is a U.K. government agency that records who owns real estate.  Tokenized assets can be used to make a “house purchase without having to have solicitors and escrow,” Cunliffe said. “There's a lot of experimentation going on.”  Read more: Digital Pound Holdings Could Be Limited to 10K, Central Bank Says  Camomile Shumba contributed reporting.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/28/dlt-not-efficient-enough-to-power-cbdcs-boes-cunliffe,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ceeb008f457a41413320bf951182b6ea3134edb-3000x1999.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414280,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB3qD6,1677589200,Institutional DeFi Startup Hashnote Is First to Emerge From Incubator Cumberland Labs,"Decentralized asset management platform Hashnote, the first company to be launched by Web3 incubator Cumberland Labs, joins the current trend for grown-up, institutional-grade decentralized finance (DeFi).  Hashnote, which simplifies much of DeFi’s complexity and comes compliant with things such as know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, is backed with $5 million of investment from Cumberland Labs, which came out of stealth mode in July. Chicago-based crypto trading giant Cumberland – the crypto trading firm affiliated with diversified trading firm DRW – will be the first of a select group of market makers on the platform.  Decentralized lending and trading stayed robust amid last year’s collapsing dominoes of centralized crypto companies, but the DeFi space has lacked the kind of traditional finance-like infrastructure to which big institutions are accustomed. This made Hashnote’s traditional finance (TradFi) offering feel like an easy sell, said the firm’s founder and CEO Leo Mizuhara in an interview with CoinDesk.  ""Last year showed the crypto space wasn’t run by adults, but rather some of these young personalities who’ve never really spent much time in finance,” Mizuhara said. “After spending 12 years at Bank of America mostly directly reporting to the chief investment officer, I joined DRW where I ran the systematic options trading group. And when I came up with the idea for Hashnote, Don Wilson [DRW founder and CEO] loved the idea, wanted to fund it immediately and had a term sheet in front of me within a week.”  Hashnote is regulated in the U.S. by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a commodity pool operator (CPO). Internationally, Hashnote is registering under the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA) which means all its funds are KYC’d and fully whitelisted, Mizuhara said.  Cumberland Labs is an independent entity based in Singapore, said the incubator’s head of strategy Tama Churchouse.  “We’re not a subsidiary of Cumberland but obviously work closely with companies like DRW,” said Churchouse in an interview. “We work with external founders, where typically there is a large first check investment for a substantial equity position in companies where we can add a genuine competitive advantage with Cumberland and DRW. That means a deep involvement in trading, market making, engineering algorithmic systems, low latency, the whole nine yards.”  CORRECTION (Feb. 28 15:09 UTC): Corrected to indicate that Hashnote is registering under the CIMA but has not won registration yet, and that Mizhuhara mostly directly reported to the chief investment officer while at Bank of America, but was not the deputy CIO.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/02/28/institutional-defi-startup-hashnote-is-first-to-emerge-from-incubator-cumberland-labs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8cfc3ba1b54cefc06bbafc9e627a13535791128f-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42414278,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB3prs,1677589200,Fixed Income DeFi Platform Term Finance Readies for Business,"Term Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol for fixed interest borrowing, is preparing to go live around the end of March, and is looking to reassure institutional investors in the wake of last year’s crypto scandals.  Term Labs, the platform's builder, raised $2.5 million in a seed round led by Electric Capital with participation from Coinbase Ventures, Circle Ventures, Robot Ventures and MEXC Ventures. There was also angel investment from the founders of DeFi stalwarts Aura, Balancer, Hashlow and Llama.  Centralized lending operations blew up last year, but the DeFi sector, where funds are transparently locked in tamper-proof digital contracts, remained largely intact. While decentralized lending has mostly been confined to over-collateralized, crypto-backed loans with variable rates, some participants now see opportunity in bringing fixed-rate lending and interest-rate derivatives to DeFi.  “If you think about traditional finance, short-term borrowing and lending, fully over-collateralized, typically backed by Treasurys or mortgage-backed securities is the lubricant of the entire financial market,” Term Labs CEO Dion Chu said in an interview. “We’re trying to create the same money market for the DeFi space. The goal is a sort of benchmark yield curve for the DeFi space, which currently doesn’t exist.”  In addition, Term Labs’ auction model originates loans at scale without slippage, bid-offer spread or other hidden transaction costs seen in other lending protocols, said Electric Capital partner Ken Deeter in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,BAL | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/02/28/fixed-income-defi-platform-term-finance-readies-for-business,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/90ded3a9942dd1cb6ab94a09417cdb294620dd33-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company has also made many strategic partnerships. AVAX could reach a price of over $200 in the next bull run. Overview Avalanche (AVAX-USD), developed and launched by Ava Labs in 2018, is an EVM-compatible layer-1 blockchain that aims to digitize all the world's assets. Avalanche's native token AVAX has been a top 50 coin on CoinMarketCap and is on the watchlist of hundreds of thousands of people. Despite reaching an all-time high price of $146.22 in the 2021 crypto bull run, the price of AVAX declined due to the months-long bear market in 2022. Despite the bear market and the subsequent correction of prices of crypto tokens, the implosions, hacks, and overall turbulent moments experienced in the crypto space in 2022, Avalanche weathered the storm and had a surge in its network usage. Growth and Ecosystem Blockchain analytics platform Nansen released an Avalanche-focused report for the fourth quarter of 2022, shared with CoinDesk. According to CoinDesk, the Nansen report reveal that transactions on the avalanche blockchain grew by 1,500% in 2022. The transaction count includes non-fungible trading (NFT) trading volume on the Avalanche blockchain. However, Avalanche's DeFi protocols have experienced a decline in the total number of locked tokens. Avalanche is popular for its ability to create and execute EVM-compatible smart contracts, low transaction fees, and fast throughput - one-second transaction finality. The core elements blockchain users seek are speed, fast throughput, and low fees - for which Avalanche is popular. Despite crypto winter, a spike in the number of transactions shows that the Avalanche is a practical blockchain. Avalanche's ecosystem has grown organically since its creation. Several quality blockchain projects have deployed application-specific blockchains, known as subnets, on Avalanche. Blockchain projects can launch subnetworks (subnets) on Avalanche; these subnets have their own set of validator nodes, choose any token as their native token, set their gas prices, and set specific rules on the subnetwork. Subnets in the Avalanche ecosystem work together to validate the main Avalanche blockchain. In April 2022, prominent GameFi project Defi Kingdoms (DFK) introduced Crystalvale Realm, deployed as an Avalanche subnet. On November 13, 2022, the DFK subnet reached 200 million transactions. The surge in transactions on subnets, like Crystalvale, deployed on Avalanche has contributed significantly to the increase in transaction volume on the Avalanche blockchain. NFTs on Avalanche also gained traction in recent times. In October 2022, the world's leading NFT marketplace OpenSea launched support for Avalanche NFTs. The exposure and increased trading volume that NFTs minted on Avalanche gained by OpenSea's integration also contributed to the Avalanche's transaction upsurge. Home of Digital Securities Avalanche has stated that its goal is to tokenize the world's assets. One of the digital asset classes that have gained rising popularity is digital securities or securities tokens. These tokens are digitized investment contracts representing real-world assets such as stocks, bonds, real estate, or commodities. Digital securities run on blockchain technology, and Avalanche has become one of the go-to networks for issuing security tokens. Leading security tokens issuing platform Securitize was the first security token platform to integrate with Avalanche. Securitize announced its integration with Avalanche in December 2020. Securitize called the integration a time- and cost-saving upgrade for blockchain-based financial services offerings. The Avalanche integration has enabled issuers utilizing the Securitize platform to issue and manage private securities cost-efficiently using the Avalanche blockchain. Since integrating Avalanche, Securitize has tokenized KKR's Health Care Strategic Growth Fund II, a $4 billion healthcare-focused fund, on the Avalanche blockchain, among other real-world asset tokenization efforts. In December 2022, regulated digital securities and cryptocurrency trading platform INX announced that it would fully integrate its platform with Avalanche to expand its infrastructure for security token issuers. Another digital securities firm that plans to have an Avalanche integration is DEFYCA. The firm announced a soon-to-launch cross-chain liquidity aggregator utilizing Avalanche as its treasury chain. DEFYCA chose Avalanche because of the network's unique fusion of multichain technology. Recent Partnerships Ava Labs is one of the few blockchain companies that attract meaningful partnerships in the blockchain industry due to the quality of its blockchain network. Recently, Tencent Cloud, a Chinese cloud computing service and creators of WeChat, formed a strategic partnership with Ava Labs. The partnership will provide technical support to developers and projects building on the Avalanche blockchain. Developers and projects in the Avalanche ecosystem can deploy nodes rapidly on Tencent's cloud infrastructure. Developers on Tencent also have access to Avalanche blockchain development tools like rapid node deployment. Another note-worthy partnership secured by Avalanche in 2023 is its Amazon Web Services (AWS) partnership. According to Avalanche, the partnership aims to ease the processes of node deployment and subnet creation. Developers and enterprises would have access to one-click tools to deploy nodes and subnets. The Avalanche-AWS partnership has been scrutinized and criticized by a faction of crypto Twitter , calling it ""a service agreement presented as a partnership."" The official Twitter handle of Avalanche tweeted the announcement; however, AWS' tweet did not explicitly mention a partnership. Technical Analysis If we look at the long-term chart, my view is that AVAX could reach at least $274 in the next bull run. AVAX TA (Author's work) This target is reached by measuring the length of the wave 1 from the bottom of wave 2. This is done using the arithmetic chart, since the logarithmic chart yields too bullish a target for my liking. AVAX TA (Author's work) Looking at the recent rally off the lows, I think we should head a bit lower in wave 2, perhaps towards the $15 region. If this is done and we can rally impulsively over the recent high at $22, then I will assume a low is already in, which isn't completely certain yet. Takeaway The digital securities market is projected to reach $162 trillion in trading volume by 2030. Asset tokenization is gaining traction, traditional investors are exploring and adopting digital securities quickly, and firms are adopting the issuance of security tokens for crowdfunding. Blockchain projects like Avalanche that focus on the tokenization of assets are the pillars of the digital securities sector. As the digital securities sector grows, these blockchains will experience massive userbase and value growth.",POSITIVE,AVAX,AVAX | BLOCKCHAIN | ICO | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4582718-avalanche-avax-follow-the-user-growth?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/10089443.jpeg

It notes that these cryptocurrencies and small-cap liquid tokens have led this year’s rally.  Bank of America strategists remain cautious on growth, as strong economic data has delayed the timing of a recession and also “indicates the potential for reflation and additional rate hikes.”  “Given that January’s risk asset rally was partially driven by short-covering and mean reversion, the likely higher-for-longer rate environment may result in pressure for growth and, therefore, digital assets,” analysts Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss wrote.  Shorting is a way of betting that a price will decline. An investor borrows a security and sells it in the hope that the price will drop. They then repurchase the security and return it to the lender. Mean reversion is a theory used in finance that suggests asset prices tend to revert to their long-term mean or average level.

42414299,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB46O1,1677582000,Non-Custodial Liquid Staking Platform Ether.Fi Closes $5.3M Fundraise,"Ether.Fi, a decentralized and non-custodial liquid staking platform, said it closed a $5.3 million fundraising round.  Liquid staking, which allows users to earn rewards for locking cryptocurrency to validate a blockchain network while retaining the ability to invest the locked funds elsewhere, recently replaced decentralized finance as the second largest crypto sector, with a total value locked of around $14 billion.  That's a sign ether (ETH) holders taking a keen interest in liquid staking platforms even as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sets its sights on staking in the U.S. But these platforms are custodial and centralized, making them vulnerable to many of the same threats as Coinbase and Kraken.  Ether.Fi’s answer is to allow users to maintain control of their keys while delegating Ethereum validator operations to a node operator.  ""The EtherFi protocol empowers users to maintain custody over their assets, without sacrificing composability,"" founder and CEO Mike Silagadze said in a statement. ""I strongly believe that stakers retaining control of their keys is a critical aspect of a decentralized protocol, and it helps reduce counterparty risk.""  Every validator generated through its protocol will be represented as a non-fungible token (NFT). Ethereum stakers depositing a minimum of 32 ETH will hold the NFT, which represents an economic interest in the validator. Once liquidity pool and protocol treasury management smart contracts are implemented, this NFT can be fractionalized.  Arthur Hayes, the founder of the BitMEX crypto exchange, points to Ether.Fi’s non-custodial model as the reason why Maelstrom, his family office, invested in the protocol.  “The majority of today’s ETH staking protocols – which, even after Shanghai, will require node operators to voluntarily return stakers’ assets upon request – could pose a serious threat to the ETH ecosystem if they were to fail,” Hayes said in a statement to CoinDesk, referring to Ethereum's Shanghai upgrade that's due next month. “[Ether.fi] will enable stakers to maintain true custody of their own assets as part of its mission to eliminate staker, node operator, counterparty, and ecosystem risks across proof-of-stake networks.”  Ether.Fi’s team says they are aiming to have 100,000 ether staked by mid-2023.

42414312,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB47fc,1677577318,Crypto Traders Worried About Liquidity Thinning in Bitcoin and Ether,"Liquidity conditions in the bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) markets continue to worsen, and the situation is now more alarming than it was three months ago. That has traders worried about abrupt price swings in the crypto market.  Liquidity refers to the ability of the market to absorb large buy and sell orders at stable prices. The commonly used metric for assessing liquidity conditions is 2% of market depth – a collection of buy and sell offers within 2% of the mid-price or the average of the bid and the ask/offer prices.  More significant the depth, the more liquid an asset is said to be, and vice versa.  Data from Paris-based crypto data provider Kaiko show bitcoin's 2% market depth for USDT pairs aggregated from 15 centralized exchanges has slipped to 6,800 BTC, the lowest since May 2022 when the Terra network collapsed and below the level that followed the demise of crypto exchange FTX. It's down significantly from the October highs of above 15,000 BTC. Ether's 2% market depth has more than halved to 57,000 ETH since October, led by Binance.  ""Thin liquidity means more drastic moves, particularly in alternative cryptocurrencies,"" Matthew Dibb, chief investment officer at Astronaut Capital, said.  ""Funds trying to trade size are forced to TWAP over longer periods (days or weeks) hence why it looks like some charts have recently been 'walked up' such as STX,"" Dibb added.  TWAP, or time-weighted average price, is an algorithmic strategy focused on achieving an average trade execution price close to the time-weighted average price of the asset. In other words, it involves breaking a large order into smaller quantities and executing those at regular intervals to minimize the impact on the going market and reduce slippage.  Slippage is the difference between the expected price at which a trade is placed and the actual price at which the buy/sell transaction is executed. Slippage usually occurs when there is low market liquidity or high volatility.  ""Realistically, though, dwindling market depth has also meant that most large funds have not been participating at the same level as previous due to the amount of slippage associated,"" Dibb noted, adding that any large institution that offloads coins now is going to have a deeper effect on the market.  The latest decline in the market depth comes amid dwindling volatility expectations in the bitcoin market. This kind of situation often leads to sudden explosion in volatility, according to Griffin Ardern, a trader from crypto asset-management firm Blofin.  The Bitcoin Volatility Index (BVIN), which measures the implied or expected volatility over the next 30 days, has declined to 56.39, its lowest level since at least early 2021, according to data source CryptoCompare.  Bitcoin's seven-day variance risk premium, or the difference between the seven-day implied volatility and seven-day realized volatility, has flipped negative, according to data tracked by Amberdata. It shows short-term volatility expectations are underpriced.  ""An environment conducive to high volatility is being created,"" Ardern said. ""And because the depth is low, it only takes a small amount [buy/sell order] to influence the price, and the resulting hedging activity of market makers to amplify market volatility through hedging.""  Market makers always take the opposite side of investors' trades and maintain a market-neutral portfolio by buying and selling the underlying asset as the price swings. Their hedging activity is known to influence the bitcoin's spot market price and could have an outsized impact this time, thanks to low market depth.  The crypto market liquidity began drying up in mid-November after Alameda Research and FTX went bust. Alameda was one of the most prominent market makers, providing billions of dollars in liquidity to small- and large-cap tokens. The resulting contagion brought down several trading desks, including Arbitrage and high-frequency trading firms, and hurt prominent market makers like Genesis, which is owned by CoinDesk's parent company, Digital Currency Group.  ""It's likely all the major market makers were affected, to varying degrees, by the collapse of FTX. As a result, several liquidity providers have likely scaled back or even ceased their market-making activities as part of an overall effort to de-risk,"" Dick Lo, founder and CEO of TDX Strategies, said.  ""There's also been a migration of positions to decentralized exchanges to minimize counterparty risk, hence the growth in volumes at popular decentralized trading venues such as GMX,"" Lo added.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/28/continued-thinning-of-liquidity-in-bitcoin-and-ether-market-worries-traders,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/517f6241ed9e4d8a374e77ad5b69cd796bf2d5ea-6000x3375.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414300,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB46dw,1677575080,"Arbitrum-Based FactorDAO Releases Staking Service, Developers Address Crypto Twitter Rumors","Arbitrum-based asset management protocol FactorDAO released its much-awaited staking service on Monday, days after ending a token sale on the decentralized exchange Camelot.  Last week, some on Crypto Twitter alleged that part of Factor's code was ""copied"" from other crypto projects.  “This project called FactorDAO $FCTR launching on CamelotDEX Is a blatant copy of SpoolFi,” popular Crypto Twitter trader Romano tweeted. “Imitation is flattery.”  Factor has since hit back on those claims. The protocol's pseudonymous founder Kurapika further told CoinDesk in a Telegram message that the allegations were started by an anonymous Crypto Twitter user referring to minor documentation mistakes accidentally left in Factor's technical documents.  ""The source quoted is an anon user, referring to five bullet points we mistakenly left in one of our docs during editing, as we liked the abstraction,"" Kurapika told CoinDesk. ""While our code is brand-new, we're not even sure what ""copied code"" means in an open-source environment.""  ""We have been working for the past nine months on a novel ERC4626 architecture, which many [decentralized finance] builders have yet to adopt. It's been audited, and [version 1] is already in beta ahead of mainnet launch next week,"" Kurapika added. ERC-4626 is a standard to optimize and unify the technical parameters of yield-bearing vaults for products such as Factor.  Despite the tremors, Factor has focused on releasing its staking and vaults services for users in the past week.  Staking refers to locking up one’s tokens to participate and help maintain the security of that network's blockchain in turn for rewards.  Factor will take a percentage of the deposit, withdrawal, transaction, vault management, and performance fees and redistributes 50% to FCTR stakers, and 50% to its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).  FCTR stakers will, therefore, earn yields on staking their tokens as liquidity to the platform while the platform will use the increased liquidity to offer even more products to potential users.  Users who lock tokens for up to four years will receive the highest yields, the highest percentage of governance rights, and a higher amount of vested factor (veFCTR) – a token issued to users who lock their FCTR on the staking platform.  FCTR sees volatile trading  Last week, Factor’s FCTR token launch on Camelot prompted several Arbitrum users to criticize the initial high market capitalization and overall issuance mechanism.  Factor ended up raising $7.5 million from 4,000 unique wallets. However, every participant got FCTR tokens at the same final price of 75 cents apiece due to the issuance mechanism on Camelot.  Even though the raise initially fixed a 10 cents price floor for each FCTR token, the final pool of money raised was equally distributed with the total number of issued tokens to determine the initial price of FCTR in the open market.  But these tokens were almost immediately dumped on the open market on Sunday, falling to as low as 44 cents, DEXTools data shows.  Buying pressure after the initial dump saw tokens regain the pre-sale price of 75 cents on Monday morning, but have since seen a gradual sell-off to just over 58 cents at writing time on Tuesday.

Finoa, which has been operating under a preliminary crypto custody license since January 2020, also closed a strategic venture round led by new investor Middlegame Ventures and including existing investors Balderton Capital, Coparion, Venture Stars, and Signature Ventures. The size of the investment was not disclosed.  Given the general state of regulatory uncertainty across crypto markets, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently announcing plans to focus specifically on crypto custodians, the seal of approval from BaFin couldn’t come at a better time, said Finoa co-founder Chris May.  “The custody license in particular is a very reassuring message to our customers and differentiates us from many other players in the market,” said May in an interview. “The preliminary regulatory status we have been under since the beginning of 2020 follows the same checkpoints and standards which the SEC followed through on a couple of weeks ago.”  In addition to the custody approval, Finoa received the go-ahead for broker dealer and prop trading licenses, which allows the firm to trade with its own treasury but not against its customers, May pointed out.  Finoa raised a $22 million Series A round back in 2021. Regarding the undisclosed level of this new funding, May said it wasn't a major Series B round.  “As part of the license approvals we wanted to strengthen our statutory or regulatory capital,” he said. “Adding some millions to our balance sheet portrays trust to our customers and allows us to leverage the licenses to the fullest.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/02/28/crypto-custodian-finoa-gets-license-approvals-from-german-regulator-bafin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d399ebfa3e04cb916dadd48c7e0d70171824e232-3500x2333.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The cause of this is still unknown and under active investigation.”  “Root cause is still unknown and under active investigation,” developers added.  The problems that started as sluggish transaction processing spiraled into a near complete shutdown of activity on Solana, validators and developers told CoinDesk over the weekend.  Users were unable to move any tokens or conduct any transactions during the outage period until a restart by the network’s validators, at which point transactions resumed, albeit very slowly.  Market reaction to the halt remained relatively timid. Solana’s native tokens (SOL) fell from $23.50 to just over $21 on Saturday night before erasing all losses from Sunday to Monday.  Meanwhile, Solana Labs co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko dismissed theories of increased network voting as a major cause behind the network outage in tweets on Monday evening.  “Votes aren't just counted as transactions, they are literally implemented as transactions because there is no cheaper way to do it,” Yakovenko said. “If there was a cheaper way to get votes to all the nodes in the network, then why wouldn't user transactions also take the cheaper path?”  Read more: Solana Validators to Make Second Restart Attempt as Transaction Freeze Drags On",NEGATIVE,SOL,SOL,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/28/solana-developers-say-reason-for-network-outage-still-unclear,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9330e446966503fdb5a2a005d656af4984e9ac53-5184x3888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414304,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB46zA,1677558945,Second Ethereum Testnet Successfully Simulates Shanghai Hard Fork,"A second Ethereum test network (testnet), known as Sepolia, successfully replicated withdrawals of staked ether (ETH) Monday, bringing the Ethereum blockchain closer to its highly anticipated Shanghai Upgrade.  The upgrade was triggered at epoch 56832 at 4:04 UTC and finalized at 4:17 UTC (11:17 p.m. ET).  The Shanghai Upgrade will mark Ethereum’s complete transition to a fully functional proof-of-stake network, enabling validators to withdraw rewards earned from adding or approving blocks to the blockchain.  There is one more test, on Ethereum’s Goerli testnet, that is planned before Shanghai goes live.  The test on Sepolia was designed to provide developers with another dress rehearsal of the withdrawals similar to those that will happen on the main Ethereum blockchain. Testnets copy a main blockchain, in this case Ethereum, and allow developers to test any changes to their applications in a low-stakes environment.  Sepolia is the second of three testnets to run through such a simulation. But unlike the previous testnet upgrade that happened earlier this month on Zhejiang, this was on a closed testnet, meaning that only the Ethereum core developers run the validators on this testnet. Sepolia is also the smallest of all three testnets in terms of the number of validators participating on it, making it the least important of all three.  Read more: Ethereum Testnet Processes First ETH Staking Withdrawals  The final testnet upgrade will occur to Goerli sometime in the coming weeks. That would be the final dress rehearsal before the main blockchain is able to process staked ETH withdrawals. Goerli’s testing will also be the most anticipated given that it is the biggest testnet of the three and it mimics the main Ethereum blockchain’s activity most closely.  If the developers continue to run test upgrades three weeks apart, the next testnet upgrade on Goerli would likely occur around March 21, which could likely push the mainnet Shanghai Upgrade into April. If that were the case, there would be a slight delay versus the target of March that Ethereum developers had initially signaled for the release of staked ETH.

42414316,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB47qE,1677548592,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Stays Rooted Near $23.5K,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin stays rooted near the $23.5K threshold. Ether and many other major cryptos trade flat.  Insights: China-based developers can interact with layer 1 blockchain Conflux, but the protocol's relationship with the country remains complicated.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,091 −3.3 ▼ 0.3% Bitcoin (BTC) $23,418 −88.7 ▼ 0.4% Ethereum (ETH) $1,631 −7.5 ▼ 0.5% S&P 500  3,982.24 +12.2 ▲ 0.3% Gold  $1,824 +7.0 ▲ 0.4% Nikkei 225  27,423.96 −29.5 ▼ 0.1% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Bitcoin Holds Firm Near $23.5K  Bitcoin continued its weekend encampment near $23,500 into Monday as investors spent yet another day weighing fiendishly stubborn inflation and the prospects of the U.S. Federal Reserve hiking interest rates more hawkishly than was previously expected.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $23,481, roughly flat over the past 24 hours, but down from its highs a week ago over $25,000 – before surprisingly strong jobs and price data had markets increasingly contemplating the prospect of a 50 basis point rate increase instead of 25 bps.  “Markets of late have been pricing in rates that will remain higher for longer than previously anticipated because of inflation numbers that seem to be rather stubborn,"" Brent Xu, CEO and co-founder of Web 3 bond-market platform Umee, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. ""A possible 50-basis-point hike could be in the offing now, too.""  Yet Xu also noted hopefully that crypto markets have not seen ""a massive drawdown ... that the more alarmist crypto Twitter commentators have been warning about.""  ""I suspect that we haven’t seen a massive pullback because the forced sellers have already sold,"" he wrote, adding: ""Last year’s daisy chain of blowups appears to have mostly come to an end. This isn’t to say that we can’t go lower from here. But a bottom for this cycle is probably in now, and in turn we are probably in an accumulation phase. I think we need to be prepared for sideways action for some time.”  Ether was almost equally flat, changing hands at about $1,630. Most other major cryptocurrencies were flat or edged down slightly with layer 2 platform Polygon's MATIC token and decentralized finance protocol Aave's AAVE token both recently down about 3%. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets overall performance ticked down about 0.36%.  After a week to forget, equity markets returned to their winning ways, however slightly. The tech-focused Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) all ticked up a few fractions of a percentage point. Treasury yields dipped slightly but remained fretfully high at above $3.90 on a 10-year note.  To be sure, some crypto news Monday was ominous for markets, none more than a report by crypto asset manager CoinShares that short-bitcoin funds had $10 million in inflows during the week ended Feb. 24 and that long-bitcoin funds bled $12 million, the third straight weekly outflow. Later in the day, crypto exchange Coinbase tweeted that it would suspend trading of Binance USD (BUSD) starting March 13 because the stablecoin doesn’t meet its listing standards – the latest body blow to the stablecoin sector.  Yet, at least one other analyst was feeling at least partly upbeat about crypto prices' path forward. In an interview with CoinDesk TV, Bruno Ramos de Sousa, head of new markets at crypto asset manager Hashdex, said that markets were ""in the recovery phase already ... past the bottom."" Ramos de Sousa noted increased interest among institutional investors in recent months.  ""They're educated in the sector, and they're looking for interesting windows to come in,"" he said. ""These are hedge funds, family offices, people concerned with bottoms and ups.""

It sees the former as a key technology, as important in the 21st century as the hypertext transport protocol (HTTP) was in the 20th; the latter is a speculative asset that inhibits the worst parts of capitalism.  Meanwhile, ""China"" tokens are surging. ""China"" is in quotes because most of these projects like NEO, VeChain (VET), and Conflux (CFX) go to great lengths to limit their exposure to China. They have development teams in China, but the company is registered offshore.  You can use the technology within the country, just not trade the token. A version of NEO is available on China’s Blockchain Service Network, for instance, but this exists as a seperate universe from the NEO the rest of the world sees in order to comply with local law.  In many cases, these tokens are divorced from the project. You can’t see China data on-chain, and it might be questionable as to what is driving the token’s growth.  Conflux’s CFX token is the exception to this.  Can you trade Conflux’s CFX token in China? No.  Can someone within China interact with the Western-facing portion of the Conflux chain? Also no, these parts are segregated.  But at the same time, CFX is the tie that binds the two together.  ""There is only one chain, but we have two spaces,"" Fan Long, Conflux’s co-founder, told CoinDesk by email. ""You can think of the spaces acting like independent chains but they share the same consensus engine. There is no security risk of moving assets across two spaces.""  Within China, CFX relies on Conflux’s sponsorship mechanism, which allows ordinary users to interact with smart contracts without holding crypto. Stuff still exists on-chain minus the gas fees.  Developers of decentralized applications, such as China’s version of Instagram called “Little Red Book,” buy CFX from Conflux directly. They pay in fiat and get an official receipt. In many ways, it would be similar to paying for a cloud service hosting bill.  “Because the public chain must have a native token governing its resources for gas, and China does not encourage anything related to fungible tokens, we choose to have foreign entities to govern the token issuance of CFX,” Long said.  One can see on-chain how CFX is used. Below shows the on-chain activity for a digital collectible, China’s version of a non-fungible token (which it calls “digital collectibles,” and tolerates if speculation is not involved) on its version of Instagram.  In many ways, CFX could be thought of as a proxy of success for Conflux within China. But is there enough interest to drive and sustain triple-digit growth on the CFX token?

Blockchain transaction data by Arkham shows that Voyager transferred at least some $54 million of cryptocurrencies to exchanges Coinbase and Binance.US in the past week, likely to sell the tokens. It transferred at least $24.7 million of ether (ETH), $12.2 million of shiba inu (SHIB) and $2.5 million of Chainlink’s LINK to exchanges through the last seven days, per Arkham's data.  The crypto broker’s total deposits to exchanges amount to $121 million since the beginning of February.  Transaction data also shows that Voyager received some $150 million of Circle’s USDC stablecoin from Coinbase in the past four days, likely proceeds from the cryptocurrency sales.  Voyager halted all trading and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July. As part of the court proceedings, it agreed to sell itself to Binance.US after an auction. Federal and state regulators' concerns have mounted around the deal, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) probing Voyager’s VGX token as unregistered securities offering.  The crypto broker’s recent maneuver may also foreshadow selling pressure for the cryptocurrencies that are among the firm’s largest holdings, notably for ETH and SHIB.
