42398964,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhn3J,1459542277,Overstock Invests $4 Million in Barbados Bitcoin Startup,"Caribbean digital currency exchange Bitt has received $4m in new funding from online retailer Overstock.com.  The deal, announced today, comes after Bitt's February launch of a blockchain-backed digital version of the Barbados dollar. The startup raised $1.5m in seed funding last March from local VC firm Avatar Capital.  Bitt CEO Gabriel Abed told CoinDesk that the deal originated at the Satoshi Roundtable, an invite-only industry gathering held in late February.  The funds will be used to expand the company’s team beyond Barbados.  Abed explained:  ""We’ll be taking what we’ve done in Barbados and cookie-cutting across the region, badgering legislators and helping with policy reform as it relates to security, consumer protection, privacy and data, and more importantly, no hindrance of the innovation of blockchain technology, and specifically bitcoin.""  Abed said that the startup will look to use some of the funds to satisfy its regulatory requirements.  Declining to comment on whether his startup would play a role in Overstock work using blockchain tech, Abed remarked that the two companies share an active, collaborative relationship.  “Let’s just say the two companies are acting as one big family, and we’re being treated as such,” he said.  Overstock itself is continuing development of its blockchain-powered securities exchange, tØ. The online retailer recently disclosed that it intended to conduct a securities offering of its own stock on the platform, expected to feature the sale of 1 million blockchain-based securities. Overstock’s securities platform was unveiled last August.  In a statement, CEO Patrick Byrne suggested that Overstock’s investment was driven in part by the startup’s work on digital currency-based payments, with an eye to unbanked populations in the region.  ""We respect and endorse that vision, and share a common desire to see online consensual exchange flourish globally,"" said Byrne. ""As they say around these parts, ‘One love’.""

42398969,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhn8E,1459540920,Bitcoin Price Finds Status Quo in $415 Range,"Markets Weekly is a weekly column analyzing price movements in the global digital currency markets, and the technology's use case as an asset class.  The price of bitcoin experienced relative price stability and consistent volume during the seven days through 1st April, maintaining its recent status quo as market participants await resolutions to lingering uncertainties.  The digital currency's price has seen modest volatility since the start of March, but some experts have warned that this situation could soon change. While some cited technical indicators in predicting that bitcoin may become more volatile, one expert asserted the current situation is merely the ""calm before the storm"".  Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of BitMEX, shed some light on how geopolitical developments could potentially increase demand for alternative means of savings, which he suggested could mean digital currencies.  ""I think the negative interest rate theme is becoming more and more relevant to people around the world,"" he stated, adding:  ""Greek banks are now charging to change large into small denomination bills. This is only going to accelerate the trend of people to search out alternative means of savings.""  Tempering this opinion, however, is that macro-economic volatilities seem to have less impact on the bitcoin trading ecosystem of late.  For example, the ongoing drama over whether the UK will leave the European Union, dubbed the 'Brexit', does not seem to have captured the interest of traders, at least not at the levels of last year’s ‘Grexit’, which helped to push the digital currency's value to yearly highs.  Modest fluctuations  Larger developments aside, bitcoin's price fluctuated largely within a modest range between $410 and $425 during the week ending 12:00 UTC on 1st April, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  It reached a high of $426.85 at 18:00 UTC on 27th March and a low of $410.50 at 13:00 UTC on 30th March.  Week-over-week, bitcoin’s price was largely unchanged, starting at $412.89 at 12:00 UTC on 25th March and finishing at $415.51 at 12:00 UTC on 1st April.  Market participants traded more than 32m BTC during the period, and more than 97% of this volume took place between OKCoin and Huobi, Bitcoinity data shows. Market participants traded 17m BTC, or 51.38% of total weekly volume, through the former exchange, while another 15.2m BTC, or 45.93%, was transacted through the latter.  These patterns of robust trading volume and modest price fluctuations followed the trend set during the prior two weeks.  In the seven days through 25th March, the digital currency fluctuated between $405 and $420, but experienced only a modest week-over-week change, additional BPI figures reveal. In addition, market participants traded 32.6m BTC.  This modest price movement contrasted with the gain experienced by ether, which rose from 0.026BTC at 12:00 UTC on 25th March to 0.028BTC on 1st April, according to Etherscan.io.  As a result, ether enjoyed a week-over-week increase of close to 8%, a sign interest in Ethereum and confidence remains high in the platform following the launch of its production version.  Possible breakout  Bitcoin has lingered mostly between $410 and $425 since early March, but one expert told CoinDesk that this trend is long overdue for a change.  ""The price has spent way too long in this range, and its going to make a big move soon,"" argued George Samman, a blockchain advisor and consultant. ""Looking at the technicals a major volatility squeeze is coming. So far the price has held above key support which is basically right here between $400-$415.""  ""If it breaks through support its going to break hard,” he added. “I think very soon we will know in which direction it wants to go.""  Should bitcoin experience the sharp price movement Samman suspects may take place, this development could help spur greater interest in speculative trading, a form of activity one market expert believes has fallen to the wayside as of late.  This lack of interest is evidenced by bitcoin’s ""narrow trading range and low levels of liquidity,"" Joe Lee, founder of bitcoin derivatives trading platform Magnr, told CoinDesk. However, he emphasized that this may all be temporary, and that market conditions could rapidly change.  He emphasized the silver lining of the modest volatility bitcoin has been experiencing, adding:  ""A stable price shows continual belief that the outcome of the block size debate and network congestion will not affect bitcoin’s longer term value.""

42398972,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhnBB,1459536847,How Kialara Uses Physical Bitcoins to Explore the Value of Art,"Given the electronic nature of digital currencies, physical bitcoins may seem to be a paradox – yet the market remains a thriving niche for collectors and enthusiasts.  Indeed, the purpose of owning physical bitcoins varies. While some use the coins to create a dialogue about cryptocurrency, others want to be able to hold and collect what they see as an actual piece of the technology's history.  But not all physical bitcoins are created equal, and none may be more prized among collectors than the creations of Kialara, a project that has set itself apart for intricate designs that may look more at home in an art gallery than on a computer desk.  Several entities, including the now-defunct Casascius coins, have been involved in the production of physical bitcoins over the years, but Kialara differs from other physical bitcoins in that the more common circular design is encased within a bar, bringing to mind the idea of a collector’s case around a physical coin representation.  As a sign of its success, Kialara boasts high-profile fans including investor and Bloq co-founder Matthew Roszak, who noted that he sees physical bitcoins, in particular Kialara, as necessary conversation starters.  Roszak told CoinDesk:  ""In trying to describe bitcoin to people, having some sort of physical representation really helps. People are very visual, and having such a beautiful piece of art to accompany the discussion about bitcoin adds a lot of value.""  Roszak believes that the best way to educate someone about bitcoin is to give them something to actually experience, and this idea has inspired him to give out Maxfield Mellenbruch’s work as a gift.  He has even presented the Kialara to a number of people within the tech world, including Virgin mogul and blockchain industry supporter Richard Branson.  Since the original Kialara, Mellenbruch has created several different variations to that first design, from the 2015 Kialara Labyrinth, which contains a maze of ball bearings, to the most recent series, the Kialara Signature Series.  The Signature Series features the bitcoin-inspired artwork of Ricky Allman and Julia Tourianski, seamlessly combining two-dimensional mediums with the sophisticated beauty of the physical Kialara. Each Kialara goes for $179.  Mellenbruch recently auctioned off Allman’s original painting, ‘Excavatorelevator 1’. The auction ended on 28th March, with the winning bid was $1,255.  Tourianski’s ‘Current’ will follow on 1st April. The winner of the auction will also receive the Kialara version in wallet form — Serial 01/500.  Creating a conversation  Mellenbruch's first 100 Kialaras quickly sold out, and word spread quickly as bitcoin enthusiasts were eager to own a piece of what many considered to be cryptocurrency history.  ""I haven’t had to market them at all,"" Mellenbruch said. For now, he is as busy as he wants to be.  But in addition to being a coveted collector's item within the bitcoin space, the Kialara also raises questions about both the necessity of trust and the value of artwork.  Notably, Kialaras are sold unfunded, and it is the buyer’s decision whether or not to add bitcoins to the bar.  Funding a Kialara is similar to funding a paper wallet, with owners using the public key to transfer funds onto the bar. At this time, the only way to open a Kialara and use the balance is to completely destroy the work of art, thus discouraging anyone from actually doing so.  As it turns out, many collectors are choosing to leave their Kialaras unfunded, purchasing them strictly for the beauty of their engineering and design.  One Redditor purchased the Kialara with the initial idea of using it as a secure way to store his bitcoins. Yet, upon seeing the bar in person, he chose instead to leave it unfunded.  ""The funny thing is that his crafting of these pieces is so fantastic that their splendor has overshadowed their utility. I dare say most people collecting them are, like me, doing so for their beauty and artistry and not in order to use them to store any bitcoin at all,"" he said.  He considers himself to be a collector, owning eight designs in total, and sees himself buying ""at least one of every series"" in the future.  Another Redditor recounted a similar experience:  ""My original intent at purchase was to actually load it and keep it in my safe deposit box. That quickly changed when it arrived in the mail. These bars are pieces of art, and they deserve to be displayed as such.""  “You can tell the piece requires a lot of planning and engineering,” a third customer said.  Question of worth  For Mellenbruch, the future of the funded Kialaras is of greater interest to him due to the questions that the work raises concerning the valuation of art.  ""When there’s an auction of something like a Monet painting, a lot of people don’t really understand how value is assigned to that art piece. With the funded Kialaras, I am seeing how art can appreciate beyond its aesthetic value or beyond its collectible value,"" he said.  When a user funds a Kialara, part of the value is built directly into the artwork, and no one is able to argue that particular aspect of the overall value composition. Whether the aesthetic value increases over time, the value of the piece would grow simply due to any rise in the bitcoin rate.  Trust is an essential component to the design of the Kialara, and in fact, it is a necessary one for the product to serve its purpose as a bitcoin storage device. For most of his designs, Mellenbruch personally created the private and public keys associated with the bar, requiring his customers to place trust in both the security of his creation process and his integrity.  While some customers have asked about the possibility of adding two-factor authentication to the bars, Mellenbruch has declined their requests, due to concerns about the secondary market for the collectibles.  Mellenbruch explained:  ""If someone wants to buy a funded Kialara on the secondary market, they can comfortably know that the only person to have handled the keys is me – not the seller.""  If others were able to handle the private keys, a customer interested in purchasing a Kialara on the secondary market would have to trust that those with knowledge of those keys won't try to steal the bitcoins inside.  Yet not everyone desires two-factor authentication when it comes to the Kialara bars. According to the feedback that he has received, most of Mellenbruch’s customers actually see the trust in him as one of the main features of the overall design.  “It goes against the decentralized nature of bitcoin, but it’s a concept that I wanted to float out there,” he said.  Role of trust  The trust element is a dynamic component of the piece that changes with each fluctuation in the value of bitcoin. If someone chooses to fund their Kialara, their trust in Mellenbruch must become greater as the price of bitcoin rises.  Should someone choose to sell their funded Kialara on the secondary market, they are also transferring their trust in Mellenbruch to the new owner.  Mellenbruch wants the brand to evolve, and with this evolution, he envisions changes to the element of trust that some customers place in him.  ""I admittedly don’t love all of the responsibility that comes with the creation and disposal of the keys, from the safety deposit box to the need for offline computers,"" he said.  However, Mellenbruch maintains that trust was necessary to realize his concept in his earlier pieces, adding:  ""I think of the public and private keys as being a medium in the Kialara, along with steel, aluminum, and glass.""  In store for the future  As interest in the Kialara continues, Mellenbruch is using a portion of his proceeds to commission Haven beehives. Haven is a network of functional beehive sculptures designed solely for the wellbeing and benefit of the bees, not for the harvesting of their products.  So far, two of the 16-foot sculptures he’s commissioned have been completed, and they are scheduled to be installed this summer.  Going forward, Mellenbruch says he is interested in more collaborations, as well as getting some help with assembly.  He commented:  ""Some customers were requesting IKEA-style designs that they can assemble themselves. That’s like a dream to me now.""  Mellenbruch plans to launch an official Kialara website in the coming weeks.

42398959,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhmyO,1459530187,SEC Chair: Agency 'Actively Exploring' Blockchain Regulation,"The chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last night spoke out publicly on the Federal regulatory agency's current and future plans for potential blockchain controls.  Amid a recap of the SEC’s past and future dealings with the blockchain, Chairwoman Mary Jo White specifically called out companies or individuals that seek to use new technology like blockchain to facilitate the transfer of securities.  White said in her published remarks:  “One key regulatory issue is whether blockchain applications require registration under existing Commission regulatory regimes, such as those for transfer agents or clearing agencies. We are actively exploring these issues and their implications.”  This was the first public word out of the SEC on the potential future of blockchains since December. On 16th December of last year the SEC approved Overstock.com’s plans for its subsidiary TØ to issue securities on bitcoin’s blockchain.  Days later, on 22nd December, SEC secretary Brent Fields published its advanced notice of proposed regulations on transfer agents and asked for public comment on the use of blockchain technology within federal securities regulations. According to the transcript from last night's speech, those comments will be evaluated to help in the regulatory process.  Blockchain's bigger picture  White’s remarks on the blockchain came at the end of a speech focused on the topic of protecting investors in a rapidly changing financial marketplace.  She addressed potential concerns related to the new ways in which startups can approach raising capital prior to going public, as well as new legislative provisions that, in part, were designed to let companies award equity as part of crowdfunding initiatives.  Included in her comments on the potential impact of blockchain on the securities industry, White also addressed other “challenges of FinTech”, including robo-advisors — or machine-powered investment advisors — and marketplace lending, the practice of using software to directly connect borrowers with non-bank lenders.  The event at which White spoke, “The Silicon Valley Initiative: Protecting Investments in Pre-IPO Issuers,” was hosted by Stanford’s Rock Center for Corporate Governance, and the SEC’s San Francisco Regional Office in an attempt to engage in a dialog with Silicon Valley academics, entrepreneurs, executives, and others.  In her speech, White remarked that new financial technologies ""have the potential to transform how our markets operate in virtually every respect"", going on to argue:  ""These innovations compel us to think carefully about how best to protect investors so they – and we – can have confidence in this growing and changing landscape.""

42398966,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhn4I,1459527265,CoinDesk’s Hard Fork 'Text Size' Debacle Temporarily Averted,"A temporary solution to the ongoing text size debate has been reached, CoinDesk has learned, ending the contentious hard fork that risked leaving readers viewing news articles with incompatible text sizes.  The debate, fueled by text size problems experienced by news blockchain users earlier today, sparked the launch of competing implementations of the news blockchain, most notably CoinDesk Turbo, led by journalist Stan Higgins, and CoinDesk Smooth, a proposal put forth by CoinDesk editor Pete Rizzo.  The team behind Turbo had sought to increase the text size whereas Smooth was positioned as a means to increase the size of CoinDesk’s pages, thereby making the text larger.  Now, CoinDesk has moved to organize an event six months from now at which various stakeholders in the news blockchain will discuss proposals for increasing scalability. Early ideas include allowing for dynamic text sizes or the creation of an off-chain network to facilitate information flows in what has been unofficially dubbed the Stringing Network.  Leaders on both sides of the debate quickly weighed in telling CoinDesk that the plan to discuss future options at a meeting, set to take place in Ordos, China this summer.  “I believe this solution will create opportunities to address concerns of both the small texters and the large texters,” CoinDesk Smooth chief scientist Pete Rizzo said in an emailed statement. “Despite a contentious debate involving members of the CoinDesk Turbo team, this solution represents the kind of consensus needed to expand mass adoption of our news blockchain.”  In interview, CoinDesk Turbo chief scientist Stan Higgins argued that the solution was not a permanent one, and merely amounted to kicking the can down the road on the text size issue.  He told CoinDesk:  “Our readers won’t wait for a text size solution, especially one from certain nameless VC-captured interests who seek to artificially limit the text size in order to push their agenda. More debate is good, but right now the news blockchain is at risk of losing out to more competitive networks. We’re not done. CoinDesk Turbo will succeed.”  CoinDesk reporter Michael del Castillo could not be reached at press time.  At press time, text size issues had reportedly been resolved as users began, at least temporarily, migrating back to the majority CoinDesk Smooth software.  CoinDesk will continue monitoring this developing story.

42398961,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhn1L,1459521833,Industry Speaks Out As CoinDesk's Text Size Turmoil Continues,"Following an unexpected hard fork of the CoinDesk news blockchain today, the much-lauded industry news site continues to experience website issues, users report.  At press time, CoinDesk readers were experiencing varying text sizes on the pages of articles as a result of being directed to one of at least two separate histories of the CoinDesk news blockchain.  Since the issues began, a number of competing development efforts have emerged in an attempt to address the situation at CoinDesk, with new technological solutions including CoinDesk Supreme, CoinDesk Wild Cherry, CoinDesk with Lime, CoinDesk Medium Rare and Dr CoinDesk.  At press time, CoinDesk Turbo and CoinDesk Smooth had emerged as the efforts with perhaps the most traction, according to independent analytics provided to CoinDesk.  CoinDesk Smooth, the oldest of the two efforts, representing an increasingly dwindling number of the open-source community’s developers over controversy that CoinDesk Editor and CoinDesk Smooth chief scientist Pete Rizzo had been effectively hiding a massive fortune in rizzocoins, the native token on the CoinDesk newschain.  Likewise, long-time CoinDesk contributor Stan Higgins had emerged as the leader of separate faction, CoinDesk Turbo, which is in the midst of attempting to convince CoinDesk readers to upgrade their software to increase the size of text on the website.  At press time, some were tweeting their support for their preferred software implementation, while others sought to position it as a plot to undermine the news agency.    .@coindesk for the record, I add my name to the list of signatories supporting CoinDesk Smooth        — Wong Joon Ian (@joonian) April 1, 2016        @newsbtc claims responsibility for CoinDesk hard fork, says plot ‘years in making’ https://t.co/lLpsrNyulS      — CoinDesk (@coindesk) April 1, 2016          The ‘text size’ controversy had been ongoing for months following the decision of former CoinDesk contributor Daniel Cawrey to publicly leave the CoinDesk project, decrying that it had “failed” in its attempts to create a viable news platform for the technology.  ""Why has CoinDesk failed? It has failed because the community has failed,"" he said, adding:  ""Really it was just became one guy who kept trying to push this ICO over and over again.""  Cawrey’s post included heated words for the CoinDesk newschain’s lead developers, as well as readers, who he said had failed to notice the numerous advertisements embedded in the website for rizzocoin, as well as the news site’s favorable coverage of its price projections.  ""Bitcoin is great, but it ain’t got nothin’ on rizzocoin,"" read one opinion article, submitted by a writer identified as ‘Dan Palmer’. ""Just think if everyone owned rizzocoin and used it for everything, it would have a market cap of like, a trillion dollars. Maybe more trillions.""  At press time, the price of rizzocoin was in rapid decline across exchanges, with the price plummeting out of the top-10, falling below dogecoin, vertcoin and paycoin.  Consensus averted  Still, some may be surprised at the sudden break in consensus as it follows a meeting in Hong Kong at which readers of CoinDesk and its newschain developers discussed the issue in backroom meetings.  As CoinDesk’s newschain is primarily mined by Asia-based entities, a language gap strained dialogue. Further, only two of the representatives at the meeting spoke both Mandarin and English.  ""Can’t we all get along,"" Rizzo had said at the meeting. “Just remember, we are not in it for the money, we’re here to change the world!”  The meeting ended abruptly when members of the mining community began attempts to physically accost Rizzo, though he maintains his statements were not correctly translated, and that certain sophistications of CoinDesk Smooth were not properly articulated.  Further controversy surrounded the ill-fated meeting after members of the CoinDesk Turbo development team took to social media to complain that they had not been invited.  “It’s ridiculous,” CoinDesk Turbo chief scientist Stan Higgins told CoinDesk in an email. “How are we supposed to math away the problems of the world if we can’t get together in one room?”  Not ready for primetime  Detractors in the industry sought to suggest that the hard fork was a sign that CoinDesk is not yet ready to compete against financial news websites like Bloomberg and Reuters despite its recent acquisition by Digital Currency Group.  “This is exactly the situation we predicted when speaking out against larger text sizes. Newcomer devs have rushed to turn CoinDesk into some sort of world media network like Buzzfeed with its ability to process over 2,000 new articles per second. And the result is a mess,” Kaiko marketing director Jon Southurst said.  As such, R3 head researcher Tim Swanson, for instance, indicated that institutions would likely be unaffected by the issue:  ""How the great font size debate is resolved is an important issue irrespective of whether or not you are using a gated or ungated website. I suspect that financial institutions will only be interested in font sizes that conform to existing regulatory font specifications.""

From this time forward, readers have reported unexpected increases in the size of the CoinDesk’s text, to the point where certain articles experience wildly fluctuating text sizes.    @coindesk your website behaves weird, it scrolls by itself and resizes text…    Are you hacked?! pic.twitter.com/MtprYnJRTe        — Fabian Vogelsteller (@feindura) April 1, 2016        @coindesk website going crazy when reading article. Paragraphs randomly increasing n size. Feature or hack!      — #PL (@patricklismore) April 1, 2016          However, for many observers of the website, the split is not unexpected, as it follows a months-long debate in the once-lauded organization over how it could best modify its website to increase the size of its audience.  At issue, members of the organization said, was the size of the font on the website, which through a hard-coded rule in the CoinDesk news blockchain, was limited to a 12-point size. Opponents of the measure had long argued that the 12-point text size was too limiting for a readership that was increasingly aging due to an influx of financial incumbents.  CoinDesk Turbo chief scientist and journalist Stan Higgins said:  ""An over-60 readership demands a larger text. It is simply irresponsible for CoinDesk to continue to neglect making the necessary changes to ensure a wider demographic can read about an online web currency predominantly used by millennials and criminals.""  The argument ran counter to a roadmap put forth by CoinDesk Editor Pete Rizzo, who had argued for an aggressive move away from the 12-point font size could put the network at risk should a consensus on the text size not be reached.  Rather than a tweak to the font size, Rizzo had put forth a proposal called CoinDesk Smooth that would have decreased the size of CoinDesk’s pages, thereby making the text look bigger, even as it remained the same size.  The change was held up as a breakthrough in newschain science by some, yet derided as a hollow workaround by others.  “News blockchains remain a relatively underdeveloped field of study,” Rizzo had said earlier this month. “We simply do not know the full ramifications of this change. What we need now is to keep that news flow nice and smooth.”  Vested interest?  Still, some had questioned the validity of Rizzo’s statement given that, as one of its longest-serving editors, he had benefitted from a pre-mine of rizzocoin, the native token on the CoinDesk news blockchain.  At press time, Rizzo was reported to have more than 98% of the networks tokens, though he repeatedly declined requests for further comment.  ""We all know what this is about,"" Higgins said during a recent meeting to discuss changes to the CoinDesk newschain. ""Rizzo can’t get enough of that sweet, sweet coin.""  At launch, Rizzocoin was heralded as an innovative alternative cryptocurrency for its much-vaulted single coin, paired with a signature catch phrase: ""Out of One, Many"".  However, the project quickly sparked controversy upon the discovery of trillions of previously unknown tokens, the majority of which were held by Rizzo.  Tensions were further fueled when Rizzo unilaterally founded RizzoCorp, a startup devoted to both fostering development of rizzocoin as well as building enterprise solutions based on rizzocoin technology.  Representatives of RizzoCorp, however, maintain there was no connection between the well-funded company and the largely underpaid rizzocoin open-source development community.  Business in turmoil?  Following the website issues, eyewitness reports suggested the scene was ‘chaotic’.  CoinDesk director of strategy Jeremy Bonney was seen absconding from a second story window in what was described as a “desperate” attempt to flee the premises. His clothing, some said, appeared singed or had a “faint smell of burning”, though reporters were unable to confirm if this differed from his normal appearance and odor.  Calls and emails to CoinDesk’s offices in New York were not returned by press time. When reached for comment, CoinDesk lead developer Jonathan Bull could be heard laughing at steadily decreasing volumes before ending the phone call.  CoinDesk reporter, and the startup’s most recent hire, Michael del Castillo could not be reached.
