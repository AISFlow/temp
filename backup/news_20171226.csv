42428343,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7Gzh,1514322046,Editable Blockchains? Mining Futures? 2017 Saw Crypto Patents Pile Up,"The past 12 months have seen a range of patent applications focused on cryptocurrency or blockchain applications, including some from notable firms such as banking giant Bank of America and credit scoring giant FICO.  In sum, the flow of patent filings witnessed in the last year demonstrates that some of these major businesses are seriously weighing how the tech could change how they operate – or, at the very least, serve as a basis for new intellectual property.  Below, we look at some of the more notable (and proposed) uses of the technology from the past year, from the controversial rewriteable blockchain to a proposed system for exchanging cryptocurrencies from Bank of America.  BofA Exchange?  It was perhaps an unexpected patent award from one of the top banks in the U.S.  Released earlier this month and tracing back to 2014, Bank of America's proposed cryptocurrency exchange patent would, if fully realized, let users exchange a government-issued currency into a cryptocurrency. From there, as detailed by the filing, the user could then move into another crypto of their choosing.  The exchange would use three distinct accounts to act as temporary stores for each type of currency, with the first holding the user’s fiat, the second holding one type of cryptocurrency and the third holding the other one.  While it's clear that Bank of America is unlikely to be launching its own crypto-exchange anytime soon, the filing and subsequent award from this year nonetheless illustrate the kinds of applications being looked at within the financial sphere.  In a hypothetical future in which cryptocurrencies are used widely, the idea of walking down to your local bank branch to move from one digital money to another may not be so far-fetched.  The 'Editable Blockchain'  Accenture secured a patent this year for an editable blockchain, a concept celebrated by some and sharply critiqued by others.  The idea is that permissioned parties to a distributed ledger could, under certain conditions, alter the data that's been added in the event that it has been altered or is subject to fraud. Proponents say that it allows a critical degree of control that would, if called upon, be used to essentially keep the books clean from unfriendly parties and their transactions.  Yet critics deemed the idea controversial, stating that the concept flies in the face of bitcoin's essentially open-door policy, in which any party can download a load, broadcast transactions and add their data to the blockchain.  Ultimately, the editable blockchain patent perhaps illustrates the varying perspectives seen in the industry today – as well as the different ways in which the technology could be used and modified by participants in the space.  FICO watchdog  Is one of the biggest credit monitors getting into the bitcoin game?  That was one of the prevailing questions stoked by a patent application from FICO published in September. It outlined a method for detecting ""illegal"" cryptocurrency transactions, boasting a method for determining whether they are either fraudulent or part of a money laundering scheme.  The patent notably explained that the system would collect data from bitcoin exchanges, using that data to develop a “threat score” for each transaction. Transactions with higher threat scores would be flagged, allowing them to be reviewed before tracking them to their destination.  While it's not clear if FICO has begun tracking bitcoin exchange data, the filing showed that major financial firms outside of banks, brokerages and investment firms are exploring how the tech might impact them – and the kinds of functions they may serve in a possible future of wholly digital currencies and assets.  ATMchain?  One of the year's more notable filings came from China UnionPay, the payment card and ATM giant.  As illustrated by documents from the State Intellectual Property Office – the Chinese counterpart to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office – China UnionPay is looking at how it might connect its ATM networks via a blockchain.  At its heart, the proposed system would use blockchain as a kind of global clock, leveraging it to synchronize the ATMs and the mass amounts of data they process.  The company has not yet stated whether it is actively pursuing blockchain to connect its ATMs, but China UnionPay noted in its application that the security provided by the tech could solve a major problem its network faces.  Currency Trading  Is the ""father of financial future"" getting into crypto?  Such a potential was raised in a patent filing for a hardware device that enables cryptocurrency trading, given that one of its listed inventors – economist Richard Sandor – is credited as having pioneered the financial product in the 1970s. Sandor is a former Chicago Board of Trade chief economist and vice president.  The device described would tie digital currencies to derivatives contracts, ensuring security by placing the registry in a repository that is not publicly accessible. However, the registry would function as a mechanism for delivering the cryptocurrency.  Sandor's involvement was a notable aspect back when the filing was first made public. However, recent regulatory developments in the U.S. have perhaps brought the proposed invention back to the fore.  Less than two weeks ago, the CFTC released its proposed definition of what constitutes a ""physical delivery"" of a cryptocurrency. While that definition is still subject to public comment and possible alteration, the agency is moving closer to a formal policy after months of wrangling.  As a result, proposed inventions like this one (or something similar) could play a key role in helping exchanges provide ""physical"" delivery of something that is entirely digital.  Derivatives Mining        CME Group launched its first bitcoin futures contracts on Dec. 18 – and a filing from earlier this year suggests that it could create products aimed at specific parts of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.  Mining is an energy-intensive process by which new transactions are added to a blockchain, which also results in the minting of new coins as a reward. Put more simply, miners burn a lot of power to run their machines in a bid to – hopefully – add a block or two a day at the very least.  Yet the unpredictability of mining – variance and luck do have an impact – has attracted CME, which, as illustrated by its patent filing from April – outlined a way for miners to hedge some of their risks through derivatives.  Miners could hedge their bets by guaranteeing a payout if the network’s hash rate grows more quickly than expected (thus increasing the difficulty of finding a new block).  If the miners do make what is expected, or the hash rate grows more slowly than planned for, the contract would then expire. While the miners would not receive any money from it, they would be able to generate more profits through the mining process than originally planned.

42428340,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7Gnh,1514309450,A Central Bank Cryptocurrency? Not in 2018,"JP Koning is an avid blogger covering monetary economics and the history of money on his blog Moneyness.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      Central banks may be the 800-pound gorillas of the financial universe, but they have largely kept their hands off of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, preferring to monitor developments from a distance.  Will that change in 2018?  Some have speculated that 2018 will be the year that central banks start to add bitcoins to their balance sheets. I don't think so. Here's why: Your average bitcoin buyer has dramatically different goals from your average central banker.  Bitcoin buyers want to earn 10,000 percent returns and engage in near-anonymous transactions. Central bankers don't need high returns, nor do they require anonymity. They have an obligation to their citizens to ensure the stability of the currency. The steadiness of the assets that central banks hold in their portfolios is a key part of achieving this mandate.  If the purchasing power of money begins to fall too fast relative to its target, central bankers will try to undo this by buying back sufficient amounts of currency. This requires selling assets from their portfolio, or open market sales.  Assets that do not fluctuate much in value – say a government bond – can be counted on as steady material for open market sales. But bitcoin's price regularly fluctuates by 20-30 percent per week. Given this volatility, a central banker can’t expect to rely on bitcoin to provide oomph in future buyback efforts.  This means bitcoins won't help central bankers achieve their price stability mandate, and I wouldn't expect any of them to begin including bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in their portfolios.  Now, there may be a few central banks that add trace amounts of cryptocurrencies to their balance sheets – but only as a political stunt. For instance, I can imagine the Central Bank of Iran or the Central Bank of Russia publicly announcing that they'll reduce their U.S. dollar reserves by some small amount and substituting it with bitcoins.  But this would only be a way to land a public relations blow against an enemy, and not as a way to promote sound central banking.  Central bank digital currency  Many central bankers have been exploring the idea of issuing central bank digital currencies or digital accounts for use by regular folks. These tokens could be issued on a blockchain, held in a regular account, or exist on a smart card. Unlike bitcoin, this form of money would be fixed in value – i.e. one unit of digital currency would be pegged at $1 banknote.  I think it is unlikely that any central bank digital currencies or accounts will be introduced in 2018. There is a good chance that many central banks will even backpedal their efforts as they learn more about the challenges involved in introducing a digital payments product.  Here is the crux of the problem: It only makes sense for a central bank to issue digital currency or publicly-available accounts if there is sufficient demand. But it is not apparent where this demand will come from given that private bank accounts already provide the public with the same set of services that a central bank product would hypothetically offer.  For instance, one stated advantage of a central bank digital currency is that citizens would get the ability to hold risk-free digital money. But since bank deposits are themselves guaranteed by state-run insurance deposit schemes up to very high amounts, they are already 100 percent safe. So there is no apparent reason for anyone to switch.  Nor will central banks find it easy to compete with already-existing private sector payments alternatives.  Would the People's Bank of China (PBOC) do a better job running a retail payments network than Alibaba or Tencent? Would the Bank of Canada provide a superior payments product than Canada's commercial banks, say TD or CIBC, which bundle all sorts of other financial services along with their payments offering? Probably not.  So, it is not apparent to me why the public would want to use the central bank's product – and thus no reason for central bankers to spend much time on these projects.  A central bank digital currency could only gain public acceptance by providing a unique service that private alternatives do not offer: anonymity. We already know people use physical cash because – among other reasons – it enhances privacy. Likewise, anonymity would drive adoption of a digital version of cash. But, this would force central bankers out of their comfort zone and into what would be a contentious public debate over anonymity and financial censorship.  The upshot is that the only digital currency projects that stand a chance of surviving against the private competition must include anonymity, but only determined central bankers who understand the value of anonymity as a public service will be able to drive these anonymous digital currency projects forward in the face of criticism.  Unfortunately, there probably aren't too many central bankers out there willing to take that risk.  Regulation  Still, with central banks hesitant to buy cryptocurrencies or adopt CBDC, the one front on which they will be active in 2018 is regulation. As cryptocurrencies become ever more embedded into the conventional financial sector – say through futures, ETFs, hedge funds, or credit to buy bitcoin – the perceived risks of instability spreading from cryptocurrency markets into conventional markets increase.  Central bankers have stood by through most of the rise of cryptocurrencies. But since they have a watchdog role to play, I would expect them to increasingly view it as their responsibility to step in and regulate the sector.  It remains to be seen what form this regulation takes.  See 2018 differently? CoinDesk is now accepting submissions to its 2017 in Review. Email news@coindesk.com to make your voice heard.

42428334,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7Gjh,1514300133,The Death of the ICO (And 4 Other 2018 Predictions),"Stefan Thomas is chief technical officer at Ripple and co-creator of the Interledger payment protocol.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      If 2017 was the year of the ICO, 2018 will be the year of the great ICO hangover.  It will also be the year major financial institutions adopt digital assets, and mark the birth of hybrid blockchains.  1. The death of the ICO token  ""Cryptocurrency"" became a major buzzword in 2017. Suddenly, all eyes were on these new assets with speculators jumping into the market in droves and regulators heavily scrutinizing them.  In fact, in early December, the combined market capitalization of all digital currencies surpassed that of JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank. Initial coin offerings (ICOs) similarly exploded, raising hundreds of millions of dollars around the world in a matter of months.  While they made for exciting headlines, though, I expect the exuberance around ICOs to fizzle in 2018.  What's more, I also expect regulators and authorities worldwide to come down hard on fraudulent ICOs in the new year. That's because many ICOs skirted existing regulation in order to raise equity — with no solid business to back up the offering. Funds raised from some of these ventures have already started to disappear, and regulators, such as the SEC, recently announced that they’re getting ready to crack down on them.  I wouldn't be surprised to see hefty fines, litigation and even jail time for those standing on the wrong side of the ICO issue.  Beyond the regulatory crackdown, questions will arise around the utility of special-purpose tokens. Why would a file hosting company accept payment in Filecoin, when a general-purpose digital asset is so much more liquid and therefore easier to turn into fiat?  We don't use different currencies to buy clothes or pay our mortgage in the brick-and-mortar world and ICO token holders will realize the economics are no different online.  2. Financial institutions will adopt digital assets  If speculators entered the digital asset market in droves last year, 2018 will be the year that major institutional players like asset managers, pension funds and other financial institutions, such as payment providers, enter the space.  We’re already seeing increased over-the-counter (OTC) trading of digital assets, such as bitcoin on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), causing liquidity across the market to deepen. It’s really a matter of when, not if, listings of additional cryptocurrency futures on OTC exchanges will take place. My bet? We’ll see the listings by next summer.  Between this and new institutional players entering the market, I think digital assets have plenty of room for growth. However, the crypto space won’t be without its challenges. Forking, regulation, and banking — oh my!  Governance issues will continue to plague some digital assets — causing forks such as the one with bitcoin and bitcoin cash. This instability will be problematic for some who want to enter the market as it raises questions about supply as well as the level of risk involved.  The uncertain regulatory environment in the U.S., China and elsewhere could also stifle further development of the digital asset market. While countries like Japan and the Philippines have embraced digital assets in their economies and regulatory frameworks, there are many more worldwide without clear policies and laws for these assets.  They should take a page from the respective books of Japan and the Philippines in order to enable new services, increase financial inclusion, and lower barriers to economic growth.  For example, there are only a handful of financial institutions in the U.S. that will bank businesses in the cryptocurrency space. If they were to exit, or if regulation were to come through that prohibits exposure to the digital asset market, this could have very serious, adverse consequences on the improved services being developed. Banks need clear guidelines from regulators on how they can lawfully bank those associated with cryptocurrencies.  3. Blockchains will start to interoperate  In 2017, we've seen bitcoin's share of the cryptocurrency market drop from 87 percent to under 50 percent. Hundreds of new coins and tokens launched and are now being traded.  To make the broad use of digital assets truly mainstream, however, I think we’ll need the many blockchain networks that currently exist to interoperate. The truth is there will not be one single dominant blockchain network in the future — just as there isn’t any dominant internet or email provider globally today.  Currently, we can all email family, friends and colleagues from Gmail to Yahoo to Outlook seamlessly and instantly. Value should move across all ledgers in exactly the same way -— irrespective of the blockchain network, PayPal wallet or traditional bank account involved.  Indeed, we've already seen efforts in 2017 to address blockchain interoperability.  Raiden, the ethereum interoperability solution for ERC-20 tokens, launched its token in September, while the Interledger Protocol (ILP) was used to connect seven ledgers including bitcoin, ethereum and XRP in June. My money is (unsurprisingly) on Interledger.  If all networks were to become ILP-enabled, it ultimately wouldn't matter if you held bitcoin, ether, litecoin or XRP. ILP would allow you to make payments to a merchant that only accepts bitcoin, for example, using XRP — all in just a matter of seconds.  4. The birth of hybrid blockchains  Until now we’ve seen a proliferation of both public blockchains like bitcoin and private blockchains like Hyperledger Fabric. Going forward, I think we’ll start to see the rise of hybrid blockchains, which combine the best of both worlds.  A hybrid blockchain runs on the open internet and is accessible to anyone like a public blockchain, but it uses a smaller set of validators and is more targeted towards a specific use case like a private blockchain.  Deploying an ethereum contract or creating an ERC-20 token will be replaced by launching your own mini-blockchain, which can be tuned to the exact needs of a given project.  Need more decentralization? Less? More powerful functionality? Should it be upgraded frequently or remain very stable? One size doesn't fit all, but next year you'll finally be able to choose.  This will be part of a larger trend for blockchain networks to specialize. Current systems try to be everything to everybody. In the future, we'll see more targeted implementations designed for a clear use case. The best way to explain why this is necessary is to point to the Yahoo example — a tech giant that spread itself thin across too many products and services, and couldn’t be truly successful in any of them.  In the same way that Google focused on data, or Apple on design, I think those blockchains that focus on one core offering (e.g. a pure database like BigchainDB) will survive, and thrive.  5. Specialization or generalization — a contradiction?  Over the course of this article, I've argued that general-purpose tokens will replace special-purpose tokens and I've also said that special-purpose blockchains will replace general-purpose blockchains.  This might seem like a contradiction at first, but as blockchains become more interoperable, blockchains and tokens will simply be less coupled together. This transition will involve more growing pains, so it's sure to be an interesting year.  I’m excited to see how it all plays out.
