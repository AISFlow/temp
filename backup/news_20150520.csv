42378193,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MdaF,1432158355,Internet Security Pioneer Unveils Project at Blockchain University,"A project led by a pioneering developer of the Internet's secure sockets layer (SSL) protocol was among the standouts at Blockchain University's second demo day.  Held in Mountain View, California, on Monday, 18th May, the event featured presentations from roughly 10 projects created at the pre-accelerator during a six-week period beginning in April. Launched in December 2014, Blockchain University is aimed at promoting interest and innovation around blockchain technology and distributed ledgers.  Blockchain University's second demo night successfully showcased how nuanced projects can now be quickly built on a broad range of blockchains and developed with the aid of APIs from bitcoin industry businesses.  Among the early speakers and sponsors perhaps none illustrated the recent increase in focus on blockchain technology better than BitPay developer Eric Martindale, whose company was among the first to bet big on the widespread use of the bitcoin blockchain as a facilitator of payments.  Martindale told the audience:  ""One of the things that really struck me, is as I've grown, bitcoin is really the first app on the blockchain.""  BitPay senior software engineer Gregg Zigler and Monkey Inferno product manager Elyse Lefebvre went on to present Carrot, a project that enables a bitcoin wallet to accept an email address and replace it with a bitcoin address, all without needing any action from the user.  The project uses the bitcoin blockchain to move funds and the namecoin blockchain to guarantee that wallet names are unique.  ""What we wanted was an open protocol that minimizes trust in third parties and maximizes the use of the familiar,"" Zigler said.  Elsewhere, Collectible sought to use blockchains to both authenticate and create secondary markets for baseball trading cards, while Chainmail aimed to assist lawyers by making it easier to authenticate emails for later use in court cases.  While all these are examples of the types of projects created, none were among the most lauded by judges SKBI research fellow Tim Swanson and Coinalytics CEO Fabio Federici.  We review the top three projects as selected by event judges below:  Revoke SSL  The most polished project in the cohort, Revoke SSL succeeded by demonstrating its strong knowledge of a niche market (e-commerce checkout security) in need of a specific solution (the ability to signal quickly when HTTPS security has been compromised).  In particular, co-founder Matthew Schutte was able to illustrate how trust within this small but vital commerce system is in need of an overhaul.  For example, he explained how communications between browsers and websites can continue under the guise that a compromised certificate is valid, sometimes for weeks or months due to the difficulty of revoking certificates provided by third-party certificate authorities such as Trustwave and VeriSign.  The group also boasts unique experience tackling similar issues.  In addition to team members Jarod Holtz and Matthew Schutte, original SSL contributing developer Christopher Allen helped produce the product. Allen developed a reference implementation for SSL 3.0, the first successful version of the protocol and one on which newer updates have been based.  Though other presenters attacked small markets, Revoke SSL seemed the most serious about moving forward with the project following graduation, showcasing how it might evolve into a scalable and commercially viable business.  Potential clients contacted, they suggested, had expressed an interest in paying $150 for revocation services on a $500 certificates.  Squirrel  Squirrel aims to use blockchain technology and smart contracts to remove risk from global supply chains.  In a traditional supply chain, project leaders Jack Parkin and Sujata Meno argued, manufacturers take on unnecessary risk to ensure they are covered if vendors never fulfill orders. As a result, manufacturers struggle to gain the financing they need to produce new orders, thereby creating an expensive cycle of risk management.  To attack this issue, Squirrel developed a system by which parties could enter into a purchasing agreement at a lower risk level. Funds, the team proposed, could be sent to escrow accounts by both manufacturers and vendors. Squirrel, in turn, could act as a source of capital and security so that projects can be produced.  ""A contractor is building a tree house and getting wood from a vendor, and they need $100 to get the wood, but only have $50. Squirrel can do a credit check and agree to match,"" Parkin explained. ""Money stays in escrow for everyone to see.""  From there, Squirrel uses the Thingchain blockchain developed by startup Skuchain as a means of tracking supply codes.  As the products are shipped, supply codes would be intermittently validated, with funds being released to parties when the initial supplies and finished goods pass through predetermined checkpoints.  ""A small penetration of this market would be bringing quite a bit of returns,"" Parkin concluded.  Blocknotary  The issue of ownership and security was attacked again by the Blocknotary team, albeit in one of the more humorous presentations.  Created by Igor Barinov, David Bently, Roman Storm and Lilian Chan, Blocknotary allows those using cell phone cameras to attach a form of copyright to their creations. What separated the Blocknotary team, however, was how they had integrated this process in the traditional user experience.  Built as an iPhone app, Blocknotary allows users to access its service as they would email or Twitter when looking to share a photo. Alongside familiar options such as 'Assign to Contact', 'Print' and 'Use as Wallpaper' in an iPhone display, would be a Blocknotary button.  Someone taking a selfie, the team joked, would then put a description into a field, select 'Submit' and a copy of the photo would be made on the blockchain.  ""[The user is] going to submit this to the blockchain and what will be in the OP_RETURN is the embedded date and time,"" a presenter concluded.

The raid, reported by local source The Star, follows a number of searches and arrests across the Asia-Pacific region as part of a crackdown on UFUN led by Thailand's assistant police chief Suwira Songmetta.  The group's controversial business model focuses on UToken, a so-called bitcoin rival that UFUN claimed was backed by a ""gold reserve system"" alongside several multibillion-dollar companies. However, it remains unclear whether the UToken actually existed given the circumstances.  A similar organisation, MyCoin, made headlines in February following reports its founders had disappeared with up to $387m in bitcoin. It was later revealed that the organisation, which marketed itself as a bitcoin exchange, was unlikely to have handled the digital currency at all.  Last month Songmetta estimated that about 120,000 people were affected by the scheme. Losses could reach as high as 38bn Thai bhat ($1.13bn), he said.

42398372,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTL30,1432152949,Report: Lawsky to Consult on Digital Currencies After Leaving NYDFS,"New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) superintendent Benjamin M Lawsky is stepping down next month and is said to be planning to establish a legal consulting firm.  While the news created a slew of headlines, some media outlets were able to uncover new details. For example, The New York Post indicated that Lawsky would seek to advise clients on matters involving bitcoin and digital currencies, citing anonymous sources.  According to a 20th May press release, the NYDFS announced that Lawsky will leave office in late June after serving as superintendent of New York’s top banking regulator for four years.  He said in a statement:  ""I am deeply proud of the work our team has done building this new agency and helping strengthen oversight of the financial markets. We have assembled a great team at NYDFS and I have full confidence that the critical work of this agency will continue seamlessly moving forward.”  Lawsky garnered both support and criticism for his office’s development of the BitLicense, a still unreleased regulatory framework that would establish guidelines for the operation of bitcoin and digital currency businesses in New York.  Notably, a source told that publication that Lawsky has no intention of working with companies that the NYDFS regulates, a list which would likely include a number of US-based bitcoin startups serving New York.  When reached for comment, a spokesperson for the NYDFS said that the agency still anticipates releasing the final version of the BitLicense before the end of May.  The NYDFS did not immediately respond to questions related to Lawksy's proposed consulting activities.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/05/20/report-lawsky-to-consult-on-digital-currencies-after-leaving-nydfs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c821bc15829036da881d7d6beff1f497a58d9d9-2560x1959.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398382,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTL8u,1432143090,Citi: UK Government Should Create Own Digital Currency,"Citi has told the UK government it should consider creating its own digital currency, a newly obtained document has revealed.  The document, a response to the Treasury’s call for information on digital currency, was obtained by CoinDesk via a Freedom of Information request.  In the response, the global bank’s Treasury and Trade Services (TTS) Technology and Innovation Team states:  “The greatest benefits of digital currencies can be realised through the government issuing a digital form of legal tender. This currency would be less expensive, more efficient and provide greater transparency than current physical legal tender or electronic methods.”  Citi  believes governments and banks should be at the centre of the “technological shift beyond paper and credit cards” into more digital forms of money.  “To be a key participant may mean that banks and governments need to work together to develop digital currencies that supercede the existing physical and electronic solutions,” Citi adds.  It goes on to say that the act of a government issuing a digital currency would address the AML, KYC and sanctions concerns faced by market-backed digital currencies such as bitcoin. This could create privacy concerns for citizens, but Citi claims these could be offset by the additional value provided by the new currency.  Adam Cleary, a director of the UK Digital Currency Association (UKDCA), said a digital form of legal tender could improve on the current currency arrangements in the UK. However, he said these concepts “simply represent a movement to improved database technology”.  “By contrast, decentralised digital currencies such as bitcoin are an open, distributed, permissionless platform for value transfer which has the potential to drive extensive innovation in financial services independent of established institutions,” they added.  Need for regulation  In the document, which was submitted on 3rd December 2014, Citi calls for the government to introduce regulation covering digital currency companies.  It states:  “The absence of clear regulatory guidelines creates uncertainty in this space, and prevents legitimate players from entering the space. Resolving this uncertainty will allow banks to make decisions on how to approach digital currencies.”  Citi asserts that bitcoin’s underlying blockchain technology can be used in ways that will increase transparency and efficiency, benefiting not only consumers and merchants, but governments and regulators too.  Pinpointing the ways in which the government could benefit, Citi said blockchain technology can provide:  Greater transparency at the transaction level by providing an immutable record of accounting, and ability to embed automated tax collection at the transaction level, enabling governments to decrease overhead and increase efficiency.  Possibly realise benefits from financial inclusion, increasing the efficiency of government disbursements and addressing fraud and overpayments.  The company believes that, given digital currency’s “inherent ability to easily cross borders and jurisdictional controls”, an international framework should be created to regulate it effectively.  “Extensive work has been done by HM Treasury in collaboration with the UKDCA to establish a strong regulatory framework in the UK and we believe this is a good model for any international regulatory approach,” the UKDCA's Cleary added.  Citi's reply to the Treasury also calls for regulation on a national level that is based on existing laws but promotes a “pro-innovation approach” that doesn’t create hurdles and obligations that could inhibit the growth of digital currency companies.

42398378,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTL7v,1432118446,Blockchain Firm Denies 'Conflict of Interest' for Advisor Yanis Varoufakis,"Blockchain technology firm Tembusu Systems has hit back at claims Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis' role as its advisor represents a ""conflict of interest"" for the politician.  On Monday Greece's weekly paper Proto Thema produced emails from a company representative claiming Professor Varoufakis was still ""affiliated to Tembusu in an advisory role"" as recently as March 2015.  This role ""raises legitimate questions about a conflict of interest in Varoufakis’ support of an extreme albeit innovative method for financial transactions,"" the paper said.  In a statement posted online, Tembusu said Varoufakis had helped the Singaporean firm build its key foundation strategy towards the end of 2014. As a result of that contribution the company continued to recognize him as an advisor, it said.  The finance minister has not played any active role for Tembusu since his decision to stand in Greece's elections. His last contribution was in December 2014, it said.  Since the Proto Thema article appeared, Varoufakis' name and photo have been removed from Tembusu's team page.  Lack of bitcoin understanding  Proto Thema (translated as 'Lead Story') is a populist tabloid-style Greek newspaper published weekly. It is reportedly the highest-selling weekly in the country, with circulation often topping 200,000 in the small Greek market.  In its statement, Tembusu took issue with some areas of the paper's reporting. Besides describing bitcoin as ""obsolete and hazardous"", the English version of Proto Thema's article describes Tembusu as ""a controversial Singaporean company that launched the digital currency Bitcoins"".  Tembusu clarified that it had not been contacted for the story:  ""Proto Thema did not try to reach Tembusu Systems for comment at any time, which may explain many of the gaps in their reporting.""  The firm also denied it could be termed a 'bitcoin company', saying its role is developing ""blockchain technology for commercial applications, including payment systems, remittance and digital wallets"".  ""We do not deal with bitcoins or any existing cryptocurrency,"" the company added.  Varoufakis and bitcoin  Varoufakis was a well-known economist, author, speaker and media figure before becoming Greek finance minister in January. Once an economic advisor to former Greek prime minister Georges Papandreou, he now describes himself as a 'libertarian Marxist'.  He has long been interested in, if not a particularly keen supporter of, bitcoin and cryptocurrency more broadly.  His thoughts on bitcoin re-emerged in February this year, when a Guardian article pointed to blog posts from 2013 and 2014, in which Varoufakis first described his concerns with a currency not controlled by government.  The latter post described bitcoin technology as potentially beneficial in building electronic payment systems, but ""too deflationary by nature to act as a widespread currency alternative"" to the euro or dollar.  Last month he tweeted a clearly-labeled April Fools' joke in which he said Greece was prepared to ditch the euro and adopt bitcoin as its national currency if it could not secure a satisfactory deal in negotiations with the European Union over Greece's dire national debt.  Tembusu's refocus  Tembusu Systems  , which began as a company producing bitcoin ATMs, has since diverted its focus away from bitcoin and has built a new digital financial framework called TRUST.  The TRUST network is a non-bitcoin, blockchain-based system designed for the transfer and management of various assets instantaneously and worldwide.  It relies on real-life identities to build reputations and can link to existing financial institutions, remittance networks, government services, and other services for businesses and individuals.
