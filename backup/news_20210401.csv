42386366,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBShK3,1617315754,Retail Gains Amid Institutional Influx in Q1: CoinDesk Quarterly Review,"The suits are here to stay, but retail isn't going away.      That's just one of the takeaways from CoinDesk Research's hot-off-the-presses ""Quarterly Review for Q1 2020."" During the period we saw the consolidation of institutional involvement, with new names joining MicroStrategy in the bitcoin-on-balance-sheet movement, and with well-known traditional financial institutions announcing plans to roll out crypto services.      At the same time, the first quarter also saw the emergence of retail investors as a market driver. Activity on retail-focused exchanges surged along with institutional trading, which suggested growing leverage in crypto markets as retail exchanges allow more leverage than institutional exchanges do. Meanwhile, metrics showed profit-taking by larger holders.      In more than 100 slides, our Q1 review also looks at the evolution of the BTC and ETH markets, as well as developments in decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoins and – of course – non-fungible tokens (NFTs).      Crypto market infrastructure companies completed impressive fundraising rounds, and some even announced plans to go public at hefty valuations, signaling a strong belief in the potential of enduring growth and future profitability of crypto markets.      The enthusiam for crypto also started to spill over into ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, highlighting the industry’s technological progress, and a deeper understanding of the benefits of crypto asset diversification.      The explosion in interest in NFTs from investors, celebrities and the general public caught us by surprise, but in retrospect it shouldn’t have. Combining culture and connection with new technology, new experiences and astonishing prices makes for an irresistible cocktail of creativity and meme investing. Whether this is an extension of the change in investing culture that the GameStop saga highlighted or the emergence of a new type of asset classification or the development of new types of micro economies and business models or all of the above, both the hype and the substance had us transfixed.      Stablecoin developments were dominated by the surge in supply, driven in part by increased exchange and over-the-counter activity, and by the conclusion of a multi-year investigation by the New York Attorney General into the internal finances of Tether and its sister exchange, Bitfinex.      The report also looks at the growth in value held in DeFi applications, transaction growth, token appreciation and more.

42406167,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAesLY2,1617312569,IRS Seeks Names of Circle Customers Transacting Over $20K in Crypto,"The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) can move forward with its efforts to unmask high-value customers at Circle Internet Financial, a federal judge ruled Thursday.      The judge in a federal court in the District of Massachusetts authorized a request from the IRS to issue a “John Doe Summons” on all Circle and Poloniex customers who transacted $20,000 or more in crypto between 2016 and 2020. Such summons are a tactic the IRS uses to demand information on people it can not identify by name. (Circle spun out Poloniex in 2019 after buying the exchange for $400 million in 2018.)      The IRS told the court it needs the documents to ensure crypto users are paying their taxes. It believes many have not, and will now issue summons on the records to prove it. The IRS said this does not necessarily mean Circle has broken the law.      It does represent a continuation of the U.S. tax collector taking crypto investments more seriously for tax year 2020.      “Tools like the John Doe summons authorized today send the clear message to U.S. taxpayers that the IRS is working to ensure that they are fully compliant in their use of virtual currency,” IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig said in the press statement, adding:    “The John Doe summons is a step to enable the IRS to uncover those who are failing to properly report their virtual currency transactions. We will enforce the law where we find systemic noncompliance or fraud.”    The agency has previously used John Doe summons to go after Coinbase, which fought the order for more than a year before ultimately complying, divulging nearly 14,000 customer records.      ""We're reviewing, and of course expect to work collaboratively with the IRS in responding to the court order,"" Circle spokesman Josh Hawkins told CoinDesk via email.

Slipping 0.02% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $57,973.35-$59,458.98(CoinDesk 20)  BTC trades between its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a sideways signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin retreated after failing for a second day to break through price resistance at $60,000, a key psychological level that has also proven a formidable stopping point during this year’s powerful rally.      A major missing ingredient from the market recently? Spot trading volume.      Thursday’s volume has trended lower since bitcoin broke a record high on March 13, according to data from eight leading crypto exchanges tracked by CoinDesk.      “We still see the highest volume when the market sells off, which is a concern,” Arcane Research wrote in its weekly newsletter on March 30.      But to bitcoin bulls, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is likely to test a new all-time high very soon.      “Bitcoin is poised to retest the $60,000 level again,” said Jason Lau, chief operating officer at San Francisco-based crypto exchange OKCoin. “The reason for this recent rally is that bitcoin and crypto have gone mainstream.”      Despite the effete price action over the past few weeks, there’s been little slowdown in news and developments related to mainstream adoption of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies: BlackRock disclosed it has been trading bitcoin futures, PayPal said it will enable crypto payments, Goldman Sachs is getting close to offering bitcoin to its wealth management clients, and burrito chain Chipotle is doing a bitcoin giveaway.      “The normalization of crypto in daily chatter and usage is increasingly obvious,” Lau said.

Ether’s 24-hour range: $1,888.64-$1,983.45 (CoinDesk 20)  Ether trades above its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Ether has outperformed bitcoin in the past 24 hours, which could be “a signal of crypto asset rotation,” according to OKCoin’s Lau.      Alternative cryptocurrencies mostly outperformed during the first quarter, based on CoinDesk 20 data. While bitcoin logged an extraordinary 102% return, that level of performance was only good enough for 14th place in the CoinDesk quarterly ranking.      Cardano (ADA) was the top performer in terms of percentage gains, with a staggering 560% return.      The token is now the No. 5 cryptocurrency by market capitalization, behind only bitcoin, ether, Binance’s BNB token and the stablecoin tether, per Messari data.      ADA, which is the native token for the smart-contract blockchain Cardano, tripled in February alone as traders bet on the success of “Ethererum Killers.”      In March, Cardano received a price boost thanks to the so-called Coinbase effect. The U.S. cryptocurrency exchange giant listed ADA on both its institutional platform Coinbase Pro and more retail-centered Coinbase exchange in March, sending the price higher.

There's been much anticipation about the Nasdaq listing. Prices for the shares are predicted to fall between $300 and $350, valuing the trading platform at about $100 billion.

In an announcement, 3iQ Corp said CoinShares has partnered with the firm to launch the 3iQ CoinShares Bitcoin ETF. Trading under the ticker BTCQ, the vehicle for investing in bitcoin without holding the digital asset itself will be listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) in early April, pending regulatory approval.  Canada has taken the lead in North America in approving three bitcoin ETFs for crypto-curious investors. The Securities and Exchange Commission has been reticent to give the green light to a similar vehicle in the U.S., having shot down dozens of proposals in recent years. Last month, Brazil got into the act with the approval of its first bitcoin ETF.  3iQ has more than C$2 billion (US$1.59 billion) in assets under management and listed a bitcoin fund on the TSX in April last year. The 3iQ CoinShares Bitcoin ETF will have a 1% annual management fee.  In March, CoinShares began trading on the Nasdaq First North Growth Market, an alternative stock exchange for small and medium-sized growth companies in Europe, trading under the ticker CS.

The move comes a day after decentralized finance (DeFi) firm Aave also said it was exploring scalable sidechains with Polygon. The Ethereum ecosystem continues to look for methods to avoid the congested network, where fees can sometimes be higher than the transactions themselves.    Read more: DeFi Major Aave Working With Polygon to Bypass Ethereum Congestion    “As of today, the Decentraland dapps suite now features an account portal where you can move your [Decentraland token] MANA from the Ethereum blockchain to Polygon’s Matic Network (and back),” the post states.      The idea behind a layer 2 solution is that users can transfer their tokens to a sidechain link to the Ethereum blockchain, where they can transact more quickly and with much lower fees than on Ethereum itself.      ""Ethereum’s popularity and usage is increasing at an incredible rate, but this added demand on the network means users are forced to pay higher and higher gas fees in order to make sure their transactions are successful,"" said Samuel Hamilton, Community and Events lead at Decentraland, in an email. ""This is unsustainable for any dapp that makes use of thousands of microtransactions.""      Hamilton said users cannot be expected to pay tens of dollars (or more) for common, everyday actions, so dapp providers are looking for ways to scale their services. While this isn’t a new problem, he said, scalability solutions like Polygon’s are now able to provide the speed, affordability and usability (both for developers and end-users) to make a real difference.    A more holistic experience    The account portal is part of a more holistic effort to integrate all Decentraland dapps with Polygon. with the goal of letting users claim, buy, sell and trade wearables for their avatars entirely on Polygon without transaction fees.    Read more: Matic Network Now ‘Polygon’ as Platform Targets Ethereum’s L2 Woes    “While today’s release adds the ability to transfer assets in Decentraland from Etherum to Polygon, we won’t see the full effects until Decentraland’s Builder and Marketplace have been updated to support transactions on Polygon, which we can expect to see this coming May,” continues the post.      “At that point, the wearables marketplace will be open to all creators with new wearables being minted on Polygon’s Matic network.”      Hamilton said the use of sophisticated L2 solutions like those provided by Polygon are a key component of providing applications with a true use-value, and their adoption is a trend we will see continue.      ""Games and virtual worlds especially benefit from the higher throughput of sidechains,"" he said. ""Yes, the Ethereum developer community is taking steps toward more sustainable and manageable gas fees, and yes, we are on the way toward PoS, but [layer 2] solutions still have a role to play.""      The post contains further details about how to use the portal.

42406159,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAesLQA,1617300715,Former Senior Executive of Russia’s Largest Bank Leaves for Crypto Startup,"Mainstream finance professionals are making the move into crypto in growing numbers, from middle-size asset managers to the high ranks of the Financial Action Task Force. A Russian bank executive is the latest to make the leap.      Konstantin Shulga, former head of brokerage at Russia’s largest bank, Sber (formerly Sberbank), joined crypto over-the-counter (OTC) service Finery Markets in late March as its new chief executive. The firm is building an institutional peer-to-peer trading marketplace, Shulga told CoinDesk in an interview.      He went full crypto after more than a decade in institutional finance in Russia, including at a branch of UniCredit, the Moscow Exchange and Sber, which is the leading retail bank in Russia and is half-owned by the country’s government.      Sber itself is actively exploring the blockchain space and recently announced launching a digital settlement token for corporate clients, but Shulga wouldn’t say if those efforts sparked his curiosity for crypto.      He first bought bitcoin during the bull run of 2017 but sold it at around $18,000, he said, with no second thoughts afterward.      “I don’t really have time for gambling, so I don’t regret [selling],” Shulga said.      He joined Finery at the invitation of his former coworker at the asset manager ATON, Finery co-founder Ilia Drozdov. Finery’s small team, according to LinkedIn, now employs a handful of former ATON and Moscow Exchange employees.    Stirring crypto liquidity    Finery Markets is a Cyprus-based startup that aims to be something like LocalBitcoins for institutional investors. Except it’s not just bitcoin – Finery is offering funds and asset managers trading pairs between a number of cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies including U.S. dollars, euros, pound sterling, Canadian dollars and Japanese yen, Shulga said.      He said that since its launch in April 2020, Finery has brought on 30 clients so far, including asset managers, high-frequency trading firms, crypto exchanges and crypto-related services, mostly in Europe.      Using Finery, the firms’ trading volume in March reached $200 million, Shulga said. Growth has been steady: in January, volume was only $100 million, Shulga said.      Finery’s main competitors are centralized exchanges and OTC desks, Shulga said, which are also catering to institutional investors. However, “we want to convert them into our allies,” he added, explaining that integrating with Finery would provide them with more liquidity options.

42406171,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAesLa0,1617295917,The Myths and Realities of 'Green Bitcoin',"Institutions want bitcoin, but they want it their way.      In a recent CoinDesk TV appearance, famed investor and television host Kevin O’Leary said that only 10% of financial institutions that may want to invest in BTC have done so, largely due to environmental, sustainability and governance (ESG) concerns.      ""It needs to be compliant,"" O'Leary later said about bitcoin at a Cboe conference. Meaning, the bitcoin community needs to address the staggering externalities involved in minting a new monetary form: its environmental footprint and its role in helping criminals and despots avoid sanction.      The ""Shark Tank"" host went on: ""That's going to be a problem going forward.""      Bitcoin is a slowly progressing though adaptable system inching towards mainstream acceptance. Institutions, individuals and crypto-incumbents alike run the software or partake in the ecosystem and may have differing visions of what BTC is and ought to be.      Referred to as hard money, due to a key set of near-immutable attributes, bitcoin’s next phase of evolution might see it adapt to the will of old-monied institutions.      O’Leary’s critiques are hardly new. Many bitcoiners may want to write them off altogether. After all, the chairman of O'Leary Fund Management criticized crypto publicly until this year (though he now says he’s owned crypto since 2017). And many of the substantive attacks on bitcoin’s environmental footprint have an answer.      But the ""Shark Tank"" host does not swim alone. EY Blockchain Lead Paul Brody says he’s been having this same conversation about cryptocurrency’s energy consumption for the past four years.      “We have so many enterprise clients that care about this topic,” Brody told CoinDesk. “Quite a few enterprise clients have held off on doing stuff in blockchain over their concerns about the carbon footprint.”      See also: ‘Shark Tank’ Star: Wall Street Investors Need to Know How Their BTC Is Mined      While the MicroStrategys and BlackRocks of the world may be cutthroat enough to accept bitcoin as it is, environmental impact and all, there are a growing number of potentially interested parties that want a different type of bitcoin – a cleaner, more ethical coin.      Take two recent examples: Square, the payments startup, is investing in environmentally sustainable bitcoin practices while recently founded Seetee, an investment arm of Norwegian conglomerate Aker ASA, will mine BTC using “strand­ed or in­ter­mit­tent elec­tric­i­ty.”      Other firms might demand more. So what happens when those institutions get their way?    Greenwashing?    First, it might be worthwhile to consider why firms may demand net-neutral or cleaner forms of BTC. According to Brody, there are two primary causes behind the trend. First, firms may be trying to anticipate future regulatory changes.      “You don't have to be particularly woke to believe that it's very likely that industries will have a price on carbon and that we will need to decarbonize our infrastructure,” he said.    In practice, firms either get comfortable with the ESG hit of bitcoin and allocate, or they don't and stay away.    Indeed, U.S. President Joe Biden has made tackling climate change a key administrative concern. As part of a forthcoming infrastructure bill, he pledges to “achieve a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035.”      “You could do worse things and then assign a price to carbon in your own organization and start changing people's behavior in advance,” Brody said. While he admits that a blanket ban on cryptocurrency mining is unlikely in most countries – “that’s a sledgehammer approach” – industry can see which way the wind is blowing.      Second, customers (and other important stakeholders, like ESG investors) are demanding businesses adopt eco-friendly practices. From banking to energy, companies are at least feigning support for a sustainable future. It may be relevant to note the “green new deal” legislation in Congress has received as much public support as legalizing cannabis. Environmental justice remains popular.      See also: J.P. Koning – We Don’t Need the OCC’s ‘Political Discrimination’ Rule    Fractured system    Brannin McBee, co-founder of CoreWeave, says he has never been approached by a client concerned about the environmental impact of his cloud computing business. It’s the sort of double standard that exists for crypto, but not for general computing.      The firm mines various GPU-based cryptocurrencies when its main business line (cloud infrastructure) isn’t used. Due to the recent market tear, crypto now accounts for approximately 70% of CoreWeave’s revenue, McBee said.      When gaming out what might happen if ""green energy"" mandates are enacted around bitcoin, many think the market could become divided. O’Leary suggested there could be a white and black market, for coins that meet corporate compliance requirements and those that don’t.      A similar scenario was discussed last year, when the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) “Travel Rule” was being discussed. “We are going to see a bifurcation in the crypto space,” Bakkt President Adam White said at the time. “We are going to see white crypto; we are going to see gray crypto. And those different forms of crypto will most likely trade at different prices.”      McBee thinks this framing around the “dirty coin question” doesn’t exactly make sense. For one, there’s no reliable way to determine how a particular coin was minted. He argues that most BTC is produced through mining pools that draw computing power from locations across the world.      These pools “muddy the water” and make it impossible to determine if a particular mining subsidy was won by a sustainable mining operation.      Further, EY’s Brody says, the way bitcoin is typically used and stored further damps the ability for analytics firms to trace “green bitcoin.”      See also: Ben Schiller – ‘Green’ Bitcoin Is the Price of Mass Adoption      “I can know who mined a bitcoin [or make an educated guess]. But let's say I take two BTC that I got as a mining reward and I put them in a custodial account at some exchange. They don't keep all the liquidity on-chain,but move it to cold storage,” he said. “No one knows what happens to them at that point … All bets are off with inputs and outputs.”      The idea that demand for green bitcoin would therefore “fracture bitcoin’s fungibility” – or create a scenario where some BTC are more expensive because they’re more desirable virgin or ethical coins – is false. “It’s technically difficult to do, but also not really desirable,” Brody said.      One BTC will likely always be worth one BTC, because that is how the system is designed. Otherwise, what happens to the 18 million BTC that have already been mined?    Adopting a new standard    In a recent op-ed, Bloomberg columnist Noah Smith argues the Bitcoin blockchain should be switched to a less energy-intensive security mechanism. The current consensus model, proof-of-work, operates by expending energy to distribute trust across the system.      By having an open system to which anyone could contribute hash power and earn incentives for that effort, PoW prevents collusion and ensures trustworthy transactions with settlement finality. There’s no reversing the work of mining a BTC block. The large carbon footprint attached is an “unintended consequence” of the network’s success, Brody said.      See also: James Cooper – The US Can Make Bitcoin Mining Greener    The ideology is very conservative in terms of not messing around with Bitcoin.    Proof-of-stake has emerged as an experimental model to secure blockchains, by having large crypto holders stake their wealth to protect the network.      Several blockchains like Tezos, Cosmos and Polkadot have all seen success with the model, and Ethereum is in the process of transitioning to PoS. But that doesn’t mean it’s realistic for Bitcoin to adopt the novel standard, as Smith urges.      “The ideology is very conservative in terms of not messing around with Bitcoin,” Brody said. In fact, that’s part of its appeal in attracting institutions. “It's just this strong system that works.”      Speaking of working at a “conservative” institution – EY is one of the world’s oldest and largest professional services firms – Brody says there’s often a reluctance to switch to the hottest software or adopt trendy business practices if what they have is reliable.      This conservative approach to development is all the more relevant considering the lingering questions around PoS’ settlement assurances.    Skipping bitcoin    It’s possible that institutions have done the calculus and determined there’s no way to guarantee a green bitcoin. “In practice, firms either get comfortable with the ESG hit of bitcoin and allocate, or they don't and stay away. I don't see a lot of in between,” CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter said over Telegram. (Carter has written widely on Bitcoin's environmental responsibilities.) But those that stay away – the 90% of interested firms O’Leary mentioned – might allocate elsewhere in crypto.      The most obvious choice is the second-largest crypto by market cap, ether (ETH), the native currency of Ethereum. While environmental concerns also surround Ethereum, especially amid the ongoing non-fungible token (NFT) boom, at current capacity the blockchain draws about seven times less energy than Bitcoin.      Plus, as mentioned above, Ethereum is set to transition to PoS eventually.      “There are really compelling reasons for institutions to put some Ethereum on their balance sheet,” Brody said. “If they’re planning to utilize Ethereum for business operations [more than you think already do], you're going to be exposed to the price of gas"" or the cost of running an ether application.      Meitu, a Chinese software developer, has stocked up on ETH in anticipation of developing and utilizing existing Ethereum apps. Under this arrangement, crypto isn’t a hedge against inflation – the reason Square, MicroStrategy and MassMututal bought bitcoin recently – but a way to hedge against future liabilities (e.g., the price of ETH).      So is that appealing enough for other institutions to skip BTC for an altcoin? Probably not, according to Brody. Bitcoin’s sell is that it can be a counter-cyclical asset for use in corporate portfolios. While bitcoin has yet to decouple from other speculative assets and is correlated with all assets affected by macroeconomic forces, there’s an overriding belief that bitcoin could remove itself from “political manipulation.”      O’Leary didn’t respond to a request for comment. But he’s right to be concerned about bitcoin’s massive energy bill – as much as Finland consumes annually, by one measure – though there are certain facts that occlude the story he tells.      See also: Mining Bitcoin for Heat, Strawberries and Chickens      There’s no such thing as a “sustainable BTC,” nor are there easy alternatives. Institutions will judge for themselves whether to buy in, but until the global grid goes green we’ll have to put the idea of compliant bitcoin to bed.

42411157,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gj8Ajq,1617294573,‘There’s a Sense of Vindication’: A NFT Pioneer Looks to the Future,"The most expensive non-fungible token (NFT) sold in 2019 was a digital car for the blockchain racing game, F1 Delta Time (at just over $100,000, the sale seems small-fry now). At the time, the “hyper-limited” 1–1–1 was the first official Formula 1 NFT, the first car auctioned by F1 Delta Time, and the priciest virtual car in history. And no one, not even its creators at Animoca Brands, nor OpenSea, the NFT marketplace where the auction was conducted, knew who bought it.  The sale was highly controversial and widely seen as nothing more than an elaborate marketing ploy by Animoca Brands because the buyer of the NFT could not be identified. It would be more than 18 months before the owner was revealed as MetaKovan, the founder and financier of the NFT-focused crypto fund Metapurse. He (real name: Vignesh Sundaresan) recently bought an NFT from the artist Beeple for $69 million.  Leah Callon-Butler, a CoinDesk columnist, is the Director of Emfarsis, a consulting firm based in Southeast Asia that represents play-to-earn sector clients including Animoca Brands, Yield Guild Games, Blockchain Game Alliance and others.  “The 1–1–1 is indeed a unique creation and reflects MetaKovan’s convictions about this space, and about the quality and undeniable appeal of Animoca Brands’ work,” said Twobadour, a “Steward of Metapurse” and MetaKovan’s public interface. (Read this brilliant whodunnit for the full saga.)  Yat Siu, chairman of Animoca Brands, has been investing in the NFT space since early 2018. Back then, he said, it was “lonely” because there weren’t many people into NFTs. But the fledgling ecosystem needed support. So for a relatively small check amount, he could help seed the market.  The culture of NFTs will change now because a whole new set of people are coming in.  Notably, Animoca Brands was an early investor in Dapper Labs, the company behind CryptoKitties and NBA Top Shot. It also backed Decentraland, the first fully decentralized world (like Second Life on a blockchain), and NFT marketplaces including OpenSea, WAX and Bitski.  In addition to developing its own titles such as F1 Delta Time and The Sandbox, it invested in blockchain game developers Lucid Sight and Sky Mavis (the latter being the creators of the Pokémon-like fantasy battle game, Axie Infinity).  See also: How NFTs Became Art, and Everything Became an NFT  More recently, Animoca Brands joined a seed investment round for Yield Guild Games, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for game-based NFTs.  Siu says he wants to work with people who share his vision to amplify the open framework rather than reduce it or control it. After Animoca was unceremoniously deplatformed from the App Store in 2012 (at the time it was one of the world’s top mobile game developers), he experienced at first hand the value of open and permissionless communities.  Ever since, he’s been a crusader for digital property rights, a concept gamers understand. They don’t find it difficult to imagine owning a virtual car or buying a piece of virtual land and building something on it. Even if they have no understanding of blockchain and no exposure to NFTs, gamers have a natural affinity to the idea of digital ownership. It's not alien to them to spend some money on virtual goods or virtual assets.  An advocate for freedom, individual expression and radical inclusion, Siu views NFTs as the asset-centric mechanism to deliver true digital rights in virtual worlds and beyond, allowing us to express ourselves and tell stories about our identity through the virtual things that we own.  See also: Callon-Butler - The NFT Game That Makes Cents for Filipinos During COVID  The following is a condensed excerpt from a longer conversation I had with Siu about his goals for the “metaverse” – the idea of an extensive virtual economy where NFTs and our digital selves reside.  How does it feel now everyone has gone crazy for NFTs?  It's amazing, right? There’s definitely a sense of vindication for those of us in the industry. Because we had a mission that we believed in and we decided to see it through.  But the space is also becoming very competitive. I used to have a good view as to what was going on. I don't anymore. All sorts of projects are coming through which are run by people who didn't even know what an NFT was barely a month ago. And there's also a lot of money involved now. So I think there's a hype cycle happening.  What is it like to have all these outsiders suddenly giving you their opinions on NFTs?  Before this, we [the NFT community] were just talking to each other in an echo chamber. So we were all bouncing off each other's ideas and we weren't thinking about other ways of doing or approaching things because we were always just agreeing with each other.  And now, you’ve got some people saying very negative things about NFTs. Some are poorly informed but others have a real point.  I think that this discourse is good and healthy because it gives us a bit of a wake-up call. I'm not saying that NFTs are necessarily harmful; I'm just saying that we seldom thought of these other perspectives because we were the early innovators.  Which is why it’s important to invite and embrace other viewpoints, including the negative ones.  See also: How to Create, Buy and Sell NFTs  How do you think this will affect your industry moving forward?  The culture of NFTs will change now because a whole new set of people are coming in. And it's causing some ripples. For us, it's a bit awkward because we're listening and observing but not yet sure how to participate in this new conversation.  It reminds me of the early internet days where the internet purists were saying, ‘This has to be open source, or it has to be this way, or whatever.' And then a bunch of commercial guys went in and created the necessary frameworks but they upset some of the original guys along the way.  That's happening in NFTs now and there will be more turbulent times ahead. But it'll be fun and it'll be adventurous because we’re in this with a very, very long view.  How can you be tolerant of newcomers when they oppose what you believe in?  To have a truly diverse mindset, we need to have a strong sense of empathy. Empathy is one of those things that has been sorely lacking in the world as of late. I think it's related to how we were brought up, how we've been educated and, also, the status and situation of the world.  See also: Whale Shark’s NFT Collectors Playbook  For many of us, we think our own viewpoint is the correct viewpoint and we've forgotten how to listen to others.  How can NFTs cultivate a diverse mindset?  We're all born slightly different, we come in different flavors and we all experience the world in different ways. The internet has brought that together in a magnified way.  But now, we’re in a digital fortress designed by a few central groups. It was not like this 20+ years ago, when the narrative of the early internet guys was all about freedom of information, freedom of access and freedom of everything.  Blockchain is bringing that back. And NFTs are bringing it back, but with culture. To us, an open framework that allows you to do whatever you want with your digital assets will achieve impact in the realm of diversity because we all have different preferences and desires.  That’s important because now we can have free and open culture everywhere. You can’t get rid of it. It can’t be removed. That, to me, is where it’s exciting.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MANA,Leah Callon-Butler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/04/01/theres-a-sense-of-vindication-a-nft-pioneer-looks-to-the-future,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/44a81c3698c7cff18faad07883987c39be746c18-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42406172,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAesLcx,1617294286,Uniswap’s 'Token' Issue,"Uniswap, the popular Ethereum-based decentralized exchange, is once again thought to be too centralized for some. A token project launched, messed up the protocol’s data aggregator and forced a reaction from Uniswap that is now raising questions about what level of control creators can exercise in crypto.      In short: Delta Financial is a new token project looking to solve liquidity problems in decentralized options trading. The DELTA token launched on Uniswap on March 28. A day later, Uniswap’s total volume had exploded 450% to $7.17 billion (up from $1.6 billion the day before, and more than triple the previous record high of $2.19 billion set Oct. 26, 2020). This information is all based on reporting from Decrypt, due to what happened next.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Determining that this growth was organic, though perhaps inauthentic, Uniswap’s developers issued a hotfix to remove Delta’s data from its blockchain explorer, Uniswap.info, under a “fix for scammy tokens.” Though the token itself remains available to trade on the decentralized exchange, querying for its trading activity returns “🤔.” Etherscan is also blank.      The situation speaks to the difficulty of determining what the “public good” is in decentralized ecosystems. There’s tension among creators of tokens, who are free to list their projects, creators of decentralized platforms, who have multi-billion dollar protocols to maintain, and everyone else, who may be hurt by the decisions made by either of those other parties.      Delta is a token system that could potentially solve a real issue in the space. Users vest their tokens for two weeks after every transfer, providing a guaranteed lock-up period and therefore a knowable metric for creating cheap, short-term options contracts. It’s novel, if nerdy. The system also employs a “rebasing” mechanism to stabilize the token’s price, essentially by trading these locked-up coins against themselves. (Decrypt offers a plausible explanation for why this system isn’t wash trading.)      All of this activity appeared on Uniswap’s records, potentially creating a false impression of the exchange's activity. “Delta found a cool growth hack, but it does not seem like the type of information users are looking for when they want [decentralized exchange] volume stats,” an uninvolved but knowledgeable observer who runs another blockchain data service told CoinDesk.      As Uniswap’s founder, Hayden Adams, said on Twitter: “This should be fairly obvious but saying Uniswap protocol did $7.3b in trading volume on //info.uniswap.org when $6.3b of that is a weird rebasing mechanism on one token makes the entire site less useful.”      But in removing this information, Adams may have crossed a line. Uniswap has been characterized as a VC-captured exchange in the past. This summer’s batter with rival, ""community-owned"" SushiSwap brought this to the fore. Now, Adams is exercising discretion over to what information users are privy. While the actual exchange is decentralized, there are parts that are human controlled.      Adams didn’t return a request for comment, though 0xRevert, a developer for Delta’s parent company, CORE Vault, did. I asked if the project was just a social experiment and, if so, what message were they were trying to send.      “Exposing the hypocrisy of Uniswap to more people. While pretending to be a community-governed decentralized exchange, they seem to only care about their VCs interests,” 0xRevert said. “I'm working on an innovative new protocol and I'm very surprised that Uniswap would move to stifle innovation. I had great respect for them before this move, which is why DELTA is even on Uniswap.”      He echoed complaints others have made, that Uniswap has failed to remove information related to suspected scams. Further, that many DeFi neophytes may confuse Uniswap.info as the exchange’s front end.      For its part, Uniswap has found itself integral to an industry where decentralization is a bit of a hobbyhorse, though not just a token issue.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TRADING | UNI | ZRX,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/01/uniswaps-token-issue,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/960099c288e0162e025a50af1fb56c29fc84d586-1944x1210.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Back then, the monthly miner revenue sat at $329 million. Since then, the revenues have increased by 373%,” according to a new report by Arcane Research, a Norwegian analysis firm.  Miners are awarded bitcoin whenever they add a new block of transactions to the blockchain, which they can later sell on the market to fund operating costs or simply just to cash out. Transaction fees are another source of revenue.  “The recent mining revenue spike is rewarding miners who already had a well-established setup before the bitcoin bull run, or great foresight in Q3 2020.”  New mining equipment is estimated to be delivered around November 2021 and January 2022, which could contribute to greater computational power (hashrate) used to mine and process transactions, according to Arcane.

The series is split up into two seasons, the Spring and Fall seasons.      In an announcement, BLAST Premier said the partnership means the Coinbase branding will feature across the Spring Showdown from April 13-18 and the finals from June 15-20.      Last year, BLAST Premier was live streamed around the world in 105 territories to over 151 million households, according to the esports media network.

Liquality is a browser extension wallet like Metamask, except instead of supporting only ether and its tokens, Liquality can hold bitcoin, ether, crypto dollars like DAI, USDT, USDC and UNI, and now “bitcoin DeFi” tokens from the RSK network.      The ConsenSys-backed wallet launched last autumn and allows users to swap coins in their wallet, thanks to an old trick known as “on-chain atomic swaps.” These swaps use complex cryptography to trade assets from different blockchains between two or more parties without a user having to relinquish their keys to a counterparty.      For Liquality, this means its users can trade between bitcoin and ether (or crypto dollars like USDC) right on the wallet.      “Our goal has always been to give people secure and easy tools to interact with this new digital economy,” the wallet's marketing director, Alex Min, told CoinDesk.    Liquality wants to simplify crypto wallet UX    With this update, the wallet now also provides “one-click” transactions with popular bitcoin-accepting gift-card vendor Bitrefill and payment portal OpenNode, among others. When checking out using these services, the wallet automatically fetches the receiving address for the user.      The one-click pay feature works with any wallet that has integrated URI schemes for bitcoin, Min told CoinDesk. This includes popular open-source processor BTCPay Server, as well.      “We believe this upcoming release will not only improve the in-browser bitcoin experience for users, merchants and app developers (most of whom are still transacting on-chain), but also help the nascent Bitcoin web app ecosystem grow with an easy-to-use-and-develop-with, in-browser hot wallet,” Min said.      Liquality currently acts as the counterparty for the wallet’s swaps. Min told CoinDesk the wallet processed $4 million in swap volume in March from 4,000 active weekly users.      When asked if Liquality will look to adding Lightning Network support in the future, Min said it’s not high up on the wallet’s roadmap.      In lieu of Lightning, Liquality recently integrated with RSK, a Bitcoin sidechain built by IOV Labs, and supports the dollar on chain (DOC) crypto dollar, a dollar-pegged coin which can be used on the Sovryn decentralized lending market built on RSK.      These networks offer cheaper, faster transactions than Bitcoin's primary network using special trade-offs and tricks; Lightning is a tech stack built on top of bitcoin that is trustless and non custodial, while RSK is an independent network run by a federation of trusted counterparties.",POSITIVE,BTC | UNI | DAI | USDC,BTC | MARKET | UNI | DAI | USDC,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/04/01/liquality-adds-new-1-click-pay-feature-looks-toward-bitcoin-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cdfbfaa13987ee2fa4a7f9cc973052ae4bc17f75-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406162,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAesLU6,1617287458,S. Korea’s Crypto Rules Might Only Help the ‘Big 4’ Exchanges,"As U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, the Central Bank of Nigeria and India’s Parliament have demonstrated, governments and regulators around the world are wary about the rise of cryptocurrency. South Korean authorities are no exception. Lee Ju-yeol, the governor of the Bank of Korea, said before a parliamentary committee last month that bitcoin “has no intrinsic value” and that he “doesn’t understand why the value is so high.”      While the Korean government doesn’t seem bent on banning crypto, it is certainly intent on regulating it. The effect may be monopolization by South Korea’s largest exchanges at the expense of smaller competitors.      One critical piece of legislation is called the “Act on Reporting and Using Specified Financial Transaction Information,” aka the Financial Transaction Reports Act (FTRA), which requires virtual asset service providers to register with financial authorities and comply with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. The FTRA was amended to restrict crypto trading in March of last year, but it only went into effect on March 25, 2021. It’s critical because it causes all sorts of bureaucratic and administrative complications for crypto exchanges that wish to enter the market or simply survive.      Starting March 25, all cryptocurrency exchanges are required to register with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the Financial Services Commission (FSC). The FIU will then file the registration with the FSC, which must approve the registration before it becomes official. So while the government is packaging it as a “registration process,” the FSC is actually becoming the unofficial state licensor of the Korean crypto industry.      Until the FTRA was amended by the National Assembly, South Korea had no specific legal language to define or describe crypto trading. Cryptocurrency wasn’t (and still isn’t) officially recognized as a financial asset, so there was no way to regulate it as such. Pretty much anyone who wanted to could set up an exchange and was not required to register with any authorities.      The FTRA is South Korea’s nod to the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF). It’s basically Seoul’s way of telling the world, “We comply with the FATF’s AML guidelines.” Legislators now define cryptocurrencies as “virtual assets” and crypto exchanges as “virtual asset service providers.” A VASP has been defined as any business that facilitates sales, purchases, exchanges and transfers of crypto that involve fiat. This includes exchanges, custodies and brokers. Interestingly enough, peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms and crypto consultants (people who just provide information) do not qualify as VASPs, mostly because they don’t deal directly with fiat.      That’s the keyword: fiat. So long as a Korean’s bitcoin or ether or dogecoin is never converted to Korean won, the government doesn’t seem to care about it. Until we see the day when people actually use crypto as an everyday form of payment to the point that it rivals or supplants cash, the government probably won’t try to tax crypto in its native form.      Officially, the government’s concerns about crypto are rooted in money laundering or “protecting” consumers.      But perhaps what’s really grabbed the authorities’ attention is the explosive increase in crypto trading volume over the past few years. The nation’s crypto trade is dominated by four major exchanges: Bithumb, Upbit, Korbit and Coinone. (I’ll now refer to these as the Big 4.) In just January and February of this year, the Big 4 saw 445 trillion won (US$391.7 billion) in trading volume. For some context, their cumulative trading volume for the entire year of 2019 was 488 trillion won ($394.3 billion). The Big 4’s daily trading volume for these two months averaged at 8 trillion won ($7 billion), nearly a fourfold increase from the same period in 2017.    More complicated than it seems    Some of you may be thinking: OK, exchanges have to register with authorities. So what? Just register and if you’re legit you’ll get approved. As long as you’re not doing anything shady you shouldn’t have anything to worry about, right?      In theory, yes. In practice, most likely not.      There are certain conditions an exchange must meet in order to have its registration “approved” by the FSC. By far the most important of these conditions is the need to form partnerships with local commercial banks.      Before the FTRA amendment, users on crypto platforms could register under various user names and deposit cash into a company bank account to purchase intra-platform credits that could be used to purchase crypto. These company accounts are referred to as “hive accounts” because a single account houses multiple users. While a thorough investigation would eventually reveal who deposited how much from which account, a hive account makes it much more difficult to keep track of who’s who.      The FTRA update, however, requires users to register under their real names and link their personal bank accounts. In other words, goodbye hive accounts. This necessitates partnerships with commercial banks, meaning the new legislation gives banks the ultimate authority to determine which exchanges survive. Some crypto purists won’t be happy about this because it essentially negates one of the foundational principles behind crypto: freedom from traditional financial institutions.      But in South Korea, banks have the authority to determine whether or not a VASP meets AML standards. Every bank has its own criteria, which are not made public, but there are two universal conditions: VASPs must differentiate between native assets and customer deposits, and they must have their information security management systems (ISMS) certified by the Korea Internet and Security Agency (KISA). ISMS certification has proven to be time-consuming and costly. It usually entails a hefty consulting bill and expensive hardware. While this may not be a problem for the Big 4, it could be a barrier to smaller and mid-sized exchanges and startups.      But here’s the kicker: The Big 4 already have partnerships with commercial banks, which have been reluctant to partner with smaller exchanges. Banks are naturally conservative and averse to risk, so they tend to prefer major players over the little guys.      So if an exchange wants to become legit, it needs a bank partnership. Because banks have the ultimate say in who gets those partnerships, they have the ultimate say in which exchanges survive.      ""Crypto startups that aren't on a major corporate scale will have a hard time getting their ISMS certified, acquiring bank partnerships and meeting other conditions for VASP registration,"" said Ku Tae-eon, an attorney with the strategic consulting firm Tek & Law, at a conference co-hosted by CoinDesk Korea in November. Ku argued that the revised FTRA will shrink the nation’s crypto industry. He has called for separate legislation specific to crypto.      But even the Big 4 seem on edge. Bithumb, the biggest of the four, recently began delisting dark coins in what looks like a campaign to seem more “legitimate.” Trading for three dark coins (cryptocurrencies that offer greater anonymity) on Bithumb ceased on March 24, a day before VASP registration began. Coincidence? Probably not.      The registration deadline is Sept. 24. Any VASP that fails to register or has its registration denied will be shut down. Sure, it could continue operating as a P2P platform, but the majority of Korean traders will likely flock to the Big 4 for the same reason most people look to Google for searches even if there are other options: it’s just more convenient. Plus, the average Korean investor (especially newcomers) will most likely want to use fiat for their crypto purchases.      Naturally, industry insiders are predicting the Big 4 (out of an estimated 200) will ultimately be the only crypto exchanges with fiat on-ramps. CoinDesk Korea’s Park Geun-mo and Kim Dong-hwan cautiously predict that maybe one or two could be added to the list at most. “Until September rolls around there’s no way to tell what will actually happen, but it doesn’t look good for the smaller exchanges,” Park told me.      Once their hive accounts are stripped away, smaller exchanges will struggle to survive because it’s virtually impossible for them to secure partnerships with banks. Banks will probably deem their AML systems unfit. As banks ultimately bear responsibility if any funds are used for money laundering or terrorism financing, there’s no reason for them to risk partnering with a smaller exchange.    Survival of the coziest    The bottom line is that after Sept. 24, it’s going to become that much harder for an outsider to build up the specs to compete against the Big 4 or even qualify as a registered VASP. Furthermore, any up-and-coming cryptocurrency that seeks to have a significant impact on the Korean market will have to get listed on the Big 4. There have been reports of Busan Bank holding talks with five other exchanges about potential partnerships, but things are still up in the air. A source at Busan Bank has made it clear to CoinDesk Korea that “considering partnerships and making them actually happen are totally separate things.”      While Busan Bank is a regional bank and isn’t as big as national names like Shinhan or Woori, it’s still a commercial bank that would help legitimize an up-and-coming exchange.      On March 16, the FSC issued a “warning” to crypto traders to “check the registration status” of exchanges and to “determine whether an exchange will be sustainable in the long term” before creating an account and using the platform. This is being read as a de facto declaration that a significant number of exchanges will be shut down. It may as well read: “Don’t bother trading crypto unless it’s on the Big 4.”      As if a signal of things to come, OKEx Korea recently announced it will shut operations next month, citing unsatisfactory profits and the difficulty of forming a bank partnership.      Funny enough, Korea’s crypto ecosystem could end up mirroring South Korea’s overall economy, where a small number of conglomerates comprise a majority of economic productivity. According to the Korea CXO Institute, 64 chaebols (family-owned conglomerates) comprised 84% of the country’s GDP but only 10% of jobs in 2019.      Of course, there’s a silver lining. The average investor will certainly benefit from crypto becoming institutionalized and going mainstream. Services on the Big 4 will probably get much more convenient and more accessible as time goes on. But much as how I can basically choose between LG or Samsung when buying a refrigerator, average Korean retail investors will most likely be trading their crypto on the Big 4.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Felix Im,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/04/01/s-koreas-crypto-rules-might-only-help-the-big-4-exchanges,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eded1473ea9c4bbd7b190f2ba9b36ee77eee5fdd-1500x1002.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A’s President Dave Kaval tweeted Wednesday that crypto broker Voyager Digital had become the first buyer of a full-season suite at the Oakland Coliseum.  The team announced March 14 it was selling private suites for the full 2021 season for either $64,800 or 1 BTC.  The bitcoin paid by Voyager Digital was worth about $59,240 at the time of Kaval’s tweet.  However, one must wonder what the firm’s cost basis was for the transacted bitcoin. Voyager Digital’s Stephen Ehrlich started as CEO in January 2018, when bitcoin was trading around $12,000.  Kaval told Bloomberg on March 26 the A’s would hodl any bitcoin received from such sales and not convert it into fiat.  “The price of a season suite may fluctuate depending on when it’s purchased, which adds to the excitement,” Kaval said when the scheme was announced.  The A’s start the 2021 baseball season tonight in a home game against the Houston Astros.

42406174,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAesLdw,1617285281,DOGE Jumps After Tesla's Musk Promises 'Literal' Moonshot,"Cryptocurrency markets have matured in the past 12 months, with macroeconomics and blockchain-technology developments influencing prices more than ever and new Wall Street firms buying in seemingly every other day.      So it's refreshing that dogecoin (DOGE), which was created in 2013 as a joke, continues to be a source of amusement even as it, too, shows signs of leaving its playful puppy days behind.      The digital token, symbolized by the Shiba Inu dog breed, shot up to a six-week high Thursday after a tweet by Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur whose DOGE-friendly announcements earlier this year have also led to rapid price increases.      ""SpaceX is going to put a literal dogecoin on the literal moon,"" Musk tweeted at around 10:25 UTC (6:25 a.m. ET) today. Musk's tweet did not explain how this seemingly impossible feat would be accomplished, as by definition digital currencies have no physical structures and therefore aren't literal anythings. Perhaps the tweet being sent on April Fool's may have had something to do with it.      April Fool's Day joke or not, the tweet by the noted DOGE whisperer sent the cryptocurrency bounding from roughly $0.053 to $0.070, according to data provider CoinGecko. The 32% rise took the cryptocurrency to the level last seen on Feb. 13 and marked the end of a week-long slumber in the range of $0.050-$0.055. The token's market capitalization is now $8.2 billion.      Musk has previously called dogecoin ""the people's crypto"" and the cryptocurrency of Mars.      The billionaire investor also warned of too much concentration in the cryptocurrency in February, triggering a price drop. Last month, Musk supported the idea of DOGE's listing on the U.S.-based Coinbase exchange.      While it appears as though the price of dogecoin is at the mercy of Musk’s usually humorous tweets, largely because of the publicity he's given it, the digital token is now actually being used for purposes that are not just about speculation and yuks.      Also read: Dogecoin Bounds Onto 1,800 ATMs in the US      Companies such as medical-supplier CovCare, sports brand Wooter Apparel and basketball team Dallas Mavericks have adopted dogecoin as an alternative means of payment. Meanwhile, the surge in the token's price has caused technical development on the cryptocurrency to resume, threatening to turn the lighthearted token into a much more serious breed of DOGE.      Should that happen, the world of crypto will have a little less joy in it.      The cryptocurrency's price had already started returning to Earth as this story was being written: As of press time, the price had fallen back to 6.1 cents, trimming the day's gains to 14%.",POSITIVE,DOGE,BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/01/doge-jumps-after-teslas-musk-promises-literal-moonshot,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/64a5092ca947b5628e6f6e6a265feef03b7355d6-1200x888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

New research from Glassnode, an on-chain data platform, shows continued growth in bitcoin (BTC) held between one month and six months, indicating strong conviction behind the recent price rally.      These coins were accumulated throughout the recent bull market, which means new HODLers (meaning, those holding crypto) are sitting on a near 500% increase since October.    These HODLers were “forged in the dynamic market rallies brought on in 2020 and 2021,” according to Glassnode. “Many are on their way to becoming classified as long-term holder coins.”  BTC purchased between $10,800 and $58,800 now represents 25% of the total supply with no sign of slowing down, based on Glassnode’s data.  This means HODLers have continued to accumulate BTC throughout this bull market.  ""HODLed coins are beginning to mature, and continued outflows from exchanges demonstrates accumulation is not slowing down,"" according to Glassnode.    Also, more BTC investors are moving their holdings into storage, which suggests less interest in short-term trading. Over the past 12 months, over 3% of the circulating BTC supply has migrated out of exchanges and into third-party wallets, according to Glassnode.      “Only two major exchanges have seen aggregate positive inflows (increased balances), Binance and Gemini. Gemini inflows will also correlate with Gemini’s institutional custody solutions, which further adds to the supply held in long-term storage.”      “Strong signals of accumulation show a supply vs. demand balance that is unlike any bull cycle we have seen before,” wrote Glassnode.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Damanick Dantes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/01/bitcoin-newbies-are-hodling-as-prices-rise-blockchain-data-suggests,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/30874da3524cb56e9884631dc76d1076cd6e67ca-1300x756.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a report by Bloomberg Law on Wednesday, Ian Rooney will head Coinbase's enterprise compliance team to ensure a smooth run in the lead-up to the exchange's direct listing, recently pushed back from March to April.      Coinbase, like other large U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges, wants to appear completely above board in the eyes of regulators, particularly around sensitive areas like money laundering, which is often seen as naturally suited to crypto. The addition of Rooney should also be helpful as virtual asset firms face an onerous set of anti-money laundering (AML) rules courtesy of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), with progress to be reviewed in June.      Earlier this month, Coinbase's intentions for a direct listing reportedly faced a review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Around the same time, it was reported Coinbase agreed to a $6.5 million settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over allegations the exchange “self-traded” digital assets between 2015 and 2018.      Rooney's hiring comes after the exchange nabbed former SEC official Brett Redfearn on Tuesday as the vice president of its capital markets division.

The Japanese regulator announced Wednesday the FATF rule requiring virtual asset service providers to share transaction data of senders and recipients will be adopted in the country by April 2022.  The travel rule was created to prevent cryptocurrencies from being used for money laundering and terrorist financing.  The FSA requested the Japan Virtual and Crypto Assets Exchange Association (JVCEA) advise its members to prepare for this implementation.  South Korea’s Financial Services Commission brought anti-money laundering safeguards into force on March 25 to get in line with the FATF’s rules.  This led to the South Korean arm of crypto exchange OKEx to decide to cease operations, citing the difficulty in navigating the new regulatory hurdles.

42386340,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSXRN,1617271938,Options Market Shows Call Bias as Bitcoin Prepares for New Price High,"Bullishness looks to be building in the bitcoin options listed on the dominant Deribit exchange, with the cryptocurrency trading just 4.6% short of a new record high.    Options skew, which measures the difference between the call implied volatility and put implied volatility for all options, is creeping up, as tweeted by the options analytics platform Genesis Volatility.  In plain English, that means call options are again drawing greater demand or premium than puts in a sign of bullish bias.  Implied volatility refers to investors' expectations for price turbulence over a specific period and positively impacts the option's price. Hence, an uptick in the call-put implied volatility spread is considered a sign of bullish positioning.  A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A put option gives the buyer the right to sell.  Both short- and long-term skews are ticking higher. The call bias had weakened in the second half of March, with bitcoin witnessing a healthy bull market correction from the record high of $61,557 to $50,400.  Bitcoin is currently trading near $59,800 at press time, representing a 5.6% gain on the week, as per CoinDesk 20 data.  According to Swiss-based options analytics firm Laevitas, ""fireworks will ensue"" once the psychological resistance of $60,000 is breached.  Traders are positioning for a solid rally in the short term via deep out-of-the-money calls such as the one at $80,000.  At press time, the total open interest in the $80,000 call option is more than 5,000 contracts, the highest among options listed on Deribit with an April 30 expiry.  Some analysts say the daily chart flag breakout – a bullish chart pattern – has opened the doors for a rally to at least $70,000 in the next few weeks. The flag pattern, however, is disputed, as discussed Wednesday.
