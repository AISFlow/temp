42385209,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAni9b,1606778755,Crypto Version of 'Giving Tuesday' Returns With 10 Times as Many Charities,"With the holiday season approaching and cryptocurrencies led by bitcoin (BTC) surging in price, charities are warming to the opportunity to accept donations of the digital tender.      Slated for Dec. 1, the crypto rendition of the annual worldwide charity event #GivingTuesday – #BitcoinTuesday – is back for another year, spearheaded by crypto donations platform The Giving Block.      According to the organization, while last year’s Bitcoin Tuesday event managed to attract only 12 non-profits, this year over 120 such organizations, including Save the Children, No Kid Hungry and The Tor Project have signed up for the event. The non-profits will accept donations in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and litecoin (LTC), among others.      “In general, as the price goes up, you see a lot more donations. And we saw that happen a lot in 2017,” said Alex Wilson, co-founder of the Giving Block, adding that donations may even rise because people may look to offset their tax liability amid rising prices for crypto assets.      While charity is its own reward, making the donation in cryptocurrencies can help users avoid some capital gains taxes they might otherwise have incurred had they cashed out their crypto and donated fiat, tax experts have noted.      Because cryptocurrencies are treated like property by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and some other tax agencies around the world, taxable events occur every time a user converts crypto to fiat.      But like stock donations, users can donate cryptocurrencies, get a tax write-off and not have to worry about paying capital gains tax on the cryptocurrency they donate.    Diversifying donations    Hope for Haiti, a nonprofit organization that works toward improving education, health and water facilities for residents of the Caribbean nation, is one the charities accepting crypto donations. According to the non-profit’s CEO, Skyler Badenoch, the idea was spurred in part by a need to diversify donation sources. So it did some research on the market.      “We know how much litecoin it would take to pay a teacher’s salary, we know how much XRP it would take to plant a tree,” said Badenoch. He noted tthe non-profit is also keen on exploring how blockchain technology can help add transparency to the charity sector.      A non-profit focused on tackling child hunger in the United States, No Kid Hungry, is another organization that will be taking part in the Bitcoin Tuesday campaign. The non-profit, similar to Hope for Haiti, also indicated it swaps gifted crypto for fiat upon receipt.      “Similar to stock donations, we convert cryptocurrency donations into U.S. dollars immediately,” said Diane Clifford, managing director of constituency development at No Kid Hungry.    A bitcoin tradition    In addition to the Giving Block campaign, users can also make crypto donations through BitGive.      Founded in 2013, BitGive helped co-host one of the first Bitcoin Giving Tuesday events in 2014 and has since continued to support charities in the United States and overseas. The first crypto-specific registered non-profit organization, BitGive uses the Bitcoin blockchain and RSK sidechain to help donors see where the money is going.      “We tackled these more simple concepts many years ago,” said founder Connie Gallippi. “We are excited to now have grown and developed a sophisticated platform leveraging the technology directly and demonstrating the beauty of bitcoin and blockchain to a mainstream audience.”      Since those early days, BitGive has added a layer of transparency through its GiveTrack tool, allowing donors to follow the money and see where and how it is allocated. Some of its most recent project announcements include partnerships with Heifer International, an organization that works to eradicate hunger and poverty, and Black Girls Code.      In an effort to give newcomers to crypto donations an easy way to donate, BitGive has announced that donors can now make donations on its GiveTrack platform using credit/debit cards or Apple Pay through Wyre.      “Our platform will automatically convert their donation into bitcoin and send BTC to the charity's wallet,” said Gallippi in an email. She added that this way mainstream users who have never owned cryptocurrencies could take advantage of the blockchain-associated transparency without the hassle or friction of having to buy some.",POSITIVE,BTC | LTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | LTC | REGULATION,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/11/30/crypto-version-of-giving-tuesday-returns-with-10-times-as-many-charities,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b31ea31a0143b3561ad339db1463bee0405fb9a2-1200x841.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Meanwhile, ether options traders are paying heavy premiums on the asset’s potential to hit new records as well.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $19,436 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 6.6% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $18,093-$19,850  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price hit an all-time high in the past 24 hours, trading as much as $19,850, according to CoinDesk 20 data. The price then dipped and was at $19,436 as of press time.      Read More: Bitcoin Price Sets New Record High Above $19,783      “Institutional inflows may have been much of the driving force behind this rally, but it’s been retail investors that have helped bitcoin pick up steam in recent weeks,” said Zac Prince, chief executive officer of crypto lender BlockFi. ”Balances on our retail accounts have grown over 25% in the last 30 days, compared to just under 10% for institutional,” he added.      Major spot exchanges, where retail customers casually buy the world’s oldest cryptocurrency, have seen an uptick. Combined daily volume for Coinbase, Bitstamp, Kraken, Gemini and ItBit was at $1.5 billion as of press time Monday, much higher the $488 million average of the past six months.      The steady rise of bitcoin’s price since Saturday followed a drop during a market holiday in the U.S. last week that bitcoin as low as $16,242 on Thursday. The $3,608 price gain over the past week shows just how volatile cryptocurrency can often be.      ""Bitcoin investors sitting on the sidelines of this recent rally got a Thanksgiving holiday gift as bitcoin saw a drop from $19,500 to $16,300,” noted Jason Lau, COO of San Francisco-based OKCoin. “Derivative liquidations led the move down as some derivatives exchanges lost over 20% of open interest,” he added.      Indeed, liquidations on derivatives exchange BitMEX, while not as significant of a venue as it once was, clearly had some impact on Thursday’s drop ($10 million in sell liquidations in an hour) and Monday’s rise ($4 million in by liquidations within an hour). A liquidation on BitMEX is akin to a margin call whereby a long is sold or a short triggers a buy to close out a position if it moves enough to wipe out the margin.      Bitcoin’s recent rise was not solely due to retail investors. Rich Rosenblum, who heads trading at crypto firm GSR, noted how much more infrastructure is in place for institutions to invest compared to bitcoin’s last bull run in 2017.      “The trading, settlement and custody services are all far more sophisticated and mature, which instills confidence,” he said. “The [Federal Reserve] continues to fan the flames with its monetary strategy, which looks to remain in place in the year to come. With so much excess liquidity in the system, the original investment case for bitcoin is being vindicated.”    Ether traders paying for bullish bets    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether, was up Monday trading around $605 and climbing 8.5% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

The bullish activity is so strong traders are doling out high premiums to make bullish bets on ether, noted Magadini. “Traders were quick to start paying higher prices for calls,” he told CoinDesk. “So much so that ... puts are 25 implied volatility points cheaper. This level of differential is rare and quite extreme.”      The all-time high of ether is $1,432, according to CoinDesk 20 data.

Castle Rock, Colo.-based mining firm Riot Blockchainhttps://hashrateindex.com/stocks/riot (RIOT) ended November with a 160% gain trading at $8.45 per share. Las Vegas-based Marathon Patent Group (MARA) also soared over 190% in November, the firm’s largest monthly percentage gain, up over 600% year to date.  Miner manufacturer Canaanhttps://hashrateindex.com/stocks/can (CAN) ended November with a record monthly gain of nearly 140%, with its American depositary receipts trading at $4.99 by Monday close.    Riot’s gains come amid its accumulation of thousands of the industry’s leading mining machines, according to Thomas Heller, chief operating officer at mining software company HASHR8.      “Riot expects to have a total of 22,640 miners deployed by June 2021, and the majority of them are S19 Pro miners,” Heller said. “Along with the M30S++, the S19 Pro is the most powerful and efficient miner on the market, and commands the highest market price.”      Riot also nearly tripled the dollar value of bitcoin holdings, per the company's Q3 earnings, reaching $9 million, up from $3.1 million during the same period in 2019. Marathon also reported a triple-digit percentage increase in its bitcoin holdings after a record-setting quarter of mining revenue in Q3.      Canaan’s gains come as a relief to shareholders who suffered a 85% drawdown at the end of Q3 from its initial list price in November 2019. To date in Q4, Canaan shares are still down 18 percent.      Strong demand for new machines by miners holds promise for Canaan, which reported a $12 million Q3 loss Monday. Heller told CoinDesk, “Current orders with Canaan won't ship until April due to the high demand for ASIC miners.”      Shares of other public mining companies also saw triple-digit percentage gains in November. For example, Vancouver-based Hive Blockchain (HVBTF) gained more than 160% in the month with over-the-counter shares trading hands at $1.23 by market close Monday.      “Mining stocks are a very attractive way for investors to get upside exposure to [the] bitcoin price while being limited on the downside due to the infrastructure nature of the business,” said Ethan Vera, co-founder of mining company Luxor Technologies, in a direct message with CoinDesk.      “The best mining companies can deliver profits in bear markets and have outsized returns in bull runs,” Vera said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/30/riot-marathon-canaan-see-record-monthly-share-gains-as-bitcoin-clears-all-time-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e44872dc34ec0070f888cb51f43a34a2c57efde2-1033x697.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385219,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAniIP,1606767657,Bitcoin's All-Time High Price Rally Is Sustainable. Analysts Explain Why,"While some near-term pricing correction is likely to be expected, analysts who spoke to CoinDesk said bitcoin's latest rally will be more sustainable for the long term compared with 2017, the last time bitcoin’s price hit an all-time high.      One difference from the last bull run? The current market has gained support from a new wave of institutional investors mainly based in North America.      “You could look at the timing of the rally, which coincided with typical U.S. market open hours,” said John Todaro, director of institutional research at cryptocurrency analysis firm TradeBlock. He added that volumes at LMAX Digital, which primarily caters to institutional traders, are also higher.      Bitcoin’s price broke its previous all-time high earlier Monday, according to CoinDesk’s BPI, setting a new record at $19,850.11.      Read more: Bitcoin Trading Fees on PayPal, Robinhood, Cash App and Coinbase: What to Know      “During the thinly traded Thanksgiving holiday, regulation concerns, which were outlined by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong in a series of tweets, caused the asset to correct, declining to around $16,500 – during a time when a large number of U.S. institutional investors and traders were not actively transacting,” Todaro said. “Today, Monday morning, you had a large return of institutional traders who bid up the asset, buying the dip.”      To be sure, not all the data for the world’s oldest cryptocurrency is bullish for the near term. Bitcoin’s inflow to exchanges has exceeded outflows since the Thanksgiving sell-off, according to data provider CryptoQuant.      That on-chain metric could indicate a short-term bearish trend, sending bitcoin back to a level of around $16,000, said Ki Yong Ju, chief executive officer of CryptoQuant. That’s because it means large bitcoin buyers, or whales, seem to be active on exchanges, adding more selling pressure.      Nonetheless, the activity is another sign this market isn’t what it was three years ago. After hitting its former record in December 2017, bitcoin’s price quickly dropped to as low as $5,947.40 in just about two months. At the time, the market widely attributed bitcoin’s rally to an increase in active retail investors.    Who's buying    Until very recently, the term “institutional investors” in the crypto world meant an assortment of crypto quant firms, bitcoin miners and early investors. The composition of market participants has gradually changed this year to include a new group considered institutional investors by the traditional financial world, according to Denis Vinokourov, head of research at digital asset prime broker Bequant.      Ongoing capital inflows into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and other exchange-traded products (ETPs) issuers, including 21Shares and CoinShares, are evidence the institutions in traditional financial markets are pouring money into bitcoin, Vinokourov said.

42385204,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAni3J,1606763405,5 Reasons Why Bitcoin Just Hit an All-Time High Price,"Bitcoin surged Monday to a new all-time high price of $19,864, extending its year-to-date rise to an astounding 170% during a 2020 that has seen tumultuous swings in global markets.      Here are five reasons why the oldest and largest cryptocurrency has pushed to new highs.    Institutional interest    Some institutional investors are taking on bitcoin exposure, such as buying into the publicly traded Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), according to a Nov. 20 report from analysts at JPMorgan Chase. (Note: Grayscale is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which owns CoinDesk.) Guggenheim, a money manager that oversees $233 billion for investors, said in regulatory filings its Macro Opportunities Fund might allocate up to 10% of net assets to GBTC, CoinDesk reported Nov. 28. As well, the outstanding number of bitcoin futures contracts is surging on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, seen as another sign that big investors are using commodities markets to speculate on the cryptocurrency’s price, according to the JPMorgan report.    Hedge fund managers have a long view    Well-known hedge fund managers are increasingly calling bitcoin a long-term investment. Legendary managers, including Paul Tudor Jones II and Stanley Druckenmiller, have recently said the cryptocurrency’s price, as denominated in U.S. dollars, could rise as the Federal Reserve prints money to help finance the government’s coronavirus-related emergency stimulus bills. The central bank has thus far created more than $3 trillion of new money in 2020, or more than three quarters of the entire amount created during its prior 107-year history.    Analysts are positive    Wall Street analysts have made positive comments over the past few days. AllianceBernstein, a $631 billion money manager, published a report saying the post-pandemic economic environment could create a role for bitcoin in investors’ asset allocation, CoinDesk reported Monday. Inigo Fraser Jenkins, co-head of the portfolio strategy team at Bernstein Research, wrote that when it comes to a role in hedging against inflation, “the driver of bitcoin is similar to that as for gold.”    The PayPal effect    PayPal (PYPL) is allowing customers – some 346 million active accounts – to buy bitcoin. The person-to-person payments network announced Oct. 21 it would let customers buy, sell and hold bitcoin. According to the company, the cryptocurrency will become a “funding source for purchases at its 26 million merchants worldwide.”    Ok on OKEx    The bitcoin market last week overcame a major source of concern – bitcoin outflows from one of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, OKEx. Some traders and analysts had speculated the end of a five-week suspension of withdrawals might translate into liquidations that could put selling pressure on the bitcoin market. Data extracted from the cryptocurrency’s underlying blockchain network showed some 24,631 bitcoin, worth $500 million at current prices, flowed out of the exchange in the 24 hours after the suspension was lifted last week.      But bitcoin's price action shows the market shrugged off the news, along with other negative developments, such as rumors the U.S. Treasury Department might be considering onerous cryptocurrency regulations. Traders also appeared to ignore data showing some large bitcoin traders – known as “whales” – might be preparing to dump their holdings in response to the cryptocurrency's price rise.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/30/5-reasons-why-bitcoin-just-hit-an-all-time-high-price,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ef12993689df11bfe6757b479a373dae8d731088-1300x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The payments giant has come out with an attractively priced offering for retail buyers. It has a very low fee of $0.50 for starter purchases under $25.00. Its highest fees are 2.3% on purchases from $25.00 to $100, with fees falling in increments from there in two additional tranches until it reaches its lowest rate of 1.5% for purchases above $1,000.      The caveat here is that bitcoin purchases in PayPal live firmly inside the fintech giant’s walled garden. You can cash out to dollars when the time is right, but the actual bitcoin is never yours to keep.      Read more: PayPal Removes Waitlist for New Crypto Service, Boosts Weekly Purchase Limit to $20K    Robinhood    Robinhood is the investing app that has always made trades of all kinds free. This is also true for cryptocurrency purchases.      Robinhood also puts limit orders on all buys and sells so they don't execute if the market moves against the customer suddenly after an order is placed.      Robinhood rolled out BTC in 2018 and has promised withdrawals were coming, but it still hasn't happened. As with PayPal, if a user's holdings become meaningful he or she will just have to trust the company to keep the assets safe.      Read more: Robinhood Traders, Including Bitcoin Holders, Left in the Lurch Following Theft: Report    Coinbase    The downside of Coinbase on this list is it is only a cryptocurrency app so, unlike Robinhood and PayPal, Coinbase is not something users will just have already if they haven't gotten into the industry.      That said, Coinbase made its name making buying and selling cryptocurrency easy, and it's still an app that many tech-savvy retail buyers who haven't yet taken the crypto plunge are likely to know.      Coinbase's fee structure is clearly laid out, starting at $0.99 for purchases below $10 and rising to 1.49% for any purchases above $200.      That said, buyers should also note that it adds a 0.5% spread to all purchases and sales, which means users are always buying a tiny bit over the market price and selling a tiny bit under.      Read more: Coinbase Has Raked in $14B in New Institutional Assets Since April    Cash App    Square's (SQ) Cash App allows people to easily send money to each other, but it has also become a way to buy stocks, pay small businesses and also to buy bitcoin. In fact, Square's Cash App led the way to bringing bitcoin purchases into a mainstream wallet.      The company changed its fee structure for bitcoin purchases and sales last year though, according to the company, the change really only made costs more transparent rather than more expensive.      Cash App doesn't spell out its explicit fees, despite having a bitcoin fees page where it acknowledges both a trading fee and an occasional bump when the price is very volatile. CoinDesk has reached out to Square for a precise structure and will update if we hear back. (When we previously looked, Coinbase started to outperform Cash App for bitcoin purchases around $200 and higher.)      A lot of BTC gets bought and sold on Cash App, but profits on those sales do not represent a meaningful portion of income for Square.      Read more: Square’s Cash App Now Charging Fees for Bitcoin Purchases    Word to the wise    It's important to note there are other factors to take into consideration for buyers who think they might want to get serious about cryptocurrency investing.      For example, users who want to control their own assets will want to use an app that lets them withdraw bitcoin, which not all of these do.      For new entrants to the space, you will soon come across an adage: DYOR (do your own research). Anyone serious about crypto takes responsibility for double-checking third-party recommendations, and the information above is no exception.      That said, for anyone who just wants to drop in (say) $100 and see what happens, any of these apps will serve the purpose well and more are sure to come.

In the piece, Lagarde makes a bullish case for a digital euro while throwing shade at potential rivals such as cryptocurrencies and stablecoins – digital assets the values of which are pegged to fiat currencies.      Lagarde said the main risk of cryptocurrencies is a feature that crypto proponents consider a plus, namely that cryptos rely purely on technology and that there is no identifiable issuer or claim. As a result, Lagarde said, cryptocurrencies suffer from a lack of liquidity, stability and trust, and therefore ""do not fulfil all the functions of money.""      While noting stablecoins are trying to fix those issues and could drive added innovation in payments, they ""pose serious risks,"" Lagarde said.      ""Using stablecoins as a store of value could trigger a large shift of bank deposits to stablecoins, which may have an impact on banks' operations and the transmission of monetary policy,"" the ECB head added.      Lagarde also said that if a stablecoin issuer can't guarantee a fixed value or is viewed as not being able to absorb losses, it could trigger a run.

42385214,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAniDN,1606759434,US Justice Department Extradites Alleged Co-Founder of Crypto Ponzi Scheme From Panama,"The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has extradited the man accused of being one of the co-founders of the global cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme AirBit Club.      The Acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Audrey Strauss, said Monday the accused, Gutemberg Dos Santos, was extradited from Panama last week. Along with co-defendants he has been indicted on charges related to his alleged role in an international fraud and money laundering scheme that defrauding individuals by soliciting investments in an allegedly fake cryptocurrency mining and trading company.      Describing the scheme, Strauss said the company “promised extraordinary rates of return on phantom investments in cryptocurrencies, defrauding victims of tens of millions of dollars.”      According to the indictment, Dos Santos and his co-defendants had been involved in the Ponzi scheme since at least September 2015. Major movements in cryptocurrencies, especially bitcoin (BTC), which on Monday hit an all-time high, provides opportunities for unscrupulous actors to deceive people with promises of consistent and high returns.      Investors, as usual, need to be careful and attentive to such red flags as long delays in processing withdrawals, demand for cash payments and high, hidden fees, all of which often point to fraudulent intentions. In this case, the DOJ said, when one victim tried to withdraw funds from the alleged scheme, she was told to “bring new blood” into AirBit Club in order to receive her returns.    According to the DOJ announcement, the accused and others allegedly promoted the scheme through asking victims to purchase memberships, payments for which were laundered through domestic and foreign bank accounts.  Through these memberships, the defendants allegedly laundered at least $20 million.

The quasi-fork, called Basis Cash, is a dollar-pegged stablecoin project designed for DeFi and commercial applications, a Basis developer said. Beginning with just 50,000 BAC (the token’s ticker) at first, Basis is in a minority of stablecoins that are not backed by anything of value. Instead, price stability will be maintained by the algorithmic printing of Basis Bonds and currency debasing. (The original Basecoin was foiled by U.S. securities regulators, and the team returned the raised funds in 2018.)      Hedge fun... Guggenheim Funds Trust filed an amendment with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to allow its flagship $5 billion Macro Opportunities Fund gain exposure to bitcoin by investing up to 10% of the fund’s net asset value in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Guggenheim is a hedge fund giant with more than $233 billion in total assets. If it follows through on its investment, Guggenheim will join hedge fund managers Stanley Druckenmiller's and Paul Tudor Jones’s recent excursion into crypto, who both noted bitcoin’s strength as an inflation hedge.      Security upgrade Ethereum Classic hard forked to its Thanos upgrade, meant to increase miner participation and increase security. The upgrade allows less powerful mining rigs to join the network, while also doubling the duration of ETC’s mining period, thereby “increasing network security and promoting a more distributed and healthy mining ecosystem,” Terry Culver, CEO at ETCLab, said. More than 90% of existing miners have migrated over to the Thanos fork, according to Culver. Further, as new miners have come online, the network’s hashrate has also seen a notable rise. Over the past year Ethereum Classic has suffered a number of 51% attacks.      Crypto crime Cybersecurity specialist Kaspersky foresees a rise in bitcoin scams in 2021, according to a new report on coming financial threats. Weakening fiat systems and rising poverty caused by the coronavirus pandemic will drive many to cybercrime. Specifically, researchers say, bitcoin fraud and theft is likely to increase, as it is “the most widespread cryptocurrency.” The report extrapolates on available data from this year. Further, targeted ransomware attacks are also expected to rise, having seen “successful operations and extensive media coverage this year,” though Kaspersky thinks ransomers will begin demanding more payouts in privacy-preserving cryptos like monero.

Ripple acquired Moneygram stock in 2019 at $4.10 apiece.

(The Block)  Market intel    Boot and rally Despite the sharp pullback last week, bitcoin looks on track to post its highest-ever monthly price close. Last Wednesday bitcoin quickly shed $3,000 from local highs, but has since recovered more than 50% to approximately $18,600. That’s significantly higher from the peak month-end price of around $13,880 observed on Dec. 31, 2017, CoinDesk markets reporter Omkar Godbole writes. “Every time bitcoin has closed above the previous monthly all-time high, a 700% to 1,000% uptrend has followed,” crypto analyst Josh Rager said.    At stake    CBDC pilots Yesterday I reported that the central banks of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) published a report based on a year-long joint digital currency pilot. In the report the regional powerhouses found that distributed ledgers, including classic blockchains, could improve cross-border and domestic settlements, without sacrificing privacy.      But the “Aber” project, named for the Arabic word for “crossing boundaries,” was significant for more than just a successful central bank digital currency (CBDC) dry run. According to the researchers, it was likely the first blockchain-based CBDC experiment that tested the feasibility of a dual-issued currency.      In this sense, even though a Saudi/UAE bilateral currency is nowhere near ready for deployment, if ever, Aber did add to the existing body of knowledge. The program – which also involved the cooperation of six commercial banks that risked their own deposits in the trial – specifically referenced previous CBDC pilots in Singapore, Japan, South Africa and Canada.      It’s worth going over what those earlier experiments were seeking:    Project Stella: A project began in 2016 and led by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and European central bank (ECB) studied the use of DLT for financial market infrastructure.  Project Ubin: In late 2016, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) commenced a collaborative project with financial institutions and technology providers to explore the use of distributed ledgers for clearing and settlement of payments and securities.  Jasper-Ubin: the Bank of Canada (BoC) and Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) collaborated on Jasper-Ubin Project to test the use of distributed ledger technology for cross-border high value payments.  Project Khokha: In late 2017, the South African Reserve Bank collaborated with seven banks to study interbank settlement in the country.    “While other central banks have also explored cross-border payments, the major difference was in Aber’s dually issued single digital currency approach and use of real money,” Aber’s researchers write.      Accordingly, while most blockchain-based CBDC pilots found varying levels of success in distributed systems to structure a nation’s financial architecture, the research isn’t complete.      Aber, for one, saw early issues in coordinating nodes across jurisdictions as well as lingering questions around transaction privacy, particularly in cross-border transfers. Then there are the issues that any blockchain system will run into including scalability, transaction finality and throughput limit. Those are mostly technical concerns.      Economically speaking, as a joint currency backed equally by the Saudi Riyal and the UAE Dirham initiative, fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates became an issue. As did the possibility of different cities and jurisdictions applying different taxes or charging different interest rates.      While many nations are surging ahead with CBDC adoption – with China and the Bahamas leading the pack – there’s still reason to take a slow-going approach. After all, Aber, modest as it was, was among the first to put real money at stake.

In a research note produced for clients, seen by CoinDesk, Inigo Fraser-Jenkins, co-head of the portfolio strategy team at Bernstein Research, said the firm had previously ruled out bitcoin as an investment asset back in January of 2018, soon after bitcoin had hit its all-time high close to $20,000.      But post-pandemic changes to the policy environment, debt levels and diversification options for investors mean the asset manger now has ""to admit [bitcoin] does"" have a role in asset allocation, at least over the long term.      Fraser-Jenkins said the ""significant reduction"" in the volatility of bitcoin's price makes it more attractive both as a store of value and as a medium of exchange. The pandemic has also seen a rise in bitcoin's correlation with other major assets. On the other hand, he said, bitcoin is a liquid asset and can be quickly sold off, as happened during the March markets crash.      ""From a narrow empirical point of view the downward shift in [volatility] of bitcoin makes it more desirable but its increased correlation points the other way,"" Fraser-Jenkins wrote.      When it comes to a role in hedging against inflation, ""the driver of bitcoin is similar to that as for gold,"" per the note, even if the cryptocurrency may not ""exactly move in a way that would counteract inflation in a given fiat currency.""      Other issues such as use of cryptocurrency in crime and bitcoin mining's heavy energy footprint were cited as concerns around the asset, as was increasing regulatory scrutiny.      There may be potentials issue for bitcoin in future too, according Fraser-Jenkins. With the pandemic likely to make governments more powerful and take a bigger role in managing economies, if cryptocurrencies become much larger than today they may become ""an annoyance for policymakers.""      ""Cryptos do have a place in asset allocation ... for as long as they are legal!"" he said.      Ultimately, Bernstein Research recommends that bitcoin can comprise from 1.5% to 10% of portfolios, depending on the cryptocurrency's monthly returns.      ""The resulting allocation to bitcoin is low, but then within this simple optimization framework the allocation to some other asset classes is zero, so in that context bitcoin seems to empirically be potentially significant,"" Fraser-Jenkins said.

Long-time bitcoin investors have weathered more than one bearish market cycle. But for newer participants, the record highs represent validation of their investment as the cryptocurrency continues to demonstrate resilience.      “The significance of a new all-time high in dollar terms can’t be understated,” said Kevin Kelly, co-founder of Delphi Digital and former equity analyst at Bloomberg, in a direct message with CoinDesk. “Many skeptics have publicly denounced bitcoin for failing to reach a new high despite such a favorable macro backdrop so this is yet another testament to bitcoin’s staying power.”      That favorable backdrop includes, in part, an unprecedented era of spending on the part of central banks around the world to help combat the pandemic-induced economic slowdown. Many bitcoin investors view the digital asset as a hedge against potential inflation from this loose monetary policy.      Year to date, bitcoin has gained 167%. Since its yearly lows in March, after crashing more than 50% in a single day, bitcoin has rallied more than 400%.      To be sure, bitcoin’s positive correlation to traditional markets remains somewhat strong above 0.4, according to Coin Metrics, in contrast to a longstanding narrative supported by bitcoin investors that bitcoin is uncorrelated to traditional markets. With regular exchange outages and new investors questioning the reliability of widely circulated market data, moreover, the adolescent market has room to mature.      Nevertheless, cryptocurrency analysts depict the ongoing rally as healthy and primed to continue as institutional and retail money steadily flows into bitcoin.  Mainstream payment companies like Square and PayPal, for example, continue funneling retail capital into bitcoin.      For Q3, Square reported a record $1 billion in bitcoin revenue via its CashApp mobile wallet. PayPal, after announcing its plan to support bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in October, promptly removed its waitlist for the service less than a month later, citing overwhelming demand.      Institutional demand is also surging, represented in part by record growth in CME Group’s bitcoin futures market, as CoinDesk has reported. Led by high-profile investors like Stanley Druckenmiller, Bill Miller, Paul Tudor Jones and BlackRock’s Rick Rieder, the mainstream financial audience’s thinking about bitcoin is warming significantly as they allocate more and more capital to the leading digital asset.      From a fundamental perspective, the case for a sustained bitcoin rally is as strong as ever, according to Karim Helmy, data analyst at Coin Metrics. The total number of active bitcoin addresses has soared to all-time highs, and the network’s economic density—the value transacted per byte—is nearing levels not seen since the last bull run, he told CoinDesk in a direct message.      Despite tens of thousands of other cryptocurrencies competing for investor mindshare, bitcoin is leaving nearly every one of them behind, with most “altcoins” still down double-digit percentages from their own record highs. Ether is still down 58% from its all-time high, also set in late 2017. Litecoin and XRP are down 77% and 82% from their respective highs.      Bitcoin’s record high comes amidst a curious lack of publicity, however, from mainstream audiences and media outlets, according to data from The Tie.      The total volume of bitcoin-related tweets, for example, is well below late 2017 levels and largely flat for the past two years. Media mentions also are sitting at conspicuously low levels. Search interest in bitcoin, moreover, sits at less than one fifth the level seen at bitcoin’s 2017 high, according to Google Trends.      “I don’t think many people outside the industry cared until we hit all-time highs,” said Ryan Watkins, bitcoin analyst at Messari, in a direct message with CoinDesk. The coronavirus pandemic and U.S. presidential election have dominated mainstream audiences’ attention in 2020, he noted.      As investors look for more upside, any continuation of bitcoin’s rally will be “defined by a wider investor base as new market participants are unlocked,” Kelly said.",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/30/bitcoin-price-sets-new-record-high-of-19850,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0208435770eb7f462d5402adfd781d08a8853bb1-1200x854.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405501,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMeEZ,1606747295,First Mover: You Call That a Record? Bitcoin's November Gains Are 3x Stock Market's,"Bitcoin was higher, appearing to mount a fresh run toward the all-time high near $20,000. The largest cryptocurrency slid 1.3% in the seven days through Sunday, snapping a seven-week winning streak.      As November draws to a close, bitcoin is up 37% just this month, its best performance since May 2019.      ""Even if the market has some froth, bitcoin fundamentals look sound,"" the blockchain research firm Chainalysis wrote in a report.      In traditional markets, European shares were steady and U.S. stock futures pointed to a lower open as investors turned cautious after big gains over the past few weeks boosted coronavirus-vaccine developments.    Market moves    From a broad 2020 perspective, it's hardly news bitcoin in November once again outperformed the world's major asset classes.      During a month when a closely tracked gauge of global equities, the MSCI World Index, surged 13% for its best performance on record, bitcoin jumped nearly three times as fast.      But that's been happening a lot recently, with the cryptocurrency up an astounding 163% so far in 2020, or roughly 13 times the 13% year-to-date gains for U.S. stocks. Gold is up 17% in 2020.      Yet, in hindsight, November may prove to be a crucial month for bitcoin for a few key reasons.      First, in a theme that First Mover has repeatedly hammered this year, many large institutional investors are herd followers, driven by backward-looking performance track records, and they often just ape other investors who have previously performed well. The latest announcement of institutional adoption – perhaps the buzziest of buzzwords these days among cryptocurrency analysts – arrived over the weekend from the $233 billion investment firm Guggenheim. November's outperformance, coupled with a raft of breathless headlines in traditional financial media trumpeting bitcoin approach toward record highs, is likely to entice even more big investors. Even platinum, which is suddenly in vogue because of its potential demand from clean-energy technologies, is up just 14% in November.      Second, bitcoin has brushed off a few market incidents that, in other years, might have sparked a steep sell-off. There were the massive outflows from one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, OKEx, after the lifting of a protracted suspension on withdrawals. There was the news that the U.S. Treasury Department might be considering new onerous cryptocurrency regulations during President Donald Trump's final months in office. There were data showing that big cryptocurrency investors known as ""whales"" might be moving their bitcoin onto exchanges, preparing to take profits – and potentially swamping the market. Sure, bitcoin flinched last week. But for a market that's given so much this year, it took back very little.      Third, the key 2020 investment narrative for bitcoin – that the cryptocurrency can serve as a hedge against inflation and trillion-dollar stimulus packages from governments and central banks, similar to gold – doesn't seem to be going anywhere. President-elect Joe Biden says he'll nominate former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen to become Treasury Secretary, and as a private-sector commentator she's advocated for more government stimulus. But with U.S. lawmakers potentially gridlocked, the Fed may have to keep buying government bonds to stimulate markets; U.S. Treasury-bond yields have stayed close to historic lows, on speculation that this is likely the case.      Bitcoin has had a very good year. In hindsight, November may turn out to be its most crucial month.      - Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin looks set to post its highest-ever monthly price close.      The cryptocurrency is currently trading around $18,600 on major exchanges. That’s significantly higher from the peak month-end price of around $13,880 observed on Dec. 31, 2017.      The impending record close could be a harbinger of a stronger bull run, according to some observers. “Every time bitcoin has closed above the previous monthly all-time high, a 700% to 1,000% uptrend has followed,” crypto analyst Josh Rager tweeted earlier in the month.      Bitcoin jumped nearly 27% in April 2017, toppling the previous monthly close record of around $1,150 reached in November 2013. What followed was a steep rally to nearly $20,000 by December 2017. Strong rallies were seen after bitcoin set record monthly closing prices in January and October 2013.      The recent seven-week-long rally started around $10,000, and prices climbed as high as $19,400 before last week's correction. The much-anticipated break above $20,000 may take some time, since signs of uptrend fatigue have now emerged on the weekly chart. The cryptocurrency carved out a large Doji candle last week, indicating indecision or buyer exhaustion after a notable rally. As such, a deeper pullback to levels below Thursday's low of $16,242 cannot be ruled out.      “The previous froth in momentum traders’ positioning has been cleared to a large extent,” analysts at JPMorgan said in a Nov. 27 note, while adding momentum signals will continue to deteriorate unless bitcoin recovers quickly and momentum traders have room to further propagate the decline.      The No. 1 cryptocurrency by market value fell by over $3,000 to $16,242 on Nov. 26, clearing out excess leverage from the derivatives market. The dip was short-lived and prices have recovered more than 50% of the pullback in the days since.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Despite 12% Crash, Bitcoin Looks Set to Make Highest Monthly Close Ever    What's hot  Basis Cash launch brings defunct stablecoin into DeFi era (CoinDesk)  DeFi protcol YearnFinance merges with market coverage provider Cover (CoinDesk)  Industry pros weigh in on rumors that U.S. Treasury department might be considering new regulations for self-hosted wallets (CoinDesk)  Ripple is cashing out a third of stake in surging MoneyGram (CoinDesk)  Timestamps on previously unpublished emails from Satoshi Nakamoto spark fresh debate on Bitcoin inventor's whereabouts (CoinDesk)  Facebook-backed Libra targets January for launch of dollar-pegged stablecoin (Financial Times)  Guggenheim fund proposes in filing to invest up to $500M in bitcoin through Grayscale trust (CoinDesk) (NOTE: Grayscale is a unit of CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group)  Bilateral Saudi, UAE digital currency experiment shows benefits of distributed ledgers, central banks say (CoinDesk)  Curve Finance votes to distribute nearly $3M in accrued fees to holders of CRV governance tokens (CoinDesk)  Russian bankers tell central-bank official they would gladly serve as intermediaries for a digital ruble, but fear a scenario where the Bank of Russia provides direct individual accounts could spark bank runs (CoinDesk)  New York Times reveals claims of ""racist or discriminatory"" treatment of employees at cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (CoinDesk)  Analogs  The latest on the economy and traditional finance  The world is bingeing on debt, and smashing records, with $9.7T issued in 2020 by companies and governments (WSJ)  Black Friday was bust for many stores, better for online (WSJ)  U.S. Congress confronts deadlines on spending, stimulus and Shelton (Bloomberg)  China expands programs allowing residents to buy overseas stocks, as yuan gains in global foreign-exchange markets (South China Morning Post)  Investors pile into risky ETFs during wild market rally (WSJ)  U.S. economic downturn is hitting state and local government budgets, and 2021 could be worse (WSJ)  From San Francisco to Washington, public transit agencies are slashing services, staff as coronavirus (and remote working) keeps ridership low (WSJ)  The CEO of Tokyo's stock exchange is set to resign after an outage in October saw platform go offline for entire day (Reuters)  JPMorgan wants to tap growth from Asia’s second-largest wealth market by doubling the number of private bankers serving Chinese clients from Singapore over two years (Bloomberg)  Measures of Chinese economic activity signal widening recovery (WSJ)  Tweet of the day",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole, Sebastian Sinclair",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/30/first-mover-you-call-that-a-record-bitcoins-november-gains-are-3x-stock-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/63be413a996e18fceac29430492e91e5b795d978-1920x1271.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a report on financial threats for 2021, based on data and patterns from this year the company said Monday that attacks aimed at stealing bitcoin will ""become more attractive as many nations plummet into poverty as a result of the pandemic.""      The compounding factor of weakening local currencies amid the crisis will also drive people to cybercrime, leading to more bitcoin fraud as well as theft, the firm predicted. It said the focus would be on bitcoin because it is ""the most widespread cryptocurrency.""      In a change of tactic, Kaspersky also sees online criminals moving away from bitcoin when demanding ransoms or payments from victims. The use of ""transition currencies"" with privacy-enhancing features, such as monero, will see greater use as a way to hide criminals' tracks, the firm said, and will be later converted to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.      This shift is being driven governments' improved crypto sleuthing capabilities when it comes to monitoring, deanonymizing and seizing crypto accounts, per the report. The firm cites the recent seizure of funds worth over $1 billion by the U.S. Justice Department from a Silk Road-linked account.      See also: Hackers, Scammers Have Stolen $7.6B in Crypto Since 2011      Targeted ransomware attacks, which generally demand payment in cryptocurrency, are also expected to rise, having seen ""successful operations and extensive media coverage this year.""

42405497,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMeAd,1606734734,"Bitcoin Surges to $19.6K, Looks Set to Make Highest Monthly Close Ever","Bitcoin is surging and looks on track to post its highest-ever monthly price close.      At press time, bitcoin is trading around $19,600 on major exchanges, up 7.9% on the day. The price is significantly higher than the peak month-end level around $13,880 on Dec. 31, 2017.      The No. 1 cryptocurrency by market value fell by over $3,000 on a single day last week to as low as $16,242, clearing out excess leverage from the derivatives market. The dip was short-lived and prices have recovered more than 50% of the pullback in the days since.      The impending record close could be a harbinger of a stronger bull run, according to some observers. ""Every time bitcoin has closed above the previous monthly all-time high, a 700% to 1000% uptrend has followed,"" crypto analyst Josh Rager tweeted earlier in the month. Market analyst Lark Davis shared a similar view on Monday.      Bitcoin jumped nearly 27% in April 2017, toppling the previous monthly close record of around $1,150 reached in November 2013. What followed was a steep rally to nearly $20,000 by December 2017. Strong rallies were seen after bitcoin set record monthly closing prices in January and October 2013.    History to repeat itself?    Analysts are optimistic about the ongoing bull market's longevity, with some pointing to $36,000 as the level to watch once the immediate psychological resistance at $20,000 is scaled.      Factors considered responsible for the recent eight-week rally from $10,000 to $19,400, such as increased institutional participation, hedging demand due to dollar sell-off, a potential rise in inflation and the search for yield alongside a record global stockpile of negative-yielding debt, are expected to continue powering gains in the cryptocurrency.

""There's plenty more to join, of course, and the amount of funds along with the immutable scarcity of bitcoin will be felt in a very strong way.""      According to JPMorgan's analysts, further gains hinge mainly on continued institutional participation. If flows into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust wane, the cryptocurrency could suffer if momentum traders keep backing away, analysts wrote in a Nov. 27 note, adding that decreased flows would weaken the argument that institutions are beginning to prefer bitcoin over gold as a long-term investment. Grayscale is part of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company.      Bitcoin has outperformed gold by leaps and bounds this year.

42405491,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMe4j,1606730110,"Ethereum Classic Activates Thanos Upgrade, Increasing Access for GPU Miners","Ethereum Classic has undergone a hard fork that ushers in a new upgrade aimed to increase miner participation and increase security.      According to the ETC explorer by Blockscout, at around 3:45 UTC on Sunday, the ETC mainnet reached a block height of 11,700,000, automatically triggering the anticipated Thanos upgrade.      Terry Culver, CEO at ETCLabs, told CoinDesk Thanos is an ""important milestone"" as the network moves to improve support for existing miners and draw in new ones.      Specifically, the Thanos (ECIP-1099) protocol upgrade will bring the size of the DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) file well below 4GB, meaning 3GB and 4GB graphics processing units (GPUs) can once more mine the network.      It also doubled the duration of ETC's mining period, or epoch, from 30,000 to 60,000 blocks, slowing the size increase of the DAG (which grows with every epoch). With the implementation, 4GB GPUs will remain supported for an additional three years, according to an ETC blog post.      The upgrade will allow miners with 3GB and 4GB GPU systems to resume mining ETC, ""ultimately increasing network security and promoting a more distributed and healthy mining ecosystem,"" said Culver.      Before the upgrade, the DAG size was already very close to 4GB, forcing some older GPU mining cards off the network. The Thanos upgrade effectively reduced the DAG size from 3.94GB to 2.47GB, per the post.      Over 90% of existing miners have migrated over to the Thanos fork, according to Culver. Further, as new miners have come online, the network's hashrate has also seen a notable rise.      ETC has seen a number of so-called 51% attacks, and has been endeavoring to put in measures to make the network more resilient. One such initiative called MESS (for Modified Exponential Subjective Scoring) is said to make massive blockchain ""reorganizations"" much more expensive to carry out (although its effectiveness has been questioned).

42405496,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMe9e,1606712463,'Basis Cash' Launch Brings Defunct Stablecoin Into the DeFi Era,"A team of anonymous developers is making what might be called a fork of a project that never launched.      Readers of this post will likely see a strong earnings opportunity here, but please be careful.      Basis Cash is based on the stablecoin Basis (originally known as Basecoin) that had $133 million in funding before U.S. securities regulators stepped in and the team behind it returned everything in late 2018.      For those who want to get in on this new decentralized finance (DeFi) project, the smart contracts opened up early Monday.      Read more: Basis Stablecoin Confirms Shutdown, Blaming ‘Regulatory Constraints’      As an aside, it's not the first Basis-inspired stablecoin to launch. Empty Set came out at the end of August and now has more than $100 million in market capitalization.      ""In the long term, we look forward to seeing Basis Cash be used widely as a base layer primitive such that there is organic demand for the asset in many DeFi and commercial settings,"" one of the two anonymous leaders of the project who goes by ""Rick Sanchez"" told CoinDesk over Telegram.      The two anons are going by the names ""Rick"" and ""Morty,"" like the popular cartoon for adults by Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland.    Basis Cash basics    Like most stablecoins, Basis Cash (BAC) is pegged to the U.S. dollar, so one BAC should be equal to the crypto equivalent of one USD. Basis Cash's price will be managed by two other crypto assets: Basis Bonds and Basis Shares (more on what each does in the next section).      Beginning at the end of November, 50,000 BAC will be distributed over a five-day period (10,000 per day) to folks that deposit any of these five stablecoins into its smart contract: DAI, yCRV, USDT, SUSD and USDC. Depositors can't drop in more than 20,000 stablecoins from any one account. The daily reward will be distributed pro-rata and users can take their coins back out at any time.      Read more: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained      Unlike most other DeFi projects that do some form of liquidity mining like this, that pool of four stablecoins won't be doing anything. Depositors will be liquidity providers into still waters. ""It's admittedly a useless capital exercise,"" Sanchez wrote. ""Think of it as kind of like a Coinbase Earn quiz. Minimum threshold to get free assets.""      After that initial BAC distribution, two Uniswap v2 pools will be spun up. The pairs will be BAC-DAI and BAC-Basis Shares (BAS). A million BAS – all the BAS in existence – will be distributed to those two pools (750,000 to the former pool and 250,000 to the latter).      By far the most generous distribution will be the first 30 days of the BAC-DAI pool. More on that here.      Some very clever attacker might have had a great trick worked out on the original Basis and that attack has just been sitting in a drawer since. So (again) be careful.      Though Basis Cash asks less of users in terms of posting collateral than most other DeFi applications. After those first five days are up, the main place where funds would be at risk would be in the two Uniswap pools.      ""Seigniorage shares–style stablecoins ... are much more susceptible to black swan failure than Maker or Tether – and I am not ruling out the possibility that Basis Cash will de-peg significantly in the early days of the protocol (in fact, I think it's highly likely),"" Sanchez wrote, adding:    ""What we have high conviction on is that 1) the protocol has the ability to recover from most of these failures, and that 2) such failures will become much less frequent and severe over time as new participants enter.""  How it works    So the key takeaway with Basis Cash is this: It is completely unmoored to anything with ""real"" value.      The U.S. dollar, for example, was once backed by gold, but they stopped being redeemable for precious metals long ago. Dollars are actually still backed, but they are backed chiefly by U.S. Treasurys.      Circle's USDC is backed by real dollars in a bank account. While MakerDAO's dai gets minted out of thin air, it's backed by ETH or other crypto assets that have been locked up in a smart contract.      Read more: US Government Enlists USDC for ‘Global Foreign Policy Objective’ in Venezuela: Circle CEO      Basis Cash has nothing tucked away to guarantee its value. Its only guarantee is a purely algorithmic system that should help it find the real demand for BAC in the market such that its price tends to sit at equal to $1.      So, if BAC should drop below a dollar, the system will issue Basis Bonds. Those Basis Bonds can be bought for one BAC. They can also be redeemed for one new BAC when the price is above a dollar.      For example, if BAC were to drop to $0.97, a user could buy a bunch of BAC at that discounted price and redeem them for the bonds (which burn the BAC). That reduces the supply and should bring it back in line with the peg.      Then, when BAC goes over $1.00, new BAC gets issued. The system first lets bondholders redeem them (so if someone bought bonds at $0.97 they should get at least a 3% profit) and the rest of the fresh BAC goes to holders of Basis Cash Shares.      Though to get the new BAC (the seignorage), BAS holders have to stake their shares in the Boardroom, another smart contract.      The obvious part of this system that could be exploitable might be how its oracle system works. The team has not yet responded to questions from CoinDesk about how it will get prices into the system. From the documents it has put out so far, it seems to rely on Uniswap price data, however.    Isn't 50,000 BAC tiny?    The supply of stablecoins hit $20 billion in late September, so 50,000 BAC seems very small.      The initial supply of BAC might be intentionally diminutive. Either way, if it's not enough, the Basis Cash system should adjust when and if that's the case.      Read more: Origin Debuts OUSD, a Stablecoin That Works Like a Savings Account      If it turns out the market demands a lot more BAC once it goes live, then the price should quickly break its dollar peg. If that happens, the smart contracts should swiftly start printing more BAC. Theoretically, this could mean that in the very early days of Basis Cash, returns to its shares could be exceptionally strong at the very beginning.      ""In the short term, given one needs to provide liquidity for Basis Cash against Dai to earn Basis Share tokens, liquidity providers looking to farm Basis Share tokens will buy Basis Cash – farming demand drives initial demand and attendant seigniorage,"" Sanchez wrote.      If the world in fact wants this new stablecoin, the Basis system should find the right supply shortly. But as Sanchez noted above, it's likely to be extremely volatile early on.      CoinDesk asked the leader of the team that launched the original Basis, Nader Al-Naji, what he thought of the stablecoin's resurrection. In an email to CoinDesk, he said he has not dug into it.      ""A lot of people have reached out to me about Basis Cash,"" Al-Naji wrote. ""It seems to be gaining traction among the people who backed me with Basis, given how many people have asked me about it, but I don't know anyone who [has] definitively decided to back the project.""",NEUTRAL,USDC,MARKET | MINING | TRADING | UNI | USDC,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/30/basis-cash-launch-brings-defunct-stablecoin-into-the-defi-era,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/da6a839f2a775e8127d74f0ff346444ba80216fa-1600x1067.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
