42397181,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAacMFe,1372788559,What does the future hold for bitcoin regulation? #BTCLondon,"A panel of bitcoin and legal experts discussed the hot topic of regulation and digital currency today at the Bitcoin London conference.  The panel discussion, which was moderated by Stefan Greiner of Xenion Legal, featured Constance Choi of Payward, Patrick Murck of Bitcoin Foundation, Stuart Hoegner of Gaming Counsel and attorney Danny Friedberg.  Greiner kicked off the discussion by warning members of the audience not to expect any concrete answers about the future of digital currency's regulation – the landscape is currently moving, which is likely to remain the case for a while.  Speaking first about regulation in the US, Murck said the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has been ""making a lot of noise"" about digital currency recently, stating their aim is to ensure the protection of consumers.  He noted California and other states have started to crack down on bitcoin companies recently, even though it is not clear which legislation, if any, the currency falls under. He added that the Bitcoin Foundation has, today, issued its response to the cease and desist order it received recently.  Some bitcoin supporters fear aggressive attempts at regulation, such as the cease and desist orders, will have a negative effect on bitcoin as they will frighten consumers. However, Choi believes the attempts at regulation by the US treasury have merely served to ""propel bitcoin from the shadows"".  She went on to say Payward and the Bitcoin Foundation have been in talks about forming a coalition – a kind of self-regulating organisation – that has, so far, been given the full blessing of the treasury.  Murck said it could be the case that the industry is left having to prove its innocence, rather than regulators having to prove the industry is doing something wrong. He added this would be bad for consumers and bitcoin businesses in the US, but offers those in other countries the opportunity to take the lead in the digital currency industry.  Toronto-based Hoegner said the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) recently published statements relating to digital currencies that, in a nutshell, suggest bitcoin transactions do not fall under current legislation.  He added, however, that he thinks the rules will change in the future: ""There's a window [of no regulation], but I don't know how long this will be open.""  Choi said there seems to be a much more ""reasoned"" approach to regulation in Europe than there is in the US, with Greiner adding the European Central Bank's analysis of bitcoin found it was not e-money, so it does not currently fall under regulation.  The same goes for Australia – bitcoin doesn't currently fall under the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre's laws on e-currency.  Murck said he was ""heartened"" by the amount of conversation that has taken place with regulators across the world – the mere fact they are willing to discuss it at all gives it strength and credibility, he added.  He said now is the time for the bitcoin community to come together and discuss what they could be flexible on and what they simply will not budge on. If willingness to compromise is displayed, governments may be willing to ease back on future regulation.  Murck believes now could also be the time to engage in further talks with the banks: ""You can make your best friends over common enemies.""

42397183,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAacMHc,1372782319,VC panel discusses investment opportunities in bitcoin #BTCLondon,"A panel of investors displayed a certain level of scepticism today when they discussed the arguments for and against investing in Bitcoin companies.  Bloomberg senior reporter Stephanie Baker moderated a panel discussion between Nick Shalek of Ribbit Capital, Stefan Glaenzer of Passion Capital and Michael Jackson of Mangrove Capital this afternoon at the Bitcoin London conference.  When asked why he had not yet invested in any bitcoin companies, Glaenzer confessed he's become a tad lazy over the past two years, since his transition from being an entrepreneur to a VC.  ""As an entrepreneur, you push, but as a VC you sit and wait for people to come to you, and no one has,"" he said.  Jackson agreed, stating that no bitcoin companies have darkened his inbox, either, questioning whether this is simply because the industry is so new. He went on to say one of the biggest problems investors face with bitcoin is proving to funds that an investment in a digital currency company is worthwhile.  ""Funds entrust us with their money because we're going to invest in something innovative, but I have to present a credible case. We need to be sure the money used is being invested in something secure and legal.""  Funds may be sceptical, but Glaenzer admitted there is certainly space for an industry that facilitates easier online payments.  ""The only thing that has become more complicated on the internet is payments. We should focus on delivering great solutions to that problem,"" he said.  Shalek, who has invested in bitcoin itself as well as two bitcoin companies, agreed. He suggested that bitcoin is the answer, but conceded that work needs to be done to simplify it and promote it to the man on the street.  ""Right now, bitcoin is like the internet was in the early days – it's mainly techies and geeks who are interested, but it’s not accessible to the masses.""  The topic of the discussion then turned to regulation, with Shalek suggesting that when new technology comes along, it takes time for regulation to catch up, but catch up it most likely will.  Glaenzer questioned the need for regulation, stating that when money first came into existence, there was no regulation, yet it still survived for centuries. He also highlighted the fact that the grey area created by the lack of specific regulation in some ways makes companies in the bitcoin sphere more attractive to investors.  ""If everything on the regulations side is cleared up, there's no grey area, but if there's no grey area, there's no room for great successes,"" he explained.  Both Glaenzer and Jackson claimed that as the bitcoin industry is currently only worth around $1.6 billion, it's not really on the radar of many investors.  ""From a venture point of view, bitcoin is not significant enough, so that's why interest in it is low,"" said Glaenzer.  This said, neither Glaenzer nor Jackson stated categorically that they would not invest in bitcoin companies in the future. In fact, both expressed interest in investing in the actual currency, which Shalek advised is the ""best starting place"" for investors wanting to test the digital currency waters.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/02/vc-panel-discusses-investment-opportunities-in-bitcoin-btclondon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a83dd7da4df24c97d13cad70be9e8a118f556d5f-1000x610.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424999,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHXOHh,1372781159,Why Iceland should use bitcoin as its national currency #BTCLondon,"The economist Sveinn Valfells has an unusual proposition: Bitcoin should become the Icelandic national currency.  At Bitcoin London 2013, Valfells explained that Iceland is an extremely wealthy nation with a broken financial system, and in desperate need for a new currency.  ""It has far from adjusted from the 2008 crash. It has large overhang of hot money, and bloated and expensive banks. It has also a history of not managing its currency so well"", he explained.  In front of investors and enterpreneurs from all over the world, he argued why he thinks this is possible and, even more, why it would bring benefits for his nation.  ""Bitcoin meets straightforward criteria: it's getting close to the market cap of $1B needed for a comfortable margin and, in the matter of governance, it already has a structure so it's getting there"", he said.  However, Valfells also accepted that bitcoin's volatility needs to be reduced and liquidity should be incremented to secure the exports that Iceland needs.  Despite the boldness of the proposition, Valfells remained optimistic about a potential acceptance of the cryptocurrency among Icelandic people.  ""I've seen private money [like vouchers] displacing public currency, and bitcoin qualifies as an asset"", he said.  The Stanford-educated economist assured the audience that the financial system will rotate into bitcoin in less than two decades.  ""Bitcoin is going to grow like bacteria in a Petri dish, and the Icelandic króna is walking dead"", he said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET,Elizabeth Machuca,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/02/why-iceland-should-use-bitcoin-as-its-national-currency-btclondon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4592479070b02dfbf985664c54d295807e7ce3ad-828x424.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424996,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHXODh,1372777204,"Startup pitches: Lamassu, Bits of Gold, Bex.io, BitPrice and Bits of Proof #BTCLondon","Bitcoin is expanding its market like never before. Today, Bitcoin London showcased bitcoin startups that already exist in places like Argentina, Brazil, Israel and the UAE.  The Israeli company Bits of Gold, which will launch its services this Autumn, plans on making bitcoin accessible throughout Israel, said the CEO, Jonathan Rouach.  ""Outside of the US and the EU, I see opportunity for the expansion of the currency"", he said.  At least four companies launching bitcoin-related services in the next few months attended the 2013 conference in London in the search for investors.  One of them is Lamassu, responsible for developing a bitcoin ATM. Zach Harvey said ""ATMs are already replacing bank branches and retailers can easily switch to bitcoin, or cashless or cardless.""  According to the company, the machine could be launched this August.  Yurii Rashkovskii, from Bex.io, said there are many obstacles for these emerging companies, including banking regulations in their countries and liquidity, as well as competitors like BTC Global and Mt. Gox.  Bex.io is a project aiming to ""help bitcoin business enterpreneurs manage the technical side of the operation so they don't need to worry about it"", he said.  The UK-based project Bitprice, led by Tom Robinson, said that British authorities are not up to date with bitcoin.  ""We have spoken to them and they're still exploring the [cryptocurrencies] space; they want to see how big it is going to become"", he said.  Robinson considers it important as an entrepreneur to avoid jumping in straight away and recommends building projects up slowly and securely in this new industry.  Another one of the novelties of the event was offered by Bits of Proof, led by Tamás Blummer, which plans on developing servers and client-side libraries that bridge the gap between bitcoin applications like Exchange, Merchant, Wallet, Research, and the reference Bitcoin implementation.  “It shortens development and enriches functionality, in contrast to speculative 'investment' into the currency value of bitcoin”, he said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Elizabeth Machuca,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/02/startup-pitches-lamassu-bits-of-gold-bexio-bitprice-and-bits-of-proof-btclondon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f442e8433f3ccdd4c536069704b73d42d9aec6d3-1000x685.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424992,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHXO5h,1372765523,"Coinapult, Bitstamp, LocalBitcoins, Tradehill and Kipochi discuss bitcoin growth #BTCLondon","Some of the rising stars of the bitcoin world that could boost bitcoin adoption in the next few months discussed successes and issues with the community at Bitcoin London today.  ""It's not 16-year-olds in basements anymore. Bitcoin is now aiming at corporations and institutions"", said Nejc Kodric, CEO of Bitstamp.  Pelle Braendgaard, CTO of money transfer company Kipochi (a Swahili word that means 'wallet') informed the audience that bitcoin is becoming increasingly popular in the African countries, with almost 100 transactions involving the cryptocurrency each week.  ""Our customers are largely African families who live abroad and wish to transfer money to their families. Thefore the popularity is largely encouraged by the African diaspora"", he explained.  Braendgaard also announced that his company is testing the SMS method for money wiring in Africa, which will rule out the need for having an internet-connected mobile phone.  ""Even those old Nokia mobile phones will be suitable for it and the information will be sent through SMS. We expect it to be launched in a couple of weeks"", he said.  The panelists highlighted the profile of the new bitcoin holders, that can vary from ""professional miners to people who have had their bank accounts frozen and are looking for alternatives"", said Jared Kenna, CEO of Tradehill.  However, this developing world has several challengues on the way, especially in nations like the US with a ""ridiculous financial regulatory system"", according to Erik Voorhees, from Coinapult.  ""Most of the bitcoin innovation will happen outside of the States, because regulation in that country is a problem even for non-US-based companies, as they are asked to be their own police force"", he said. ""The larger the country is, the harder it is for the currency to be accepted.""  For Kenna, the most difficult part for bitcoin companies is dealing with the institutions within the traditional financial system.  However, others are optimistic about it and have had success in talking their way through the banking system.  ""Establishing a relationship with the banks wasn't hard. I went to the bank and spoke and I was surprised because they already knew what bitcoin is. I would even dare say they might embrace the currency later on"", said Kodric.  The panelists encouraged the London bitcoin community to ""go for it"" despite regulation issues and don't let that hold them back, as bitcoin is here to stay.  ""It's really hard to compete with bitcoin, but if something surpasses the currency it will be because someone came up with something better, but for now it is pretty good"", said Voorhees.

42425002,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHXONh,1372763650,Winklevoss twins file for $20 Million IPO of bitcoin trust fund,"The Winklevoss twins have filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for an investment fund based upon their substantial holding of bitcoin. The Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust is sponsored by a company the pair created called Math-Based Asset Services LLC. The Winklevii (as they are known) hope to expose more investors to the potential gains (and losses) of bitcoin.  The S-1 form can be read in full here. The Winklevii told the New York Times in April that they had a portfolio of (at the time of writing) $11 million worth of bitcoin. That holding reportedly represents 1% of all bitcoin in circulation.  Given the volatility and regulatory uncertainty surrounding bitcoin, it is understandable that many traditional investors have held back from taking a position on bitcoin. However, the Winklevii state in the SEC filing that:  The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the Blended Bitcoin Price of Bitcoins, less the expenses of the Trust’s operations. The Shares are designed for investors seeking a cost-effective and convenient means to gain exposure to Bitcoins with minimal credit risk.  Therefore, the Winklevoss proposition may serve to tempt in more mainstream and conservative investors to put their money into bitcoin. Helping bitcoin to gain acceptance is just what the Winklevoss twins seem to be working on. At the Bitcoin 2013 conference, they called for bitcoin businesses to work with their governments and stated that cooperation was the way forward.  The SEC filing goes on to explain that shares are purchased in blocks of 50,000 – known as ""Baskets"", that will be indivisible.  The Shares may be purchased from the Trust only in one or more blocks of [50,000] Shares (a block of [50,000] Shares is called a Basket). The Trust will issue Shares in Baskets to certain authorized participants (Authorized Participants) on an ongoing basis as described in “Plan of Distribution.” Baskets will be offered continuously at the net asset value (NAV) for [50,000] Shares on the day that an order to create a Basket is accepted by the Trustee. The Trust will not issue fractions of a Basket.  Furthermore,  The Trust will issue Shares from time to time in Baskets, as described in “Creation and Redemption of Shares.” It is expected that the Shares will be sold to the public at varying prices to be determined by reference to, among other considerations, the price of the Bitcoins represented by each Share and the trading price of the Shares on the [EXCHANGE] at the time of each sale.  Later in the filing, the ""Plan of distribution"" explains that it allows ""authorized participants"" to receive Baskets in exchange for bitcoin on a continuous basis. The trust states that it will not issue fractions of Baskets as shares will be created on an ongoing basis. However, such authorized participants are free to sell any fraction of shares to their clients.  For example, a broker-dealer firm or its client will be deemed a statutory underwriter if it purchases a Basket from the Trust, breaks the Basket down into its constituent Shares and sells the Shares directly to its customers, or if it chooses to couple the creation of a new Basket with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for the Shares.  The filing also cautioned that it was not directly responsible fo the development of the Bitcoin network, and that ""the sponsor and its management have no history of operating an investment vehicle like the Trust, their experience may be inadequate or unsuitable to manage the Trust"".

The misappropriation of client assets is rife, interest rates are being manipulated by central banks and savers are being abused, he said.  ""Instead of bailout, the new trend is bail-in,"" Demeester explained, with savers' accounts being raided to prop up failing banks and economies.  Back in May, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch chairman of the Eurozone, told the FT and Reuters that savings accounts in Spain, Italy and other European countries will be used if needed to preserve Europe's single currency.  ""How are problems with traditional currencies going to play out?"", Demeester questioned. ""I don't know and I don't care, because I own bitcoins,"" was his response.  He went on to extol the many virtues of bitcoin, highlighting that it possesses many features central currencies lack, including flexibility, durability and the provision of as much privacy as the users desire.  Demeester described bitcoin as the ""ground floor of a new financial system"" for those who crave a more stable currency and said it and other cryptocurrencies are, without a doubt, here to stay.  When asked by a member of the audience to explain the fall in bitcoin's value over recent months, Demeester said around half of the holders of the 500 largest accounts ""have not budged"" – they are ""in it for the long-haul"" and can see the decrease is only temporary.  The ""weak hands"", however, read negative reports about bitcoin in the press and their confidence in the currency is knocked, so they sell, which has a knock-on effect on the value.  Demeester projected that, over the next six months, there could be a further dip in the value of Bitcoin, providing the opportunity for people to ""buy low"", with prices rising to much higher levels by late 2014.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/02/tuur-demeester-bitcoin-is-the-solution-to-financial-dissatisfaction-btclondon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/53b53579a38fbd2e92e73516e983ca39f192e29e-2560x1510.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

He concluded his introduction to the conference by repeating a phrase voiced in the past by Roger ""Bitcoin Jesus"" Ver: ""Bitcoin is the biggest invention since the internet.""
