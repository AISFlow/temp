And, perhaps more notably, he suggested using a cryptocurrency to do so.  During an interview with NPR's Steve Inskeep, the U.S. lawmaker explained that he has already proposed letting the American public pay for the wall, which is opposed by Democrats but mades up a key aspect of President Donald Trump's list of 2016 campaign promises. In particular, Davidson told Inskeep, he has suggested a private funding program wherein ""the American people, or whomever should choose to donate,"" (including residents of Mexico) would be able to fund the wall's construction.  He went on to add:  ""You could do it with sort of like a crowdfunding site or you could do a blockchain and you could have WallCoins, but you could raise the money and frankly if we get it right at the Treasury you could even pay with Mexican pesos.""  Davidson noted that this funding would not support a full wall across the entire border and that some parts could likely be reinforced with fences.  ""There are areas that you would want to secure with a wall, and if you look at the areas where you have secured them with walls, $5 billion isn't going to build a wall like the Great Wall of China, this is going to build secure fences,"" he said.  Davidson is an outspoken supporter of the cryptocurrency space, having previously held a round-table event with more than 80 representatives from both the crypto and finance industries to discuss possible legislation for initial coin offerings.  A spokesperson for Davidson did not respond to a request for comment by press time.

42402331,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd41sr,1544731202,Binance Is Expanding Its Crypto Incubator to 5 New Cities,"The cryptocurrency exchange Binance is casting a wider net to find the next unicorn startup.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the venture wing of the namesake exchange, Binance Labs, will launch new incubator programs in Berlin, Buenos Aires, Lagos, Singapore and Hong Kong come March 2019.  The company is announcing this global expansion, offering 10-week onsite programs for early-stage blockchain projects, just as the inaugural San Francisco program is set to end on Friday. Starting next year, all Binance Labs incubation programs will conclude together with a three-week trip to Singapore, where the parent company is based, and a collective demo day.  Stepping back, eight teams were selected out of over 500 applicants to each receive $500,000 and participate in the San Francisco incubator this year. Ella Zhang, head of Binance Labs, told CoinDesk the company will also welcome two more batches of applicants to San Francisco in 2019.  Speaking of Latin America and Africa, Zhang added:  “Those two emerging markets have native blockchain and crypto use cases. So we hope to find teams solving local problems like payments, the instability of local currencies, or remittance problems.”  Meanwhile, Zhang expects projects from the Hong Kong program will focus on solutions for the traditional financial sector. Unlike this year, in 2019 the chosen teams will start with closer to $250,000 each and then fly to Singapore to collaborate across the board. The number of teams accepted to each program will be determined by the quality and quantity of applicants. Then, during the Singapore chapter of the incubation program, roughly 10 teams will be selected for a second larger investment.  Zhang said the goal of this program is to foster a community of builders, including high-quality token projects that could get their assets listed on the exchange. In addition, teams will be able to promote their products or services through Binance platforms after graduating from the program. One such project from the inaugural San Francisco class, SafePal, is developing a hardware crypto wallet that would only cost $10.  “Some of our enterprise solutions will have Binance adopt them as clients,” Zhang said, adding projects that boost mainstream adoption could attract new users to Binance. “Also, we’ll push the hardware [SafePal] product to our community and users.”  Product-market fit  The incubation program gives Binance a first crack at emerging technologies in the space, while founders gain access to potential investors and social media promotions. Although finding product-market fit is challenging in this space, it helps to have one of the industry’s most popular companies offering developers direct feedback on their needs and their users’ needs.  “We’ll help them build up the sales and distribution channel,” Zhang said of all the participating projects, including SafePal. “We have the user base. Binance itself has over 10 million users.”  Indeed, Binance’s contacts and user base were one of the main draws that attracted startups to apply for this program. Mentors included Lily Liu, the co-founder of Earn.com, which was acquired by Coinbase; Primitive Ventures co-founder Eric Meltzer; and Trust Wallet founder Viktor Radchenko. Zhang said such mentors have the opportunity to co-invest in startups that graduate from the program.  Robert Yau, founder of Path, a software startup that recently graduated from the Binance Labs program, told CoinDesk the diversity of mentors helped his team create a blockchain-agnostic API solution.  “When I went in we had a tax software [provider] that used the platform. The big feedback was, there are only so many people doing crypto taxes,” Yau said, speaking to how Path now makes data processing software that is compatible with a variety of exchanges and wallets. “Chatting with different mentors and folks is how we came from where we originally were to where we are heading towards.”  Yau said there are now 1,000 people on the waitlist, eager to use Path’s software. Speaking to what she looks for in an application, Zhang said the ability to prove demand like this is crucial. The leading factors for applicants are the founding team’s experience and proven demand for their solution.  “You should have customers, clients, if you’re doing enterprise solutions,” Zhang said. “Only if the users are willing to pay for or are dying to use this feature, that’s product-market fit.”  Binance Labs incubator image from San Francisco via Binance",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | BNB,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/12/13/binance-is-expanding-its-crypto-incubator-to-5-new-cities,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/497af9d9ee368dd685e142d12737a09a712e7b2e-1188x750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402333,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd41vo,1544727620,Gaming PC Maker Razer Offers Store Credit in Return for Crypto Mining,"Gaming hardware manufacturer Razer has launched an app that rewards users for mining cryptocurrency – but not with either cash or crypto.  Announced Wednesday, the app, dubbed Razer SoftMiner, allows gamers to utilize their idle graphics cards to mine for new transactions blocks on the ethereum blockchain, among other networks. While mining directly using software clients or via other apps earns computer owners cryptocurrency, SoftMiner instead rewards them with loyalty points under Razer's Silver program; the amount of ""silver"" they get depends on the processing power of their computers and the amount of time dedicated to running the app, among more technical factors.  The loyalty points can later be redeemed in-store for discounts on Razer products, merchandise, gift vouchers and more, the firm says.  The app has also seen some push-back on social media, with one Twitter user summing up the app concept as: ""Razer SoftMiner uses your GPU to mine cryptocurrency, but you don’t get the coins.""  SoftMiner has been built using the same engine as GammaNow, a similar desktop app that rewards users for handing over their unused GPU processing power.  While the news might seem an easy way for owners of powerful gaming machines to earn some extra cash-equivalent, it comes as miners are struggling to make ends meet with prices down at least 80 percent across many cryptos this year. As a result, single GPU miners are unlikely to make significant earnings even if mining directly via dedicated software.  Last month, Taiwan-based tech giant Asus similarly moved to allow gamers to use their graphics cards to earn a share of profits from cryptocurrency mining. Asus partnered with mining app provider Quantumcloud for the effort and pays users out in cash via PayPal or WeChat.

42402332,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd41up,1544723588,"Basis Stablecoin Confirms Shutdown, Blaming 'Regulatory Constraints'","Basis, the most well-funded stablecoin startup, has confirmed that it is shutting down and returning all of its remaining funds to investors.  The company realized that the regulatory landscape was too unfavorable to launch the project, according to an interview published today in Forbes. The startup's move to return funds to investors was first reported by crypto news site The Block.  Originally called Basecoin, Basis had secured $133 million in funding to build an algorithmic stablecoin. Its founder, Nader Al-Naji, frequently described the project using code to maintain price stability for its token in the same way the U.S. Federal Reserve does for the dollar.  In a blog post today, Al-Naji wrote:  ""As regulatory guidance started to trickle out over time, our lawyers came to a consensus that there would be no way to avoid securities status for bond and share tokens (though Basis would likely be free of this characterization).""  ""We considered many alternative paths to launch to try and comply with the regulatory constraints while keeping our product compelling and competitive, including launching offshore, and starting off with a centralized stability mechanism,"" Al-Naji explained in the post. ""Ultimately, however, we don't think any of the paths we considered are compelling enough for our users or our investors, or consistent enough with our vision to justify moving forward.""  In particular, he noted that its bond and share tokens, used to expand and contract the supply of tokens in order to maintain a price peg, would have to follow rules limiting it to accredited investors and requiring know-your-customer and anti–money laundering checks.  A source with knowledge of the matter told CoinDesk that Basis was bound by the terms of its simple agreement for future tokens (SAFT) and very conservative legal guidance. Unlike typical equity agreements, the SAFT that Basis used left little room for pivoting, and counsel offered little support for other options.  That said, the source pinned the blame on Basis's particular agreements rather than any broad-based condemnation of stablecoins by U.S. regulators. No official communication was ever made by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the source explained. The team came to this conclusion on its own, CoinDesk was told.  Backed by not only some of the biggest names in crypto, Basis found support from some of the biggest names in venture capital. Investors included Andreessen Horowitz, Bain Capital Ventures, Lightspeed Ventures and GV (originally Google Ventures).  Salil Deshpande of Bain Capital Ventures expressed appreciation for the company's decision, telling CoinDesk:  ""At a high level, their bond tokens had to be classified as securities, which meant they’d need to restrict transfers and do accredited investor checks using a centralized whitelisting system. That was totally at odds with the concept of a decentralized independent stablecoin.""  Andreessen Horowitz was not immediately available for comment.  In a report on the stablecoin industry released in September, Blockchain noted that the company had by far the most open positions listed of any of the leading stablecoin projects, showing 22 in that report.  Hiring plans at Basis were fueled by its generous funding. At the time, the company took credit for bringing new institutions into a vision of decentralized finance.  “I think we were able to convert a lot of institutions into understanding the full scope of crypto more broadly,” Al-Naji told CoinDesk at the time.  In an announcement on the company website, Al-Naji wrote today:  ""Although this isn't the outcome any of us wanted, we knew going into this that we were fundamentally making a binary bet on a favorable regulatory landscape.""

42402338,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd420j,1544720328,STO Services Startup TokenSoft Acquires Stake in Regulated Broker-Dealer,"STO technology platform TokenSoft is launching a regulated broker-dealer as part of its push to offer greater services to token issuers and startups.  The firm – which is known for assisting startups with token sale launches – announced the new regulated broker-dealer affiliate, called TokenSoft Global Markets, on Thursday. The new entity is registered through the the New York office of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).  With the regulated affiliate TokenSoft can now advise token issuers across every step of an initial coin offering. In particular, said co-founder Mason Borda, having a broker-dealer license grants the company the ability to provide services that the original technology firm could not, primarily revolving around issuance and management.  Prior to acquiring the license, TokenSoft's customers would have had to coordinate with another firm or determine the appropriate steps themselves for some of the process.  To bring about the move, said Borda, the firm bought a 20 percent stake in a regulated broker-dealer called Marpine Securities LLC, which has now rebranded to the new affiliate. The companies will remain as two distinct entities with separate leadership teams, however.  Initially, the company plans to provide referral services to custody providers or exchanges, meaning the firm will help token issuers set up accounts and services with the providers.  TokenSoft Global Markets will be able to manage ICOs on issuers' behalf as well, with the company providing support for each stage of the process, on top of its existing compliance platform. The company will also provide marketing support.  Other services will also be offered going forward, though there are no firm plans yet, according to Borda.  ""We've been evaluating what sorts of business opportunities ... we can have under TokenSoft Global Markets,"" he said, adding:  ""TokenSoft brings a lot of technological expertise that’s not on the market right now, when it comes to security … when it comes to compliance. These are technological solutions that we’ve been able to build because we started very fast. We started on the right regulatory footing.""  While TokenSoft Global Markets has had its regulatory approval since late October, it's spent the last few months building up the platform.  ""There's a lot of coordination that comes around getting into this process, there's regulatory concerns we need to do diligence on ... it's mainly around the management of the regulatory [side] we've been spending a lot of time on,"" he explained.

A Kakao representative told CoinDesk that its investment arm had joined the funding effort because it ""always seeks to invest and support innovative startups and Orbs is a good example.""  The startup raised 139,000 ether ($12,371,000) and 892 bitcoin ($3,017,026), which amounts to about $15.4 million as of press time.  Orbs is building a public blockchain that it describes itself as a ""universal"" and ""scalable"" second layer for decentralized applications with ""the liquidity of a base layer.""  With the fundraising effort now completed, Orbs will now invest further in research, as well as continuing to develop its core technology, said Orbs president and co-founder Daniel Peled.

The mainnet is scheduled to go live in April 2019.  According to a blog post from Orbs, the investment is an extension of its existing partnership with Kakao's blockchain subsidiary Ground X, that see the two companies partnering on blockchain applications and R&D projects.  Orbs has been running its fundraiser over the past year, converting some of the cryptocurrency raised into fiat along the way to avoid the market decline since January.

In his seven years at Apple, Shoemaker worked as a senior director for App Store Review division, where he built the team from four to over 300 members.

42402309,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd40SJ,1544706024,Blockstack Won’t Need to Sell Bitcoin or Ether to Survive Crypto Winter,"While some blockchain projects quickly burned through the capital they raised during the heady days of 2017, others prepared for this market downturn by limiting access to their own funds.  Such was the case at the New York-based blockchain startup Blockstack, which raised nearly $54 million in 2016 and 2017 from a Series A round and a token sale to accredited investors.  With approval of its advisory board, Blockstack recently unlocked roughly $25 million of that funding when the startup surpassed its goal of getting the unique blockchain network up and running with real users. The platform currently supports dozens of decentralized applications (dapps), with the leading application Graphite Docs garnering over 4,000 users.  “It was a self-imposed thing we did for investor protection,” Blockstack co-founder Muneeb Ali told CoinDesk about the unusual choice to lock up its capital. “We, in general, have been pretty lean. We’re still less than 25 people. We definitely won’t be hiring very aggressively over the next year but [market volatility] won’t change our plans that much.”  Ali said the startup has an extended runway because Blockstack held roughly 70 percent of its capital in fiat. Plus, the 30 percent of its funds that Blockstack holds in bitcoin and ether aren’t intended to cover operating costs.  “Crypto would be the last thing we’d use,” Ali said, adding that a lock-up procedure was also applied to Blockstack’s native token so that token holders could only access their crypto a full year after the original purchase. (The tokens can be used to pay fees for services on the Blockstack network, as can bitcoin.)  He added:  “There isn’t a lot of liquidity in our system and it was designed that way. We wanted to attract parties that believe in the long-term success of the ecosystem and contribute to building it.”  Ali said that, thanks to the lockup, the company has so far spent less than 20 percent of its capital raise. Only a small amount of the available 20 percent from the raise was spent so far on development costs and a few small grants to help kick-start community contributions. The next portion of the 2017 round, roughly $10 million, will only be unlocked when the Blockstack platform supports 1 million users.  Setting conditions for these funds helped keep the startup’s spending from outpacing traction.  “We’re at the end of the infrastructure phase,” Ali said. “We want to optimize our apps so that their usability is as good as traditional web applications or cloud applications.”  Strategic incentives  Compared to projects such as the Aion Foundation and Civil, which have partially compensated participants with tokens or the promise of future tokens, Blockstack has been conservative about rolling out community incentives.  Patrick Stanley, head of growth at Blockstack, told CoinDesk the startup is waiting for regulatory clarity before it offers token rewards for developer contributions.  In the meantime, it’s leaving the task of evaluating contributions to partners like Democracy Earth, a blockchain governance startup that helps rank and evaluate Blockstack applications and runs elections where token holders can vote on which applications receive portions of a monthly bitcoin grant from Blockstack, worth $100,000 in total.  “If you’re contributing labor and value to the network, you should be compensated for that,” Stanley told CoinDesk, referring to how apps build value for users. That value is then evaluated by partners like Democracy Earth that act as market oracles, measuring sentiment and activity.  “We’ll continue to add oracles so that it would be very difficult for apps and app reviewers to game the system,” he said.  In the long run, Stanley added, Blockstack aims to increase the role community members play in token distribution, so that the startup isn’t a centralized source of rewards.  So far, this unique approach to rewarding apps with tangible traction is itself attracting curious technologists. Stanley said 2,000 people attended Blockstack meetups throughout 2018.  Ali said:  “You want to attract people that don’t even care about cryptocurrency. They are coming for different types of utility.”  Collaboration for its own sake  Unlike many token projects, Blockstack is not relying on its native cryptocurrency to fuel its business model or attract new community members.  Justin Hunter, founder of the Graphite Docs app that lets users create and share files without a third-party like the centralized alternative Google Docs, told CoinDesk his users are looking for “cloud convenience with none of the privacy trade-off.”  Hunter doesn’t own any Blockstack tokens yet, although he might someday. At the moment, he’s more focused on collaborating with the Blockstack app developers behind Stealthy and Blockusign to add privacy features and the ability to sign contracts. Improved user experience is motivation enough, no token economics required.  “Collaboration between apps on Blockstack's platform is still largely a matter of the app developers working together and writing custom code,” Hunter said. “Unlike other decentralized development platforms, Blockstack doesn't use their token to drive development.”  Hunter agreed with Ali that the crypto market slump hasn’t had any impact on user acquisition or strategy. In fact, Ali said Blockstack itself may raise more traditional venture capital in the future so that the team can focus on building a valuable ecosystem before prioritizing monetization or liquidity.  “There is room for doing a Series B or Series C,” Ali said hypothetically, adding that isn't currently the plan. “We’re years and years away until business models become pressing for us. ”  Muneeb Ali image via CoinDesk Consensus archive",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/12/13/blockstack-wont-need-to-sell-bitcoin-or-ether-to-survive-crypto-winter,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/186b991d3f6ad2dfc224eed60ec3165ec1b0169d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402316,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd40YD,1544702460,UAE Remittance Firm Launching Ripple-Based Payments in Q1 2019,"One of the largest remittance firms in the United Arab Emirates, UAE Exchange, is working with Ripple to launch blockchain-based payments to Asia by the first quarter of next year.  According to a report from Reuters on Thursday, the firm's CEO Promoth Manghat said he expects to go live with support from ""one or two banks in Asia"" using blockchain-based payments network RippleNet.  With a large number of Asian workers in the UAE, that corridor accounts for the largest portion of its global remittance flow. According to a local news report in May, transfers to India made up 36.7 percent of the remittance total, those to Pakistan 8.8 percent and the Philippines accounted for 6.9 percent.  UAE Exchange says on its website that it is associated with over 140 banks and has a presence in 31 countries, yet it's taking blockchain adoption slowly. “Blockchain holds tremendous promise for the industry but there is progress to be made before we see it go fully mainstream,” Manghat told Reuters.  The firm's collaboration with Ripple was first reported back in February, with UAE Exchange aiming to reduce cost and frictions associated with cross-border transactions.  Ripple has signed deals with several financial institutions worldwide for blockchain-based remittances. Its recent partnerships include Malaysian banking group CIMB, South Korea’s crypto exchange Coinone, U.S. banking giant PNC, among others.  Remittances market is expanding. Last year, migrant workers sent $256 billion to their families in the Asia-Pacific region alone, according to the latest United Nations’ International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) report.  And according to World Bank projections, global remittances are expected to grow at $642 billion by end of this year.

42402324,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd40g5,1544700617,Bitcoin Price Consolidates Sub-$3.5K With Bulls and Bears in Stalemate,"Bitcoin (BTC) is consolidating below $3,500 for the third day straight.  The challenge now is to gauge whether the bulls or the bears will win out in the coming days.  As discussed yesterday, the leading cryptocurrency could soon see a corrective rally if prices manage to clear the crucial resistance at $3,633 (the high of an ""inverted hammer"" candle on the 3-day chart) by Friday’s UTC close.  The bull case is also bolstered by bitcoin’s 14-week relative strength index, which is reporting oversold conditions for the first time since January 2015. A corrective rally, therefore, looks overdue.  The odds of a move above $3,633 would rise if BTC’s five-day-long narrowing price range ends with a bullish breakout. As of writing, the upper edge of the price range is located at $3,456 and the lower edge is seen at $3,360.  However, it's worth remembering that BTC has repeatedly struggled to score a significant and lasting rally in recent weeks, despite the very oversold conditions.  BTC is currently trading at $3,400 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.75 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  Hourly Chart  BTC has created a symmetrical triangle (narrowing price range) on the hourly chart. A bull breakout would validate the argument put forward by the 3-day inverted hammer candle that bargain hunters are beginning to challenge the bears' resolve to push prices lower.  As a result, the triangle breakout, if confirmed, could yield a quick move higher to $3,633.  BTC, however, risks falling to the 200-week moving average (MA) of $3,179 if prices pierce the triangle support of $3,360. That long-term MA support will likely hold ground, as the 14-week RSI is reporting extreme oversold conditions.  6-hour chart  Many market technicians believe that a break of an RSI trendline often precedes the break of a trendline in price.  Going by that logic, the falling channel breakout in the 6-hour chart RSI could be considered an advance warning of an impending bullish price move.  View  Bitcoin could see a stronger recovery rally if prices close above $3,633 on Friday.  A symmetrical triangle breakout on the hourly chart would boost the probability of BTC finding acceptance above $3,633.  A symmetrical triangle breakdown would be a bearish development, although downside could be restricted around the 200-week MA of $3,179.  That said, the bullish scenario looks more likely to play out, as the 14-week RSI is signaling extreme oversold conditions and the 6-hour RSI is biased toward bulls.

42402308,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd40RK,1544695209,Overstock Venture Chief Expects Market for Blockchain Products in 2019,"“People often say that ‘blockchain will change the world with dot-dot-dot.’ Now everybody needs to figure out what ‘dot-dot-dot’ is, and build it.”  That's how Jonathan Johnson, president of Overstock.com’s Medici Ventures, describes the blockchain-focused venture fund’s goals for 2019. He told CoinDesk that, for Medici’s 19 portfolio companies, the focus of the coming year “should change from coming up with new ideas to executing on those ideas.”  Since 2014, Overstock has invested $175 million in Medici’s portfolio companies, a list that includes the security token trading platform tZERO, enterprise tech provider Symbiont, voting app Voatz, lending startup Ripio, data managing platform Factom, and others.  Although it began as an investment arm, Medici may soon become the publicly traded company’s core business, as founder Patrick Byrne is seeking to sell the flagship online retailing site by February. If all goes according to plan, the sale would leave the company with “Medici, it’s assets and a bag of cash,” according to Johnson.  But while he said the management team views blockchain as a long-term investment, they are aiming to see some preliminary results soon.  “We want our portfolio companies to focus on having their products in production,” Johnson said, going on to explain:  “When you have a product, it starts to open up the creative juices, [people start] asking ‘how we can use it’ and it changes the discussion. When it’s mostly about technology, people want to talk about the Merkle tree, mining, nonces… All that talk gets confusing and in the way of progress.”  Medici’s chief operating officer, Steven Hopkins, agreed that delivering a product shifts the narrative.  “We need to do more than just explain what blockchain applications can be,” he said in an interview. “We need to show people how amazing blockchain is by launching blockchain products. When people can use a product, they are half the way up the learning curve of what blockchain is. And now they actually care how it works.”  By way of example, Johnson added: “I don’t know if my mother-in-law cares if a voting app uses blockchain. She would say: ‘Wait a second, is it a safe and secure way for me to vote? And I don’t have to go and wait in line at a junior high school for three hours and wait two weeks until I know who my congresswoman is?’”  Early returns  In fact, that example is more than theoretical – Johnson cited Voatz as an early success in the Medici portfolio.  The blockchain-based voting app was piloted in two West Virginia counties this year during the primaries in May, when only 13 people used it to vote. Then during the midterms in November, it was rolled out for 24 out of 55 counties. According to the official state data, 144 voters in 30 countries used the app to vote. The pilot was open to West Virginians who live overseas, a group that includes members of the military serving in foreign countries.  It’s worth noting that Voatz has been widely criticized this summer, with journalists and cybersecurity analysts questioning the quality of the solution, its security and the very notion that the app in its current state is a blockchain-based system.  Those criticisms aside, Medici considers the early results promising.  “Voatz’s debut in West Virginia went really well,” Johnson said. “It was really limited, and I think the way Voatz and the state rolled it out over the primaries, and then during the general election, was wise. I looked at some letters that came to Voatz from the military folks that said things like: ‘You finally made me like to vote.’”  As it stands, people have to rely on quite a lot of links in the chain to make sure their vote was counted as cast, Johnson went on. Even if those carrying out the voting process are reputable and highly trusted, he claimed, blockchain gives a voter an unprecedented opportunity: to log into the system after the fact and check if their vote was really counted.  This approach can radically revamp trust in the whole institution of elections, Johnson believes, so that people can “trust the system and not worry about Russian hackers.”  After the overseas voters, the next testing wave for Voatz should include disabled voters, then absentee ballot casting, Johnson believes — and then anyone should have an option to vote via the app if they want to.  Playing the long game  Despite Medici’s drag on Overstock’s bottom line – the unit lost $39 million in the first nine months of the year, contributing to a total net loss for the company of $170 million – Johnson said the plan to sell the retail business and focus on blockchain is supported by patient investors who believe in Byrne’s vision.  “Our shareholders are interested in the blockchain business, and when you look at our last earnings call, it was slide 23 when we started talking about our retail business,” Johnson said. “The Overstock team makes decisions based on what’s best for the long-term value for the company, not what’s best for the Q4, Q1, or whatever quarter we are reporting.”  Another priority in the coming year for Medici will be launching tZERO, the regulated exchange for security tokens that Byrne has long touted as a solution to Wall Street’s inefficiencies and lack of transparency.  Technically, the Overstock's Alternative Trading Platform has been open for two years, only trading tokens representing preferred shares in Overstock. However, activity has been light, with only 10 trades taking place between mid-December 2016 and March 2018, according to a public filing.  The secondary trading platform for tZERO security tokens will be up and running in earnest in January, according to Johnson, and its first additional asset will be the tZERO equity tokens that the platform sold to more than 1,000 accredited investors in August, raising $134 million.  While uncertain and still-developing regulatory regimes remain a significant impediment to effectual deployment of the technology, Medici-backed startups see working with governments directly as a critical step toward tackling that.  This is what Medici-backed startups are doing outside of the U.S., like Barbados-based fintech startup Bitt talking to central banks in the region about issuing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), or Medici Land Governance working with the Zambian government on a digital land registry.  All this helps “going from an over-regulated world to, maybe, a clearly regulated world, then to a less regulated world and to a decentralized world,” Johnson believes.  Noting that the U.S. government is “the biggest middleman” in the country right now, Medici leadership believes that the regulatory environment can be changed step by step.  “If you look at travel agents and the internet — we didn’t get rid of them overnight, we just showed that they are less and less useful for us,” Johnson said, adding:  “So, we take incremental steps in this way, we see the middlemen less necessary, we see the regulation maybe unnecessary, and we get to a point when everybody can agree with it.”  Jonathan Johnson (right) and Steven Hopkins image via CoinDesk archive",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/12/13/overstock-venture-chief-expects-market-for-blockchain-products-in-2019,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/10e87da2fa6be2c4d1b80275de1dfaa00f3794b4-2560x1434.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The firm announced Wednesday that it has partnered with a local fintech company solarisBank to create an engineering infrastructure for digital assets trading. solarisBank, which operates with a banking license in the country, will also be Boerse’s banking partner for the venture.  ""With its combination of technology and banking expertise, solarisBank is a great partner for us to offer central services along the value chain for digital assets,” said Alexander Hoptner, CEO of Boerse Stuttgart.  Initially, trading for bitcoin and ether will be enabled on the platform, with support for other tokens expected once its initial coin offering (ICO) platform – also currently under development – goes live.  Both individual and institutional investors will be able to trade on Boerse Stuttgart’s crypto platform, which will offer features similar to its stock trading platform. This includes open order books and order execution in compliance with relevant laws.  Boerse Stuttgart is also seeking a regulatory approval to offer multilateral trading facility (MTF) for its crypto trading marketplace. MTF is a type of trading system that allows matching buyers and sellers of financial instruments using electronic systems.  The stock exchange first revealed its plans to launch platforms for crypto and ICO token trading in August of this year, as well as a trading app called Bison and custody services for cryptocurrencies. The trading app will be launched by Boerse’s subsidiary Sowa Labs and will offer fee-free trading at launch, the firm said at the time.  Just yesterday, SolarisBank also teamed up with a crypto payments startup Bitwala to help them offer crypto banking services in the country.

42402322,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd40d8,1544689572,A Built-In Ethereum Wallet Just Got Added to Opera's Browser,"Opera has announced the public release of its ""Web 3-ready"" Android web browser, which notably sports a built-in cryptocurrency wallet.  Previously available in beta, Opera for Android supports ethereum's ether and other tokens using the network's ERC-20 standard. The app also provides support for crypto collectibles (ERC-721 standard) such as CryptoKitties, as well as ethereum-based decentralized apps, or dapps, that can be accessed from the wallet.  “Until now using cryptocurrencies online and accessing Web 3 required special apps or extensions, making it difficult for people to even try it out. Our new browser removes that friction,"" Charles Hamel, the product manager of Opera Crypto, said in a statement.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Hamel said the new product is largely the same as the beta version, but as it was approaching a ""much wider audience"" the firm had taken feedback on board and updated the app's user interface ""significantly.""  It now displays ""less confusing language"" to users and reduces the steps needed to set up the wallet.  The firm opted to support ethereum because it has the ""largest community of developers building dapps and has gathered a lot of momentum behind it,"" according to Opera.  Opera's crypto wallet integrates the ethereum Web3 API, facilitating interactions with dapps. The firm is calling it a ""tool to access information, make transactions online and manage users’ online identity in a way that gives them more control.""  Hearing the feedback  Hamel said that, during the beta stage, Opera had received feedback from developers wanting to ensure their dapps works as intended in the browser.  As a result, ""we have better stability and better dapp compatibility,"" he said, adding that the wallet is ""much more secure than a browser extension.""  With the Android browser now available on the Google Play store, Opera plans add similar updates to its full desktop browser for Windows, Mac and Linux some time in 2019, while a developer version is already available for testing.  Regarding an Apple iOS app, though, Hamel told CoinDesk that, since it's a more ""challenging"" and ""strict"" environment"" for app providers to operate, ""It's not a focus for us right now.""  Krystian Kolondra, executive vice president for browsers at Opera, said in a statement:  “Our hope is that this step will accelerate the transition of cryptocurrencies from speculation and investment to being used for actual payments and transactions in our users’ daily lives.”  In October, Opera announced a partnership with blockchain advisory and financial services firm Ledger Capital to further explore blockchain technology. At the time, the two companies said they were seeking new applications and use cases for blockchain, as well as “growth opportunities” for the tech within Opera products.

42402321,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd40f6,1544677234,Crypto 2018 Was a Tale Told By An Idiot – But It Doesn't Have to Signify Nothing,"James Greaves is the co-founder of Glyph, an identity service built for the blockchain era.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2018 Year in Review.    I’m completely out of crypto and I’ve been selling my bitcoin and ether all year.    Does that disgust you? Disappoint you?  If you just met me, I'm guessing that would be your first question. (When did you buy?) Unfortunately in crypto, the price when you entered appears to have some bearing on how much you know about blockchain.  However, I'd start by asking another question. When did it become doctrine to HODL and sacrilege to sell? Where does the peer pressure emanate from?    At the end of 2018, you can proclaim from the housetops that you will HODL to the end of time and you will be applauded, venerated as a sage — even if you’re lying. But if you’re going to sell, you need to slink quietly out the back door. You have broken the unwritten rules of the cult of blockchain.    My hope is that in 2019 we begin to question the norms we're holding onto, and that are holding us back.  Consistency is the Hallmark of the Unimaginative    As we enter 2019, my belief is that crypto will need a lesson in strategic execution. Like it or not, there are others like me.    My initial aim was to use crypto for everything in life, replacing all fiat, a hope that was almost immediately dashed when I entered the market at around $3,000 just last year (there's your answer to the above question). The promised land appears no closer now than it did in January.    As a store of value, I just don’t find cryptocurrency useful — it certainly hasn’t stored much value for me this year. Others likely feel the same.    Others, too, (like me) took the leap as entrepreneurs.    A finance MBA with a track record in venture capital and strategic consulting, I left my job as an executive at a SaaS technology company to start a blockchain venture. All year, I have been hearing that 2018 is the year that institutions get involved and “real players” (or at least traditional players) start to adopt the technology.    Well, some of us came. What did we find? Hype. Hyperbole. Dogma. A cult that made little sense. Not much value. Few actual results.  If I hear one more “investor” tell me I need to pay them and they will “coach me” and then introduce me to their Chinese friends, I’m going to lose my mind. Yes, it happened all the time this year.  This year I have been told:  Give me $1 million upfront so I can help raise you $10 million (no guarantees)  Give me $500,000 upfront so I can introduce you to my wealthy friends (no guarantees)  Pay me $100,000 a month to be an advisor for you — you will get me as an advisor  Pay me $20,000 a month and I will coach you every week. We will get on a conference call with my other ICOs (from someone who has never built anything).    We are the industry that is trying to change everything. What we need is constant change until we usher this technology into the world and deliver on the hype (which is significant).    The blockchain industry is both culturally inspiring and culturally broken. There’s so much good: It’s open, inclusive, revolutionary and empowering. But it’s also shady, dishonest, mercurial, and often straight-out illegal.  ICO, I Barely Knew Ye  That said, it may take use a decade to unpack all that happened in 2018 completely.    To get some distance and perspective, bitcoin’s price will likely end up five times lower than when it started, but up three or four times since January 2017.    The problem is the loudest and most visible parts of the industry have been much too focused on speculating, on raising coins quickly, flipping and making a buck. That has dragged the rest of the industry into asking bad questions. We speculated on “utility tokens” that provided no utility and had teams which have never one anything successfully before individually, let alone as a team.  But we shouldn’t forget that ICOs successfully disrupted VC, surpassing even early stage VC investment. It’s a landmark achievement for such a young industry.    I believe the ICO model still holds promise, although in a more mature way and perhaps under different guise. We’ll have to fight to keep that narrative alive. While the VC model has given us Google, Facebook, Uber, and, well pretty much everything you’ve ever heard of, the ICO model has given us ethereum and CryptoKitties.      So, the ICO model hasn’t yet replaced VC as a viable funding methodology. Promise has been shown, but the boom and bust has given its enemies ammunition to fight against it.    The Pick-and-Shovel Business    The first wave in any revolution need to be the loudest. The visionaries come first. In settling the West, first we had the mappers and fur traders, they roamed the wild and brought back tall stories and exotic things. Some found gold. That brought the gold rush, the second wave.      But prospectors don’t build anything of lasting value. I’ve been to gold rush towns in the Nevada desert. Once the gold is mined, the people leave. That’s what ghost towns are. It’s the third wave that settle the West, the farmers, the builders. They’re the common, boring, quiet folk that raise families and settle in a place forever.    Their impact is large, but their voice quiet because they’re not out carousing in the saloons and they’re not flashing their bags of gold dust.  The good news for us third-wave settlers is that there is a lot that needs to be built. At my company Glyph, we are building KYC and accredited investor tools to help the blockchain community, built with decentralization in mind out of the gate. But we need more companies that help new blockchain ventures hire and scale their management teams, pay staff in crypto, collaborate as sub industries and rapidly form strategic partnerships through research and business development.  Culture is the sum total of how everyone acts and what we are prepared to put up with. The only way you can change it is by collectively making a stand.  I, too, have been guilty of creating this culture by not doing anything to stop it. By accepting it.  In 2019, I will call this out every time I see it. I have been doing it privately since June. Maybe it’s time to start shaking out the bad actors publicly. Kicking out the wolves so the rest of us can build what needs to be built.  As 2019 starts, perhaps it’s time to reflect on what truths we hold self-evident, and which need to be eradicated from the vernacular. What are we really rallying around? Where are we going and more importantly, how are we actually going to get there?    If we are focused on the right things, we can cut through the noise.      In 2019 I hope there will be:    No more white papers. Instead people will evaluate companies on their ability to deliver results  More support companies providing tools and insights upon which others can build  No more blockchain advisors  No announcements between blockchain companies until someone has built something  Mergers of companies that can’t deliver with those that can  A large majority of blockchain conferences going out of business  More compliance, custody and technical tools that support more transparency and adoption  Security tokens that fulfill their hype while at the same time avoiding all the pitfalls of ICOs  Differentiation in the public eye between currencies and speculation.  It’s still early days. There’s a lot more to come. There’s so much happening that is so positive.
