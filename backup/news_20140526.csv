42425720,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfUvh,1401125584,The Five Biggest Threats Facing Bitcoin,"Any new, disruptive technology will have its fair share of detractors doing their best to limit its potential.  The idea that people would need their own personal computer for work seemed ludicrous 50 years ago. Why would anyone need a device for making automated calculations? Today, though, it is almost impossible to function in modern life without using a PC.  The automated teller machine, or ATM, was thought to be a needless apparatus by many when it came out. Who would need access to money outside of bank hours? Now, more people use ATMs than go and queue in branches.  Bitcoin is a new concept edging its way into the mainstream, thus, it is not immune to negativity and unfavorable public perception. It is undeniable that the digital currency has its enemies, either real people or perceived notions. So what are some of the biggest problems it faces right now?  The centralization of bitcoin  The idea of mining, for many who first come across the concept of bitcoin, seems bizarre. When broken down into a peer-to-peer way of confirming transactions, however, it makes a lot of sense.  It made a lot more sense, though, when any bitcoin node, on any computer, had a chance to confirm transactions and thus be rewarded a block. But that doesn’t happen anymore.  Although bitcoin was built with good intentions in mind, altruistic systems are often exploited. And this is what has happened to the bitcoin network.  The problem is that there is little incentive to run a node anymore. That’s because powerful machines built specifically for bitcoin’s SHA-256 proof-of-work algorithm have changed its decentralized and more open nature.  This has, in effect, concentrated bitcoin’s confirmation power, leaving it in the hands of only those who can afford thousands of dollars of ASIC hardware.  Bad actors  Bitcoin largely solves the double-spending issue. Despite that, remarkable technical achievement, it doesn’t cater for mistakes, theft and fraud quite so well.  The anonymous digital currency has sometimes attracted the wrong types of people – those looking to prey on others who fall under the spell of a never-ending upward trend for bitcoin’s price.  Whether it’s illegal online marketplaces, pump-and-dump schemes or shady crypto exchanges, they all create a black cloud over the industry. And, every time there is another bitcoin robbery or scam, it draws attention from the mainstream.  When leaders in the bitcoin industry are discouraged over their inability to be banked in the US, bad actors are the ones who should be blamed.  The bad actor problem creates a consumer protection issue for bitcoin. When people learn about bitcoin and are lured to products and services that do not follow best practices, as opaque as they may be in this industry, that’s a problem.  As a result, some countries are simply playing safe and pushing bitcoin away from their banking systems.  Reactionary regulation  According to CoinDesk’s 2014 Q1 State of Bitcoin Report, 12% of the 73 countries that have taken some regulatory action on bitcoin can be considered hostile or contentious.  A number of countries taking a stance against digital currencies appear to be more reactionary in their behaviour than seems justified.  One example is India, where a bitcoin exchange in that country was raided earlier this year, causing some bitcoin businesses to cease operating.  In China, the major operators there are talking about upcoming periods of hardship as the government cracks down on bitcoin activities.  Furthermore, amid rumors of a ban on virtual currencies in Russia, organizers recently felt impelled to cancelled a bitcoin conference that was planned to be held there.  These actions perhaps reflect more about the banking systems of those countries than anything a government official says. It reveals that many financial systems don’t want to compete with bitcoin; they would rather regulate it out of existence.  A patchwork of reactionary regulatory policies helps no one. This is especially true since international borders simply cannot restrict bitcoin, the decentralized nature of which makes it impossible to ban.  A better approach could be a wait-and-see attitude towards this new technology, since its advantages could end up befitting everyone. Countries currently taking this kind of approach include Canada and Israel.  Poor mobile platform support  Since last year, Apple has taken a proactive stance towards making sure that users cannot send bitcoin via wallets in its App Store. Furthermore, Google does not allow in-app payments with bitcoin.  Although this has not deterred some developers from creating mobile applications for bitcoin, it’s harming the ecosystem.  These larger technology companies do not want to compete with bitcoin. So they do the same thing as restrictive governments and use their power to regulate it out of existence – within their ecosystem, anyway.  Bitcoin is excellent as a method of remote payment. It could be a competitive credit card alternative – especially in remote transactions with mobile or wearable devices. And this is a much better way to receive and send payments instead of using of QR codes.  Using Bluetooth Low Energy, Near field communication (NFC) or some other wireless technology could change the way people make payments.  However, with billions of dollars relying on the outcome, the major players in the technology industry will do their best to restrict innovations that they do not control.  Low adoption  Given all of the above issues, it's not incredibly obvious why the average person would want to use bitcoin. Sure, there are many theoretical benefits to using a distributed currency.  What is the value, though, to the everyday person who just wants to ensure that money is in the bank?  One issue is that banks often overstepped boundaries and the global economic situation has brought hardship for many since 2008. The appearance of bitcoin on the scene represents something new and offers hope to people jaded by traditional financial institutions.  Circle  and Bitreserve are both bitcoin startups that have recently unveiled plans to bring the digital currency to the masses. They plan to do so by bringing the technology's benefits to the consumer market by not exposing user to the bitcoin 'layer' it still depends upon.  Many startups in the bitcoin space tout the 'wow' factor of bitcoin. Yet negative events over the past year have left consumer sentiment less positive than the industry hoped for and this, in turn, has caused tension with policymakers.  In the end, it is possible the best way to get bitcoin's benefits into the hands of people might be to not talk about it at all.

42425701,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfURh,1401120654,Facebook-Integrated Wallet Makes Sending Bitcoin as Easy as Messaging,"San Francisco-based startup QuickCoin plans to bring bitcoin to the masses via its web-based 'social wallet' that lets connected users easily send and receive bitcoin via a simple interface.  Initially, the company is integrating its product with Facebook in the hope that bitcoin will go viral on the social network, but it also has plans for further partnerships in the future.  Marshall Hayner, co-founder of the company, said that the goal for QuickCoin is to remove the complexities of bitcoin for users:  ""If average people are going to adopt bitcoin, they have to be able to use it without even really knowing they are using bitcoin, or feeling like they are subjected to a complicated process.""  Keeping it simple  QuickCoin has a simple interface that is clearly optimized for use on mobile devices, with 'Send Bitcoin', 'Receive Bitcoin', 'Logout' and 'Unlink Account' being the only available functions.  The wallet displays value in fiat currency as well as 'bits' to make the introduction to bitcoin easy for inexperienced users and to help people get over the hurdle of bitcoin's relatively high price.  ""I would often hear 'I can't get into bitcoin, that's way too expensive', [but] the reality is that bitcoin is divisible into very tiny amounts,"" Hayner said.  Bitcoin's smallest unit is a tiny 0.00000001 of a bitcoin – a unit known as a ‘satoshi’. A bit, however, is worth a more manageable 0.000001 BTC. That's around $0.00058 at today's price, so 1,000 bits would be 58 cents.  How it works  Users of the social wallet must sign in to the service using their Facebook details. The application then creates a list of contacts from Facebook friends to whom the user can send bitcoin – even if they have not signed up for the service.  To add funds to their QuickCoin wallet, users can click the 'Receive Bitcoin' option, which brings up a QR code containing the wallet key. Funds can also be sent to an external wallet via the 'Send Bitcoin' option.  When bitcoin is sent to a Facebook contact, a notification shows up in the receiver's timeline letting them know they have received the funds.  See the company's demo below:  Starting with Facebook  Hayner told CoinDesk that a Facebook-centric social wallet seemed like the best avenue for starting a bitcoin company. This certainly makes sense considering the social network had around 1.28 billion users as of March 2014.  However, said Hayner, he and the company's other co-founders William Cotton and Nathan Lands (who organized February's Bitcoin Fair in San Francisco), have other services planned:  ""QuickCoin Social Wallet is our first product. Facebook is only the beginning and we have plans for some amazing features and partnerships in the months to come.""  As bitcoin is still an early adopter technology, getting bitcoin in the hands of as many people as possible is something that the industry needs in order to progress.  That's why QuickCoin's founders have kept its wallet as simple as possible, believing that even aspects of the technology such as QR codes should only be introduced to users if absolutely necessary.  ""Not everyone has the time to do extensive research about bitcoin before they begin to use it,"" said Hayner. ""In fact, most of the people browsing the Internet today couldn't tell you how DNS works, the same is true for bitcoin.""

42425714,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfUnh,1401113852,Bitcoin and Regulation: Lessons from the Early Days of Skype,"Michael Jackson, former COO of Skype and current venture capital investor at Mangrove Capital Partners, explores how bitcoin companies can learn from the early struggles Skype had with regulators across the globe.  For all the differences between Skype and bitcoin, there are many similarities.  Both products use fundamental changes in technology to enable new opportunities, and they both remove the existing organizational hierarchy of their respective industry. As such, parallels can be made and valuable lessons can be learned from the early days of Skype.  The bitcoin industry seems to be adamant that bitcoin is a currency and bitcoin companies are financial institutions. This was very much in evidence at Bitcoin2014, where all major actors were describing their progress to ‘regulatory compliance’. But is this necessary?  From the inception of Skype, we could have said that the firm is a telco (telecommunications company). We could have decided to apply for telecoms licences all around the world and customize the product to both match and support the vagaries of different rules and directives.  It would have been the logical thing to do and it is similar to the route many bitcoin actors are taking today. However, if Skype had done so, it would have been the worst strategic mistake it ever made.  At that time, the world had changed from large, government-owned telcos to a new paradigm. Had we tried to establish Skype as a telco, rules and perversity would have appeared, driven by a dangerous combination of lack of knowledge, good intentions and political pressure.  We would have entered the same world that many bitcoin operators appear to have chosen, a world in which our ideals would have been suppressed by forces outside our control.  Let’s try and learn from previous successes. Let’s see if we can navigate the complexities of the legal and regulatory situation, using some of the experiences and techniques that were adopted by Skype – techniques that could help reduce any regulatory influence or restrictions on bitcoin.  Regulation is not a given  As a congressman in the US told me one day, something that looks like a duck and quacks like a duck must be treated like a duck. If Skype looked like a phone company and sounded like a phone company, then it must be a phone company. But Skype was never a phone company, and never will be.  There are many technical arguments as to why this was so, but the most relevant here is that Skype was simply a piece of software. It was a piece of software that was developed by a company and released directly to the users.  The users created the network and the existence of Skype as a network was independent of Skype as a company. Skype simply provided a part of the network.  To argue otherwise would be to argue that anyone who makes cables, or handsets, or even the bricks and mortar and relays and batteries for telephone exchanges is also a phone company. This would be truly absurd. If Skype, the company, closed down, the software would still be in the wild and the whole world would still be able to talk for free.  Sound familiar?  We, the bitcoin community, need to make these arguments better. The default position of the products and services derived from bitcoin must be that they are not to be regulated. They need not be, and the existing rules need not apply. They may apply in intent, but often the wording is poor, unsuitable and can be argued to be irrelevant.  To put it bluntly – every bitcoin actor should be reading the law very carefully and finding the loopholes. You should all invest a great deal of time in this – it is hugely important. For example, are you really moving ‘currency’ or are you simply exchanging some sort of token?  Life is going to be a lot easier if we take the latter position, as there are no rules that prevent the exchanging of keys. Likewise there are no rules that say keeping a string of data in a cold storage vault makes a business a bank.  So far, many of the proponents of bitcoin have been taking entirely the wrong approach – making claims that attract a raft of unwanted rules and regulations.  Untouched by regulation?  The anonymity of the Internet provides a nice place to exist. Yet, almost everything needs to touch the real world from time to time and Skype was no exception.  We chose to connect to the existing phone network. Similarly, some parts of the bitcoin ecosystem need, at least for the time being, to interface with existing financial systems. However, the minute these interfaces exist, the same minute the product becomes touched by existing rules and the need for partners arises.  In any world, these partners are worried too. The first companies that connected Skype to the phone network took risks. These partners need clear arguments around why they are safe and why the service they provide is in compliance with the rules.  These arguments need to be clear and based on fact and legal opinions. Rhetoric has no place. Banking institutions, burnt by the financial crisis and subsequent AML (anti-money laundering) and KYC (know your customer) fines need solid facts, not lofty ambitions.  Skype is not a replacement phone service, it doesn’t claim to be, and in fact it emphatically tells users that it is not. This positioning is important. It tells users not to expect certain things and, as a result, some people may choose not to use the product.  At Skype, we would have loved to have had incoming numbers for everyone all over the world and to have provided an amazing 911 service based on text, video and status messaging, but the existing rules don’t permit that. So we provided none, and forewent the opportunities of a seamless interface into the existing world – all the time. Though for the greater good.  How can it be made easier?  Firstly, those in bitcoin companies should make sure that any regulated activities are headquartered and operating in one place – that way, there should only be one set of folk to deal with.  Business owners can also use these rules to their advantage – the rules of international commerce, taxation and regulation. Well-intentioned bitcoin businesses exist to provide great services to the mass market and to unlock the huge potential of the transformations provided by cryptographic tokens.  For all the negative press the NSA gets, it isn't the enemy to bitcoin businesses. The enemy is the bureaucracy, which asks for volumes of data, licence requirements and bad old-fashioned paperwork. Bureaucrats, trying to understand a new technology and with plenty of time on their hands.  The enemy is time and getting the product to market early. Businesses should also be open to engaging with regulators, simply to keep the debate on the right side. It should be no more than that and certainly shouldn’t be central to any company’s external communications.  No exceptions  These arguments need to be consistent across a company: if the firm believes its activities shouldn’t be regulated, it should be able to argue this point and stay true to it. Companies should not make any allowances, but realise there will always be people who want them to make an exception.  In some countries, companies may only be asked to fill in the simplest of forms, but even the simplest of exceptions can be used by others. The biggest challenge of the industry is consistency. The clear message that must be sent from the entire community is that most activities are not regulated.  Some businesses in the bitcoin space will find they require some crossover with existing regulated services and they may find these services operate rules they don’t want to obey. Tough luck. Try and change the rules instead – it isn’t that difficult.  As an example, the 'Pulver order’ moved VOIP regulation in the US from state level to federal. Jeff Pulver ran a small company – and he won. I changed mobile access rules in Europe myself, as a single individual and without the help of lawyers. It takes time and patience, and you might have to buy a suit, but it can be done.  Reducing the impact of regulation  There’s a reason many of the most well-known companies are split into various operating units, and it isn’t tax – it’s regulation.  Bitcoin firms should make sure they put the parts of the business that are going to be controlled into one company and everything else in another. It’s an awful lot easier to manage a regulated entity if it has virtually no employees and few activities.  [post-quote]  Let’s say you run an exchange, for example. It exchanges fiat for cryptocurrency and then sends the proof of ownership of these tokens to the other side of the world.  Some regulation requires that any company doing monetary transactions needs to report all transactions.  The answer is to split the company: perhaps one part does the fiat to crypto transaction and the other part sends them on. Then you only have to apply the regulations to a smaller part of the company, and can maintain the flexibility of the other half. If the egress point needs regulation in a specific country, set up a small entity to do that there.  Efforts should be made to ensure that a regulator doesn’t need to consider what happens in a different country over which they have no jurisdiction.  Don’t ask permission  Companies need to just carry on doing what they are doing, if they can make a case for themselves that they don’t need regulation, they shouldn't even go near it.  People do what they love best: regulators like regulations and want to apply them. If they didn’t, they would have a different job. So, asking for advice is framing the discussion. Once again, companies should read the rules, argue why they are not covered by the rules and use that analysis as a defence, but they should only ask for permission if they are sure it is necessary.  Furthermore, companies shouldn’t ask a lawyer. Expecting a lawyer to find a loophole in the law and to state it on paper simply won’t happen. People should read, understand and learn it themselves. They can test their argument on a lawyer, indeed on anyone, but should not expect anyone else to come up with it.  These principles allowed us to operate Skype across the whole world, with minimal legal costs and no effect on the main parts of the business – yet fulfil the legal responsibilities that we all have when we are running a company and have employees that rely on the company to feed their children.  Most importantly, these lessons enabled Skype to become one of the leading tools that people use to communicate and forged the way to achieving our original dream. A dream that has become reality.  Today, the whole world can indeed talk for free. Bitcoin companies have the potential to make the same waves in the financial sphere.

42425705,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfUZh,1401107478,A Bot Named Willy: Did Mt. Gox's Automated Trading Pump Bitcoin's Price?,"There is more speculation today that bitcoin's November 2013 surge and Mt. Gox's trading volumes were built in part on fraudulent trading activity – specifically via a bot that serious traders have dubbed ""Willy"".  Bitcoin's price on Mt. Gox rocketed from around $200 in early November to its $1,236 all-time high on 4th December, exciting early adopters and causing analysts to go into fits over the cause: was it Chinese speculation on that country's fee-free exchanges? Or perhaps a mass exodus to digital currency after its resistance to government seizure was noted during the Silk Road affair?  The 'Willy Report', a one-post default-themed Wordpress site, gives a detailed rundown of the suspected bots' trading activity from around September to the end of November 2013.  The mystery traders  According to the blog's writer, a trader who analyzed publicly-released logs from the time, trading bots ran rampant through the system under various user IDs, including one dubbed ""Willy"" that placed repetitive buy-only orders that always manipulated the price upward.  Another bot, dubbed ""Markus"", appears to have bought and sold at completely random prices, paying zero trading fees. Both Willy and Markus were most active immediately before and during November 2013, when bitcoin's price suddenly headed moonward.  The analysis is based on data leaked to the public on 9th March this year, which included details of all trades on Mt. Gox between April 2011 and November 2013. No data since that period is currently available, though there are anecdotal reports of activity matching that of Willy and Markus after December.  To November, the two trading entities bought a total of 570,000 BTC, enough to have an impact on price. Was bitcoin's value in late 2013 even less inherent than sneering anti-crypto economic analysts have claimed?  Who were they?  Speculation now falls on whether the activity is the result of outside hackers gaming the system for profit (like Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles' claims) or an inside job, representing the interests of the (very) few people with access to the exchange's innards?  Both bots were among the 500 highest-volume users on Mt. Gox, whose activities are graphed here. Willy and Markus represent the two most anomalous trading charts, #281 'Greater Fools' and #15 'Glitch in the System' respectively.  Markus frequently appears to spend the same low amount of money (around $15) no matter how large the trade, suggesting data in that field is misleading or non-existent.  Strange records  Odd patterns in the two trading entities' buying behaviour are compounded by suspicious details in their user registration data. Willy had only '??' listed for a country code when all other accounts were identifiable. Markus' location was listed as 'Japan', and both had ID numbers unusually high compared to other users'.  The Willy entity was also unaffected by Mt. Gox's downtimes, continuing to buy between 10-20 BTC every 5-10min even at times when the exchange was non-functional to regular users, leading the blog author to conclude:  ""This makes it likely the bot was being run from a local Mt. Gox server. It is not impossible that a hacker was able to install some kind of rootkit on Mt. Gox’s servers and ran the bot from there, but that seems extremely unlikely.""  The anonymous author of Willy Report does not give much credit to the external hacker theory. Willy's balance is absent from the balance summary leaked at the time of Gox's collapse in February, and Markus' is only 20 BTC. There do not appear to be any withdrawals to match the large trades.  Details of Markus' activity is curiously corrected in a separate, anonymized version of Mt. Gox's trade data from April 2013 that matched the leaked version in every other way. The entity's ID number also appears in that version as '634' – the ID connected to Mark Karpeles.  Suspected manipulative trading activity on Mt. Gox had been a discussion point among serious traders watching the exchange even back in 2013, and was apparently confirmed once the trade data was leaked.  The Willy Report author also suggests signs of suspicious activity in the lead up to bitcoin's first mainstream attention-grabbing run, in April 2013.  Trusting exchanges  Once again, dark clouds have gathered, not around the bitcoin network itself but around the centralized gateways guarding the on- and off-ramps between it and the legacy financial system.  Such businesses have operated mostly off the block chain and are inherently trust-based, functioning effectively as unofficial and uninsured banks. With developers and executives from the technology world rather than the financial, they have been accused of everything from incompetence to malice before their funds simply vanish – often along with the businesses' owners.  A trustless crypto-based payment system still relies heavily on trusted supports. More often than not, these 'trusted supports' are unregulated, hence they attract unscrupulous traders and speculators.  Those in the pro-regulation camp point to the inherent weakness of unregulated exchanges as one of the biggest problems facing bitcoin, but regulation remains a controversial topic in the bitcoin community and there is no clear consensus on what should or could be done to stamp out abuse.

42377275,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70A29,1401104669,'Watch Dogs' Game Torrent May Be Infected with Crypto Mining Malware,"Hackers may have started employing a clever tactic in an effort to enlist powerful PCs into cryptocurrency mining botnets.  According to GameCrastinate, a game torrent is installing bitcoin mining malware on the computers of thousands of unsuspecting users. The torrent in question is Watch Dogs, an upcoming AAA title from Ubisoft, which is scheduled to officially launch tomorrow, 27th May.  However, the reports have been questioned by some gamers who claim that they downloaded the same torrent – with no bitcoin mining malware in tow. Of course, this does not mean that the torrent is safe, as some users may have evaded infection through other means.  If it is true, the new approach is a clever one, as it makes life easier for botnet operators on more than one level.  Quality vs quantity  Botnets are supposed to be big, the bigger the better. However, this rule does not always apply to mining botnets.  Infecting an ancient PC with integrated graphics is pointless and to some extent counterproductive. However, gaming PCs powered by high-end graphic cards make a lot more sense – AMD Radeons based on Tahiti and Hawaii GPUs, such as the Radeon R9 290, R9 280 and HD 7900 series, remain a popular choice for many altcoin miners out there.  Nobody would try to download, install and run a demanding game like Watch Dogs on sub-par hardware, so in theory this approach could give the attacker access to a limited pool of PCs, but practically every one of them would have a powerful GPU.  Furthermore, a smaller botnet is harder to detect, and just a few dozen gaming rigs can mine more altcoins than hundreds of antiquated office boxes.  AMD’s market share in the discrete graphics market hovers around 33%, with Nvidia accounting for the rest. In other words, one in three gaming PCs is equipped with a relatively powerful Radeon card, making these a viable mining platform for altcoins based on the scrypt algorithm, such as litecoin and dogecoin.  Pitfalls to the scheme  Using torrented games to spread mining malware makes sense, as it allows the attacker to specifically target PCs capable of delivering a lot of parallel computing performance. Using an unreleased title is a clever choice too, as torrents of unreleased builds tend to be unstable and exhibit performance issues, so the added load of GPU mining could be hidden to some extent.  There are a few problems though. PC gamers are hardware enthusiasts and most of them would notice the telltale signs of mining with relative ease. For example, high-end graphics cards are inaudible in 2D mode, but when they are placed under load, they can by anything but silent, as they ship with one to three fans that throttle up as the GPU starts crunching numbers.  Such an attack should be easily detected and, since it would be associated with a single source in the form of a torrent file, the infected torrent would be easy to trace and eliminate.",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/26/watch-dogs-game-torrent-may-be-infected-with-crypto-mining-malware,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc33dace27ed133c199b58900394812a839766af-1210x630.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
