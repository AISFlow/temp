21095670,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=563959,1701817253,8 Green Candles: Here’s What Happened To Bitcoin The Last Time It Appeared,"Bitcoin is on an impressive run and finally broke above $40,000 for the first time in over a year. This run has been in the making for a few months with the climax coming between the months of October and December. As a result, Bitcoin has now recorded 8 green candles on the weekly chart and historical performance suggests that this is bullish for the price. 8 Green Candles For BTC On The Weekly Chart In the last two months, the Bitcoin price has consistently closed in the green, a trend that seemed foreign only a few months ago. This green trend has continued through November which was expected to be a bearish month and with the start of December, Bitcoin saw another green weekly close. Related Reading: LUNC Stuns With 300% Gains, Can It Reach Its Previous ATH Market Cap? During this time that the BTC price has seen consistent green closes on the weekly chart, the price has gone from as low as $27,000 to as high as $42,000. This means that the price has risen approximately 50%, adding around $15,000 to its value in this two-month period. This comes amid a time of polarizing views between the bulls and the bears despite the bullish indicators continuously winning out. The gains of the last eight weeks have completely washed out a year of intense bearish headwinds and have seen the Bitcoin price completely recover all its losses from the FTX collapse, as well as its far-reaching contagion. BTC price readies for another leg up | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com What Happens To Bitcoin The Last Time? With Bitcoin, historical performance can often be a good pointer to future performance, especially when important trends are being repeated. For example, the last time that the digital asset confirmed 8 green candles on the weekly chart, the price exploded not too long after. Related Reading: AVAX Uprising: Crypto Analyst Predicts Bullish Wave To Push Price To $30 This is seen back in 2017 right at the start of the bull market where the price went from around $1,100 to $2,900 before a slight pullback. However, once the pullback was over, the price would begin another uptrend that would send Bitcoin above $10,000 for the first time ever. If this trend were to repeat itself this time around, then a pullback from this level is likely, but not expected to last. The resulting pump from the pullback will likely be the confirmation of the bull market, leading to a new all-time high price. Bitcoin has also done incredibly well following 8 green candles on the daily charts. As reported by NewBTC, the Bitcoin price has also risen quickly when these green candles appear. As such, it is an all-around bullish signal for Bitcoin.

42409270,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcFbHk,1701815954,Tiny Euro-Pegged Stablecoin Surges 200% on Binance Before Exchange Halts Trading Due to 'Abnormal Volatility',"The anchored euro (AEUR) stablecoin, which is supposedly pegged to 1 euro, surged nearly 200% Tuesday on Binance after being listed on the crypto exchange yesterday.  The AEUR-USDT pair was trading at around $1.08 for the most part of the day, roughly in line with the EUR-USD exchange rate at the time, Binance trading data shows. The token started to rise sharply at around 17:45 UTC with high volumes, hitting a high of $3.25.  The platform suspended trading with the token due to ""abnormal volatility,"" Binance later said in an X (formerly Twitter) post.  The token's order book – aggregating traders' buy and sell orders – on Binance shows that the last trade was executed at 18:31 UTC at around $2.89, still 167% higher than its intended value.  AEUR is issued by Switzerland-based Anchored Coins, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Singapore investor and former parliament member Calvin Cheng, according to a press release from earlier this year. The token's value is supposed to be backed by euro fiat assets and has a market capitalization of $5 million, the project's website shows.  There was no apparent reason for the unusual price surge. However, the token's low market cap and limited liquidity in theory could make it more vulnerable to de-pegging by potential price manipulation.

21094206,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564010,1701813647,"Solana’s BONK Climbs To 3rd Place In Dog Coin Market Cap, Leaving FLOKI Behind","In recent weeks, the Solana (SOL) blockchain has been making waves in the crypto world, with its native token SOL experiencing a remarkable uptrend of 46% over the past 30 days. Alongside this surge, Bonk Inu (BONK), the first Solana-based meme coin, has gained significant traction, solidifying its position as the third-largest dog coin by market capitalization, surpassing Floki Inu (FLOKI). BONK Rockets To New Heights With 845% Surge In 30 Days The staggering growth of Bonk Inu is evident in its recent performance, achieving an impressive 845% gain over the past 30 days. The meme coin’s remarkable ascent has propelled it to new yearly highs, while SOL experienced a slight pullback from its peak of $65 on December 2. Despite the temporary setback for SOL, the bullish momentum and renewed interest in Bonk Inu have caught the attention of market participants. As of now, BONK is trading at $0.0000069712, outperforming the broader crypto market with a remarkable 22.4% uptrend in the past 24 hours, aligning with the positive sentiment surrounding Bitcoin (BTC) and the overall market. With a market capitalization of approximately $430 million, Bonk Inu currently sits in third place among dog coins, trailing behind the likes of Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE), which boast market caps of $5 billion and $12 billion, respectively. Related Reading: Warning Signals Flash As Bitcoin Surges: Expert Spotlights Potential $25,000 Liquidity Sweep CoinGecko data reveals that BONK has witnessed a significant 24-hour trading volume of $65,235,205.16, indicating strong investor interest and active participation in the market. The future trajectory of Bonk Inu’s uptrend and its potential for further gains remains uncertain. However, should BONK continue to attract investors, it has the potential to dethrone Pepecoin (PEPE) in terms of market capitalization. As of the latest update, PEPE has achieved a market cap of $592 million. However, it is important to note that Bonk Inu still has a significant gap to bridge to catch up with the largest dog coins in the market in terms of market capitalization, namely SHIB and DOGE. SHIB and DOGE have demonstrated substantial gains and already possess staggering market capitalizations. Dog Coins Make Strong Push For Year-End Gains The altcoin SHIB, built on the Ethereum platform and known for its Shiba Inu mascot, continues to demonstrate consistent gains across various time frames. Notably, SHIB has seen a 14% increase over the past fourteen days and an 18% surge over the past thirty days. These positive trends have allowed the dog coin to achieve a slight year-to-date profit of 0.2% after experiencing a significant downturn in 2022. Presently, SHIB is trading at $0.00000946, representing a decline of more than 89% from its all-time high (ATH) of $0.00008616, reached in October 2021. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Surges With Over 8 Billion SHIB Burned, Here’s The Trigger Meanwhile, the meme coin DOGE, which has the backing of Elon Musk, is currently trading at $0.09058. It has witnessed an 18% rise over the past fourteen days and nearly 30% growth over the past thirty days, following a sustained upward trend that began on November 21. However, in contrast to SHIB’s price action, DOGE has experienced a 12% decline year-to-date and an 87% drop from its ATH of $0.731578 reached in May 2021. It remains to be seen whether the dog coins will continue to experience further gains throughout the remainder of the year or if a healthy pullback will occur to surpass upper resistance levels for another upward movement.

42409284,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcFboo,1701811217,Fresh Money Flows to Crypto as Stablecoin Market Expands After 18-Month Downtrend,"Stablecoin market cap expanded for the first time since May 2022, with Tether's USDT being the main beneficiary, rising to an all-time high supply of nearly $90 billion.  The trend reversal is a sign of improving liquidity in the crypto market as more capital enters the ecosystem, analysts said.  Fresh money is entering cryptocurrencies as the stablecoin market is expanding for the first time in more than 18 months, highlighted by Tether's USDT rising to an all-time high market cap of $89 billion.  Glassnode data shows that the combined market capitalization of the largest stablecoins increased by almost $5 billion over the past month to $124 billion.  The expansion represents a major trend reversal from a sustained downtrend that started in May 2022, roughly coinciding with the beginning of the grueling crypto winter.  Stablecoins are token versions of cash, serving as a crucial plumbing of the crypto ecosystem, bridging traditional (fiat) money and blockchain-based digital asset markets and providing market participants with liquidity for trading and lending.  Thus, the trend reversal in the stablecoin market size is a bullish signal for the overall health of the recent crypto rally.  ""This upward trend can be interpreted as a leading indicator of improving liquidity on-chain, suggesting an environment where more capital is available for deployment,"" Tanay Ved, analyst at Coin Metrics, said in a market report Tuesday.  Tether supply rises to all-time highs  Most of the expansion comes from Tether [USDT], the largest stablecoin by market cap and mostly used on centralized exchanges and for transactions in the developing world. Its supply has increased by $7 billion since September, Matrixport noted in a Monday report, with minting picking up ""in a meaningful way"" since mid-October.  Actually, USDT's market cap has grown has been growing through most of 2023 and is now nearing $90 billion, above its all-time high in 2022, CoinGecko data shows. But the contraction of competitors such as USDC and BUSD had offset USDT's growth until recently.  ""The trend seems to be up, which should be bullish for crypto assets as it signals growing investor interest,"" said Noelle Acheson, analyst and author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter.  ""It’s still early as the total stablecoin market cap is still well below levels from earlier this year, when the outlook was arguably much worse than it is today,"" she added.

21092640,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564001,1701810005,"Ethereum At $2,200 Is “Hilarious”; Is A 10X Incoming?","Crypto investor Ryan Sean Adams argued on December 4 that Ethereum’s (ETH) current valuation of around $2,200 is almost “hilarious” given the strengthening on-chain activity and the blockchain’s role in the sphere. Venture Capitalist: Here’s Why Ethereum Is Grossly Undervalued Adams cited data like the first smart contract platform generating billions annually in “gas” fees, transitioning to becoming deflationary after merging in September 2021, and the over one million validators staking earning over 5% as rewards. Moreover, the venture capitalist pointed out the potential of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving spot Ethereum ETFs in the long run. For now, BlackRock and Fidelity, two of the world’s most prominent traditional finance players, have applied to issue these derivative products. Though the SEC has yet to approve any spot crypto ETFs, the agency will authorize one or multiple, likely in early Q1 2024. Related Reading: Warning Signals Flash As Bitcoin Surges: Expert Spotlights Potential $25,000 Liquidity Sweep Overall, the crypto market expects any spot ETF, including that of Ethereum, to attract billions in institutional capital. Beyond external factors like the SEC and ETFs talk, Adams also pointed out the rising demand for mainnet block space from the multiple layer-2 solutions running off-chain rollups parallel to Ethereum. ETH Value Draws From On-Chain Activities According to L2Beat, Ethereum layer-2 solutions have over $14.9 billion as total value locked (TVL), with the most prominent platforms, including Arbitrum One, OP Mainnet, Starknet, and Base, commanding billions and processing tens of thousands of transactions daily. In the past week, Adams observed that leading layer-2 rollups were the top 10 consumers of Ethereum block space. Comparing Ethereum using traditional metrics like price-earnings (P/E) ratios that compare favorably to technology companies like Amazon and Zoom, Adams suggested that Ethereum’s upside is almost mathematically unavoidable this cycle. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Surges With Over 8 Billion SHIB Burned, Here’s The Trigger The venture capitalist, based on the above factors, thinks Ethereum could likely be 10x, pushing the coin to over $22,000 per coin. Even so, the investor can’t precisely gauge how long the markets will “stay irrational,” grossly undervaluing the second most valuable coin. In response, Uniswap founder Hayden Adams agreed Ethereum fundamentals would fuel appreciation. Even so, the founder thinks Ethereum derives strength not from speculation attributes, as Ryan Sean Adams laid out. The Uniswap founder is confident that demand from active protocols launching on the mainnet and competing for scarce block space will directly pump prices. According to Ultra Sound Money, Uniswap helps Ethereum burn the most coins. In the last month alone, Uniswap took over 14,900 ETH out of circulation, helping the network become more deflationary.

42409264,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcFb7p,1701809857,The Funniest Anon on Crypto Twitter,"Gwart is the funniest person on Crypto Twitter. That is a statement made by several of crypto’s leading voices. And like many funny people, he is also a truth-teller. The things Gwart says — covering incredibly dry topics ranging from Ethereum alignment to the rapid rise of ZKsnarks — are funny because they are true.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  For years, Gwart’s voice was lost in the sea of innumerable crypto “anons,” or the pseudonymous blockchain users who live and breathe on-chain tech, post on X and often seem to know the inner workings of both better than any of the industry’s talking heads. He created this specific “alt” in 2021 and languished in obscurity for most of the time since.  This year, he’s gotten his due. “You can call me the funniest person on Twitter. I accept this,” Gwart, not his real name, said in an interview. I mentioned this point when asking why he thinks he’s gotten so much attention recently. ""I probably tweet a bit differently than most people, I don't take much of this stuff very seriously,” he said.  In other words: he has the bravery of a clown. And like jokesters of yore, he’s willing to make a mockery of the king’s court. His performance helps expose the things everyone thinks, but dares not say.  Take one of his favorite posts:  Or mine:  Gwart, who took his memorable profile pic from a mute character in the TV show “Silicon Valley,” has an uncanny ability to condense down the ovehanging problems of the contemporary crypto scene into 280 characters. It’s not that others haven’t pointed out that crypto, after nearly a decade and a half (about as long as Uber has existed), hasn’t yet found a use case, it’s that he covers the bitter truth with a little sweetness.  ""I troll in a way that even when I'm being pretty sarcastic about something that maybe people feel very ideological about I do in a way that is, like, sort of endearing,"" he said.  You may not think that crypto, which has spent much of the past year in the doldrums, being criticized by the media and avoided by the greater public, needs to be mocked any more. But Gwart’s commentary and criticism is often seen as valuable.  ""I think I'll say things in a way that people are kind of like ‘yeah, that's sort of undeniable,’” he said, adding, “maybe I might give myself too much credit.”  Gwart can disarm while also getting people to engage. That’s part of the reason the Hayden Adams and Paradigms of the world interact with and respond to him. The other part is, as a super heavy DeFi user, his concerns are valid. He said he “went so far down the rabbit hole” of DeFi and emerged thinking “this stuff is ridiculous.”  See also: Defiant by Default; Why Regulators Must Understand, Not Police, DeFi | Consensus@Consensus  It doesn’t take an econ degree from a good school, which Gwart has, to know that something is amiss with circular tokenomics and trading systems where “frontrunning” is an expected (and maybe necessary) part of the market structure. But unlike his fanbase, the kings and queens of DeFi, Gwart is losing hope solutions will be found.  While his biggest audience hails from Ethereum, Gwart is a Bitcoiner. “To the extent that I'm dogmatic about anything, it's probably bitcoin,” he said. “I've sort of drunk the Kool Aid.”  Although he is not a “laser-eyed maxi” (i.e. the stereotypical Bitcoin maximalist is carnivorous, hates the Fed and prays to Satoshi before sleeping), he does think bitcoin has more “durability” than crypto and potentially the U.S. dollar.  See also: You Can Be a Bitcoin Maximalist and Like Ethereum, Too | Opinion  “With crypto, it's like, ‘move fast, break things,’” Gwart said. “A lot of times we don't even really know what we're attempting to accomplish.” There could be future use cases for blockchains, but that whole side of crypto is basically just tech, he said. It can iteratively improve, but doesn’t really have an “end goal.”  Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a movement with a destination. “I’m here for the revolution,” he said. Crypto, especially DeFi, or the subsector working to replace actual financial operations like credit extension, banking and exchanges with intermediary-less, self-executing smart contracts, might beg to differ.  Gwart hesitates to dismiss the wider world of crypto entirely, he admits that there’s likely something to the core idea behind NFTs (he likes CryptoPunks and Miladys, in particular) and that U.S. dollar stablecoins have found “product-market-fit.” But the fact that the biggest use for blockchain today are things like USDT and USDC is sort of an affront to the founding vision that inspired this industry.  See also: Paolo Ardoino: The Hardest Working Man in Crypto | Most Influential  Many Gwart supporters may not like hearing all this, but it’s hard to imagine Gwart caring. Gwart apparently did well for himself during DeFi Summer (2020), and is currently unemployed and in no rush to go back to work. He owns a small real-estate company and, for a time, chose to work part-time on a farm to fulfill a longtime dream. That is to say, Gwart enjoys spending his days busting chops on Twitter and stirring up trouble using his various pseudonymous accounts (Gwart is his biggest).  “I’m sort of the black sheep,” Gwart said, when asked about his family. He said his parents know he sometimes calls himself Gwart online, which makes a handful of people, including a few in crypto, who know both the man and alias. “They are generally very supportive of whatever I do. They just assume I’ll figure it out,” he said, laughing.  So what’s next for Gwart? He said he would consider working at a Bitcoin company, one that he’s ideologically-aligned with. And someone recently approached him about doing a podcast…",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/05/the-funniest-anon-on-crypto-twitter,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/afe3990814a2473e25c50e6eb9e9a93a8d296db2-1920x906.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409274,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcFbUy,1701809178,Why Are People Spreading Falsehoods About Bitcoin’s Water Use?,"By now you may have heard some of the fuss around a commentarypublished in a scientific journal that allegedly details how Bitcoin is destroying the environment by consuming too much water. The commentary has been picked up and spread around by mainstream media, despite its multiple factual and mathematical inaccuracies.  This may trigger some eye-rolling and “here we go again.” For years, we have had to work hard to debunk the false claims about Bitcoin’s energy consumption, which ranged from unhinged declarations that Bitcoin miningwould use up all the energy in the world, to more understandable, albeit, lazyconfusion about what a Bitcoin transaction even is. We more or less won that – few regulators these days insist Bitcoin mining should be banned because of its environmental impact, instead pivoting to cite itsillicit use as the main reason for outright rejection.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading, and host of the CoinDesk Markets Daily podcast. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  It’s almost as if mainstream media has been searching for another platform from which to justify its judgemental condescension. To this eager audience, data scientist Alex de Vries, founder of Digiconomist, delivered a commentary titled: “Bitcoin’s growing water footprint.”  No conspiracy theories here  It’s a clever idea, if your aim is to reverse the growing global acceptance that Bitcoin mining can be a positive environmental force.  Climate fear mongering has been a tool-of-the-trade for some time in the clicks industry, and it is timely given the ongoing COP28 summit. Combine some existential doom with a scary new financial system that no-one can seemingly control, and the mainstream press will of course lap it up.  What’s more, the new focus is particularly topical – water issues are now a regular feature in my daily reads. This weekend, for instance, economist Mariana Mazzucato and others published a piece in Project Syndicate called “Water and the High Price of Bad Economics.” On Friday, the UN published itsGlobal Drought Snapshot with unsurprisingly chilling statistics. On Thursday, Bloombergreported on the drought in the Amazon, last week The Economistcovered the drought in Panama. I could go on, but you get the picture.  It's perhaps even more ingenious in that the implied scarcity is in a different category. The “too much energy” debate was pretty easy to debate philosophically – after all, we can make more energy, either by extracting it from the ground or better harnessing the sun’s rays (to choose two examples). Energy is not a zero-sum game. Water, for now, is. If indeed Bitcoin is consuming “too much” water, that’s less water for thirsty citizens or essential agriculture. Running out of water feels more fatal than running out of energy.  And we’ve all seen how the fireball topic of climate destruction can be effectively used to alienate precisely those that could most benefit from Bitcoin: the younger western demographic, who are not as invested in trusting the current system as older generations, and who really should be thinking about how to save amid the currency debasement that’s coming.  Now, I’m not suggesting that de Vries is part of a coordinated effort to discredit the crypto ecosystem, at a time when official recognition of its environmental potential was starting to consolidate and legacy finance was getting ready to embrace the opportunity to service a greater range of Bitcoin products. No, I wouldn’t do that, I’m not a conspiracy theorist.  But you must admit the timing is convenient, and it is remarkable how quickly mainstream media picked up a comment in an obscure scientific journal that I am sure is not part of the journalists’ regular morning reads. Oh, and did I mention that Alex de Vries works for the Dutch central bank?  It just ain’t so  Now, on to the main things that de Vries gets wrong.  This part is important, because it’s going to be up to all of us to patiently explain to anyone who brings this up why the data and the conclusions are factually incorrect.  First, de Vries attempts to calculate the water consumption per transaction. This shows either a misunderstanding of how Bitcoin works or a wilful misdirect, and since de Vries has been researching Bitcoin energy use for at least five years (that I’m aware of), I’m guessing it’s the latter.  Bitcoin miners in aggregate pay for electricity to process blocks of transactions, and the number of blocks is predictable (one every 10 minutes or so). The calculable metric is consumption (of electricity or water) per block. Each block can contain one or thousands of transactions, depending on demand and size (in terms of memory consumption). Currently, there are around 3-4,000 transactions per block, but earlier this year, the number was more like 1,000.  And each transaction can contain one or millions of payments, which de Vries neglects to explain.  Second, de Vries sums together indirect water use via electricity consumption, and direct water use via rig cooling methods, asking us to believe that adding them together produces a useful figure. Water used on-site can be saved for other uses should the Bitcoin miners switch off. Water used by power generators, not necessarily. These are two very different types of water use, which cannot be lumped into one convenient yet irrelevant measure.  Furthermore, the direct use is not necessarily a water “cost,” as much of the water in cooling methods is re-used. And the indirect consumption (by the electricity source) is also not technically a “cost” since much of the water used by thermal power plants isreturned to its source after cooling. The water used by hydroelectric generation would not be significantly impacted should Bitcoin miners switch off.  Third, the math is based on very tenuous assumptions. The method de Vries uses is to estimate Bitcoin mining’s energy consumption (based on data from theCambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index), apply an approximate geographical distribution, factor in the average energy mix by region and then extrapolate the water used by each type of energy.  Apart from the margin of error in each of those factors, this method assumes that all miners are representative of the grid mix in their jurisdictions. This is not so – miners tend to concentrate around lower-cost sources since energy is their main continuing expense, which skews the relevant mix. What’s more, miners increasingly co-locate with energy producers to reduce waste and take advantage of stranded power.  And the representative geographical mix was based on out-of-date information. Kazakhstan, for example, is given as one of the top-three global mining jurisdictions. That may have been the case in 2021, but today,there are very few Bitcoin miners in Kazakhstan, as the industry was hit by repeated internet outages, energy shortages and regulatory barriers.  And yet, we are told, in a scientific journal, that each Bitcoin transaction consumes enough water to fill a small swimming pool. This is supposed to shock us because obviously (!?) a swimming pool is more useful, and the implication is that more Bitcoin transactions means that fewer people would be able to enjoy aquatic recreation.  Who are the real culprits?  Just when I think my disappointment with mainstream media has reached its peak, I find that there are always new heights to scale. The media handling of de Vries’ comment has been egregious.  Almost all the publications that picked up this article repeated the claims verbatim, without questioning the source of the data or the author’s track record (de Vries has a history of making predictions which end up being off by eye-wateringorders of magnitude).  Some media sources blatantly misstated fact – theBBC, for instance, conflated “payment” with “transaction” in their headline.Futurism led with “The Average Bitcoin Transaction Wastes a Full Swimming Pool of Water, Scientists Say” – note the use of the words “waste” and “scientists.” TheIndependent chose the unhelpfully vague “Bitcoin consumes as much water as all the baths in Britain, study claims.” Pretty much all reporting confused “study” with “comment” – the former tends to be peer reviewed, the latter hardly ever. This is either lazy or intentionally misleading.  Mercifully, a handful of eloquent individuals with a hard-won understanding of Bitcoin mining and climate issues have sprung into action, detailing the errors. If you don’t already, I strongly recommend followingDaniel Batten andMagdalena (Mags) Gronowska on X – two analysts with plenty of industry experience who have done the relevant research without bias and have understood the potential.  Like I said above, it’s up to all of us now to fight back on this. It shouldn’t be hard, in that facts are on our side. It will require a lot of effort, though. As we have unfortunately seen over the past few years, the disinformation machine is increasingly powerful, in crypto and many other areas. It’s a worthy struggle, though, not just for Bitcoin but also for science and a pushback against what increasingly looks like a post-truth media environment.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING | RESEARCH,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/12/05/why-are-people-spreading-falsehoods-about-bitcoins-water-use,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dc45325fd0d2cb766b1bdd4636e52d2fd241b7a8-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409269,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcFbB8,1701804146,New Binance CEO Evasive in First Marquee Interview Since Getting One of the Biggest Jobs in Crypto,"New Binance CEO Richard Teng's debut on center stage was a bit bumpy.  In his first public interview since getting the job last month after founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao was formed to step down amid a $4.3 billion legal settlement with the U.S. government, Teng said Binance’s compliance systems were inadequate in the past and that mistakes were made. But Teng, who has held senior positions at Binance for several years, refused to give answers about the company’s governance.  Moderator Scott Chipolina, The Financial Times’ digital assets correspondent, repeatedly asked Teng simple questions about Binance, which Teng seemed to avoid answering. While Chipolina was in London, Teng appeared remotely via video.  “I've asked you where Binance’s global headquarters is, I've asked you whether Binance is going to undergo an audit, how many employees the company currently has on its books and whether you're applying for a license in the UK, which is what Binance told us during our last FT crypto conference. You haven’t answered those questions,” Chipolina said after repeatedly trying to get an answer from Teng.  “I have answered each and every one of those questions,” said Teng, who seemed to lose patience.  “Can you tell me where Binance’s headquarters are?” he was asked again.  “It is under consideration,” Teng responded.  Even when asked about the future of Binance, and how the company will change under its new leadership, the new CEO remained vague. “A lot of things will change,” he said before starting to talk about the landscape of the industry.  Teng became the new head of the exchange a few weeks ago after its founder and former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao stepped down from the position following a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, which had accused the exchange of breaking sanctions and money-transmitting laws.  Teng started his interview with what seemed to be a prewritten statement, saying that “mistakes were made” and that the compliance control that Binance had in place was “inadequate” for its size. Going forward, the exchange wants to be a “user-led” as well as a “compliance-led” organization, Teng said in his remarks.  When asked if the exchange would undergo an audit soon, he said that because Binance is a private company and is not raising any funds publicly, it is “not obligated to disclose those facts,” but that its auditors have that information.  “Well, I’m not sure if that answers the question directly,” Chopolina said, asking again if the company is going to undergo an audit.  “We have been undergoing audits in all the regulated jurisdictions that we are in,” Teng said, but when asked to name a specific auditor, he wouldn’t do so.  At the end of the interview, Chopolina gave Teng one more chance to answer a few of the questions about Binance’s governance in order to ensure more transparency for users.  “Can I just check with you, why do you feel so entitled to those answers?” Teng said, slowly starting to show an attitude.  “Well, Binance is the biggest crypto exchange and it’s important that we know that,” Chopolina said.  “It is,” Teng said. “And we are accountable to our users and users knowing that we are totally accountable to them.”  Read more: Richard Teng: Steering Binance in a New Era of Compliance",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/12/05/new-binance-ceo-evasive-in-first-marquee-interview-since-getting-one-of-the-biggest-jobs-in-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a39bb8d9a61815e356b23f29a056a09a43696412-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409267,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcFb4W,1701799388,IBM Introduces New Cold Storage Tech for Crypto Assets,"IBM has released a cryptographic signing technology for handling digital assets in cold storage, reducing the risk associated with manual procedures while keeping assets at arm's-length from an internet connection.  The tech giant - often called the Big Blue - said in a statement on Tuesday that its IBM Hyper Protect Offline Signing Orchestrator (OSO) helps protect high-value transactions by offering additional security layers, including disconnected network operations, time-based security and electronic transaction approval by multiple stakeholders.  In recent years, IBM has quietly been applying its gravitas in key management, specifically its confidential computing suite of technologies, to digital assets and cryptocurrencies.  The limitations of cold storage come down to human interactions, which can take the form of inside jobs, forced attacks – when violence is threatened to have a transaction signed – or other operational errors involving administrators at data centers and simple “pen and paper” approaches, IBM said.  The new OSO tech is being used by IBM’s long-standing partner in the crypto space, Ripple-owned custody firm Metaco.  “IBM’s confidential computing division has been a reliable partner throughout the years, and we are pleased to complement Metaco’s catalog of institutional cold storage solutions with the unique air-gapped cold storage that OSO enables, especially as cold storage requirements are increasingly being stipulated by regulators in markets such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan,” said Metaco CEO Adrien Treccani in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/12/05/ibm-introduces-new-cold-storage-tech-for-crypto-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a0a95d05d6de1363568cd8b28a308ae08eb322ba-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

21088404,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=563953,1701799257,Analyst Says Solana At Risk Of Pullback: Here Is The Target,"An analyst has explained how Solana may be at risk of a correction based on the data of two SOL technical indicators. Solana Has Recently Observed The Formation Of Two Bearish Signals In a new post on X, analyst Ali has discussed why SOL could be at risk of seeing a retracement shortly. The analyst has referred to two technical indicators for the coin: the TD Sequential and RSI. The first of these, the Tom Demark (TD) Sequential, is a metric generally used for spotting probable reversal points in any asset’s price. The indicator has two phases, the first of which is a nine-candles-long “setup” phase. When nine candles of the same polarity are in following a reversal in the price, the TD Sequential setup is said to be complete, and the asset could be assumed to have reached a likely point of a trend shift. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says It’s “Not Too Late” To Buy Ethereum, Here’s Why Naturally, if the candles are green, the setup’s completion would point towards a top, while red candles would imply a bottom formation. Once the setup is over, a thirteen-candles-long countdown phase starts. At the end of these thirteen candles, another probable change of direction happens for the chart. According to Ali, a setup phase has recently formed for Solana. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows this TD Sequential pattern in the weekly price of the cryptocurrency. The trend in the 1-week price of the asset | Source: @ali_charts on X The graph shows that the TD Sequential setup has recently been completed with green candles, implying that the price may have already reversed toward a bearish trend. In the same chart, Ali has also attached the data for the second relevant indicator: the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The RSI is a momentum oscillator that keeps track of the speed and magnitude of the recent changes in an asset’s price. This indicator determines whether the asset is undervalued or overvalued at the moment. When the metric has a value greater than 70, it can be a sign that the asset is overbought, while it being under the 30 mark suggests an oversold condition. As is apparent from the graph, the Solana RSI recently broke above the 70 mark and has remained inside the territory, suggesting that SOL has been overvalued recently. Related Reading: Bitcoin Triumphs Over $41,000, But Here’s What Could Prevent $50,000 This would mean that two bearish signals are looming over the cryptocurrency’s head right now. “A spike in profit-taking could trigger a retracement to $47.6,” says the analyst. From the current price, such a potential correction to $47.6 would mean a drawdown of over 20%. Solana’s fate may yet be averted; however, as the analyst explains, “SOL would have to print a weekly candlestick close above $68.4 to invalidate the bearish outlook and aim for $108.” SOL Price Solana had rallied above the $65 mark yesterday, but the asset has already seen a pullback as it’s now trading around $60.

42419050,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDQOj,1701798995,"Bitcoin ETFs Got BTC Surging, but Tumbling Interest Rates Have Helped, Too","While bitcoin ETFs have frequently been cited for sparking the huge, recent BTC price rally, dramatically lower interest rates are helping, too.  This has bitcoin prices in a place they haven't been in about two years: soaring breathlessly, with some calling for continued gains.  For months, conventional wisdom has been that bitcoin's [BTC] sharp rally, which took its price from $27,000 in early October to above $43,000, was caused by investors enthusiastically betting bitcoin ETFs will soon get approved in the U.S.  And while evidence piles up that those ETFs will get blessed by regulators, something else appears to be at work: Interest rates have plunged in key bond markets, signaling optimism that central banks might soon not just put an end to rate hike cycles, but begin to ease monetary policy.  For instance, yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries are down 8 basis points on Tuesday to 4.18% – leaving them down almost 90 basis points since hitting a 16-year high above 5% in October. The two-year Treasury yield is at 4.60%, down more than 50 basis points from the start of that month.  The big drops came as market participants began to price in an end to the U.S. Federal Reserve's 18-month run of tighter monetary policy. Traders didn't stop at that, though: Short-term rate markets now anticipating that the Fed will start cutting rates as soon as the first quarter of 2024.  There's now about a two-thirds chance of one or more 25-basis-point Fed rate cuts by March 2024, according to the CME FedWatch tool, which draws its data from those short-term rate markets. Going out to May, markets have priced in just shy of a 90% chance of one or more rate cuts, including about a 5% chance of three rate cuts by that time.  To the extent that sharply tighter monetary policy throughout 2022 was a factor in bitcoin's major bear market that year, now-entrenched expectations of easier policy in 2024 are surely playing a role in this bull move. And it's not just bitcoin.  Read more: U.S. CPI Unexpectedly Flat in October; Bitcoin Adds Nearly 1%  The 180-degree turn in the rate outlook is lifting assets across the board. In addition to the big rally in the bond market, the stock market in November (as represented by the S&P 500) had its 18th-best monthly performance since 1950, according to Carson Group's Ryan Detrick, returning 8.9% over those 30 days.  Gold, oft-mentioned in the same breath as bitcoin for its properties as a hedge against easy (or overly easy) central bank monetary policy, has been on the move as well, rising more than 10% since the start of October, and touching a new all-time high above $2,100 per ounce earlier this week.  So, it seems prospective bitcoin ETFs and rates optimism have bitcoin in a place it hasn't been in about two years: soaring breathlessly and with many hopeful for continued gains.

42419044,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDQJZ,1701796790,"House's McHenry Says He Won't Seek Reelection, Costing Crypto a Top Ally","Patrick McHenry, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee that has been leading crypto legislation efforts in the House, said 2024 will be his final year in Congress.  His departure leaves some uncertainty for two key crypto bills that are facing potential House floor votes, though McHenry will still be around next year when they're expected to be considered for approval.  Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), arguably the crypto industry's most important advocate in the U.S. Congress, has decided not to seek another term, he announced in a post on X on Tuesday.  As McHenry, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, continues to shepherd two significant pieces of digital assets legislation toward floor votes in the House of Representatives, his decision could set a clock on getting that task accomplished. Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.), the chair of that panel's crypto-focused subcommittee, has already indicated that progress on the bills – one to regulate U.S. stablecoin issuers and one to establish rules for the wider crypto markets – will shift into the first months of next year.  ""I will be retiring from Congress at the end of my current term,"" McHenry said, confirming news first reported by Politico. ""I believe there is a season for everything and – for me – this season has come to an end. I look forward to what comes next for my family and me.""  McHenry has been a central GOP negotiator for the stablecoin bill, which had nearly reached the finish line in talks with Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the committee's ranking Democrat. Waters has indicated she's still willing to finish the work, and that legislation is widely seen as the most likely to win approval and potentially find success in the Democrat-controlled Senate.  The coming departure of the influential North Carolina lawmaker, famous for his bowties and known for a willingness to make pragmatic deals across the aisle, marks another twist in a political career that in recent weeks saw him suddenly ascend to the role as the House's acting speaker after his colleagues fired Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).  ""We have appreciated McHenry's approach to coalition building, willingness to work in a bipartisan nature and constructive engagement with industry,"" said Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, in a Tuesday statement. ""He will be noticeably missed in Congress.""  McHenry, who was facing the end of his tenure as committee chairman, will have until January of 2025 to complete his term. When a lawmaker announces he's leaving Congress, it can sometimes diminish his or her authority in negotiations.  “Chairman McHenry is a stalwart champion of innovation and the digital asset industry,"" said Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith. ""His bipartisan approach to commonsense rules that improve the status quo and ensure that this technology develops on American soil is a prudent model for Congress as it considers future crypto-specific legislation. While we’re sad to see such an industry champion leave the House, we’re pleased to be able to work closely with the congressman for another 13 months.”  The industry still has a number of supporters among House Republicans, including Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) and Hill. But it also has powerful critics on the Senate side, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.

""As with all of their activities, banks engaging with the crypto-asset sector are expected to do so in a manner that is safe and sound."" A focus of the Federal Reserve's recently created novel activities supervision program is on the supervision of risks posed by a number of technology-driven activities at banks that involve crypto assets, distributed ledger technology, and partnerships with nonbank fintechs. These activities do offer some upgrades to the banking sector (that is, lower costs, increased efficiencies and increased access to financial products and services), Gibson said in opening remarks prepared for a Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion Subcommittee hearing. But there are a slew of risks that must be manageable. ""For example, banks with a high concentration in crypto-asset-related deposits may face heightened liquidity risks, given the significant volatility and interconnectedness in the sector, and should appropriately manage such risk,"" he said before the subcommittee. 11:55 AM ET : Hearing ends. Update at 11:39 AM ET : Gibson said it would be appropriate to ""scale up"" the number of examiners at the Fed should technology-driven activities at banks become more mainstream.

42419038,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDQEP,1701790470,"Binance's Multi-Billion CFTC Penalty Was 'Heightened,' Says Commissioner Kristin Johnson","Multi-billion dollar penalties levied by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) against crypto exchange Binance were ""heightened"" because of the regulator's prior public warnings for crypto firms to comply, Commissioner Kristin Johnson said during a Tuesday event hosted by the Financial Times.  Johnson clarified that the agency took enforcement action against the world's largest crypto exchange because it ""simply failed to comply with regulation.""  Binance made headlines last month for paying one of the largest fines in corporate history. The firm agreed to pay $4.3 billion to the CFTC, the Department of Justice and other U.S. government agencies over money laundering and other charges.  As part of the deal, Binance agreed to pay $1.35 billion in civil penalties and another $1.35 billion in disgorgement to the CFTC to settle a March suit, which argued it operated an unlicensed crypto derivatives trading platform in the U.S. and tried to hide it from regulators. Binance Founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao stepped down as part of the deal and paid a $150 million fine to the agency.  ""There's a common assumption that enforcement actions in the crypto or digital assets ecosystem connote bad actors or bad conduct. Admittedly, there is plenty of evidence to support this assumption,"" Johnson said, but added that, in Binance's case, ""the matter and the resolution of the litigation did not involve any allegation of fraud or similar misconduct.""  Instead, the agency's action against Binance, and later three DeFi platforms in September, was about rule-breaking, she added.  She did, however, say that the agency has a ""deep and careful"" methodology before deciding civil penalties and that Binance's penalties were ""heightened"" mostly because the agency has been ""on record and publicly saying, if you come to U.S. markets and operate, inviting U.S. customers to participate, you have to comply.""  Despite the string of 2022 bankruptcies that rattled the crypto world, the industry has largely criticized U.S. regulators for taking tough action against firms they believe aren't compliant with the country's rules without providing any clarity on how to comply.  ""We are excited for market participants to operate our market, but it's critical that if you're operating in our markets, that you are complying with regulation,"" Johnson said.",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/12/05/binances-multi-billion-cftc-penalty-was-heightened-says-commissioner-kristin-johnson,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9092ca26b37278c4101ac6b14a216168e4d36ce5-3226x1814.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

21084148,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=563838,1701788437,"Warning Signals Flash As Bitcoin Surges: Expert Spotlights Potential $25,000 Liquidity Sweep","Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s leading cryptocurrency, has recently witnessed a surge in price, reaching a new yearly high of $42,100 on Monday. However, this significant price increase has raised concerns among market participants about the possibility of a potential correction and a subsequent liquidation sweep, which could drive the price down to as low as $25,000. Second Capitulation And Liquidity Sweep For Bitcoin? Justin Bennett, a prominent technical analysis expert, acknowledges the remarkable performance of Bitcoin, stating, “It’s been a hell of a run from BTC, and it may very well continue without a significant correction in the short term.” However, Bennett highlights that the previous two bear markets concluded with a second capitulation, suggesting the possibility of a similar scenario occurring this time. Bennet cautions against ruling out a liquidity sweep that could drive the price down to $25,000. Related Reading: Analyzing The Titans: How Bitcoin Whales Influenced The Surge To $40,000 To provide further context, liquidity sweep refers to a sudden and drastic move in price that aims to clear out excess leverage and trigger liquidations of overleveraged positions. Such a move could lead to a cascading effect, causing the price to drop further as more positions get forcefully closed. The occurrence of a liquidity sweep at the $25,000 level would not only test the resilience of Bitcoin but also serve as a crucial moment for market sentiment. As seen in the 2-week chart above shared by Bennet, despite the potential correction in BTC, this could be the last difficulty that Bitcoin bulls experience before the continuation of the bull run; this will be further fueled by the potential approval of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) applications by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is expected to push prices even higher. A boost from the halving of Bitcoin will further add to the bullish momentum and sentiment in the market, which could push the price of BTC to new all-time highs (ATH). Additionally, historical trends indicate a promising outlook for Bitcoin. Analyst Ali Martinez points out that in the past, strong BTC performance during October and November has been followed by a bullish December. According to Martinez, market participants can anticipate a bullish December ahead if this pattern holds. El Salvador’s BTC Investments Prove Profitable El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele recently announced that the nation’s investments in Bitcoin have yielded significant profits, refuting previous claims of losses made by critics. President Bukele revealed that if El Salvador were to sell its Bitcoin holdings at the current market price, the country would not only fully recover its initial investment but also make a profit of $3,620,277.13. Addressing the numerous articles and hit pieces that had ridiculed El Salvador’s Bitcoin investment strategy, President Bukele emphasized that these assessments were based on the cryptocurrency’s market price at the time of evaluation. With Bitcoin’s recent surge in value, the country’s investment has turned profitable. Related Reading: Ethereum Turns Deflationary With Over 106,000 ETH Burned In A Single Month While acknowledging that the price of Bitcoin will continue to fluctuate, President Bukele reaffirmed that El Salvador remains committed to its long-term strategy and has no intention of selling its Bitcoin holdings. President Bukele stated: Of course, we have no intention of selling; that has never been our objective. We are fully aware that the price will continue to fluctuate in the future, this doesn’t affect our long-term strategy. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $41,200, reflecting a notable price increase of 3.8% over the past 24 hours and 12% over the past seven days.

42419033,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDQ8D,1701788400,Pyth Oracle Network Brings Industry Heavyweights Into Governance Post-Airdrop,"Pyth, an oracle service that provides low-latency pricing data to blockchains, distributed its new PYTH governance tokens to more than 90,000 crypto wallets in November. The token was introduced as a way to decentralize Pyth's governance process – a system that will allow token-holders to vote on how the platform evolves.  As the result of a ""strategic fundraising"" round announced this week, some of the crypto industry's largest players – including some big-name venture firms and market makers – could soon have a loud voice in this new system. The Pyth Data Association, a Swiss non-profit focused on Pyth development, told CoinDesk this week that it has raised funds from crypto heavyweights including Castle Island Ventures, Multicoin Capital, Wintermute Ventures, Borderless Capital, CMT Digital, Bodhi Ventures, Distributed Global and Delphi Digital.  Michael Cahill, the CEO of Pyth developer Duoro Labs and a director of the Pyth Data Association, said in an interview that the new partners all received allotments of PYTH tokens – the assets that double as votes in the protocol's governance system. Cahill declined to specify how much money the Data Association had raised in the round, but the Data Association's new funders could potentially use their PYTH tokens to influence how the platform develops moving forward.  ""This round expands the Pyth community to new stakeholders and individuals dedicated to advancing decentralized capital markets,"" the Pyth Data Association said in a statement. ""New stakeholders will help the network grow through enhanced access to new capital sources, participation in governance and protocol improvements, and strategic guidance.""  The Data Association's new partners are ""excited about being able to shape the direction of Pyth and being able to drive this from a truly decentralized perspective,"" Cahill said in the interview.  Pyth, which launched on the Solana blockchain in 2021 and has since expanded to 45 blockchains, currently services 25% of all applications that use oracles, according to Cahill. Oracles are critical pieces of blockchain infrastructure that shepherd real-world data (in Pyth's case, price data for stocks, commodities and currencies – both fiat and the crypto kind) onto blockchains.  Unlike Chainlink, the current leader in oracles, Pyth sources its data directly from first-party financial firms (and many Pyth contributors rank among the biggest firms in trading) rather than third parties. This direct-from-the-source data gathering, combined with other elements of Pyth's architecture, is designed to give the protocol a leg up in terms of overall speed – a key differentiator that could help Pyth eat away at Chainlink's dominant market position, and could bring sluggish crypto markets further-in line with the demands of modern finance.  Pyth was incubated by Jump Crypto, the crypto arm of Jump, a major Chicago-based trading firm. It spun out into an independent entity mid-year with the establishment of Duoro Labs, which is currently exclusively focused on the development of the Pyth protocol, according to Cahill.",POSITIVE,PYTH,BLOCKCHAIN | LINK | MARKET | TRADING | PYTH,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/12/05/pyth-oracle-network-brings-industry-heavyweights-into-governance-post-airdrop,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a7213529b64306c22f1498b258903ff562fbba7-1600x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Over 8 Billion Shiba Inu Burned In The Last 24 Hours According to data from the burn tracking website Shibburn, over 8 billion Shiba Inu tokens have been burned in the last 24 hours. As a result of this record, the burn rate jumped by 7424294.41%. Interestingly, one transaction accounted for the bulk of the tokens burned, with 8,241,856,589 SHIB transferred to a dead wallet. Source: Shibburn This development continues a recent trend that has SHIB’s burn rate continuing to spike. Sometime last week, the token’s burn rate rose by 499,416% in a single day, with over 264.2 million SHIB tokens burned. This came after 2.7 million SHIB tokens had just been burned the previous day. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cycle Analysis And Macro Factors Reveal When Price Will Reach $125,000 Meanwhile, the single transaction that led to 8.2 billion SHIB tokens being burned was due to the spike in network activity on Shibarium. Shiba Inu’s developer, Kaal Dhairya, noted in an X post that the layer-2 network experienced a continuous rise in gas fees, which led to exponential growth in the burn rate. Shibarium’s Role In SHIB’s Burn Rate Shibarium’s significant role in the Shiba Inu burn rate has become evident. Notably, the Shibarium allocates a portion (70%) of the network’s base fees for SHIB burns. The spike in SHIB’s burn rate is expected to be on the rise even as Shibarium continues to enjoy greater adoption. Shiba Inu’s Marketing Lead, Lucie, had once urged the community to use Shibarium so that more SHIB could be burned. SHIB community members seem to be now heeding her advice as the number of transactions on the network has skyrocketed recently. The layer-2 network is reported to have witnessed a transaction count spike of more than 47,000% in less than a week. In that period, Shibarium has surpassed the milestones of 5 million, 10 million, and 20 million in rapid succession. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Bitcoin 400% Surge To $200,000, Here’s When Shibarium doesn’t seem to be slowing down anytime soon, as the total transaction count currently stands at over 35 million at the time of writing. The SHIB community will be hoping that this run continues as it is undoubtedly bullish for the meme coin’s price. In an update posted on the Shib Blog, the correlation between Shibaroum’s transaction volume, gas fees, and Shiba Inu burns was resounded. The author noted that the burn rate would continue to grow exponentially as Shibarium experiences an increase in the number of transactions and a significant increase in gas fees.

21082092,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=563967,1701783017,Shiba Inu Set To Establish A New Era For Shibarium Burns,"Popular blockchain project Shiba Inu has revealed a new era of token burns for its Ethereum-based layer 2 blockchain solution, Shibarium. Shiba Inu Unveils Latest Burning Mechanism On Monday, December 4, Shiba Inu announced a fresh set of burning techniques to increase the ecosystem token’s value. According to the announcement, the team described the new mechanism as a “transformative” move, crucial for the network’s economic model. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Soars Over 3,000% – What’s The Impact On Price? The purpose of this technique is to intentionally reduce the token supply in order to increase the value of SHIB and its ecosystem. The announcement read: Shibarium is introducing a transformative token burning mechanism, crucial for the network’s economic model. This mechanism is designed to reduce token supply strategically, potentially increasing the token’s value and benefiting its ecosystem. The burn mechanism has been divided into two distinct phases. These include the Manual phase and the Automated Transition phase. The Manual phase will see the token burn managed by the official deployer wallet. This makes it possible to observe and adjust closely to ensure alignment with the network’s sustainability and health. Several changes will be made during the Automated Transition phase to improve dependability and efficiency. According to the Shiba Inu team, the previous mechanism will transit into an automated system. The burn process for this phase will function according to predetermined guidelines, making it more transparent and efficient. However, this automated aspect is expected to begin in January next year. So far, the first-ever token burn performed by the Shiba Inu team saw about 8.2 billion SHIB tokens burned, valued at approximately $76,000. The team will keep burning tokens manually using its deployer wallet to represent user engagement on Shibarium. Shiba Inu’s latest Shibarium burn mechanism underscores a “major milestone” for the network’s development, according to the official blog post. Shibarium is establishing a standard in blockchain token economics by coordinating token burning with network utilization and constantly improving the procedure through updates. Shibarium’s Transactions Increases Significantly Lately, Shibarium has seen a surge in transactions and a sharp increase in gas fees by up to 1,000%. Due to this, the token burning has increased exponentially. This is because an increase in the network’s usage leads to more tokens getting burned. Related Reading: Shibarium Transactions Spike 288%, But Why Is Shiba Inu Price Down Today? Shibarium has grown purposefully to surpass its best since its introduction in early August. Several weeks ago, there were only a few thousand transactions each day, but today, there are on average 7 million. According to data from Shibarium Explorer, that number is currently at 7.82 million. The total number of transactions has also increased lately, totaling 36,730,230 as of the time of writing.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  BlackRock (BLK) received $100,000 as “seed capital” for its proposed spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund, the investment giant disclosed in a fresh application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). “The seed capital investor agreed to purchase $100,000 in shares on October 27, 2023, and on October 27, 2023 took delivery of 4,000 shares at a per-share price of $25.00 (the “seed shares”),” the filing said. Seed capital represents the initial funding that allows an ETF to fund the creation units underlying the ETF so that shares can be offered and traded in the open market.  Business intelligence company MicroStrategy (MSTR) was sitting on a more than $2 billion profit on its massive bitcoin (BTC) holdings on Monday following the cryptocurrency’s rally above $42,000. Led by then CEO and now Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy began purchasing bitcoin in August 2020. The company's most recent purchases took place last month and as of Nov. 30, it held 174,530 bitcoin acquired for $5.28 billion, or an average price of $30,252 each. With bitcoin at $42,000, the value of MSTR's holdings rose to roughly $7.3 billion. The price at press time had pulled back to $41,700.  The president of El Salvador took to the X platform early Monday morning to note his country's bitcoin (BTC) investment was now profitable by more than $3 million following the cryptocurrency's rally. ""We have no intention of selling; that has never been our objective,"" he wrote. ""We are fully aware that the price will continue to fluctuate in the future, this doesn’t affect our long-term strategy."" Based on public statements from Nayib Bukele, CoinDesk three weeks ago calculated that the country at that time owned roughly 2,744 bitcoins at an average price a bit lower than $42,000 and was sitting on a loss of about $16 million.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows changes in short-term and long-term bitcoin call-put skews over the past five weeks. The metric measures demand for calls relative to puts.  Skews have come off from multimonth highs reached in early November, failing to confirm bitcoin's rise above $42,000 on Monday.  Perhaps sophisticated traders are anticipating a bull breather.  A call option offers protection against bullish moves, while a put offers insurance against price slides.

Other regulators and advisers are encouraging a bespoke and global approach to crypto.  The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) is not afraid to bring enforcement actions against crypto companies that do not follow its rules, Superintendent Adrienne Harris said at a Financial Times event on Tuesday.  The regulator has taken action against some of the biggest names in crypto. In January, the Coinbase (COIN) exchange had to pay a $50 million fine to settle NYDFS charges that it allowed users to set up accounts without conducting sufficient background checks. Last year, trading platform Robinhood (HOOD) was fined $30 million for allegedly violating anti-money laundering and cybersecurity regulations.  ""So we've really spent a lot of time doing what I call when I first came into office, a tone reset, to say you are regulated, here are the expectations, here are the rules, and when you don't follow them, we will bring enforcement actions,"" said Harris.  Crypto exchange Binance recently reached a record-setting deal with U.S. regulators to settle charges that it served U.S. customers without the right approvals and allowed citizens to process transactions with customers in sanctioned regions.  ""We've been talking about the illicit finance component of cryptocurrencies. I think that's going to continue and attention on that is going to be heightened as a result of Binance and some of the other cases that have been brought by DOJ and other authorities around the world,"" Harris said, referring to the U.S. Department of Justice.  Across the globe, regulators have been working out how best to oversee the crypto sector, and the European Union has put into law the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation – a broad set of rules for the digital asset industry that can apply across its 27 members, something some worry legitimizes crypto.  ""Well, there isn't actually anything illegitimate about crypto. It is just a technology. It is a way to keep records. Rather than in a centralized entity, they have a shared ledger, so there is nothing illegitimate about it,"" Peter Kerstens, an adviser at the European Commission, said during the same panel. ""You can do an awful lot of illegitimate things with that technology, and we'll try to moderate and regulate for that.""  U.K. Parliamentarian Lisa Cameron, who sat on the same panel, asked for global standards for crypto to be put in place.  ""I think there has to be that sort of level of interoperability, as they say, and this kind of baseline of standards and then other jurisdictions will place other sort of aspects on top of that, but I think that's something that we all need to really work towards,"" Cameron said.

21080024,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=563926,1701777624,"XRP Price Set To Skyrocket 1,100% On This Signal: Crypto Analyst","In crypto trading, history often repeats itself, or at least rhymes. That’s why it can be crucial to spot historically important price signals and patterns. A recent technical analysis by Egrag Crypto has spotlighted such a pattern for XRP, indicating a possible massive price increase. This analysis hinges on the observation of a bullish crossover between the 21 Exponential Moving Average (21 EMA) and the 55 Moving Average (55 MA) in the 2-week chart of XRP/USD. Egrag states, “XRP Rockets: 21 EMA & 55 MA Signal Explosion: Let’s decode the XRP trajectory – my focus? Just two pivotal weekly candles after the crossover between 21 EMA & 55MA.” Will The XRP Price Soar To $7? The chart provided by Egrag Crypto highlights the XRP price movements in the two distinct scenarios when this rare bullish signal occurred. The first bullish crossover of the 21 EMA and 55 MA in the 2-week chart occurred in March 2017 (scenario A). Following this signal, the XRP price saw “two striking 2-week candles. The initial one surged by around 90%, trailed by an electrifying 1100% spike,” Egrag remarked. Related Reading: XRP Lawsuit: Full History, News, Schedule And Price Predictions For the second time in the history of the XRP price, the signal flashed at the end of December 2020. This time, the XRP rose by 100% in the first candle, succeeded by an 84% surge in the second 2-week candle which marked a collective 200% upswing. According to the crypto analyst, there’s a high probability that these scenarios will repeat themselves. “Drawing parallels from past bullish runs, my opinion syncs with historical data,” Egrag remarked. Notably, the chart of Egrag also features an ascending trend line, a bullish indicator, which XRP has tested twice, as shown by the two green circles in mid-2022 and early 2023. These taps on the trend line are critical, as they suggest that each touch is a test of support where the price finds enough buyers to begin a new upward movement. Related Reading: XRP Price Set To Explode: Analyst Identifies Trigger For Next Parabolic Move The analyst speculates that XRP could dip slightly more to tap the ascending trend line a third time, which could be a precursor to a significant price rally. This potential third tap on the trend line is viewed as a buying opportunity that could precede a considerable price surge. Following this third retest of the trend line, Egrag expects two possible scenarios based on the bullish crossover of the 21 EMA and 55 MA. In scenario A, the crypto analyst envisions a dramatic rise in the XRP price, projecting a target of $7.00, which would represent a staggering increase of 1,139.35% from the current price. Scenario B suggests a more conservative target of $1.80, which would still be an impressive gain of 218.82%. The “No Return Zone,” marked in red at the $1.80 level, is set just above scenario B’s target. It indicates a critical threshold that could either act as a resistance zone or confirm a strong bullish momentum if the price sustains above it. Broader Market Forces The crypto analyst is also aware that the Bitcoin price traditionally plays a major role for altcoins such as XRP. He therefore notes on the current market conditions, “eyes fixed on BTC as the majority anticipates a $48K-$50K peak, potentially followed by a pullback, igniting a widespread alt season. Yet, what’s intriguing? A scenario where BTC skyrockets to ATH, retraces, and unleashes a truly wild alt season.” The analyst’s perspective leans towards an initial spike to between $7 to $10, followed by a significant retracement, and then an even more substantial rise to the levels of $20 to $30. On being queried about the extent of the expected retracement from the $7-$10 range, Egrag Crypto answered an “aggressive $1.3-1.5” drawdown. At press time, XRP traded at $0.61095.

A number of factors could support returns going forward, including the upcoming halving, looser monetary policy, and potential ETF approvals. A broad range of assets have moved significantly in response to an expectation of no further rate rises. In the short term, this move appears overdone. Bitcoin has a history of price momentum though, and the recent move may be nearing a point where price and demand create a positive feedback loop. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has demonstrated considerable strength over the past 12 months, despite relatively tight financial conditions and elevated economic and geopolitical uncertainty. This strength could be attributed to the next halving approaching in 2024, stimulative fiscal policy or an expectation of looser monetary policy. I had previously suggested that Bitcoin’s price was likely to face pressure from quantitative tightening. This proved to be completely wrong, as the Fed has done little to reduce liquidity in 2023 and expectations of interest rate cuts are rising. The potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF is also possible providing support, with speculation rising in anticipation of increased institutional demand. Large asset managers, like BlackRock and Fidelity, have submitted Bitcoin spot ETF applications to the SEC. Grayscale is also trying to convert its Bitcoin trust into a spot ETF. A decision regarding potential approval is expected to come in early January . Halving Bitcoin's next halving is approaching in early 2024, which again raises the question of whether there is a causal relationship between halvings and Bitcoin's price. I have written about this previously , although I am not convinced that halvings are particularly important. Figure 1: Bitcoin Price (source: Created by author using data from blockchain.com) At the margin, a reduction in new supply could help to create price momentum, which goes on to form a positive feedback loop between price and demand. Investors should bear in mind that the supply of new Bitcoin is now low relative to the total existing supply. Given that the halving is a known event, rational investors should be expected to front-run the halving, and yet price has generally followed the halving rather than preceding it. Supply is only part of the equation though, and given the fixed production schedule of Bitcoin, demand is likely a more important driver of price. Both supply and demand based models can be constructed to predict Bitcoin's price, which I have detailed here . While these models appear accurate based on past data, I don't have much confidence in their predictive power. Figure 2: Bitcoin Value Estimate (source: Created by author using data from blockchain.com) Financial Conditions I tend to think that the general macro environment is more important than the supply of new Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a risk-on asset, and in the past has tended to behave like a liquidity proxy. With this being the case, an easing of monetary policy could be a catalyst for a sustained move higher. The rapid rise in long-term interest rates in 2021 and 2022 likely contributed to the recent bear market. Given the extent to which monetary policy was tightened, and how much growth stocks were impacted, Bitcoin’s price actually held up surprisingly well. Figure 3: Bitcoin Price and 10 Year Treasury Yields (source: Created by author using data from blockchain.com and The Federal Reserve) While the Fed rapidly raised interest rates over the past 18 months to try and reduce inflation, markets have never really bought into the higher for longer narrative. The yield curve slope has been highly inverted for the better part of a year and a half, which could be interpreted as predicting a recession, or simply that rates cannot be sustained at current levels due to the amount of debt in the economy. In recent years, Bitcoin has tended to move higher when the yield curve has been steepening and move lower when the yield curve slope has been falling. While this could be related to expectations of future economic conditions, I believe it is primarily due to the impact of liquidity. Figure 4: Bitcoin Price and Treasury Yield Slope (source: Created by author using data from blockchain.com and The Federal Reserve) Bitcoin has tended to move in tandem with liquidity over the past few years, although Bitcoin has moved higher in 2023 while liquidity has remained fairly flat. I don't think liquidity will increase significantly without a substantial deterioration in economic conditions, but this doesn't appear to be a problem at the moment. Figure 5: Bitcoin Price and Liquidity (source: Created by author using data from blockchain.com and The Federal Reserve) The Chicago Fed’s National Financial Conditions Index is another measure that indicates easing financial conditions have been driving Bitcoin's returns. This index was created to help demonstrate the relative tightness of financial conditions when the Fed funds rate is zero. It measures financial conditions in US money markets, debt and equity markets, and the traditional and “shadow” banking systems. It includes inputs related to market depth, yield spreads and volatility, amongst others. During normal periods, Bitcoin's price is uncorrelated with this index, but when the financial conditions index changes rapidly, Bitcoin's price also tends to move sharply. While Bitcoin's recent move higher may seem significant in isolation, it appears to primarily be the result of a rapid easing of financial conditions. Figure 6: Financial Conditions and Bitcoin Returns (source: Created by author using data from Blockchain.com and The Federal Reserve) Conclusion Investors finally seem to be realizing that inflation is returning to relatively low levels, and as a result, the expectation is now that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in 2024. The subsequent easing of financial conditions has had a dramatic impact on a number of assets, including Bitcoin. While a ""soft landing"" could be a boon for Bitcoin, a deterioration in macro conditions is likely to be a negative, as investors will seek safe havens. This may be short lived though, as a rapid loosening of monetary policy in response to economic weakness would likely drive Bitcoin higher. Outside of factors impacting crypto as an asset class, innovation in terms of things like scalability and programmability tends to be greater on other blockchains. Longer-term, Bitcoin continues to face the prospect of declining financial security as its block reward declines. For these reasons, I find it difficult to be bullish regarding Bitcoin's prospects, outside of it being a speculative financial asset. Given the confluence of Bitcoin’s halving, a potential easing of monetary policy and the prospect of a Bitcoin ETF driving institutional demand, Bitcoin’s price could be set to move higher. The recent price rise across a range of assets could suggest the current run is overdone, although speculating on short-term price moves is a difficult task. Ultimately, I think Bitcoin continues to move higher in the long run, albeit with far lower returns than in the past.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4655999-bitcoin-liquidity-proxy?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/21080059.jpeg

According to CoinShares’ latest report on digital asset investment funds, inflows into crypto products totaled $176 million last week, bringing the total inflow in 10 weeks to $1.76 billion. The timing is not a coincidence, as most cryptocurrencies turned green again last week in terms of price action. Total Crypto Inflows Hit $1.76 Billion In 10 Weeks After a lackluster action for most of the year and some weeks of net outflows, the most recent data shows smart money investors are betting big on crypto again. Investments in digital asset funds have been on the rise for the past two months, ignited by the crypto market bull run which started in the middle of October. As a result, the inflows have ballooned every week, breaking levels not seen since 2021’s crypto market bull run. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Rallies To 4-Month Highs – Can Bulls Take It Above $0.3? Digital asset investment funds ended November with an inflow of $176 million, although down from the $346 million registered in the week before. Most of the money last week went into Bitcoin, with the cryptocurrency seeing $133 million in inflows. Bitcoin remains the most popular digital asset for institutions, and interest has really piqued with the applications of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US waiting for approval from regulators. As a result, the crypto has strengthened since October, breaking various price levels and resistances, the latest being the $42,000 price level. The sentiment has also flowed into the altcoin market. Ethereum saw inflows of $31 million last week, bringing its 5-week inflow run to a total of $134 million. Multi-asset investment products that provide exposure to a basket of crypto assets saw $2.3 million in new investment. Total market cap at $1.5 trillion | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com Solana and XRP saw inflows of $4.3 million and $0.5 million respectively. On the other hand, Litecoin saw outflows of $0.2 million, and Short Bitcoin products saw $3.6 million inflows after three consecutive weeks of outflows. Most of the inflows came in from Canada, Germany, and the US, which saw inflows of $79 million, $57 million, and $54 million respectively. Australia and Sweden also saw outflows of $0.5 million and $0.2 million respectively. However, the overall trend shows institutions are still bullish on crypto in the long run.

Assets under management have also risen by 107% this year and are now at $46.2 billion, but still below the $86.6 billion seen in 2021.

The total amount of capital locked or staked across all decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols reached $50 billion on Tuesday for the first time in six months as the value of underlying assets surged and investors sought to secure a yield on their crypto holdings.  Data from DefiLlama shows that since Oct. 13, when the sector was at multiyear lows, the figure has increased by $15 billion.  The search for yield was illustrated last week, when Blast, a newly announced layer 2 project that hopes to go live next year, received more than $700 million in deposits from traders and investors who were unperturbed by the fact that assets cannot be withdrawn until at least March.  Since Oct. 13, ether [ETH], the primary asset used across the DeFi market, has risen by 42%, outpacing the whole DeFi market, which increased by 41%. It's worth noting that a significant portion of DeFi protocols offer yields on stablecoins, which are pegged to traditional fiat currencies like the dollar, euro or sterling.  Transactional volume has also risen: More than $5.4 billion changed hands on a single day last month, the most since March.  The sector experienced a boost earlier this year as a result of Ethereum's shift to a proof-of-stake blockchain, which meant holders could stake ether to become a network validator and receive rewards. The transition spurred the liquid staking market, led by the likes of Lido and RocketPool, which combined are responsible for 45% of DeFi's total value locked (TVL).  Lido currently offers an annual yield of 3.7% whilst RocketPool offers 3.92%. Liquid staking is a form of derivative that allows investors to generate a yield from staking ether whilst receiving a token that can be used elsewhere across the DeFi ecosystem.  TVL on Solana-based protocols marginfi, Jito and Marinade Finance has jumped by between 60% and 120% in the past 30 days as institutional interest around Solana continues to mount. Grayscale's Solana Trust traded at an 869% premium last month, demonstrating significant demand from the institutional market.  Jito, Solana's liquid staking protocol, offers stakers a yield of 6.96%, a level that led to $327 million in inflows since Oct. 13.

Daily Bitcoin production improved to 14.8 in October but was lower year-over-year. There is zero long-term debt, a rare stance in the crypto industry. RIOT faces risks from Bitcoin price volatility and operational challenges. In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency, Riot Platforms, Inc. (RIOT) has cemented it as a pivotal player, particularly in the realm of Bitcoin mining. At times, investors have used the stock's performance as a litmus test for the broader industry. As we delve into Riot's financial and operational performance, especially in the third quarter of 2023, a complex picture of challenges and triumphs unfolds, offering investors a nuanced view of the mining industry begins to come together. On the one hand, we have the exciting prospect of Bitcoin ETFs, the recent crypto surge, and the halving providing tailwinds for the token over the medium term; on the other hand, we have the halving potentially posing challenges for miners (barring a major Bitcoin rally) and the risk of another spike in energy prices driving up production costs. A Snapshot of Q3 2023: Mixed Revenue and Surprising Production Cost Riot's third quarter of 2023 painted a picture of robust growth with total revenues reaching $51.9 million, a noteworthy increase from $46.3 million in the same period last year. This growth trajectory, however, isn't devoid of challenges. Data by YCharts The quarter witnessed an intriguing phenomenon - the average cost to mine Bitcoin was negative, at ($6141), a stark contrast to the previous year. This anomaly primarily stemmed from power curtailment credits, which significantly bolstered Riot's revenue, adding $49.6 million in the quarter. It is important to remember that investors will want the company to secure wins from their core business and not via credits but the memory of the challenges posed to mining companies will still be fresh in everyone's memory, which will likely cause investors to look on recent results with a more understanding approach. Nevertheless, Riot did pull together a good report in October. A cornerstone of their operations is the deployment of 98,694 miners, contributing to a formidable hash rate of 10.9 EH/s. The mining efficiency is also spotlighted, with an average of approximately 12.0 Bitcoins mined per day, totaling 1,106 Bitcoins mined. Riot's core operation, Bitcoin mining, yielded 1106 Bitcoin during Q3 2023. This output, achieved amidst an increasing network difficulty, speaks volumes about the company's operational efficiency and technological advancements. In the recent production update, we can see things are continuing to improve, with average daily production hitting 14.8 Bitcoin per day in October, which shows that the firm is ramping things up, but this is still less than the 16.4 over the same period last year. In other words, we are trending for monthly and quarterly improvements. Metric October 2023 September 2023 October 2022 Bitcoin Produced 458 362 509 Average Bitcoin Produced per Day 14.8 12.1 16.4 Bitcoin Held 7,345 7,327 6,825 Bitcoin Sold 440 340 450 Bitcoin Sales - Net Proceeds $12.5 million $9.0 million $8.7 million Average Net Price per Bitcoin Sold $28,408 $26,379 $19,339 Deployed Hash Rate 11.7 EH/s 10.9 EH/s 6.9 EH/s Deployed Miners 106,674 98,694 65,516 As a low-cost Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) producer, Riot Platforms touts a year-to-date (YTD) direct cost to produce one Bitcoin at $5,537 (this is distinct from the average cost above), which is significantly below the average market value of a Bitcoin. The company's gross margin from Bitcoin mining stands tall at 79%, underscoring its recurring theme of operational efficiency despite market challenges. Additionally, the cost of power, a critical component in mining economics, is competitively priced at $0.017 per kWh. Financially, Riot Platforms maintains a strong liquidity position with a cash balance of $290 million and holds 7,327 Bitcoins, valued at approximately $198 million. Data by YCharts Notably, the company has zero long-term debt, which is particularly noteworthy in an industry often characterized by heavy leverage. Hash Rate Expansion: The Roadmap Ahead Looking forward, Riot's requirements are pretty clear - to ramp up its hash rate significantly. The target of reaching 12.5 exahash per second by the end of 2023 and 20.2 EH/s by mid-2024 underlines a commitment to growth and market dominance. These plans are bolstered by strategic decisions such as the agreement with MicroBT and the optimization of their miner fleet. Such steps not only signify expansion but also reflect an adaptive approach to technological advancements and efficiency enhancements. The challenge with the miners and hash rate growth is how they'll pay for it and the changing costs of production around the halvings. In the past, miners have relied on secondary offerings to fund operations between crypto bull markets. In fact, Riot recently tapped the market in August . The other factor is the halving. Halvings have the potential to destroy or greatly improve the Bitcoin Mining model. In the past, we have seen Bitcoin appreciate at a much higher rate than the loss of reward by halvings. This has lifted the industry. With the upcoming halving, there is a risk of a negative outcome coming to fruition, but Bitcoin's recent move is improving that situation. Data by YCharts We will likely need to see a major improvement to lift miners to profitability, but it is important to note the correlation between these stocks and the token regardless of profitability in the past (as well as Riot's relative performance). Data by YCharts Confronting Risks: A Reality of the Crypto World Despite the promising aspects, Riot's journey has its share of risks and uncertainties. The volatility of Bitcoin prices remains a perpetual concern, adding a layer of unpredictability to the company's revenue streams. Operational threats, such as those associated with mining activities and data center management, also loom large. Furthermore, global economic conditions, regulatory shifts, and technological advancements pose potential challenges that Riot must navigate, which is what creates the high-risk/high-reward opportunity. In fact, we can see earnings have been surprising to the downside recently. Seeking Alpha We can also see that the PS Ratios have somewhat stabilized, which, in effect, turns the stock into a proxy for Bitcoin - which historically hasn't been a bad thing. Data by YCharts The Takeaway As the company navigates the choppy waters of Bitcoin's price volatility and the looming halving event, it demonstrates an unwavering commitment to growth and efficiency. The recent quarter's performance, marked by strong revenue and robust mining output, offers a glimpse into Riot's ability to adapt and thrive despite the industry's inherent challenges. However, the reliance on power curtailment credits to achieve negative mining costs may raise questions among discerning investors about the sustainability of such earnings. The roadmap ahead for Riot is ambitious, with significant hash rate expansions on the horizon. Strategic partnerships and technological advancements are set to bolster the company's position, but how Riot finances this growth amidst the halving's cost pressures will be crucial. The company's history of tapping into markets for funding and the potential impact of the halving on the Bitcoin mining model underscores the importance of strategic financial planning. With Bitcoin's recent positive momentum, the prospects for Riot's continued success seem hopeful, yet contingent on market dynamics. While Riot Platforms Inc. showcases impressive operational and financial fortitude, the reality of risks in the crypto space cannot be ignored. Investors eyeing Riot must weigh the potential for high returns against the backdrop of Bitcoin's volatility, operational risks, and broader economic factors.

Concurrently, the cryptocurrency has managed to break through a significant resistance level against the backdrop of a bullish market attitude. Not only is Cardano seeing a boost in momentum, but top altcoins are also feeling the effects. Strong positions held by Bitcoin and Ethereum above $40,000 and $2,200, respectively, add to the overall favorable market dynamics. Related Reading: ORDI Rockets To Unprecedented Peaks Alongside Bitcoin’s $42,000 Breakthrough Cardano Network Transactions Rise Cardano has been steadily rising, and expert cryptocurrency trader Ali Martinez pointed out that the cryptocurrency’s consolidation in the middle of November resembled that of the 2018–2022 phase. This suggests that Cardano may overcome the $0.45 resistance and reach $0.75 by the end of December. Cardano has had a pivotal three months, and what’s to come could be even more so. This is due to the fact that the network has seen numerous transactions totaling more over $100,000. Martinez claims that the spike in transactions indicates a rise in institutional interest in ADA. #Cardano | In the last three months, there’s been a significant increase in $ADA transactions over $100,000, reaching new highs consistently. This surge points to growing interest in #ADA from institutional players and whales, which is usually a precursor to price spikes. pic.twitter.com/APczM2PGxM — Ali (@ali_charts) December 4, 2023 Meanwhile, there’s another interesting development happening of late. According to the most recent data, once Bitcoin broke above the $41,000 mark, there was a bullish rebound that saw the percentage of lucrative Cardano addresses rise to a two-year high of 42%, or roughly 1.76 million addresses. Source: IntoTheBlock Based on IntoTheBlock’s examination, this increase in profitability not only represents a transient spike but also highlights ADA’s long-term potential. This encouraging development contributes to the general sentiment among investors by fostering a sense of assurance and faith in cryptocurrencies. ADAUSD currently trading at $0.399 territory on the daily chart: TradingView.com Whales’ Influence On ADA’s Price And Sentiment And speaking of sentiment, Martinez emphasized the possible influence on the price of ADA while pointing out that whales have also been participating in the recent large-scale transactions on the Cardano network. The expert noted that actions such as these might be essential to a significant rise in the price of ADA. Source: IntoTheBlock Related Reading: Solana TVL Balloons To Over $600 Million – What This Means For SOL Price The recent announcement of 150 initiatives and the ongoing development of 1,304 projects demonstrate a thriving ecosystem. Another explanation for Cardano’s high transaction growth could be this. The remarkable production of 9.1 million native tokens demonstrates the wide range of customization possibilities on Cardano. A further demonstration of the versatile utility of Cardano’s asset generation capabilities is the establishment of 81,447 token policies. At the time of writing, ADA was trading at $0.399, up 2.3% in the last 24 hours, and down 7.1% in the last seven weeks, data by Coingecko shows.

Per Fairlead Strategies, further gains could be in the offing, as COIN is on track to confirm a long-term base pattern breakout.  Basing involves an asset consolidating in a price range for a prolonged time following a significant sell-off. The energy built up during the consolidation is unleashed in the direction in which the base is breached, that is, to the higher side, in case of a bullish breakout.  “COIN is likely to confirm a long-term base breakout this Friday above near $116 resistance. The breakout is a positive long-term development, suggesting the primary trend has shifted higher,” Fairlead’s analysts team, led by founder and managing partner Katie Stockton, said in a note to clients Monday.  According to analysts, the base breakout has opened doors for a rally toward resistance at $160 and potentially $200.  The chart shows COIN crashed in the first half of 2022, subsequently entering a 15-month-long base formation between $30 and $116.

In a statement released on X, the fund highlighted its investment strategy and reasoning for STX being the best altcoin to long at the moment. “When looking for long ideas, we target those with strong fundamentals, supportive tokenomics, and significant upcoming catalysts. STX stands out with the most compelling catalyst path over the next few months and the greatest chance to rerate,” the fund stated. In-Depth Analysis Of Stacks’ Prospects North Rock Digital’s full thesis, published on Medium, delves into the details underpinning their positive outlook on STX. The thesis asserts, “Key developments have brought our initial STX thesis into further focus demand for Bitcoin block-space has solidified, increasing the demand for the product STX is building.” Related Reading: Stacks (STX) Fired Up Along With Top Coins With 26% Rally Significant is the Nakamoto upgrade, scheduled before the Bitcoin halving in April. This upgrade is seen as a pivotal moment for STX, promising dramatic improvements in speed and efficiency, including 5-second block times and support for sBTC, a secure version of wrapped Bitcoin. This development, according to North Rock Digital, positions STX closer to being a true Bitcoin L2. The hedge fund also points out the broader context within the Bitcoin ecosystem that favors STX. The rising demand for Bitcoin’s block space, notably with a 50x spike in network average gas fees this year, alongside the development of Ordinals, indicates a growing interest in utilizing Bitcoin beyond just a store of value. These developments, coupled with the anticipated US spot Bitcoin ETF approval, are expected to boost the demand for STX’s offerings. Furthermore, STX has been somewhat overlooked recently, providing what North Rock Digital sees as a unique investment opportunity. “Despite these positive developments, attention on STX has declined […] leaving us with a unique opportunity,” the thesis elaborates. Notably, the Stacks developer team’s progress towards the Nakamoto upgrade is on track, with the Mockamoto milestone already completed. The fund also emphasizes Stacks’ international partnerships and upcoming initiatives. These include the launch of a marketing campaign in Asia and the roll-out of the second Nakamoto testnet by January. “Stacks is expanding their footprint globally… They will run a marketing campaign to raise awareness for Bitcoin L2s in the first quarter of ’24 with a focus in South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong and Dubai,” the fund explains.

Moreover, the introduction of new Bitcoin L1 tools like BitVM is also seen as a significant step towards realizing a true Bitcoin L2 vision without needing changes to Bitcoin L1. STX Valuation In terms of valuation, STX is currently seen as undervalued, especially when compared to other L1/L2 ecosystems. With the Nakamoto upgrade and the proximity to the next BTC halving, STX is expected to narrow its valuation discount relative to other assets, North Rock Digital claims. Post-Nakamoto, STX is anticipated to enable a range of applications, including a performant BTC-denominated NFT marketplace and traditional DeFi applications. The potential for these applications, combined with the strong BTC-centric community of STX, presents a compelling case for its future growth. At press time, STX stood near its yearly high and was trading at $1.15.

Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  These figures were without the liquidations of futures trading bitcoin [BTC] and ether [ETH], which topped the charts at a cumulative $85 million in evaporated bets.  Some $15 million in ORDI bets were liquidated, followed by $12 million on BIGTIME. These consisted of both longs, or bets on higher prices, and shorts, or bets against. Prices of both these tokens whipsawed in the past 24 hours, impacting traders on either side.  Demand for Bitcoin-linked tokens has created hype for ORDI, which is tied to Bitcoin’s ecosystem – with the tokens gaining 580% in the past month. Meanwhile, an ongoing narrative for crypto gaming platforms has benefited BIGTIME holders, who have gained nearly 400% since the start of November.  Traders of Celestia’s TIA and Memeland’s MEME – both tokens were issued last month – lost some $10 million.  Elsewhere, bets on tokens tied to Terra’s once-titan ecosystem soured, with traders of LUNC, USTC and LUNA losing some $11 million.

6853,http://blokt.com/?p=48429,1701761459,How to Make & Setup A VPN Server – 2023 In-Depth DIY Guide,"The Internet is no longer a safe place . Sometimes it seems that the Internet was designed to make it easy for governments, businesses, and snoops of all sorts to spy on regular people . So it is no surprise that vast numbers of people are using VPNs to protect themselves. How to set up your own VPN But even the best commercial VPN services have their weaknesses. That’s why more and more people are looking to create their own VPN . In this article, we’ll look at the various reasons to set up your own VPN as well as reasons not to do so. We’ll also talk about three ways to get the job done and look at one of them in more detail. By the end of this article, you should have a good sense of whether or not setting up your own VPN makes sense for you, and which approach you would like to take . Reasons to Setup Your Own VPN There are lots of reasons to use a VPN in today’s world. But since you are here, we assume you already know why you need a VPN. We further assume that you are trying to decide between using a commercial VPN Service like ExpressVPN or NordVPN or creating your own VPN . To help you make that decision, here are some good reasons to setup your own VPN instead of subscribing to a commercial service: You want the benefits of a VPN Service without the monthly payments. You don’t want to take the chance that your online activities will be logged by a VPN Service. (Although, services like ExpressVPN have proven themselves to be zero log time and time again in various legal battles) You want access to your home network from anywhere in the world. You want access to local resources (your home Netflix account, for example) when you are in a different geographic location. You want to give other people access to resources on your home network. Reasons Not to Setup Your Own VPN While there are some good reasons to set up your own VPN, there are also a lot of reasons not to do so . These include: You don’t have a fast Internet connection – You need both fast upload and download speeds wherever your VPN Server is located or it will slow down everything connected to your personal VPN. You need a VPN to connect to resources in other geographic locations – VPN Services with multiple servers let you make it appear you are located in any of dozens, even hundreds of locations around the world. Since your VPN would have only one server you can only appear to be located in one place. You want to hide your IP Address – If you build your VPN Server on your own hardware, it will have an IP Address associated with your home network. You don’t want to handle the maintenance – It falls on you to maintain and update the VPN Server as well as the hardware and software it runs on. You have to have the technical ability to set up the VPN Server and clients. You want to hide your payment and identity information fully. The VPN you setup yourself might be safe from logging, but if you purchased the server you tunnel through, with your real name and payment details you are much more vulnerable than using a VPN service. VPN Basics If you are considering setting up your own VPN, you’ve probably got all the basics down already, but just in case, we’re going to start at the beginning. If you are clear on this stuff already, go ahead and skip ahead to, “ Three Ways to Setup a VPN of Your Own .” When you connect your device to an Internet resource without a VPN, the contents of the messages going back and forth are potentially visible to snoops . In addition, for the Internet to know where to send the messages, each message must expose a header that contains your IP Address as well as the IP address of the Internet resource you are connected to. Your IP Address Can Be Seen If You’re Not Using a VPN So everything is visible to snoops with the right tool. Many Internet resources try to stop snoops with HTTPS . This is an Internet protocol that automatically encrypts the contents of messages. This can definitely help since it prevents snoops from seeing the contents of the messages going back and forth. But HTTPS doesn’t do anything to prevent snoops from seeing that you (a device at your IP Address to be more precise) are communicating with that particular Internet resource. Using a VPN eliminates this problem. Here’s why: A VPN addresses this problem by putting a VPN Server in the middle of the conversation . The VPN Server sits between your device and an Internet resource. Your device only connects to the VPN Server. The Internet resource only connects to the VPN Server. The VPN Server passes messages back and forth between your device and the resource. This helps because the VPN Server uses its own IP Address when communicating with the resource on behalf of your device. Anyone spying on the connection between the server and the resource would only see the IP Addresses of the VPN Server and the Internet resource. Your privacy is protected on this part of the connection because no one looking at this connection can see your IP Address. VPN Diagram But that still leaves the connection between the VPN Client and the VPN Server. To address this part of the problem, the client and server encapsulate messages passing between them. That is, they encrypt the entirety of the messages between the device and the resource. Then they include the encrypted messages inside another message. This second message is what goes back and forth between the client and the server. The advantage of doing this is that only the second message’s header information needs to be visible to the world. And all that message’s header can reveal is that your device and a VPN Server are communicating with each other. Snoops can’t see anything of the original message because the whole message, including the header, is encrypted in the body of the outer message. At the VPN Server, messages coming from your device are extracted from the body of the outer message and decrypted. Then, in the header of your device’s message, the IP Address of your device is replaced by the IP Address of the VPN Server . This modified message is what gets sent to the Internet resource. Messages coming from the Internet resource arrive at the VPN Server. There, the IP Address of the VPN Server gets replaced by the IP Address of your device . This modified message then travels down the tunnel to the VPN Client in your device, where it is extracted, decrypted, and passed along to your device as if the VPN wasn’t in the middle of everything. Guide on How to Setup Your Own VPN As we’ve just seen, the VPN Server is the core of a functional VPN. In the rest of this article, we will look at ways to set up your own VPN Server and ignore the VPN Client. There are two reasons for this. The VPN Server you set up will dictate how you need to set up your VPN Clients. There are way too many devices you can connect to your VPN . If we tried to talk about the VPN Clients for each we would never finish writing this article. As it turns out, setting up your own VPN Server is plenty complicated enough for one article. We’ll start exploring this topic by looking at the three ways to set up a VPN server of your own. Three Ways to Setup a VPN Server of Your Own There are three ways to setup your own VPN Server . The way you go will depend on what you plan to do with the VPN and what hardware you will be using. You can set up the VPN Server: On your router – If you are using a router with built-in VPN capabilities, or your router supports custom firmware like DD-WRT or OpenWrt, you can set up the VPN Server on your router. On your own computer – If installing the VPN Server on your router isn’t an option, you can set up a VPN Server on a spare computer, even something tiny and low-powered like a Raspberry Pi. This is relatively easy to do, particularly if you use a computer running Microsoft Windows, which has built-in VPN capabilities. Of course, if you go this route, you will need to keep the computer that hosts your VPN Server running whenever you want to use the VPN. On a cloud service – This approach doesn’t require you to have any additional hardware. However, if you host your VPN Server on a cloud service, you need to keep in mind that the cloud service will be able to see whatever you do with the VPN. Let’s look at each of these options in more detail. Setting Up a VPN Server on Your Router Some home and business routers have a VPN Server built right into them . To use it, you simply need to log into the router, then turn on and configure the VPN Server. If your router has this capability, the manual that came with it should give you instructions on how to activate it. If not, a search formatted something like this should lead you to those instructions: Router name VPN configuration A more common situation is where your router doesn’t have a built-in VPN Server but “supports” one. This typically means that you can install third-party firmware on the router and that when the right firmware is installed, the router will be able to function as a VPN Server. Three types of third-party router firmware are the most popular. These are: DD-WRT Tomato OpenWrt Not all routers support these firmware packages . To find out if yours does, you’ll either need to dig through your router’s documentation or check the site of the firmware you want to use. DD-WRT has a Router Database where you can search for your router to see if it is supported. The main Tomato page linked above lists the routers that are known to work with this firmware. OpenWrt has a Supported Devices page with the information you need. Even if your router does support one of these firmware packages, installing new firmware on a router is not a job for a computer beginner . While the sites provide detailed instructions for installing their firmware, there is a lot more involved than running an install program. And one possible result of making a mistake is turning your router into a useless piece of junk that you can only throw away. Here’s a high-level view of the DD-WRT installation process: DD-WRT installation process As you can see, this isn’t a spur of the moment project. But if you do decide you want to give it a go, you’ll find more information in our guide on ‘ How to Set up a VPN on a Router .’ Setting Up a VPN Server on Your Own Computer If your router doesn’t support third-party firmware, or you don’t want to take the chance of wrecking it, you can install a VPN Server on one of your own computers . Doing this will allow you to have access to files on the computer that hosts the VPN Server, as well as resources on your network that are accessible from the computer. The easiest route is to use a Windows or Mac desktop that you are willing to leave running 24 hours a day . After all, a VPN Server does you no good if the computer it runs on is turned off when you need it. Turning a Single-Board Computer into a Dedicated VPN Server A slightly geekier approach is to take a small device like a Raspberry Pi and turn it into a dedicated VPN Server . This approach has the advantage of not tying up a larger, more expensive, more power-hungry computer for this single task. Raspberry Pi – Photo courtesy Ruth Salinas Correa Even a Raspberry Pi is potent enough for a basic VPN Server. While this is a cool way to go and appeals to the geek side of your author, there are a few disadvantages to this approach: You need a Raspberry Pi to dedicate to the task. It adds an additional level of learning to the project if you aren’t already familiar with these devices. The performance of the VPN could suffer . Encrypting, encapsulating, and decrypting messages takes a lot of computing power and small devices like this will do the job slower than full-sized machines. If this approach appeals to you, we suggest you visit the PiVPN site. It shows you how to set up OpenVPN on a Raspberry Pi with a minimum of fuss and bother. Or watch this video: Setting Up a VPN Server on a Cloud Service Setting up a VPN Server on a cloud service eliminates the need for your own hardware . You don’t need to hack your router or dedicate a computer to playing the role of VPN Server. This can be a convenient way to go. But there are drawbacks to this approach as well. When you set up a VPN Server on a cloud service, you do so by installing software on a virtual machine running on the cloud services servers . This means that your VPN Server will be slow since it will be running on distant, simulated hardware. It also means that you need to trust the cloud service completely . Everything you do will happen on their hardware, using their virtual machines. This leaves you with the same problem as using a commercial VPN Service: you need to trust a third-party. The difference here is that commercial VPN Services sell themselves on their commitment to protecting your privacy. Services like ExpressVPN and NordVPN base themselves in jurisdictions where your privacy rights are protected . They cannot easily be forced to log your activities and share that information with the NSA, MI6, or whoever else is out there trying to spy on you. Cloud services have a very different business model and are often based in places like the USA, where your privacy is not well protected . In our opinion, the chances that a cloud service would log your activities on their own, or be pressured into it by their local government, are much higher than with a top-notch commercial VPN Service. How to Set Up a Personal VPN Server on DigitalOcean One of the triggers for writing this article was seeing some online claims that it is quick and easy to set up a VPN Server on a cloud service . With people claiming you could have a VPN Server up and running in 10 minutes for only a few dollars a month (or even free for the first year), we thought we should investigate. What we found was not encouraging. The approaches we found a FOSS VPN Server called Algo . Algo seems to be a great software and works as advertised. It provides encrypted communications between your devices, and the Algo VPN Server running on Amazon EC2, DigitalOcean, Microsoft Azure, and other similar services. Algo VPN But it doesn’t give you anonymity , and it doesn’t support the commonly-used OpenVPN protocol. The problems come in with fast and easy claims. Unless you are a computer tech with Linux experience, setting up Algo isn’t easy or fast . It takes around 20 steps, many of which are done on the Linux command line. We had an experienced engineer set up Algo on DigitalOcean , and it took about 45 minutes. To give you an idea of what you will need to deal with if you decide to install Algo on a cloud service, here are selected screenshots of the process . First, you need to set up an account at the service (DigitalOcean in this example): DigitalOcean Dashboard Clicking the Get Started with a Droplet (the DigitalOcean version of a virtual machine) gave us the options shown in the next screenshot. We created a Droplet running Ubuntu 18.04 by clicking the relevant button and selecting the plan we wanted: Create Droplets – DigitalOcean After a few minutes of waiting while DigitalOcean created the Droplet for us, we had a virtual machine running Ubuntu 18.04 ready to roll: Virtual Machine running Ubuntu 18.04 We logged into the Droplet and followed the instructions in the Algo Github repository to download and extract the Algo files, install Algo core and remaining dependencies. Then we opened the Algo Config.cfg file and edited it to include the list of users who would be able to log into the VPN: Algo Config File With all that out of the way we launched the Algo installer , and selected the DigitalOcean option: Algo Installer The Algo installer uses the DigitalOcean API to do most of the configuration work, so we sat back and waited about 15 minutes for the installation to finish. As mentioned in the following screen capture, there are several values you must copy from the console once the installer finishes its work. Without these, you will not be able to add new users later: Algo Installer – Last Step With that, the Algo VPN Server is installed in a DigitalOcean Droplet . Now all you have to do is manually configure every client device that will connect to the server. Depending on the device, setting up the client could be pretty easy, or not so easy . As with setting up the server, the Algo Github page has links to the details of setting up clients on various popular types of devices. When you finish that task you will have a fully functioning VPN Service of your own. It will be a slow VPN. You will need to trust that DigitalOcean won’t snoop on you as we discussed earlier. And because it has only a single server, it will be of limited use compared to commercial VPN Services, but it will be yours. Despite the articles talking about the benefits of doing so, we really can’t see much reason to create your own VPN using a cloud service other than as an exercise for hardcore techies. Conclusion There are some privacy and security advantages of setting up your own VPN. These are most pronounced when you set up a VPN Server on your own hardware. In this article, we looked at three ways to get the job done , two of which involve setting up the server on your own hardware. This table summarizes the pros and cons of each of the three approaches, as well as those of using a commercial VPN Service. Pros and Cons for Setting Up Your Own VPN VPN Server on Your Own Router VPN Server on Your Own Computer VPN Server on Cloud Service Using a Commercial VPN Service Protects Entire Network Specific Devices Specific Devices Specific Devices or entire network depending on service selected Privacy No need to trust third-parties No need to trust third-parties Cloud Service could log activities VPN Service could log activities Security Good Good Low Best Speed Medium Slow Slowest Fastest Ease of Setup Medium Low Low High Ease of Maintenance Medium Low Low High As we’ve seen, while setting up a VPN Server for your own use is doable, it can be a lot of work and requires much more technical expertise than simply subscribing to a commercial VPN Service. If you do decide to go this route, remember that you’ll also need to set up VPN Clients for each device you want to connect to your server. If the VPN Server documentation doesn’t have instructions you need, you should be able to find them with a quick web search . If setting up your own VPN isn’t for you, we suggest you check out our review of the Best VPN Services for 2023. To help you decide between them, we organized them by use case , best VPNs for beginners , best for streaming , best for use on mobile devices , and so on. References What is a VPN Server ?

6863,http://blokt.com/?p=1457,1701759657,What is Ethereum? Read the ULTIMATE Research-Backed ETH Guide,"Ethereum is the leading blockchain app platform that was proposed in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin and went live on July 30, 2015. So what exactly is Ethereum? There are many different strands to this project and getting your head around it all can be quite the challenge. That’s why we have put together this comprehensive guide for those of you wondering “What is Ethereum?” and “How does Ethereum Work?” As the harbinger of the second generation of blockchains and home to the second largest digital currency in the world, Ether (ETH), the Ethereum project has started a new era of blockchain development that enables a global community of developers to unleash their creativity in the space. The ability to craft smart contracts gave developers a chance to think about new use cases for blockchain technology that previously remained largely connected to cryptocurrencies. Ethereum, the blockchain app platform – Source: Ethereum.org Ethereum also gave enterprises, organizations, and startups the ability to issue their own tokens, and build their own unique blockchain ecosystem using the Ethereum framework. Till date, Ethereum-based ERC20 tokens have been the most popular means for launching Initial Coin Offerings . Of course, Ethereum is still in development and has faced some hurdles. It has faced problems related to scalability, which was highlighted when the popular game dedicated to internet-bred cats called CryptoKitties managed to clog its network in December 2017. However, with a unique concept, upcoming developments, a strong developer community and the first-mover advantage (second only to the mighty Bitcoin), Ethereum is one blockchain project that continues to remain at the forefront of DLT and crypto development. So… What is Ethereum? In a nutshell, Ethereum is an open source Smart contract and Decentralized Application Platform. The Ethereum whitepaper describes the project as the next generation distributed computing platform, that provides a decentralized virtual machine known as the Ethereum Virtual machine EVM. The latter is able to execute Peer-to-Peer contracts by means of Ether (ETH), its proprietary crypto fuel. Blockchain technology is used as a tool of shared consensus, while Ether is the digital asset that is used to pay for transaction fees and computational services. What’s the Difference Between Bitcoin and Ethereum? Ethereum vs Bitcoin graphic – Source: Shutterstock.com Since the advent of the Ethereum project in late 2014 and its explosion of popularity within the confines of the nascent crypto space and beyond, Ethereum has always been compared to Bitcoin. All being similar to the use of Blockchain as the underpinning technology, both projects are fundamentally different. The main difference between them is the purpose of each one. In fact, Bitcoin was built as an alternative to regular money. Bitcoin can be used as a medium of value exchange, a means of payment and a store of value with no central authority to issue or control it and no intrinsic value or physical existence. On the other hand, Ethereum is rather a platform for developers to build and run Peer-to-Peer executable contracts and decentralized applications. Block time generation (seconds in the case of Ethereum and minutes in the case of Bitcoin), the rate at which new coins are mined (constant in Ethereum and halves every 4 year in the case of Bitcoin), the proof of work hashing algorithm (Ethhash in Ethereum, and Sha 256 in Bitcoin), and the total supply (capped to 21 millions in the case of Bitcoin and uncapped in that of Ethereum) are the other differences that set both projects apart. Ethereum Bitcoin Release Date July 30, 2015 January 9, 2008 Release Method Presale Genesis Block Mined Founder Vitalik Buterin Satoshi Nakamoto Blockchain Proof of Work (Will transition to Proof of Stake) Proof of Work Purpose Blockchain app platform, smart contracts & digital currencies Digital Money & store of value Native Cryptocurrency Ether (ETH) Bitcoin (BTC) Algorithm Ethash SHA-256 Block Time 12 – 14 seconds 10 minutes The Ethereum Virtual Machine The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), is a 256-bit quasi-turning-complete virtual state machine that forms the runtime environment for smart contracts and specifies the execution model for such contracts. Note: “quasi” in here comes from the fact that computation is intrinsically bounded by a parameter, which is gas. The latter limits the amount of computation done The machine is stack based, altogether separate from the main Ethereum Network, and has its own independent storage model. In fact, all the nodes on the Ethereum Network run the EVM in addition to validating transactions. The EVM could be seen as a testing ground for Smart contracts because once these contracts are deployed to the mainnet, such a step can’t be reversed. Any developer that wants to build on Ethereum, could deploy his/her untested code on this network of computers and see how it muddles along. The most powerful aspect of the EVM is that it can be implemented into various different programming languages. So far, EVM iterations have been deployed in C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Haskell, Rust, Erlang, WebAssembly and more – promoting adoption and ensuring all developers can have fair access. This is particularly important for interoperability with other blockchains, as it means that any other blockchain could essentially run and iteration of the EVM which could power smart contracts and DApps on their chain, without building a specific virtual machine for their own chain. Blockchains which currently use or offer versions of the EVM include Telos , Hyperledger Fabric, EOSIO, and others – and blockchains like Tron use virtual machines which are based on or compatible with EVM. Ether (ETH) and Gas Ether (ETH) and gas illustration – Source: Shutterstock.com In Ethereum each operation or work performed by the network has a cost assessed by the network which is known as a gas limit . In order to execute a smart contract, for example, developers need to pay for all the operations featured in their code. Sending Ether from one wallet to another one involves four gas units. These gas units are checking your balance, transferring ETH to a receiving address, subtracting ETH from your balance and adding ETH to the receivers. So gas units refer to the smallest measurement of work needed to settle a given operation but don’t have a monetary value. The cost is paid in Ether. Gas is that unit that translates into Ether. Since Ethereum can only compute a limited number of gas units at any given time, miners are sort of bribed by network users to pace up the stream of request that is being sent over to the network. To pay miners, small fractions of ETH named Gwei are attached to each gas unit , which sets the gas price. What everyone should remember is that the gas price is how much you pay per gas unit , and the gas limit is how much work you are requesting from the network. Smart Contracts – What Are They and How Do They Work? Smart contracts refer to computer codes that facilitate the exchange of value whether it is money, property or content. They are called contracts because they translate the terms of an agreement, and smart because they automatically execute themselves once specific triggers are met. The notion of smart contracts was around way before the advent of Bitcoin or Ethereum. Quick Fact: Nick Szabo a computer scientist, cryptographer, and law scholar, started pioneering work on the concept in 1977, with the aim to establish a distributed ledger for storing contracts. Simply put smart contracts are just like regular contracts in the real world, where two parties or more agree to specific terms of an arrangement and commit to sticking to it once signed. The main difference is that Smart contracts are fully digital. Furthermore, when running on a Blockchain like the Ethereum Network, a smart contract acts as a self-operating computer code that automatically executes itself once specific conditions are met. Blockchain-based smart contracts are immutable and would run exactly as programmed once deployed without any possibility of censorship, downtime, reversing, or third-party interference. Other Blockchains Which Utilize Smart Contracts Smart contract enabling Blockchains are regarded by many as the “ real deal ,” this whole Blockchain revolution came up with since its rise to prominence. Put by Nick Szabo, the blockchain pioneer, himself : “New institutions and new ways to formalize the relationships that make up these institutions are now made possible by the digital revolution. I call these new contracts “smart” because they are far more functional than their inanimate paper-based ancestors. No use of artificial intelligence is implied. A smart contract is a set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on these promises.” We crafted a list of ten blockchains, other than Ethereum, that support Smart Contract programming and deployment. Cardano: a project that caught a lot of media attention, and that is allegedly developing a smart contract platform that seeks to deliver more advanced features than its competitors do. EOS: a Smart Contract platform for industrial scale dApps deployments through a DAO model, commonly referred to as the alternative to Ethereum. NEM: written in Java, the NEM platform is arguably one of the simplest to use since no specific platform programing language is required to code and deploy smart contracts on it. Waves: the underdog of this list, it is an open source smart contract platform that focuses on scalability and speed of settlements. Other interesting blockchain projects that could play an important role in the future of smart contracts, are Hyperledger Fabric , Lisk , NEO , Qtum , Stellar Lumens , and Tezos . Ethereum Use Cases Smart contracts make Ethereum flexible, providing it with more real-world use cases than its predecessor Bitcoin. A combination of smart contracts and dApps keep developers intrigued and users interested in the network. According to ConsenSys, some industries and sectors where use cases for Ethereum can be found include : Banking and Financial Services: Large banks routinely spend more than $200 million per year on cybersecurity. If the servers of a central bank were to go down, you would see the collapse of a country’s payment clearing system. However, if every bank within a payment network instead transacted through a blockchain, there would be no single point of failure. Therefore, a country’s interbank payment network could be maintained even if multiple servers were to go down. Also, because the basic idea behind blockchains- creating a distributed, public and immutable ledger with a never-to-be-tampered with the record of transactions remains the same, the data behind the credit score of a user becomes more reliable for financial companies. Related industries like insurance can also be hugely benefitted as they can disburse payments more easily to their customers. Startups and ICOs: Ethereum empowers startups by letting them launch their own Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). These tokens, usually created using the ERC20 protocol, help startups in raising the funds needed to realize their goals. Interestingly, one of the largest crypto exchanges and companies in the world, Binance, used funding generated through the sale of BNB, a coin that follows the ERC20 standards. Even Tron, one of the largest blockchain projects in the world started out with an ERC20 token offering. Digital Identities: Since data and identity theft is such a menace, a smart contract solution is a good fit for this problem. Using information hidden behind a dedicated smart contract, users could not only take their identities digital but rest assured that they do not reveal more than what they are comfortable sharing. Services like uPort allow users to take back control of their identities and share only the information they choose through their mobile devices. Information can only be shared upon authentication from the user and the data is always stored safely on the Ethereum blockchain. Supply Chain: A major application for Ethereum smart contracts looks set to be in supply chain management where it could benefit both consumers and suppliers through more efficient tracking. Whether you want to know about the freshness of produce or the origins of the diamonds you bought for your wedding, blockchain-based smart contracts can help to deliver this. The supply chain system of the world is currently broken but not beyond repair. Using an extensive network of smart contracts, companies can track their raw materials and the transportation of goods. They can accurately measure their manufacturing processes, related logistics and the process through which a product reaches a consumer. The consumer, on the other hand, is provided with reliable information that instantly proves whether a product is fresh, authentic, fair trade, locally produced and more. Other major industries and applications where Ethereum could find many uses include Real Estate, Law, Oil and Gas, Energy Grid, Government, and Commodity Trade Finance and more as stated by ConsenSys. Ethereum’s Most Popular dApps Here are some of the most popular dApps that run on the Ethereum blockchain : CryptoKitties: The internet’s obsession with cats knows no bounds and when CryptoKitties was launched, it was evident that there would be more than a handful of interested players. The game allows players to buy, sell, collect, and breed digital cats. Each cat is unique and has its own value. CryptoKitties received widespread attention from the media, the crypto community and the “ uninitiated ” people who may have never heard about cryptocurrencies and blockchains before when cats on the game started selling for thousands of dollars. CryptoKitties remains one of the most popular dApps and should be credited for evolving the scope of dApps from “ work ” to “ play ” while adding value to “ digital asset ownership .” LocalEthereum: The second-generation blockchain cousin of LocalBitcoins, LocalEthereum solves one BIG problem for buyers- removing middlemen from the crypto ecosystem. You buy ETH over the counter using smart contracts and escrow services available on the platform. The seller’s Ethereum is locked via a smart contract and is released only when they receive the agreed fiat currency from the buyer. IDEX: The IDEX decentralized exchange is considered by some a thing of beauty, especially as it introduces Ethereum users to the idea of giving up on “ centralized exchanges .” Some of the most popular dApps on Ethereum are decentralized exchanges- they are new, innovative and remove a big hurdle from the world of digital currencies, providing more power to the users. The first adopters of IDEX were speculators, and the exchange enables a huge range of Ethereum and ERC20 tokens to be traded and exchanges. However, popular cryptocurrencies such as XRP, Litecoin, Bitcoin and Tron is not possible. Ethlance: Giving other freelancing job platforms a run for their money, Ethlance allows users to work on gigs or projects of their choice without paying a hefty fee. This could mark the beginning of the end of freelancers having to give away over 20% of their earnings to centralized platforms such as Upwork in “ fees ” and part with even more dollars to get the money in their local currency. Ethlance, the decentralized freelance hiring platform allows you to work for zero fees. The only payment here is the gas utilized on Ethereum. Uniswap Protocol Part decentralized application and part decentralized protocol, Uniswap provides automated liquidity on Ethereum, for Ethereum-based tokens – such as ERC20 tokens and certain ERC721 non-fungibles.Uniswap has quickly become one of the most popular apps on Ethereum, and many developers and liquidity providers use the protocol to make trading low market cap tokens easy and simple. Users can integrate Uniswap with Ethereum wallets such as MetaMask, which automatically links users tokens with the Uniswap protocol and lets traders easily swap their tokens for others. AAVE One of the most popular decentralized finance (Defi) lending protocols, AAVE has taken the crypto finance world by storm. AAVE is an open-source money market protocol build atop Ethereum, which lets users borrow assets, and lend out their assets in order to gain fixed interest back.AAVE, which means Ghost in Finnish to show the protocol’s transparency, has over $1.8 billion staked with it in assets which include DAI, USDC, TUSD, USDT, BUSD, ETH, BAT, LINK, REP, and a whole host of other popular assets. Users have either a ‘Deposit APY’, which is the interest that they will earn on their deposited assets and ‘Variable APY’ which is the amount borrowers pay back into the lending protocol. Many users leverage the AAVE protocol to borrow assets for short-term trading opportunities and to take advantage of market swings. Other popular Ethereum dApps include FCK , Kyber , ForkDelta , Etheroll, and more. Pros and Cons of dApps Pros and Cons illustration – Source: Shutterstock.com The pros – Here are some of the key benefits of decentralized applications: Fault tolerance – Systems use redundancy to remove the risk of accidental failure. If one element goes down the network still works, this means applications can run with zero downtime. Attack resistance – There is no single point of failure, as the applications run on the blockchain. This makes them impervious to denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Tamper & corruption proof – Applications run precisely as programmed removing the possibility of fraud, censorship or third-party interference. This makes it more difficult for an individual or group to act for its own benefit at the expense of everyone else. No middlemen – This removes exuberant fees and allows users to interact directly with each other (peer-to-peer). This can lead to greater transparency, trust, and privacy. Open source – An open-source protocol enables anyone interested in the dApp to collectively contribute to its development for the benefit of everyone. The Cons – Here are some of the negatives of decentralized applications: Speed – Currently the dApps can be quite slow with transactions also taking a long time. Scalability – The limit on how many transactions can be processed per second might be quite low which limits the dApps scalability. Fees – While in some ways the ‘compensating system’ is a benefit, it also means users have to pay each time they use the dApp. It’s worth noting that solutions and new innovations are constantly occurring in the nascent dApp and blockchain industries, so the current ‘cons’ may well be overcome in the future. The DAO Hack The DAO was a project that crystallized most of what blockchain technology stood for since its inception, in both its business model and management structure. The DAO (Organization) logo It was created in 2016 by members from within the Ethereum community, notably the Slock.it developer team. The DAO was conceived as a form of investor-oriented, stateless, decentralized venture capital firm after raising a record-breaking crowdfund sale of around $150 million worth of Ether in May 2016. Unfortunately, when things were looking up for the project, it turned out that there was a flaw in its source code, and that flaw was eventually preyed on. On June 17, 2016, some hacker(s) exploited a loophole in the DAO smart contract and drained as much as 3.6 million ETH (around $70 million at the time) to a subsidiary account in just a few hours of the attack. In fact, the attack was found to be made possible when the hacker(s) realized that the smart contract was mistakenly coded to check the internal balance after sending coins not the other way around. The attacker(s) proceeded by requesting funds from the smart contract several times before the smart contract could update its balance. The hack marked the beginning of the end for the DAO and had far-reaching consequences on the Blockchain space that are still tangible today. Besides delisting the DAO token off major exchanges in the months following the hack, and hard forking the Ethereum main chain, the incident caught the eye of regulatory watchdogs all over the world, and put a special emphasis on the necessity of placing the crypto sphere under close scrutiny. Ethereum Classic Fork In the wake of the DAO hack, the Ethereum community gathered and debated on the proper actions the foundation should take in order to handle the disastrous situation the hacking incident has cast over the project. The community split into two fundamentally opposed groups. Ethereum and Ethereum Classic – Source: Shutterstock.com While one side suggested a hard fork to contain the hack, reverse it, and send the stolen funds back to their original wallets, the other side strongly opposed the move invoking ideological reasons, and arguing that prevailing with the code and trusting the smart contract under all circumstances, is the philosophy behind Blockchain, and failing to commit to it, could open the door for similar actions in the future. A vote took place in July 2016 and the decision to implement a hard fork to the Ethereum code and move the stolen Ether away to a new smart contract was agreed upon by a vast majority of the community including co-founders Gavin Woods and Vitalik Buterin. Consequently, a hard fork occurred on the main Blockchain at height 1,920,000, right before the hacking incident took place. The offshoot kept the name Ethereum and named its fuel Ether, ETH. However, the other group, or “ the code is law ” advocates, decided to stick with the original chain, which became known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Mining Did you know that Google CEO Sundar Pichai’s 11-year-old son mines Ethereum? The young one, Pichai says, understands a lot about cryptocurrency and has corrected him on occasion. Do you know as much about Ethereum mining as Pichai’s son? Well if not, don’t worry as we have all the information you need here to boost your knowledge on the subject. In a nutshell, Ethereum mining is similar to Bitcoin mining. The concept of mining, i.e., giving rewards to “ miners ” who create new blocks in the network in the form of a native cryptocurrency of the blockchain, is the same. However, the Ethereum blockchain is faster than Bitcoin’s, which means that blocks are created at a faster rate. In the Bitcoin Network, a new block is created every 10 minutes while Ethereum achieves the same in 15 seconds. Miners on the Ethereum network receive ETH tokens along with all the gas contained within their block (gas is the fuel of all Ethereum transactions which manifests as code-processing and transaction fees on the blockchain). Can You Mine Ethereum With ASIC? Yes, it is currently possible to mine Ethereum with ASIC. However, an Ethereum Core Development meeting recently pushed forward a proposal called ‘ ProgPoW ‘ that would make Ethereum ASIC resistant. How Many Ethereum Nodes Are There? According to Ethernodes.org , the Ethereum mainnet hosts about 8,752 nodes at the moment. However, this figure changes on a daily basis. Of these, the largest majority of nodes are based in the USA while China, Canada, Germany, the UK, Russia, and more trail quite far behind. The total amount of Ethereum nodes as of Feb 20, 2019, and their distribution around the world – Source: Ethernodes.org Are These Nodes Full Nodes? A full node is any computer that enforces all the rules of consensus on the Ethereum network and is connected to it. A full node must have the entire Ethereum blockchain downloaded on its computer. By definition, all miners in the Ethereum network have to be full nodes. However, all full nodes do not have to mine the currency. The nodes have a few important functions. They have to ensure that all the miners are given the correct block rewards. They must ensure all transactions have the right signatures. They must check that all blocks and transactions are in the right data format. They must make sure there is no double-spending in the blocks. How Can I Use Ether (ETH)? Ether is one of the most versatile coins available in the cryptocurrency space today. As the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world, Ether has many holders. Top 5 cryptocurrencies by market cap as of Feb 25, 2019 – Source: CoinMarketCap Per the most recent CoinMarketCap data , Ether is valued at over $15 billion with 104 million coins in circulation currently. Here are a few of the common uses of ETH: For making transactions: Ether can be used as an alternative to using credit cards and wire transfers. However, to make a transaction with Ether both the sender and receiver must have an Ether wallet set up. For cross-border payments, Ether could work to be much cheaper and faster than traditional methods. For buying ICO tokens: When participating in token sales, Ethereum is often a popular cryptocurrency of choice. As a large number of Initial Coin Offerings are offered using the Ethereum blockchain, it means that buying tokens from these projects using ETH becomes easier. For making purchases in the real world: Several cryptocurrency startups are pushing for the adoption of digital currencies and helping in the installation of PoS machines and other methods that enable purchases using ETH. For making digital purchases: Many websites now accept payment in Ether, and your dApps could also accept ETH payments, enabling you to purchase anything from extra lives in games to subscriptions of a magazine. For trading/investing: Ether is one of the most commonly available trading pairs for digital currencies used in exchanges around the world. You can purchase Ether and hold it as an investment or exchange it directly for other cryptocurrencies. How Can I Store Ether (ETH)? Once you have bought Ether, you will need an Ethereum wallet to store it securely. You have the option to use hot wallets, cold wallets, hardware wallets, paper wallets, desktop or mobile wallets. There is one for all platforms; some options will be better suited in comparison to others. Note: Hot Wallets are connected to and can be accessed on the internet, whereas, cold wallets are very rarely or never connected to the internet. Due to this many consider cold wallets to be more secure than hot wallets. Let’s look into each option: Hot wallets- exchange wallets: You will most likely buy ETH on an exchange like Coinbase or Binance . These exchanges will provide you with a wallet where you can store your ETH. Exchange hot wallets are easy to use, very simple and it’s usually easy to liquidate your holdings since your coins can be accessed on the exchange’s website. Therefore, exchange wallets can usually be accessed from multiple devices as long as you have a connection to the internet. The problem with these wallets is that they could be more vulnerable to theft than others depending on the security of the exchange and your account. If you trade regularly, then this is likely the best and most convenient option. Cold wallets- hardware wallets: Hardware wallets can offer their users extremely strong security when used correctly. They are usually USB devices, and the market-leading provider of hardware wallets currently is Ledger. You can store your Ether holdings on a hardware wallet for as long as you wish and rest assured that they cannot be reached by a hacker. Just make sure that you do not lose the device or tell anyone else your passwords. Cold wallets- paper wallets: Paper wallets are considered the most secure way of storing your Ether safely away from malware and cyber-attackers. With a paper wallet, you print your private keys, and Ether addresses and store them in a safe location. However, to many, this can seem like a big inconvenience when compared to using an exchange wallet for example. Again, like with hardware wallets, it’s important to keep your paper wallet somewhere safe and never share the information with anyone else. Desktop and mobile wallets: As the name suggests, desktops and mobile wallets can be distinguished based on the devices where they are being used. Desktop wallets can be more functional, while mobile wallets provide more convenience. Mobile and desktop wallets can usually only be used on the device where they are installed. Therefore, if you lose the device, this will put your funds at risk. Some mobile/desktop wallets will be specifically designed for storing Ether and ERC20 tokens, whereas some will allow you to hold a wide range of cryptocurrencies together. Which Is the Best Ethereum Wallet? Given that there is such a wide range of wallet options out there, it begs the question, which ones are best? Well, to help answer that question, here are some of our handpicked favorites: Hardware wallet – Ledger Nano S The Ledger Nano S squeezes both advanced security and ease of use into one package. Our guide to storing cryptocurrencies securely on a Ledger Nano S can be found here. Desktop wallet – MetaMask This simple, easy to install and easy to use browser-based wallet lets you connect to Ethereum and a host of dApps hosted on the blockchain instantly. MetaMask is a highly popular wallet which has also received funding and support from ConsenSys and Ethereum. Fake versions of this wallet are out there so be sure to download a legit version. Basic Wallet – Mist Wallet If you are looking for nothing but the bare basics, then the Mist Wallet is the right choice for you. It was created by the Ethereum Foundation for a no-frills, no-distraction experience and is listed as the most basic wallet available on ethereum.org. Multicurrency Wallet – Exodus If you hold numerous cryptocurrencies and want a well-designed wallet that eliminates the need for multiple crypto wallets, then Exodus could be a good choice. Exodus is is fairly popular amongst crypto users and some cool features, including the portfolio feature where you can track your holdings. Web Wallet – MyEtherWallet MyEtherWallet is one of the most popular Ether wallets out there. As a web wallet, it allows you to log in from any device, which does bring some security risks. However, these risks can be mitigated if it’s paired with a hardware wallet such a the Ledger Nano S. Mobile Wallet – Trust Wallet Trust Wallet is now Binance’s official cryptocurrency wallet, and the app is available to download on both iOS and Android devices. It supports Ether and all Ethereum network tokens such as ERC20 tokens, as well as many other leading cryptocurrencies such as Dash, Tron, Litecoin, Bitcoin, and more. Where Can I Buy or Sell Ethereum? Cryptocurrency exchanges are the most common choice for buying or selling Ethereum . Cryptocurrency exchanges can be centralized or decentralized. The world’s three largest cryptocurrency exchanges are: Binance OKeX Huobi Screenshot of Ethereum trading on Binance – Source: Binance.com Other prominent exchanges include: Coinbase Bitfinex Upbit Kraken Digifinex Ether is available to buy, sell, and trade on all of these exchanges. As Ether is a leading digital coin, it is available on most cryptocurrency exchanges. Different payment methods for purchasing Ether on exchanges include by credit/debit card, with fiat currencies, and with cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. The fees charged by different exchanges will vary and will also depend on the payment method. Other options include cryptocurrency ATMs where you can buy Ether with cash, trading Ether peer-to-peer on LocalEthereum , and using conversion exchanges like Changelly and Shapeshift to swap fiat-to-ether or crypto-to-ether instantly. Is Coinbase Safe? Coinbase is a leading and popular cryptocurrency exchange based in the US. Currently, over 18% of the platform’s volume comes from ETH/USD trades. For people using the exchange’s services, Coinbase provides a hot wallet which can be used to store currencies. Coinbase holds over 98% of its user’s funds offline and takes other security measures, which prevents thefts and hacks from damaging user’s holdings. Any funds stored online by Coinbase are covered by insurance . Source: Coinbase.com Coinbase also enables two-factor authentication for the users, further protecting them from unauthorized access of accounts. Source: Coinbase.com Coinbase also runs a bug bounty program with an active community of security researchers that help to keep the platform safe. None the less, some users still may want to take full control of their security rather than rely on an exchange. If so, using one of the secure methods mentioned above such as a hardware wallet or paper wallet would be a good option. How Much Is Ethereum Worth? Ether’s price and market cap from Aug 7, 2015, to Feb 21, 2019 – Source: CoinMarketCap.com As of December, 2021, the price of Ether currently stands at $2248 with a market capitalization of $274 billion. In November and December 2015, Ether traded below the $1 mark. However, a year later, between October and December 2016, Ether’s price was nearing $10. In June 2017, prices went as high as $377.56 with market capitalization reaching over $34 billion. on January 13, 2018, the price of Ether reached an all-time high near $1,400, with a market capitalization of $133 billion . Since then, Ethereum has witnessed a massive sell-offs and tumbling prices in an unwavering bear market. However, like with all markets, a boom and bust cycle exists, and now everyone is waiting for a new bull market, with hopes that Ether could one day make an all-time high again. Ethereum Price Predictions From Big Names Ethereum has caught the attention of many crypto enthusiasts as well as prominent personalities from the traditional finance sector. Some have also made predictions about Ethereum’s price. Let’s look at what they had to say. Jeff Reed considers Ethereum more valuable than Bitcoin: Crypto author Jeff Reed believes that Bitcoin and Ethereum have little in their way to stop them from becoming alternative currency systems. He said: “You can conceivably trade anything using Ethereum, but this is not Ethereum’s strength in comparison to other cryptocurrencies – they can all do this. It’s rather the computing language that allows the smart contracts to exist that makes Ethereum more valuable than BTC (in my opinion).” Steven Nerayoff predicted $3,000: Co-creator of Ethereum, Steven Nerayoff noted that billions of dollars were being poured into the Ethereum ecosystem in Jan 2018, through ICOs. He was vouching for a $3000 price tag on Ether by the end of 2018, but unfortunately, this did not materialize. Nigel Green sticks to $2,500: deVere Group CEO Nigel Green suggested that Ethereum could reach $2500 by the end of 2018, followed by further increases in 2019 and 2020. He said: “The price of Ethereum is predicted to increase significantly this year, and could hit $2,500 by the end of 2018 with a further increase by 2019 and 2020. This general upswing will be fueled by three mains drivers. First, more and more platforms are using Ethereum as a means of trading. Second, the increased use of smart contracts by Ethereum. And third, the decentralization of cloud computing.” Who Is the Founder of Ethereum? Russian-Canadian programmer Vitalik Buterin is the co-founder of Ethereum. BREAKING NEWS: I hereby announce that I, Vitalik Buterin, am the founder of ethereum. — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) May 2, 2016 Vitalik conceived the idea of Ethereum and released a white paper in 2013 describing in detail its design and rationale. Vitalik had already been interested in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies since 2011. He co-founded the news website named ‘Bitcoin Magazine’ where he published hundreds of articles and was also involved with the privacy-focused Dark Wallet project. It was during this time that Vitalik came up with the idea of a single blockchain that could be reprogrammed to create custom decentralized applications rather than having to develop a whole new blockchain. In January 2014 Vitalik formally announced Ethereum at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami and started working with Dr. Gavin Wood who he went on to co-found Ethereum with. In July 2014 they launched a 42-day public sale of Ethereum tokens known as ‘Ether’ raising more than $18 million, which was the most successful ever crowd sale at the time. The Ethereum platform went live and launched a year later on June 30, 2015 , allowing developers to start creating and running decentralized applications. The Founding Team Apart from Vitalik Buterin, other people were also involved in designing and perfecting the concept of Ethereum. The most prominent among them is doctor Dr. Gavin Wood who wrote the “ technical bible ” called Ethereum yellow paper , which outlines the details of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Dr. Joseph Lubin is another prominent name who later built ConsenSys, a Brooklyn-based startup focusing on the Ethereum ecosystem. When the project was publicly announced in 2014, the core team consisted of Vitalik Buterin , Mihai Alisie , Anthony Di Lorio and Charles Hoskinson . Ethereum Co-Founders – Vitalik Buterin, Joseph Lubin, Charles Hoskinson, Gav Wood, Anthony Di Lorio & Mihai Alisie – Source: Twitter.com How Can Programmers Use Ethereum? Ethereum is a single blockchain with a built-in programming language. It serves as a platform where programmers can create, use and run many different types of decentralized applications . This has led to Ethereum being described as ‘The World Computer’ where just like with conventional computers the potential uses depend in part on the creativity of its users. To get started, programmers can start learning more about the foundational concepts of blockchains- decentralization and cryptography. They must familiarize themselves with the key feature of the Ethereum blockchain, smart contracts, as well as other components like GAS, Ether (ETH), and the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Programmers will also need to learn Solidity, the programming language used for Ethereum. What is Solidity? Solidity is the programming language used for creating smart contracts on Ethereum. According to Blockchain Council , Solidity is a high-level programming language, and the syntax is similar to the JavaScript scripting language. What is Solidity? – Source: Blockchain Council Solidity was initially proposed by Gavin Wood in August 2014. It was then developed by Gavin Wood, Alex Beregszaszi, Christian Reitwiessner, Yoichi Hirai, Liana Husikyan, and other former Ethereum core contributors. It was designed to enable the writing of smart contracts on platforms like Ethereum. For programmers who are well versed in JavaScript or C, Solidity will seem relatively proverbial . While Solidity is a fairly new language, there are numerous experts working on it, and there is ample documentation available to help new programmers who want to learn the basics. Ethereum 2.0 Update Ethereum has struggled with some scalability issues which could be a hurdle to the widespread adoption of the platform and Ether. Ethereum wants to overcome these hurdles with Ethereum 2.0, also called the ‘Casper’ Upgrade. The upgrade was originally expected to arrive in 2019, although there are still many technical hurdles to overcome. In August 2020, Ethereum 2.0 developers outlined several issued with the Medalla testnet, which was the first testnet that Ethereum 2.0 community members could use. The first issue was staking participation, which was fairly low – especially with Nimbus and Lodestar clients failing to verify some blocks and causing a 10% gap in expected staking – with a 57% staking participation. This number was also lower because some staking participants were offline when the network went live. It will include concepts like sharding which is expected to make the blockchain faster and more efficient. We will examine more on sharding later in this article. Once successfully upgraded, Ethereum 2.0 will then start on its journey moving towards Ethereum 3.0 which will provide the network with security against the power of quantum computers. Scaling Scaling could be considered the Achilles’ heel of the Ethereum network; however, a lot of work is being done in the background to try and overcome this. As Ethereum is not just a single blockchain, it also allows users to create their own blockchain-based projects on the original Ethereum blockchain. Furthermore, over 1400 dApps are running on Ethereum currently which means that the network already has a large number of users and processes millions of transactions. The problem begins when the number of apps, projects, and users increases to a level where the Ethereum blockchain nodes are unable to handle the ever-increasing amount of transactions. In fact, when the CryptoKitties game on the Ethereum network went viral in late 2017 , the network became congested and saw a 600% increase in pending transactions. This surge resulted in the network slowing down and expensive transactions fees, therefore, reducing the usability/viability of Ethereum applications. The solutions currently being developed to overcome the scaling issue include: Casper – The upgrade that will set to bring about Ethereum 2.0 and move Ethereum to a Proof-of-Stake protocol. It is expected to occur in 2019. Sharding – Splits up the entire network into separate ‘shards’. Each independent shard and its allocated nodes can process certain transactions, rather than the entire network processing each transaction, therefore, increasing throughput. Serenity – A new blockchain system that would be connected to Ethereum. The goal would be to move all the existing Ethereum applications here where they would be “sort of folded into a contract on one shard of the new system.” Proof of Stake vs. Proof of Work Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Work (PoW) are two popular types of blockchain consensus mechanisms. A consensus mechanism is used to verify and validate the information that’s being added to the blockchain ledger. This ensures that there is no double-spending or other invalid data is being added to the blockchain. It also prevents the networks from being harmed through constant forking. There are pros and cons to each consensus mechanism, but, they all aim to serve the same purpose. A primary difference between consensus mechanisms is how the verification of transactions are delegated and rewarded. Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake infographic by 3iQ Research Group Ethereum currently uses a Proof of Work system, but the Casper upgrade will start the transition of Ethereum to a Proof of Stake system . The new system will also have a penalty system built in to punish malicious actors. Good Audience state that: “The penalty system has the additional benefit of deterring 51% attacks. In a PoW system, a 51% attack is costly but repeatable as long as enough hashing power has been collected. With PoS, the attackers run the risk of losing their stake should the attack fail. In such a case, the only way to relaunch an attack would be to acquire new Ether.” Casper, Sharding & Ethereum 2.0 The roadmap to Ethereum 2.0 consists of two combined upgrades, which are Casper and Sharding, as is designed to bring scalability and security benefits to Ethereum. It may take several years for these both to be implemented fully and form Ethereum 2.0. Despite that Casper and Sharding will be combined to form Ethereum 2.0, both are separate projects that will have different phases and implementation and completion times. The Casper protocol is a proof of stake consensus mechanism that forms a major part of Ethereum 2.0 roadmap. With Casper, validators will have to set aside part of their Ether as a stake. When blocks are discovered by validators which they think should be added to the Ethereum blockchain (validated), they will make a bet on it in Ether. If the block is appended to the chain then the validators are rewarded based on their bet sizes. As mentioned above it will have built-in mechanisms for punishing malicious actors on the protocol which will ensure that they cannot game the system and that the system remains trustless. Validators acting badly will have their stakes removed. Sharding, on the other hand, will divide the network into separate shards. Each shard will be designated to process specific transactions, which it can do so on its own. Currently, the entire network is needed to process each transaction, which is likely an excessive use of the network’s resources. That’s why implementing sharding could significantly increase throughput on Ethereum and enable greater scaling. This is how Vitalik Buterin explains sharding: “Imagine that Ethereum has been split into thousands of islands. Each island can do its own thing. Each of the islands has its own unique features, and everyone is belonging on that island, i.e., the accounts, can interact with each other AND they can freely indulge in all its features. If they want to contact other islands, they will have to use some sort of protocol.” Conclusion Ethereum’s contribution to the blockchain/crypto world is enormous. Ethereum has opened up new possibilities with blockchain through the introduction of smart contracts, decentralized applications, and tokenized economies. There is no doubt that Ethereum is still a work in progress. It has some issues, especially those related to scaling and the solutions needed will not just come overnight. The future of Ethereum depends on how widely adopted and powerful the network becomes as well as the creativity and talent of the developers who use the platform. Ethereum indeed appears to be heading in the right direction, gaining the attention of many large corporations and institutions. The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance currently has over 386 members that support and back Ethereum related developments. Members include heavy hitters like Intel, JPMorgan, Microsoft, BP, and even the Indian Government. No one can predict for sure what impact Ethereum will have, just like in the 1990’s no one knew how much the internet would impact the world. It’s still early days for Ethereum, but it certainly has the potential to be a revolutionary platform.

This noteworthy increase aligns with the upward trend of Bitcoin’s value, adding to the cryptocurrency’s recent surge in popularity. A remarkable occurrence was the overnight rise of ORDI to an unprecedented all-time high, which injected excitement into its recent performance. Based on the Ordinals protocol of Bitcoin, the token is by far the largest BRC-20 asset. It reached a new peak price of $49.05 today, according to CoinGecko data, after rising 16.3% over the previous day and an astounding 148% over the previous seven days.

Furthermore, one important technical indication is to support the optimistic viewpoint. The 4-hour chart’s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) both show positive movements. ORDIUSD currently trading at $48.82 territory on the daily chart: TradingView.com Interestingly, the RSI reached 90.24, indicating an overbought state that can indicate a possible decline in price. On the other hand, the MACD’s bullish momentum suggests that there is still buyer interest and that the price will probably continue to rise. ORDI has had tremendous growth since its founding as a technical experiment on Bitcoin in early 2023. With a $903 million market capitalization, ORDI is the most valuable cryptocurrency by market valuation, ranking it 63rd overall and first within the BRC-20. Regarding social dominance, Santiment data indicates that ORDI has had an upward trend. ORDI Doubles In A Week Alongside Bitcoin’s 20-Month Highs ORDI’s recent surge, fueled by adoption from major exchanges like Binance and OKX, saw its largest increase in the past week, doubling in price. This coincided with Bitcoin reaching its highest point in 20 months, exceeding $42,000. Bitcoin’s 20% rise over the past month, currently at around $41,800, further emphasizes the synchronized momentum of both cryptocurrencies since ORDI’s launch.

21062946,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=563863,1701738025,"Bloomberg Expects Bitcoin Price To Surpass $500,000 In Upcoming Crypto Super Cycle","In a recent Bloomberg report, it has been suggested that the rise of Bitcoin price to over $42,000 is just the beginning of a new crypto super cycle that will push the world’s largest cryptocurrency to over $500,000. According to Bloomberg, proponents of this theory argue that Bitcoin represents a new monetary order that is captivating Wall Street and fueling a “palpable sense of euphoria” within the digital asset community. Bitcoin Price Potential Soars The remarkable performance of the Bitcoin price in recent months took many by surprise, as the cryptocurrency posted three consecutive monthly increases, including another 11 percent in December alone. The enthusiasm surrounding Bitcoin’s price rally has led to optimistic predictions of further gains, often based on intuition or technical analysis. The cryptocurrency has experienced a significant price revival in 2023, with its value surging over 150% thus far. Market observers attribute this surge to growing anticipation of a potential approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) for trading in the United States. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says It’s “Not Too Late” To Buy Ethereum, Here’s Why Per the report, the prospect of an ETF has led to jubilation within the industry. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong suggests that “Bitcoin may be the key to extending Western civilization.” Forecasts regarding the future price of Bitcoin have ranged from $50,000 in the immediate term to above $530,000. Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak & Co., cautions about the rapidly changing sentiment in the asset class, highlighting the importance of the liquidity influx caused by the pandemic in driving Bitcoin’s strong rally in 2020 and 2021. Maley suggests that without a similar liquidity injection, some of the optimistic predictions surrounding Bitcoin’s future value may be unrealistic. The long-awaited launch of a Bitcoin-based ETF in the United States aims to facilitate easier access to the cryptocurrency for money managers, potentially attracting billions of dollars in new investments to the space. BTC ETF Speculation Sparks Optimism Researchers at Kaiko note a noticeable shift in the market sentiment since mid-October, driven by increasing institutional interest in the potential approval of a spot BTC ETF and a more favorable macroeconomic environment. The researchers also highlight recent inflows into crypto investment products and a seven-month high in daily spot-trading volumes in November. Nevertheless, while excitement about a broader crypto rally often spreads across social media platforms like X (formerly known as Twitter), it is important to acknowledge Bitcoin’s historical volatility. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Open Interest Falls Behind General Crypto Market, What This Means For Price According to Bloomberg, the cryptocurrency has experienced multiple hype cycles in recent years, with celebrated gains followed by significant downturns. Despite Bitcoin’s recent gains and departure from a prolonged consolidation phase, Bloomberg suggests that a significant correction may still be on the horizon. At present, Bitcoin is trading at $41,800, displaying sustained bullish momentum as it strives to reclaim the $42,000 level. The outcome remains uncertain whether the cryptocurrency will successfully consolidate above this critical level, positioning it favorably for continued upward movement throughout the month. Alternatively, the current yearly high level could act as a formidable resistance barrier for the Bitcoin price, further supporting Bloomberg’s thesis of a potential correction.
