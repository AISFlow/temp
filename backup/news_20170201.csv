42399590,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjqKw,1485990005,Construct 2017: Experts Ask 'How Long Until Private Ledgers Go Live?,"Private blockchains are on the cusp of leaving the laboratory and heading to the real world.  At least, that's according to bold predictions from some of the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger projects's top technical minds during the second day of CoinDesk's developer conference, Construct 2017.  While today, most private blockchain and ledgers remain experimental (with some onlookers even starting to express skepticism that private blockchains will ever be rolled out), that uncertain state of affairs could be on the verge of change.  During the conference, many key Hyperledger technologists – those representing IBM, Intel, Digital Asset and R3CEV – updated the audience on the intricacies and the status of their contributions to the project.  Some even estimated that the projects may be moving into a more production-ready era – and soon.  Shaul Kfir, Digital Asset's chief technology officer, spoke of the startup's partnerships with big financial firms like ASX, DTCC and SIX.  ""They’ve taken the red pill of understanding that something really big is happening,"" he said.  Kfir went on to note that he thinks the technology is proceeding quickly in terms of adoption, telling attendees:  ""We’re continuing to build production solutions as fast as we can. I believe we’ll see them within the next one or two years.""  Other speakers shared a similar sentiment, in that the timeline to broader adoption may boil down to as little as two years. Standing in the way is continued R&D – and the expected scrutiny from enterprises – on those projects.  Yet certain developments, notably DTCC's announcement that it aims to put $11tn of worth of assets on a distributed ledger, may ultimately spark a sense of innovative urgency among some of those involved.  R3 associate director Clemens Wan gave a similar estimate for the company’s open-source ledger, Corda. He told attendees that, for Corda, 2017 will be ""the year of the pilot"", with 2018 predicted to be when R3's distributed ledger hits production scale.  Christopher Ferris, IBM's Open Technology CTO, didn't offer his own long-term predictions, but he said that Fabric's 1.0 architecture is expected to be ready by March of this year.  Toward inclusion  Given the number of projects represented at the event, it's no surprise that developers expressed interest in testing applications on more than one platform.  It's that sentiment that is promoting an atmosphere of collaboration, according to attendees, including Viktor Nikolenko, SWIFT Integration Manager at IntellectEU Portugal, a financial integration partner.  According to Nikolenko, that cooperative environment is very much in play.  ”It’s nice to see that everyone is moving in more or less the same direction to cooperate and not just do it on their own,” he told CoinDesk.  Nikolenko, who’s been working on integrating Fabric, went on to highlight one problem: Many companies are bound by non-disclosure agreements, which in most instances would prohibit the free flow of information between sides that might not otherwise communicate so openly.  ""It’s great to have an open source part to this where we can cooperate and bring solutions that will become standards, otherwise we would be fragmented,"" he explained.  Nikolenko, like those behind the Hyperledger projects, wants to see an open-source ledger layer upon which companies can build proprietary applications, using the Internet as a metaphor.  ""You need HTTP and the Internet to do that. It’s the same. We need a way to communicate between all the ledgers and all the distributed systems,"" he argued.  Public and private, hand-in-hand  Amidst the discussions, another trend emerged: the idea that enterprises could benefit from tapping both private and public blockchains, with each kind of network aligning with certain use cases.  ConsenSys founder Joseph Lubin’s presentation focused on the enterprise applications of ethereum.  During remarks, he went as far as to say:  ""It’s my thesis that every company that is building a blockchain will have a use case for public blockchain.""  Like Nikolenko, he made comparisons to the Internet.  ""Just like it took 10 years for the web to gain traction. It was an Intranet for a while. Five-to-six years will stay like that until we put private systems on the blockchain,"" he added.  Echoing that sentiment, Intel principal architect Mic Bowman, who is working on the Hyperledger framework known as Sawtooth Lake, remarked that both styles have a role to play.  ""We started working on it as dichotomy between private and public blockchains,"" he noted. ""But, we realized not one thing is sufficient for both applications. We have a very different expectation for distribution of authority.""  It's this philosophy that he said informed Sawtooth Lake's foundational basis as a plug-and-play framework that allows companies to select their own underlying consensus model, whether it's based along the lines of bitcoin or another model.  Still, as far as interoperability goes, others at the event argued that many Hyperledger participants might be looking too far ahead.  Intel's Dan Middleton said that he thinks it's too early to think about creating bridges between ledgers, for example.  Further experimentation with different open-source implementations is needed, he argued, in a bid to find the use cases in which they might be best utilized.

42399576,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjqB6,1485981314,UAE Central Bank: We Are Not Banning Bitcoin,"The Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has clarified past statements about a prohibition on “virtual currencies”, confirming that new rules released last month don’t apply to bitcoin.  As reported by CoinDesk  at the time, the UAE central bank released a digital payments framework on 1st January. That policy document included the stipulation that ""all virtual currencies (and any transactions thereof) are prohibited"", prompting questions about both the definition of ""virtual currency"" the central bank was relying on as well as the exact scope and nature of the ostensible prohibition.  New comments suggest that, at least for now, the central bank isn’t taking any action on bitcoin or other digital currencies.  In a statement released to regional news service Gulf News, central bank governor Mubarak Al Mansouri said:  ""These regulations do not cover 'virtual currency' which is defined as any type of digital unit used as a medium of exchange, unit account, or a form of stored value. In this context, these regulations do not apply to bitcoin or other crypto - currencies, currency exchanges, or underlying technology such as blockchain.""  That said, the central bank indicated that the topic of digital currencies remains an open question – and one that could be subject to new rules in the future.  ""This area is currently under review by the Central Bank and new regulations will be issued as appropriate,"" Al Mansouri remarked.  As can be expected, those working in the region’s nascent digital currency ecosystem quickly praised the move.  ""We're optimistic about the direction the Central Bank have been recently taking to support innovation in fintech in UAE,"" Ola Doudin, CEO of bitcoin exchange service BitOasis, told CoinDesk.

42399567,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjq5C,1485974048,IBM: Nine in 10 Government Execs Plan to Invest in Blockchain By 2018,"Many of the government leaders queried by IBM in a recent survey say they want to put blockchain to work in the public sector.  Out of 200 government executives from 16 different countries worldwide polled, 14% say they expect to utilize production-grade blockchains sometime this year. Forty-eight percent anticipate launches of their own between now and 2020. The remaining 38% indicated that they would take a wait-and-see approach, putting off their own use of the tech until past 2020.  Among the use cases cited in the report, asset management and identity management were cited as the most compelling by government leaders. Of those looking to integrate blockchain into their government services in the next year, 45% said they want to invest in asset management capabilities, with another 45% highlighting digital identity as a key area of investment.  Overall, the results indicate a bullish sentiment on blockchain use for government services.  As IBM noted in its survey report:  “For example, nine in ten government organizations plan to invest in blockchain for use in financial transaction management, asset management, contract management and regulatory compliance by 2018. And seven in ten government executives predict blockchain will significantly disrupt the area of contract management, which is often the intersection of the public and private sectors.”  In a way, the survey results reinforce some of the news developments seen over the past year.  For example, the government in the UK began testing a blockchain-based welfare payments system last year – though some privacy advocates voiced criticism at the time. In early 2016, the UK Government Office for Science pressed other agencies to consider how to apply the tech to their own practices.  Elsewhere, government offices in Russia and Dubai, among other places, have explored applications of their own.

42399566,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjq3E,1485970813,Gemini Speeds Up Deposits to Bypass Bitcoin Network Congestion,"Digital currency exchange Gemini is doing away with transaction confirmations for approved customers.  Announced yesterday, the move will see the New York-based exchange, founded by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, begin crediting users for their bitcoin deposits before those transactions have been confirmed on the network.  Typically, most services will wait for at least three to six confirmations before accepting a deposit as genuine. Bitcoin transactions, after being included in an initial block, become ""confirmed"" as new blocks are added to the transaction history.  Now, Gemini – citing transaction delays on the bitcoin network due to congestion – is starting to credit users before the first confirmation, assuming they pass a new clearance system.  The exchange explained:  ""Here’s how it works: we’re running every bitcoin deposit on Gemini through a proprietary analysis to determine how likely it is to get confirmed, even if the network is clogged with other transactions. If your transaction passes our criteria (which may take a few minutes), we’ll pre-credit the amount of your deposit and make it available for trading immediately.""  The move comes months after Gemini began expanding its services to Asian markets. The exchange opened its doors in late 2015 following approval by New York state regulators.  The bid to offer zero-confirmation deposits is the latest move from the firm as it seeks to attract more traders – something it has struggled with since launch.  According to bitcoin data service provider Bitcoinity, Gemini has seen roughly 1,900 BTC in trade volume over the past 24 hours.

42399572,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjq89,1485965448,Switzerland Wants to Open a Sandbox to Attract More Blockchain Startups,"Switzerland’s government is considering new regulations in light of fintech advancements such as blockchain, with the aim of creating a more welcoming atmosphere for startups working in the space.  The Swiss Federal Council – a seven-member group that serves as the country’s collective head of government – said today that it is seeking consultations on regulatory changes for the domestic financial industry to account for fintech.  Specifically, the government is proposing that firms that accept less than 1m Swiss francs in deposits (just over $1m USD) be classified differently than other institutions – a move that would create a so-called ""regulatory sandbox"" within which startups could experiment with new technologies. The Federal Council is also eyeing changes to licensure requirements below a certain depositary threshold.  While the statement was light on details about when such changes would be put in place, the Council indicated that it would draft possible changes as needed.  The Council noted:  ""Due to the rapidly progressing digitisation in the financial sector, in particular in the blockchain area, it can be assumed that business models will develop which are not yet conceivable today. The Federal Council will follow these developments closely also in the future and will swiftly propose the necessary regulatory adjustments if required.""  The development is the latest indication that Swizterland’s government wants to attract blockchain startups.  The country is already home to a number of startups in the ecosystem, with some of those companies specifically citing a more permissive regulatory environment. Preliminary approval for bitcoin wallet service Xapo to operate in the country, announced last week, highlighted the kind of accommodation taking place.  Others, including railyway operator SBB as well as a consortium of Swiss business including its major telecom provider, have also pursued deployments of the tech.

42399583,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjqG1,1485958499,Abu Dhabi Bank Partners with Ripple for Cross-Border Payments,"Abu Dhabi’s largest bank has begun offering a new cross-border transaction service in partnership with distributed ledger startup Ripple.  The National Bank of Abu Dhabi (NBAD), the emirate’s biggest bank and one of the largest in the UAE, said today that it has integrated Ripple’s technology into its own systems, allowing for intrabank transfers for NBAD customers.  Vineet Varma, NBAD’s managing director and head of global transaction banking, said in a statement:  “We’re always exploring new ways to enhance our customers’ experience. With blockchain, we hope that we could address the needs of our customers and drive forward more efficient and flexible service. Embracing technologies like blockchain is a step in right direction for our customers.”  The announcement is perhaps the most notable development around the tech to emerge from Abu Dhabi to date.  The bank is the first of its kind within the Middle East to offer a service based on distributed ledger tech. It follows moves by regulators in the emirate to attract blockchain startups to the region. Enterprises such as the Abu Dhabi Stock Exchange have also explored concepts like blockchain-based voting.

42427307,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1Pzh,1485957640,To Catch a Ransomer: How the FBI Chases Crime on the Blockchain,"FBI special agent Joseph Battaglia sits at a desk between a New York police detective and an employee of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  Charged with helping oversee investigations at the New York field office of the FBI's cyber division, Battaglia and his colleagues have developed methods for identifying a wide range of online criminal activities, ranging from the use of child porn to espionage.  But during a recent keynote address at Fordham University’s law school in New York City, Battaglia peeled back the curtain of a different kind of investigation. Addressing a group of about 150 law students and others attending the inaugural blockchain initiative hosted by IBM and the university, Battaglia gave a step-by-step account of how he identifies the criminals using cryptocurrency ransomware.  The key to overcoming a range of hurdles in this process, he said, is collaboration between a few key public and private organizations and some 'outside the box' thinking.  Speaking during the keynote address, Battaglia told the audience:  ""I can use all these methods to actually identify my subject when my investigation started with nothing more than a complaint from a victim who had a bitcoin address that hadn’t been used on the blockchain yet.""  Everything, Battaglia detailed, begins with a single user opening his or her computer and discovering they’ve received an email informing them their files have been locked with ""military grade encryption"" and won’t be released unless they pay a ransom.  Seventy-five percent of the time that ransom request is denominated in bitcoin, he said, but other cryptocurrencies that have been used include litecoin and the increasingly popular monero.  Typically, the ransom note will include instructions on buying and spending the cryptocurrency of choice.  To pay or not to pay?  At that point, the victim has to decide if they’re going to pay or not.  Though the FBI doesn’t encourage people to give into such demands, Battaglia explained that professional files are sometimes compromised, leaving the victim little choice but to hand over the funds to be able to continue with crucial business.  So pervasive are such attacks that, in 2016, data security firm Citrix published a report showing that small businesses were stockpiling bitcoin in case of a ransom demand. The same year, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funded the development of a bitcoin analysis tool specifically aimed at ransomware.  But even if the victim decides not to pay, the FBI has ways to identify the scope of the attack and the identity of the perpetrator, even on an unused bitcoin address.  ""Because the address hasn't been used yet on the bitcoin blockchain,"" said Battaglia, ""there’s not going to be any information I can get on the blockchain yet. But I can take the ransom note and plug it into IC3.""  Founded in 2000, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) accepts reports of alleged cyber crimes including theft of intellectual property, corporate espionage and “online extortion” or ransomware.  In September, IC3 published a statement encouraging victims to report ransomware incidents to the FBI, adding that, in the first several months of last year, ""global ransomware infections were at an all-time high"".  IC3 received over 8,000 complaints in 2015, with a total reported loss of about $275m.  Even if a ransom isn’t paid, Battaglia indicated that his team will compare the ransom demand with those on file at IC3 to look for connections. In similar cases with similar demands, some victims may have decided to pay the ransom, resulting in possibly helpful data for the cases in which the ransom was not paid.  Addresses from victims who did pay are then processed by the FBI’s ""blockchain tool"" to generate a list of wallets associated with the same ""entity"" that issued the ransom demand. From the initial pool of addresses that paid, the FBI then searches for connections between the recipient wallet and its expenditures.  While initial data may be limited, as more of the funds are spent the tool accumulates more data, including from 'change addresses' that return satoshis or other denominations to the original recipient wallet.  ""I might find that those transactions occur within another cluster of bitcoin addresses that I don’t know anything about,"" said Battaglia, ""and my analysis tool doesn’t know anything about. But I can take those addresses, pull them out, plug them into our case management system.""  The same but different  When running the cluster of bitcoin addresses through the FBI’s case management system, Battaglia said he’ll be looking for cases being worked by other agents who have gathered additional identifiable information.  For example, this could be an FBI agent who is working with a ""cooperator on a darknet marketplace"" and who knows that the funds associated with the addresses are also associated with someone selling extremely popular remote desktop protocol (RDP) credentials for accessing third-party computers from anywhere in the world.  ""So now, we have an idea of what’s going on with the ransomware and maybe how the intruder got into the victims’ computers,"" said Battaglia.  With that information, FBI investigators would then return to the original victim to see if an RDP was being run on his or her computer, and if so, what IP addresses appear in the computer’s logs.  The FBI will look not only for addresses unknown to the victim, but for known addresses being accessed by users who don’t normally log in, or who are logging in during unusual times.  While this information might initially give the victim a way to minimize further attack by changing their login credentials, it won’t necessarily provide much more information about the perpetrator, ""So I’ll continue to look on the blockchain and try to find connections to other wallets or clusters of addresses,"" he said.  Battaglia would now likely start looking for connections across time, such as a monthly payment made from one of the suspicious bitcoin addresses to a bitcoin exchange in the US, on which he could serve a subpoena to learn what the transactions have been paying for.  Once the payment recipient is identified, the investigator will have an IP address of a virtual server with a name and address ""that’s probably fake,"" he said. ""I expect it to be fake.""  The hustle  At that point, the investigation gets old school.  Battaglia said he would next implement ""traditional"" investigative techniques, like cross-referencing the addresses on an IP registry, such as the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) or the Global IP Address Database, to try to identify which connections are being made to the server.  But all that is for naught if the perpetrator has successfully logged into an identity-protecting virtual private network, or VPN.  Last year, Globalwebindex reported that one in four users accessed a VPN daily, with 70% of respondents accessing weekly. In the US, India, and Malaysia, the numbers are even higher, reaching one in three users accessing an identity obscuring VPN daily.  Also of concern to crimefighters, are increasingly sophisticated bitcoin mixers that obscure bitcoin sources and were last week cracked down on in a joint initiative between Europol, Interpol and the Basel Institute on Governance. Developments in cryptocurrency technologies are also an issue; for example, monero, a privacy-enhancing altcoin that doesn’t need to be mixed to be obscured.  ""But people get sloppy,"" Battaglia said.  Evidence of a ransomer who has stopped paying attention to details could include them connecting to the Internet via public Wi-Fi hotspots, relying on the large volume of people at the location to provide a smoke screen to obscure their identity.  The special agent said:  ""Through the researchers we have at the bureau, we can then pare through all that data, pare through the databases ... and track subjects very similar to the ones I just described.""  Beyond the FBI, beyond bitcoin  Founded at FBI headquarters in 2002, the cyber division now splits its work roughly equally between national security cases and criminal cases, according to Battaglia.  To increase its likelihood of success even further, the organization is comprised of squads scattered around the US, and has partnerships with other agencies, including state police, the IRS, the secret service, and “detectives from all sorts of different law enforcement agencies"", he explained.  Battaglia also mentioned partnerships with members of the private sector, which help identify access points used by criminals; ""cooperatives"" that have got into trouble in the past and later joined investigations as ""independent researchers""; and legal attaches around the world.  One of the FBI’s most prominent partners is the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which in 2014 helped bring bitcoin into mainstream use when it declared bitcoin exchanges are legally considered money transmitters and need to be licensed as such.  In the future, however, Battaglia said he’s prepared for investigations into applications of blockchain technology beyond just cryptocurrency.  So long as the technology to support a wide range of possible assets includes considerations allowing it to be ""audited and inspected properly"", Battaglia said ""the fact that everything is recorded in a public ledger that’s permanent and not modifiable is very good from an evidence collection perspective"".  The human factor  While the FBI has received its share of criticism for having difficulty solving ransomware cases, blockchain analysis startup Chainalysis last year predicted an increase in arrests due to new high-tech partnerships.  But it is at the intersection between high-tech tools and old-fashioned investigation that Battaglia’s boss, supervisory special agent Jay Kramer, thinks the FBI has to continue to improve.  Speaking from the audience at the event, Kramer said that the FBI recognizes the old days of getting ""access to content"" through wiretaps are largely over.  ""We recognize we’re not going to have access to encrypted communications on iPhones, we’re just not going to,” Kramer said. ""So what are we doing? Are we just going to wait for a technological solution? No.""  Kramer stressed that the FBI must redouble its efforts to develop human resources:  ""People who want to report to the FBI the things that they have to offer. The co-conspirator of a bad actor who’s just going to give us that private key, as opposed to us trying some technological means to get the private key.""

Speaking at CoinDesk's Construct 2017 conference in San Francisco yesterday, CEO Brian Hoffman and senior developer Chris Pacia revealed new details about both the project's user traction and the features that will be built into upcoming version, dubbed OpenBazaar 2.0.  In remarks, the developers said they plan to integrate the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to boost store uptime, improve dispute resolution and inventory management, and bolster third-party search, while offering online store support, offline purchases and Tor integration.  Ultimately, Hoffman offered an optimistic outline of the usability of the platform, which opened to users in April 2016.  Hoffman told the audience:  ""Our goal with OpenBazaar 2.0 is to get it to be, with the exception of using bitcoin, ... an identical experience of what you’d see on Etsy. I think the 2.0 [version] is close to that.""  Among the biggest priorities, Hoffman said, remains improving the platform's search functionalities so that, even despite the distributed nature of the e-commerce site, it offers an experience more akin to centralized services like Google.  ""Most of the time, search is highly optimized, but in a decentralized network, you have to try to get the data off all the nodes. It can be slow and challenging,” he said.  In what would emerge as a pattern for the day, Hoffman also faced sometimes pointed questions from an expert audience that sought to discern how the platform was adapting to the relative lack of adoption seen by bitcoin more broadly.  ""The idea of using cryptocurrency all the time is still foreign to most people. I would say we're three to five years away at minimum,"" he said.  Overall, Hoffman said the roadmap outlined did not have a hard deadline, but that he believes it will be available in the next few months. The project, first announced in 2014, now claims 400,000 downloads, 300 merchants and 10,000 listings.  The project has to date raised $4m in funding from BlueYard, Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures – $3m of which was announced in a December 2016 round.  The latest details come six months after OpenBazaar’s main development startup, OB1, first announced it had begun work on a 2.0 release.

42427318,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1QBh,1485950408,Identity Startup Cambridge Blockchain Closes $2 Million Funding,"Blockchain identity startup Cambridge Blockchain has finished raising $2m in a funding round backed by VC firms Partech Ventures and Digital Currency Group.  The investment comes just over a year after Cambridge Blockchain nabbed the top spot at a blockchain startup competition hosted by Banco Santander’s venture capital arm, which included a $15,000 prize.  CoinDesk reported last week that the Massachusetts-based company was in the process of raising capital.  In interview, CEO Matthew Commons said that the startup plans to use the funding to fuel ongoing technology pilots being conducted with some of its clients. While declining at this time to name the companies involved, he described them as ""major financial institutions"".  Commons told CoinDesk:  “We want to get through some pilots and get to commercial deployments by late 2017, so that’s really the goal. In order to do that, there’s salaries, rent, legal expenses, and things like that.”  Focus on compliance  According to Commons, the startup is targeting a major pain point for the financial institutions it hopes to do business with: compliance.  He argued that, today, banks wind up in a position in which they spend time and resources conducting what are essentially redundant checks on customer identity.  “The real problem these institutions have is that they’re spending a lot of money on the know-your-customer check process,” he said. “Sometimes it can be hundreds of millions of dollars for large bank that they spend on compliance.  The CEO cited the European General Data Protection Regulation, a series of regulatory provisions in the EU that will come into force in mid-2018. This will harmonize data protection rules across the economic block, seeking to put control of data back in the hands of the user, while also sharpening the rules for the firms responsible for handling that information.  Commons said that the pending rules have “been one of the big drivers for our technology”.  “They’ve been a big catalyst for what we’re doing,” he went on to say. “These new rules can have penalties for data privacy violations up to 4% of worldwide revenue, so it’s really a big deal.”  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Cambridge Blockchain.

42427328,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1QTh,1485946820,R3 Director: 2017 is the Year of the DLT Pilot,"While DLT technologies are moving slowly toward production, an executive from blockchain consortium R3 is hinting that this might not be the defining trend for enterprises this year.  In remarks yesterday at CoinDesk’s developer conference, Construct 2017, R3 associate director and former Credit Suisse blockchain architect, Clemens Wan, predicted that 2017 will be defined by DLT pilots, while 2018 will see the technology migrate to production.  The comments come just months after the open-source release of its custom distributed ledger technology (DLT), Corda, became a part of the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger blockchain project’s collection of enterprise technologies.  Since then, R3 said it has attracted more than 600 users to its slack channel, and more than 19,000 visitors to its website, Corda.net, as it seeks to reach its next milestone, the release of a test version of its DLT system in the first or second quarter.  In this light, Wan framed R3’s technology as one that requires broader buy-in from enterprises and corporates to achieve a strong network effect and top-level applications.  Wan said:  ""Corda is the Xbox Live, it’s the ecosystem, it’s the connectivity. We want to focus on the platform and services.""  Wan was also frank about R3’s transition from a membership consortium and laboratory to this new model, tracing the startup’s path from using ethereum for specific use cases to becoming a more general technology provider.  Elsewhere, Wan noted that R3 is exploring use cases that enable it to work closely with outside parties, such as central banks that may want to issue their own blockchain or DLT-powered digital currencies and trusted market data providers that would deliver data in these cryptographic environments.  Still, Wan also sought to shift the definition of the startup, which has recently found itself in the spotlight of late for key member departures and a long-running funding round that has continued for some time without a formal closure.  Notably, Wan did not describe Corda as a blockchain system, a comment that illustrates the increasing issues many in the industry have with the terminology.  Wan said:  ""We found that we didn't want a blockchain, we wanted to be blockchain inspired.""
