In an announcement of its second quarter earnings Thursday afternoon, the graphics card maker's CFO, Colette Kress, stated that while ""GPU business revenue was $2.66 billion, up 40 percent from a year earlier,"" it was ""down 4 percent sequentially.""  At the time, she said that record performance in gaming, professional visualization and datacenter services ""offset"" a substantial decline in the sale of cryptocurrency GPUs.  She added:  ""Our revenue outlook had anticipated cryptocurrency-specific products declining to approximately $100 million, while actual crypto-specific product revenue was $18 million. Whereas we had previously anticipated cryptocurrency to be meaningful for the year, we are now projecting no contributions going forward.""  The chip producer has seen GPU demand rise over the last year, largely due to cryptocurrency miners. Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said in March that the company needed to ramp up its production to ensure that both miners and gamers had sufficient graphics cards.  That being said, the company has downplayed the actual impact mining demand has had on its financials. Kress said it was ""hard to quantify"" how much of its business came from miners versus traditional markets.  During a previous earnings call, an Nvidia representative said the company modeled cryptocurrency profits ""approximately flat,"" adding that much of the demand for its graphics cards came from the number of ""amazing games that are out right now.""

42401773,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2TuP,1534449639,Genesis Mining to End Unprofitable Crypto Contracts,"Cloud mining service Genesis Mining is forcing some clients to upgrade to a five-year subscription or else lose services, it announced Thursday.  The Iceland-based startup said in a blog post that it will end open-ended contracts for customers who are not earning enough to cover maintenance fees in roughly two months due to the ongoing declining cryptocurrency market. Clients who wish to retain services must upgrade to a new premium account.  Mining is getting more complicated and energy-intensive, the company said, forcing it to reconsider its policies. Now, all users will have to switch to a five-year contract with no option for early termination. The fee for every trillion hashes per second (TH/s) will drop to $180 however, down from $285.  The company said:  ""Unfortunately, bitcoin went into a downward trend around January. This trend combined with the heavily rising difficulty around April and May reduced mining outputs even further. As a result, some user contracts are now mining less than the daily maintenance fee requires to be covered, and thus they entered the 60 days grace period, after which open-ended contracts will get terminated.""  Nor is Genesis Mining the first firm to find mining for certain customers unprofitable – in June, Hashflare announced that it was shutting down its bitcoin mining operations and cancelling users' contracts, because ""the payouts were lower than maintenance for 28 consecutive days,"" according to its official Facebook page.

42401784,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2U4F,1534444811,California Is Open to Allowing Crypto Political Donations,"Candidates for public office in California may soon be able to accept cryptocurrencies as donations.  The California Fair Political Practices Commission met on Thursday to discuss a number of election issues facing the Golden State, including whether candidates for public office can accept cryptocurrencies as part of campaign donations.  Ultimately, the commissioners didn't make a decision to adopt any of the proposed amendments during the hearing, acknowledging that they don't understand the issue fully. Back in 2014, the Federal Election Commission ruled that federal election law allows for candidates to accept cryptocurrencies like bitcoin as an in-kind donation.  During the hearing on Thursday, chairwoman Alice Germond indicated that a set definition for a ""cryptocurrency"" is needed, remarking:  ""I would be inclined to think that bitcoin is a thing that is not U.S. money but is more like a currency, like the euro. But I would like to hear more to develop my thinking on this.""  More time to study  A public comment from Nicolas Heidorn – policy and legal director of the nonpartisan political advocacy organization California Common Cause – suggested not allowing cryptocurrency donations until the commission has further studied the matter. In the end, the commissioners disagreed with the idea.  Commissioner Allison Hayward, in particular, pushed back against the idea of banning cryptocurrencies as donations outright, saying that she would like to gather more information before making a decision.  ""I think cryptocurrencies are obviously new and designed to be confidential but the blockchain technology I think might ultimately be a very robust tool in tracing activity,"" Hayward said, adding:  ""I don't think we're there yet, but I would hate for something we do to forestall that later on. I don't know what that would be but … blockchain might be a very useful tool for us and I'd hate to prevent that.""  Commissioners Brian Hatch and Frank Cardenas both said they disagreed with the concept of an outright ban, but in the case of Hatch, the issue of fraud remains a paramount one. He raised the prospect of a candidate claiming a crypto-donation that came from within the state, when, in reality, it actually had a different point of origin.  The commissioners came to a brief agreement that a cap of roughly $100 per donation may be appropriate for this year's midterm elections. The commission would then be able to continue studying the matter in 2019, when there wouldn't be an immediate election to consider.  However, this suggestion was not formally adopted during Thursday's meeting. The commission will meet again next month to discuss the issue.

Dominic Stevens, managing director and CEO of ASX Limited – the exchange's operator – explained how using distributed ledger technology (DLT) in place of its existing Clearing House Electronic Subregister System (CHESS), would offer greater efficiency than CHESS does in transmitting messages and accessing information.  At present equity clearing and settlement costs the industry roughly $100 million alone, and the total cost of all communications and other issues to the ""super industry"" is closer to $23 billion, Stevens said. Moving to DLT ""will provide tremendous value by being a great business enabler for our customers, and a significant enabler of innovation for issuers and investors.""  ""All day every day, participants send messages back and forth to the CHESS database to make sure they are perfectly reconciled with it. This process is prone to errors and expensive to fix. The databases of participants can also be different, meaning there are multiple versions of software essentially doing the same thing,"" he said during a presentation.  These are problems that a distributed ledger can solve, he added.  With the new system, participants will run nodes instead of sending messages, and connect to the whole database instead of having many ""disparate databases,"" which will help to eliminate errors. However, those customers who don't want to run nodes will still be able to receive messages ""in a similar fashion to how they do today.""  ASX announced earlier this year that it was seeking feedback on its proposal to use DLT in place of CHESS, and Stevens confirmed Thursday that the exchange is looking to roll the system out by the end of 2020.  The platform is based on technology by Digital Asset Holdings, of which ASX is a partial owner. In the future, it can operate not only for the equities, but potentially also settle of bonds or other asset classes, he said.

42401777,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2TyL,1534436771,Judge Issues Default Judgment in ICO Fraud Lawsuit,"CORRECTION (8/16/18): This article has been amended to reflect that the default judgment named Monkey Capital LLC and Monkey Capital Inc., not Daniel Harrison. CoinDesk regrets the error.      A federal judge has ruled against a blockchain startup after finding that several victims were defrauded out of potentially more than $1 million in cryptocurrencies.  U.S. District Judge Donald Middlebrooks, of the Southern District of Florida, entered a ""final default judgment"" against Monkey Capital LLC and Monkey Capital Inc. on Tuesday after finding that a working product was never delivered after the token sale was conducted.  Moreover, the judge found fund were not returned to the plaintiffs despite being asked to do so prior to the case's filing.  A default judgment is entered when a party has ""failed to plead or otherwise defend against an action,"" according to the ruling.  In his ruling, the judge noted:  ""Plaintiffs commenced this action against defendants, alleging they contributed cryptocurrency worth millions of dollars in advance of a scheduled initial coin offering (ICO) and supposed launch of a private cryptocurrency exchange and decentralized hedge fund (the 'Monkey Capital Market'). Plaintiffs state that the ICO never occurred, the status of the development of the Monkey Capital Market is unknown and that defendants unlawfully pocketed investor money.""  The judge found these charges credible, writing ""defendants have utilized plaintiffs' cryptocurrency to cover defendants' own business expenses and enrich themselves. As a result of defendants' conversion of plaintiffs' cryptocurrency to their own corporate and personal use, plaintiffs have suffered damage.""  The plaintiffs are seeking roughly $1.2 million in damages combined, but Middlebrooks wrote that he would like to confirm how the damages are being calculated.  A footnote in the ruling adds that at present, each plaintiff described which cryptocurrencies and how many tokens were sent during the sale, with victims sending bitcoin, waves, mobilego and ethereum tokens. The plaintiffs then calculated the damages by using the cryptocurrencies' price based on CoinMarketCap on July 13, 2018.  This hearing will take place on August 24.  In a statement, David Silver, the attorney for the plaintiffs, told CoinDesk that ""In recognizing the fraud perpetrated by the defendants -- and by holding them accountable for the to-be-determined monetary sum to be awarded to my clients -- the Court has made a new mark on an old law that is positive for investors who lose money in fraudulently and illegally promoted ICOs.""  He added:  ""Among other things, the Court determined that the products sold in the ICO were ""securities"" and that the defendants violated federal securities laws in connection with those sales. Even in a 'novel' area such as cryptocurrency investing, certain age-old standards hold true. Misrepresenting facts to investors to steal their money will not be tolerated.""

At time of writing, ETC is trading across exchanges at an average price of $14.04 – a 15.72 percent gain in the last 24 hours – and is currently the biggest gainer among the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap data.  This is not the first time that ETC is cheering its association with Coinbase – itrose sharply earlier this month to a high of $21.25 as traders welcomed its listing on Coinbase Pro, the firm's platform aimed at more experienced traders.  However, things took turn for the worse in subsequent days courtesy of a broader market sell-off and ETC fell to $10.25 on Aug. 14 – down 50 percent from its Aug. 7 high, as per Bitfinex.  Although the markets generally are now showing signs of recovery, today's above average bounce surely marks revived investor interest on the Coinbase news, and leaves the cryptocurrency printing a 36 percent gain since the low set two days ago.  Hourly chart  The spike in ETC looks sustainable as it is backed by a pick-up in trading volumes. However, both the relative strength index and stochastic are reporting overbought conditions, so further upside will likely unfold after a minor pullback.  Daily chart  The tide has turned in favor of the bulls, as per the bullish doji reversal seen on the daily chart.  What's more, the stochastic witnessed a bull cross earlier this week and is now rising from the oversold territory in favor of the bulls. A similar action is unfolding on the RSI.  View  ETC has likely witnessed a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change this week and looks set to test the 50-day moving average hurdle of $16.15 in the next few days. Acceptance above the key MA would only bolster the bullish setup.  The bullish case would weaken if prices drop below $12.00 (June 10 low).

Announced Thursday, Bittrex, Bitso and Coins.ph will now serve as Ripple's ""preferred digital asset exchanges"" as part of its efforts to build out the XRP ecosystem.  Cory Johnson, Ripple's chief markets strategist, told CoinDesk that the firm is essentially encouraging all of its clients in the U.S., Mexico and the Philippines to use those three exchanges, respectively, for sending funds using its xRapid service.  ""So in the U.S. we're saying the gold standard, our official partner is Bittrex. So any bank can go to Bittrex and have guaranteed liquidity on the spot, trade their dollars for XRP, zip over to Mexico to Bitso, our preferred partner there, and convert [to Mexican pesos],"" he said in an interview.  The financial institutions would need to have accounts with the exchanges to convert U.S. dollars, or Mexican or Philippine pesos, according to Johnson.  The three exchanges were chosen due to their XRP holdings, allowing them to provide higher levels of liquidity, he said, adding that ""there's a whole bunch of companies around the world that are using XRP and what we're doing is identifying three other [exchanges] that have a lot of XRP liquidity and steering more liquidity their way.""  While Ripple has only announced three exchanges so far, Johnson said more names are to follow.  He explained:  ""The corridors we're focused on [are] organic ... we want to focus on busy corridors. We want to focus on places where there's a very vibrant XRP marketplace, and we want to focus on places where we can have the most value.""  Ripple needs to determine where these places are, he said.

42401793,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2UC7,1534424443,Plz No Cat: The Future of Crypto Disputes Is Being Decided By Doges,"Could you sneak a cat past the doges?  That's the idea behind a new game launched by Kleros, an ethereum-based startup that raised $2.5 million in the first round of its crypto token sale in July. Called ""Doges on Trial,"" the game is designed around the principle of crypto-economics: the theory that a properly designed system of incentives based on cryptocurrency tokens will yield the desired user behavior.  In this case, Kleros wants to incentivize people using the platform to curate a list of images ... of doges.  For the uninitiated, ""doge"" is a meme of an apprehensive-looking Shiba Inu. It's captivated the internet, giving birth to a particular method of mangling English (""so scare,"" ""why this happened""), as well as a dedicated cryptocurrency, dogecoin, whose community is known for its playful antics.  So, while you might expect ""Doges on Trial"" to be much the same – just a fun activity to bring some lightheartedness to crypto – actually Kleros has much bigger, more serious use cases in mind for its decentralized dispute resolution protocol.  For instance, spotting fake news, resolving disputes on gig economy and e-commerce platforms, and helping ratings platforms curate their lists are all within the scope of Kleros' mission.  The company's founder and CEO Federico Ast told CoinDesk:  ""We want to fill this need for the crypto ecosystem that's going to be very useful for mass adoption.""  And needed it is. Recently dispute resolution, or more broadly governance, has been top of mind for many blockchain entrepreneurs and enthusiasts – especially for a new rash of protocols, think EOS, whose methods for making decisions that affect many stakeholders are opaque, to say the least.  Rather than building their own dispute resolution mechanisms, though, Ast hopes projects will delegate that aspect to Kleros.  And the way that Kleros, which is participating in the Thomson Reuters Incubator program right now, is proving it has the right crypto economics for the job is by running a cute little game in which users are rewarded for slipping forbidden cat images into a collection of doges.  The goal, Ast said, is ""to have as many people as possible coming to test this and trying to break it"" through bribery and other methods that bad actors would inevitably try to use against Kleros if it were deployed for higher-stakes purposes.  Remaining relatively quiet about the game that debuted on ethereum's live blockchain, or ""mainnet,"" in July, the company is now ready to start communicating the system's effectiveness to the broader ethereum community, said Ast.  Plz no cat  Backing up, it's worth noting how the doge proof-of-concept has worked.  Over the course of the past couple months, a few dozen users, mostly investors in the platform's native token, pinakion (PNK), have submitted more than 100 images for judgment and selection.  It works like this: a user submits their image – a doge, cat or otherwise – to the list along with a deposit of ether, ethereum's native token. The image sits in limbo for a day, during which time other users can challenge it by submitting an ether deposit equal to the submitter's.  If no one challenges it, the image is added to the list and the submitter's deposit is returned.  At the end of the trial (for which no date has yet been set), successful meme-submitters will split a reward of 1 million dogecoin.  If the image is challenged – because it lacks a doge, is a duplicate, or contains a cat – it goes before a jury of three users, who have made a deposit of Kleros' PNK token.  The jury then makes its decision to reject or approve the image. If you are a jury member that votes in dissent with the majority, you forfeit some PNK tokens, which get redistributed to the majority-voting jurors.  If the meme is accepted, the challenger's ether deposit goes to the submitter, minus a fee for the jurors. If it's rejected, the challenger gets the submitter's ether deposit, also minus the fee.  The submitter of the image can appeal the decision, however, by making another ether deposit. Then, the same process as above repeats itself, but with seven jurors. And after that, the submitter can appeal the decision with a jury of 15.  The reason for increasing the number of jurors with each round of appeals, Ast explained, is that bribing a majority of the jurors gets more expensive.  ""It's going to cost you a lot of money to keep on attacking the system and to win,"" Ast said.  One user, Tristan Roberts, tried this route, posting a picture of a cat with an offer to pay jurors 0.3 ether to break the rules. Roberts told CoinDesk that he found it ""practically impossible to keep bribing the jurors, [since] the amount of ETH I would win would be less than the amount needed to bribe them.""  ""All in all, I'm impressed with how the game theory dynamics worked out; I wasn't able to break it,"" said Roberts.  Although, at least one user does appear to have sneaked a cat onto the list. According to the Doges on Trial rules, they're entitled to receive two ether and a CryptoKitty for beating the system. The ultimate decision as to whether the picture below contains an illicit cat will be left up to Coopérative Kleros, the legal entity behind the platform's development.  If Kleros proves its mettle with Doges on Trial, Ast said, the platform could serve as an arbitration layer for swathes of the blockchain ecosystem.  A number of cryptocurrency projects in different niches, such as e-commerce and gaming, are building out their own dispute resolution mechanisms, he explained, adding:  ""Our vision is to tell all of these guys, just focus on your platform, on your product, and just delegate arbitration to Kleros.""  And already, some are interested.  In March, the Kleros team said it would integrate the platform with Ink Protocol, a cryptocurrency payment and reputation system built on ethereum. Ink's native token XNK has replaced the credit system on Listia, an e-commerce site with 10 million registered users, in which individuals trade goods among themselves using credits rather than buying them from vendors.  The same month, Kleros announced a partnership with Dether, which allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies locally for cash.  For certain use cases, though, Kleros faces competition. Civil, for example, has developed a similar crypto economic system targeted specifically at identifying and weeding out fake news.  And the decentralized prediction market Augur shares Kleros' goal of ""keeping people honest on the blockchain through game theory,"" according to Kleros crypto economics researcher William George, in a recent blog post.  Still, Ast remains optimistic that tons of use cases exist for the platform.

Called SFOX, the platform announced on Thursday that its new equity financing was led by Tribe Capital and Social Capital, and has backing from Airbnb co-founder Nathan Blecharczyk, Y Combinator, Danhua Venture Capital, Digital Currency Group and more.    Founded in 2014, SFOX operates as a trading hub for institutional investors, high-net-worth individuals and family offices. The firm helps these high volume traders fulfill their buy and sell orders by executing them through its integrations with different cryptocurrency exchanges.      SFOX aims to minimize the impact of high volume trading on the cryptocurrency market, while boosting trading liquidity – ""one of the most significant barriers to institutional cryptocurrency adoption,"" according to Arjun Sethi, co-founder and partner at Tribe Capital.      SFOX claims in the announcement that it has facilitated over $9 billion in transaction volume so far, and reports a 12-fold growth in client numbers already this year.      With the new funding, SFOX said it is working on rolling out crypto-asset management services, in addition to the existing trading facility. It also plans to increase manpower and expand to more geographic regions in the coming 12 months.      SFOX's chief executive Akbar Thobhani – who was previously head of growth and business development at Airbnb – said the plan is a response to increasing interest from clients in a greater level of exposure to cryptocurrency assets.      Thobhani commented:      ""We continue to observe sustained and increasing demand from institutions that want to include cryptocurrencies as part of a diverse portfolio but are reluctant to do so because of uncertainty and volatility.""

42429556,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzWNh,1534417206,$6.6K: Bitcoin Price Eyes New Target for Bull Reversal,"Bitcoin is showing signs of life, but only a break above key resistance at $6,675 would confirm a bullish reversal, technical charts indicate.  At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,470 on Bitfinex – up 10 percent from the 6.5-week low of $5,859 hit on Aug. 14.  However, the break below the key support of $6,000 (February low) was short-lived and prices moved back above $6,100 by UTC close, signaling bearish exhaustion.  More importantly, the follow-through has been positive: BTC crossed Tuesday's high of $6,259 and jumped to $6,649 yesterday, confirming that sellers have likely run dry and bargain hunters are finding the current price too attractive to pass up.  Hence, it seems safe to say that a bullish trend reversal is in progress and would be confirmed if prices take out the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance of $6,675, as seen in the chart below.  Hourly chart        BTC is creating the right shoulder of a inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern on the hourly chart.  A move above $6,675 would confirm the sell-off from the July high of $8,507 has ended and would open the doors to $7,490 (target as per the measured height method).  That said, the daily and the 4-hour charts show that BTC could attempt a break above $6,675 in the next 24 hours.  4-hour chart  As seen in the chart above, the cryptocurrency has pierced the descending trendline, meaning the sell-off from the high of $8,507 has ended. The relative strength index (RSI) has also adopted a bullish bias (above 50.00).  Daily chart  BTC created a bullish inverted hammer candle yesterday, adding credence to Tuesday's long-tailed (bear exhaustion) candle and confirming the cryptocurrency has likely bottomed out at $5,859.  View  BTC bulls are slowly gaining ground and could attack the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance of $6,675 in the next 24 hours.  A break above $6,675, if accompanied by a pick-up in volumes, would confirm a bearish-to-bullish trend change and allow a rally to $7,490. On the way higher, BTC could encounter resistance at $6,924 (50-day moving average), $6,982 (rising trendline hurdle as seen on the daily chart), and $7,162 (100-day moving average).  Acceptance below $6,180 (previous day's low) would pour cold water over optimism generated by the inverted hammer candle and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000.

42429547,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzW9h,1534406421,"There's a Huge Opportunity for Everyone in Crypto, It's Called KYC/AML","Bruce Silcoff is the CEO of Shyft in Toronto, which is focused on developing blockchain-based solutions for digital identity and KYC/AML processes.      It's easy to question the need for strict know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) controls, as Edan Yago did in a recent CoinDesk op-ed.  Who likes the rising complexity and costs of compliance? Who gets excited about relinquishing control of personal data to set up a wallet, let alone access basic financial services?  The resulting data duplication across multiple centralized, siloed databases raises the risk profile for organizations large and small, stifling basic operations and thrilling and delighting no one.  KYC/AML is an easy target for critics like Yago, who also argue that these practices effectively amount to global surveillance, and therefore stand in direct contradiction to two of the most important aspects of cryptocurrency – privacy and disintermediation. Not only can KYC/AML infringe on a user's right to privacy, we are told, but it can see sweeping ""Big Brother"" surveillance practices instituted. Over and out.  Should we do away with regulation then? Down with KYC/AML? Not so fast.  We've seen the alternative to no regulation firsthand, and what that means for blockchain companies. Silk Road aftershocks slowed down innovation and effectively de-legitimized the space for years, because blockchain came to be associated with criminal activity. Regulatory uncertainty meant that for years, early adopters took enormous personal and financial risks to pave the roads we get to travel on today.  Even more importantly, if none of us show up to sit at the table when it matters most – when the future of the ecosystem is at stake, because, no doubt, more regulations are coming – we will have only ourselves to blame if we don't like the results.  A new privacy standard  It's important to note that although KYC/AML processes and regulations can hinder privacy, that doesn't mean that they must.  There is no reason that approaches more consistent with the fundamental principles of cryptocurrencies can't be devised to satisfy KYC requirements without placing too much data in the hands of a central provider (or a handful of providers) who could abuse it, or open it up to abuse through a catastrophic breach.  In fact, KYC practices are fast becoming the gold standard for regulatory bodies looking to thwart money laundering in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.  It's incumbent upon the cryptocurrency ecosystem to develop solutions that carry out these practices in a manner that doesn't kill the technology's promise.  Mass adoption  If our common goal is to advance mass adoption, blockchain and crypto companies should be prepared to work closely with the regulators and come up with new ways to solve big thorny problems. Simply put, we must build better technology.  Blockchain and strong cryptography enable multi-stakeholder use cases that simply weren't technologically possible even a few years ago, and KYC/AML presents new exciting opportunities to revisit and uphold the original intent to curb bad actors and improve the protocol.  At present, the KYC/AML infrastructure mirrors guidelines implemented by centralized financial enterprises around the world. Just as traditional financial institutions require due diligence on prospective customers, cryptocurrency companies also rely on KYC/AML to collect personally identifiable information on individuals before allowing them to create new crypto wallets, do peer-to-peer lending, remit money across borders, or buy or sell crypto on an exchange. In the event a crime is committed, this information can be used to accurately pinpoint an offender and take appropriate action where necessary.  However, identity verification shouldn't come with the risk of data compromise and extreme costs.  Through strong cryptography and through introducing decentralization into the current system and process, it's possible to create protocol-level crypto rails to dramatically improve the handling of KYC/AML from the privacy and security perspective — all while reducing the cost of verification and clearing the barriers to mass adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain.  Financial inclusion  Once the costs are dramatically reduced, the upside of having strong and efficient KYC/AML regulations in place means more businesses will innovate and prosper. Progressive jurisdictions like Bermuda, Mauritius and Australia are already taking note and turning to the blockchain and crypto space for collaboration on legislation.  This levels the playing field for those billions of people without ""legal ID"" in a traditional sense, because new methods emerge to help assess people's ability to repay loans, prove their credibility, transact and participate in the global economy. Traditional banking becomes a viable option then, as do the alternatives because there are new ways to transact and establish trust that don't involve relinquishing full control of personal data. Finally, if the costs of KYC/AML compliance keep that global economic participation at bay, once that barrier is gone, imagine the freedom for innovators it would create.  This is why my team and other notable organizations are working to showcase the importance of KYC/AML and other important initiatives in the global cryptocurrency community — to prove, through tangible use cases, that it's not preventing crypto innovation, it's pioneering it.

42429543,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzVzh,1534392145,What the Foreshadow Flaw Means for the Future of Cryptocurrency,"UPDATE (16th August 19:11 BST): Updated to include an emailed statement from cryptocurrency startup Enigma.      Yet another dire security flaw was unveiled Tuesday with potential ripple effects across the tech world, including for cryptocurrency projects seeking to leverage certain hardware devices.  Following a pair of bugs unveiled earlier this year, the Foreshadow vulnerability impacts all Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) enclaves, a special, supposedly extra-secure region of chip often used for storing sensitive data.  In short, while the enclave is supposed to be tamper-proof, a group of researchers found a way for an attacker to steal the information it stores.  For many, Meltdown and Spectre were spooky enough. The bugs impacted every single Intel chip, the hardware powering most of the world's computers. But, since it wasn't so easy to execute, there weren't many real-world attacks.  Foreshadow might not sound as bad because it impacts a more specific type of Intel hardware: SGX. However, since many cryptocurrency projects plan to use this technology, Foreshadow could have even worse ramifications for the cryptocurrency world.  Perhaps most notably, Signal creator Moxie Marlinspike is in the process of advising a new, allegedly greener coin called MobileCoin that puts SGX at the center, even raising $30 million to do so.  As a result, these projects will have to do some restructuring before launching for real.  ""The findings released today absolutely have a broad impact on cryptocurrency projects,"" Cornell University security researcher Phil Daian told CoinDesk.  The good news, though, is that the researchers followed the security world's ""responsible disclosure process"" for revealing bugs, alerting Intel before showing it off so the tech giant could come up with a fix (which deployed a few months ago).  But the security world is making a lot of noise because that still might not be enough.  ""It is likely that, because many of these systems are slow to upgrade and because many of these fixes require either involved or hardware upgrades, infrastructure will remain vulnerable to this class of attack for a long time,"" Daian said, adding:  ""It would be surprising if at some point this flavor of attack is not used to steal cryptocurrency.""  The good and the bad  But there's both good and bad news.  For one, it appears as though none of the high-profile SGX projects in cryptocurrency are yet being used to secure real money. ""To my knowledge, there is no SGX system in production or widespread use in the space today,"" Daian said.  The bad news is there are a plenty of projects that want to use SGX, and maybe even have plans to do so soon. And the ideas are pretty cool.  MobileCoin  is perhaps the most ambitious since the project's developers want to replace miners, a crucial part of securing any cryptocurrency, with these enclaves to build a more energy-efficient cryptocurrency.  But there are plenty of others that want to use SGX for its security and privacy gains.  Enigma is using it in a unique bid to boost privacy in smart contracts, while wallet hardware company Ledger went as far as to partner with the tech giant Intel to explore using SGX as a new avenue for storing private keys. And the list goes on and on.  Enigma argued, however, that the impact of the bug has been overblown.  ""Like any software or hardware, the discovery and resolution of potential vulnerabilities is a normal and expected part of the development process. In this case, the vulnerability has already been addressed by Intel and does not in any way diminish the potential for SGX technology,"" Enigma CEO and co-founder Guy Zyskind said in a statement.  Zyskind added that Enigma's ""proud"" to be working with Intel and believe their work with SGX is crucial to cryptocurrency's future, as they're creating ""robust privacy solutions that will finally allow decentralized applications to work and be adopted at scale.""  These huge benefits are still not stopping some researchers from worrying about its impact, though.  ""The SGX attack is devastating,"" Kings College London assistant professor Patrick McCorry told CoinDesk, adding that research groups have long been discussing how it can be deployed to add extra security to data.  ""It can potentially undermine the integrity – and privacy – for any application that is reliant upon trusted hardware. A lot of companies in the cryptocurrency space rely on SGX to support multi-party protocols, but this attack allows any participant to cheat,"" he added.  ""In my opinion, good SGX research and systems should assume hardware can always be broken at some cost, and should, as always, design defensively and include layered security,"" Daian said.  He went on to give some advice to companies that plan to launch soon.  ""Projects planning to launch soon that rely on SGX should evaluate the vulnerabilities and any updates from Intel with caution for implications to the security of their systems, and should publish such investigations along with their code,"" he said.  The other bad news, though, is it's possible for hackers to find a new variant of the bug, similarly impacting all SGX chips.  ""But as Foreshadow demonstrates, attacks only get better,"" McCorry remarked.  Sweet vindication  Meanwhile, the bug is leaving some developers feeling vindicated.  Because Intel has a backdoor into all SGX devices, it's long been a controversial tech avenue for cryptocurrency projects, with enthusiasts often arguing that using the technology puts too much power or trust in one company's hands.  Simply put, in their minds, the Foreshadow vulnerability is a good example of why not to put SGX at the cornerstone of a cryptocurrency project.  ""Good thing we didn't adopt a certain professor's SGX-based bitcoin scaling solution!"" tweeted pseudonymous bitcoin enthusiast Grubles.  ""Though even *if* it had been somehow perfect, it was never a good idea to root the security of bitcoin in a chip vendor's secret sauce technology,"" Bitcoin Core maintainer Wladimir van der Laan responded.  But again, most projects using SGX haven't actually launched in production.  Some researchers went as far as to argue most cryptocurrency projects exploring SGX haven't actually used them on real money because Intel has such a bad reputation. The industry has been experimenting with the technology - but is too cautious to actually launch go through with it.  Some security researchers advise to continue on this trend – to not use SGX.  But other researchers are more optimistic that SGX, or something like it, could one day play a big role in cryptocurrency, seeing Foreshadow as a positive sign trusted hardware is being battle-tested.  ""SGX will need to be repeatedly tested and broken by adversarial researchers until it can claim a strong degree of security, which will take years,"" Daian said, going on to add that he believes trusted hardware along the lines of SGX may one day play a big (and positive) role in cryptocurrency.  In short, it might just take some time, he argued, adding:  ""Realizing such a technology certainly holds great promise for trust minimization and scalable privacy protection in cryptocurrency and beyond.""
