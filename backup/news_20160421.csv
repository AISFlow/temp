42426819,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwnfh,1461282463,Morgan Stanley Report Issues Predictions for Blockchain in 2025,"A new Morgan Stanley report aimed at assessing whether blockchain is a threat to big banks agues that the short-term benefits of the technology are likely minimal, but that future growth is likely.  Published yesterday, the report features a timeline of when Morgan Stanley predicts certain blockchain milestones will be reached. Culminating in 2025, Morgan Stanley identifies 10 roadblocks to banks integrating blockchain.  However, the report includes language that suggests the global investment bank may be seeking to understand how blockchain tech may impact its portfolio or perhaps its own earnings.  The report reads:  ""While the long-term opportunity is clear, the blue sky is still too far to the right to affect 2017/18 EPS [earnings per share], we think, so our stock positioning generally reflects medium-term earnings issues for our banks.""  Key milestones  That aside, the report is perhaps most focused on developing a timeline for how Morgan Stanley expects blockchain tech to progress over the next decade.  For instance, the report pegs the banking industry’s current proof-of-concept phase as completing in 2018. It further lists key milestones the industry could use to determine the success of such projects within this time frame.  According to the report, institutions must successfully scale the technology, enable the transacting of assets and assess if the tech offers benefits that go beyond traditional legacy systems.  The next phase of blockchain adoption by financial institutions overlaps slightly with the current phase, running from 2017 to 2020, according to the Morgan Stanley report.  During the ""Shared Infrastructure Emerges"" phase, Morgan Stanely predicts that proven technologies will be adopted ""well beyond"" proof-of-concept. An interface for external users will be developed including APIs giving others access to the tools will begin to be leveraged.  The final phase of the report picks up where the previous one left off, in 2021, and continues to 2025. During this ""Assets Proliferate"" phase Morgan Stanley predicts that more assets will move onto a blockchain ""as efficiencies prove out"".  Obstacles to adoption  But standing between this final phase of blockchain adoption are roughly 10 obstacles, according to the report.  These include the need to:  Align incentives  Choose standards  Determine which stakeholders pay for the upgrade  Ensure that solutions are simple and interoperable  Establish governance standards  Evaluate the legal risks, cost benefits and security  Respond to regulatory concerns  Successfully scale the technology.  Each category was graded by four criteria and only one — simplicity — was important in all four areas: economics, technology, cooperation and policy.  From the report:  ""Any killer app in software has to deliver simplicity. This goes for blockchain solutions too. Uncomplicated and easy to understand. It needs to interface with other parts of the tech food chain seamlessly, enabling faster setup time, training time and fixing time.  ""It must deliver on the promise of efficiency and be easy enough for all parties to understand and leverage,"" the report continues.  Final words  Morgan Stanley concludes its report with a list of ""tentative conclusions"" and predictions, asserting the best use cases for blockchain in the near future are in post-trade, especially loans, credit default swaps and securities.  ""Further off"" in the future, Morgan Stanley predicted the payments industry stands to be positively impact by blockchain.  ""The bearish case,"" as the report describes it, is a ""dramatic reduction of margins"" and the risk that ""profit pools"" might leak to ""other players.""  For custodians that generate profits from ensuring securities are accurately measured and moved blockchain technology ""threatens their value add"" as shorter settlement periods could cut into their revenues. The report specifically mentions BNY Mellon, State Street, Northern Trust, Citi and JP Morgan Chase.  From the report:  ""That's why the custodians are at the leading edge of distributed ledger work to ensure that they can deliver the most efficient blockchain solutions to their clients.""

42426831,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwnxh,1461270433,Why Regulation is Pushing Bank of Ireland Toward Blockchain,"While recent headlines have trumpeted the work of ever-expanding consortiums of global banking giants, somewhat lost in the conversation are the smaller, regional banks that are increasingly investing resources to conduct blockchain projects.  For example, Bank of Ireland, one of the country’s so-called ‘Big Four’ banks, recently unveiled a trial focused on trade reporting in partnership with professional services firm Deloitte. Involving the bank’s Global Markets division, the trial, which began in January, sought to establish a reporting mechanism, based on blockchain, for the entire trade lifecycle.  At the time, the Bank of Ireland indicated that the test was spurred in part by the regulatory requirements facing banking institutions today.  Stephen Moran, innovation manager for the Bank of Ireland, reinforced this point in a recent interview with CoinDesk.  He remarked:  ""I think it helps some big problems in the bank, including our global markets division. What popped out was a particular use case here, was how incumbent banks move forward on the regulatory agenda. And this is really driving what’s required in terms of innovation.""  Moran went on to explain that in an environment in which banks face rising regulatory requirements – and the costs that come along with it – blockchain technology provides a possible avenue for addressing those concerns.  ""Once you have an overarching layer that is an immutable, secure and timestamped repository of information, it allows you to achieve that regulatory requirement and transparency,"" he explained, adding:  ""It also gives you the regularity of information to your front office, to your clients.""  Steps toward transformation  According to Moran, Bank of Ireland’s interest in the technology had a dual origin.  First, like a growing number of financials worldwide, the bank saw a sea change away from skepticism about the code underlying bitcoin and toward the idea that it could solve real problems in banking.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The story of blockchain was...you know, like everyone else, you kind of see the fear of missing out. It’s not that were were hugely skeptical about stepping in at the intake. It’s more [about] context from different problems that surfaced in the organization that came back around to blockchain.""  Moran drew a wider context, suggesting that the bank sees blockchain as part of a trend toward a more digitized banking system, not just in terms of what consumers experience, but also in the back-office side of things.  Further, he framed the bank’s interest in blockchain applications alongside a desire to test and potentially deploy other financial technologies.  ""Like a lot of banks, we have a legacy system, and we’re going through the process of transformation but that takes time,"" he said.  That process, Moran went on to explain, mirrors actions at other banks around the world – a bottom-up evolution wherein different business divisions within a particular institution put forward ideas and resources toward possible applications.  He remarked:  ""We made the argument, we made the case to embark on this voyage of discovery for blockchain. We said, whichever part of the organization you’re in, put your hand up if you want to get involved. This was, I think, the key sense for us – we have people from our technology division, corporate treasury division, retail division.""  Promising results  In interview, Moran discussed the bank's trade reporting trial, which he said was the result of a desire within the bank’s innovation ranks to move past simply talking about possible uses cases.  Moran said that the test sparked further questions among the bank’s innovation leads, including how to assess which platforms or networks to use. For example, Bank of Ireland used Deloitte’s Rubix blockchain platform as part of the test.  Ultimately, this year’s test will beget more, he said.  ""We need to continue the journey,"" he explained. ""We need to – we don't necessarily have to be a leader, but we need to make informed decisions for ourselves for what path we take before we end up in a position where decisions are made for us. Making decisions for ourselves is key.""  Other use cases on the Bank of Ireland’s radar include remittances and value transfer, something Moran was of particular interest given the bank’s role in Ireland-to-UK money transfers.  He suggested this use case and others would be subject to further testing both internally as well as in partnership with Deloitte and other potential partners.  Looking ahead  During the interview, Moran suggested that Bank of Ireland sees a role for blockchain in the country’s financial system, and said the bank wants to work with the domestic startup community on both exploring use cases as well as developing prototype products.  He pointed to recent events like an October blockchain hackathon hosted in Dublin as an opportunity to speak with and learn from startups working with the technology, a process that he said is still ongoing today.  ""Now we have the chance to go and engage in a meaningful way with those startups,"" he said.  Like other financial institutions, Moran said the Bank of Ireland is taking its exploration of blockchain slowly but steadily. As for the recent test, Moran indicated that next steps include taking those results to the bank’s leadership and figuring out which use cases to test and which bank departments should become involved next.  Moran concluded:  ""The future is undefined, except to say we’ve got momentum and we’ll see where we go. And that’s our message to the organization and the country as a whole.""

42426833,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwnzh,1461263870,Bitcoin Price Passes $448 to Hit Two-Month High,"The price of bitcoin passed $448 for the first time in two months today on the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) to reach a press-time total of $448.50.  The figure was the highest observed on the CoinDesk USD BPI since 21st February, when the price hit an inter-day high of $448.29.  This notable climb helped bitcoin break the pattern of the last several weeks, when it fluctuated primarily within a tight range.  For the month through 12:00 UTC on 21st April, the digital currency's price closed between $410 and $430 in what had been heralded as its longest period of stability for some time.  Still, bitcoin stayed within this range for a reason, as market observers were watching the digital currency’s community to see whether it would make any progress on the fundamental issues facing its technology.  While some have been disappointed with the bitcoin community’s apparent lack of progress toward a technical fix that would adjust its capacity, developers took a small step forward by releasing the code for the Segregated Witness (SegWit) proposal on 20th April.  The update to the bitcoin protocol would allow blocks to contain more data by removing the part of the transaction that holds the digital signature. However, the community had not yet implemented the update at the time of report.  Charles L.

42426816,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwnXh,1461262294,MIT Responds to Bitcoin Developer Concerns Over 'ChainAnchor',"A blockchain project being developed by MIT researchers gained new attention this week following criticism of its alleged design elements, though the veracity of these claims has been denied by those involved.  The inciting incident came on 21st April, when Bitcoin Core developer and blockchain consultant Peter Todd posted what he positioned as ""leaked copies"" of documents relating to an MIT Connection Science research project called ChainAnchor.  In the post, Todd, an expert on threat analysis who has done work with bitcoin and non-bitcoin companies, denounced the project for what he concluded was its plan to ""bribe"" bitcoin miners by incentivizing these entities not to process transactions in which the participants are not identifiable.  ""We’re talking about miners being coerced to only process transactions that have opted into a regulated scheme,"" Todd told CoinDesk.  The remarks led to criticism of MIT on bitcoin social media channels, and even an attempt to encourage miners to pledge that they would not support this type of scheme.  MIT responded to the criticism today in statements to CoinDesk that denounced the post as lacking substance.  An MIT spokesperson said:  ""First of all, we are glad people are interested in what we are doing. We published this months ago on a public website and keep updating it at www.mit-trust.org. [But] ChainAnchor is simply not relevant to the bitcoin discussion.""  The university provided a link to the ChainAnchor project, as well as an updated white paperhttp://static1.squarespace.com/static/55f6b5e0e4b0974cf2b69410/t/5717e2350442622ecf2d8739/1461183029767/ChainAnchor-Identities-04172016.pdf on the effort, dated 17th April. By contrast, Todd’s slides and images were dated in February, and though similar to MIT’s, some notable changes were made.  For instance, the ChainAnchor paper positions the project as one that’s aimed to ""address the issue of identity and access control within shared permissioned ledgers"".  Further, language in the document suggests that the system, while inspired by bitcoin, is not intended to run on the live bitcoin blockchain.  Todd’s critique  The release of the white paper would seem to call into question an element of Todd’s critique, which was that the system appeared to him, as suggested by the slides he posted, as being for use on the public blockchain, with public mining entities.  ""There isn’t a good technical reason to put regulated transactions on the bitcoin network, when you’re already expecting AML,"" he told CoinDesk. ""The main thing I would say, there just isn’t a technical reason to try to pay miners to not mine bitcoin transactions.""  He went on to state that, even if the system was used for a private network, it is worth considering how such architecture could be dangerous on a public blockchain like bitcoin.  ""It’s worth thinking about threats. I could imagine if you had some big exchanges sign onto this, it could cause serious problems,"" he said, acknowledging the possibility that his statements might be less relevant should the project be intended for a permissioned network.  He added:  ""If this didn’t mention bitcoin, I wouldn’t talk about it at all.”  Overall, Todd’s comments expressed a notable worry that bitcoin's use case as a store of value is falling out of favor with industry startups, something he worries could convince these entities that drastic solutions are needed to encourage users to the network.  Such comments come in the wake of the long-simmering debate over how bitcoin should best be scaled, though this may finally be stemmed with the upcoming release of Segregated Witness, one possible solution.  Relevant for institutions  As for MIT, the university used the situation to reiterate its support for the bitcoin network, but said that ChainAnchor was more relevant to large consortium efforts such as R3, in which permissioned blockchain systems may require new ways to establish trust.  “We also work on other flavors of blockchain, including permissioned blockchains, [and] these are the kinds of blockchains that a number of mainstream companies are beginning to implement,” the university said.  The spokesperson said that such a system could be used as a way to make permissioned blockchains more compliant with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations.  MIT said it would seek to further discuss issues related to the compliance and regulation of blockchain systems with the public in a forthcoming white paper series due this May.  Correction: A previous version of this article indicated that Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo initiated the campaign to encourage miners to boycott the platform. This has been corrected.

42426812,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwnRh,1461253940,Intel Conducting Experiments to Massively Scale Blockchain,"Intel, the largest chip-maker in the world, is looking to trusted execution environments on its hardware chips to enhance security and privacy for blockchain users.  Speaking at the Tomorrow’s Transactions conference in London this week, Kelly Olson, director of the distributed ledger technology group at Intel, discussed ways it is possible to use a ""secure enclave"", similar to what Apple uses for its Touch ID, to increase blockchain security.  Olson's group is conducting research on large-scale deployments of blockchains that could scale to several tens of thousands or millions of nodes, though he said the work is still in early stages.  Still, Olson made the case for using secure hardware solutions that can provide a trusted computation environment. The immediate use case of such a hardware solution would be for key management in blockchains.  Discussing bitcoin specifically, Olson noted that even though the public blockchain network itself has been very secure, users have experienced losses due to lost or stolen private keys.  Olson said:  ""While initial blockchain deployments like bitcoin have proven to be quite secure, they have shifted the burden of security from the network to the endpoints that write to the blockchain.""  Olson discussed the use of such a secured hardware computing environment not just in security, but also privacy.  The goal is to bring privacy to the blockchain without centralization, he said, which could prove a difficult task. One proposed solution is to treat the hardware itself as a trusted third-party that can provide a level of verification that is generally either publicly distributed or privately validated.  “Privacy is one of the most difficult problems to solve, as transaction validation and transparency often go hand in hand,"" he said.  Intel experiments  Olson also offered new insights into the blockchain experiments ongoing in Intel's labs.  For example, he said that his team has been working on using blockchains that can be highly customized, where users could change the consensus mechanism of the blockchain or impose participation restrictions.  However, the main differentiating factor between what Intel is working on and what startups like R3 have shown, he said, is scale.  According to Olson, his tests indicate that traditional distributed consensus mechanisms like RAFT don’t scale well beyond 100 nodes or so. However, Intel is looking at cases where the blockchain might scale to potentially millions of nodes.  In order to scale the blockchain sufficiently, he suggested the use of ‘sharding’, a technique that is also being actively explored by Ethereum, although Intel’s implementation may be different.  The idea is to partition the data in such a way that strict ordering of events is not essential, unless there is a specific use case, and therefore these 'chains' can be separated out and run in parallel.  Future of Blockchain  Finally, Olson touched on the evolution of blockchain and its use cases, which he divided into three broad phases.  The first, he said, is a currency application, like bitcoin; the second lies in the creation of digital assets; and the third centers around identity and reputation.  Notably, it was identity and reputation management that was the use case that Olson believes will provide the most value to the end consumers.  But while he acknowledged the potential of this technology, he warned that the industry needs to be pragmatic. He believes distributed ledger technology is still being worked out today, and is not appropriate for the enterprise as it now stands. He was also skeptical about the use of blockchain technology in financial clearing and settlement anytime soon, given the kinds of regulations that are required in the industry.  When asked by a member of the audience about the first real use case of blockchain technology, Olson said that he believes it will, in fact, not be in the financial industry.  Instead, he believes it is more likely that some sort of digital asset being represented on the blockchain is more likely the case, such as tickets to a game, or online-only tokens such as in-game credits.

42426824,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwnlh,1461244750,"For Blockchain VCs, the Time for Ethereum Investments Has Come","Just a few months after the platform's production launch, the first Ethereum startups are already receiving interest, and in some cases, undisclosed investments, from digital currency-focused VC firms.  Interviews with four of the leading blockchain and digital currency industry investors revealed that many are already performing due diligence on startups utilizing the decentralized application platform. Announced in 2014, Ethereum has gained significant traction of late following a successful hard fork and testing from major financial institutions.  Travis Scher, investment associate at Digital Currency Group (DCG), for instance, said the New York-based firm has so far evaluated 20 to 30 startups working on Ethereum, while Blockchain Capital managing partner Bart Stephens told CoinDesk that the firm has already made two as-yet-undisclosed investments in such startups.  Stephens said that Blockchain Capital, one of the technology's most active early-stage investors, is ""bullish"" on Ethereum due to the positive feedback its technology has received from institutions.  The firm has even appointed a junior associate, Jeremy Gardner, to focus on the area for its portfolio, which already includes bitcoin-based startups such as Coinbase and Xapo.  Stephens told CoinDesk:  ""We love bitcoin, we love the bitcoin blockchain, but we also see a multi-chain future. Some of the enterprise customers are interested in federated and private chains and Ethereum is pretty high on the list.""  When announced, such an investment would mark an early sign of confidence for Ethereum, which only recently launched with a limited set of features. In the months and years ahead, the platform plans a number of complex updates, including a switch from proof-of-work transaction verification to a proof-of-stake approach.  Other bitcoin and blockchain-focused venture firms including DCG, Boost VC and Pantera Capital indicated they are interested in investing in Ethereum startups, but have not yet provided funding to any entrepreneurs.  DCG said it expects to make its first investment in a digital currency company in Q2 or Q3 of 2016, and that ""a few"" Ethereum startups would likely join its portfolio by the year’s end.  By contrast, the first investment in a company working on the bitcoin protocol wasn’t made until April 2012, more than three years after its first block was mined in January 2009. At the time, Draper Associates made a seed investment in the now-defunct bitcoin-focused incubator CoinLab.  Investment challenges  As for why investors aren’t yet placing any public bets, most respondents suggested they felt it was too early to tell how strong Ethereum's developer ecosystem will remain.  Such statements coincide with long-standing statements from industry investors that the health of bitcoin’s developer ecosystem is one of its most attractive attributes.  ""One of the challenges in evaluating Ethereum startups is the community is still fairly small and some of the entrepreneurs are newer to the cryptocurrency ecosystem, making it difficult to navigate,"" Meltem Demirors, director of community at DCG, told CoinDesk.  Demirors went on to describe the early bitcoin ecosystem as perhaps more connected and more technical than the Ethereum ecosystem of today.  Others, like Brayton Williams, co-founder of Silicon Valley-based incubator Boost VC, indicated that there is perhaps a lack of mature entrepreneurs building on the technology.  ""For us we need to first find great people who are out to solve a problem and that are confident Ethereum could be the solution or provide tools for the solution,"" he told CoinDesk. ""We do our best to avoid those who are just very excited about Ethereum technology and then go try to find a problem.""  Paul Veradittakit, venture investor at Pantera Capital, noted that his firm is often pegged as a bitcoin-only investor, but that it has been eager to take a multi-blockchain approach, something he suggested Ethereum now allows. Yet, he said the firm has questions about how the technology will overcome upcoming challenges.  ""You want to make sure that the security is well thought out, that the scalability is thought out and that you identify the use cases,"" Veradittakit said, adding: ""We've been monitoring it.""  Veradittakit said Pantera has no plans as of now to offer an ether fund to complement its bitcoin fund, introduced in 2014.  Bitcoin startup interest  A driver factor behind the interest, respondents said, is that digital currency industry firms are paying attention to, and implementing, Ethereum as part of their market approach.  Stephens noted that a number of Blockchain Capital’s portfolio firms, including Bitfinex, Kraken and BitGo, are now offering Ethereum services, and that GoCoin, a payment processing firm, would soon add support.  ""We’re seeing a lot of companies add Ethereum. Instead of selling chocolate, now they have chocolate and vanilla,"" he said.  Demirors said that some DCG portfolio companies are taking a similar path, building infrastructure for the ecosystem’s service providers.  ""I think many of the early movers we’ll see in this ecosystem are existing bitcoin companies that can leverage their operational capabilities and strategic relationships with banks, regulators and other stakeholders to begin building a robust, global network for exchanging, holding, storing and managing ether,"" she said.  Notably, such a logic has been historically used by the financial industry to suggest why it might be more able to help blockchain-based technologies reach the mass market.  Growth potential  As for the growth potential for Ethereum startups, respondents were mixed on projections.  DCG’s Scher said that a cornerstone of its investment thesis is that bitcoin is both a secure store of value and a financial rail, and that Ethereum is unlikely to compete against the bitcoin in these areas.  However, Scher sees Ethereum potentially competing against bitcoin in serving as a platform for smart contracts, identity management and provenance, other potentially large and impactful areas for the technology.  ""Startups building these types of products and services may opt to use Ethereum in the future because of its ease of use and other features that it possesses, and that’s a terrific development for us and the blockchain ecosystem,"" he said.  Demirors said she believes the Ethereum community could one day surpass bitcoin in terms of the number of developers it attracts due to an easier scripting language, but said that it’s not out of the question innovators won’t find solutions to these issues.  Overall, Stephens noted that he sees interest in Ethereum as positive, but that VC firms are just now beginning to analyze the industry for potential investments.  ""It's still early. We’ve met with over a dozen companies, and only a few of them in our opinion are investable,"" Stephens said, concluding:  ""I think that will change.""
