One of which is the price enforcement feature. This will set a minimum gas price for transactions, making the network more efficient and “ensures that the cost of using the network is adequately accounted for.” The most notable of all the changes is the implementation of interchain accounts on the platform. Through the Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol, accounts on Celestia can now be accessed and controlled on other IBC-enabled chains, giving users from both ecosystems flexibility and convenience in accessing their accounts. The upgrade will pass the Arabica devnet first, before its release on the Mocha testnet later this month with the Beta version released in mid-September. As of writing, no concrete launch date for Lemongrass 1.0 has been announced. Choppy Trading Days To Come For Celestia? The token’s current movement is not something to be desired. TIA is occupying the $4.8-$5.8 price range which leaves no room for both the bulls and the bears for significant upward gain. Although the market is bullish, its cooling phase that started today maybe a hint for either the coming pain or gain. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Eyes Upside Break: Is a Bullish Move Ahead?

Posting $70.4 million in negative net income in the quarter is entirely due to FASB accounting rules. Revenue growth aside, there are concerns. Including 82% of HUT's BTC stack being pledged as collateral, liabilities growing faster than assets, and doubts about the ability to monetize AI. I've been covering Hut 8 Corp. ( HUT ) on Seeking Alpha for nearly two years. My last article was nearly 10 months ago back in late October 2023. Until that last article, I'd long called Hut a ""hold"" and viewed the company largely as a Bitcoin treasury play given Hut's massive BTC treasury to market capitalization relative to peers. I left readers with this thought last October: Like other crypto mining entities in the public markets, Hut 8 is trying to get traction in HPC services. To this point, I'd argue that revenue growth story has been bordering on non-existent. However, as we approach the Bitcoin halving, I am of the opinion that we are now at the point where taking some speculative shots on public miners makes sense. But until the merger is completed, Hut's story is less clear than some of its peers. A lot has happened in the time since I wrote that article; some of which has been specific to the company and some that has been industry-wide. Hut's merger with US Bitcoin has been completed. Former CEO Jamie Leverton left the company. The company closed a $150 million investment from Coatue to expand HPC services for AI businesses. The Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) halving occurred in mid-April. Spot BTC ETFs were approved in the US market. I won't unpack all of these developments individually as I've covered some of them in previous Seeking Alpha articles. I'll sum them up briefly in this way; this halving cycle will continue to expose financially weak miners and Hut 8 has been in that camp. In my view, this is why the company has completed a merger, a new CEO, and closed a 9-figure investment for a different line of business. In this update, we'll look at the company's freshly released Q2-24 earnings, July Production, and the balance sheet. Q2 Earnings It's important to remember that the year-over-year comps on these revenue figures are post-merger with US Bitcoin. What stands out to me is the decline in mining as a percentage of total revenue: Q2-24, 10-Q (Hut 8) During the second quarter of 2023, crypto mining made up about 77% of the company's total revenue. As of the latest quarter, that figure is down to just 39%. Managed services generated $9 million for the company, this was roughly double what the segment did in the prior year period. HPC and ""other"" combined for over $12 million. Year-over-year revenue growth of 72% was in line with growth in total cost of revenue. Q2-24, 10-Q (Hut 8) The net loss and opex figures are a bit deceiving here. This year, we are seeing the impact of FASB's fair value accounting. These new accounting standards allow Bitcoin mining companies to include unrealized gains and losses on the digital assets that they hold in quarterly income statements. Not only will Hut 8's quarterly net income from operations swing wildly from quarter to quarter because of this, but since Hut 8 has such a large stack of BTC relative to the company's market cap, those swings in quarterly net income may be quite large by comparison. In the company's earnings presser, this FASB impact was described in this way: The price of Bitcoin on March 31, 2024 was $71,289 compared to the price of Bitcoin on June 30, 2024 of $62,668, such that the decrease in Bitcoin price during the quarter resulted in losses on digital assets of $71.8 million. Shifting to the balance sheet, we can see the big Coatue cash infusion reflected by the company's 475% year-to-date change in cash. Asset growth has been strong due to that cash supply. But I do see a couple of things that stand out: USD in thousands 6/30/24 12/31/23 Change Cash 175,476 30,504 475.3% Total current assets 195,657 61,620 217.5% Digital assets 313,724 282,997 10.9% Digital assets pledged as collateral 255,687 100,550 154.3% Total non-current assets 891,320 679,220 31.2% Total assets 1,086,977 740,840 46.7% Total current liabilities 116,788 112,558 3.8% Total liabilities 418,655 253,201 65.3% Source: Hut 8, 10-Q First, total liabilities are growing faster than total assets. This can certainly change very quickly if Bitcoin's price moves back up to a new all-time high between now and when Q3-24 ends. However, the significant red flag in this table from where I sit is the large move higher in digital assets pledged as collateral. At the end of last year, a little over a third of the company's BTC had been pledged. We now see that figure is over 80%. If the market or the business turns against Hut, we could see that stack drawdown. This would be disappointing for bulls as I see that treasury being one of the only real reasons to hold HUT shares at this point in time. July Production and Treasury Update July 2024 Mining Sector Production (Compass Mining) Hut's July production figures show a company that badly needs another revenue stream. With just 5.5 exahash per second committed to self-mining, Hut's 105 BTC mined during the month puts it on the lower end of the publicly traded miners last month. Hut mined less BTC than HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. ( HIVE ) despite having a market cap three times the size of HUT and similar Q2 revenue figures. Monthly BTC Production (Hut 8, Author's Chart) More importantly though, Hut's long-term production trend is troubled as it now takes double the hash to mine the same level of coins that the company was mining a year ago. This is by no means unique to just HUT but still an issue nonetheless. We've seen this general business model weakness manifest in the company's inability to scale its BTC treasury stack for the last 20 months: Monthly BTC Stack (Hut 8, Author's Chart) As a percentage of the company's total market cap, shares are 52% backed by Hut's BTC stack. This would theoretically make HUT a fairly decent raw BTC proxy if the company turned off machines, liquidated hardware, and just rode Bitcoin higher without spending on operations. But that is not something that is likely, to put it mildly. Risks Data by YCharts Hut 8's Bitcoin mining business is deeply flawed. The fixed supply of Bitcoin's native currency means that the global hash rate being equal, production declines must be offset by a doubling in Bitcoin's price every four years for the numbers to make sense. Of course, the hash rate has historically gone up rather than stayed constant and the economics of mining get considerably worse with more compute competition. Perhaps equally concerning is the pivot to AI as a business model may not bear much fruit either. From a Futurism article in late July: An increasing number of Silicon Valley investors and Wall Street analysts are starting to ring the alarm bells over the countless billions of dollars being invested in AI, an overconfidence they warn could result in a massive bubble. This is a sentiment that was shared by LRT Capital Management in this really strong report earlier this month. It turns out, so far, it's been easier to buy GPUs than to monetize them for HPC services. And we've probably known this already for Hut 8 specifically. HPC has been a desired growth area for the company for at least the last two years since I've been covering the stock and yet at just $3.3 million HPC revenue was lower last quarter than it was in Q2-22 . Investor Takeaways I'm downgrading HUT shares back to ""hold"" from ""buy."" I think the stock may very well benefit from any significant rally in BTC since so much of Hut's market capitalization comes from its treasury stack. But on the merits of the business itself, this is a company that is going through changes and is very much swimming upstream in my opinion. During the conference call, CEO Asher Genoot mentioned more than once that Hut 8 is not a Bitcoin mining or an AI company, rather it's an 'energy company.' Time will tell on that. Energy company aside, in my view, Hut 8 needs either Bitcoin to rally to significantly higher highs from current levels, or it needs revenue from generative AI services to justify all the spend on infrastructure.

32377868,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635131,1723584620,Bitcoin Whales Participate In $588 Million Selloff: Is There More To Come?,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin whale entities have sold approximately $588 million in the cryptocurrency during the past week. Bitcoin Whales Have Made Large Selling Moves Recently As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, the BTC whales have sold around 10,000 BTC over the last seven days. The indicator of relevance here is the “Supply Distribution” from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, which tells us about the total amount of Bitcoin that a given wallet group currently holds. Related Reading: Only 66% Of Ethereum Holders In Profit Despite 21% Price Jump The addresses or investors are divided into these cohorts based on the number of tokens that they are carrying in their balance right now. A holder with 5 BTC, for instance, is put inside the 1 to 10 coins group. In the context of the current topic, the whale cohort is of interest, which typically includes the addresses holding between 1,000 and 10,000 coins. At the current exchange rate, this range converts to $58.8 million at the lower end and $588 million at the upper one. Clearly, the investors belonging to the group would be among the largest in the market, so the cohort can be considered to have some influence. As such, the behavior of the whales can be worth keeping an eye on. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution for this Bitcoin group over the past few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin supply held by the whales has observed a significant decline recently. More specifically, the investors belonging to the cohort have removed a combined 10,000 BTC from their wallets during this selloff, worth about $588 million right now. From the chart, it’s visible that the sharpest selling came during the crash that BTC saw earlier, but these whales have also offloaded significant amounts in the recovery rally that has occurred over the last few days. So far, the Supply Distribution of the cohort has shown no signs of a reversal, so it’s possible that the whales are still in net selling mode. Naturally, this could slow down the asset’s recovery efforts. Nothing is set in stone, though, so the indicator could be used to monitor the coming days to see which direction these humongous investors really take. A net accumulation spree would suggest a renewal of confidence among the large hands and could pave the way for a further rise in the Bitcoin price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Again Show Extreme Fear As BTC Slips To $59,000 In some other news, BTC has been forming a symmetrical triangle pattern recently and is closing in on its apex, as the analyst has explained in another X post. “Bitcoin is showing a symmetrical triangle on the lower time frames,” notes Martinez. “A sustained close outside the $59,000 – $59,530 range could trigger a 4.80% move for BTC.” BTC Price Bitcoin has struggled to put together bullish momentum in the last couple of days as its price has slumped to $58,800.

42390624,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd4LXr,1723580586,Performing Against an Ether Staking Rate,"By Tom Whitton, CFO, Pier Two. Authors' views and opinions are their own and not associated with CoinDesk Indices. Conducted by CoinDesk Indices and not associated with CoinDesk editorial.  Understanding CESR  One such metric gaining prominence is the CESR (composite ether staking rate) benchmark, created by CoinDesk Indices and CoinFund. CESR measures the average staking rate across the Ethereum network, providing a reliable standard for operators and stakers to gauge performance. By comparing staking rates to CESR, operators like Pier Two can objectively assess their competitiveness and effectiveness.  Why Benchmarks are Important  Benchmarks are important in financial markets to create structure, standardisation and comparability for many financial products, like ETFs. CESR is a useful rate for issuers that are looking to offer ETH Staking funds, and for validators that are looking to engage in performance monitoring, or swaps to lock in rates and build more sustainable and less volatile business models.  How Operators Can Use the CESR Benchmark  1. Performance Benchmarking CESR offers operators a reliable metric to benchmark their validator performance against the broader network. By comparing their returns to a trusted industry benchmark, operators can identify areas for improvement and optimise their operations, as well as to differentiate their staking products in a competitive market.  For example, as you can see in the below chart, Pier Two’s APR has consistently outperformed the CESR benchmark, with our 7-day APR of 3.79% and our 30-day APR of 3.58%, compared to CESR's 7-day APR of 3.35% and 30-day APR of 3.38%, meaning higher returns for our customers' staked assets than the industry average.  The CESR benchmark fosters healthy competition among operators. Those who outperform are rewarded with increased delegations, while those who don’t are incentivised to enhance their performance to remain competitive.  2. Market Monitoring and Strategic Insights  CESR enables operators to gain deeper insights into the Ethereum ecosystem. By monitoring trends, operators can make informed strategic decisions and adapt to market conditions and network changes (e.g., Shapella and Dencun upgrades).  The CESR benchmark demonstrates that well-managed operators can achieve consistent returns despite market and network fluctuations. This underscores the value of robust operational practices and vigilant monitoring.  3. Enhancing Infrastructure Performance with Rated RAVER  Reliable and performant infrastructure is key to yield success. Operators must leverage high uptime, low latency, and rigorous operational protocols to maximise staking efficiency and rewards. Using Rated’s Validator Effectiveness Rating (RAVER) helps measure these factors, considering uptime, participation in consensus, and overall reliability.  A key factor in our yield success is our robust infrastructure, which ensures minimal downtime and optimal node performance. We leverage high uptime, low latency, and rigorous operational protocols to maximize staking efficiency and rewards for our customers.  As shown in the chart below, Pier Two's 7-day RAVER stood at 98.30%, compared to the top 15 node operators by market share average of 97.46%, and our 30-day RAVER maintained a 98.00%, surpassing the top 15 node operators by market share, with an average of 97.21%.  By using CESR as the industry signal and Rated's RAVER metrics to measure infrastructure performance, operators like Pier Two, can optimise to maintain a competitive edge. This comprehensive approach allows operators to fine-tune strategies and operations continuously, to further enhance services.  Practical Example: Maximising Returns  Consider an example customer with 100,000 ETH staking for one year using the 7-day APYs of Pier Two and CESR:  This difference of 457 ETH illustrates the potential additional rewards for customers who use high-performing operators (i.e. those who outperform metrics on CESR and RAVER).  Final Thoughts  The CESR benchmark offers a vital tool for operators to measure and enhance their performance within the Ethereum ecosystem. By leveraging CESR alongside operational metrics like Rated’s RAVER, operators can achieve greater transparency, trust, and efficiency. As the Ethereum network continues to evolve, these benchmarks will play an increasingly vital role in guiding and evaluating validator success. CESR will continue to be used by market participants, validators and financial institutions worldwide when engaging in products that reference Ethereum as the first bedrock financial rate of return for the Internet.  Institutional staking service operators, like Pier Two, are dedicated to providing security and stability to the Ethereum ecosystem while delivering premier staking yields to customers. To uphold this commitment, we recognise the importance of robust performance metrics.

Utilizing classical charting principles, Brandt analyzes the technical pattern formation, highlighting its potential impact on Bitcoin’s price trajectory. What Bitcoin’s Inverted Triangle Pattern Means On August 12, Brandt took to X (formerly Twitter) to shed light on a recent pattern formation in Bitcoin’s price chart. Sharing a price chart illustrating Bitcoin’s price movements from May 2023 to November 2024, the analyst identified a unique inverted or expanding Triangle pattern in Bitcoin. Related Reading: Celsius Takes Legal Action Against Tether In $2.4 Bitcoin Collateral Controversy Usually, triangle-like shape patterns on the Bitcoin chart can indicate either a continuation or a reversal for Bitcoin’s price movements. The pattern depicted in Brandt’s post features two descending trend lines that are diverging from one another. Brandt explains that while this pattern could be misconstrued as a bullish signal, the absence of a breakout means he would not be making any trades at this time. He emphasized that he does not make trades based on opinions but on established chart patterns. The crypto analyst further mentioned that he avoids trading when a price is range-bound without a clear trend and only enters trades when a pattern is completed. After Brandt described Bitcoin’s chart pattern as an inverted or expanding triangle, a crypto member proposed that it could be better described as a “descending broadening wedge.” Brandt responded by explaining that despite the variety of names for patterns, he prefers to use the terminology established by Schabacker, Magee, and Edwards, who are regarded as the founders of classical charting. Concurring with Brandt’s view that “no breakout yet, so no trade,” a crypto community member noted that Bitcoin has been in a hold position for over a year, suggesting that it may not be the right time to trade. Brandt agreed but emphasized that, as a trader, he prioritizes risk management and prefers not to go against his established trading strategies. A final crypto member suggested that the inverted or expanding triangle pattern in Bitcoin may be a “bullish megaphone or bull flag.” Brandt responded by clarifying that, while some might label the pattern as a bull flag, it does not align with the definitions set by the founders of classical charting. Insights On Brandt’s Classical Charting Principles In a more recent X post, Brandt discussed in detail the effectiveness of using classical chart patterns for trading. He revealed that once classical chart patterns are identified, they are resolved in three distinct ways. Related Reading: Ethereum Return To $4,000: Key Zones And Price Levels To Watch Brandt noted that these patterns often morph into something unexpected 50% of the time, failing to follow initial predictions. He added that 25% of the time, classical chart patterns breakout in the anticipated direction but then fail to sustain movement, leading to a reversal or loss. Lastly, in the remaining 25% of cases, the patterns break out as predicted and move towards the projected target, fulfilling the anticipated scenario.

42390612,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd4KYJ,1723578659,The Impact of Ether Staking on the Digital Asset Derivatives Market,"Authors' views and opinions are their own and not associated with CoinDesk Indices. Produced by CoinDesk Indices and not associated with CoinDesk editorial.  The digital asset market continues to evolve, introducing innovative instruments and strategies tailored for institutional investors. One of the most notable advancements in this space is CESR™, the composite ether staking rate, a benchmark designed to provide a standardized measure of staking yields for Ethereum validators.  Market Commentary  Recent developments in the Ethereum ecosystem, particularly the growing interest in ETH ETFs, are driving a surge in overall interest in Ethereum. Although ETH ETFs cannot stake directly, their popularity may lead to volatility in ETH staking yield rates. This is uncharted territory where a larger amount of outstanding ETH may remain unstaked due to ETFs, potentially altering the distribution of rewards among validators. While this scenario has begun to be reflected in the ETH staking yield calculations, the sample size is still small given the recent launch.  CESR serves as a reliable reference rate for Ethereum staking yields, offering two main benefits. First, it aids in treasury cash flow management by providing a predictable benchmark for staking returns, enabling institutions to integrate these returns into their financial forecasting and planning. Second, it allows validators like Twinstake to offer fixed-rate yields to clients through pooled validator networks, ensuring more predictable income streams for investors. This dual functionality supports risk management and strategic decision-making for institutional investors.  Recently, Nonco announced a milestone partnership with Twinstake, marking another transaction by a staking provider using CESR. This pioneering trade underscores the growing interest and adoption of CESR-based financial products. Such innovations are essential for institutional investors, providing them with tools to better manage their balance sheets by locking in yields and enhancing cash flow predictability.  CoinFund and CoinDesk Indices, pioneering the development and maintenance of CESR, continue to enhance the infrastructure of digital asset markets. These developments not only support the operational needs of institutional treasuries but also enable more sophisticated risk management and strategic planning.  Building on this momentum, various major Ethereum validators are set to engage in similar CESR-based swaps in the coming weeks, further solidifying CESR's role as a key benchmark in the staking and derivatives market. This trend highlights the growing recognition of CESR's value in financial planning and risk management for institutional investors.  Educational Lead: The Role of CESR  CESR is a crucial benchmark in the digital asset market, akin to the role that traditional reference rates play in conventional finance. Just as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) once served as a reference rate for interest rate swaps, and the daily settlement price of the S&P 500 is used to calculate P&L for stock index derivatives, CESR provides a standardized measure for Ethereum staking yields. This benchmark allows market participants to gauge the performance of their staking activities, develop hedging strategies, and create derivative products with confidence.  CESR represents the mean annualized staking yield of the Ethereum validator population, capturing both consensus rewards and transaction fees. Published by CoinDesk Indices and administered by CoinFund, CESR offers a transparent and reliable standard for the Ethereum staking market.  By providing a consistent and reliable measure of staking yields, CESR serves as a vital tool for institutional investors to manage their risk, enhance financial planning, and support strategic decision-making in the digital assets realm.  How Nonco is Leveraging CESR  Nonco has integrated CESR into its suite of financial products, offering innovative CESR-based OTC swaps. These swaps allow investors to hedge their staking yields by exchanging fixed for variable rate returns. Additionally, Nonco can create bespoke products tailored to customer needs, such as popular fixed-for-variable rate swaps. By using CESR, Nonco ensures that its clients have access to the most accurate and up-to-date staking yield data, providing a predictable income stream and managing risk effectively.  Adoption of CESR  The adoption of CESR is growing across the industry. Various institutional investors and asset managers are recognizing the benefits of a standardized staking yield benchmark. For instance, prominent asset managers are now benchmarking their staking yield performance to CESR, demonstrating its critical role in the market. This widespread adoption underscores the importance of CESR in providing stability and transparency to Ethereum staking yields.

These numbers have been achieved with a mere 89 hotspots in total for both carriers. The reliability of the network showed that it can go head-to-head with major players in the telecoms industry despite essentially being the new kid around the block. With the focus on decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) gaining more interest, Helium’s entrance into the telecom industry gives consumers another affordable carrier to choose from. As both postpaid and prepaid plans go up in price, Helium’s position as a cheap and reliable alternative will help it grow in the coming years. Helium Price To Stabilize At This Level Percentage-wise, HNT has achieved something great, giving investors and traders gains along with the general upward movement of the market. However, it seems that the token will stabilize on a narrow price range.

If the bears get a hold of the momentum, we can expect the token to drop a few percent towards $5.5 before the bulls regain control. But if the opposite were to happen, HNT bulls have the opportunity to regain $8 in the long term, that is if the bullishness continues along with a positive attitude in the general market. However, with major macroeconomic indicators being announced soon, investors and traders should expect more volatility in the weeks before HNT returns to a fair market price.

Shiba Inu (SHIB), a token that once took the market by storm, has created a generation of investors who are now eager to replicate their past success. With the market showing signs of maturing, these Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors are now turning their attention to a new ICO that has been forecasted to deliver astonishing 1000x returns. The Shift from Shiba Inu (SHIB) to MPEPE Shiba Inu (SHIB), the second-largest meme coin, has been experiencing fluctuations in the market. As of today, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.000014 with a market cap of $8.26 billion USD and a 24-hour trading volume of $296.55 million USD. The coin has seen a 4.98% increase in the last 24 hours, which is a positive sign amid recent market turbulence. Factors Influencing Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) Predicted Surge Recent AI predictions have set the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price to rise significantly by August 15, 2024. According to data from Watcher Guru, the price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) is expected to surge by 60% to reach $0.00002191 by mid-August. This prediction is supported by several factors: Increased Token Burns: The burn rate for Shiba Inu (SHIB) has skyrocketed by 3327% in the past 24 hours, with 106,034,329 tokens removed from circulation. This decrease in supply is likely to push the price up as demand remains steady or increases. Market Dynamics: Despite its current rank as the 13th largest cryptocurrency, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been in a tough competition with Avalanche (AVAX) for the 12th spot. The AI predictions suggest that Shiba Inu (SHIB) could reclaim higher positions in the rankings with this anticipated price surge. Bullish Market Sentiment: AI data suggests that Shiba Inu (SHIB) will continue to see a bullish trend, supported by strong community engagement and strategic token burns. This positive sentiment could drive the price higher in the coming months. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Dark Horse of 2024 While Shiba Inu (SHIB) is poised for a significant increase, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is predicted to outshine its competitors with an expected 420% price surge in 2024. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is currently in its presale stage, with a total of $667,870 raised so far and 788,176,961 tokens sold at a price of 0.00107 USDT per token. The strong performance of Mpeppe in its presale phase indicates a high level of investor confidence and interest. Why Mpeppe (MPEPE) Could Outperform Shiba Inu (SHIB) Rapid Investor Interest: The presale success of Mpeppe (MPEPE) shows a growing interest in this new token. The substantial funds raised in a short period suggest that investors are betting heavily on Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) potential to deliver high returns. Strategic Market Positioning: Mpeppe (MPEPE) has positioned itself as a strong contender in the meme coin market, with a focus on delivering high returns and capturing market share from established coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB). AI-Driven Market Predictions: AI models have highlighted Mpeppe (MPEPE) as one of the top-performing tokens for 2024, predicting a 420% increase. This forecast is based on Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) innovative approach to market engagement and its ability to attract significant investments during its presale. Conclusion: The Battle of Meme Coins As AI-driven predictions continue to shape market expectations, both Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) stand out as top contenders for substantial gains in 2024. Shiba Inu (SHIB), with its established community and strategic token burns, is expected to see a 200% increase in value. Meanwhile, Mpeppe (MPEPE), with its strong presale performance and innovative market strategies, is predicted to surge by 420%. Investors watching these two meme coins should consider the potential risks and rewards as they make their investment decisions. While AI predictions offer valuable insights, the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market means that careful consideration and strategic planning are essential for maximizing returns.

This shift comes as investors look for new opportunities in the rapidly evolving meme coin market, where MPEPE is capturing attention with its unique approach and potential for significant returns. Pepe Unchained (PEPU): A Trailblazer in the Meme Coin Market Pepe Unchained (PEPU) has made waves in the cryptocurrency world, particularly due to its strategic use of Layer-2 technology. Unlike its predecessor, $PEPE, which struggled despite the market’s bullish momentum earlier this year, Pepe Unchained (PEPU) has managed to maintain investor interest and secure substantial funding during its presale. The coin has successfully integrated Layer-2 technology to overcome the high gas fees and slow transaction speeds that have plagued other Ethereum-based meme coins. This technological advancement has not only reduced costs and increased transaction speeds but also set PEPU apart as a serious contender in the meme coin space. The Appeal of Mpeppe (MPEPE) for PEPU Investors As Pepe Unchained continues to grow and attract investors, many are also turning their attention to Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new entrant in the meme coin market that is quickly gaining traction. MPEPE, currently in the third stage of its presale, offers a distinct value proposition that appeals to those looking for the next big opportunity in crypto.

32371403,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635300,1723570427,Crypto Experts Weigh In On Why You Should Purchase Pepe Unchained and Mpeppe,"In the rapidly shifting landscape of cryptocurrency, meme coins have become a focal point for investors seeking exponential gains. Among the latest contenders, Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) have emerged as standout projects. With their roots in the iconic Pepe the Frog meme, both tokens have garnered significant attention for their potential to deliver massive returns. But what exactly sets these coins apart, and why are crypto experts suggesting they might be the next big thing? Let’s dive into the details. Pepe Unchained (PEPU): A Revolution in Meme Coins Pepe Unchained (PEPU) is not just another meme coin riding the wave of internet culture; it represents a strategic evolution in the meme coin market. Built on a Layer-2 blockchain, PEPU offers substantial technological advantages over its competitors. The Layer-2 solution enhances transaction speeds and reduces fees, addressing common issues that have hindered other Ethereum-based tokens. Experts highlight that PEPU’s approach is more than just hype. The project is backed by a strong development team committed to long-term sustainability. Unlike other meme coins that rely solely on viral marketing, PEPU integrates innovative features such as “Double Staking,” which offers a 254% annual return. This staking mechanism has already attracted significant attention from the crypto community, signaling strong investor confidence. Moreover, Pepe Unchained (PEPU) is creating a comprehensive ecosystem that includes its own block explorer and seamless bridging to Ethereum. These features are designed to foster a sustainable and valuable platform, setting PEPU apart from fleeting internet trends. As crypto analyst Sarah Thompson puts it, “Pepe Unchained (PEPU) is positioning itself as a serious contender in the meme coin space, with a focus on long-term value rather than just short-term gains.” Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Dark Horse with Massive Potential While Pepe Unchained (PEPU) is making waves with its innovative technology, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly emerging as a dark horse in the meme coin universe. Launched during a highly successful presale, MPEPE has captured the attention of investors for its unique blend of meme culture and cutting-edge crypto technology. The token’s presale performance has been nothing short of impressive, with over 62.95% of tokens sold in its third stage. What makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) particularly intriguing is its smart contract design (address: 0xd328a1C97e9b6b3Afd42eAf535bcB55A85cDcA7B), which ensures transparency and security for all transactions. This focus on security, coupled with the token’s innovative approach, has led many experts to predict that MPEPE could replicate the success of early meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Crypto expert James Ryder notes, “Mpeppe (MPEPE) is in a unique position to capture the next wave of meme coin mania. Its presale success indicates strong investor interest, and the token’s design is robust enough to support substantial growth post-launch. For those looking to diversify their portfolios with high-risk, high-reward assets, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a compelling option.” The Strategic Case for Diversification One of the key strategies recommended by crypto experts is diversification, and both Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer promising opportunities in this regard. Investors who have already seen significant gains from PEPU are now turning their attention to MPEPE as a way to hedge their bets and maximize returns. This diversification strategy is not just about spreading risk; it’s about positioning oneself for potential explosive gains across multiple high-potential projects. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, new opportunities are constantly emerging, and those who can identify and capitalize on these opportunities early are often rewarded handsomely. Conclusion: Why Experts Are Betting on Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) The buzz around Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not without reason. Both tokens offer unique value propositions that set them apart from the broader meme coin market. PEPU’s technological advancements and focus on long-term sustainability make it a serious contender, while Mpeppe (MPEPE)‘s presale success and innovative design suggest it could be the next big thing in the meme coin universe. Crypto experts are increasingly recommending these tokens as part of a diversified investment strategy. With the potential for significant returns, both Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and MPEPE present compelling opportunities for those looking to ride the next wave of meme coin success. As always, while the promise of high returns is alluring, investors should approach these opportunities with careful consideration and a clear understanding of the risks involved. For those ready to dive into the world of meme coins, the smart contract address for Mpeppe (MPEPE) is 0xd328a1C97e9b6b3Afd42eAf535bcB55A85cDcA7B—offering a straightforward entry point into one of the most talked-about tokens of 2024.

This attention to detail has made MPEPE an attractive option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios with high-potential assets.

32371268,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635296,1723570122,Key Reasons Why XRP Will Never Explode Leaving Investors to Diversify With Mpeppe,"As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, Ripple (XRP), once considered a revolutionary asset in the crypto space, seems to have lost its explosive potential. Despite recent legal victories and attempts to rebrand, Ripple (XRP) has struggled to maintain the momentum that many investors hoped for. With the future of XRP uncertain, many investors are starting to diversify their portfolios by exploring new opportunities such as Mpeppe (MPEPE), a meme coin that is quickly gaining traction. The Decline of XRP: Legal Battles and Market Skepticism Ripple (XRP) was initially heralded as a game-changer in the cryptocurrency world, promising to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the blockchain revolution. However, its association with centralized financial institutions and its prolonged legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have cast a long shadow over its potential. The recent court rulings, while favorable to Ripple, have not provided the bullish momentum that many anticipated. Instead, XRP’s price remains stagnant, hovering around $0.56, and showing no signs of the explosive growth that some influencers had predicted. This has left many investors disillusioned, especially those who expected Ripple (XRP) to “go to the moon” after a legal victory. Moreover, there is growing speculation that the entire legal battle was a carefully orchestrated PR move to distance Ripple (XRP) from its controversial image. Reports suggest that Ripple is considering a rebranding campaign to rebuild trust and reposition itself in the market. However, these efforts have done little to revive investor confidence or spark the kind of price rally that could make XRP a top contender in the crypto market once again. Why XRP’s Explosive Potential Is Fading Several factors contribute to the diminishing outlook for XRP: Legal Uncertainty: Despite recent legal wins, the ongoing threat of an appeal by the SEC continues to hang over Ripple (XRP). This uncertainty makes it difficult for the token to gain the kind of widespread adoption and investor confidence needed for a significant price surge. Market Saturation: The cryptocurrency market is more crowded than ever, with new and innovative projects constantly emerging. Ripple’s (XRP) original promise of revolutionizing cross-border payments has been overshadowed by newer technologies and competitors offering more decentralized and transparent solutions. Stagnant Price Action: XRP’s failure to break out of its current price range, even after positive legal news, suggests that the market is no longer reacting as enthusiastically to developments related to Ripple. Investors are growing weary of waiting for a price explosion that may never come. Trust Issues: The speculation around a potential PR stunt and the need for a rebranding campaign indicate that XRP’s reputation has taken a hit. Restoring trust in a market driven by sentiment is a challenging task, especially when newer and more exciting projects are capturing the public’s imagination. Diversifying With Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New Frontier As Ripple (XRP) struggles to reclaim its former glory, investors are increasingly looking towards alternative opportunities in the crypto market. One such opportunity is Mpeppe (MPEPE), a meme coin that is quickly gaining a reputation as a dark horse in the crypto space. Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a fresh and exciting alternative to stagnant assets like Ripple (XRP). Currently in its third stage of presale, MPEPE has already raised over $935,892, with 64.85% of its tokens sold. This strong presale performance indicates growing investor interest and confidence in the token’s potential. What makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) particularly appealing is its combination of meme culture and serious technological underpinnings. Unlike Ripple (XRP), which is bogged down by legal battles and a complicated relationship with the traditional financial system, MPEPE is unburdened by such baggage. It is designed to thrive in the current market environment, where community-driven projects and meme coins are capturing the spotlight. Moreover, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a robust smart contract system (address: 0xd328a1C97e9b6b3Afd42eAf535bcB55A85cDcA7B) that ensures transparency and security for all transactions, making it a trustworthy option for investors. As the token’s presale progresses, its price is set to increase, making now an opportune time for investors to get in early. Conclusion: The Case for Diversification While Ripple (XRP) may still have a place in the portfolios of those who believe in its long-term potential, the reality is that its explosive growth days may be behind it. Legal uncertainties, market saturation, and trust issues continue to weigh heavily on the token, making it less attractive to those seeking high returns in the near future. For investors looking to diversify and capture the next big opportunity in the crypto market, Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents a compelling case. With its strong presale performance, innovative approach, and the backing of a growing community, MPEPE is positioned to deliver the kind of returns that XRP once promised but has yet to deliver. In a market that rewards those who spot trends early, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a fresh and promising alternative. As Ripple (XRP) struggles to regain its footing, now might be the perfect time to diversify and explore new opportunities like MPEPE that are poised to dominate the next wave of crypto innovation.

32370467,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635151,1723568412,"Bitcoin And Altcoin Bull Run Will Return, Arthur Hayes Reveals Timeline","In a new essay, Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of crypto exchange BitMEX, has outlined a bullish future for Bitcoin and altcoins. His analysis, focused on the interplay between government liquidity operations and asset prices, suggests a looming bull market in the crypto space, driven by strategic fiscal maneuvers by the US Treasury. When Will The Bitcoin Bull Run Return? Hayes compares the quality of water in brewing coffee to the liquidity in financial markets, illustrating that just as the quality of water is crucial for making a good cup of coffee, liquidity is essential for the health and movement of financial markets. Hayes pointed out that many investors underestimate the impact of liquidity and often focus narrowly on more visible factors like technological advancements or regulatory changes. Hayes explains the concept of “fiscal dominance,” a situation where the government’s need to finance itself supersedes all other economic considerations, including the control of inflation. He specifically critiques the current policies under US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, whose tactics, according to Hayes, focus on generating nominal economic growth regardless of the inflationary outcomes. Related Reading: BTC’s Next Objective? Analyst Eyes Crucial $70,000 Resistance Zone For Bitcoin “During a period of fiscal dominance, the necessity to fund the state overrides any concerns the central bank may have about inflation,” Hayes explains. He details how this shift impacts liquidity, stating, “That means bank credit and, by extension, nominal GDP growth must be sustained at high levels even if it results in persistently higher than target inflation.” Drawing a direct connection between Treasury actions and crypto market movements, Hayes highlighted the correlation between the issuance of Treasury bills (T-bills) and Bitcoin price movements. He noted that when the Treasury increases T-bill issuance, it effectively shifts liquidity from instruments like the Reverse Repo Program (RRP) into more active uses, which historically corresponds with increases in Bitcoin prices. “As the RRP (white) fell from its high, Bitcoin (gold) pumped off the lows. As you can see, it’s a very tight relationship. As money leaves the Fed’s balance sheet, it adds liquidity, which causes Therefore, taking Bad Gurl Yellen’s word, we know that $301bn of T-bills will be net issued between now and year-end. If this relationship holds true, Bitcoin will quickly retrace the dump caused by the yen strengthening. The next stop for Bitcoin is $100,000″ Hayes speculates. When Altcoin Season? Therefore, Hayes advises crypto traders to pay close attention to fiscal and monetary policies, especially the actions of the US Treasury, as these are often precursors to significant market movements. Monitoring T-bill issuance and Treasury maneuvers can provide crypto investors with clues about upcoming shifts in market liquidity and potential price movements, according to Hayes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Again Show Extreme Fear As BTC Slips To $59,000 Shifting focus to the broader crypto market, Hayes also discusses the potential for an ‘alt szn’ or altcoin season, which he predicts will follow a rally in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. “Shitcoins are higher beta Bitcoin crypto plays. But during this cycle, Bitcoin and now Ether have structural bids in the form of net inflows into US-listed exchange-traded funds (ETF). While Bitcoin and Ether have corrected since April, they escaped the carnage experienced in the shitcoin markets.” Commenting on the potential of a full blown altcoin season like in previous cycles, Hayes assures that the time will come. However, altcoin season will only return after Bitcoin and Ether “decidedly break through $70,000 and $4,000, respectively.” He adds, “the combination of a dollar liquidity-inspired Bitcoin and Ether rally into year-end will create a strong foundation for the return of a sexy shitcoin soiree.” Interestingly, Hayes plans to capitalize on the US elections. He expects that the crypto bull run will exit its “sideways-to-downward trajectory” in September. “The US election occurs in early November. Yellen will be at peak manipulation in October. There will be no better time for liquidity this year. Therefore, I shall sell into strength. I will not liquidate my entire crypto portfolio but take profits in my more speculative momentum trades,” he revealed. Hayes further anticipates a more substantial market adjustment post US election and the US debt ceiling resolutions, “Once the US debt ceiling charade is over, liquidity will gush from the Treasury and possibly the Fed to get markets back on track. Then, the bull market will begin for realz. $1 million Bitcoin is still my base case.” At press time, BTC traded at $58,783.

Brown in Ohio, PAC Says","The crypto industry's leading political action committee, Fairshake, announced three U.S. Senate races it intends to spend major amounts to influence in Ohio, Arizona and Michigan.  The Ohio race pits a crypto ally, Bernie Moreno, against the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who has been reluctant to allow crypto legislation to advance in his committee.  Crypto interests are planning to go after Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) in their biggest-ever single campaign, setting aside $12 million to support the Republican candidate seeking to snatch the Senate seat from the current chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, who has been highly critical of the digital assets sector and reluctant to embrace crypto legislation.  The organizers of the Fairshake political action committee (PAC) and its affiliates said Tuesday that they're reserving TV advertising time in Ohio and two other key states – Arizona and Michigan. They're targeting $12 million in Ohio airtime to push for Republican candidate Bernie Moreno, a blockchain businessman, and they're devoting about $3 million each to advocate for U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) in the Arizona Senate race and Rep. Elisa Slotkin (D-Mich.) in her Senate race in Michigan.  ""Our mission is clear – support candidates who embrace innovation, want to protect American jobs and are committed to working across the aisle to get things done and oppose those who do not,"" Fairshake spokesman Josh Vlasto said in a statement. The group is aiming for a ""sustainable bipartisan coalition and a consensus that there is an urgent need to pass responsible crypto and blockchain-focused regulation.""  Read More: Crypto PAC Fairshake Claims Another Win Against Elizabeth Warren Ally With Bush Loss  This opening round of general-election Senate support follows a recent announcement from Fairshake that it would be backing 18 members of the House of Representatives in the November elections. All were incumbents, so far, and had records of supporting crypto in office.  The group's ads during its involvement with dozens of races in the primaries – with few exceptions – haven't mentioned the crypto positions of the candidates being supported or opposed.  Fairshake and its related PACs – the Democrat-oriented Protect Progress and the Republican-focused Defend American Jobs – will also devote resources to digital ads that specifically target crypto users, the group said.  The crypto industry's PACs are among the biggest by dollar amount in the 2024 elections, rivaling other major U.S. industries and the parties' own inside funding. Fairshake has focused so far on congressional races and steered clear of the presidential contest, and it's carefully divided its support across party lines. The $10 million it spent toward derailing the Senate bid of Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) marked the most it's previously channeled into a single race.

In some cases, predictions have reached as high as $1,000 for the cryptocurrency, but one crypto analyst is going in the opposite direction. In a recent analysis, Alan Santana has predicted a crash for the SOL price that could eliminate all of its gains from the past week. Solana Shows Similar Patterns To 2023 In the analysis, crypto analyst Alan Santana points out that the Solana cryptocurrency is showing similarities to a trend that was seen back in 2023. Last year, the trend was with a rise in the trading volume of the altcoin, which was the start of a bullish run. However, this time around, there is more of a bearish run in the volume, which could suggest the beginning of a bearish trend for the digital asset. Related Reading: Celsius Takes Legal Action Against Tether In $2.4 Bitcoin Collateral Controversy Back in July 2023, Solana saw a notable rise in the buying volume, which was the highest level at the time. As the analyst points out, this strong buying volume began after around 45 days of bullish price action for the altcoin. The result of this was a continuation of bullish rallying, eventually reaching as high as $209 less than one year later. Applying this trend to the current trend could help to identify where the Solana price could be headed next. This time around, there has been a notable uptick in the selling volume of SOL. It is coming after 140 days of continuous bearish action on the SOL price. Using the result of the 2023 trend here would tell us that the Solana price could be headed for a further crash. Given that the current selling volume is the highest in over a year, the resulting crash is expected to be quite significant. How Low Will The SOL Price Go? With the bearish sell pressure mounting on the Solana price, it has posed a threat to SOL’s triple-digit status. In his chart, Alan Santana points out multiple levels where he sees the SOL price falling to, and both of them are below the $100 mark. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says End Of This Bitcoin Bear Trap Could Drive Price To $72,000 The first of the two is around $90, which is around a 40% price decline from its current level. Moving love, the second target is placed below $60, meaning an over 50% decline in price. Additionally, a drop to this level would mean a new one year high, since the SOL price hasn’t been below $60 since November 2023.

User intents are solved off-chain by a network of solvers in order to reduce on-chain computation.  Blockchain project Essential has raised $11 million in Series A funding led by Archetype and with participation from several other high-profile investors.  Essential's aim is to offer an ""intent-centric, declarative approach."" This differs from traditional blockchain in that it leverages users' ""intents"" for desired outcomes rather than usual transaction-based interactions where users must specify exact instructions, according to an emailed statement on Tuesday.  These intents are then solved off-chain by a network of solvers in order to reduce on-chain computation, enabling users to be hands-off from the step-by-step ""how to"" part of a transaction.  ""This shift from an imperative to a declarative model addresses many UX issues inherent in transaction-based systems, significantly improving user and developer experience while enhancing scalability,"" Essential said.  Some other projects that are using the same process include Anoma and UniswapX.  Essential is also rolling out ""Pint,"" a new language for programmable intents for developers to build on the blockchain, according to the statement.

Users on Reddit are making unverified claims about receiving BTC and BCH balances on BitGo.  A crypto wallet that recently received $2 billion of bitcoin {{BTC}} from defunct exchange Mt. Gox's trustee initiated a test transaction on Tuesday, perhaps to prepare distributing funds to creditors, blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence noted.  Arkham analysts said the wallet that initiated the transfer likely belongs to crypto custody platform BitGo, one of the five service providers that distribute tokens to creditors. BitGo is the last remaining distribution partners, they added.  The test transaction followed a 33,100 BTC transfer two weeks ago, worth $2.2 billion at the time, from a Mt. Gox cold wallet holding creditors' funds.  Arkham explained the process of tagging the wallet as likely BitGo in a Telegram message to CoinDesk. ""The address was clustered with a large input cluster which we were able to identify as BitGo due to custody structure and wallet types used,"" an Arkham analyst said. ""We’ve also been able to identify the other fur exchange partners used for Mt. Gox distributions, so there’s also a process of elimination.""  Meanwhile, some users in a reddit channel dedicated to Mt. Gox creditors reported that they received funds to their BitGo accounts. CoinDesk hasn't verified the claims.  BitGo didn't return a request by CoinDesk to confirm the transaction as of press time.  Japan-based Mt. Gox was at one point the largest bitcoin exchange before imploding in 2014 due to a hack. The distribution of over 140,000 BTC and similar amount of bitcoin cash {{BCH}} has been a major source of concern for investors, worried about creditors selling assets to realize profits after ten years of waiting.  The trustee managing Mt. Gox assets started distributing tokens in early July, sending BTC prices plunging below $54,000 on the news. The exchanges approved by the trustee for creditor repayments include Bitbank, BitGo, Bistamp, Kraken and SBI VC Trade.  Mt. Gox addresses currently hold 46,000 BTC, down from 141,000 on July 1, Arkham data shows.",NEUTRAL,BCH,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | ARKM,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/13/crypto-wallet-holding-2b-mt-gox-bitcoin-sends-test-transaction-as-distribution-continues-arkham,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/291af9f53b88bc829a6f59825de0b112a5c43631-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390622,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd4LDL,1723558146,"With Broadband Growth Stalling, Real World Assets Offer a Lifeline","As the United States grapples with modernizing its outdated infrastructure, we’re quickly discovering that government initiatives and legacy providers aren’t enough to fill the nation’s gaps – particularly when it comes to telecoms and broadband.  While the federal Affordable Connectivity Program promised Americans fast and cost-effective internet, it's on the verge of shutting down. Meanwhile, many private-sector internet projects have slowed amid high interest rates, leading to bankruptcies and closures. For the one-in-four Americans who still lack access to high speed broadband, affordable options are becoming sparse.  It’s clear that the traditional methods for expanding connectivity – government subsidies and legacy telecom projects – aren’t working. But innovative technologies exist to bridge this divide.  A modern approach can be found in a technology that is gaining traction in the blockchain industry. Tokenized real world assets (RWAs) are digital tokens on a blockchain that represent physical and traditional financial assets, enabling more efficient and transparent management, trading, and ownership.  Despite some skepticism still surrounding crypto, the underlying technology’s capacity to enhance the development of tangible, real world infrastructure is substantial. Recent attention to this concept of RWA reveals a huge opportunity – one that Boston Consulting Group projects will grow to a $13 trillion market by 2030.  The power of on-chain transparency and programmability unlocks new ways of managing and funding telecom and other utility networks; this new paradigm offers flexibility and risk mitigation to historically brittle and inefficient systems. What’s known as “Liquid Infrastructure,” removes barriers for large infrastructure projects to access capital and allows nontraditional investors, smaller companies and communities to directly participate in building the infrastructure they need.  As blockchain facilitates a machine-to-machine payment system that supports automated settlements, this framework promotes dynamic pricing models and automated transactions and empowers small investors and local communities to have a direct stake in infrastructure projects. Liquid infrastructure is designed for maximum flexibility and allows for single-asset fractionalization as well as multi-asset distribution. This means that the revenue of several different liquid assets can be automatically distributed to a single set of fungible tokens.  Hawk Networks has tokenized most of its wireless networks and recently used the Liquid Infrastructure platform to build connectivity to a 194 unit veterans housing in Phoenix Arizona. This apartment was built using Althea's payment platform and Liquid Infrastructures coordinates payments between multiple participants in the funding and operation of the build.  In the case of internet infrastructure, RWA can enable communities to build their own fiber optic network, or harness the power of Starlink to serve entire neighborhoods. I’m often out in the field speaking directly with these communities in need of broadband and how they leverage blockchain technology, and have seen it firsthand from the Arctic Circle to rural America.  Beyond internet infrastructure, the adaptability of RWA holds extensive benefits to other vital sectors such as the energy grid and physical infrastructure, and the ability to transform how these utilities are financed and managed. Liquid infrastructure doesn’t aim to supplant government or private sector efforts, but instead seeks to fill the gaps where these traditional approaches fall short.  As the nation strives to address critical infrastructure deficits, RWAs provide a unique opportunity to close existing gaps while fostering a more inclusive and equitable framework for future infrastructure development.

The analysts’ guestimate this bull market could have AVAX reach as high as $230 to $285 — which is quite a huge appreciation from the current price of approximately $21. However, some hurdles will be met on the way. As affirmed by the prognosis, a vital resistance hangs in the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. This could see AVAX touch the projected highs if it finally breaks out past this level. Until then, its future remains unclear regarding where the market would head. AVAX Price Action In the price action department, AVAX is shown losing 2.25% over the last day. In the last week, the altcoin could only muster a 0.9% gain. Given the 24-hour Long/Short ratio of 0.786, traders seem to be heading toward short holdings, which reflects bearishness.

According to him, the current phase of correction is an imperative one, which would lead to another phase of accumulation. This could then give way to a big breakout. Santana even calls for AVAX to hit a new all-time high of $382, relying on extended Fibonacci levels. Bullish And Bearish Signals AVAX’s chart is balanced, with both bearish and bullish indications having a bearing. The long-term view is supported by technical analysis and historical patterns, projecting a considerable price increase, but in the short run, there are indications that price drops and consolidation would defer the probable rally. Related Reading: Solana Rockets Up 23% As Developments Spark Investor Interest It will be interesting to watch AVAX over the next few weeks. Will it begin a climb towards expected highs and break through the resistance it is now facing, or would further drops be propelled by a dominance of short-term negativity?

Still, it is underpriced based on potential revenues to be obtained from HPC or High-Performance Computing leasing. Also, volatility is likely to continue in the short term due to predominant exposure to digital assets, but the strong operational performance and HPC focus are key advantages. Also, it bears high debt, but continued diversification into hosting versus self-mining means more stable cash flow generation. The company achieved milestones, leased a data center in Austin, and secured a contract with CoreWeave for 382 megawatts, with potential revenue of $6.7 billion. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has been highly volatile after the halving event on April 19 as per the chart below, flirting with the $73 level then dipping to $50K, and stabilizing around $60K, for now. In its wake, Core Scientific ( CORZ ) also suffered, but still delivered a net upside of above 200% and was trading around $9.75 at the time of writing. Data by YCharts This is largely due to its strong execution in keeping mining costs down and rapidly delivering on the HPC or High-Performance Computing mandate, as I detail further. Thus, this thesis aims to show that it deserves better, and to make my point, I will compare it with an industry peer, but I start by showing how it has adapted to the post-halving period characterized by challenges for miners. Post-Halving Challenges The halving event has brought a lot of pain for Bitcoin miners in general, as the reward for creating a block using time-consuming and complex mathematical calculations and adding it to the blockchain network has been reduced by half from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. At the same time, the cost of production which mostly consists of energy has either remained the same or increased in the face of higher inflation, without forgetting wages having to be adjusted upward. Add to this higher interest rates of above 5% which inflates the cost of refinancing and creates financial stress for those whose balance sheets are not strong enough as a result of not having HODLed (accumulated) sufficient coins for hard times. In consequence, they can either go bankrupt or end up being acquired. In this respect, there is the example of non-profitable and indebted miner GRIID Infrastructure ( GRDI ) as I recently elaborated in a recent piece. It was acquired by CleanSpark ( CLSK ) for an enterprise value of $155 million at the end of June, with the acquirer assuming Griid's debt and providing working capital as part of the deal. Furthermore, with fewer bitcoins remaining to be mined, the degree of competition has gone up, which has considerably increased mining difficulty (by around 67%) for miners in general as shown in the chart below. This again shows the need to become more efficient, which for miners means investing in the latest and most efficient mining rigs like the S21 from manufacturers like Bitmain. Data by YCharts In these conditions, miners who had priorly planned the halving event and adjusted their operations have been rewarded by the market, which is the case for Core Scientific which derived 78% of its revenues from mining Bitcoin directly (self-mining) during the second quarter of 2024 (Q2). The rest consisted of income from leases of hosting space to other miners (18%) and the emerging HPC business (4%). Reducing Production Costs and Generating Operating Income Looking deeper into the adjustment, one metric that it has been able to control is the cash cost to mine, which is the total power consumed and operating costs of its self-mining and hosting facilities divided by the total number of Bitcoins it mined. Thus, cash cost to mine increased by 60% in Q2 to $29.9K compared to the same period last year. Normally, this should have gone up by 100% had not the company not migrated its mining rigs to sites with more favorable power pricing and transitioned to newer equipment such as the 10K new S21 between March 31 and April 30. Second Quarter Results from earnings call presentation (seekingalpha.com) In addition, instead of engaging in a race to increase the number of coins minted, the miner has adopted a fleet curtailment strategy to mitigate the effects of the halving, seeing it produce 447 in May, down from 803 in April. Thus, it produced 430 and 411 Bitcoins in June and July, respectively. Pursing further, it earned 1,680 coins and generated $141 million in sales in Q2, which it used to pay for operational expenses which have increased compared to the same period last year as shown below . Still, it was able to increase its operating income. SEC Filings (seekingalpha.com) Shifting to the balance sheet, the company's strategy is to sell Bitcoins to the tune of 401 and 479 in July and June respectively has also enabled it to avoid borrowing and increase debt. On the contrary, it was able to reduce debt to $552 million, or by $56 million, mainly by voluntarily converting senior notes into equity. This not only reduces the interest payment burden for a company whose total debt of $621 million exceeded its cash position of $96 million at the end of Q2, but also demonstrates the willingness of creditors (bondholders) to exchange debt for shares at a time of digital asset volatility. This also shows confidence in light of the company emerging from Chapter 11 Bankruptcy and diversifying into HPC. The Diversification into HPC This strategy got a boost on Aug 6 after AI hyperscaler CoreWeave exercised an additional contract option for the delivery of approximately 112 MW (megawatts) of additional infrastructure, as illustrated below. This extended the previous agreement, bringing the total contracted infrastructure capacity to 382 MW at five sites. CoreWeave can optionally request a further expansion of 118 MW to bring the total to 500 MW. Just a note on CoreWeave , it specializes in providing AI and cloud computing infrastructure to customers to host their HPC workloads in contrast with conventional data center service providers (also called colocation providers) like Digital Realty Trust ( DLR ) which cater to more general requirements. Thus, it procures GPUs from Nvidia ( NVDA ) to house them in the energized facilities it leases from Core Scientific. investors.corescientific.com Looking across the industry, Bit Digital ( BTBT ) has also diversified into HPC infrastructure leasing and is on track to benefit from around $275 million of HPC-related revenues during the next three years, or $92 million per year. Thinking aloud, investors may find it difficult to understand why AI hyperscalers have turned to miners instead of building up their infrastructure or leasing space from data center colocation providers. The reason is that the GPUs being supplied by Nvidia are power-hungrier than normal CPUs by over two times and colocation facilities are not necessarily equipped to handle the energy demands, and they are mostly located in large metro areas like North Virginia where utilities cannot provide them the additional power needed due to high demand and restrictions . Thus, there is a need for AI-specific data centers, and here, the advantage of miners is that in their quest for cheaper and renewable power sources to mine Bitcoin, they already dispose of facilities that can be used to host HPC. In this case, Core Scientific operates 830 megawatts, but its total contract covers 1,200 watts. Thus, as a result of being contracted by CoreWeave, the miner could potentially generate $6.7 billion over the next 12 years from HPC hosting beginning from the first half of 2026, or around $550 million on an annualized basis. This is six times Bit Digital's while Core Scientific's trailing price-to-sales is trading only slightly above , which means that it deserves better valuations. Valuing Core Scientific First, for clarification purposes, the $6.7 billion represents an addition of $2 billion on the previous one signed on June 25 which amounted to $4.7 billion for 12 years, or $391.67 million per year. Now, the consensus revenue estimate of $796.42 million shown below already seems to include this amount but the last review done on August 9 (or one day after the contract signature) only adds around $2 million to the previous estimate of $794.49 million, instead of $167.67 million, which is the amount obtained by dividing the additional $2 billion by 12 years. Thus, adding this amount increases the revenue estimate to $962.67 million, which increases the YoY growth to 37.66% and conversely reduces the forward price to sales to 2.61x. This translates into a target of $11.7 (962.67/796.42 x 9.7) based on the current share price of $9.7. Table built using data from (seekingalpha.com) To further justify this bullish stance, the company's trailing price-to-sales of 4.98x is slightly above Bit Digital's as shown in the table below while it is on track to receive six times more HPC-related sales. Furthermore, in case CoreWeave exercises the optionality to request a further expansion of 118 MW (from the existing 382 MW), the total under HPC leasing could be brought to 500 MW, placing Core Scientific in the same league as one of the ten largest data center operators in the world. This is the reason I have extended the comparison to the colocation giant whose higher P/S of 8.69x shows that Core Digital remains underpriced despite its 200% upside since Bitcoin halving. Comparison with peers (seekingalpha.com) Therefore, I valued the company about 20% higher, but this is more from a long-term perspective as it executes on HPC. Risks Because of Bitcoin Mining But Should Generate More Cash From HPC However, in the meantime, since it derives more than three-quarters of its revenues from Bitcoin mining (chart below), the company remains vulnerable to crypto volatility as the price of the digital asset can fluctuate dramatically, directly impacting Core Scientific's revenue and margins. Also, at this stage, HPC contributes to much lower gross margins or 11%. Company presentation (seekingalpha.com) Another factor that plays against profitability is network difficulty, which affects the profitability of mining operations. These effects can be contained depending on how fast it can diversify to HPC. To this end, it has been rapidly progressing after leasing a 16-megawatt data center in Austin whose expansion was completed ahead of schedule thereby enabling sales to be generated in Q2 itself, and as part of a separate HPC business segment. Moreover, it distinguishes itself from other players in its industry, first by generating cash from operations (table above), largely due to hosting Bitcoin miners at its facilities thus obtaining stable leasing revenue. Looking forward, as the contribution of HPC leasing increases, it should generate more cash from operations and even land a positive FCF given the capital expenses for transforming facilities to accommodate AI computing are being borne by CoreWeave. This capital-light strategy also means less likelihood of increasing its debt load. Coming back to the price action, the $11.7 target corresponds to the peak attained on July 16 seen in the chart below, and subsequently, the shares reached a trough of $8.2 on August 5 before news about the HPC contract extension propelled the shares higher. Therefore, in the absence of another catalyst and amid all the AI hype as I had elaborated upon in a previous piece , the shares can be under pressure. seekingalpha.com Finally, there are short-term risks, but because of Core Scientific's ability to execute both on adjusting to Bitcoin halving and to support AI infrastructure, it is a buy.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4713978-core-scientific-deserves-better-as-hpc-moves-into-high-gear?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/32364372.jpeg

Cú bứt phá này đưa BTC trở lại trên mốc $60,000 sau khi bị bán tháo vào tháng 8, giảm tới 33.32% từ đỉnh cao nhất mọi thời đại $73,666. Đây cũng là cú té ngửa đau nhất trong chu kỳ này của Bitcoin! Các chỉ số cũng “kể chuyện buồn”: Mayer Multiple tụt xuống mức 0.88, thấp nhất kể từ vụ FTX sập nguồn vào tháng 11/2022. Tức là Bitcoin đang giao dịch thấp hơn nhiều so với xu hướng lịch sử, đúng kiểu “ế ẩm” luôn. Các chỉ số on-chain cũng cho thấy đợt bán tháo vừa rồi ác liệt cỡ nào. Giá vốn của các nhà đầu tư ngắn hạn (STH) là $64,860, trong khi đó, giá giao ngay của Bitcoin đã gần độ lệch chuẩn -1 (SD) dưới STH Cost-Basis này, một sự kiện hiếm gặp, trong lịch sử chỉ thấy trong khoảng 7,1% số ngày giao dịch. Điều này làm nổi bật độ nghiêm trọng của điều kiện thị trường trong hiện tại. Tỷ lệ MVRV của Người nắm giữ ngắn hạn (STH MVRV), so sánh giá thị trường hiện tại với giá mua đối với các nhà đầu tư mới hơn, cho thấy nhóm này đang nắm giữ khoản lỗ chưa thực hiện lớn nhất kể từ mức thấp của thị trường gấu năm 2022. Nhìn chung, các chỉ số này nhấn mạnh tâm lý giảm giá sâu sắc và căng thẳng trong số các nhà đầu tư ngắn hạn, điều thường xảy ra ở các đáy cục bộ. Tin vui từ Mỹ khi nền kinh tế vẫn “ cứng đầu ”, số liệu MVRV mới nhất cho thấy triển vọng khả quan hơn, dù vẫn có lo ngại về suy thoái. Tuần trước, số người xin trợ cấp thất nghiệp giảm mạnh , hàng tồn kho bán buôn tăng đều , tạo nền tảng vững chắc cho tăng trưởng kinh tế. Nợ hộ gia đình thì tăng nhẹ, nhưng tỷ lệ nợ xấu vẫn ổn định , chứng tỏ người dân vẫn đang “gồng gánh” nền kinh tế. Tuy nhiên, tốc độ vay nợ chậm lại và áp lực tài chính tăng cao có thể khiến người tiêu dùng “thắt lưng buộc bụng”, làm giảm tăng trưởng kinh tế nếu FED không chịu giảm lãi suất. Tin tốt là lĩnh vực dịch vụ Mỹ đã hồi sinh mạnh mẽ vào tháng 7, phục hồi từ mức thấp nhất trong 4 năm. Điều này có thể xoa dịu nỗi lo suy thoái, đặc biệt là sau khi tỷ lệ thất nghiệp tăng vọt và thị trường chứng khoán “trồi sụt” liên tục. “Drama” từ thế giới crypto: Kamala Harris đang dẫn đầu cuộc đua tổng thống Mỹ 2024, bỏ xa Donald Trump. Giới crypto đang “ hóng hớt ” xem bà có ủng hộ tiền điện tử không, vì đội ngũ của bà đã bắt đầu tiếp xúc với các ông lớn trong ngành. Các tổ chức tài chính “máu mặt” như BlackRock và Nasdaq cũng đang nhảy vào thị trường crypto. Họ vừa nộp đơn xin SEC cho phép giao dịch quyền chọn cho ETF Ethereum giao ngay của BlackRock. SEC thì vẫn đang “cẩn thận từng li từng tí”, quyết định hoãn phê duyệt ETF Bitcoin và Ether giao ngay của Hashdex đến 30/9/2024. Nói chung là Bitcoin đã có một cú lội ngược dòng ngoạn mục sau cú “té ngửa” lịch sử. Thị trường đang nín thở chờ xem diễn biến tiếp theo. Nền kinh tế Mỹ thì có vẻ ổn áp hơn, nhưng vẫn còn nhiều thử thách. Kamala Harris đang là ngôi sao sáng trong cuộc đua tổng thống, và giới crypto đang hóng xem bà sẽ làm gì với thị trường này. Các tổ chức tài chính lớn cũng đang dấn thân vào crypto, còn SEC thì vẫn chậm-mà-chắc. Và đó là Bitfinex Alpha 117. Đầu tư thông minh, lợi nhuận đỉnh cao tuần mới nhé!

The new closed-end fund will be accessible to eligible individual and institutional accredited investors.  Grayscale, the asset manager company behind bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} exchange traded-funds (ETFs) and other crypto investment funds, introduced Tuesday a new fund that invests in the governance token of decentralized lending platform MakerDAO {{MKR}}.  MKR advanced over 5% in an hour following the news, hitting $2,100. The token is up nearly 8% over the past 24 hours, outperforming the mostly flat broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index.  The Grayscale MakerDAO Trust is accessible to eligible individual and institutional accredited investors, and has the same structure as the firm's other single-asset trusts, according to a press release. This means that it's a closed-end fund where direct withdrawals are not possible, which could lead to price deviations between the fund's share on secondary markets and the underlying asset.

Those who hold MKR tokens can participate in decision-making and vote on proposals. The protocol manages over $7 billion of crypto and real-world assets (RWA) including U.S. Treasuries and issues the third largest stablecoin on the market, the $5 billion DAI.

32363341,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635155,1723552222,"Ethereum Nears Key Bearish Triangle Apex: Breakdown To $2,160 Target Looms","Recent trading activities reveal that Ethereum is approaching a crucial point in its trading as it forms a bearish triangle pattern, signaling a potential significant breakout. If the cryptocurrency breaks below the lower boundary of this triangle, it could lead to a sharp decline towards the $2,160 target. This article aims to provide readers with a detailed technical analysis of Ethereum’s price action, emphasizing the importance of the bearish triangle pattern that has emerged on the charts. It will also explore how this pattern indicates a potential downward move toward the $2,160 support level. In the past 24 hours, Ethereum has gone up by 2.11%, reaching around $2,642, with a market capitalization of over $317 billion and a trading volume exceeding $21 billion at the time of writing. ETH’s market cap has increased by 2.32%, while its trading volume has surged by 33.62% Analyzing Current Price Actions Within The Bearish Triangle On the 4-hour chart, ETH’s price is currently trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and is moving closer to the lower boundary of a bearish triangle, with several bearish candlesticks forming. This indicates a prevailing bearish sentiment in the market and suggests the potential for further price declines. Additionally, an examination of the 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator reveals that both the signal line and the SMA line are currently in the overbought zone, with the signal line attempting to cross below the SMA line. This suggests that bearish pressure is building up for the cryptocurrency, potentially resulting in more price declines. On the 1-day chart, Ethereum remains below the 100-day SMA and, with a single bearish candlestick, is approaching the lower boundary of the bearish triangle. Given the current price action on the daily timeframe, it appears that bearish momentum is increasing, which could potentially lead to a price breakout. Finally, the composite trend oscillator on the 1-day chart also suggests a potential for continued bearish movement, with both the signal line and the SMA line in the oversold zone, showing no signs of crossing above. Potential Scenarios For Ethereum Following A Breakout If Ethereum’s current trading activities lead to a breakout below the bearish triangle, the price may continue to descend toward the $2,160 support level. When the crypto asset reaches this level and breaks below, it could lead to a further bearish move toward other lower levels. However, if Ethereum fails to break below, it might start moving toward the upper boundary of the bearish triangle. Should the cryptocurrency break above this upper boundary, ETH could continue to rise to test the $2,816 resistance range and possibly advance to challenge higher levels if the price surpasses this resistance.

42417462,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYVht,1723550792,First Mover Americas: BTC Muted After Crypto Goes Unmentioned in Musk-Trump Interview,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,900 −1.6% Bitcoin (BTC): $58,871 −1.5% Ether (ETH): $2,644 −1.0% S&P 500: 5,344.39 +0.0% Gold: $2,463 +0.0% Nikkei 225: 36,232.51 +3.45%  Top Stories  The digital asset market was muted after crypto went unmentioned during the X space between Elon Musk and Donald Trump. BTC traded at around $58,750 during the European morning, down just over 1% from its price of 24 hours ago. The broader crypto market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), dropped by a similar amount. The two-hour interview between the X owner Elon Musk and the Republican presidential candidate attracted over 1 million listeners and was highly anticipated by the crypto community, but cryptocurrency didn't come up. On Polymarket, bettors priced a 65% chance of ""crypto"" being mentioned with over $600,000 in stakes on the topic.  One bitcoin analyst sees renewed losses in the short term, with the price falling by $5,000 from the going market rate of around $58,500. ""Bitcoin is likely to fall by $5K rather than rise by the same amount,"" Alex Kuptsikevich of FxPro said in an email. Kuptsikevich's bearish take stemmed from bitcoin's failure to keep gains above $60,000 in the wake of the death cross, a bearish crossover of the 50- and 200-day simple moving averages. ""Bitcoin does not break above $60K and faces selling after it tried to break above the 50- and 200-day MAs late last week, showing seller dominance,"" Kuptsikevich noted. He added that the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) no longer shows oversold conditions, which means scope for another leg lower, consistent with the recent seller dominance above $60,000.  Data from SoSoValue shows that daily net inflow into the U.S.-listed spot ether ETFs hit $4.93 million on Monday. Grayscale's two funds posted no flows, while Fidelity's FETH hit $3.98 million in inflow, Franklin Templeton's EZET posted $1 million, and Bitwise's ETHW clocked $2.86 million in positive flow. VanEck's ETHV was the only one that posted an outflow of $2.92 million. Meanwhile, bitcoin ETFs posted a collective daily inflow of $27.87 million. Of the lot, Grayscale's GBTC had an outflow of $11.7 million, while Bitwise's BITB had an outflow of $17 million.

42417463,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYVgr,1723550400,Crypto Insiders Courting Vice President Harris Chase Whispers of Her Openness,"While U.S. crypto insiders continue to pound away at a noncommittal Biden administration, a more urgent mission is developing to find out the digital assets views of Vice President Kamala Harris, though her dual life as vice president and presidential candidate may interfere with taking a strong stance.  Industry insiders have been conducting meetings with officials connected to the White House, and though one of those meetings last week included a senior adviser from Harris' own office, the sessions have been predominantly one-sided and had nothing to do with her campaign. Meanwhile, some crypto executives and investors are pursuing a few emerging efforts to support Harris as the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, even without a direct indication of how she'll approach the sector.  Read More: Bitcoin and Crypto Go Unmentioned During Trump-Musk X Space  This week, the fledgling ""crypto4harris"" effort kicks off Wednesday with an online forum at which prominent industry figures are expected to gather under the vice president's banner. Such initiatives don't yet have formal ties to the Harris campaign.  Amanda Wick, a former federal prosecutor who now consults in crypto and has been helping organize industry support for Harris, said the objective at this point is to get Harris to publicly acknowledge ""an openness and a willingness to have a reset"" with the sector.  ""It's a really important industry; it's a really important voting block; it's a really important source of fundraising,"" said Veronica McGregor, the chief legal officer for crypto wallet provider Exodus who is also helping organize the Harris events, in an interview. ""And most crypto people I know intend to put their money where their mouth is and support candidates who are not trying to kill the industry.""  McGregor said that multiple people working on the crypto4harris project are in contact with the vice president's campaign, even if it's not at a formal level. Wick declined to delve into details on the Harris campaign's interactions with crypto supporters, but she said, “We have seen indicators from the campaign team that they’re open to having a conversation.”  With just a few months left before the November election, crypto players continue knocking on all the political doors to chase their main U.S. goal: A clear set of rules for using and trading cryptocurrency. That included a meeting two weeks ago between crypto business leaders and Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo in San Francisco, according to a person familiar with the discussion. Adeyemo has been staying in touch with crypto leaders to discuss policy initiatives he's been working on, the person said.  Vice presidential limitations  While those in the digital assets sector remain frustrated that Harris isn't yet rolling out her own pro-crypto message, some cite the constraints of a vice president whose job description requires supporting the current administration.  ""I don't think you can expect a sitting vice president to say, 'Oh, well, my boss was completely wrong on this. Let me tell you what we're going to do,'"" McGregor said. ""I just don't think you can expect that. That's asking a lot.""  Former President Donald Trump doesn't face such constraints. Though his own administration didn't embrace the emerging technology when he first had the chance, he's become a digital assets cheerleader in recent weeks. As a result, some prominent industry leaders have given him their support and their money with the hope that a second Trump administration will reverse the enforcement pursuits and compliance clashes of the Biden administration.  ""His pandering is now finding fans in people who have been in the desert and are happy to head towards an oasis, even if it's a mirage,"" Wick said in an interview.  Harris said over the weekend that she'll roll out her economic policy views in the coming days, though there's no indication yet that it'll include mention of digital tokens. Her campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on crypto4harris.  Industry insiders have balked this week at some of the news of Harris' campaign hires, because the officials -- including President Joe Biden's former director of his National Economic Council, Brian Deese, and Bharat Ramamurti, who was the council's deputy director -- have been associated with past actions against crypto. She's also tapped Brian Nelson, a former senior Treasury Department who spent some of his tenure scrutinizing the role of digital assets in terrorism and illicit finance, but she also brought on David Plouffe, a high-profile Democratic political mind who has more recently advised crypto companies. Because Harris hasn't announced her position, these hiring decisions have been read as a proxy.  The vice president may not be in a position to match Trump's enthusiasm, but the sudden emergence of her campaign has sparked excitement among crypto Democrats and those who weren't eager to support Trump.  ""There's a lot of energy in this campaign, more than we've seen since, I think, maybe [President Barack] Obama,"" McGregor said. ""There's a lot of people trying to jump in, 'What can I do?' I see that a lot.""  A poll fielded by crypto investment firm Paradigm may indicate that Harris has a chance to change the minds of some Democratic token enthusiasts who've resented the Biden administration's actions, according to the results released by the company on Monday.  White House meetings  Even as the candidates battle for the future White House, the industry is still trying to deal with the administration of President Biden. Digital assets leaders have been conducting highly publicized meetings with current federal officials, including the one last week, where Coinbase (COIN) Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal – for one – advocated support for federal legislation.  ""Any conversation on moving beyond this administration's unproductive record on crypto is positive,"" Grewal said in a statement. ""It isn't too late, but time is running short. The White House should publicly back the Senate's efforts to pass a bipartisan market structure bill much as the House has done and sign it into law.""  So far, the administration has been only vaguely supportive of doing something about cryptocurrency. The two well-publicized recent roundtables with White House officials and the Adeyemo meeting with a few crypto firms haven't yet produced concrete results.  The Harris supporters say one of their chief aims is to insist that cryptocurrency not drift into partisan territory in the U.S., which had been indicated by the industry's increasing lean toward Trump and Republicans.  The Republican Party formally adopted a pro-crypto position in its official platform. The Democrats, who will attend their national convention next week in Chicago, have already released a draft of their own platform, which doesn't embrace crypto despite the efforts of some lawmakers to get it included.  Read More: Democratic Crypto Supporters Call for Crypto-Friendly Party Platform  ""When other countries are picking up speed, when we have a debt crisis, when the dollar is progressively weakening, the ramifications of getting this wrong should scare everybody, regardless of party, and there are Dems that see that and who are trying to raise their voices,"" Wick said.

42417459,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYVen,1723549346,Bitcoin More Likely to Fall by $5K Than Rise by Same Amount: Analyst,"The BTC market shows signs of seller dominance, FxPro's analyst said.  BTC's recovery has stalled with Harris pulling ahead of Trump in prediction markets.  Bitcoin's {{BTC}} swift recovery from the sub-$50,000 price seen last Monday has restored bullish sentiment in the crypto market, spurring calls for a rally to $90,000 and higher.  One analyst, however, sees renewed losses in the short term, with the price falling by $5,000 from the going market rate of around $58,500.  ""Bitcoin is likely to fall by $5K rather than rise by the same amount,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, said in an email.  Kuptsikevich's bearish take stemmed from bitcoin's failure to keep gains above $60,000 in the wake of the death cross, a bearish crossover of the 50- and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA).  ""Bitcoin does not break above $60K and faces selling after it tried to break above the 50- and 200-day MAs late last week, showing seller dominance,"" Kuptsikevich noted.  He added that the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) no longer shows oversold conditions, which means scope for another leg lower, consistent with the recent seller dominance above $60,000.  The 14-day RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. An RSI below 30, observed after last Monday's crash, indicates oversold conditions, often presaging a pause in the downtrend and price recovery.  ""The RSI index on the daily timeframe has moved out of oversold territory, losing momentum for further strength,"" Kuptsikevich said, explaining his bearish take.  The probability of short-term BTC price weakness will likely increase if the U.S. July consumer price index data, due for release Wednesday, shows sticker inflation, dashing hopes for Fed rate cuts in the coming months.  Bitcoin bounced to levels above $60,000 late last week, retracing over 50% of the slide seen in the five days to Aug. 5.

32361020,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635099,1723546820,Cardano Is Not ‘Dead’: Crypto Analyst Predicts Surge To $5,"According to the analysts on the Discover Crypto YouTube channel (with 1.4 million subscribers), Cardano might surge to $5. This prediction starkly contrasts with the pessimistic views currently circulating within the broader cryptocurrency community, challenging recent headlines that have questioned ADA’s future viability. Why Cardano Could Hit $5 The analyst first addressed the negative sentiment surrounding Cardano, pointing out a series of bearish headlines from various crypto news outlets. He highlighted the contradiction between the public perception of Cardano as a “dead coin”t and the ongoing vigorous development activities within the Cardano ecosystem. “Despite what the mainstream media is portraying, the development activity on Cardano has been robust, ranking third among all cryptocurrencies,” the analyst asserted. This was further emphasized by recent data showing that developers continue to build and refine the platform, indicating a healthy and active development environment. Related Reading: Cardano Eyes $0.3389: Can Bulls Sustain ADA Above This Critical Level? Focusing on the forthcoming Chang hard fork, the analyst described this event as a pivotal moment for Cardano. “The Chang hard fork represents the most significant milestone in Cardano’s history,” he noted. He added, “Maybe articles are out there trying to suppress the price right before the price goes parabolic and just rallies to the upside potentially even $5 this cycle.” From a technical analysis standpoint, the analyst introduced the “breaker block pattern,” a less common but noteworthy technical chart pattern often used by traders. The breaker block pattern occurs when a corrective price block is fully retraced after a strong directional market move. This pattern is considered bullish as it typically indicates that after a period of price consolidation or correction, the original bullish trend has regained strength and is likely to continue. “We’re observing a classic breaker block formation in ADA’s chart, which historically precedes significant price rallies,” explained the analyst. Related Reading: Cardano Price Crash Below $0.3: Is It Time For You To Buy ADA? Coupled with this pattern, the analyst pointed to a promising stochastic RSI crossover on the monthly chart—a technical indicator often used to predict changes in momentum. “The stochastic RSI is about to cross, and this is a very bullish sign historically. When this blue line passes the orange line, it sets up previous rallies, which we can clearly observe if we look back at the charts,” explained the analyst. The discussion also extended to market dynamics, specifically the order book data for ADA, which showed a predominance of buy orders over sell orders. “A glance at the order book reveals a significant inclination towards buying rather than selling, suggesting a strong market consensus leaning towards a bullish trajectory for ADA,” he commented. In conclusion, the analyst urged viewers to look beyond the negative headlines and focus on the substantial foundational improvements and strong technical indicators that support a bullish outlook for Cardano. “Ignore the detractors and the negative press. The data, the developments, and the technical indicators all align to suggest that ADA is poised for a significant upward movement, potentially reaching as high as $5 in this cycle,” he concluded. At press time, ADA traded at $0.3379.

42417451,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYVYb,1723545712,"Hamster Kombat Says It Skipped VC Fund Offers, Bashes 'Exit Liquidity' Behavior","Hamster Kombat, a viral play-to-earn crypto game, criticized venture capital funding as an ""exit liquidity"" activity and turned down all investment offers.  Developers said they hope to ""return to the fundamentals of the web3 space,"" by focusing on creating innovative projects that generate real value and revenue rather than using their audience for funding.  Hamster Kombat has gained significant popularity with a claimed 200 million users as of July and 53 million subscribers on its Telegram channel  Viral play-to-earn crypto game Hamster Kombat criticized crypto venture capital funding as an “exit liquidity” activity in a Tuesday broadcast to community members – stating it has turned down every offer.  “Since our explosive growth began, we’ve received numerous investment offers from some of the biggest venture capital firms in the Web3 space,” the game’s admins said in its official Telegram group. “We’ve turned down every single one.”  “Too many Web3 projects have built audiences only to use them as exit liquidity for their venture capital backers. This has, unfortunately, become the norm in the industry,” they said.  “We stand against this practice. We want the web3 space to return to its fundamentals.”  “Instead of creating innovative projects that generate real value and revenue, companies often focus on making a convincing pitch to secure funding, spend it on marketing, conduct an airdrop or even a public ICO, and then walk away—leaving users holding the bag.”  Hamster Kombat allows its gamers to become the virtual hamster CEO of a crypto exchange of their choice, such as Binance, OKX, and others, on its platform. Players tap the hamster on the screen to start earning some points that can be used to acquire upgrades for their in-game exchange.  The game uses the TON blockchain and claims to have 200 million users as of July. Players can convert their in-game coins into HMSTR tokens which are tradable on cryptocurrency exchanges. The game has gained significant popularity since its April release – with 53 million subscribers on its Telegram channel.  The only way to obtain the future HMSTR token is by playing the game. Some 60% of the total supply is reserved for the players, with the rest reserved for providing market liquidity, future ecosystem partnerships and grants, rewarding squads, and other items.  Why is VC funding getting a bad rep?  In recent months, crypto venture firms have been criticized by parts of the crypto industry, with a specific focus on investing in projects whose tokens eventually have a higher valuation than the venture firm’s initial investments.  This tends to create downward pressure after exchange listings and leaves public investors with losses.  As CoinDesk previously reported, newer tokens such as Aptos’ APT and Sui Network’s SUI have fallen as much as 70% since their 2023 peaks, while bitcoin (BTC) kept rising and made new highs in 2024.  ""Venture capital funds invested $13 billion in Q1 2022, while the market turned into a steep bear market,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in a June report. ""Those funds are now under pressure from their investors to return capital as artificial intelligence (AI) has become a hotter theme.""  Crypto funding took a hit in 2023 but has recorded growth past three quarters, as per a PitchBook report on August 9. Deal value hit $2.7 billion in Q2, marking a 2.5% increase in total invested capital but a 12.5% decline in the number of deals compared to Q1.  As for Hamster Kombat’s future HMSTR token, developers say venture funds will access the token in the same way that users would: by buying it on exchanges after it is eventually issued and listed.

32359457,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635087,1723543238,$3 Million PEPE Gamble Sparks Speculation Of Incoming Price Surge,"Within the past week, an aggressive accumulation of 420 billion PEPE tokens in two transactions worth 3.13 million USDT has been made by a crypto whale identified as “cookislandstrust.eth”. This strategic move, starting at the height of the market dip on August 5, has returned a profit of $170,000—equating to a 5.5% gain. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Gains Strength, Outpaces Bitcoin With An 8% Surge Whale’s Big Appetite However, the whale’s action did not stop at PEPE. The same day, they bought nearly 3,000 Ether against 7.05 million USDT during the market slump for an unrealized profit of $534,000, up 7.58%. This double investment in wildly fluctuating PEPE and more stable Ethereum reveals how this whale precisely calculated its actions to generate the most from turbulent market situations. A whale named “cookislandstrust.eth” is trying to buy $PEPE at dip again! In the past 7 days, the whale has spent a total of 3.13M $USDT to buy 420B $PEPE on 2 occasions, including the big dump on Aug 5 and 2 hours ago, now making $170K (+5.4%). The whale also spent 7.05M $USDT… pic.twitter.com/QVnbW5AGYz — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) August 12, 2024 Obviously, this big whale regards Ethereum as some form of fortress, especially when turmoil occurs within the markets. The move reflects a far greater sentiment the big guys have: Ethereum remains a safe bet, especially when quakes are experienced in the market. Now, this really shows how calculated this whole shift into various volatile and stable assets was on the part of that whale. Pepe: Market Response And Investor Sentiment “Cookislandstrust.eth” loves aggressive buying and has got the whole crypto community talking. Normally, when whales start to go upon bulk buying, people take it as a bullish signal. It simply denotes the fact that these big-time investors are of the view that the prices will go up in the future. Now, more than ever, it’s in the hands of the traders and market lovers to critically follow the price of PEPE in order to see whether this will be just the tip of the iceberg. Will the whale’s confidence start a larger trend of accumulation? Analyst Weighs In PEPE’s performance in the recent past has been nothing close to stable. The meme coin is quite volatile in its price swings, classifying it as one of the riskiest investments one can make. Yet it cautions some of the biggest investors, who buy into the hype or speculation. Well, just recently, Crypto Titans, a pseudonymous analyst, shared that PEPE could be set for a significant price move. The analyst noted that this formed a bullish pennant on the daily chart, therefore suggesting an extension of the uptrend. More so, a bullish flag pattern was further spotted on the 4-hour chart to indicate continuity of the momentum. Crypto Titans believe that if PEPE breaks out from both patterns, its price could dramatically skyrocket to $0.00000888 for a 100% increase from its current level. He also warned, though, that it could potentially mean a retest of lower support levels if this upper trend line doesn’t break, adding a level of uncertainty to the forecast. The actions of the whale mean that profits could pay off big, but they also show the risks involved in timing the market. Related Reading: Is Now the Time to Buy Bitcoin? Top Analysts Predict $150K Surge On The Horizon In a market downturn, analyst like cookislandstrust.eth will let you know what the sentiment is. While, certainly very risky, these tremendous buys that this whale made in PEPE and Ethereum do make a case for fast trades. That is the issue with the high volatility of crypto: what works for one whale doesn’t necessarily fit with what works for normal investors. Crypto Titans, on the other hand, remains optimistic about gains that PEPE would attain if certain patterns do materialize, but advises a degree of prudence. In this crypto market, the timing and the analysis are very essential but not sufficient. One has to be very cautious and do their own research because the strategies may not work out with everyone.

32357930,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635062,1723539631,"Ethereum Targets $3,000 After Market Shakeout, CryptoQuant Sees Impulsive Bull Run Ahead","After enduring a significant downturn at the beginning of the past week, Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, has staged a modest recovery, reclaiming the crucial $2,600 level and setting its sights on the $3,000 milestone once again. The August 5 crash, which saw Ethereum’s price plummet to $2,112, marked the year’s largest market slump. However, the digital asset has since bounced back, 8% in the last seven days, hinting at the possibility of a more sustained bullish trend. Massive Ethereum Liquidations Trigger Bullish Signals According to a recent report by market analytics firm CryptoQuant on the ETH’s price action, the chart below highlights a substantial liquidation of long perpetual positions on the futures market experienced during last week’s crash. The firm notes that in sustained bull markets, such a significant liquidation event is often followed by a major price rally as the futures market stabilizes and spot buying pressure takes over. Related Reading: Legendary Fibonacci Extension Reveals When Bitcoin Will Reach $109,000 “The recent cascade has triggered massive long liquidations, reaching levels not seen since November 2022,” the firm noted. “This substantial liquidation likely indicates a cooling of the futures market, where many leveraged positions have been flushed out. Such a development can set the stage for renewed interest in the futures market.” With the futures market potentially resetting, CryptoQuant believes that if demand returns, Ethereum could be poised for another impulsive bullish surge in the longer term that could send prices above previous all-time high levels. ETH’s Price Path To $3,000 Crypto analyst Caleb Franzen echoed a similar prediction for ETH’s price in a social media post on the X platform (formerly Twitter), suggesting that if Ethereum can take out the $2,725 level, it could signal a strong move higher. Franzen’s analysis of the 4-hour candles and market structure indicates a series of higher lows and a bullish reading on the supertrend indicators, further fueling the optimism surrounding Ethereum’s future performance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Again Show Extreme Fear As BTC Slips To $59,000 However, with ETH currently trading at $2,645, the first resistance on the ETH/USDT weekly chart, located at the $2,700 level, has proven to be the first hurdle for the second-largest cryptocurrency to overcome in recent days. In a scenario where the current rally extends into the coming weeks and the ETH price tackles the level highlighted by Franzen, the $2,900 and $2,990 resistance walls would be the last obstacles to reclaim the $3,000 level. Conversely, the token will need to secure and consolidate above the $2,550 level to prevent further declines toward the next support on the daily chart, currently located at the $2,345 level following its 25% correction.

Supply of the top two stablecoins, USDT and USDC, continues to rise.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} has quickly recovered to nearly $60,000 after a debacle last week that saw prices drop below $50,000 at one point.  The recovery may have legs, as the ""exchange stablecoins ratio,"" which measures the number of BTC held in wallets tied to centralized exchanges relative to stablecoins, suggests reduced selling pressure.  The ratio has dropped to its lowest since February 2023, extending a prolonged downtrend that began in June last year, according to data tracked by blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant.  ""This could indicate reduced selling pressure on bitcoin as fewer traders are converting their BTC into stablecoins,"" CryptoQuant told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  ""Additionally, this could suggest a bullish market sentiment, where traders seem to be holding BTC in anticipation of future price increases,"" CryptoQuant added.  Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies with values pegged to an external reference such as the U.S. dollar. These digital assets help investors bypass price volatility associated with other tokens and are widely used to fund spot crypto purchases and derivatives trading.  According to charting platform TradingView, the combined supply of the top two stablecoins by market value, tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), has increased by roughly $2 billion to $150.15 billion since the Aug. 5 market crash. On a year-to-year basis, the combined supply of USDT and USDC has increased by almost 30%.  It shows continued fiat inflow into the market, possibly from bargain hunters looking to snap up BTC at cheaper valuations.  The development is consistent with the constructive outlook offered by some analysts.  ""Spot ETFs saw positive net flows on Monday. BTC (+$28M) and ETH(+$5M) saw institutional support after the weekend dip. This shows a certain resilience during times of fear, potentially helping Bitcoin’s volatility to decrease over the long term. Yesterday, the $58,500 level we mentioned held strongly and Bitcoin pushed above $60,500 before coming back to $59,500,"" Valentin Fournier, analyst at digital assets research firm BRN, told CoinDeks in an email.

During the last few retraces, a whale bought over 400 billion PEPE, already registering unrealized profits from its purchase. Some market watchers believe the token is poised to lead the “memeseason” after its recent performance. Related Reading: USTC Preps For Explosive 360% Run, Crypto Analyst Reveals When Whale Goes On Buying Spree A week ago, the crypto market saw a significant slump, with most cryptocurrency prices nosediving by over 20%. Bitcoin (BTC) saw its price fall from the $59,000 mark to as low as $49,000 last Monday. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, retraced 24% after its price dropped below the $2,200 support zone. PEPE, one of the leading memecoins, also saw a price decline of over 28%, which fueled a negative sentiment among some crypto investors. After the memecoin recovered over the week, a whale decided to take profit from the frog-themed token. On-chain data analysis firm Lookonchain revealed that a whale had sold its 795.92 billion PEPE since August 1. The address, which withdrew its holdings from Binance on March 1, sent 400 billion tokens, worth around $4.2 million, back to the crypto exchange. The whale saw a return on investment (ROI) of 230%, according to Lookonchain. On Friday, the address deposited its remaining 3945.92 PEPE on Binance, making a total profit of $5.06 million. However, not all investors decided to sell, as one address took the opportunity to buy the dip. According to SpotOnChain, a whale named “cookislandstrust.eth” loaded its bags during the August 5 and August 12 retraces. Per the post, the whale purchased 300 billion PEPE a week ago and another 120 billion tokens today. In the last week, the address spent 3.13 million USDT to buy the 420 billion tokens at an average price of $0.000007455. At the time of the report, the investor had made over $170,000 (+5.43%) in unrealized profits. Additionally, the same address bought 2,978 ETH, worth around $7.05 million, on August 5, making over half a million in unrealized gains. PEPE Recovers 10% From Monday’s Dip In the late hours of Sunday, the token saw its price drop from the $0.000008 level to the $0.0000076 mark, a 12% decline from the day prior. Following the buying spree, PEPE’s price saw a 10% surge from the market shakeout, reclaiming the $0.000008 support zone. The recovery saw the token retest the $0.0000084 price range before retracing to the $0.0000082 level. This performance represents a 2.1% increase in the last 24 hours and a 36% surge in the weekly timeframe. As of this writing, the third-largest memecoin by market cap is trading at $0.00000823. According to the pseudonym crypto trader Trade4ddict, PEPE has been “holding well again compared to most alts,” despite today’s dip. To him, the frog-themed memecoin “confirmed a breakout of 4 days price range” on Friday, which completed the bull setup. The trader considers the token is “gaining strength again” after the latest “little correction.” This suggests to him that the “next step is a breakout of the descending broadening wedge.” Per the post, a breakout could lead to a run that would retest key resistance levels and propel the price to a new all-time high (ATH).

They allege TerraForm induced 3AC to purchase Luna and TerraUSD by manipulating the market for these tokens.  Defunct cryptocurrency hedge fund Three Arrows Capital's (3AC) liquidators have sued Terraform Labs for $1.3 billion, for losses the fund suffered after the 2022 crash, Bloomberg reported on Monday.  In June 2023, the liquidators sought $1.3 billion from the founders of 3AC, Su Zhu and Kyle Davies.  The saga started unfolding in May 2022, when the Terra network saw its algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST) and its companion token, LUNA, suffer a $40 billion collapse despite assurances from co-founder Do Kwon. By July, 3AC filed for bankruptcy stating that Terra's collapse caused irrecoverable losses.  This case alleges that TerraForm induced 3AC to purchase Luna and TerraUSD by manipulating the market for these tokens “in a manner that artificially inflated the price for the assets” before they were wiped-out, the liquidators said in court papers, as per Bloomberg.  Terraform filed for bankruptcy in Delaware, U.S. in January 2024. Do Kwon was found guilty by a Manhattan jury on civil fraud charges brought the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in April 2024.  Do Kwon remains in Montenegro where he has been since his arrest in March 2023 for attempting to use fake travel documents. He awaits a final decision from Montenegro's authorities on where he is to be extradited. Both South Korean and U.S. authorities have been seeking his extradition.

Ethereum Holders In Profit Still At Relatively Low Level According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the recent downturn in Ethereum has significantly affected the profitability ratio of holders on the network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Again Show Extreme Fear As BTC Slips To $59,000 In the drawdown, the ETH price had slipped from the $3,400 high near the end of July to the $2,100 level about a week ago. Since then, though, the coin has seen a sharp rebound to above the $2,700 mark. The recovery should mean that some investors lost due to the crash would be back in profits now. Still, as IntoTheBlock notes, only 66% of the holders are currently carrying gains, implying that the profitability ratio is yet to see a notable improvement. The analytics firm has shared a chart showing how the price ranges near the current one regarding the number of investors who bought at them. In the graph, the size of the dot correlates to the number of holders whose cost basis is between the corresponding price range. It would appear that many investors bought between the $2,920 to $3,000 and 3,000 to $3,080 ranges. Naturally, these investors would lose right now due to the asset’s spot price being below these ranges. Some holders like these who are at a loss look forward to the asset rising back to their cost basis to exit the market and get their money back. Such selling can provide resistance to the coin. This selling is usually not of a scale that can impede Ethereum. Still, when many investors share their cost basis inside the same narrow range, the chances of a significant selloff rise. Thus, the aforementioned price ranges can obstruct ETH’s recovery should it proceed that far. Another risk to any rally is profit-taking, but as just 66% of the investors are in profits right now, the risk of a selloff happening with this motive may not be high, especially given that the coin may have already washed out a lot of weak hands during the crash.

DOGE is correcting gains and might find bids near the $0.1032 level. DOGE price is facing hurdles near the $0.1100 pivot zone. The price is trading near the $0.1040 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $0.1032 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start a fresh increase above the $0.1065 resistance zone. Dogecoin Price Holds Key Support In the past few sessions, Dogecoin price saw a decent increase above $0.100 like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price was able to clear the $0.1032 and $0.1050 resistance levels. The bulls even pushed it above $0.1080 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. A high was formed at $0.1090 and the price is now correcting gains. The price declined below the $0.1060 level. There was a drop below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1000 swing low to the $0.1090 high. Dogecoin is now trading near the $0.1040 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Besides, there is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $0.1032 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. The trend line is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1000 swing low to the $0.1090 high. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.1065 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.1080 level. A close above the $0.1080 resistance might send the price toward the $0.1100 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.1120 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.1150. More Downsides In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to recover above the $0.1065 level, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1032 level. The next major support is near the $0.1020 level. The main support sits at $0.1000. If there is a downside break below the $0.1000 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.0900 level or even $0.0880 in the near term.

Top Analysts Predict $150K Surge On The Horizon,"Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap appears to have “bottomed out” and is now poised to surge above $150,000, according to prominent crypto analyst Captain Faibik. This insight from the analyst comes as Bitcoin currently sees a sign of rebound, reclaiming the $60,000 mark following its recent plunge below $59,000. Related Reading: Legendary Fibonacci Extension Reveals When Bitcoin Will Reach $109,000 A $150,000 Surge On The Horizon In his recent post on X, Captain Faibik disclosed a distinct pattern known as the Descending Broadening Wedge found on the BTC chart. This technical pattern typically indicates bullish potential, suggesting that an upward breakout is highly probable after a period of price declines and increasing volatility. Faibik elaborates that we are currently in what he describes as the “Accumulation phase,” which historically precedes significant bullish rallies. This phase is characterized by investors purchasing the asset at lower prices, gearing up for anticipated future gains. The sentiment is supported by the severe price drops in altcoins, with a 60-70% decline since March 2024. Since the March 2024 high, the Markets have been moving in a Descending Broadening Wedge Pattern. We are currently in the Accumulation phase, just before the Next Massive Bullish Rally.

He recalls the period around August-September 2023 when BTC traded between $17,000 and $18,000. According to Faibik, those who heeded his advice to buy during that time saw Bitcoin’s value soar to $74,000. Revealing the current outlook, Faibik noted: Now, I’m telling you again to Accumulate. Bitcoin will likely surpass $150k this time. Keep accumulating the dips and Building your Portfolio for the 2024-25 bullrun. Bitcoin Rainbow Chart Outlook Echoing Fabric’s analysis, another analyst, Lark Davis, points to the Bitcoin Rainbow chart, which currently shows Bitcoin in the “accumulation zone.” Based on historical data, investors use this tool to gauge market sentiment and potential price movements. According to Davis, if BTC reaches the “FOMO Intensifies” zone, as it did in the last cycle, it could skyrocket to between $150,000 and $190,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Trims Gains: Is the Rally Losing Steam?

32349654,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634978,1723519854,"BTC’s Next Objective? Analyst Eyes Crucial $70,000 Resistance Zone For Bitcoin","After a roller coaster ride in the market last week, Bitcoin shows endurance, bouncing back from the recent dip to $49,000 and reclaiming the $60,000 milestone as key to its continuation to the upside to regain levels lost during the last 20% correction on August 5. Despite facing hurdles, the largest cryptocurrency on the market continues to exhibit signs of sustaining the macro uptrend that has been prevalent since the start of the year. ‘Golden Buying Opportunities’ In a recent analysis highlighting Bitcoin’s price action and technical outlook, crypto analyst Doctor Profit shared insights that reveal market sentiment following the recent tumultuous trading week. Doctor Profit noted that major players like BlackRock and Fidelity showed confidence by maintaining their positions in the Bitcoin ETF market and adding more BTC to their portfolios. This sentiment was further echoed by the steady and healthy inflows and outflows observed in ETF activities, showcasing a lack of extreme reactions from investors despite the correction experienced last week. Related Reading: XRP Price Reaches Support: Will It Trigger a Turnaround? Another key point of focus in Doctor Profit’s analysis was the behavior of whales in the market. These holders accumulated 400,000 BTC within 30 days, equivalent to 2% of the total Bitcoin supply. Notably, these entities capitalized on the market dip, showcasing a “smart money” approach by strategically adding to their positions during the Monday drop. Regarding price action and technical analysis, Doctor Profit emphasized the importance of understanding the market range within which Bitcoin oscillates throughout the year. The analyst asserted that dips between $60,000 and $50,000 present “golden buying opportunities,” with each descent below the bottom of the range signifying a chance to accumulate assets at favorable prices. Bitcoin Price Forecast Looking ahead, Doctor Profit continues to believe that the $69,000-$70,000 diagonal resistance is the primary target for Bitcoin. Despite the potential challenges posed by the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) and 200-day moving average (MA) resistances between $60,000 and $62,000, respectively, the analyst expresses confidence in overcoming these hurdles soon. However, the analyst also stated that a possible brief pullback to the $54,000-$55,000 area is seen as a temporary setback that could weed out weaker hands from the market. Related Reading: USTC Preps For Explosive 360% Run, Crypto Analyst Reveals When This week is also poised to bring heightened market activity, with pivotal economic data releases such as the producer price index (PPI) and consumer price index (CPI) numbers expected to inject volatility into the market. According to Doctor Profit’s analysis, these developments could set the stage for significant movements and potentially influence the direction of future interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve in September. Doctor Profit believes the inflation data may exceed expectations, potentially paving the way for rate adjustments at the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. At the time of writing, BTC has briefly lost the $60,000 mark, falling over 1% in the last 24 hours to a current trading price of $59,450.

32349007,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635070,1723518363,Bitcoin Price Eyes Upside Break: Is a Bullish Move Ahead?,"Bitcoin price stayed above the $57,650 support zone. BTC is now rising and might aim for a move above the $60,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin started a recovery wave above the $58,500 resistance zone. The price is trading below $60,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $60,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might attempt a fresh increase if it settles above the $60,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Eyes Another Increase Bitcoin price started a downside correction below the $60,000 level. BTC declined below the $59,500 and $58,000 levels to move into a short-term bearish zone. A low was formed at $57,690 and the price recently started a recovery wave. There was a move above the $58,000 and $58,500 levels. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $61,800 swing high to the $57,690 swing low. Bitcoin price is now trading below $60,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $60,000 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $60,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The first key resistance is near the $60,250 level. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $61,800 swing high to the $57,690 swing low. A clear move above the $60,250 resistance might send the price further higher in the coming sessions. The next key resistance could be $61,200. The next major hurdle sits at $62,500. A close above the $62,500 resistance might spark more upsides. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $64,200 resistance. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $60,000 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $58,800 level. The first major support is $57,650. The next support is now near the $57,000 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $55,500 support zone or even $55,000 in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $58,500, followed by $57,650.

Crypto was not mentioned during the two-hour long event.  Former President Donald Trump did not mention bitcoin {{BTC}} or crypto during an interview with X CEO Elon Musk on Monday evening.  Over two hours, the wide-ranging interview covered a variety of topics including illegal immigration, the economy, AI and global warming.  The interview attracted over 1 million listeners and was delayed for over 45 mins, due to what Musk called a ""massive [distributed denial of service] attack on X"".  “As this massive attack illustrates, there’s a lot of opposition to people just hearing what President Trump has to say,” Musk said of the alleged attack.  A report from The Verge called this into question, however, with a source telling the publication that this wasn't the case, saying there was a ""99 percent chance Musk was lying"" about the attack. An alert from cybersecurity watchdog organization Netblocks said X Spaces was experiencing international outages but did not confirm if it was a DDOS attack.

The prediction market also added another market to ask bettors about the possibility of ""bitcoin"" being mentioned, which peaked at 69% with approximately $330,000 on the table.  Each share pays out $1 in USDC, a stablecoin, or cryptocurrency that trades at par with the U.S. dollar, if the prediction comes true, and zero if not.  Polymarket did not list out markets for mentions of other digital assets such as ether, solana, or dogecoin.  Bettors had punted over $250,000 on Trump mentioning ""Tesla,"" which peaked at 79%, however Trump dodged the specific word by referring to the electric vehicle brand from Musk as ""your cars.""  Other words that bettors had punted on, which Trump ended up saying on X space, included ""MAGA,"" ""illegal immigrant,"" and ""tampon.""  One user by the name of 'bama1234' walked away with just over $1 million for betting correctly on most of the words Trump did or did not say during the interview.  Of all the words, their largest stake was in Trump not saying ""crypto"", which led him to cash out $336,918.  The user did not correctly bet on Trump saying ""MAGA"" during the interview, which Trump said early on, or ""Trans,"" which the user thought Trump would say, but the Republican candidate did not in the end.

While traders are waiting for a conclusive close above $63,000, confirming bulls of the second half of last week, on-chain data points to risk and traders staying on the sidelines. Traders Cautious: Will The Bitcoin Consolidation Continue? Taking to X, one on-chain analyst said. However, traders are bullish and expecting immediate price expansion; key metrics show that most are more cautious, meaning the uptrend might be delayed. Related Reading: Optimism Suffers 21% Loss – Will On-Chain Activity Regain Investor Trust? One key indicator, the Bitcoin Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR), a dynamic ratio between the Bitcoin open interest in futures exchanges and the Bitcoin exchange reserves across leading platforms like Binance and Exchange, has been decreasing, recently falling by 1.5%. Usually, whenever the Bitcoin ELR falls, traders are more confident, meaning traders are more risk-on and unwilling to gain more exposure via leveraged positions. While open interest and ELR are falling, the analyst notes that funding rates across leveraged futures platforms remain neutral. This shows that the broader market is balanced. Most importantly, active traders are cautious, adopting a wait-and-see approach, and are mainly hesitant. This state of affairs, the analyst said, could persist until the end of the month as traders wait for clear signals before diving in. Miner Reserve Falling, USDT And USDC Inflow Spikes: Will BTC Rise? The continuous drop in the Bitcoin Miner Reserve is added to this current state of affairs. The decrease comes when miners have been actively selling after the Halving event on April 20. Related Reading: Toncoin Rally Thwarted As TON Slips To $6, Can Bulls Prevent A Bearish Breakdown? As revenue fell due to the halving of miner rewards, weak miners sold to stay afloat. Bitcoin prices tanked by nearly 20% throughout June amid a wave of miner liquidation. It remains to be seen whether prices will bounce higher. However, as long as miners hold fewer coins, supply constraints exist. This development may increase prices if institutions demand more coins via spot Bitcoin ETFs. As prices flatline, there is hope. Over the past few weeks, there have been massive inflows of stablecoins across leading exchanges, averaging $53 billion per day. Demand could be reinvigorated as more USDT and USDC flow into Binance and other competitors. Subsequently, this may spark another wave of higher highs above crucial resistance levels in the coming days and weeks.

Bitcoin Set To Hit $72,000 In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, a crypto analyst identified as ‘Sensei’ has predicted that Bitcoin will surge to $72,000 soon. The analyst shared a price chart highlighting two parallel trend lines that trace Bitcoin’s recent price movements. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Price Will Surge 2,500% To $2.55, Here’s When The analyst rooted his optimistic projections in the potential for a bullish surge in Bitcoin following the recent market bear trap. Given Bitcoin’s earlier crash of over 20%, many analysts, including Sensei, have speculated that this sharp drop might actually be a bear trap. The crypto analyst indicated in another X post that Bitcoin was moving past this supposed bear trap, suggesting that the cryptocurrency could reach the $72,000 target once the bear trap concludes. Furthermore, Sensei disclosed that Bitcoin was 24% from reaching a new all time high this bullish cycle. This implies that the pioneer cryptocurrency was on the path to surpass its March’s all time high which saw its price skyrocketing by more than $73,000. In his daily posts on X, the analyst shows unwavering support for Bitcoin, persistently urging investors to HODL their cryptocurrencies in preparation for a potential bullish surge. He predicts that the biggest bull run will start following Bitcoin’s breakout between the price of $70,000 and $78,000. Additionally, he has provided a potential timeline for this substantial bull run, forecasting that the Bitcoin bull run might commence by the end of August 2024. While $72,000 may be a short term price target for Bitcoin, Sensei remains highly bullish on the cryptocurrency’s long term future outlook, anticipating a substantial rise to $150,000. Despite hopes of a price recovery and subsequent bullish rally, Bitcoin has dropped below $60,000, according to CoinMarketCap. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $58,773, recording a significant 4.11% decrease in the last 24 hours. Analysts Stay Positive On BTC’s Future Outlook In the face of price declines and large-scale market liquidations, analysts maintain a positive outlook for Bitcoin’s price, predicting massive uptrends once the market downturn subsides. Related Reading: Ethereum Vs. Solana: Legendary Trader Peter Brandt Reveals The ‘Clear Winner’ Popular crypto analyst, Michael van de Poppe expects Bitcoin to experience a major bullish breakout following a period of consolidation.

Sharing a similar sentiment, a crypto analyst identified as ‘Milkybull Crypto’ noted that Bitcoin’s price was gaining strength following its higher low on a 3-day chart. The analyst has projected that the cryptocurrency is poised to witness a short term price consolidation before experiencing an upward movement.
