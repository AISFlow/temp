42423816,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2gyXh,1643153821,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Nears $37K Amid Lighter Trading,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin led a broader market stabilization with reduced spot trading volume.  Technician's take: A decisive break above $40K BTC is needed to pause the downtrend from November.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $36,971 +1%  Ether (ETH): $2,460 +1.3%  Top gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Dogecoin DOGE +2.6% Currency Polygon MATIC +1.0% Smart Contract Platform Polkadot DOT +0.8% Smart Contract Platform  Top losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Internet Computer ICP −5.2% Computing Cardano ADA −4.0% Smart Contract Platform Algorand ALGO −3.8% Smart Contract Platform  Sector classifications are provided via the Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS), developed by CoinDesk Indices to provide a reliable, comprehensive, and standardized classification system for digital assets. The CoinDesk 20 is a ranking of the largest digital assets by volume on trusted exchanges.  Markets  S&P 500: 4,356 -1.2%  DJIA: 34,297 -0.1%  Nasdaq: 13,539 -2.2%  Gold: $1,848 +-0.2%  Market moves  Bitcoin led a broad stabilization in the crypto market Tuesday, as its spot trading volume came down dramatically from a day ago.  At the time of publication, the oldest cryptocurrency was changing hands near $37,000, up slightly over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data. Ether, the second biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading above $2,400, also up slightly over the same period.  Data compiled by CoinDesk shows that bitcoin’s spot trading volume across major crypto exchanges came down significantly on Tuesday, after a volatile trading day on Monday.  “We are starting to see flashes of [the] demand from players who recognize the longer-term value proposition of crypto,” Joel Kruger, currency strategist at LMAX Digital, told CoinDesk.  Norway-based blockchain data analytics firm Arcane Research noted in its weekly update on Tuesday that bitcoin’s price saw a “substantial recovery” with a volume spike on crypto exchange Coinbase during the late U.S. trading session on Monday, raising a question of whether MicroStrategy or some other unknown entities may have lifted the entire market by bidding up bitcoin’s price on Coinbase.  That said, the crypto market is closely observing the result of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. The Fed on Wednesday is expected to hint at an interest rate hike in March to fight inflation.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Rose Above $37K; Resistance at $40K-$43K  Bitcoin buyers remained active, after pushing the cryptocurrency to over $37,000, which is near the top of a weeklong price range. Still, upside could be limited at the $40,000-$43,000 resistance zone over the short term.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the four-hour chart triggered an oversold signal on Saturday, which preceded the latest price bounce. On the daily chart, the RSI is starting to rise from extreme oversold levels, which could stabilize the current sell-off.  Initial resistance is at the 100-period moving average on the four-hour chart, positioned at $40,600. Buyers will need to make a decisive move above that level to pause the downtrend from November.

It was as a result of market sell-offs across the financial space, sparking a ripple effect that was felt heavily in the crypto market. Market sentiment had crumbled during this time as investors had scrambled to sell their holdings. However, not everyone saw the declining prices as a signal to sell before prices tank even more. Whales, who control a large portion of the circulating supply, took this as a cue to buy and have been filling their bags with all of the bitcoin being dumped on the market by panicking investors.

It&apos;s almost as if they&apos;re mirroring each other&apos;s moves. Bitcoin shot back up above $36,000 Tuesday morning after a day of heavy trading that saw the price drop below 33K for the first time since July 2021.

In order for bulls to have a chance at a climb back to previous highs, VeChain must reclaim the $0.060 level in the short term. Bennett said: It would have to close the day above $0.0650 before it starts to move back to $0.10, $0.12, etcetera. Until that day I think you have to be careful, and you have to realize that the downtrend is still intact.

42423809,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2gyLh,1643147946,New York State Senate Confirms New Top Financial Regulator,"The New York Department of Financial Services officially has a new head.  The state Senate confirmed Adrienne Harris, a former federal official and professor, to run the Wall Street regulator on Tuesday. Harris has been serving as the acting superintendent of NYDFS since her nomination in August.  Harris was a special assistant to the Barack Obama White House on economic policy, as well as a senior adviser to then-Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Sarah Bloom Raskin, who's now a nominee to be vice chairwoman for supervision at the Federal Reserve. Harris was also recently on the board of the Digital Dollar Foundation, an advocacy group that was founded by former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Christopher Giancarlo and former LabCFTC head Daniel Gorfine. LabCFTC is a part of the CFTC responsible for promoting innovation in fintech.  In a statement following her confirmation, Harris thanked New York Gov. Kathy Hochul for her nomination and the Senate for confirming her.  ""I am honored to serve as the Superintendent of the Department of Financial Services. As the first African American woman to lead DFS, I am personally committed to working with all stakeholders to build a robust, fair and sustainable financial system, creating a better economic future for all New Yorkers,"" she said.  During a nomination hearing before the state Senate Finance Committee on Monday, Harris said she hoped to bolster the regulator’s BitLicense team to clear a backlog of applications for New York’s landmark virtual currency license.  “One of the things I have done is undertake a review of that unit and see what’s causing that backlog,” she said in response to a question from state Sen. Diane Savino (D-Staten Island).  Savino also asked if Harris supported a bill that would enable NYDFS to collect assessments from the virtual currency companies it regulates, noting that the entity is not funded by the state. Harris said she would.  “Cryptocurrency is here to stay, but the risk of anti-money laundering, consumers, for cyber are incredibly high, so we need real rigor,” Harris said.  Matt Homer, a former senior official at NYDFS and now an executive-in-residence with Nyca Partners, told CoinDesk her responses during her hearing show “she’s superbly qualified to serve as superintendent.  “She has deep expertise that cuts across the financial services landscape and highly relevant prior experience from the Obama White House and Treasury Department, as well as the private sector,” he said.  Harris said she wants the NYDFS to have more resources to oversee crypto, fintech and financial services at large. Crypto in particular is continually evolving, she said.  “It is quickly evolving. Even though we've had the BitLicense since 2015, it didn’t account for things like stablecoins … there's always more we can do,” Harris said.

42423814,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2gyVh,1643146876,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Little Changed as Analysts Remain Skeptical,"Bitcoin (BTC) rose above $36,000 on Tuesday but was still down about 0.38% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 0.76% fall in ETH. Considering the rebound earlier today, it appears that buyers are starting to return, but some analysts expect choppy price action ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's press conference on Wednesday. Fed officials kicked off their policy meeting today.  The Fed is expected to provide details about ending its asset-purchase program in March, which could coincide with a rate hike. Concerns about a tighter monetary policy have contributed to a sharp sell-off across speculative assets, including equities and cryptocurrencies over the past two weeks.  Some crypto buyers could remain on the sidelines given macroeconomic and regulatory uncertainty. As for regulation, Russia's Ministry of Finance opposed calls for a crypto ban by the nation's central bank. ""We need to regulate, not ban,"" Ivan Chebeskov, head of the financial policy department at Russia's Ministry of Finance, said during a conference on Tuesday.  For now, it appears that short-term traders have returned to the bitcoin spot market. BTC's trading volume has increased over the past few days after the cryptocurrency dropped below $40,000. That could signal higher volatility ahead.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $36679, −0.38%    ●Ether (ETH): $2424, −0.76%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4356, −1.22%    ●Gold: $1848 per troy ounce, +0.35%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 1.78%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Several market indicators such as long BTC liquidations and open interest suggest further downside is likely.  ""The muted liquidations experienced amid the turmoil compared to what we’ve seen earlier might also suggest that underwater longs are exposed for further decline,"" Arcane Research wrote in a Tuesday report.  Bitcoin dominance rises  Another sign of caution is the recent rise in bitcoin's dominance ratio, which is BTC's market capitalization relative to the total crypto market cap. Typically, a rise in the dominance ratio indicates a flight to safety among crypto traders as bitcoin is viewed as less risky than alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins).  Altcoin roundup  Solana and Polkadot lead altcoin gains: Several major cryptocurrencies moved with bitcoin today and rose as high as 12%. Polkadot (DOT), Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) were among the biggest gainers. The broader crypto market added 5% to the $1.76 trillion total market capitalization in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk’s Shaurya Malwa. Read more here.  Ethereum money markets see record liquidations as bitcoin-ether ratio hits three-month high: The bitcoin-ether ratio rallied to its highest level in three months on Monday, signaling continued bitcoin outperformance in the near term, according to Omkar Godbole. Ether’s recent sell-off triggered liquidations of collateral locked in prominent Ethereum-based lending and borrowing protocols such as AAVE, Compound and MakerDAO. MakerDAO alone made more than $15 million in liquidation penalty fees. Read more here.  Fantom transactions surpass Ethereum as users look to farm yields: Transactions on the Fantom blockchain exceeded those of Ethereum for the first time ever on Monday as investors seek new avenues to farm yields and accrue value. In the past 24 hours, more than 1.2 million transactions were processed on the Fantom network. That was slightly higher than Ethereum’s 1.1 million transactions. Read more here.

The OFR is cautioning the public that before using any DeFi-based service, it is important to do the necessary due diligence and understand what DeFi is in order to avoid becoming the victim of a scam.  The state regulatory body warns the DeFi investment market is still new, highly volatile and driven mostly by psychological factors rather than investment fundamentals.  DeFi is one of the fastest-growing sectors of the crypto industry, with $92 billion worth of assets currently locked in peer-to-peer powered protocols – up 196% over the last year, as reported by CoinDesk.  Scams, rug pulls, exploits and fatal code errors are among the biggest risks associated with using DeFi platforms.  The OFR defines DeFi as financial services provided by an algorithm on a blockchain, without the involvement of a traditional financial services company.  “Before getting involved with a company or product in the DeFi market, take reasonable steps to understand the risks of this emerging blockchain-based technology and market,” OFR Commissioner Russell Weigel said in a statement.

42411523,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOjkF,1643140782,Wipe Away Your Tears: Crypto Is About More Than Prices,"Take off that McDonald’s hat, boyo, and return to the screen: Bitcoin is up 10%. Favorite altcoins of day traders ETH, LUNA and ATOM are also up and to the right. The trading lines are green, even if your total investment is in the red. This is not financial advice.  Today’s market bounce, which may or may not be of the dead cat variety, is just another data point in crypto’s historically volatile lifecycle. It’s this volatility that many investors are after when they enter the market, the same volatility that causes so much pain for unprepared, over-leveraged buyers.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Some will look at the past six weeks of crypto market spasms at wonder, “when should I buy in?” Crypto was once a $3 trillion asset class, and even ex-Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein said today this stuff is not going away. Others will declare, “I’m staying away forever, it’s irrational.”  There is likely a middle ground, a sound opinion to hold. I’m not an investment wiz, I’m a reporter who covers fake internet money, but I can say the only appropriate way to invest in crypto is to invest with conviction.  This seems obvious, but crypto’s structural attributes – tokens are unmediated, globally accessible 24/7 buying opportunities – make it so scams often appear to be the more attractive buys. If you could only time the market, you’ll be part of the pump rather than the dump.  So far, we’ve been talking around the idea of FOMO, the fear of missing out. When do you buy in? Should you, could you avoid FOMO forever? It’s the critical mechanism that drives so much of the modern economy – the admixture of desire inculcated by branding, speculation driven by envy and the human urge to have a good time.  There are a lot of hype machines in crypto, and a few projects that exist beyond the spectacle. Ponzinomics are baked into these techno-economic tools: the way to align incentives and attract the right kind of self-interested buyers to build communities. But cutting out the middleman and relying solely on behavioral economic mechanisms means just about all tokens are subject to hyper-capitalistic exploitation. Unfettered markets: a blessing and a curse.  Moreover, as an asset class, crypto lives and dies in almost heroic narrative arcs. When it goes down, it has a tendency to crash and burn. When it goes up, a gaggle of smart-money suits will write Twitter threads about how decentralized tech will disrupt everything from finance to vidya (games).  It’s hard to find the time to think critically about crypto-economics and product-market fit when commentators are so breathless, when the numbers are going gangbusters or driving into the dirt, but you must. You cannot time the markets, and you should know you’re often buying into an adverse environment where early adopters hold more than you could ever afford.  Be smart, read these:  Buying Your First Crypto? 10 Things You Should Know  Compounding and Saving in Bitcoin: The Power of a Dollar Cost Averaging  4 Things to Do in a Crypto Bear Market  Right now, from what I can piece together, the Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank, is pulling the ultimate put on the entire economy. It seems like many retail crypto investors are still holding, but they also haven’t been accumulating for the past couple of months. Whales, those bitcoin holders with at least 1,000 coins, by and large rotated their wealth in stablecoins.  What do you do with that information? It is too much to handle, too much to make sense of, at least for me. I don’t want to throw money into crypto even if it seems like a discount, only for the market to tank, and potentially never recover. But my savings account is also moth-eaten by inflation.  Risk is either volatility’s close cousin or alter ego depending on how you look at it. The term “beta” captures both without assigning a value judgment. Saying crypto is a high-beta asset class threads the needle between its systemic hazards and insane price fluctuations. But buying crypto’s beta could be more than a speculative bet, if you have conviction.  Crypto is not an investment for everyone, and you should never, ever risk more than you can afford to lose. Promise me you won’t. But there are a few projects that I have the misfortune of actually believing in. No crypto will ever, or should ever, be central to the majority of economic activity, but it can present viable solutions to real problems.  Decentralization is a powerful force. Some cryptos could rise to that level and become something akin to modern-day public goods infrastructure, meaning they’re accessible to all and under the sway of influence to none. Investing in crypto, for the long haul, is investing in that idea – that’s its beta. But you don’t actually need to own anything to, one day, hopefully benefit.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/01/25/wipe-away-your-tears-crypto-is-about-more-than-prices,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d24043fe83435525acd37daa9c95f774b1033c2-6000x3750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The recommendation came in a report issued on Tuesday following bilateral discussions with El Salvador about its economy. El Salvador has been in negotiations with the IMF for a $1.3 billion loan.  IMF directors “stressed that there are large risks associated with the use of bitcoin on financial stability, financial integrity and consumer protection, as well as the associated fiscal contingent liabilities,” according to the report.  Directors also “urged the authorities to narrow the scope of the Bitcoin Law by removing bitcoin’s legal tender status. Some directors also expressed concern over the risks associated with issuing bitcoin-backed bonds.”  In November, IMF staff said bitcoin should not be used as legal tender in El Salvador and urged the Central American country to strengthen the regulation and supervision of its newly established crypto payment ecosystem.

42423804,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2gyFh,1643138418,"Bitcoin's Correction Continues for Now, but Eventually It Could Go 'Parabolic,' Says Peter Brandt","The recent crypto sell-off could be a mere dip within a long-term uptrend. That’s according to chartist Peter Brandt, CEO of Factor LLC, a research and trading firm.  When asked what it would take for bitcoin (BTC) to get to $200,000, Brandt said, ""I think it's going to take a market that's going to go up on a parabolic basis – and that's what bitcoin has done.""  Bitcoin was trading around $37,000 at press time and is down 45% from its all-time high near $69,000 reached in November 2021. The sharp sell-off accelerated as some traders were forced to liquidate long positions over the past week.  “We haven’t seen the kind of volume expansion that we’ve seen in previous short-term bottoms in bitcoin,” Brandt said during an interview on CoinDesk’s “First Mover” show on Tuesday.  High trading volume on price dips typically signal capitulation among sellers. That means further downside is likely, which could lead to a “wash out below $30,000, and down toward $27,000,” according to Brandt.  “We can get a sellers panic somewhere in the next 30 to 60 days,” Brandt said.  For now, BTC is locked within a tight price range between $33,000 and $42,000 and has been trading in lock step with equities.  “After we’ve seen a 50% decline in bitcoin, now is the time to start recommitting to a long-term narrative,” Brandt said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Damanick Dantes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/25/bitcoins-correction-continues-for-now-but-eventually-it-could-go-parabolic-says-peter-brandt,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/93b594b267f371a14c68bd2f90361c06c17db25d-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The first exec to announce their departure was YouTube’s head of gaming, Ryan Wyatt, who will be joining Polygon as the CEO of Polygon Studios.  “[Wyatt’s] strategy of forging strong relationships with game developers and the creator economy will be critical to Polygon Technology as we continue to scale our support for companies globally to begin their foray into the web3 space,“ Shreyansh Singh, head of Polygon Studios, told CoinDesk through a spokesperson.  Wyatt cited being “fascinated by blockchain app development” as reason for the departure, adding that he is “beyond thrilled to enter the web3 space,” according to the tweet.  Wyatt began his tenure with YouTube’s gaming division in 2014.

After The Crash, Bitcoin NUPL Value Has Declined To 32.5% According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the BTC NUPL&apos;s recent trend may suggest that the early bear market is now beginning. The &apos;Net Unrealized Profit and Loss&apos; (or NUPL in short) is an on-chain indicator that measures the difference between the relative unrealized profit and the relative unrealized loss. NUPL = (Market Cap - Realized Cap) / Market Cap In simpler terms, what this metric tells us is whether the Bitcoin market as a whole is currently in a state of profit or of loss. The indicator works by looking at each coin on the chain and checking whether its current price is lower or higher than the price it was bought at. When the NUPL value is above zero, it means the overall Bitcoin network is currently in profit. On the other hand, negative values imply investors are, on average, in loss at the moment. Historically, the more the indicator has deviated from zero, the closer the price has been to a top or a bottom (depending on which way of zero the metric currently points).

Those bullish price calls for a six-figure BTC price had come from big names including Goldman Sachs, Guggenheim, Pantera and Bloomberg Intelligence.  As late as November, when bitcoin surged to an all-time-high price of $69,000, some traders hoped the $100,000 psychological milestone might be reached in 2021. Now, at the current price of around $36,000, bitcoin would have to nearly triple to hit $100K.  Here's a list of some of the high-profile bitcoin price calls that, if not negated altogether, are moving further into the realm of fantasy.  Dan Morehead, CEO and co-chief investment officer at Pantera Capital, predicted bitcoin would hit $115,000 in the summer of 2021, according to a CoinDesk story in March.  Zach Pandl, Goldman Sachs’ co-head of foreign exchange strategy, predicted bitcoin would increase to just over $100,000 in the next five years, for a compound annualized return of 17%-18%, according to a CoinDesk story earlier this month.  Nayib Bukele, El Salvador's president, who successfully pushed for bitcoin as a national currency, tweeted on Jan. 1 that bitcoin would reach $100,000 in 2022. (Until then, he's been buying the dip in price.)  Samson Mow, chief strategy officer for bitcoin software company Blockstream, told Yahoo Finance in a story published on Jan. 3, ""We will see $100,000 within the first half of the year.""  Marcus Sotiriou, analyst at U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, thought bitcoin would hit $500,000 within five to 10 years, and that it would not surprise him if it hit $100,000 at the end of 2022, according to an Independence story in December.  Jurrien Timmer, Fidelity Investments director of global macro, said bitcoin could reach $100,000 as early as 2023, on the CNBC show ""Squawk on the Street"" in October.  Chris Kline, Bitcoin IRA chief operating officer, said one in three Americans think bitcoin's price would reach $100,000 in 2022, when he appeared on CoinDesk TV on Jan. 5.  Adam Back said in an interview with Anthony Pompliano that after analyzing bitcoin options prices, crossing the $100,000 mark was still “quite possible” in a year, Benzinga reported in August.  Mike McGlone, senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, tweeted in March that bitcoin could reach $100,000 in September. (That did not happen.)  Lennard Neo, a certified financial analyst and head of research at Stack Funds in Singapore, predicted in November 2020 that bitcoin would reach $60,000 to $80,000 by the end of 2021.  Tim Draper, the venture capitalist, predicted bitcoin could hit $250,000 by 2022 or the first quarter of 2023, according to a Bloomberg report in May 2020.  Scott Minerd, the chief investment officer at Guggenheim Investments, predicted in February that bitcoin could reach $600,000.

Related Reading | Bitcoin Supply Shock: Only 12% Of BTC Supply Is On Exchanges Now Bitcoin is moving towards a 1:1 correlation to the U.S. Stock Market, in the short term, according to Bloomberg Intelligence&apos;s Senior Commodity Analyst Mike McGlone. The crypto market has been reacting to the potential shift in the U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy. The financial institution has hinted at an increase in its interest rates to, at least, a 0.25% in 2022&apos;s Q1 and a tapering of their asset purchase. The goal is to stop inflation as the CPI stands at a 40 year high. This has translated into a selloff which begun in Q4, 2021. In addition, investors seem to be trying to get ahead of a potential hike in interest rates, a thesis which could receive confirmation tomorrow during the FED&apos;s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). If the institution hints a tougher shift, Bitcoin could retest its critical support level at $33,000. In expectation of this and other events, investors could be sitting in cash, waiting to bid on BTC when the economic outlook looks clearer. In other words, the demand is low for risk assets and could remain as such for the near future.

42417092,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRycpR,1643130366,Internet Privacy Is an Inalienable Right,"As billions around the world continue to spend more and more of their lives online, making true digital privacy a reality has become imperative. At the same time, because of a series of scandals over the last two or three years, privacy has once again surfaced as a major – and very legitimate – public concern. The rapid emergence of Web 3 provides both a challenge and opportunity.  At first sight, the current reality is anything but encouraging. The entire business model of the “Big Tech” social media companies is built on collecting and selling users’ personal information to advertisers and political groups for the purpose of microtargeting. This information includes not only message content but all the metadata about what we search for or pay for, who we communicate with, when, how often and from where.  David Chaum, a pioneer in cryptography and in privacy-preserving and secure voting technologies, is the creator and founder of the xx network. In 1995, his company, DigiCash, created and deployed eCash, the first digital currency, which used Chaum's breakthrough blind-signature protocol. This post is part of CoinDesk's Privacy Week series.  In other words, Web 2 is essentially founded on the almost complete absence of user privacy and the exploitation of our personal information by huge centralized organizations. Almost as bad, these organizations maintain databases of this and other accumulated information about billions of us, which are breached by cybercriminals with shameful frequency.  To be sure, some social media companies promise or actually deliver end-to-end message encryption. But user metadata is much more valuable to these organizations than the message contents, as shown by the fact that Facebook, for instance, is proposing to offer “end-to-end” message content encryption while leaving user metadata in the clear so the company can continue to harvest and sell it. What’s more, ever-more-powerful artificial intelligence (AI) is already being used to analyze the vast troves of scraped and sold data to both predict and manipulate user behavior. Such manipulation includes the tailoring and dissemination of disinformation for political ends. This dissemination is abetted by social-media algorithms that steer users toward more – and more extreme – sources of related disinformation with the ostensible goal of maintaining and increasing their “engagement.”  Less apparent is that the deep structure of the internet from its origin was never intended to provide privacy. The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which commissioned the development of the TCP/IP message-packet protocol for the internet, explicitly prevented the encryption of packet headers, the digital “label” on each data packet forming part of a message that records source, destination, and transfer addresses.  Some encryption has since been added, but as we have learned from Edward Snowden among others, the National Security Agency (NSA) and other “intelligence” organizations, here and in other countries, easily and routinely gather metadata on internet traffic as part of what they call the “full take.”  We can assume that advanced AI is also being used by these agencies to identify targets for message-content hacking even as (according to Snowden in 2014, backed by The Washington Post) 90% of those placed under surveillance in the U.S. are ordinary Americans, not the supposedly intended terrorist targets, as Snowden disclosed to The Washington Post in 2014.  Finally, when, not if, general-purpose quantum computers of sufficient power are developed, most of the types of encryption individuals currently rely on to preserve what weak, imperfect privacy and security they have will be worthless. That means all messages encrypted today will be readable retroactively.  Combined, this has a depressive effect on both democracy and individual freedom. It has long been established that widespread surveillance chills free speech and discourse. In countries with openly authoritarian governments, surveillance forestalls the emergence of democratic activity. In more democratic societies, the chilling effect extends to the expression of opinions that are outside the centrist “mainstream” of discourse.  This chilling effect extends to corporations. Anyone working for a company these days is well advised to avoid criticizing or complaining about their work environment using their work email, let alone proposing a worker organization like a protest group or a union.  See also: Bitcoin Dissidents: Those Who Need It Most  And even as more and more American states pass laws making it difficult to vote via mail or drop box – and even as the coronavirus pandemic drags on – the possibility of voting via the internet languishes.  What’s to be done?  Having watched this situation develop over four decades, I have come to believe the internet needs to be rebuilt from the ground up. The ground in this case is where the internet began: communications first between local university and laboratory networks and soon thereafter between private individuals. Just people exchanging information and ideas, talking about their lives, doing business and, crucially, discussing social and political issues.  Everyone has an inalienable right to associate privately, and ought to have a right to search for information anonymously. In other words, their personal information should belong to them, and they should be in complete control of it. Period.  This principle should be enshrined in law. There are very powerful vested interests hostile to the principle so it will take a large-scale social movement, online and off, to make informational sovereignty a legal right.  See also: 'Father of Cryptocurrency' David Chaum Discusses Quantum Computing  The good news is that we can start building that foundation now, with existing cryptographic technologies, some of which are novel and others of which date back to the early days of the internet. Broadly, this new technological frontier is called Web 3 – a chance to reframe the web around users rather than corporations.  For Web 3 to achieve its aims, it needs to stand on a proper foundation. We require:  Decentralization: If personal communications are passed between teams of independently owned nodes, selected at random, second by second, from hundreds or thousands around the world working as a network collaborative, there is no centralized company for a government to pressure for user data or to insert spyware. Nodes can instead be organized on a blockchain to allow remuneration for participating in the network.  Elimination of metadata: Messages can be sent in such a way that metadata is destroyed at every node before forwarding to the next. This makes it virtually impossible to identify and link sender and receiver. Senders, however, can at will reveal the identity of receivers.  Quantum-resistant message encryption: As I mentioned, conventional encryption, based on techniques like the factorization of large numbers, is about to be rendered obsolete by quantum computers. Fortunately, quantum-resistant cryptography, whereby reverse-computing the encryption to obtain the message is mathematically infeasible, already exists.  These and related structures and techniques can be extended to existing essential functions of the internet like peer-to-peer payments, web browsing and shopping, and to new functions that we urgently need, like truly secure online voting.

42411532,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOk0m,1643127521,What the Fed Thinks About CDBCs,"A fair amount of news happened last week: The Federal Reserve announced it is still nowhere close to issuing a digital dollar and the U.S. House of Representatives held a surprisingly substantive discussion around crypto's energy impact.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Blockchain bucks  The narrative  The U.S. Federal Reserve finally published its central bank digital currency (CBDC) report! The long-awaited missive outlined the Fed's chief questions about CBDCs and provided a window into its thinking on the issue.  Why it matters  The Fed is finally giving us a good look at how it's approaching CBDCs. What's more, the central bank wants the general public to weigh in.  Breaking it down  So, first off: I’m still not convinced the Fed actually wants to issue a central bank digital currency.  The Fed doesn’t commit one way or another on whether or not it wants to create a CBDC in the report published last week. This is no surprise. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said as much on numerous occasions.  From this view, nothing in the report was really new. The Fed is looking at privacy issues, financial stability concerns, practical applications and whether there really is a need for a digital dollar. Powell has outlined these same questions in various confessional hearings.  In the Fed's view, a hypothetical digital dollar would essentially be a digital analog to the current financial system, with the Fed issuing the currency but intermediaries giving retail users access.  ""The Federal Reserve’s initial analysis suggests that a potential U.S. CBDC, if one were created, would best serve the needs of the United States by being privacy protected, intermediated, widely transferable, and identity verified. As noted above, however, the paper is not intended to advance a specific policy outcome and takes no position on the ultimate desirability of a U.S. CBDC,"" the report said.  (It's worth noting that this report is separate from what the Boston Fed and MIT might publish. That project is looking at technical bases for central bank digital currencies, rather than the policy questions around issuing one.)  Also, we didn't learn that the Fed still really wants Congress to authorize a CBDC before it'll take any action toward doing so. Again, we knew this. What's more, even if Congress does authorize a digital dollar, the Fed announced that last week's report is just the first step in a ""broad consultation,"" implying a lengthy outreach process.  Speaking of which, members of the public can weigh in before May 2022 if they so choose. The Fed has a list of 22 questions, and responses can be sent via a web portal.  Despite how much of this report wasn't too new, a few details stood out.  The first is the Fed's desire to play a role in guiding CBDC development elsewhere in the world.  ""Irrespective of any ultimate conclusion, Federal Reserve staff will continue to play an active role in developing international standards for CBDCs,"" the report said.  Part of this international coordination would be to help cross-border payments, per the report. But the real key here seems to be a desire to maintain the dollar hegemony within the global financial system.  ""The dollar’s international role also allows the United States to influence standards for the global monetary system,"" the report noted.  The Fed's approach to privacy is also going to be a bit of a sticking point.  The central bank wants to make sure that a CBDC is transacted through entities with the proper know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) frameworks in place.  ""A general-purpose CBDC would generate data about users’ financial transactions in the same ways that commercial bank and nonbank money generates such data today. In the intermediated CBDC model that the Federal Reserve would consider, intermediaries would address privacy concerns by leveraging existing tools,"" the report said.  If this is indeed how the digital dollar is set up, it won't be a perfect analog to the physical dollar. At least at the moment, it's unclear whether there's a way to transact without intermediaries, whereas I can give anyone cash without going through a KYC process. Digital dollar proponents will say that it should enable this sort of privacy.  And finally, as pointed out by my friend Michael McSweeney over at The Block, the report highlights existing private stablecoins, though it stops short of a detailed analysis on what role the Fed sees them playing in a world where the central bank has its own digital currency.  The report also mentions concerns about financial stability, a common one among regulators ever since this one social media giant announced plans to create a stablecoin.  Energy needs  Last week’s House Financial Services Committee on Energy and Commerce (Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee) hearing on crypto’s energy use was pretty interesting, to me at least. It started out with some basic questions and explanations (“Bitcoin does not equal blockchain”), not to mention several off-topic complaints, but evolved into an in-depth discussion, even a debate between some of the witnesses on how to measure things like crypto mining’s energy efficiency.  You can catch up on the hearing on our live blog, or read the wrap we published after the hearing ended.  The debate, between Cornell Tech Professor Ari Juels and BitFury CEO Brian Brooks, may have been the most interesting aspect for me. Brooks pointed out that crypto mining machines are becoming more energy efficient all the time, but Juels pointed to the energy used per number of transactions processed to argue that more efficient machines does not mean a more efficient network.  This debate might be key to how lawmakers approach crypto mining regulation, if there is any such rulemaking in this field.  One issue that was not discussed, but perhaps should have been, was the issue of waste from facilities powering crypto miners. Environment & Energy Publishing, an energy-focused news organization (that is a subsidiary of Politico), reported last week that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rejected applications from Greenidge Generation and Sioux Energy Center (run by Ameren) to continue running coal ash ponds beyond their current federally-mandated deadlines.  Coal ash is a “toxic slurry” byproduct from coal power plants. The facilities dump this byproduct into what are basically open tanks. The risk of toxins from the ash leaching into the ground or nearby bodies of water is real, and so these facilities are regulated.  “EPA considered Greenidge disqualified from getting an exemption because it no longer uses coal for power. The agency said Ameren’s application for an extension lacked all the information required for deciding on its request,” EE News reported.  The power plants have a hair over four months to report to EPA they are no longer using their ponds.  This kind of action is worth keeping an eye on – it’s all very well to resurrect dead power plants to run crypto miners, but if these facilities can’t dump their waste they may not be able to continue operations for as long as their owners would like.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  I think we’re now once again waiting to see who gets the nod to run the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, not to mention the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  Elsewhere:  Biden Administration to Release Executive Order on Crypto as Early as February: Report: In October we learned the White House was looking to issue an executive order coordinating crypto regulatory efforts at the federal level among the non-independent departments. This seems to be less focused on issuing a specific rule and more about a general agenda, but at any rate, we might soon see it.  Introducing CoinDesk’s Privacy Week: CoinDesk is taking on the international Data Privacy Week with features, explanations, opinion submissions and a host of other pieces looking at privacy concerns and how cryptocurrency networks address them. They’re well worth a read.  Outside CoinDesk:  (Reuters) A long-form Reuters investigation by Angus Berwick and Tom Wilson revealed that crypto exchange Binance did not implement strong know-your-customer controls, and withheld information “about its finances and corporate structure from regulators,” despite what the exchange claimed in public. Reuters cited documents from Binance, correspondence between Binance employees and regulators, internal documents and interviews with former exchange employees and affiliates. Binance sent Reuters a statement but, according to the news agency, did not respond to detailed questions. Founder Changpeng Zhao has since tweeted “FUD,” continuing what appears to be an ongoing animosity toward journalism.  (Reuters) Thomson Reuters Foundation News took a look at art theft and fraud in the NFT space. Avi Asher-Schapiro spoke to NFT artists and victims of theft in laying out what the concerns are. What stood out to me the most though was a stat from DeviantArt, which now scans for art turned into NFTs without the artists’ permission. “It has flagged more than 90,000 since it started scanning in September,” Asher-Schapiro wrote.  (ScienceDirect) “Blockchain-based data transmission control for Tactical Data Link,” where TDL is a term referring to military communications links.

42390162,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bVmCZT,1643126498,Monero: The Privacy Coin Explained,"Bitcoin’s pseudonymity was originally a big part of its appeal to new users, but that pseudonymity has become strained over the years as government regulators, blockchain analytics firms and others began surveilling the Bitcoin public blockchain.  In a bid to restore balance, various developers and organizations are working to improve bitcoin privacy and make it easier to implement using techniques such as CoinJoins and coin burns.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Privacy Week series.  But privacy coins built on their own blockchains, such as Monero's XMR, still have a firm hold within the larger cryptocurrency community, even as regulators and exchanges seek to limit their adoption.  Read More: What Are Privacy Coins and Are They Legal?  What is Monero?  Monero launched in 2014 as Bitmonero and was a fork of the codebase of Bytecoin.  When Bitcointalk forum user thankful_for_today released Bitmonero, community backers were frustrated over changes that hadn’t taken place. Thankful_for_today was eventually usurped and replaced by volunteers from the community, including a handful of developers who helped maintain and develop the project. Many of them remained pseudonymous.  As one of the few original alternative coins (altcoins) that didn’t rely on Bitcoin’s code, Monero chose not to have a limited supply for XMR. Unlike other privacy coins, it embeds privacy into the protocol rather than making it an optional feature, or relying on a second layer to be developed and added later.  Monero’s privacy protections also set it aside from competitors, not just because they aren’t optional but because of the ways they hide the sender, the receiver and even the amount being sent. While Zcash chiefly uses zero-knowledge proofs, among other features, to add privacy functionality, Monero’s main privacy feature includes:  Ring confidential transactions (Ring CTs.)  Stealth addresses.  Bulletproofs.  Dandelion ++.  The underlying technology is so effective that, in 2020, the Internal Revenue Service called upon experts to help crack Monero’s privacy features; issuing a $625,000 reward to anyone who could successfully do it.  Its technology makes monero one of the most private cryptocurrencies, appealing to advocates of privacy while attracting scrutiny from regulators over concerns about that privacy.  Read More: The IRS Wants to Know More About Privacy-Enhancing Crypto Coins, Tools  What makes Monero unique?  If zcash is the Blink-182 of privacy coins, monero is the Sex Pistols – an older, grittier counterpart.  It’s certainly not for the faint of heart. Monero makes no attempt to comply with know-your-customer/anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) procedures and values privacy above all else. This has not only led to it being delisted from a number of exchanges including BitMEX and Kraken, but the project’s casual disregard for customer due diligence (CDD) measures also means it has found itself in the crosshairs of many financial regulators around the world.  On the other hand, if you’re distrustful of the government or centralized authority, Monero’s rebellious ethos may appeal to you.  The two main criteria Monero achieves are:  Untraceability: This means it’s impossible to determine where something came from – in this instance, a transaction made using XMR, the native cryptocurrency of Monero.  Unlinkability: This refers to the inability to establish a connection between people involved in a transaction or to prove various transactions were sent to the same person.  “Monero has continuously iterated on its tech,” said the organizer of the Monero Space workgroup, Justin Ehrenhofer. Ehrenhofer is also vice president of operations at Cake Wallet, an open-source wallet that originally focused solely on monero but has since added support for bitcoin and litecoin.  “There haven't been any sweeping changes in terms of what Monero does and why. It's sort of tried to stay true to what it does and just keeps hammering at it,” he added.  Ring Confidential Transactions (Ring CTs)  A ring confidential transaction is made up of two parts: One is a Multilayered Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group (MLSAG) ring signature, which obscures the amounts, origins, and destinations of transactions; the second is confidential transactions, which uses a cryptographic technique called the Pederson commitment to obscure transaction amounts.  The Pedersen commitment allows cryptography to be performed on a transaction such that the transaction can be verified while only the sender and receiver see the amount being exchanged.  Ring CTs allow “decoy” coins to be added to transactions, meaning the true amounts aren’t visible except to the parties involved. Even so, with multiple inputs, the transactions balance out such that it ensures no new monero tokens are minted in the process.  Read More: Cake Wallet Brings Usernames to Crypto Addresses With Unstoppable Domains  In October, Monero adopted CLSAGs, which is just a more efficient form of its ring signature; they were approximately 10% to 15% faster to verify, as well as smaller, according to Ehrenhofer.  Stealth addresses  Stealth addresses create an additional layer of privacy for Monero users. Stealth addresses essentially create burner addresses – or one-time public keys – for each transaction, with a sender generating a new address to send XMR tokens with a bit of additional data attached.  Those bits of data are then used by the owner of the address to create the private keys used to access the funds in the address.  Only the parties involved know the stealth address corresponds to the actual Monero address. Because new stealth addresses are generated by each sender, transactions on the blockchain don’t link back to the actual address. Think of it as calling someone repeatedly using a different phone number each time. This would make it impossible for anyone on the outside to know who was calling, and whether it was the same person or not.  Bulletproofs and Dandelion ++  In 2018, Monero implemented bulletproofs, a protocol that made confidential transactions faster and more scalable. It cut the data size of confidential transactions, which were quite large given the decoy coins involved, by about 80%.  “Blockchain bloat was definitely an issue for Monero,” said pseudonymous Monero cryptographer Sarang Noether, who assisted with the bulletproofs integration. “They’re not about anonymity; they are about assuring that the other stuff we do for anonymity works correctly.”  So while bulletproofs weren’t about adding new privacy functionality, they were key to speeding up Monero transactions while lowering the fees associated with them.  Finally, in 2020 Monero implemented Dandelion ++, a feature for hiding the IP addresses associated with nodes (computers that help to validate the Monero blockchain), so that it cut down the risk of such identifying information being used to deanonymize transactions. IP addresses could be used by internet service providers (ISP) or even virtual network providers (VPN) to identify you. Which is not ideal when you’re running a node in order to help maintain a privacy-focused network.  While originally designed for Bitcoin, Dandelion ++ was implemented for Monero. It essentially finds a proxy node to broadcast from and then spreads “fluff” information symmetrically, such that adversaries looking to track transactions are unable to do so.  “Even if you're not using Tor or the Invisible Internet Project (I2P), it's a good way for all users to have a much higher degree of base protection when broadcasting their transaction out,” said Ehrenhofer.  Room for improvement  Monero focuses on not making privacy a huge lift; rather, it attempts to make it easy for people who might not use it otherwise.  “We want to provide privacy and just clog some of the basic holes that are present in most cryptocurrency protocols,” said Ehrenhofer. “So to that end, monero really is the only coin that hides the sender, receiver and amount – which is really the bare minimum for you to even think of it as a private transaction.”  In terms of differentiating it from other coins such as bitcoin and zcash, Ehrenhofer said the proof is really just in how much Monero is used compared to other privacy-focused cryptocurrency blockchains.  “Monero has more private transactions than Bitcoin and Zcash combined,” he said.  So to him, it’s just a matter of continuing to drill down on what it does well, rather than trying to add on all sorts of other functionalities.  Even so, while Monero is a highly competent solution for protecting individuals against mass financial surveillance, it’s not as effective when authorities or blockchain surveillance teams are investigating you directly.  Ehrenhofer is the creator of the Breaking Monero series, which outlines a variety of ways in which Monero can be compromised or come up short.  He says that three challenges come to the top of mind within that series:  Poisoned outputs  A Janus attack (known fixes haven't been deployed, so only mitigations exist for now)  Metadata concerns (such as the masking of network and timing)  Poisoned outputs  Poisoned outputs pose a serious threat to the privacy of onero users because they present a human-based, rather than a technology-based, problem.  Essentially, poisoned outputs involve two colluding parties that target a third party and attempt to learn about them by sending outputs and then analyzing their transaction graphs. A transaction graph is a representation of one or more transactions and the addresses that cryptocurrencies were sent to. These could be users, mixers or exchanges, for example.  In the series “Breaking Monero,” where Monero devs stress-tested and outlined vulnerabilities for the cryptocurrency, one pseudonymous developer called Surae Noether (a common surname used among Monero developers as a homage to the famous mathematician and physicist, Emmy Noether) likens a poisoned output to how cops might track the sale of banned books within society by making a purchase and tracking the transaction to see where the funds end up.  “The essential idea is that someone is buying a book and there’s going to be a chain of custody of the money that will eventually end up in some know-your-customer bank’s hands,” said Surae in the accompanying video. “Once that money ends up in the bank’s hands, they can start linking real-life identities with those original purchases and find the interior hops of those transactions. Unfortunately, this is a problem that Monero faces.”  The reason this is a tricky problem to fix is it's not dependent so much on fixing a technical problem, but on taking care of a collusion one. More specifically, while you might be able to provide a patch to a technical issue, you can't prevent people from working together to identify who the owner of a particular crypto wallet is. That, ultimately, is outside of a coin’s control.  Janus attacks  Another is what’s known as a Janus attack. Named after the ”two-faced god” from Greek mythology, the Janus attack allows an incoming transaction to appear to be addressed to one wallet subaddress while having actually been addressed to a different wallet subaddress, said Ehrenhofer in an email.  The goal of the attack is not to steal XMR, but to compromise the address owners' privacy by tricking them into revealing control of the two subaddresses.  “In plain English, the subaddress system is designed to allow a wallet to efficiently scan for incoming outputs to multiple subaddresses within the same wallet (i.e., where the subaddresses share the same private view key),” said Ehrenhofer. “A side effect of the way in which the subaddress system was designed to allow this efficient scanning is that the wallet will trust the sender to inform the wallet of the particular destination subaddress. This trust was an oversight during the design of the subaddress system.”  While there are several ways to mitigate such an attack, one has not yet been decided on from the development perspective.  Ehrenhofer said one way is for an update to the transaction construction to include a signature that proves the transaction was properly constructed for a particular subaddress destination.  “Since this modification will add perhaps 64 bytes to the size of a transaction, there will be careful consideration of a mitigation to ensure it is done in the most space-efficient way possible,” he said.  Metadata issues  Metadata concerns are generally an issue because they’re somewhat dependent on the rails the internet rides. Obscuring things like network traffic and timing require the use of other tools and go beyond the scope of what Monero, or any privacy coin blockchain, is capable.  The case for Monero  Privacy is not just for people with “something to hide” – it is a fundamental right that people should be able to exercise without needing to justify why they choose to do so. Privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like monero are one way that people are exercising that choice.  The very fact that XMR is best known as the currency of the dark web is, in itself, a testament to its success as a privacy coin. If it didn't do such a good job of protecting its users' identities, it would have been abandoned by those users.  Read More: Riccardo ‘Fluffypony’ Spagni Released by US Court, ‘Actively Working’ on Return to South Africa  Of course, the trade-off with these sorts of open-access technologies is that anyone can use it, for good or ill. But the more that people understand the value of preserving the privacy of their data and online transactions, the more we can expect the ratio of nefarious usage to diminish compared to all other use cases.  “Monero transaction volumes are way up, with increased adoption primarily coming from the recognition that people should use Monero to protect their private payments and donations,” said Ehrenhofer. “This means that more cryptocurrency transactions than ever before are private, so we're making progress.”",NEUTRAL,XMR,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | XMR | ZEC,"Benjamin Powers, Ollie Leech",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/01/25/monero-the-privacy-coin-explained,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6cfe507a622d76e5a23d1fab09054bf56c78334a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394562,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBkMH,1643124081,Can Crypto Go Green? How to Invest in Eco-Friendly Cryptocurrencies,"By now almost everyone has heard people talk about how much energy mining bitcoin consumes. Just to power a single BTC transaction takes over 2,264 Kilowatt-hours (kWh) worth of electricity – enough to boil 1,500 kettles. But it’s not just bitcoin that has this problem. Other cryptocurrencies that also utilize the same proof of work (PoW) consensus mechanism face the same issue.  As a growing number of investors place more value on companies that emphasize environmental, social and governance principles (ESG) – especially the environmental part – makers of cryptocurrency may soon have to answer the question: Is it possible for crypto to go green?  A shift toward a greener cryptocurrency industry  Increasing awareness of crypto’s energy consumption, pressure from highly influential people like Elon Musk (who halted bitcoin payments at Tesla due to the crypto’s environmental impact) and crackdowns in major countries like China are pushing the crypto industry to adapt.  In response to these events, new and existing blockchain projects are exploring everything from migrating to less energy-intensive validation systems to exploring renewable energy-based mining. Ethereum is perhaps one of the most prominent examples of a leading cryptocurrency project that is transitioning from PoW to a proof-of-stake (PoS) system, with an aim of reducing its overall energy consumption by 99.95%.  Unlike PoW, PoS selects validators based on how many of the project’s native tokens they lock away in a staking smart contract. The more tokens a person locks away, the greater the chance they have of being picked by the protocol to add new data to the blockchain.  Similar to mining, chosen validators receive an amount of newly minted tokens as a reward for their participation. One of the biggest benefits to this system over crypto mining is the hardware requirements are significantly lower, meaning more people can become validators. This, in turn, increases a project’s decentralization and further improves the network’s security. It also has the added benefit of reducing the amount of energy required to power the network.  Read More: What is Proof-of-Stake?  There are also growing financial incentives to improve the carbon footprint of cryptocurrency as environmental policies weigh heavier in investors’ decision-making process and regulators increase their focus on crypto energy use.  Can crypto become more sustainable?  Developers and crypto advocates are making efforts toward sustainability for the blockchain and crypto ecosystem. Organizations like the Crypto Climate Accord, for example, are working toward a goal of having all blockchains powered by renewable energy by 2025, and have even produced a 32-page audit document for tallying the environmental impact of cryptocurrency. In a recently released report, the Bitcoin Mining Council surveyed 32% of its network and claimed its users were mining with a 67% renewable energy mix.  Several factors affect the sustainability and environmental impact of a cryptocurrency. Energy use is one of the most often cited, but it isn’t just a matter of which cryptocurrency uses the most power. You also have to take into account what combination of sources that power comes from.  How many mining operations are powered by renewable energy sources, if any? What validation system do they use? How much physical equipment is required to mine new coins?  Read More: The Frustrating, Maddening, All-Consuming Bitcoin Energy Debate  Renewable and repurposed power for mining  Mining operations like Equinor and Crusoe Energy have repurposed unused conventional power plants or excess gas from drilling that usually gets burned off to power mining operations. Critics have pointed out, however, that this doesn’t eliminate harmful emissions – it just transfers them to a different industry and could incentivize further drilling.  There have also been attempts to use solar or wind farms to power mining entirely with renewable energy. Houston-based tech firm Lancium, for example, announced plans to pour $150 million into renewable mining plants in 2022. And while this is laudable in theory, it might not be financially possible to construct renewable plants to power a cryptocurrency that could unexpectedly plummet in value. Bitcoin’s value tends to stay high even as it swings, but other cryptos might not be able to justify the cost of entirely new energy plants simply to mine them.  To address these shortfalls, the makers of new crypto and blockchain systems are looking to more energy-efficient designs instead.  Which cryptocurrencies are environmentally friendly?  Some newer cryptocurrencies have incorporated renewable energy into their operational model, pairing it with alternative validation methods to create a token that uses a lot less energy than its predecessors.  Cardano is a PoS cryptocurrency built on a peer-reviewed blockchain, developed by one of the co-founders of Ethereum. People buy units of Cardano to become members of the network instead of mining new coins, meaning it uses orders of magnitude less energy than something like Bitcoin. This structure also lets Cardano scale up to meet increased demand without a stratospheric increase in power consumption.  Stellar is an energy-efficient blockchain network that uses its cryptocurrency lumen (XLM) to facilitate global payments. Its consensus mechanism operates faster than proof-of-work and even proof-of-stake, relying on a group of trusted nodes to authenticate transactions. People can trade fiat and cryptocurrencies through the Stellar network, and use it as a way to send things like remittance payments across borders without incurring steep fees or lengthy transaction times.  Nano is another low-energy crypto that’s been around since 2015. It doesn't rely on mining, instead using “blockchain lattice” technology that creates user blockchains for everyone on the Nano network. Transactions are confirmed by Open Representative Voting (ORV), where representatives voted in by members of the network act as validators. It lets users transact peer-to-peer on their own blockchains instead of having to use the main network blockchain, cutting down on time and energy.  Hedera Hashgraph is a cryptocurrency that could rival major payment processors like Visa in terms of transactions per second while using much less energy than bitcoin. Transactions are processed in parallel instead of linearly, making Hedera faster than legacy cryptocurrencies like bitcoin with the company claiming up to 100,000 transactions per second can be processed through its network. The makers of Hedera are also using its network to build sustainability projects like their Power Transition energy tracking software.  Gridcoin uses the power from idle computers connected to its network for scientific research through the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC). It uses proof-of- stake and users get rewarded with a proof-of-research algorithm. Gridcoin has been around since 2013, and some of the projects currently using power from its network include mapping the Milky Way galaxy via MilkyWay@Home.  These are just a few of the new cryptocurrencies being developed with sustainability in mind.  Advancements in consensus mechanisms and a focus on utilizing renewable energy sources would lower the overall environmental cost of cryptocurrency and blockchain networks with wide adoption. There is still the problem of e-waste from legacy mining operations to deal with, but non-PoW cryptocurrencies would drive down the demand to build newer and larger mining rigs in the future, potentially reducing that waste.",POSITIVE,BTC | XLM,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | XLM,John Bogna,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/can-crypto-go-green-how-to-invest-in-eco-friendly-cryptocurrencies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea485ce24fb63570742dabe0a83c6dea6abd4b9d-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The way the existing internet has evolved, our data is segregated across many different applications and services, such as behavioral data collected by Google and Facebook, or our credit histories on scoring websites and government agencies. An aggregate data layer connected and incentivized in such a way that applications can query it is lacking, said Project Galaxy co-founder Harry Zhang.  “You don’t own that data, these big companies and services are monetizing it,” said Zhang in an interview. “But since we are in a Web 3 world now, we can use open permissionless blockchain technology and finally have the chance to build the infrastructure for this aggregated layer of credential data that’s accessible to all developers in Web 3.”  Project Galaxy, which is live and in use, manages the largest credential data network in Web 3 – a re-architecturing of the existing Web 2 world, leaning towards decentralized consensus mechanisms, rather than a handful of monolithic platforms.  Structurally, Project Galaxy looks and functions very similar to The Graph. There are credential contributors, curators and consumers.  “The Graph is one of the data sources in our infrastructure,” Zhang said. “You can submit these sub-graph queries so that they can turn them into our credential data, which they will earn on our network.”  Read more: The Graph, the 'Google of Blockchains,' Raises $50M in Round Led by Tiger Global  Participants who contribute data to Project Galaxy or curate data on the system can earn money when that data is queried and used. This could be private data about an individual, or it could be public data curated from the blockchain realm as well as Web 2 applications like Twitter, TikTok or GitHub, Zhang explained.  “We are building this very permissionless and open infrastructure, and we don’t want to restrict any use case,” Zhang said. “For now, the focus is on the side of loyalty programs, growth hacking campaigns, maybe credit scoring in the near future, and we also have a number of projects using us to customize voting systems.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/25/decentralized-data-sharing-network-project-galaxy-raises-10m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/953169fe2f476eb27f63c7eaa4298ec97ae4c8e2-4587x3058.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42375445,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7udj,1643122368,Inside the Company Building Japan's Multistakeholder Digital Yen,"The Tokyo metro has a unique – and sometimes frustrating – feature. Unlike most subway systems in the world, it is operated by several different companies and a branch of the municipal government, which often means you need different tickets for different lines.  Japan’s digital yen might look a lot like that.  Tokyo-based DeCurret, with 50-odd employees, is leading the design of the digital yen and coordinates the Digital Currency Forum (DCF), a consortium of 74 of Japan’s biggest banks and firms that look to roll out the digital currency.  Under the proposed model, commercial banks will issue the digital yen as a liability on their books, much like run-of-the-mill deposits, according to a white paper released in November.  Decurret will set up a platform that banks can use to issue the digital currency, as well as plans to issue the digital yen by the end of 2022, with trials set to start as soon as January.  In a country where the government is often sluggish but the private sector has a deep history of innovation, it is not surprising that entrepreneurs are stepping in to design a digital currency that will smooth corporate finance.  Read more: Japanese Consortium Plans to Issue Bank Deposit-Like Digital Yen by End of Next Year  Well-connected  DeCurret was born out of the Internet Initiative Japan, the country’s first internet service provider (founded in 1992), now listed on the Tokyo stock exchange. IIJ not only owns 40% of DeCurret but it is the source of much of its management team, Keisuke Ito, head of DeCurret's Business Planning Group and Public Relations, told CoinDesk. DeCurret’s chairman, Satoshi Murabayashi, is also an executive vice president at the IIJ. Both IIJ’s chief operating officer and chief financial officer are directors at DeCurret.  The IIJ connection helped DeCurret secure funding, but also convinced major firms to join the digital currency forum, Ito said.  The member list includes MUFG Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., Mizuho Bank, Japan Post Bank, as well as industrial behemoths including Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp., East Japan Railway and Mitsubishi Corp., as well as local governments.  The company also has connections to the national government, with the former chairman of the Financial Services Agency, Toshihide Endo, an adviser. The Financial Services Agency, Bank of Japan and three ministries are also sitting in on the discussions.  Stairway to digital currency  Since its founding DeCurret had its eyes on launching a digital currency, but due to stablecoin regulation in Japan the company started out with a crypto exchange business, Ito said. The thinking was that working on blockchain technology would further DeCurret’s digital currency ambitions, regardless of the specific use case, according to Ito.  It’s been three years since the exchange started but it has yet to turn a profit, Ito said, citing high competition. Big exchanges that have been in the market for a while have seen rising trading volume and profits, he said. But this trend is “more about existing traders who are increasing their volumes,” rather than newcomers, so new entrants are having a hard time, he said.  Crypto exchanges in Japan have had a hard time turning a profit, with many struggling to keep up with compliance rules. Taxes of up to 55% on gains have spurred some exchanges to pack their bags and head overseas.  Read more:Japan’s Crypto Exchanges Grapple With ‘Travel Rule’ as Deadline Looms  The digital yen  DeCurret’s digital yen will be issued by different banks using its platform, for which the company will be charging the banks. The ledger of each bank will come together in the so-called Common Area, where a central ledger of the digital yen’s supply will be kept, according to the white paper. In the Business Process Area, another environment, users will be able to interface with the digital yen through applications.  In its initial stages, the digital yen will be a product for corporates looking to reduce costs in large scale B2B transactions. Within the next two years, DeCurret’s target is to “have customers who are really using this platform as a business and paying us fees,” Ito said. Down the line, the company will also work as a settlement service between individuals and businesses, he said.  The various subcommittees in the 74-member development association are working to come up with use cases for the digital yen.  DeCurret has been working with the BoJ and other government agencies to set up a regulatory system, and they have “sort of come up with a legal scheme which would allow private banks to issue the coins,” Ito said.  The central bank is also looking into a digital currency, but DeCurret doesn’t view this exactly as competition, Ito said. A privately issued digital yen can coexist with a CBDC, much like right now where central banks coexist with private banks, and Tokyo’s private metro lines coexist with the municipal ones.

42417090,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRweq5,1643121632,What If We Get Online Privacy Right? A Glimpse of 2035,"It’s the year 2035. The bad news: There are no flying cars (although a cryogenically youthful Elon Musk is working on it), the United States is still bitterly divided, and the New YorkJets football team still doesn’t have a quarterback.  But there is one silver lining: We’ve somehow fixed all the problems with online privacy.  It’s done. We made it happen.  What would that world look like? How would your day-to-day life be different? That’s the spirit of this exercise. It’s not a prediction, it’s not an argument, and it’s not pretending to know exactly how we cracked the code. And of course all of this is very much in doubt.  “We’re at a crossroads,” said Tim Pastoor, a researcher in the Netherlands who focuses on digital identity. “We can either head towards a more utopian vision of how we do things, or a more dystopian vision.”  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Privacy Week series.  It’s easy to imagine the dystopia. “Look at China, for example,” Pastoor said. “If you say something the government doesn’t like, you’re not allowed onto planes and trains, and your kids aren’t allowed to go to school, and you’re not allowed to receive health care.”  But what about the flip side? In one sense, perhaps the answer is dead simple: The world looks exactly how it does today in the United States, but your privacy is secure.  “If we succeed at fixing the infrastructure, then what we get is that the culture and the norms that we all currently share … survive,” said Zooko Wilcox, founder of the zcash privacy coin. So maybe just “Avoiding the China Scenario” is enough of a win.  But there are certain concrete, tangible ways that your life could improve. And some privacy experts think this is feasible.  “It’s easy for people to think it’s hopeless and there’s nothing we can do,” said Jon Callas, director of technology projects at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit devoted to defending digital privacy. “But there are things that are being done that have the potential to be very good. And if we do them right, we can have a better privacy-enhanced world.”  Welcome to that vision of the future.  Privacy-protected social media and online shopping  7:30 a.m. You log onto social media (which has deteriorated into an unholy blend of one-second videos and emojis), eager to comment on the presidential contest between Chelsea Clinton and Barron Trump. Logging in is a breeze. You don’t need to remember any passwords. Instead, you use a “Privacy Broker” – a company that acts as your intermediary and shields your data.  Apple is already working on early versions of this solution, such as its “Private Relay” now in beta. “We want more people to be doing this,” Callas said.  9:37 a.m. You go online to buy a few of the basics: Toenail fungus remover, cold sore treatment, a BDSM kit, medicine for diarrhea and a vintage album from One Direction.  You’re not embarrassed. You know you won’t be served up ads for toe fungus for the next month. And you know that the data cannot be turned over to the government … or anyone.  That’s not the case today.  “Under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), all sorts of transactions from banks and other financial intermediaries [can be] turned over to the government, by default, without a warrant,” said Marta Belcher, general counsel at Protocol Labs, a research and development center for network protocols. Thanks to a court precedent called the “third-party doctrine,” in today’s world, “If any third party has your data, you lose your reasonable expectation of privacy.”  So the BSA would need to be changed to protect digital privacy. Belcher is optimistic that will happen by 2035, saying, “I think that the warrantless financial surveillance under the BSA is unconstitutional, and if it went up to the Supreme Court, I believe they would agree.”  In-person shopping in a privacy-protected world  12:04 p.m. On your lunch break you head to the grocery store, and even offline shopping is now a snap.  The grocery store won’t collect your data. The police won’t get your data.  “I would like to walk into a grocery store and pick up all my groceries, and walk out, and know that I’m paying a fair price,” Wilcox said. “And I’m safe doing this, because I’m not giving anyone … the right to watch me all the time.”  In the scenario Wilcox imagines, “The computer that I carry around with me is negotiating with the grocery store computer and making sure that both people are happy with the deal … so I don’t have to think about it.”  Privacy-preserving IDs  12:37 p.m. While you’re out running errands, you stop by the liquor store to buy a bottle of wine. The cashier asks to see your ID. He’s a sketchy-looking dude. He stares at you while you shop, he’s openly leering and you don’t love the idea of showing him an ID that reveals your full name, much less your home address.  But you don’t need to.  You flash him an ID, he scans a barcode, and the only thing he can see is the only thing he needs to see: that you are at least 21. Done and done. Creepy Dude can’t see your address or age.  This is thanks to the magic of zero-knowledge proofs – basically an encrypted way of showing that a statement is “true” without revealing the underlying information used to reach that conclusion. They could be especially useful for IDs. “Privacy preserving IDs are happening,” said callas, who has written extensively on the subject.  “Colorado is at the forefront” of innovating with mobile and privacy-respecting drivers licenses, Callas said, along with “half a dozen other states.”  Consumer control of targeted ads  3:00 p.m. You see a hyper-specific ad: The exact shirt you were hoping would go on sale, and now it’s 50% off.  You weren’t served up the ad because some algorithm was stalking your online behavior; instead, you were empowered to get what you want.  Pastoor has a theory for how this could work. “It’s more of a white-listing principle,” he said. Instead of centralized companies cranking out algorithms from your trove of personal data, you would simply provide information – the “white list” – of things that interest you.  “You add a shirt to the wish list, and you opt into service providers that serve you the best possible deal,” Pastoor said. “If they start spamming you, then you can remove them from your network.” The idea shares DNA with the technologist Doc Searls’ vision of an “intention economy,” where individuals and buyers control the data and set the terms … not the centralized sellers.  4:17 p.m. You see another online ad, also hyper-specific, for the exact sofa you just searched for… and you are not creeped out.  You have no reason to be. In this 2035 world that respects privacy, thanks to a combination of things that we get right – such as the above “white list” idea, or privacy regulation, or more decentralized solutions, or competitive privacy brokers – you know that your data is not being used to track or target you, and you can relax.  Contrast this to today. Amie Stepanovich, vice president of U.S. policy at the Future of Privacy Forum, said that if we get online privacy right, then even if our day-to-day lives won’t look all that different, but they will feel different.  The future could lack the “creepy element” of how we now view technology, she said. We put up with this creepy feeling (like the kind we get from hyper-targeted ads) simply because we have no choice; it’s the only way to join online society. For many, it’s an agonizing tradeoff.  We often feel an eerie sense of invasion – that Big Tech’s omniscient knowledge of our personal data is used to target and define us. “In a world where those types of invasive activities aren’t allowed to happen, people should be more comfortable with technology, because they know their rights won’t be abused,” Stepanovich said.  The right to be forgotten  5:08 p.m. You have a hot take about Tom Brady’s game last night. Brady threw four interceptions and fumbled twice, and you go online to joke that this is the year that the 57-year-old hangs up his cleats.  Maybe your take won’t age well. (You’ve posted the same thing for 16 years; you’re always wrong.) But it doesn’t matter, because soon the post will auto-delete.  “My hot take on last night’s [Stephen] Colbert episode really only needs to be around for a week,” said Callas, who personally uses a tool called Semiphemeral that scrubs and deletes his online posts, subject to certain parameters. (Tweets with X number of retweets might remain, for example.)  Callas imagines this kind of service expanding and going mainstream in the future, as it tackles a different flavor of online privacy – we forget that we’re leaving a public digital trail of all of our fleeting opinions, no matter how spontaneous or dumb.  “People should be able to shed their past,” Callas said. “If people can’t shed their past, they can’t ever change their mind.”  Employee privacy  7:00 p.m. You chill out to watch “Fast and the Furious 23.” And while you watch Vin Diesel race cars around the rings of Saturn, something magical happens: Nothing.

Your workplace respects your privacy.  “No texts or emails after 5 p.m.,” said U.S. military whistle-blower and privacy activist Chelsea Manning, who views the breaching of our personal time as an overlooked violation of privacy.  She notes that long ago, in a simpler time, we worked a 40-hour week where we punched out at 5 p.m., commuted home and then enjoyed our evening.  “We don’t have that anymore,” she said. “And that is a privacy issue. That’s your employer invading your privacy. I believe this.”  Sexual privacy  10:30 p.m. You head to an adult website. (Yes. That kind of website. We’re all human.)

And thanks to a combination of cryptocurrency adoption and new legal safeguards, no one is able to exert financial censorship.  “This is something ordinary people don’t notice, but there’s a subset of people for whom it’s already a huge problem,” said Belcher, who notes that OnlyFans, for example, was forced to ban sexual content to appease Visa and Mastercard.  “In the sex work context, this is very apparent for them in their day-to-day lives,” she said. “In the best-case scenario, that financial censorship is gone, and people can transact openly, without Visa and Mastercard dictating what speech is and is not allowed on the internet.”  Peace of Mind  12:00 a.m. You go to bed not worrying that anything you have done today will be used against you, sold to third parties or somehow embarrass you.

A memo from national grid operator KEGOC, dated Jan. 21 and seen by CoinDesk, said that ""the planned supply of electricity to persons engaged in digital mining is completely canceled"" from Jan. 24 until midnight Jan. 31. Kazakhstan's energy grid has been struggling to meet power demand, especially during the winter. KEGOC said it will consider rolling the limitations back if the energy situation improves.  The memo was signed by KEGOC Managing Director for System Services and NES Development Bekhzan Mukatov and sent to 196 power generating, transmission and energy trading companies.  Making matters worse is that a major transmission line was disconnected after a ""significant emergency imbalance"" in the Central Asian power system led to a power surge in Kazakhstan's North-East-South 500-kilovolt (kV) power transmission line, KEGOC said on Tuesday. On the same day, major cities in Kazakhstan and in neighboring Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan subsequently suffered power outages, Reuters reported.  Kazakhstan was home to about one-fifth of the world's bitcoin mining at the end of August 2021, according to data from the University of Cambridge Center of Alternative Finance. But local miners have been faced with electricity rationing during the current shortage. Some miners are looking overseas to grow their businesses, particularly given that the government has proposed a 100-megawatt energy limit for all new crypto mines.

42407257,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gULTLF,1643120525,How Popular Are Crypto Mixers? Here’s What the Data Tells Us,"Cryptocurrency mixers and the illicit activity often associated with them regularly make headlines. To the casual observer, the frequency of these attention-grabbing stories can give the impression that crypto mixing is far more prevalent than it is. Data tells us mixer transactions make up a shockingly small fraction of overall crypto activity.  Since Bitcoin’s inception, blockchain technology has been closely associated with the dark web, money laundering, tax evasion and worse. Just last year millions in bitcoin were paid in ransom to the hackers of the Colonial Pipeline, further perpetuating the public's belief about the underground world of blockchain-based currencies.  In reality, being a distributed, public ledger makes the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains overly transparent.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Privacy Week series.  By just knowing a public wallet address, one can track all past and future transactions of the account. Any association between exchanges, entities or doxxed individuals – private individuals who have had publicly revealing identifying information about them published online, either intentionally or unintentionally – could give insight into who is doing what in each transaction.  In one respect, transparency is quite refreshing as societal and ecosystem norms are often imposed on venture capital firms, project founders and other members of the crypto community. However, the need for privacy exists if crypto is ever to take on a mainstream role in payments, finance and banking.  The Bitcoin and Ethereum communities understood the downside of transparency and have since built infrastructure to allow users to opt-in to further privacy through potential “unregulated or controversial” technology.  Read More: Bitcoin Mixers: How Do They Work and Why Are They Used?  Bitcoin mixers: In the beginning  Early on, Bitcoin privacy was achieved through centralized mixing services that required trust in third parties. A user would send bitcoin to a company that “mixed” or “tumbled” the funds with other depositors’ bitcoin and then sent back an equivalent amount of mixed bitcoin on the other end. Users who wanted privacy were, in effect, exchanging their bitcoins for other bitcoins that couldn’t be associated with their own.  There was a substantial risk in using these mixing services. Users had to entrust their coins to the third-party mixing platform and believe that they’d get their funds back. Bitcoiners especially took issue with that idea since the Bitcoin protocol counts trustlessness as one of its core tenets. Centralized services were also at risk of being shut down due to regulatory action, and many early mixers were shut down.  In 2013, Greg Maxwell proposed CoinJoin, a transaction privacy method that involved no changes to Bitcoin itself. A CoinJoin takes advantage of how Bitcoin transactions are structured with a bitcoin input from a user, a signature that allows that input to be sent, and an output location for that bitcoin to end up. The signatures are unique for each input. Although these inputs usually come from the same user, they are not required to be. This is how CoinJoin works: Many users can contribute multiple inputs to a transaction where they ultimately send bitcoin to themselves on the other side, but the details are obfuscated due to the unknown number of parties who contributed inputs.  CoinJoins have always worked on Bitcoin, but there wasn’t always an easy way for users to collaborate and carry out a CoinJoin to enable privacy. Now, there are bitcoin wallets like Wasabi Wallet and Samourai Wallet that allow users to implement PayJoins, an implementation of CoinJoin, within the wallet, making privacy available to all.  Bitcoin mixer usage  However, even though these privacy options have been around since 2018, the volume data suggests the penetration of CoinJoins has not increased much since the early days. Although more bitcoin has been CoinJoined each year, the highest volume month was just over 65,000 BTC in January 2021 (worth about $2.3 billion, on average), a scant 0.35% of the total bitcoin transacted in that month.  The same phenomenon shows itself when considering “Fresh Bitcoin” – a metric that describes new bitcoins that use a CoinJoin that have never been mixed before.  We can see that these data sets look strikingly similar, but the Fresh Bitcoin metric likely provides a more realistic view for demand growth for CoinJoins, given some users opt to mix the same bitcoins multiple times in order to increase privacy and mathematically guarantee untraceability. The number of Fresh Bitcoins CoinJoined in January 2021 was closer to 45,000, or 0.25% of the total bitcoin transacted in that month.  Part of this overall lack of adoption can be due to exchanges blocking withdrawals to privacy-preserving bitcoin wallets, such as Wasabi, which would naturally suppress demand for CoinJoin as mixing would disrupt the fungibility of the owner’s bitcoin. That is, the bitcoin that went through a mixer would be ""tainted"" and treated differently by the exchange than other bitcoin.  The future of bitcoin mixers  Taproot was an important upgrade made to the Bitcoin protocol that was implemented late last year. Taproot enabled a handful of potential usability and privacy improvements, with the addition of Schnorr signatures an address type to Bitcoin that makes types of transactions look the same, making blockchain forensic analysis more difficult for multisignature transactions.  As it relates to mixer traffic, however, Taproot in its current state does not improve the privacy of CoinJoins because their inputs are single signature.  That said, Taproot’s activation sets the groundwork in order for cross-input aggregation (CISA) in the future, which would allow for improved privacy and efficiency of CoinJoin transactions. Digital signatures are the critical piece that allows CoinJoins to work. If CISA makes it into the Bitcoin protocol, the many signatures needed in a CoinJoin transaction could be combined and aggregated into one, which could boost scalability and make the process cheaper.  Tornado Cash: A mixer for Ethereum  The most popular mixer on Ethereum takes a different approach than CoinJoin because it is built and deployed on the application layer. Tornado Cash allows ETH holders to deposit a sum of their token balance into a non-upgradable smart contract that gives them an encrypted note. Using the encrypted note, the user can withdraw the funds from another Ethereum address in a single or multiple transactions.  One step further, Tornado Cash allows third parties called “relayers” to send that encrypted note verifying the withdrawal transaction to application users. In return for passing the note, relayers receive a small fee. The relayer system allows users to have their funds trustlessly withdrawn into a new wallet, without needing ETH in the new wallet to pay for the claim transaction because the relayers also take care of covering that cost on their behalf.  It is important to note that relayers are not able to access any transaction data beyond paying the transaction fee, stopping them from altering the destination of the claimed funds.  At the end of the process, the user who deposited their assets into Tornado Cash now has them in a fresh wallet, leaving behind a very difficult trail to follow. In turn, the relayer takes a small fraction of the deposit to pay for the claim transaction and reward them for their service.  Tornado Cash usage  Tornado Cash version 1 has been live since the end of 2019 and has processed 2.4 million ETH and $5.1 billion U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins at the time of writing, according to data from Dune Analytics and Etherscan. Most often used was the fixed deposit of 10 ETH, with the contract seeing 13,819 transactions since December 2019.  November of last year was the largest month for Tornado in terms of volume, processing over $200 million ETH and stablecoin withdrawals in the last week of the month. However, during December the application released a new product dubbed Nova. The upgrade allows users to deposit arbitrary amounts of assets instead of the outdated, tiered and fixed deposit limits. Nova has seen some adoption with 673 wallets depositing 633 ETH in the new platform in less than a month.  While Ethereum’s most popular mixer is often publicized for its use after decentralized finance (DeFi) exploits or nefarious activities, the application appears to be growing in popularity among everyday users concerned with operational security (opsec) and privacy. Recent compliance integrations even allow the application to generate a report on whether an address's use of Tornado Cash was in relation to any known exploits or laundering, so law-abiding users can access the technology without drawing unnecessary suspicion.  Read More: Crypto.com’s Stolen Ether Being Laundered via Tornado Cash  The double-edged sword of crypto mixers  The adoption of DeFi, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and bitcoin have gone parabolic over the past year, making illicit activities a smaller percentage of overall crypto transactions than ever. A recent Chainalysis report revealed that even as the notional value of illegal activity hit $14 billion, illicit transactions only made up 0.15% of all cryptocurrency volume during 2021.  Mixers will continue to support those with ill intentions – but that is the double-edged sword of privacy and decentralization. Not only is anyone allowed to access and use blockchain wallets, developers are allowed to build and deploy any product they deem fit on top of smart contract platforms like Ethereum.  As it stands now, regular bank accounts provide us a high level of personal privacy from our friends and family. It is exceedingly difficult to find out how much money someone has in their bank account even if you know a lot of identifying information about that person.  With cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, if your wallet address becomes known, your balance and all your crypto activities can become known. Bitcoin and Ethereum should be able to provide that privacy at a minimum, and the use of privacy-focused technologies like mixers provides that option to everyday crypto users.  However promising mixers are for privacy, the data shows that users are still not taking advantage of what they have to offer. Meanwhile, the mainstream narrative points to mixers enabling illicit activity rather than the potential benefits they may provide to individuals.  More education on the topic, and less stigmatization of mixers themselves, could go a long way toward improving personal financial privacy.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | FIAT | RESEARCH,"George Kaloudis, Edward Oosterbaan",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/01/25/how-popular-are-crypto-mixers-heres-what-the-data-tells-us,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/454ac70c36218d10933bd00e5195cf2f25625f16-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375458,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7uwb,1643119233,Syndicate Launches Tool for Spinning Up DAOs With Legal Docs,"Spinning up a cryptocurrency-fueled investment community in the form of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) should be as easy as creating a group chat.  That’s according to Syndicate Protocol, a decentralized investment platform tapping into the power of social networks, which announced on Tuesday the beta launch of its first crypto-native investing tool: Web3 Investment Clubs.  The startup, which raised $20 million in the summer of last year, has taken the concept of traditional investment clubs, where groups of people are invited to meet up in town halls, restaurants and the like, to pool their capital and discuss investing in stocks, bonds or real estate – and revamped it for a blockchain age.  Traditional investment clubs are generally not regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), but there are certain guidelines set out by the regulator. Ultimately it’s up to the individual DAOs that run on top of Syndicate Protocol and use its dashboards to manage those particular organizations in accordance with their jurisdictions.  That said, Syndicate has gone some way towards making it easier to comply with whatever requirements are necessary, explained the protocol’s co-founder, Ian Lee.  “We’ve worked with a number of external partners like law firm Latham & Watkins, who helped advise in the creation of the different legal templates and tools, specifically for investment clubs that are embedded in the product,” Lee said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Lee said Syndicate is also partnering with Doola, a platform that helps incorporate businesses in the U.S. and which will help DAOs become legal entities, open fiat bank accounts and even file taxes and issue K-1s to members, he added.  Sea change  It’s not the first time an antiquated but essentially sound idea has been made new with the help of blockchains and tokenization; decentralized insurance alternative Nexus Mutual took the idea of community-based mutuals and tailored it to decentralized finance (DeFi).  Lee’s partner, Syndicate co-founder Will Papper, pointed out that investment clubs were quite hard to set up in the past and rather limited in scope. Not so with DAOs, however.  “Translating [investment clubs] to the DAO space will open up the sea change in terms of what the future of capital allocation looks like,” said Papper in an interview. “The end results will be so, so different. It’s like the shift from film and media to YouTube, in terms of its ease of use, cost reduction and distribution.”  Syndicate is already working with a number of Web 3 communities including South Park Commons, Vector DAO, Global Coin Research (GCR), Chapter One, DAO Jones, Awesome People DAO, Eve Investment Club and Morii Music DAO.  VC disruptors  Syndicate stalwart GCR has been labeled a disruptor of the traditional VC model; the latter typically means employing a team of full-time staffers and a handful of execs who make a final investment decision, while also relying on a whole ecosystem of people who don’t generally see any upside.  Since last year, when GCR turned itself into a DAO using Syndicate, it has invested some $26 million of funds contributed by its crypto-focused accredited-investor participants, said GCR founder Joyce Yang.  “It feels like we are pushing the forefront of how research is written by the community and also how deals are invested,” said Yang in an interview. “And I think Syndicate has really listened to the community about what new investment styles are developing and then built an MVP [minimum viable product] to see what really sticks with the community.”  Julia Lipton, founder of Awesome People DAO, recalled how she’s been in a WhatsApp group with a bunch of female fund managers for years.  “Now we can spin up on Syndicate, so it doesn’t just have to be talk. Every group chat can become a shared wallet that can become an investment vehicle,” Lipton told CoinDesk. “It’s about having the ability to quickly form a legal investment entity that you can easily put money in and out of, and not worry about having to do the work of a fund manager.”  UPDATE (Jan. 25, 19:30 UTC): Changes headline.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/25/syndicate-launches-tool-for-turning-daos-into-llcs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2a5d9bec1e299e841e0fe0c240f2df464f55db85-5184x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

But recently, USDC is creating a notable milestone as it out-runs Tether on the Ethereum network in terms of the total supply. Since 2016, Tether seems to be the top stablecoin, ranking the most popular. This is after its market sharing with BitUSD and NuBits (USNBT). From its launch in 2014, Tether operated on Omni.

According to a statement published Tuesday, BIS is planning projects to explore CBDCs, next-generation payments systems, DeFi and green finance through its Innovation Hub in 2022.  “CBDCs and improvements in payments systems continue to be an area of exploratory focus, accounting for 13 out of 17 projects that were active in 2021 or will be launched in 2022,” according to the statement.  At the end of last year, at least 64 central banks were exploring a retail CBDC, according to the CBDC Tracker. Of those, 20 have been launched or tested or were in the very advanced exploration stages. China has been trialing a digital currency, the eCNY, over the past year, running transactions worth around $9.7 billion. Last October, Nigeria's central bank launched the eNaira, while the European central bank kicked off a two year experiment into a retail CBDC. Last week the U.S. Federal Reserve published a discussion paper on the benefits and risks of a U.S. implementation.  The BIS Innovation Hub has been on a growth streak, setting up research centers in Hong Kong, London, Stockholm, Singapore and Switzerland in the last two years. All of them will be working on at least one project related to CBDCs.  One London project, for instance, will look at how individuals and businesses can benefit from the development of CBDCs, while a second will develop a platform supporting applications with retail CBDCs.  In November 2021, BIS helped the New York Federal Reserve to set up a fintech research wing, also focusing on projects to do with CBDCs and stablecoins. In early January, BIS brought in CBDC expert Raphael Auer as the head of the Innovation Hub’s European region.  Last year, the global head of the Innovation Hub, Benoît Cœuré, signaled central banks across the world to start working on CBDCs.  “CBDCs will take years to be rolled out, while stablecoins and crypto assets are already here. This makes it even more urgent to start,” Cœuré said in September.  As for DeFi, details are sparse, but a new project at the Hong Kong center plans to explore whether DeFi technologies including blockchain, tokenization and smart contracts, can “improve financing for small and medium enterprises, a historically underserved market segment.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | RESEARCH,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/01/25/bis-innovation-hub-to-focus-on-cbdc-defi-experimentation-this-year,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/519c4274547a36d98c9318707a31d30a02a1530f-1024x630.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The combined company is expected to be renamed to BitFuFu Inc and will be listed on the Nasdaq in Q3 under the ticker FUFU, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.  The transaction includes a $70 million fully committed investment, led by Bitmain and mining pool firm Antpool, at $10 per share, the statement said. The merger will bring in over $129 million in net cash proceeds for BitFuFu, according to the press release.  The merged firm will have pro forma value of $1.5 billion, 4.6 times the projected 2022 revenue, according to the release. Assuming that bitcoin prices go over $45,000, BitFuFu expects 2022 revenue to hit $330 million, up from $100 million in 2021, and its net income before deductions to be $100 million, according to the press release.  The cloud mining platform offers users the ability to lease hardware and facilities from the firm. It expects to increase its hashrate to 10 exahash/second (EH/s) by the end of 2022, from 3 EH/s at the end of 2021. The bitcoin mining hashrate is a measure of computing power on the network.  The deal is expected to be completed in Q3, pending regulatory and stockholder approval. Existing BitFuFu stockholders will hold onto their equity in full, and BitFuFu's management will remain at the company's helm, the release added.  Separately, BitFuFu said in its official Telegram group on Jan. 21 that its servers had been relocated to the U.S. from Kazakhstan and its hashrate has been restored.

42375456,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7usp,1643115143,Fed Preview: How Rate Hikes Could Stimulate Demand for Stablecoins,"With the price of bitcoin (BTC) tanking and the U.S. Federal Reserve now moving to tamp down rising inflation, some analysts think dollar-pegged stablecoins could be this year's winning crypto trade.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed's monetary policy-setting committee, holds its January meeting starting Tuesday. Traditional and crypto investors will be awaiting what is said during this meeting, likely the last before several interest rate increases are announced during this year.  While other central banks may keep their monetary policy loose, the Fed is expected to tighten in order to slow increasing inflation. The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 7% in December from 12 months earlier, the highest annual inflation rate since 1982. President Joe Biden has said it's “appropriate” for the central bank to “recalibrate” its monetary policy.  The FOMC, which sets the Fed’s monetary policy, holds eight two-day meetings every year. The next one after this week's will be in March.  Many analysts and investors view traditional economic factors like inflation and interest rates as having an effect on bitcoin's price.  Based on futures contract prices on the CME, the bond market predicts the first interest rate hike will take place at the March meeting. Until then, traders predict, the Fed will keep the fed funds rate — that is, the interest it charges banks to borrow from it — in a range between 0 and 25 basis points.  Dollar strength  According to a January report by Bank of America, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is also expected to acknowledge at a press conference on Wednesday that every meeting in the near future is “live,” meaning the U.S. central bank’s usual practice of carefully telegraphing the outcome of upcoming meetings might not apply – so rate increases might be less predictable. The last time the Fed raised interest rates was in 2018.  Higher interest rates on dollar-denominated assets will likely increase demand for the dollar and could result in a strengthening greenback in 2022. This could translate this year into higher demand for stablecoins, particularly dollar-pegged stablecoins.  “Stablecoins are a ‘medium’ between fiat currencies like the dollar and cryptocurrencies,"" said Scott Bauer, a former Goldman Sachs trader who's now CEO of Prosper Trading Academy. ""Given that the Fed is likely raising interest rates multiple times this year, which should essentially provide tailwinds for the dollar, stablecoins which are tied to the dollar can also capture this upside.”  With the U.S. dollar (USD) still the world's dominant reserve currency, assets denominated in greenbacks are in high demand. So stablecoins might provide a relatively easy way to gain exposure to USD.  “For the foreseeable future, there will always be demand for dollar assets, which include stablecoins,"" said Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at crypto investment manager Arca. ""If the dollar strengthens against other currencies, it will make dollar-based stablecoins more attractive.” He added that the growth in stablecoins could continue regardless of the value of the dollar.  The cryptocurrency market is currently experiencing a tough run, with bitcoin (BTC) trading at around $36,303, down over 45% from its all-time-high, and ether (ETH) at $2,398. In contrast, stablecoin prices are designed to be pegged to a fiat currency on a 1:1 basis, including those pegged to the U.S. dollar.  “If global inflationary concerns persist and [stablecoins] become more globally ubiquitous, there's no reason we wouldn't see a continued march upwards for USD stablecoin market cap due to inflows from other nations with struggling currencies,” Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at FundStrat, said. “Ironically, this would result in a more robust crypto ecosystem and increased USD dominance.”  Bitcoin is down about 23% for the year to date and its volatility is still a major concern among investors. Yet, Farrell doesn’t see this as a long-term situation.  “The USD is still losing value against many other asset classes,” said Farrell. “Thus, while some traders might seek near-term shelter in stables, the cause would be macro uncertainty, not so much a preference for the dollar over bitcoin.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/25/fed-preview-how-rate-hikes-could-stimulate-demand-for-stablecoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/355dde7d96e8335ba20048fb391121b501c9bd00-4735x3158.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Regulators will consider exercising their power to limit the use of crypto for payments, and will issue new guidelines for certain digital assets that support the financial system and innovation without posing systemic risk, according to the statement on Tuesday.  Crypto firms have expanded their business to offer payment services using crypto and have solicited payments business by facilitating the acceptance of crypto, the joint statement said.  These efforts may widen the use of crypto as a means of payment, away from its use as an investment, which could adversely impact financial stability, consumer privacy, and cybercrime, according to the statement.  Separately, the Thai SEC is seeking comment on a consultation paper on digital assets until Feb. 8.  The paper proposes to ban merchants from advertising and facilitating digital assets as means of payment and prohibits exchanges and brokerages from providing systems that help merchants receive payments in crypto, such as QR codes and e-wallets.  Following the consultation, there would also be limits on transferring assets between accounts; for example, Thai baht made from selling crypto assets can only be transferred to the seller's account.

The ratio climbed to 15 on Monday, hitting the highest since Oct. 25, a chart provided by TradingView shows.  Bitcoin (BTC) has consistently outshined ether over the past six weeks, evidenced by the ratio's 32% increase since Dec. 8.  While ether (ETH) has declined 45% since then, amid heightened expectations of a U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate increase, bitcoin, despite being considered an inflation hedge and more sensitive to changes in borrowing costs in the traditional economy, has seen a more measured drop of 29%.  The price action counters the narrative that increased institutional participation in bitcoin has made it more vulnerable to macro factors.  The bitcoin-ether ratio has entered the bullish territory above the 200-day moving average. Should the ratio succeed in establishing a foothold above the critical technical line, it would imply a continued bitcoin outperformance in the near term.

42375465,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7uz7,1643111850,Bitcoin Recovers to $36K Amid Mixed Response From Traders; Polkadot Leads Altcoin Gains,"Bitcoin gained 10% in the past 24 hours to trade above $36,500 during European hours on Tuesday, staging a recovery after a plunge on Monday saw prices fall to as low as $33,500.  The move caused a resurgence in the broader crypto market, adding 5% to the $1.7 trillion total market capitalization in the past 24 hours. Several major cryptocurrencies rose as high as 12%, with DOT, SOL and ADA among the biggest gainers.  The recovery in the crypto market comes ahead of a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday, one that’s widely expected to reveal the agency’s stance on a rate hike in March. The Fed previously stated it would tighten monetary policy with up to four rate hikes in 2022 to keep inflation in check, causing a sell-off in asset markets across the globe during the last few months.  Cryptocurrencies have acted as a risk asset in the broader financial market similar to technology stocks. A tightened policy could see investors choose safer assets, which could, in turn, lead to a further drop in cryptocurrency prices.  “Crypto coins and tokens have been shown to be highly sensitive to equity prices, propelled upwards on a wave of cheap and easy money,” explained Susannah Streeter, markets analyst at financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, in a note on Tuesday.  “Hopes that bitcoin would act as an inflation hedge have fast evaporated, losing more than half its value since its November high, as consumer prices have soared,” Streeter added. “There may be speculators waiting in the wings to buy the big dip, but expect the volatility to continue as money liquidity washing around financial markets evaporates.”  Some macro traders say institutional capital in cryptocurrency markets has changed the overall market dynamic, and that it may not see the infamous boom and bust cycles as before.  “The determination of a bull/bear market is not as clear as previous cycles, due to the structure of the market changing drastically with institutions entering the space,” said Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at crypto broker GlobalBlock, in a mail to CoinDesk. “It is apparent that bitcoin is in a ranging environment (between $29,000 to $69,000 approximately) rather than a trending environment.”  Bitcoin (BTC) rose to as high as $37,500 on Monday night before a sell-off to the $35,700 level during Asian morning hours on Tuesday. Prices of the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization are now down 30% in the past month and nearly 50% since May 2021’s peak of $69,000.  Readings from the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a price-chart indicator, for bitcoin hovered at the 50 mark during European hours on Tuesday, recovering from oversold levels of under 30 on Sunday. RSI calculates the magnitude of price movements for assets, with readings below 30 indicating prices of an asset have fallen further than its fundamental value.  Meanwhile, some analysts say Tuesday’s rally could prove to be short-lived for bitcoin investors.  “Rebound in bitcoin and the positive dynamics of the crypto market are more correctly attributed to technical factors: crypto investors are exiting altcoins to more liquid BTC, forming temporary bounces, but nothing more,” shared Alex Kuptsikevich, senior financial analyst at FxPro, in a mail to CoinDesk.  Kuptsikevich added bitcoin could retest 2021’s price lows instead of surging, “The nearest target for BTC downside is $32.3K to close the gap entirely. However, it is worth being prepared to retest the July lows of $29.5K-$30K.”  Further caution is still on the cards for bitcoin investors. “Without support from the stock markets, these levels may not hold for long either,” noted Kuptsikevich.",NEUTRAL,BTC | DOT,ALTCOIN | BTC | DOT | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/25/bitcoin-recovers-to-36k-amid-mixed-response-from-traders-polkadot-leads-altcoin-gains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/87d40aceebb775eecdeae8ffc09865a805e745d9-1627x813.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The report explained that while the Ethereum blockchain was a popular choice due to its security and decentralization, it suffered in its scalability.

The collection also includes clothing worn by John Lennon in the Beatles' films and various guitars given to Julian Lennon by his father. The NFTs take the form of audio-visual collectibles, each accompanied with narration by Julian.  The auction will take place on NFT marketplace YellowHeart on Feb. 7. YellowHeart is a startup that uses Ethereum and Polygon integrations to offer tickets and other music-related items as NFTs. Last March, it hosted the release of Kings of Leon's album as an NFT, a first for a rock band.  NFTs saw a dramatic surge in interest in 2021, with trading volume reaching $10.7 billion in the third quarter, driven by a record-breaking August that saw over $5.2 billion in trading.

On Monday, three attackers were able to take advantage of the bug and buy popular NFTs at older, lower prices, and sell them for a massive profit.  An OpenSea spokesperson told CoinDesk via email that ""this is not an exploit or a bug"" but rather ""an issue that arises because of the nature of the blockchain.""  The marketplace launched a new listing manager early on Tuesday, adding a dashboard that shows all of one user's inactive listings where they can cancel each listing with one click.  ""The fix only handles and solves for new users, as it only fix the facade (web app) and not the vulnerable contract itself,"" said Tal Be'ery, chief technology officer of crypto wallet ZenGo, told CoinDesk via Twitter. ""Old users that re-listed their NFTs on OpenSea in the past are still vulnerable to such attack,"" whereas new users ""simply cannot re-list NFTs without cancelling previous lists explicitly,"" he added.  On top of the new dashboard, OpenSea has been reaching out to and reimbursing affected users, the spokesperson said, adding that they have not ""communicated broadly about this issue"" to avoid bringing it to the attention of bad actors.  OpenSea also changed its default listing duration from six months to one month, and started notifying users if they have an active higher price listing when they reduce the price for the same item, the marketplace told CoinDesk.  In the next two days, OpenSea will ship another two features to address the listing issue, the company said. The first feature is that when a user transfers an NFT out of their wallet for which they have an active listing, OpenSea will notify them that the NFT in question is an active listing, giving the users an option to cancel the transfer. The second feature is to email users when they transfer an NFT into a wallet with an active listing for that NFT.

42375460,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7uxr,1643104272,Ethereum Money Markets See Record Liquidations as Ether Tanks; MakerDAO Revenue Surges,"Ether's recent sell-off has brought pain to some and cheer to others, underscoring the zero-sum nature of trading.  As the cryptocurrency fell by over 14% on Friday, its most significant single-day drop in seven months, it triggered liquidations of collateral locked in prominent Ethereum-based lending and borrowing protocols, also referred to as decentralized money markets. At the same time, some of these decentralized finance (DeFi) applications made a handsome amount of money through liquidation fees.  Ethereum money markets AAVE, Compound and MakerDAO processed a total of $200 million of liquidations on Friday – a record single-day tally – with MakerDAO accounting for more than half, data from Dune Analytics shared by Delphi Digital shows. Typically, these DeFi protocols see less than $10 million of daily liquidations.  Borrowers are liquidated when a crypto crash pushes the collateral's value below the safety threshold. The process is analogous to derivatives exchanges executing a forced closure of long or short positions due to margin shortage.  ""As a major correction sent ETH falling from $3,200 to $2,500 in the past week, on-chain liquidations surged as positions started to hit their liquidation point,"" analysts at Delphi Digital said in Monday's newsletter, adding that MakerDAO has profited from the liquidation event.  MakerDAO collected about $15.5 million in liquidation penalty fees on Friday, according to the official forum. The DeFi protocol has earned $17.5 million in liquidation revenue this month. ""That's multiples more than recent months and surpassed the revenues generated during the May 2021 drawdown,"" Delphi Digital noted.  How MakerDAO works?  MakerDAO, a crypto lending credit facility, issues a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, DAI, that is one of the most widely used coins in the DeFi ecosystem and facilitates collateral-backed loans without an intermediary.  Users put ether as collateral on the Maker platform, opening a vault position to borrow DAI equivalent to a portion of the collateral's value. Borrowers need to pay back the DAI along with the loan interest when they want to withdraw their collateral.  The critical point here is that Maker utilizes over-collateralized lending, meaning the value of ether deposited must be greater than the loan amount. So, a person wanting to borrow 500 DAI, needs to deposit 1.5 times that amount in ETH or any other coin approved by Maker.  The loan becomes unsafe if the collateralization ratio dips below 150%, in which case the borrower can add more collateral, repay DAI, or get liquidated. When liquidation happens, borrowers pay a penalty that is added to their total debt.  The liquidations penalty is calculated as a percentage of the debt. Maker also has a debt ceiling, a mechanism controlling the maximum amount of DAI that can be generated against different collaterals. If the ceiling is hit, users must pay down their existing debt before taking more.  Liquidations and DAI peg  When a position in liquidated, the ETH deposited as collateral is sold for DAI, which is then burned, or destroyed. That puts upward pressure on the price of DAI, helping maintain the 1:1 peg and downward pressure on ether.  Thus, a large number of liquidations can lead to heightened price volatility – an exaggerated slide in the value of the collateral.  On Friday, crypto Twitter panicked as 7-siblings, the second-largest MakerDAO vault owner (or borrower), faced liquidation risk holding $600 million in debt.  In the end, the borrower added more collateral so only $60 million were liquidated from his vault, according to Delphi Digital.  According to a tweet by China journalist Colin Wu, crypto asset management platform Cobo's founder Shixing ""Shenyu"" Mao expects a continued sell-off in ether to $1,900 and below to trigger $600 million in liquidations on MakerDAO.  Ether was recently changing hands near $2,400, having hit a six-month low under $2,200 on Monday, CoinDesk data shows.",NEUTRAL,ETH | DAI,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | MKR | DAI,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/25/ethereum-money-markets-see-record-liquidations-as-ether-tanks-makerdao-revenue-surges,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e796b20e0c2fe8005de43acd004f50b45a5906c3-1920x1019.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417094,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcS0Xmv,1643100148,Tornado Cash Co-Founder Says the Mixer Protocol Is Unstoppable,"The co-founder of Ethereum’s best-known coin mixing service says that privacy protocols are defending people’s rights to financial privacy.  Tornado Cash, a mixer that allows users to obfuscate their digital trail on the Ethereum blockchain, has been at the center of attention since it was revealed last week that hackers were using it to mix stolen ether from digital assets exchange Crypto.com.  In an interview with CoinDesk, co-founder Roman Semenov said the team has little control over what its users do with the protocol as it's designed to be autonomous and outside of the control of developers.  “There is not much we can do in terms of helping investigations because the team doesn't have much control over the protocol,” he told CoinDesk. “The Tornado Cash team mostly does research and publishes the code to GitHub. All the deployments, protocol changes and important decisions are made by the community via Tornado Governance DAO and deployment ceremonies,"" an event when new code is pushed live.  The way the protocol is designed, decentralized and autonomous much like decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, means there’s nobody in charge. There’s no corporate office, executive team or CEO where the buck stops. Semenov said there’s no backend, and the user interface comes from an Ethereum Name Service domain – a service that represents Ethereum addresses as familiar-sounding domain names.  “The protocol was specifically designed this way to be unstoppable, because it wouldn't make much sense if some third party [like developers] would have control over it. This would be the same as if someone had control over Bitcoin or Ethereum,” he told CoinDesk.  Is Tornado Cash part of a criminal conspiracy?  Tornado Cash isn’t the first service to offer users the ability to mix, or tumble, their crypto. These have been around since the beginning of blockchain technology, with development efforts increasing in parallel to the ubiquity of darknet markets like Silk Road or Alpha Bay.  Law enforcement is very familiar with mixers. Bill Callahan, a retired U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency agent and now director of government affairs at the Blockchain Intelligence Group, told CoinDesk in a prior interview that he doesn’t think Tornado Cash is laundering money, equating it to running away from the police and trying to evade capture. But there would be grounds to investigate it as part of the scheme.  “If a mixer knows or maybe should have known, taken steps to know the source of the funds and the beneficial owner, and the funds are from an illicit source, they would be investigated as part of the money-laundering scheme. They could also be charged as an accessory to the crime in a criminal conspiracy,” he told CoinDesk.  In a previous statement to CoinDesk, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) said mixers like Tornado Cash may fall under the definition of a money transmitter, and therefore have “obligations” set by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). But it hasn’t given any further guidance.  With the high-profile takedown of darknet bitcoin mixing service Helix, then-U.S. Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski said that “[obscuring] virtual currency transactions in this way is a crime.”  However, Larry Dean Harmon, the service’s operator, pled guilty and the prosecution never had to prove its case, meaning there isn’t precedent that can say with certainty that this is money laundering.  For its part, Tornado Cash’s Semenov said law enforcement hasn’t been in touch.  “Law enforcement usually knows that the developers don't have any ability to assist with an investigation or change the protocol,” he told CoinDesk.  Instead, Semenov said law enforcement would spend its time obtaining logs from infrastructure providers like Cloudflare or Infura, as these could be tied to IP addresses. Law enforcment would also likely look at any addresses linked to a centralized crypto exchange, where the wallet would have customer details linked to it via the know-your-customer (KYC) process.  “Law enforcement very rarely tries to contact us directly,” he said.  Privacy vs. security  Semenov downplayed any ideas that the protocol is a tool for criminals and said it's an important mechanism to protect the safety of crypto traders as the blockchain reveals everything for all to see.  “Since all their crypto portfolio is visible to the public, the holders of significant amounts of crypto are very vulnerable to becoming victims of kidnapping, torture and blackmail,” Semenov told CoinDesk in an interview. “We think that it's a very serious threat, and the privacy protocols are very important to ensure their personal safety. The banks don't disclose your personal holdings to anyone who asks, and we think it should be the same way with crypto.”  Semenov said the debate about the limits of digital privacy isn’t anything new. It has always flared up any time new encryption technology has become available to retail users.  “In the 1990s, the government claimed that no strong encryption should be available to people at all, arguing that it would help terrorism,” he said. “In the late 2000s, there was a similar fight over end-to-end encryption in messengers where people were defending their right to private communication.”  Now, in the 2010s and 2020’s, crypto is this latest frontier, and Semenov said his efforts in defending people’s right to financial privacy are the “continuation of the same story that started a long time ago.”  He added, “Can you imagine the world where the cypherpunks conceded from the start and we wouldn't even have HTTPS encryption of our web communications?”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | REGULATION | ENS,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/25/tornado-cash-co-founder-says-the-mixer-protocol-is-unstoppable,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b1326603a0910f65145e93b0df76eadfe1ab9ec-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375450,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7ulH,1643098580,Fantom Transactions Surpass Ethereum as Users Look to Farm Yields,"Transactions on Fantom exceeded those of Ethereum for the first time ever on Monday as investors seek newer avenues to farm yields and accrue value.  In the past 24 hours, over 1.2 million transactions were processed on the Fantom network, data from blockchain tracker Fantomscan showed. This was slightly higher than Ethereum’s 1.1 million transactions, as per data from Ethereum tracker Etherscan.  With 55 validators maintaining the network, Fantom processed upward of eight transactions per second (tps) on Monday compared to Ethereum’s current rates of under 2 tps, data showed. Ethereum transactions are now at August 2021 levels, far below the May 2021 peak of 1.7 million daily transactions.  Fantom has now recorded a total of over 170 million transactions since its launch in December 2019, a fraction of Ethereum’s 1.4 billion transactions since its inception in 2015.  However, Monday’s figures on Fantom were still lower than all-time high transaction counts of 1.8 million in September 2021, a month before FTM tokens reached a price peak of $3.46.  Tokens of Fantom have emerged as the top performers in recent months as investors bet on the tokens of layer 1 projects – protocols with their native blockchains, such as Fantom or Solana – as an alternate to Ethereum.  Fantom became the third-largest decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem by locked value over the weekend, as reported. It started 2022 at the eighth spot in rankings but has since climbed to the third spot amid increasing developer activity and user interest for products built over Fantom.  DeFi refers to financial services, such as trading, lending and borrowing, that rely on smart contracts instead of third parties. Over $12.2 billion worth of value is locked on 129 Fantom-based DeFi applications as of Monday.  Why are transactions increasing?  Analysts say newer products and high yield rewards are fueling growth on the Fantom network. “Many projects like Radial, veDAO, and 0xDAO came up with liquidity mining launches that vampire-attacked other protocols to gain TVL. These projects share a lot of resemblance to ['DeFi summer'] projects in 2020,” wrote crypto research firm Delphi Digital in a note on Tuesday. Liquidity mining refers to users supplying liquidity to DeFi applications and receiving rewards for doing so.  “Mercenary capital came over to Fantom to farm these projects as they were providing incredible yields on single-sided staking,” the analysts cautioned, suggesting current activity could be short-lived as yields fall and investors exit to wherever more yields are on offer.  For now, FTM traders are rejoicing. The token was among top gainers in Asian hours on Tuesday, its price rising 8% to $2.30 in the past 24 hours. However, there was some profit taking, with prices falling 7 cents at the time of writing.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/25/fantom-transactions-surpass-ethereum-as-users-look-to-farm-yields,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c723f2e88a542b26025734a1121f11fc2d1116a4-1200x1100.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Will the zone halt the downfall or succumb under selling pressure? Solana is a very efficient open-source project which focuses on the permissionless nature of blockchain technology to provide decentralized financial (DeFi) options. The concept and the initial development started in 2017. SOL was officially launched in March 2020 by the Solana Foundation with headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. The protocol was designed to make it easier for decentralized application (DApp) development. Its goal is to increase the scaling by introducing a proof-of-history (PoH) consensus.

Tornado Cash is a ETH mixer protocol that promises to improve transaction privacy by obscuring the on-chain link between the source and recipient of ether.  The protocol launched in early 2020.  On-chain data first spotted by security consultancy Peck Shield suggests that the 4,600 ether is being sent through the mixer in batches of 100 ether.  While some say that mixer protocols, or cryptocurrency tumblers, are used to protect the privacy of activists or other politically exposed individuals, they are often used to launder the proceeds of organized crime.  In a previous statement to CoinDesk, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) said that mixers like Tornado Cash may fall under the definition of a money transmitter, and therefore have “obligations” set by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).  Law enforcement has previously shut down other mixers such as Bestmixer, which was raided by European Union authorities in 2019, and Helix, which was shut down by the FBI in 2021 for laundering Darknet funds.  Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm previously told CoinDesk in an interview that the protocol works with regulators to assuage their fears. Version 2 of Tornado Cash includes a cryptographic note in the transaction history of ether send through its pipes that can be used to determine fund provenance.  “We are in a little bit of a different situation [than other mixer wallets]. I think for us it’s very important to become compliant,” Storm previously told CoinDesk. “We do what we feel is right.”  Tornado Cash’s TORN token is up almost 9% during the Asia trading day to $33.31, according to CoinGecko.

While some panicked and sold, others took advantage of the situation and purchased the dips. Nonetheless, the crypto meltdown became the talk of the town and grabbed all the headlines, in what is being considered as a preview of how the crypto bubble may burst someday. Bitcoin and most other Altcoins have been falling in value as crypto investors anticipate the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates faster and more aggressively than most had predicted only a few months ago. If we look at the numbers, since the November peak, Bitcoin has lost more than $600 billion in market value, and the total crypto market has lost more than $1 trillion. With investors confused over whether to buy the dip or not, few crypto influencers are still having high bullish development in the market. WazirX CEO, Nischal Shetty is one of them and he took to Twitter to tell crypto-traders that the best crypto projects are still to come. Bear Times Brings The Best Bulls in the Market Nischal Shetty said that the industry is always building during the bear moments just like it makes money during the bullish trends.

The BSN-Distributed Digital Certificate (BSN-DDC) network is a structure for building NFTs that is compliant with Chinese regulations, the organization said in a press release. Authorities in China discourage public networks like Ethereum that are commonly used in the NFT ecosystem.  Instead, as CoinDesk reported in October, BSN is making 10 Open Permissioned Blockchains available on the BSN-DDC. These are localized versions of their permissionless counterparts that set restrictions on who can participate in network governance and use fiat currency for payment. DDCs are the same as NFTs, but renamed to emphasize their uses for certification.  Five of the 10 chains were named: Ethereum-based Wuhan Chain, Wenchang Chain powered by Cosmos-based IRISnet, Corda-based Zunyi Chain, EOS-based Zhongyi Chain, and FISCO BCOS-based Tai'an Chain.  Some platform partners were also announced: The state-owned museum and auction house Rong Bao Zhai Auction, state-backed Hainan International Culture and Artworks Exchange Center – which has acquired the first license for an NFT marketplace in China, consulting firm EY's blockchain division, video technology provider Sumavison, electronic invoice provider Baiwang and Digital Art Fair Asia, an NFT-focused company from Hong Kong.  Another 26 founding partners, as well as the roadmap and governance structure will be announced in a launch ceremony in the city of Nanjing in March.  The BSN-DDC is based on the Blockchain Services Network, a platform where developers can build and deploy decentralized applications at a low cost.
