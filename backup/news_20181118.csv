42402211,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3fPh,1542542457,Huobi Exchange's Plans for Russia Go Well Beyond Crypto Trading,"Huobi, the third-largest crypto exchange by trading volumes, is seeking to fill a void in Russia's cryptocurrency community.  This month, the exchange opened an office in Moscow, the first major crypto trading platform to have a physical presence in the country, notably with a Russian-language call center. But Singapore-based Huobi's ambitions go further, into lending and renting space for Russian miners, shaping the country's regulations and training local blockchain talent.  The call center alone may be a significant differentiator, however. Even though leading crypto exchanges like Binance, OKEx and Bitfinex now have Russian-language interfaces, getting real-time support in case of tech problems have been a headache for many users in Russia who don’t speak English, Chinese or Korean.  “None of the big exchanges would answer your request in Russian,” a Russian trader named Anton, who didn’t want to disclose his full name, told CoinDesk.  For several years, the void was filled by the now-defunct exchange BTC-e, which had not only a Russian support staff but a network of local over-the-counter (OTC) dealers who had been facilitating the purchases of cryptocurrencies in absence of regulated fiat on-ramps in the country.  But BTC-e was shut down by the U.S. FBI in July 2017. Subsequently, a new platform named WEX picked up its job until July, when fiat and crypto withdrawals were frozen.  Since then, there has been no mainstream platform offering comprehensive support for users in Russia. So now Huobi is stepping in aggressively.  Concierge service  Huobi's 30-person Moscow office opened November 12. In addition to the call center, this site provides back office support for OTC trading and listing, and personal managers for big clients, Andrew Grachev, the head of the Russian office, told CoinDesk.  ""If someone wants to start trading with $1,000, he can come to the office and register with the help of a personal manager,"" Grachev said.  To attract as many new users as possible, Huobi Russia is offering commissions lower than 0.1 percent for users who trade more than 50 bitcoin in two weeks during November, the company's website says. Also, users will get a monthly “cash back” reward, Grachev said: 20 percent of trading fees users pay on the exchange will come back to their account in the form of Huobi tokens, which then can be used on the platform to pay for services, or cashed out.  Initially, Huobi's plans were even more ambitious: the exchange wanted to enable deposits in Russian roubles, but the local experts said it's a bad idea.  ""They consulted with us a lot, and in the end, I think, we made them feel disappointed,"" Vladimir Demin, head of the Center of Digital Transformations at the Russian government-owned development bank Vnesheconombank (VEB), told CoinDesk. ""They were interested in providing fiat operations, but we told them it's impossible.""  However, Russian users will be able to buy cryptocurrency for roubles using the exchange's Huobi OTC service, and seamlessly transfer it to their trading accounts, Grachev told CoinDesk. The OTC platform is online, but it has too few users from Russia so far, so Huobi plans to lure local OTC traders with commission rates lower than on other OTC platforms, Grachev said.  Regulatory consulting  With three bills related to blockchain, cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) currently stuck in the Russian parliament, the State Duma, the local regulatory environment is unclear and arguably unconducive to the industry's growth.  However, government-backed institutions are watching the field closely and launching various local blockchain pilots for government services, like distribution of government-sponsored prescription drugs or land registry.  ""We started from projects on blockchain without using tokens or cryptocurrencies,"" Demin said. ""But we understand that using this technology only in a non-token way is like jumping half-way over the abyss.""  In August, Huobi signed up with the VEB's Center of Digital Transformations and has been providing expertise that will be adapted for Russia by local experts and used in the development of future regulation in the country, Demin said.  ""We were looking at this field and Huobi came out as the most suitable partner as they are already working with the governments of Australia, Singapore, China,"" he said, adding:  ""We are consulting the Bank of Russia and State Duma to add some practical elements to those bills.""  Further expansion  In addition to opening the Moscow office, Huobi will train blockchain entrepreneurs attending a special program for blockchain startups at Plekhanov University of Economics, one of the top Russian universities.  The university is in the process of finalizing a contract with Huobi, Nadezhda Surova, head of the University’s Department of Entrepreneurship and Logistics, told CoinDesk.  Initially, Huobi came to the university in search of tech professionals, she said, and later an expert committee within the Russian government’s Ministry of Digital Development approved the partnership.  Huobi’s further plans in Russia include offering loans for miners to buy specialized mining chips, or ASICs, and space for them to rent, Grachev said. According to him, these services might become available as soon as the first quarter of 2019.  Coming to Russia is a part of larger expansion plans by Huobi: in August, the exchange announced plans to open offices in the Philippines, Russia, Taiwan, Indonesia, and Canada, South China Morning Post reported.  According to CoinMarketCap, Huobi's total 24-hour volume (excluding no-fee trades and transaction mining) is $595 million, making it No. 3 among exchanges after Binance and OKEx.

42402209,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3fQg,1542540614,Deloitte Blockchain Chief: Bad Crypto Headlines Making Clients ‘Nervous’,"“Can we stop talking about my bad brother?”  That’s how Linda Pawczuk, leader of Deloitte Consulting’s financial services industry blockchain group, describes the conversations she often has these days with executives and board members of client companies.  Pawczuk’s team is squarely focused on helping decades-old, global enterprises figure out how to use distributed ledger technology (DLT) to transform their paper-based business processes for a digital age. But recently, she said, these clients have been asking about the wilder side of blockchain they’ve read about in the news: the initial coin offerings (ICOs) that have incurred the wrath of the Securities and Exchange Commission, for example, or the illicit uses of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  She told CoinDesk:  “The boards are asking us about it because it’s in the news for bad actors, and boards are nervous that blockchain is affiliated with bitcoin and altcoins and ICOs, and what do boards do to protect their investors? So it hasn’t helped us, the association with the bad actors.”  Pawczuk wryly added that her team at Deloitte sometimes refers to ICOs as “the donor market,” meaning that the investors are not going to get their money back.  While it’s good that regulators are cracking down, she said, the hype creates a distraction.  “Unfortunately we got those things that create angst,” Pawczuk went on. “I’m invited to the meetings all the time, and I have to explain why they shouldn’t be concerned about the security of information [on a blockchain], explain what is the perspective on bitcoin and the 2,000 altcoins — and we’re explaining this, but we’re like, ‘Can we stop talking about my bad brother? Can we start talking about my brother who is the Olympic champion?’”  That Olympic champion, in her analogy, is DLT.  In a wide-ranging interview, Pawczuk, who took over her team at Deloitte in April after predecessor Eric Piscini left to form a blockchain startup, shared her perspectives on what kind of consortiums work best in getting enterprises to adopt this tech; why she’s queasy about vendors offering free proofs-of-concept; why Deloitte isn’t pursuing any work in the hot stablecoin sector; and whether she sees public chains playing any role at enterprises.  Which consortia work  Stepping back, Pawczuk spends most of her time working with what she calls “digital shift” companies — enterprises that “have been existing for hundred of years, some of them, but grew up in traditional process models and decided to migrate to more distributed technologies.”  To rally such companies around DLT, Pawczuk believes, it’s best to use a consortium that has already built a reputation as a neutral party over many years, not one created specifically to develop and promote a technical platform.  She has an example ready: The Institutes RickBlock Alliance, whose formation Pawczuk oversaw in her previous job, when she led Deloitte’s blockchain efforts in the insurance sector for three years. In this case, the focal point was the Institutes, an insurance industry group that’s been around for more than a century.  “The Institutes has for many decades serviced the property and casualty insurance industry, they are non-profit, and it’s a very trusted entity. You don’t have to create trust, and you have membership already,” Pawczuk said.  Using The Institutes to set up RiskBlock, it was easy to sign up 30 insurance companies as members, she said. The blockchain is in production and now the alliance is eyeing expanding beyond North America.  Such structures, Pawczuk argued, have an advantage in that unlike Hyperledger or R3, they are not invested in pushing a particular technology.  “Hyperledger has a horse in the race‚ it’s a platform. R3 is trying to bring different parties together and get them to agree on something for the sole purpose of blockchain. There are consortium plays where the trusted party already exists, as opposed to manufacturing a trusted party for the sole purpose of transaction.”  So does that mean that, for example, SWIFT, the international financial messaging service that’s been around since the 1970s, would be an ideal vehicle for organizing a blockchain used by banks and corporates?  “Maybe,” Pawczuk said. “They are already the intermediary. They’re already providing the abundance of the capabilities required, including a set of standards, that the industries have already come together to agree to.”  To be fair, RiskBlock is using R3’s Corda platform — but, according to Pawczuk, the project has been blockchain-agnostic from the start and put as its first priority bringing the insurers on board.  A consortium should not be interested in gaining profits out of its membership, Pawczuk said. “When a consortium or an influencer is forming, they are looking for ways to monetize the data, to monetize the service. You can’t be a neutral party and also focus on an economic model that is self-serving. It’s just replacing an intermediary with another intermediary.”  Free stuff  For similar reasons, Pawczuk is skeptical about the practice among some enterprise blockchain vendors of building proofs of concept for free.  “The more interesting story here isn’t the technology, it’s business model disruption and how do we look differently at paradigms,” she said. “So we get a little bit queasy when we hear about all these free proofs of concept that’s being built, because it’s the technology being applied to the solution.”  Rather, the business requirements should determine the technology.  “If you’re building free proofs of concept, but you’re missing the business context around it, like regulatory, AML/KYC, tax and all the other stuff, you really aren’t servicing the client holistically,” Pawczuk went on, without naming names. “Another thing that makes me nervous is proofs-of-concepts being built by students that have never had to coexist in the environment where large high volume transaction systems do exist. Blockchain does not replace all core systems.”  Asked about the recent trend of creating stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies designed to maintain parity with fiat, Pawczuk said Deloitte is not doing any work in the area, and sounded uninterested in pursuing it. (At least one of its competitors among the Big Four, PwC, is advising two separate stablecoin projects.)  But aren’t stablecoins an opportunity for firms whose core competency is auditing, given that these assets are typically backed by fiat in a bank account and investors would want reassurance that the money is there?  Pacwczuk replied that it’s way too soon to go there without regulatory clarity.  “Auditors are going to follow the regulators. Period,” she said. “And the regulators are moving at a respectable pace, because we now we have to figure out something we have never dealt with before: the auditability of decentralized systems.”  Public and private  But even if Deloitte isn’t pursuing any stablecoin projects, that doesn’t mean its core business is steering clear of crypto. The firm is said to be doing system and organization controls (SOC) audits for a number of crypto custody solutions.  Further, while Deloitte’s blockchain consulting mostly involves permissioned blockchains, rather than the open kind that power cryptocurrencies, Pawczuk believes in the end, industries will need a hybrid of both.  “Let’s look at the insurance model,” she said by way of example. “Let’s say you and I are in a vehicle accident, and you have one carrier, I have another carrier, and carriers can settle, but what about that other guy there that’s called a body shop? He’s not necessarily in the permissioned blockchain, because there are thousands of body shops, but could he be on the public network? So now you have a hybrid structure.”  The key to such a structure will be making sure these systems can talk to each other. “I’m less concerned about the actual DLT layer, I’m more concerned about the interoperable system layer, because there is the whole set of services and middleware that make this whole stack function,” Pawczuk said.  Another rival, Accenture, recently announced a so-called “interoperability node”, designed to connect the main enterprise blockchains: R3 Corda; Hyperledger Fabric; Quorum, developed by global bank JPMorgan Chase; and Digital Asset. But Deloitte has staked out its own blockchain interoperability claim, connecting trade finance blockchain data, as demoed in May at Consensus 2018.  And despite the distractions created by crypto’s turbulence, Pawczuk gave credit to the predecessor of all the blockchain systems being built now, concluding:  “The fact that bitcoin is a real use case landed global appeal, got people to focus on blockchain. We would never be talking about process capabilities like blockchain, and the disruption of blockchain, had it not been for bitcoin.”  Linda Pawczuk photo via Deloitte.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TOKEN SALE,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2018/11/18/deloitte-blockchain-chief-bad-crypto-headlines-making-clients-nervous,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9658457a7a0c063f36bd80b79abc3362a558ca01-1919x1077.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
