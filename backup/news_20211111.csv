FTX US&apos; user count surged 52% quarter-over-quarter, increased its headcount by 30%, and held about 4.5% of the U.S. crypto spot market&apos;s volume by September 30th, a 2% increase compared to the beginning of the quarter. The company has reached a total value of $25 billion.

We will continue to improve our existing offerings and rapidly expand into new areas, including derivatives, NFTs, and payment services.

42396545,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT496g,1636673400,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin in $65K Range as Trading Volume Slows,"Good morning, Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market moves: Bitcoin recovered from Wednesday’s dip to near $64K as trading slowed from earlier in the week.  Technician’s take: Upside momentum is starting to slow, especially given recent overbought signals on the charts.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $65,140  Ether (ETH): $4,741  Market moves  Bitcoin spent most of Thursday ranging around $65,000 during U.S. trading hours as the markets slowly digested a highly volatile trading day on Wednesday, when bitcoin dropped to near $64,000. At the time of publication, bitcoin was up slightly over the past 24 hours. Ether was above $4,700, a nearly 3% gain.  Bitcoin’s spot trading volume across centralized exchanges tracked by CoinDesk was much lower on Thursday compared with Wednesday, as bitcoin slowly recovered to above $65,000.  Markets have remained bullish, despite the centralized exchanges that offer bitcoin futures liquidating roughly $133 million in long positions when bitcoin started dropping from a record high of $68,990.90 on Wednesday, according to data from trading data site Coinglass.  “The general upwards trend isn’t broken, so we will probably climb back up to the all-time high again,” Andrew Tu, an executive at quantitative trading firm Efficient Frontier, told CoinDesk, citing bullish technical analysis.  Others pointed out Taproot, the most significant upgrade to the Bitcoin blockchain’s protocol in years, could further push up the underlying currency’s price. The Taproot upgrade is likely to take place this coming weekend or early next week.  Bitcoin’s “price has no doubt been supported by the upcoming Taproot upgrade,” Singapore-based trading firm QCP Capital, wrote in its Telegram channel on Wednesday. “This is the largest upgrade since SegWit in 2017 and will improve a whole string of key functions. ... We are keeping long bitcoin into this major event.”  Technician’s take  Bitcoin Could Find Support at $56K-$60K  Bitcoin (BTC) buyers took some profits after the cryptocurrency reached an all-time price high near $68,950 on Wednesday. The cryptocurrency is roughly flat over the past 24 hours and could find lower support around the $56,000-$60,000 price range.  Upside momentum is starting to slow, especially given recent overbought signals on the charts. This suggests BTC’s pullback could extend into Asian trading hours, although buyers will likely return around $60,000.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is at the highest level since Oct. 20, which preceded a near-10% drop in BTC’s price.  Further, BTC’s recent all-time price high occurred on lower trading volume and a weaker RSI reading, which means additional buying activity could be limited over the short term.

42396528,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT48px,1636669786,"More Firms Embracing the Metaverse and Gaming Stocks Have Already Benefited, Morgan Stanley Says","The metaverse is important because it can “fundamentally change the medium through which we socialize with others, watch music performances, engage with fashion brands, learn and/or speculate on digital assets such as [non-fungible tokens] or in-game skins,” Morgan Stanley said in a research note.  The metaverse does exist but not yet in its “purest form,” equity strategist Edward Stanley said in the report published Thursday.  Companies such as Roblox, Facebook and Naver are all currently building metaverses on their own company platforms, but a “true metaverse” would allow for “interoperability between experiences” across all these companies’ platforms. However, it will take some time and “cross-company collaboration to allow users to seamlessly move across millions of experiences,” the report said.  South Korea is seen as an important hub because its over 400 technology companies could deliver interoperability between metaverses in the future, the report noted.  The report described the metaverse as a “virtual world for immersive co-experiences that is persistently available and where users can explore vast numbers of experiences concurrently,” and “within these experiences, people across the world can meet, play, watch, trade and learn across millions of experiences.”  The target audience for the metaverse at present is young gamers, observed the report, but noted the average age is rising, and it can be accessed over phone or PC gaming platforms.  The metaverse is already moving the share prices for gaming stocks such as Roblox, the bank said. More companies are embracing the concept, it added.  Facebook said in October that it was planning to hire 10,000 people in the European Union to develop its metaverse. The social media company also changed its corporate name to Meta at that time.

42376293,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6A4Sb,1636669675,How Blockchain Technology Is Transforming Microtransactions and Revitalizing the Gaming Industry,"Microtransactions are a staple of many modern video games, to the point that many have just accepted them. Thanks to blockchain technology, however, new models are emerging that stand to disrupt the norm. Play-to-earn video games are growing in popularity, and new services are lowering the cost of entry. These innovations are set to become the catalyst to create a true vision of the coming metaverse.  A new play-to-earn structure  Modern video games are rife with microtransactions. Whether simple things like costumes or accessories, or more elaborate offerings like characters and weapons, these in-game purchases have largely divided the gaming community. When done right, they can offer new content at a fair price, but when abused, they lead to “loot crates” and a general “pay-to-win” mentality. That creates artificial pay barriers to success for those who can’t simply throw money at a game they have already bought. Furthermore, any money sunk into a specific title is lost entirely when the player moves on.  With the rise of blockchain-based gaming and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), however, this is all changing. A new gaming model is emerging based around real asset ownership and a new “play-to-earn” structure. A prime example is Axie Infinity, a play-to-earn NFT-based online game that has galvanized user interest worldwide, becoming the No. 1 decentralized app (dapp) in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem.  This revolution in gaming is being called “GameFi.” GameFi encompasses the ideals that gamers shouldn’t just throw money away on in-game content, but instead invest their resources in assets that can appreciate in value and be resold on secondary markets.  NFT technology makes that possible, and the underlying blockchains provide the means for gamers to earn currencies that have real-world value. That has led to a new, all-digital economy, one that not only rewards users for their engagement, but offers financial services that make gaming a potentially lucrative way to generate income.  A new type of paywall  Of course, it often takes money to make money. Many of these games, while offering real avenues for value creation, also have some form of “buy-in” price, an initial payment for either an in-game NFT item or tokens, crucial to the play-to-earn mechanism. Unfortunately, not all newcomers have deep pockets to get involved, leading to a similar situation as the “pay-to-win” model. Consider Axie Infinity. The Pokémon-style game has players battling their “Axies” for a chance to win actual rewards. To begin, however, users need at least three of these virtual creatures. Unfortunately, they aren’t cheap, as each one costs a current minimum of $70 on the Axie marketplace, resulting in a grand total of $210 for newcomers to get started. That is cost prohibitive for many who would like to get involved.  Fortunately, there are innovative approaches being developed to foster greater involvement. For example, new gaming guilds, such as Yield Guild Games in the Philippines, lend assets like Axies to new gamers in exchange for a cut of the gamers’ profits. That means those with lesser means can get involved immediately, and those with more means can earn a passive income. This is a great example of a way that this new virtual economy can benefit players at multiple levels, and inclusivity is going to be essential for building what is becoming known as the metaverse.  Blockchain gaming and the metaverse  If you aren’t familiar with the metaverse, the term is basically the name for the collection of digital services and worlds that are becoming increasingly interconnected and interoperable. It is an ambitious vision, and many traditional platforms struggle to offer true compatibility, meaning various grafted-on systems must be used.  Fortunately, blockchain makes that issue far more trivial. NFTs and other decentralized assets can be transferred seamlessly across multiple platforms as long as they connect to a blockchain. Furthermore, the digital currencies being used stand to become ubiquitous forms of virtual cash that can plausibly be used on virtually any future service. This then stands to build a fully functioning economy that essentially lives in cyberspace, revolutionizing the way gamers interact with their favorite titles, with each other and with the larger economy.  To that end, this new ecosystem stands to have very real benefits to users worldwide. The ability to earn income and explore an immense world of entertainment will come from one, admittedly vast, access point. That will undo many existing paradigms for how value is created and transferred, but the basic infrastructure is being built now.  There’s still work to do  As both empowering and lucrative as all of this may sound, there is definitely still work to be done. For one, developers must still balance things like the kinds of items that are available for purchase, how they may enhance the experience for players and how they interact with other games and markets. If unchecked, there could still be a pay-to-win issue present, an issue blockchain doesn’t fundamentally affect.  What could address the issue is making sure certain items can be equipped only after the user reaches a certain level or otherwise qualifies. For example, metadata baked into an NFT could define an item of clothing or a weapon as usable only when the owner has met specific progression requirements. This means gamers would still be free to buy and trade any item, but a newcomer with deep pockets couldn’t just purchase their way up the ranks. This is just one example, but highlights that the issue isn’t insurmountable.  Another possible stumbling block is that many existing blockchains simply aren’t ready for the transaction volume that the proposed system would require. Gamers aren’t going to want to wait around for transfers to complete over several minutes or more. Transfers need to be resolved on-chain in seconds.  That, of course, could be mitigated by choosing the correct underlying network to build upon. For example, the Polygon Network acts as a second-layer system for the Ethereum blockchain and offers incredibly cheap transactions that take only seconds to complete. That is why Polygon has five times more gaming and NFT dapps than any other chain outside of Ethereum do and why Polygon is already working with a majority of today’s blockchain-based Web 3.0 games and NFT platforms, such as Decentraland, OpenSea and The Sandbox.  Ultimately, it is clear that not only are gamers expecting a new model, but also that blockchain and NFT-powered gaming offers such a model. Progress has been a bit slow, but more developers are beginning to take note, and it won’t be long before the first “killer app” is released.

42396544,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT494i,1636669540,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Stabilizes as Traders Prepare for Taproot Upgrade,"Bitcoin (BTC) is stabilizing after yesterday’s pullback from an all-time high near $68,950. Analysts continue to expect further upside for cryptocurrencies despite short-term price swings.  “Volatile price moves are always around the corner,” Nicholas Cawley, an analyst at DailyFX, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “Longer-term traders in BTC and [ether] ETH may use this recent sell-off to build their positions as sentiment going forward remains positive,” Cawley wrote.  Other analysts pointed to the upcoming Bitcoin blockchain Taproot upgrade as a bullish event for BTC’s price.  “The Taproot upgrade will likely be activated by the end of this week or early next week,” crypto trading firm QCP Capital wrote in a Telegram announcement. “This is the largest upgrade since SegWit in 2017 and will improve a whole string of key functions,” QCP wrote. The firm is holding onto long BTC positions into the network upgrade event.  Read more: An Investor’s Perspective on the Bitcoin Taproot Upgrade  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $65,845, -1.66%  Ether (ETH): $4,737, +2.07%  S&P 500: $4,649, +0.05%  Gold: $1,863, +0.77%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.57%  Meanwhile, at Coinbase, the exchange’s trading desk continues to have higher volumes. “Although this behavior is quite common each time we approach [cryptocurrency] record highs, the current rally feels less mania driven and more supported by fundamentals, such as the Taproot upgrade, and genuine demand from investors,” the exchange wrote in a newsletter to institutional clients this week.  SHIB continues to dominate Coinbase exchange volume market share at 18.16%, while ETH and BTC are at 12.7% and 10.85%, respectively.  Bitcoin long liquidations  Approximately $64 million of long BTC positions were liquidated within two hours of bitcoin’s all-time price high near $69,000 on Wednesday, according to data compiled by Glassnode.  As traders began to take some profits, BTC’s price dropped toward the $63,000 price level. The sell-off appeared to be fueled by a reduction in leveraged positions.  Ether bullish option activity  Options traders are overwhelmingly bullish on ether after the cryptocurrency reached an all-time price high around $4,800 on Wednesday. The chart below shows the largest amount of open interest at the $5,000 ETH strike price, followed by $10,000 and $15,000.  Some analysts maintain high price targets for ether this year. “We continue to expect ETH to outperform and to reach our price target of $10,500,” FundStrat, a global advisory firm, wrote in a newsletter this week.  Open interest is the total amount of outstanding contracts that have not been settled. Call options provide the holder with the right to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price until a defined expiration date. Currently, ETH call options significantly outweigh put options (a bearish position providing the right to sell) across higher expiries.

42396547,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT498e,1636665836,"Bitcoin Retreats From All-Time High, Ether Follows","Bitcoin’s price is down 5% in the last 24 hours after peaking at an all-time high of around $68,950 on Wednesday.  Bitcoin’s all-time high was reached just after the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed higher-than-expected inflation in October. The U.S. Department of Labor said in the report that the CPI rose 6.2% in October versus 12 months prior, the fastest pace in three decades.  At 21:00 UTC on Wednesday, the price of bitcoin dropped to $62,000, just a few hours after trading at around $68,950, representing a 10% decline.  The shakeout appeared to coincide with a turn lower in U.S. stock markets as analysts digested the CPI report, according to IntoTheBlock’s Juan Pellicer.  “The S&P 500 and Nasdaq reacted badly to the announcement,” said Pellicer. This then influenced the crypto market, he said.  In a report early Thursday, Lennard Neo of Stack Funds wrote that the delayed market reaction in stocks and bitcoin might have stemmed from an end-of-day assessment that faster inflation might trigger a quicker response from the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy.  As signaled by CoinDesk earlier this week, a more hawkish tilt at the U.S. central bank might put downward pressure on prices of riskier assets.  What is the relationship between bitcoin and stocks?  The chart below shows the closing price of the U.S. stock indexes, alongside BTC and ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over a seven-day period. The chart shows the bearish reaction – ultimately, by the end of the day – to the inflation announcement.  According to CoinDesk data, the 90-day correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500 has increased from around zero in June – signaling no real relationship – to about 0.3% now, representing a slightly positive price relationship.  Laurent Kssis, director of CEC Capital, said he is seeing a lot of demand for BTC on the back of the price drop late Wednesday.  According to Kssis, reasons for the drop are unclear, but it was exacerbated by liquidations of long trading positions.  Ether price, ADA price, SOL price  Ether also reached an all-time high Wednesday, hitting $4,851. At press time, it was down 2% on the day.  Ether is up 35% on the month so far.  “I believe that ETH will outperform BTC towards year end,” said Daniel Kukan, senior cryptocurrency trader at Swiss-based Crypto Finance AG.  Other smart-contract tokens in the green include Solana’s SOL token, which is up 2% in the last 24 hours, trading at $241, just shy of its all-time high reached Nov. 6.

42424309,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2n5zh,1636659615,European Commission Urges Members to Agree on Crypto Regulations,"The European Commission, the executive branch that proposes legislation for the European Union, is urging its members to agree on its proposed Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations this autumn, according to statements by the EU commissioner for financial services during a web forum Wednesday.  Commissioner Mairead McGuinness said that the commission is also hoping to finalize its proposed regulatory sandbox for financial products based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) by the end of the year.  “Crypto assets are evolving fast, enabling homegrown firms to enter the market, while also attracting retail investors,” McGuinness said. ”It is our policy and our duty as policy makers to put sound rules in place as quickly as possible.”  The tight deadlines underscore EU regulators’ more urgent pace than their U.S. counterparts in developing a sweeping regulatory framework for crypto assets. Only last week, U.S. regulators released their first recommendations for regulating stablecoins or cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of other assets like the U.S. dollar. Meanwhile, McGuinness said that MiCA is introducing a “bespoke regime” for previously unregulated crypto assets, including stablecoins.  While some critics fear that MiCA’s hyper-focus on stablecoin issuers may drive innovation from the region, the commission said that proposed legislation in the framework will make it easier for crypto companies to expand through the EU via a licensing system that allows firms regulated in one member state to start operating in others.  Despite McGuinness’ call to action, Eva Maydell, a member of the EU Parliament, said on Wednesday during a webinar that there are still open questions concerning MiCA. While the European Commission supports the interests of the EU as a whole, the European parliament directly represents the citizens of the union.  Maydell warned it will “take a bit longer than planned” to finalize a position on the framework, although she did not specify a timeline. “But we have to make clear that we don’t want to ban businesses in that particular sphere,” Maydell said.  Meanwhile, the DLT pilot regime will create a safe space for market players to experiment with issuing, trading and settling securities using blockchain technology, McGuinness said.  EU parliamentarian Eva Kaili, who reports on the proposed DLT regime, said during an interview with CoinDesk that the provisions in the proposed regime “will operate in a uniform manner across the EU just like what MiCA is trying to do for crypto assets.”  McGuinness said on Wednesday that the sandbox will run for five years, and at the end of that period, regulators will decide on reviewing the legislation to ensure it is “fostering responsible innovation.”  McGuinness is hopeful that the Commission will agree on the pilot regime by the end of the year. “So as of next year, market participants will be able to test the use of DLT on a large scale in asset classes such as shares on bonds,” McGuinness said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/11/european-commission-urges-member-states-to-agree-on-crypto-regulations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/279be5fe4b02b26eb8622d51595135dcb29cdb55-1024x682.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421694,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXp9Uz,1636659234,‘Probably Nothing’: Why People Still Hate Crypto,"It ended pretty much the same way it began, with a tweet. Discord founder and CEO Jason Citron yesterday went to reassure users that the popular messaging platform will not be integrating crypto after all. This comes after a period of public backlash, where users threatened to or shared screenshots of deactivating their paid Nitro memberships, over the possibility that Discord would lean into crypto.  Earlier this week, over Twitter, Citron seemed to suggest that someone at Discord was working on Ethereum functionality. A screenshot showed MetaMask and WalletConnect, a tool used by many mobile crypto wallets, among the possible integrations alongside existing YouTube, Reddit and Facebook widgets.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  “Probably nothing,” Citron said, the ironic phrase used by crypto enthusiasts to say something is a big deal. Indeed, it would be something. People read into the comment that Discord might soon add native tooling useful for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Already the chosen home for many Web 3 projects, it seemed like Discord was joining the decentralized legion.  But not everyone was pleased with this potential new direction – a move that would reflect changing consumer behavior and perhaps a value shift at the gaming-focused company. It’s a useful reminder that even as crypto surges, becoming a darling of venture capitalists and a significant cultural and economic field, there’s still a significant amount of people that just don’t like what the industry stands for.  Slacktivists responded to Citron’s tweet calling for others to ditch the platform and cancel their paid subscriptions, one of the main revenue streams for a company that has resisted advertising. Many regurgitated claims of Ethereum’s intense energy use and noted how crypto scams have proliferated on the platform. Others just noted how annoying “NFT bros” can be.  Discord listened. Citron said Wednesday evening the platform has “no current plans” to integrate crypto wallets into its app. Indeed, this was never a formal announcement, and the tooling was likely part of a hackathon.  “We’re excited about the potential for Web 3 technology and the positive ways these communities are coming together on Discord, especially those organized around environmentally friendly, creator-focused projects,” the company told TechCrunch. “However, we also recognize there are some problems we need to work through. For now, we’re focused on protecting users from spams, scams and fraud.”  Web 3, the generic term for a blockchain-based alternative to the internet where users can own their data and hold stake in the tools they use, is a positive development. Outside of legal challenges to monopolistic internet giants, crypto presents the best way to counteract “surveillance capitalism.”  But for those that haven’t drunk the Kool-Aid, crypto appears to be hyper-capitalistic, capitalism-plus. It prefers markets over the state to find solutions and protect everyday people. It’s an avenue for the already rich to make almost insultingly large amounts of money. It advances the “neoliberal turn” towards financialization, globalization and commodification of everything.  Even though crypto promises a lot – in a phrase, “digital sovereignty” – it hasn’t achieved much over its decade-long existence. (Discounting the $3 trillion market cap.) That was a point repeatedly made last month, when Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) supporters took umbrage that the nonprofit focused on digital rights took a stand against overregulation of crypto.  The EFF shared over Twitter an op-ed written by heads of Fight For The Future and the Blockchain Association, two technology lobbying groups, that argued for crypto users to “confront” the “existential threat” of regulation. People were miffed – again, primarily, over environmental concerns and rampant scams. Some vowed to never again financially support the EFF.  Read more: More Firms Embracing the Metaverse and Gaming Stocks Have Already Benefited, Morgan Stanley Says  These are people who conceivably might support crypto from a digital rights and privacy perspective. But like the angry Discord mob, they seem to have already made up their minds about the industry. In both cases, these are likely savvy internet users and are not dismissing crypto out of hand.  There are legitimate reasons to be suspicious of crypto. Its current privacy issues (everything stays on a blockchain) and carbon footprint are solvable. It’ll be harder to reconcile crypto’s capitalistic aims – call it what you want, say Bitcoin is for all, but the money doesn’t lie – at a time when more people than ever are skeptical of the economic status quo.  Does crypto subvert the system or play into it? Is the discord it creates adding value?

42424318,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2n6Dh,1636654927,‘Curve Wars’ Heat Up: Emergency DAO Invoked After ‘Clear Governance Attack’,"The latest salvo in the multibillion-dollar “Curve Wars” might be the most daring yet, and the protocol’s response has revealed deep ideological fissures in the decentralized finance (DeFi) community.  Curve.Finance is the largest DeFi protocol with $20.8 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to CoinGecko. The protocol holds a vital place in the DeFi universe because of its CRV token rewards emissions – a key source of income for multiple other protocols and one of the foundational pillars of a rapidly growing $270 billion market.  On Wednesday night, a young project – memecoin-flavored Mochi Inu – executed a series of transactions that tilted CRV rewards in its favor by using a token-locking mechanism in Convex Finance, a yield farming protocol built on top of Curve.  This jockeying for CRV emission rewards is a common practice among protocols and is often referred to as the “Curve Wars.”  Read more: How Yield Farming on Curve Is Quietly Conquering DeFi  In a Twitter thread Thursday morning, Mochi formally announced themselves as a new player in the Curve Wars, writing that “Curve is the backbone of DeFi, and Convex is the kingmaker of Curve.”  Shortly after the transactions, however, the Curve Emergency DAO, a nine-person group using a multisignature scheme with limited governance powers over CRV reward emissions, cut off Mochi’s rewards, and in a governance forum post, semi-anonymous Curve contributor Charlie wrote that Mochi’s overnight actions were a “clear governance attack.”  In an interview with CoinDesk semi-anonymous Mochi founder AZ, also often referred to as Azeem, said that the Emergency DAO’s security concerns were “reasonable” and that he hopes to address those concerns in the coming weeks.  Nonetheless, the decision from the decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, has prompted much community debate, as some have argued that the protocol should not single out any one user and that blacklisting another protocol runs against DeFi’s open, permissionless ethos.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Charlie said that the decision to cut off Mochi’s CRV rewards wasn’t made lightly, but that the situation was unique.  “I hate this ‘I need protection’ meme we’ve seen from Gensler,” he said, referring to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler. “Curve definitely doesn’t want to be gatekeepers or protectors, but we gotta draw the line somewhere when it comes to bad behavior. Mochi crossed it seven times over last night.”  Exploitative or exploit?  Regardless of whether Mochi’s maneuvering was an attack or a clever abuse of various DeFi protocols’ utility, the events were a remarkable display of the interconnected nature of the DeFi ecosystem, spanning multiple projects and layered functions.  Curve is a decentralized exchange tool primarily designed for swapping assets that are similar to each other, such as different stablecoins or ETH and its staked derivatives such as stETH. Curve’s liquidity providers are rewarded with CRV, the protocol’s governance token.  At the core of Mochi’s “governance attack” is veCRV – voting escrow Curve, a locked version of CRV that grants holders the ability to vote on “boosting” CRV rewards to certain liquidity pools. Throughout 2021, various protocols have vied to accumulate CRV and lock it as veCRV in order to boost rewards to pools that will benefit them. As a result, locked Curve is a popular metric to track:  Mochi, a platform similar to asset-backed stablecoin issuers Spell and MakerDAO,gave users incentives to deposit assets in a Curve pool that included USDC, USDT, DAI and Mochi’s native stablecoin USDM leading into Wednesday night’s events, ultimately attracting over $170.2 million in liquidity at its peak, according to Azeem.  A final key cog in the events is Convex Finance. Convex is a protocol designed to maximize CRV rewards, and the protocol is now the largest veCRV holder with 136.58 million tokens, which is more than a third of CRV’s circulating supply. Users who lock Convex’s CVX token have the right to vote proportionally on how the protocol’s tokens are used for boosting the rate of rewards.  On Wednesday night, all of the above protocols and mechanics were on display. A Mochi team member swapped $46 million in USDM for DAI using the Mochi Curve pool, swapped the DAI for ETH and used a large portion of that ETH to purchase massive quantities of CVX, which they then locked.  This would have allowed them to vote on additional CRV rewards for the Mochi pool, which in turn would have attracted additional liquidity, allowing them to swap even more USDM for stablecoins to buy more CVX – ultimately creating a flywheel heavily tilting CRV rewards in their favor and attracting huge sums of liquidity to their platform.  Multiple observers have noted that KeeperDAO, FRAX, Olympus, CREAM and other DAO communities are voting or have voted to pursue similar strategies (if at a smaller scale), but the demands of public governance have slowed them down, and they couldn’t unilaterally move to seize voting power the way Mochi did.  Warning signs  As Mochi’s transactions unfolded, DeFi community members were quick to point out that the young protocol had numerous security and operational flaws, including that the team could arbitrarily print more USDM and that the price oracle for the token – a key piece of infrastructure that is often the target of hackers – was manually set by a team member’s address.  Additionally, Azeem is a controversial figure in the DeFi sector. While running the Armor.fi insurance protocol, the developer was accused of personally deciding not to pay a user with a legitimate claim in February. Later that month, following a social engineering attack on an Armor team member that resulted in a $1 million loss, Azeem defended his colleague by saying that the developer was “sleepy and tired,” a phrase that has become widely mocked.  Multiple high-profile DeFi developers criticized Tuesday night’s scheme, with Yearn.Finance founder Andre Cronje referring to the transactions as “amazingly scammy.”  In an interview with CoinDesk, Banteg, a pseudonymous Yearn core contributor and one of the nine members of the Curve Emergency DAO, said the flywheel was dangerous given USDM’s dubious backing.  “Internal thinking was around mitigating the feedback loop Andre described when he first drew attention to the issue. With high concentration of votes towards one pool, it could cut into other pools, ultimately hurting Curve [liquidity providers],” Banteg said. “We know for a fact USDM is a worthless collateral. In retrospect, Curve DAO should’ve done a better due diligence on it.”  The Emergency DAO ultimately elected to cut off the Mochi pool’s rewards. At the time of writing, the pool has more than 31 million USDM valued at $0.49 per token and $1.3 million in stablecoins. Banteg noted he wasn’t among the signers on the transaction that ended emissions to Mochi’s pool.  Charlie said that the lack of basic security practices and not Azeem’s reputation led the DAO to take the unprecedented action. This is the first time the Emergency DAO has been invoked.  “I don’t think this Mochi situation is comparable to any other protocol building around Curve. There is a clear pattern of misbehavior and lack of concern for security, best practices and users’ funds,” Charlie said.  “I’m aware [Azeem] hasn’t got the best reputation, but I also don’t know about what happened with those other projects, and I prefer to work with the information I do have.”  Azeem told CoinDesk that Mochi will address the security concerns expressed by the Emergency DAO and that the team plans to add “more secure multisig structure with additional signer requirements per transaction, suitable LTV (loan to value) parameters and clear tokenomics.”  “Once these are resolved we believe the gauge reinstatement will be deemed suitable, independent of strategic fears the whales and influencers may have with respect to our bold approach to gaining voting power in the DAO,” he said.  Rules of engagement  Mochi’s aggressive strategy and Curve’s ensuing governance action have prompted significant debate in the DeFi community.  Azeem blamed an unnamed “DeFi cartel” for how Mochi Inu has been treated, saying that Mochi poses a threat to the Curve Wars status quo.  “They are shocked and feel threatened that a small player on the outskirts of the Curve/Convex ecosystem became a powerhouse and a threat to their fledgling monopolies overnight. Is this not DeFi?” he asked.  Likewise, a number of observers have criticized both the existence of the Emergency DAO and that they chose to act, saying that signaling out a single user is inappropriate in what should be a permissionless system.  Regardless of the controversy, Curve’s Charlie expressed some relief that there are now clear rules of engagement in the Curve Wars.  “I’m somewhat glad we drew the line of what a protocol can and can’t do. We’ve seen an escalation of bribes with different protocols trying to grab more and more power with Convex and Curve.”",NEUTRAL,CRV | ETH | DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | CRV | ETH | MINING | DAI,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/11/curve-wars-heat-up-emergency-dao-invoked-after-clear-governance-attack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fe8f834e4b3dbafd7f16f239e691e1b1f4e5e207-5184x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411144,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gj7kRl,1636652795,This Imprisoned Russian Artist Is Selling NFTs to Support His Family and Fellow Inmates,"Every morning, Pavel Skazkin wakes up at the command of correctional officers while the Russian national anthem plays in the background. Four times a day, guards check on him.  The correctional facility where he lives is not as strict as the penal colony he was sent to at the age of 27, after he got caught with a package of marijuana and ecstasy. Inmates at his current residence can walk out of the guarded territory to attend their workplaces in a nearby town, as well as use internet-connected devices.  In the latter option he has found a creative outlet, a sense of purpose – and, thanks to the flourishing NFT market, extra income to supplement his inmate’s salary of $140 a month.  Skazkin, now 31, creates surreal digital art on an iPad and sells non-fungible tokens (NFT) of the works under the handle Papasweeds – a wordplay on his criminal charges, family story and self-reflection after four years of incarceration. His art NFTs, too, are a form of reflection on his life and the nature of the Russian penal system.  To help others suffering similar hardships, Skazkin has pledged to donate one-third of the proceeds from his NFT sales to Russia Behind Bars, a non-profit dedicated to aiding inmates and their families.  “I know how hard it is, both to be in prison and to wait for your family member to get out,” the artist told CoinDesk in a phone interview. “I’d like to help.”  Skazkin’s story is an unusually dramatic example of how the current wave of hype and speculation around NFTs sometimes provides new ways to support causes such as human rights, domestic violence victims and independent journalism.  Locked art  Skazkin started drawing his future NFT sketches while in the penal colony in Russia’s Bryansk region – 200 miles from his home in the Moscow area – where he was initially placed in 2017 after being sentenced to six years behind bars. All electronic communications and gadgets are forbidden in such facilities.  Three years into his term, Skazkin managed to successfully appeal for a lighter punishment and was transferred to the venue where he is serving his time now, also in Bryansk. And he immediately started turning his drawings into digital art, he said.  He sold his first prison-inspired NFTs for modest prices on Hic et Nunc, a lesser-known NFT marketplace that runs on the Tezos blockchain, which has lower transaction fees than the dominant NFT platform, Ethereum.  This is how Skazkin got into the Russian-speaking NFT community and joined the Telegram group of NFT Bastards, a loose group of artists that this year sold NFTs to help Russian online media outlet Meduza.  Read more:Russian Artists to Sell NFTs to Support Journalists Under Pressure  Then, NFT trader Ilya Orlov noticed the non-typical artist in the chat and thought he’d like to help.  “First thing we need to change [in Russia] is prisons,” Orlov told CoinDesk in a joint interview with Skazkin.  “As long as we’re torturing our own people this way, nothing can change for the better. We need to get people’s attention on that, especially now when the information [about torture in Russian colonies] got public,” Orlov added, pointing at the recent publication of blood-chilling video footage of inmates being tortured in one of Russia’s penal colonies.  Orlov is helping Skazkin to fund his NFT minting; with his inmate’s salary of about $140 a month, the artist can hardly afford network transaction fees (the so-called gas fees) for creating these tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, a smart contract has been programmed to automatically split the proceeds from each NFT sale three ways: 33% will go to Papasweeds himself, helping him support his wife and three children, 33% to Orlov for his assistance and 33% to Russia Behind Bars.  Orlov said he believes Papasweeds’ prospects are huge. “In the West, people value and respect Russian pain and suffering, hence the popularity of Dostoyevsky,” he said. “I told [Skazkin], you get free, we apply for a U.S. visa and make you an exhibition in New York.”  Upon his release two years from now, Skazkin is planning to mint 72, or 66+6, NFTs, as written on his page on Foundation, a prestigious invite-only platform for NFT artists. Although 666 is the Biblical number of the beast, to Skazkin 66+6 is just a nice number, the artist told CoinDesk. He initially planned to do 666 NFTs until his prison term is over, but then realized he doesn’t have enough time until his scheduled release in 2023. So 666 turned into 66+6.  The weeds  Back in 2017, Skazkin, a not-too-successful web designer by trade, worked at an illegal online shop hosted on RAMP, a formerly popular darknet marketplace shut down by the Russian authorities the same year. One day, he was hired to pick up a package of drugs and pass it to sellers who would then divide the batch into smaller parts and deliver those to online buyers.  Skazkin was caught with that weed by the police and sent to jail for six years for drug trafficking. The prosecutor asked for a 10-year sentence, but Skazkin, a father of three, got six years.  After serving part of his term, Skazkin managed to litigate and win a lighter punishment, even though he had no attorney to help him draft court papers, he said. (His account was confirmed by Russia Behind Bars’ Olga Romanova.)  “I studied in the prison library, read the laws,” he said.  When asked about his nickname, Skazkin said it’s a portmanteau of several things. The nickname “papa” stuck to him after he became a father of three. “Weeds” is a double entendre: It refers to Skazkin’s drug-related crime; also, kosyak, the Russian slang for a bad mistake or a screwup is the same word as the one for a joint.  Skazkin is candid about his criminal charges and prison experience. He definitely ended up in prison for the right reason, he said. However, he believes his sentence was overly harsh. His first NFT work on Foundation, “Hall of Shame,” depicts a judge and a crying child in a courtroom – a metaphor of how he recalls his own trial.  “I felt like a kid being punished for the sweets he’d stolen, and there was nothing I could do. Whatever I had to say would sound like baby talk,” he recalls.  Spending several years in a Russian prison was a tough experience, but it changed him for the better, Skazkin said: “I got my brain in the right place. Got rid of many complexes, useless thoughts, became more aware.”  The lesson came at a steep price, though.  The penal colony near the city of Bryansk, where he served three years, is known as one of Russia’s cruelest correctional facilities, infamous for beatings and torture of inmates (links to articles in Russian).  “It was, you know, quite a school of humiliation,” Skazkin said.  Darknet education  It was working on the darknet that helped Skazkin to familiarize himself with the concept of crypto early on – back in 2017, he already had some bitcoin, he said.  In prison, he could only get news about crypto from print newspapers and magazines, or from the rare mentions on the Russian state TV the inmates were allowed to watch, or from his family members who would come to visit.  “In 2017, I saw bitcoin growing and was biting my elbows [because] I was in that place,” he said. In February of this year, Skazkin was reading Popular Mechanics magazine and saw a story about the famous meme-based NFT Nyan Cat, which sold for a whopping 300 ETH, worth about $590,000 at recent levels.  “I was like, what are these NFTs? OK, I know what crypto is, I had a bitcoin wallet, but this is also about drawing,” Skazkin said. He decided he would create his own NFT as soon as he got to the internet.  Olga Romanova, head of the non-profit Russia Behind Bars, said the organization has been raising money with crypto donations for five years now, and no less than 30% of all donations now come in crypto. Russia Behind Bars is accepting bitcoin, ether, litecoin and XRP, its website says.  NFTs, however, are something new for the advocacy group.  “Can’t say I understand digital art. But I understand people who got in trouble but weren’t broken, keep growing and trying to support their families, as well as other prisoners,” Romanova said: “This doesn’t happen very often and this alone deserves attention and support.”  Read more:Russian Activists Use Bitcoin, and the Kremlin Doesn’t Like It",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | XTZ,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/11/this-imprisoned-russian-artist-is-selling-nfts-to-support-his-family-and-fellow-inmates,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/10bc1ab3556b5b61c75d860772e412bffd9b45af-1197x799.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The yield comes from the staking of the city’s own cryptocurrency, MiamiCoin, which was introduced early this year and has already earned over $21 million in the past three months for Miami. Suarez noted that if you were to annualize that revenue, it would equal roughly one-fifth of Miami’s total annual tax revenue of $400 million.  The city will make the payments through a digital wallet and will work with a variety of cryptocurrency exchanges to allow its residents to acquire a wallet, register and get verified, the mayor said.  “[Mayor Suarez] just turned his city into an oil-producing country that gives bitcoin yield to its citizens. That’s incredible,” Community Lead for CityCoins Patrick Stanley told CoinDesk TV. CityCoins is the organization that set up and runs MiamiCoin.  In the long run, Suarez said the approach could potentially eliminate the need for Miami residents to pay taxes, which would be “revolutionary.”  “I do see very quickly a world where the satoshi system is what is used to make payments,” Mayor Suarez said. “We need for people to understand that … yes, we want you to hold bitcoin but we also want to increase the utility of bitcoin.”  Read more: CityCoin’s Plan for NYCCoin Is Welcomed by Mayor-Elect Adams",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/11/miami-to-give-bitcoin-yield-from-miamicoin-to-its-citizens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/db3ef8991dc3cc268f3effd5c26535835b1b64f0-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The fundraise follows a $4.3 million raise in January.  Founded in 2020, San Francisco-based Saddle is a decentralized AMM on the Ethereum blockchain that’s optimized for tokens that have their value pegged to an underlying asset in some way. The value of a tokenized bitcoin, for example, is supposed to equal 1 BTC.  Saddle says it enables cheap, efficient and low-slippage swaps for traders and high-yield pools for liquidity providers (LPs). Slippage in this context refers to the difference between a trade’s expected price and the price at which the trade is executed. Slippage tends to happen when markets are volatile.  “This investment will enable Saddle to continue advancing its offerings that allow pegged value crypto assets to achieve efficiency, profitability and growth. With this funding, we plan to expand our team, help bring low-slippage stablecoins to every chain in [Decentralized finance], position Saddle to better serve a multi-chain future, and invest in the Saddle community and creator metaverse,” said Saddle founder Sunil Srivatsa in a press release.  Customers only need an ERC-20 compatible wallet like MetaMask to use Saddle. The company’s protocol is audited and secured by blockchain security firms like Certik, Quantstamp and OpenZeppelin.  “Saddle’s team is mission-driven and the vision is big – from decreasing slippage between asset swaps to providing liquidity into Saddle pools,” said Polychain General Partner Niraj Pant in the release.

42424312,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2n65h,1636639200,Smart Contract Platform Agoric Launches Public Chain,"Agoric, a JavaScript-native smart contract platform, announced the launch of its public chain, which comes a month after the company completed a $32 million private token sale.  Agoric says its proof-of-stake chain with JavaScript smart contracts offers developers a secure and reliable cross-chain ecosystem for building and deploying decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. The development environment provides reusable governance, lending and trading components.  The first phase of Agoric’s launch introduces the BLD (build) staking token and the Agoric chain built using the Cosmos software development kit (SDK). BLD supports staking, governance and decentralization. The token is backed by Kepir, a browser extension wallet for the inter-blockchain ecosystem, which will also provide governance and staking services for the Agoric blockchain.  “Today, the DeFi development environment is failing to reach its full potential. By bringing DeFi to the overlooked JavaScript community, Agoric is blasting open the DeFi economy to over 10 million innovative and curious developers, enterprises and institutions to create the dapps of tomorrow,” said Agoric co-founder and CEO Dean Tribble in the press release.  Tribble previously worked as a principal architect at Microsoft. Agoric Chief Scientist Mark Miller was a Google research scientist and wrote Agoric Open Systems Papers back in 1988. The papers provided an early outline of software creating and participating in markets.  Token sale  The private token sale saw participation from early investors including MetaStable, Polychain, Rockaway and Gumi Ventures. Additional backers included Placeholder, DAO Maker and Figment, among others. The sale will help fuel Agoric’s next stage of growth, including scaling the ecosystem and developer programs, the company said.  “Smart contracts on open data layers create the foundation for a system reboot of finance, technology and digital life. Led by a team of esteemed pioneers in smart contract technology, Agoric is building a protocol that will bring the JavaScript developer community – the world’s largest developer community – into the fold of the metaverse movement,” said Placeholder co-founder and Partner Chris Burniske in the release.  Phased rollout  Agoric’s public mainnet went live on Nov. 1, kicking off the multipart mainnet rollout. Phase 0 involves governance setup and building out the community of BLD token holders.

42421696,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXp9X3,1636638600,Demystifying Blockchain for Your Clients,"The cryptocurrency world is full of jargon. You’ve got your non-fungible tokens (NFT), your Ethereum, your Solana, your know-your-customer (KYC), your altcoins, your stablecoins – not to mention where it all started: bitcoin.  If all this jargon had a home, it would be the metaverse, or the parallel digital world in which cryptocurrency and NFTs are transactable. And the metaverse would not be possible without blockchain, the system of decentralized databases upon which all interactions are coded and stored into perpetuity.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  In the proverbial chicken-or-egg debate, cryptocurrency and blockchain happened simultaneously, says Robert Konsdorf, the CEO of Facings, a Michigan-based company that creates user-friendly blockchain publishing tools. Bitcoin was both the first publicly debuted blockchain and the first cryptocurrency. Some 12 years ago, its inventor, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, authored a famous document known simply as the Bitcoin white paper describing the concept for the world.  Today, there are reportedly hundreds of blockchains floating around the metaverse, all with varying degrees of functionality and relevance. “You can take the code for any blockchain and make a new one out of it,” Konsdorf tells CoinDesk. “So there’s a lot of goofy or dead ones that don’t have real investment or operations.”  But however goofy blockchain may appear – or be – the technology is here to stay. So if you or your clients have questions, we’ve got a few answers to help you out.  Explaining the appeal of blockchain  Simply put, a blockchain is a particular kind of digital database that’s distributed among computers or groups of computers called nodes. Nodes are hubs through which all the electronic information inside a respective network gets generated, sent and received. Blockchain is the ledger that collects and stores this data in groups, or “blocks.” Hence its name.  Blockchain technology is still in its early days. “I always tell people blockchains are really slow, really expensive and really public databases,” says Konsdorf.  But the databases are immutable, says Ashok Ranadive, director of professional services at the enterprise blockchain company, CasperLabs—which is a game changer.  “The history is recorded in a clean manner,” Ranadive tells CoinDesk, unlike the countless number of messy records used to maintain most of our institutions currently. This suggests the potential for unprecedented financial transparency. Once you make a transaction on blockchain it can’t ever be deleted, only modified. The ledger is composed of an ongoing series of additive records that erase nothing and preserve everything.  Last, blockchains are decentralized. They aren’t regulated by a government, a bureau, a corporation, a bank or any third-party body of any kind. Through what are known as “smart contracts,” each transaction on blockchain contains instructions in the form of code.  “The way the money is controlled is actually just what is written in the software,” explains Phillip Gara, director of strategy for the Render Network, a company that uses blockchain to process high-quality graphics. Arguably, you might say a form of auto-regulation occurs within the code’s instructions, and that this theoretically eliminates the need for enforced compliance to any kind of governing body.  The limitless potential of blockchain  Once blockchain becomes universally adopted, the average person probably won’t need to know how exactly it works so much as how to actually use it. Consider the internet. How many of us know what IP addresses are, what routers are doing behind the scenes and how a transport control protocol works? We just need to know how to log on, input our password and go to the websites we want to visit.  According to Konsdorf, blockchain will likely become a place where “humanity can put public records that mean the most to society.” For instance, smart contracts could be written to document monetary exchanges, voting records, deeds and proofs of authenticity.  “These are all constructs that can benefit from having a high degree of public data integrity,” Konsdorf says.  The potential of blockchain as an infrastructure is seemingly limitless, with recent happenings on Wall Street indicating a growing confidence from investors in crypto and the technology.  Getting started  To get your clients started with blockchain, talk them through opening their first crypto wallet. The most beginner-friendly way to start learning about crypto and blockchain is with a centralized exchange like Coinbase, which monitors transactions and uses standard KYC protocol to validate users’ identities.  As with most sensitive information, encourage your clients to use good data hygiene, such as storing their public and private wallet keys in a secure location (not somewhere that can be easily hacked like Evernote or Google Docs).  And if your clients aren’t interested in cryptocurrency, there will be opportunities to invest in more passive blockchain-related securities in the future. The companies creating this software are ramping up fast, and eventually blockchain tech and VC firms will go public and trade on all major exchanges. While the enthusiasm surrounding crypto and NFTs can easily create FOMO [fear of missing out], it’s good to remind clients that we’re just at the beginning, and staying abreast of the latest blockchain news is a good stepping stone for someone who’s still unsure of how they want to get in on the action.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Megan DeMatteo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/11/11/demystifying-blockchain-for-your-clients,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5740a442b3eefc6861e4ef5735fa4789a7a5415a-3580x2840.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42421683,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXp9Mj,1636638600,"As Crypto Bulls And Bears Abound, Who Should You Believe?","Every time the zeal for digital assets from crypto enthusiasts crescendos, so does the derision from crypto critics.  Recently, as bitcoin futures exchange-traded funds made their debuts in the U.S. and the price of the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value leaped above $65,000, a world-renowned economist and a star bond fund manager took to social media and the airwaves to voice their concerns about digital assets.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  In the first case, economist Nassim Nicholas Taleb likened the rise of bitcoin to the 17th-century Dutch tulip bubble. For those unfamiliar with that, in the 1600s, the Dutch went wild for unusual and rare variants of the tulip, paying exorbitant prices for some varieties before the bubble popped and the market collapsed. Taleb is implying the same thing may happen to the cryptocurrency.  In the second, Scott Minerd, chief investment officer at Guggenheim Global, declared most cryptocurrencies as “garbage” and said that most digital tokens will fade away or end disastrously, like the dot-com sector did when the bubble of the 1990s finally burst at the end of the decade.  To me, both of those criticisms seem to amount to the same argument, with two different outcomes: Cryptocurrencies are in a bubble. Taleb believes that a crash is imminent and that tokens won’t be able to recover their value, while Minerd believes that most tokens will end up in the dustbin of history, but that some coins – bitcoin in particular – will survive.  Time will tell whether either pundit is right, but it’s hard for me to imagine a multitrillion dollar asset class and the influential technology behind it just disappearing if and when a valuation bubble pops.  Enthusiasts and skeptics take sides  Since the advent of bitcoin, crypto skeptics and enthusiasts have lined up to voice their opinions about the long-term prospects for the digital assets market.  The enthusiast side includes people like billionaire Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz and the Winklevoss twins, founders of the Gemini Exchange, but those people obviously have skin in the game. More interesting is the enthusiasm that comes from people such as noted financial advisor Ric Edelman and Tesla founder Elon Musk, as they aren’t crypto “natives” and they bring energy and attention to digital assets from other industries.  Meanwhile, skeptics include Berkshire Hathaway’s legendary tandem of Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger, economist Paul Krugman, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, as well as financial advisor icons Peter Mallouk and Michael Kitces. And another skeptic, speaking of financial icons, is Carl Icahn.  Even more interesting is the recent string of crypto converts – people who started out as skeptics but have changed their minds on digital assets. These include economic historian Niall Ferguson, journalist Kevin Roose and a host of Wall Street legends such as Ray Dalio, Stanley Druckenmiller and Paul Tudor Jones.  What the skeptics, including Taleb and Minerd, believe is that one, the public zeal for digital assets will at some point drop, and two, that the volatility of assets like bitcoin will help accelerate their undoing.  That may be a myopic viewpoint, because it focuses on the utility of digital assets as investments alone. It’s like looking at a stock market as merely a mechanism for registering public opinion on the names and tickers of the companies themselves, completely agnostic to the underlying earnings, cash flow and growth.  Beyond digital assets as investments alone  Steve Larsen – founder of both PlannerDao, a source of digital assets information and infrastructure for financial advisors, and the Certified Digital Assets Advisor (CDAA) designation – argues that many advisors are missing the point when it comes to viewing and understanding digital assets. Larsen is a former Edward Jones advisor and an accountant who founded the CDAA as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Unlike the CFP Board (Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards) and the Investments and Wealth Institute, which are both central governing bodies that manage certifications, the CDAA is governed by advisors who vote on requirements and policies as a community.  “Digital assets will revolutionize not just investing, but the economy, as well,” said Larsen. “Step one is understanding cryptocurrencies and other digital asset as an asset class and how they fit into a portfolio. Step two, which is coming much faster than most people realize, is that cryptocurrency is also a delivery system that will on some level forever change how we access financial products and services.”  The first place that has come to light is the advent of decentralized savings and payments platforms, and it will spread to investment accounts and the financial and technological infrastructure that advisors rely on to work on behalf of their clients, Larsen said.  Changing technology and public discourse  The first wave of change from blockchain technology has targeted banks, and one of the next waves will target traditional broker-dealers and custodians. Because digital assets are designed to be assets investors can hold themselves, Larsen argues that the underlying technology could one day render broker-dealers and custodians obsolete, replaced by algorithms operating at little or no cost to the advisor or end investor.  “Advice is a product that never goes out of style; it’s a service that’s always needed, but the product distribution system we are traditionally forced to deal with is going away,” he said. “Digital assets will cut out many of the layers of middlemen that it has traditionally taken to invest client money, and that’s who is really going to miss out, not the planner on the front end.”  Until that shift happens, though, the public discourse on cryptocurrencies will continue to be over their utility as an investible asset class, Larsen said, which means we will have to live with the push and pull between skeptics and enthusiasts, bulls and bears.  “There’s a reason we’re all trying to get over and through any intermediate time frame, because that’s what it is going to take before people can clearly see the utility digital assets will bring to their day-to-day lives,” Larsen said.  “It is like the internet. Conceptually, it all made sense, but it didn’t really come together until people saw the difference in their lives. That’s holding digital assets back from the true explosion a lot of us are waiting for, and part of that explosion can’t happen until independent advisors feel like they can bring their clients to crypto in a safe and legal way.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/11/as-crypto-bulls-and-bears-abound-who-should-you-believe,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/18f5fa31b1915ec3d3602c5822446eb5ea019187-2294x1306.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In the announcement, the SEC’s Enforcement Division alleged that on Sept. 16, American CryptoFed “filed a materially deficient and misleading registration form known as a Form 10, which purported to register two digital tokens issued by the company – the ‘ducat’ and ‘locke’ tokens – as equity securities.”  The SEC alleged that this form lacked mandated information about the tokens and American CryptoFed’s business, including audited financial statements. It also alleged that the Form 10 misstated and omitted information, including whether the ducat and locke tokens are securities.  American CryptoFed CEO Marian Orr wrote in an email to CoinDesk that the company had sent a letter to the SEC on Oct. 12 that “rebutted point by point the deficiencies raised” by agency. Orr added: “If the SEC is unready to make a declaration that CryptoFed’s two tokens are not securities, to meet the spirit of Securities Laws’ transparency and disclosure, we shall argue SEC should allow our Form 10 filing to become effective in time so that we may continue disclosing material and substantial information to the SEC, related parties and the general public.”  In September, American CryptoFed filed an S-1 form to register the tokens with the SEC for use in a secondary market and in refundable auctions at a higher value than their original purchase price from CryptoFed. In the filing, the company described the ducat and locke “as utility tokens, not as securities.”  In July, Wyoming legally recognized American CryptoFed. That determination came after the state became the first in the U.S. to recognize DAOs as a type of limited liability company.  In its announcement Wednesday, the SEC also said that in an S-8 form, an SEC registration form that allows companies to offer employees securities through employment benefit plans, American CryptoFed had failed to disclose that completing the form wouldn’t legally allow the distribution of the tokens.  “Issuers attempting to raise money from the public must provide the information necessary for investors to make informed decisions,” said Kristina Littman, chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s cyber unit. “We allege American CryptoFed made materially misleading statements and failed to provide legally required information in its registration form.”  An administrative law judge will decide whether to deny or suspend the tokens’ registration, the SEC said.
