42430457,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMtE1h,1556888434,Bitcoin-Gold Price Correlation Shows Widest Spread in Over a Year,"With gold on the defensive and down roughly 6 percent since mid-February, bitcoin may continue to shine brightly in the near future. After all, experts have found the two assets to be inversely correlated.  The 90-day correlation coefficient between bitcoin and gold – a statistical measure of linear interdependence between the two variables – is currently seen at -0.71, the lowest level since March 20.  A negative number represents an inverse relationship, i.e. meaning the two variables are moving in opposite directions, which has been the case between bitcoin and gold since November.  For instance, the yellow metal found takers at $1,200 on November 13 and was flirting with the psychological resistance of $1,300 at the end of December. During the same period, bitcoin, fell from $6,200 to $3,122, according to Bitstamp data.  It is worth noting that correlation does not imply causation. When a strong correlation develops between the two variables, it does not necessarily mean that one is causing or influencing the other.  The gold rally witnessed in November-December could be associated with the broad-based US dollar weakness triggered by speculation that the Federal Reserve will pause interest rate hikes in 2019. Bitcoin, however, did not benefit from the same dollar sell-off and tanked to 15-month lows near $3,100.  The negative correlation had weakened somewhat in the first quarter with bitcoin recovering to $4,000 by February end amid an extended gold price rally to a February 20 high of $1,346.  By February’s end, however, the gold market completed pricing in the Fed rate hike pause, which the central bank confirmed in March, opening doors for the “sell the news” move in the yellow metal.  Gold ended March below $1,300 and has remained on the back foot ever since. As of this writing, it is trading at $1,270 per ounce, representing a 5.6 percent drop from February highs.  Interestingly, bitcoin surged past key resistance at $4,236 on April 2 - two days after gold found acceptance below $1,300 - and jumped to a five-month of high $5,622, according to CoinDesk price data. This revived the strong inverse correlation with the precious metal.  With gold looking increasingly weak, there is reason to believe that the cryptocurrency market leader may extend its ongoing rally past the psychological resistance of $6,000.  GOLD and BTC Technicals  From a technical perspective, gold is indeed developing a bearish market structure referred to as the “head and shoulders” reversal pattern, which suggests more downside is likely in the near future.  The pattern generally appears as three consecutive troughs, the middle of which being the tallest, essentially depicts the failure of a trend to maintain its bullish streak of successive higher price highs.  Gold broke down from the pattern on April 16, confirmed by its price finding acceptance below the pattern’s neckline, with its scope now set for the 200-day moving average currently located at $1252. Support will need to be provided in order to avoid further depreciation.  That said, we can create a measured breakdown of this pattern by subtracting the size of the head from the breakdown point, which suggests more downside is possible toward $1220.  Again, correlation is not causation, but gold’s near-term bearish outlook may be a sign of positive things to come for bitcoin’s direction.

Callers generally claim to be officials from the Social Security Administration or other law enforcement agencies and threaten victims, requesting bitcoin, prepaid gift cards, and bank wire transfers, NYPD said earlier this week.  The department said that scammers have already stolen over $2 million so far this year by defrauding more than 200 people. Last year, the NYPD received only three similar complaints with direct mention of bitcoin.  Victims are usually told by impersonators that their Social Security number is involved in illegal activity like drug trafficking or money laundering and that to protect their money or to avoid being arrested victims must send money in bitcoin to a certain address.  Scammers use a technology called ""spoofing"" to manipulate caller IDs to display phone numbers of the Social Security Administration and other official agencies. Sometimes, they also use the names of real officers, the NYPD said.  NYPD chief of community affairs, Nilda Hofmann, said:  ""Sophisticated phone scams use the trust victims have in their own governmental and law enforcement agencies against them. Victims of this type of phone scam are not limited to senior citizens—these criminals are targeting every strata of society and every demographic is vulnerable.”  The department noted that it will never call individuals to ask for money or information over the phone.  Last month, the Berkeley Police Department also issued a similar warning, saying that scammers masked their own telephone numbers with official numbers on users’ caller id and demand payments.

42430462,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMtE9h,1556875815,"Bitcoin Price Spikes to Fresh 5-Month Highs Above $5,700","View  Bitcoin has printed a 5.5-month high of $5,714 today, reinforcing the bullish view put forward by the cryptocurrency's recent bounce from the 30-day moving average and April's bullish close above the 21-month exponential moving average.  BTC appears on track to test the psychological resistance of $6,000 soon.  A UTC close below the 30-day MA at $5,221 would abort the short-term bullish setup.  A failure to secure a weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above the 50-week moving average, currently at $5,418, could invite profit taking, yielding a fall back to $5,000.  Bitcoin's (BTC) price hit 5.5-month highs above $5,700 soon before press time, bolstering both short- and long-term bullish views.  The cryptocurrency market leader rose to $5,714 at 08:340 UTC, the highest level since Nov. 18, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. BTC was last seen trading at $5,682, representing a 5.6 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  The rally to 5.5-month highs has strengthened the bullish case put forward by the cryptocurrency's recent bounce from the crucial 30-day moving average (MA) after a drop when the recent Bitfinex controversy hit the news.  Further, it validates April's bullish close above the former support-turned-resistance of the 21-month exponential moving average of the price.  Last but not the least, with the recent bounce from levels below $5,000, the cryptocurrency has invalidated a strong bearish indicator pattern, as seen in the chart below. As a result, prices could rise to $6,000 over the next few days.  Daily chart  As seen above (prices via Bitstamp), the 30-day MA has lived up to its reputation of being strong support by reversing the price pullback from highs above $5,600 to $5,000.  More importantly, with the bounce, the relative strength index (RSI) seems to have found acceptance above the descending trendline, representing a bearish divergence confirmed on April 24.  In the past, BTC has suffered significant price pullbacks following the confirmation of the bearish divergence of the RSI. This time, however, the pattern failed – a sign of strong bullish sentiment.  What's more, the Chaikin money flow index, used to measure the money flow volume over a set period of time (usually 21 days), has risen from 0.0036 to 0.12 in the last few days, confirming the uptrend in price.  So, BTC could close well above the April 23 high of $5,627 today, further strengthening the case for a rally to $6,000.  On the way higher, BTC may encounter resistance at $5,780 (June 2018 bottom) and $5,880 (August 2018 bottom), as discussed yesterday.  Weekly chart  Bitcoin has breached the 50-week MA resistance, currently at $5,418, on the weekly chart. However, confirmation of the breakout is needed in the form of a close above $5,418 on Sunday (UTC).  The case for a pullback to levels below $5,000 would strengthen if the buyers fail to keep prices above the key average for the second week.

42430456,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMtDxh,1556874001,Bitcoin Mining’s New Bidding War,"The Takeaway  As bitcoin's price edges up, secondhand mining equipment is becoming more profitable to run  As a result, the price of used miners has nearly doubled in recent weeks, to $250-$320 for old Bitmain Antminers  Somewhere between 220,000 and 700,000 mining units could come online this summer  Newer, more powerful models won't be shipped for months and take longer to pay for themselves      The cost of secondhand cryptocurrency mining equipment in China has nearly doubled in recent weeks as a result of bitcoin’s price jump over the same period.  The bull run that began in mid-April has made these machines more profitable to run – and hence more valuable. According to blockchain data firm TokenInsight, as recently as April 8, an investment in most types of crypto mining equipment would take 200 to 350 days to pay for itself.  But bitcoin’s climb from the low $4,000 range in early April to well above $5,000 has resulted in a drop in the payback period (a miner's price divided by its daily profit) for several secondhand models to less than 200 days.  “When the payback period is apparently below 200 days, it has made more miners feel there’s an opportunity,” said Michael Zhong, a mining analyst at TokenInsight. “That further incentivizes their buying demand for secondhand models and leads to a price jump and will bring the payback period back above 200 days again.”  This market change is having an impact on businesspeople like Darius Sharif Samani, an independent miner who owns machines in China and brokers equipment sales. When he started asking around in March, Samani managed to buy secondhand AntMiner S9 units for $140, he told CoinDesk. Made by mining giant Bitmain, these machines can run computations at a speed of 14 terahashes per second, or TH/S.  Since then, the price for the same machine has jumped to at least above $250, and it would cost more than $280 to buy an advanced version of the AntMiner S9 that generates 14.5 TH/s, while some have even asked for $320 per unit, Samani said. That works out to $22 per terahash.  If prices keep rising, equipment purchases could become prohibitive for most. Samani told CoinDesk:  “Nobody besides a couple of the well-financed farms is willing to spend $23 per terahash on new hardware.”  Out of stock, or stockpiling?  Some mining equipment wholesalers have even told Samani that some models were sold out.  “First time in months somebody told me they’ve run out of certain models, which hasn’t been the case in like, forever,” he said.  But he also remains suspicious about whether wholesalers were telling the truth when they made claims about running out of stock.  “Some are waiting until a bidding war for some models to start,” Samani said. “There may be lots of individual miners, but they are getting squeezed out.”  TokenInsight’s Zhong echoed that sentiment, adding it’s usually the mining equipment wholesalers and secondhand equipment market-makers that are stockpiling gear.  Market expansion  Apart from the recent bitcoin price jump, the overall anticipation of cheap hydro-power during the water-abundant summer in China could also be contributing to the increasing demand for equipment.    Mining farm operators in China’s southwestern region previously estimated there will be over 1 million machines running in the area during the summer, and that this could push the hash power of the bitcoin network as a high as 70 quintillion hashes per second (EH/s).      That would be a new all-time high – the previous record of 60 EH/s was set in August of last year, according to Blockchain.info data.      If all of the extra 10EH/s comes from new models like the AntMiner S17, which generates around 45TH/s, that would mean 220,000 additional units devoted to the market in the coming months, assuming bitcoin's price holds steady. (10 EH equals 10 million TH.)      But if it all comes from older secondhand models like the AntMiner S9, each with a hash power of 14TH/s, the number of units coming online would be much higher, at 700,000.      Currently, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is now seeing around 50 EH/s in terms of total hash power.    Supply and demand  Chris Zhu, co-founder of Poolin, a China-based crypto mining pool, said another driver of the increasing demand for secondhand equipment is new capital from newcomers.  “There’s a large amount new capital weighing in this year, who didn’t experience mining cryptocurrencies in a water season in a bearish market,” he added. “And they are much less risk-averse.”  One new entrant is a $44.5 million mining fund raised by the Shanghai-based blockchain investment firm Fundamental Labs, which is betting on both equipment and mining farm operations ahead of the summer season.  Both Zhu and Raymond Yuan, founder of Fundamental Labs, acknowledged that this year there will be more mining farms than usable mining equipment circulating in the market.  “There are many what’s called ‘futures farms,’” Zhu said – farm operators who are courting customers without having the actual farm built in advance.  These players are hoping to gather money and equipment from customers upfront as the initial capital to build the infrastructure, Zhu said. To him, this strategy is “very unreliable” because “they are promising to build something out of thin air.”  Fundamental Labs’ Yuan agreed, saying there’s a limited supply of new cryptocurrency mining equipment from manufacturers. He added:  “Mining farm operators may have overestimated the attractiveness of the water season, so the total supply of available equipment slots at mining farms is outnumbering the total supply of mining machines.”  New models  Indeed, while major mining equipment manufacturers have launched more powerful machines this year, few have been able to ship market-ready products at a large scale.  For instance, Bitewei, or MicroBT as the firm brands itself in English, launched the WhatsMiner M20S in April with a hashing power as high as 70TH/s while consuming as little as 48 watts of power per hash.  MicroBT founder Zuoxing Yang told CoinDesk that 1,000 to 2,000 of these will be available for shipment in May but orders larger than 10,000 units have to wait until July and August.  Similarly, miners who order InnoSilicon’s newest model T3, priced at $1,580 with a hash power of 43TH/s, will also have to wait until June for shipment.  Bitmain, on the other hand, has rolled out its flagship AntMiner S17 and S17 Pro in recent months but the first batch won’t be shipped until sometime in May and those are already marked as sold out. It also appears that Bitmain is holding up some of its S17 products as it is selling the hash power of these machines via cloud mining contracts, as advertised on its website.  But as powerful as these new machines appear to be, their payback period is still longer than that of secondhand machines, given their higher costs and a lower bitcoin price compared to the bull market of 2017.  “Miner makers also largely rely on the bitcoin price to decide on their production scale,” Zhong said, concluding:  “Unless bitcoin’s price can keep steadily above $8,000, otherwise, miner makers won’t likely be producing their latest, more powerful equipment at a large scale.”  Bitmain AntMiner image via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/03/bitcoin-minings-new-bidding-war,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a065b6d460944f7ccd94c559c8b485351ecb1b2-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Notably, Facebook is said to be aiming to eliminate the swipe and card processing fees, generally around 2–3 percent, paid by merchants on every transaction to banks and payments processors and networks. “If it succeeds, the project threatens the card networks’ dominance over global payments,” the WSJ says.  Last December, reports suggested the social media giant may first focus on the Indian market to let users transfer money via the fiat-pegged cryptocurrency on WhatsApp, the messaging app Facebook acquired in 2014.  Barclays analyst Ross Sandler recently estimated that Facebook’s cryptocurrency project could yield anywhere from $3 billion to $19 billion in additional revenue by 2021.  The firm set up its blockchain division in May 2018, purportedly to explore the technology. Since then, the company has been expanding its blockchain team with new hires. It currently has around 22 open positions related to blockchain, including legal experts, data engineers, marketing managers and more.  Earlier this year, Facebook also hired staffers from Chainspace, a startup specializing in scaling blockchains via a process known as sharding.
