42380292,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Mfqt,1516538417,Contortions for Compliance: Life Under New York's BitLicense,"Sarah H. Brennan, a corporate and securities attorney, leads the blockchain technology, cryptocurrency and digital assets practice team at Lippes Mathias Wexler Friedman LLP.      In June 2015, in a race to be a first mover in the space, the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) enacted the BitLicense regulatory framework, a licensing regime that covers substantially all ""virtual currency business activity"" to the extent it touches New York or its residents.  Namely, any business engaging in virtual currency business activity involving New York State or persons that reside, are located, have a place of business, or are conducting business in New York must apply for the BitLicense, with no grace periods or de minimis exceptions.  To the extent a business makes it through the licensing process and receives a BitLicense, as a whopping four businesses have to date (in addition to two companies who undertook the application process and received trust charters), the BitLicense imposes significant operational burdens, requiring robust compliance policies and processes with respect to anti-fraud, anti-money-laundering, cybersecurity, privacy and information security, among other requirements.  As such, the BitLicense has prompted flight from New York by larger players such as Bitfinex and Shapeshift and has had a chilling effect on others acting in an abundance of caution.  For those of us who remain in New York because we happen to live here, there is a widespread sense of confusion as to the scope of activities which fall under the purview of the regulations given: their vague wording, requirements that seem positioned toward financial institutions and the lack of formal guidance in the wake of the enactment of the regulations.  In all, uncertainty as to the reach of the licensing requirement has left many companies with three options: avoid doing business in New York entirely, attempt to structure a business around the law, or engage in potential or outright non-compliance with the law.  Based on the fact that DFS has received so few applicants to date, and has only five rejected applications on file, one could infer that many are electing non-compliance.  Case studies  Drone Energy and Travel by Token are two Empire State-based clients of mine running very different businesses, but with the common concern of operating in line with best practices.  These businesses, in addition to complying with applicable foreign, federal and state regulatory regimes (existing and as they develop), are expending a significant amount of time and energy to structure around the BitLicense.  For example, Drone Energy has a patented solution and an innovative business model designed around mining cryptocurrency. While it would be helpful for this exemption to have been explicit in the text of the BitLicense regulations, DFS has indicated in public comments that mining activities are categorically outside the scope of the law.  However, the business will at some point look to exit to U.S. dollars without tripping into the definition of ""virtual currency business activities."" This has been limiting as we have discussed various potential business models but something our client is able and willing to work around.  The other client, Travel by Token (TBT), is an early-stage start-up that uses an AirBnB/timeshare hybrid model for vacation stays, providing token holders access to vacation properties purchased and held by the company for the exclusive use of token holders at below-market prices.  As the token is in the development stage, we are in the clear to develop the underlying software in New York State under the BitLicense regulations. But the company will need to leave the state before commencing a token offering and hazarding being deemed to be ""controlling, administering, [and/]or issuing a Virtual Currency"" under Section 200.2(q)(5) of the BitLicense regulations.  While providing a viable path forward, structuring business plans and transactions to avoid the BitLicense is not a small or inexpensive undertaking.  For an example of how regulations interact, given the developments in securities laws over the course of December alone, in order to conduct a utility token offering (whether for Travel by Token or for another New York State-based client) we are considering the following as a potential workaround to the BitLicense as it interacts with applicable securities laws:  Structuring an initial offering as a 506(c)-compliant Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) offering, using a third-party service provider to verify accredited investors and for AML/KYC compliance, to the extent we do initial raises in New York because the SAFT, while squarely an investment contract subject to securities laws, should not trip the BitLicense as no tokens are issued;  Use funds raised in SAFT offering to continue to develop the token and move the business out-of-state and/or build out the organizational structure and form an affiliate to conduct the offering in a friendlier jurisdiction;  Subsequent to reorganizing the business, in the next iteration of funding, through a token offering:  At the time of the token offering, we would evaluate the state of securities laws with respect to whether utility tokens that are immediately usable in exchange for a service or product constitute securities in the eyes of the Securities and Exchange Commission and/or state regulators. This would inform us as to whether there is a need to comply with securities laws in the larger offering. However, even if we take the position that a token is not a security based on the Howey test, we would likely expend the effort to produce offering materials with robust securities law type disclosures;  We would, absent DFS guidance, plan to block New York State residents (and any others in jurisdictions that give rise to compliance concerns) from participating because, taking a conservative approach, all issuers will likely need a BitLicense to conduct any sort of token offering if based in the state or offering to state residents.        The above process only relates to fundraising and is based on the current state of the law as we understand it (literally) today.  New York passed the BitLicense regulations in a regulatory vacuum and now state and federal laws are catching up to it, oftentimes with less-than-stellar coordination between regulators, causing a compliance nightmare.  Next steps  Absent a successful challenge to the BitLicense regulations in court, and short of the DFS (or the state legislature) reworking the rules in line with the Uniform Law Commission frameworkhttp://www.uniformlaws.org/Committee.aspx?title=Regulation%20of%20Virtual%20Currency%20Businesses%20Act, it would be helpful for the DFS to issue more expansive guidance than the bare-bones FAQs posted on its website.  We will also learn the limits of the law the hard way – through enforcement actions, though there have been none to date.  However, further clarification (in whatever form it takes) should provide comfort in the space and limit further exits as well as complex structuring exercises.

42380296,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Mfuf,1516536306,Public Blockchains' Lure Will Become Irresistible for Enterprises in 2018,"Paul Brody is a principal and global innovation leader for blockchain technology at EY.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      Say what you will about Cryptokitties, but the app does something today that nearly all enterprise blockchains still cannot: exchange one item of value, a cryptokitty, for another item of value, ether.  That item of value may be silly (a digital kitten), but to those who care about them, it's really enough.  More importantly, the entire contract and transaction, including the exchange of product, takes place on the ethereum blockchain. At EY, our hypothesis is that this kind of low-friction, closed-loop economic transaction is, in fact, the ultimate end game for most enterprise blockchain aspirations.  We're still very far from that destination, however.  Right now, many enterprise blockchains are still operating like distributed databases and notary services, often with very specialized objectives, such as tracking product provenance. This is a useful start, but if we are not careful, it could be a dead end — a fancy, hacker-proof database, where the software company has replaced the central bank as the intermediary of choice.  To deliver on the full promise of blockchain technology, we believe that enterprises must embrace the full power of tokenization, and ultimately, the allure of the public network. And, 2018 is the year that this will come into view as the future of this technology.  Time for tokens  The foundation of this high-value future is the concept of tokenization: representing a company's products and services as digital tokens on a blockchain, not merely as items of information, but as carriers of value.  Such digital tokens can stand for anything from pharmaceuticals to phones to music. Whatever they are, they should have assigned ownership and value. If you have a pallet of 1,000 mobile phones, each worth $1,000, that's on a ship in transit, the blockchain should represent that with 1,000 small tokens with a collective value of $1 million.  When products are made, delivered or sold, value in the blockchain can change hands: 1,000 phone tokens for $1 million in U.S. dollar tokens. Not just bitcoin or ether, but U.S. dollar. Or euros or yen for that matter.  Set aside the debate about the value of traditional fiat vs. cryptocurrencies for the long run. The simple fact is that enterprise CFOs want to be paid the same currencies in which they have expenses and long-term liabilities.  That means tokenizing traditional fiat currency and doing so in the same blockchain as the products and services are tokenized.  Having both types of tokens in the same blockchain is critical — it is what enables the seamless, low-friction and low-risk exchange of items of value. Cross-chain connections are a nice idea, but they can't beat the power and simplicity of direct exchange.  Central banks are already experimenting with the tokenization of their own currencies, but doing so in private, permissioned or proprietary blockchains that are managed by the central banks. It is a good start, but the next logical step is to create the legal and regulatory framework that enables the tokenization of fiat currency on any industrial or public blockchain.  Once a closed-loop tokenized industrial blockchain exists, many of the key foundations of specialized blockchains would become add-on features in the true economic blockchain. Trade finance is easy if you trust that the representation of 1,000 phones, each worth $1,000 is accurate — you can loan money against those tokens in the blockchain.  Similarly, customs declarations, tax calculations, and product history and provenance are all easily derived from looking at the history of the tokens in that blockchain. No separate blockchain is required for trade finance, payments or product traceability.  Next steps  This vision of the future will start arriving in 2018, and it will have two clear stages.  The first will be the development of what we are call full cycle economic blockchains, where products and services are tokenized and exchanged through digital smart contracts for digital currency tokens. This foundation will likely start with sales, procurement and logistics, and will then go on to see the addition of related services, such as trade finance.  The second phase of this will be the gradual emergence of public blockchains as the preferred ecosystems for these transactions.  We believe that decentralized public blockchains are the only way by which enterprises will truly and deeply commit to digitizing their products and services in a fully interoperable manner. No company will want a centralized intermediary to become the main point of exchange for trillions of dollars in products and services: that entity will have far too much power as a natural monopoly, protected by powerful network effects.  This second phase will depend on how quickly transaction privacy tools such as zero-knowledge proofs (and related zk-snarks and zk-starks) mature.  Right now, transaction scalability and data privacy are not yet ready for multiple competing enterprises to put their strategic transactions into a public blockchain and feel confident they are secure, but that those risks will start to fade in 2018.  Beyond privacy, there are still many challenges to making public blockchains usable for enterprises, including how to implement the rule of law and related know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering regulations.  We believe these are solvable problems and that they can be addressed without the need for centralization. We're already testing our ideas of how to audit decentralized fiat currency tokens on public networks in ways that will company with AML and KYC rules, for example.  In the end, the lure of the public blockchain network is overwhelming. It's the only place where companies can be sure they are being treated fairly on a transparent, inspectable and open playing field.  In 2018, the foundations for this future will emerge and the first pilots of these concepts will be visible on the world's public blockchain networks.
