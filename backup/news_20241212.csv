The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Lunex Network, a new protocol, is attracting Avalanche and XRP investors as their prices lose strength. Table of Contents XRP braces for price correction Avalanche introduces Avalanche9000 Lunex Network to deliver extensive trader benefits Avalanche (AVAX) and Ripple (XRP) have both seen losses this week. This hasn’t come as a shock for Avalanche, as the project has struggled to gain momentum this year. For XRP, this loss could mark the end of the asset’s wild ride, having rallied last month. Meanwhile, Lunex Network (LNEX) has been gaining traction in the trading space for its modern approach to crypto. It promises to address long-time trader frustrations by offering low fees, strong interoperability, and powerful trading tools. XRP braces for price correction XRP is down 6% in the last 24 hours and 7% in the last week. Many experts expect corrective price action as XRP saw wild growth throughout November, rallying by 300%. The XRP price growth likely occurred as a result of Trump’s appointment, pointing towards a more favorable regulatory climate for crypto platforms in the near future. Ripple has also worked hard to improve its ledger and is now seen as a real authority in the cross-border payment space. Avalanche introduces Avalanche9000 Avalanche added 31% to its value over the year, a level of growth dwarfed by the wider crypto market expansion. AVAX is still slowing down and possibly heading downward after dropping 12% in 24 hours and 13% in the last week. Despite the underwhelming price performance, Avalanche has released some well received updates. Specifically, the Avalanche9000 upgrade was recently released on the testnet and is set to bring flexibility and scalability to the network. This will make Avalanche a more hospitable place for developers looking to build intelligent and scalable decentralized applications.

37563174,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626795,1734047141,Google and Harvard debut dataset with 1m public domain books for AI training,"Harvard University, in conjunction with Google, has released a dataset of a million public domain books to train the next generation of AI. The books span genres, languages, and authors such as Dickens, Dante, and Shakespeare which are no longer copyright protected because of their age. The new dataset initiative comes as AI training data is naturally pricey and best suited for tech firms with deep pockets. Harvard got financial backing from tech giants According to a TechCrunch article, the initiative is spearheaded by the Harvard’s Institutional Data Initiative (IDI). This initiative contains books derived from Google’s longstanding book-scanning project Google Books . Other books contained in the dataset include Czech math textbooks and Welsh pocket dictionaries. The university teased the IDI in March clearly stating its plans to create a “trusted conduit for legal data for AI.” Since then, not much was heard from it until the formal launch on Thursday and tech giants Microsoft and OpenAI funded the project. The dataset is not a preserve of Silicon Valley alone but IDI has opened it to anyone, that is from research labs to AI startups that want to train their large language models. By opening the dataset to anyone, IDI executive director Greg Leppert said the dataset is meant to level the playing field, at a time when the cost of training AI remains high and prohibitive to smaller companies and making it preserve of those with huge budgets. Leppert added that the dataset is “rigorously reviewed,” which according to Fudzilla presumably means someone checked to ensure that Bard was really gone and out of the way. The Harvard dataset will need more resources According to Leppert, who compared the dataset’s potential to Linux, the open source operating system, the success of the Harvard dataset will be hinged on a number of variables. Leppert said its success will require more resources, expertise, and a “sprinkle of magic” from those same deep-pocketed corporations that the initiative is designed to challenge. The million books contained in the dataset were scanned as part of Google Books program. Fudzilla describes the initiative as a digital time capsule from when Google’s ambitions to scan every book seemed quirky rather than dystopian. However, Leppert is upbeat about the project’s potential uses, further suggesting it could a such a treasure trove helping train AI models for everyone from garage startups to the corporate conglomerates. While some have praised the initiative as a revolutionary leap forward in democratizing AI, Fudzilla opines that some might see this as a subtle means of ensuring that any ambitious upstart with a few terabytes of server space can now compete in a race to develop the next ChatGPT. However, they will need more resources to compete and make a dent in the market. ChatGPT launched in November 2022 to immediate success, which spurred the race for generative AI models across the globe. However, the development of these models has created a thirst for data to perfect them and this desire for more data has caused problems on how much information they can get, without stealing it. To date, publishers like the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times have sued OpenAI and Perplexity over using their data without permission.

After months of speculation, Bitcoin surged past the $100,000 mark, thrilling both long-time HODLers and fresh investors alike. The cherry on top? Bitcoin ETFs are witnessing a steady influx of funds, showing a renewed wave of institutional confidence. Fidelity, ARK, and Grayscale are leading the charge, with millions flowing into their ETFs as BTC maintains its climb. Meanwhile, Ethereum is quietly but powerfully making its case, with analysts eyeing the $5,000 milestone thanks to growing demand and tightening supply dynamics. It’s a bullish December for crypto, and the buzz is palpable. Amid this surge, Qubetics ($TICS) has been making waves of its own. Unlike many speculative projects, Qubetics aims to solve real-world challenges by bringing asset tokenisation into the mainstream. Qubetics: Transforming Real-World Asset Tokenisation Qubetics is all about solving real-world problems for real people. Ever thought about how clunky and fragmented the process of managing real-world assets can be? That’s where Qubetics comes in. It’s all about tokenising real-world assets —from real estate to intellectual property—and making them tradable on the blockchain. Picture this: a small business owner needs to raise capital but doesn’t want to go through the red tape of traditional financing. With Qubetics, they can tokenise their inventory or even future revenue streams. Investors get a piece of the action, and the business gets liquidity. Qubetics lets them do just that, creating a win-win for creators and fans. For more information, check out this exclusive AMA Session . The numbers don’t lie. The Qubetics presale is in its 12th stage, with over 313 million $TICS tokens sold to more than 8,700 holders, raising a staggering $5.7 million so far. At just $0.0311 per token, it’s an entry point that screams potential. The prices are set to jump by 10% this weekend. If you’ve been waiting for a sign to dive in, this is it. Qubetics isn’t just another crypto platform; it’s a revolution. By bridging the gap between physical and digital assets, it’s opening doors that were previously bolted shut. Whether you’re a business, a professional, or just someone looking to diversify their portfolio, Qubetics offers a fresh, innovative approach to asset management. And with its presale momentum showing no signs of slowing down, the time to act is now. Bitcoin: The King Reclaims The Crown, Smashes $100K Barrier Bitcoin is smashing through ceilings, and $100,000 isn’t just another number—it’s a statement. After years of scepticism, the flagship cryptocurrency has cemented itself as more than just digital gold. What’s fuelling this latest rally? It’s the ETFs, baby. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States have been on fire, pulling in $223 million in just one day. Fidelity’s FBTC, ARK’s ARKB, and Grayscale’s GBTC are attracting cash like a magnet, proving institutional investors are in it for the long haul. This ETF frenzy didn’t come out of nowhere. It’s a mix of perfect timing and a maturing market. Inflation data has eased fears of aggressive rate hikes, nudging the Fed toward a potential cut. That’s music to Bitcoin’s ears. Add to that a trading volume of $3.94 billion for BTC investment products, and you’ve got a market roaring with optimism. But let’s keep it real. Bitcoin isn’t just about big-shot ETFs and six-figure price tags. For the everyday investor, it’s about resilience and reliability. Think about it: Bitcoin has outperformed most traditional assets this year. Whether you’re stacking sats or eyeing a long-term hold, Bitcoin’s recent performance is a masterclass in staying power. And if history is any guide, the king’s reign is far from over. Ethereum: Gearing Up for a Big Break While Bitcoin grabs headlines, Ethereum is quietly orchestrating a rally of its own. Hovering around $5,000, ETH is poised for what could be its most significant breakout yet. Why? It’s all about the fundamentals. Since the introduction of spot ETFs in July, institutional demand for Ethereum has surged. Over 3.41 million ETH are now held in these funds, up from 2.716 million just a few months ago. That’s a whole lot of confidence from big-money players. Then there’s Ethereum’s supply story. With every transaction burning ETH, the network is seeing deflationary forces at play. Higher activity on the blockchain means more ETH gets removed from circulation. It’s like a double-edged sword that only sharpens the asset’s scarcity. And speaking of activity, Ethereum’s daily transactions are off the charts, with smart contracts and dApps fuelling the ecosystem like never before. But here’s where Ethereum gets really interesting: its adaptability. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum isn’t just a store of value; it’s the backbone of decentralised finance, NFTs, and so much more. Whether you’re a DeFi junkie or a casual dApp user, ETH offers a slice of something bigger. With its realised price hovering around $5,200, the stars seem to be aligning for a push past $5K. Could this be the moment Ethereum leaves its mark as more than Bitcoin’s little brother? It sure feels like it. Make Your Move This December, the crypto market is buzzing with opportunities. Bitcoin’s climb past $100K proves it’s still the king of the hill, while Ethereum’s deflationary dynamics set the stage for a major rally. But if you’re looking for the next big thing, Qubetics presale offers a chance to get in early on a project that’s truly breaking new ground. Don’t let this moment pass you by. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or just dipping your toes in the crypto waters, these three options are shaping up to be the best cryptos to invest in this month. Act now, and let your portfolio ride the wave.

This is significant, considering how it could set Shiba Inu on a path to higher prices. Most SHIB Holders In The Green As Shiba Inu Price Rebounds IntoTheBlock data shows that most SHIB holders are in the green as the Shiba Inu price rebounds towards $0.00003. 69% of these SHIB holders are now in the money, while 24% are out of the money, and 6% are currently in the money. This could be bullish for the Shiba Inu price, considering that holders are less likely to sell when they are in the money. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Last Phase Of ABC Wave Points To A Bounce To New ATH At $5.85 This could reduce the selling pressure on SHIB and sustain the Shiba Inu price recovery. The meme coin has recovered towards $0.00003. The ‘In the Money’ metric shows that the next significant resistance level that Shiba Inu needs to break above is $0.000033. 130,620 wallet addresses bought 15.06 trillion SHIB tokens around this level. However, on-chain metrics still paint a bearish picture for Shiba Inu, which is undoubtedly concerning. IntoTheBlock data shows that the ‘Concentration’ metric is in the red, indicating that SHIB whales currently have a bearish sentiment towards the meme coin and are opting against accumulating more coins. This large transaction metric is also bearish at the moment as Shiba Inu whales are opting against accumulating more coins. The net network growth also paints a bearish picture for the Shiba Inu price, as there is currently a low influx of new addresses buying the meme coin. The Shiba Inu burn rate has also remained inconsistent, further presenting a bearish outlook for the Shiba Inu price. Shibburn data shows that the burn rate is down over 79% in the last 24 hours, with three million coins burned during this period. From A Technical Analysis Perspective Crypto analyst Javon Marks has provided a bullish outlook for Shiba Inu from a technical analysis perspective. In an X post, he stated that Shiba Inu recently confirmed another bullish pattern, which could lead to a continuation of its upward trend. The analyst added that another major upside move could be in play for SHIB, with the meme coin possibly rallying to $0.00081 or even higher. Related Reading: Weekly Bull Flag Appears On XRP Price Chart, Why A Double-Digit Is Still Feasible The crypto analyst further mentioned that with this target at $0.000081, the Shiba Inu price could witness a 180% climb and that this rally may already be in play. A rally to $0.000081 could pave the way for Shiba Inu to surpass its current all-time high (ATH) of $0.000088.

37564874,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319086,1734046200,Japanese Lawmaker Asks Government to Create National Bitcoin Reserve,"A Japanese lawmaker has asked the government to launch a national Bitcoin reserve, echoing similar recent calls from MPs in Argentina , Russia , and beyond. Per the media outlet CoinPost and the official House of Councillors record , the demand came from Satoshi Hamada, an MP from the Party to Protect the People from NHK. A National Bitcoin Reserve for Japan? Hamada submitted a written question to the government “regarding the creation of a reserve fund for cryptoassets.” Japanese lawmaker Satoshi Hamada In the question, the lawmaker noted there moves are now afoot “in Brazil and the United States,” where Treasury officials could soon begin holding Bitcoin (BTC) as a “strategic reserve asset.” Hamada went on to ask the Japanese government to “consider converting part of its foreign exchange reserves into virtual currencies such as Bitcoin.” He added that the incoming Donald Trump administration will appoint a so-called crypto “czar” and explained that “similar movements are also underway in Brazil.” The lawmaker mentioned that BTC could soon become a “national strategic asset.” He submitted his request in a document entitled: “Question regarding the status of understanding the movement to introduce a national Bitcoin reserve in the United States and other countries.” Decentralized Solution Hamada’s question also made note of the fact that BTC is “less susceptible to the influence of specific countries or institutions.” And he said that its “neutrality and decentralized nature” allows Bitcoin to support economic activity” without “relying on any specific currency.” The government is set to provide Hamada with a written response in the coming weeks, and will likely publish this on its official website. A new risk for the yen is emerging, with currency strategists in Tokyo warning that there’s a chance the Bank of Japan may stand pat on interest rates until March or later https://t.co/tUNZ6lFvSM — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) December 12, 2024 Lawmakers Share Sentiment? Hamada represents a political party that only has two seats in parliament. But there is a high probability that other MPs share Hamada’s views. Japan’s relatively restrictive regulations have resulted in a shrinking crypto market. But many top lawmakers still want to turn the nation into a global blockchain hotspot. They have urged Tokyo to reform crypto tax laws and prevent promising crypto startups from relocating overseas. Meanwhile, the business sector is growing increasingly Bitcoin-keen, with some Japanese firms using their balance sheet to buy BTC and altcoins .

37562375,https://crypto.news/?p=14318718,1734045780,"What Bitwise knows about Bitcoin’s $200,000 prediction and why it matters to you?","Could 2025 be the year Bitcoin hits $200,000, crypto unicorns debut on Wall Street, and tokenized assets go mainstream? Let’s understand why. The crypto market in 2024 has been nothing short of transformative, with major milestones taking center stage throughout the year. Against this backdrop, Bitwise has made a series of bold predictions for 2025, bringing into focus the next big trends in the industry. Let’s dive into the details of each prediction and unravel the market conditions to assess how realistic these forecasts are and what they could mean for the future of the industry. Table of Contents Bitcoin’s rise fueled by ETFs and adoption Coinbase and MicroStrategy’s market potential Crypto’s path into 401(k) plans Stablecoins and tokenized assets The road ahead Bitcoin’s rise fueled by ETFs and adoption The first of these claims is that Bitcoin ( BTC ) will soar beyond $200,000 in 2025. To put this in perspective, Bitcoin is trading at $100,500 levels as of Dec. 12, a minor step back from its all-time high of $103,900 achieved just a week ago on Dec. 5. BTC Price Chart | Source: crypto.news This dip, marking a 3.5% retreat, comes on the heels of a broader market correction following an extraordinary bull run earlier in the year. Bitcoin first broke its previous all-time high of $73,000 in March, setting off a wave of optimism that reached a crescendo in November when Donald Trump was elected the 47th President of the U.S. His administration’s perceived pro-crypto stance has injected fresh confidence into the market. While the recent pullback may have tempered the frenzy, the overarching bullish sentiment remains intact. Adding fuel to this optimism is the explosive growth in Bitcoin ETFs , which Bitwise predicts will attract even more inflows in 2025 than they did in 2024. Since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs at the start of this year, total assets under management across these ETFs have reached an astonishing $113 billion as of Dec. 12, according to CoinGlass. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has emerged as the frontrunner, drawing in the lion’s share of inflows. In just the past week, a record-breaking $3.85 billion flowed into digital asset funds, with BlackRock accounting for $2.6 billion of that total. Bitwise’s third prediction ties closely to the first two, forecasting that the number of countries holding Bitcoin will double by 2025. The idea of nation-states accumulating Bitcoin is not new, but it is gaining traction as governments recognize its potential as a reserve asset. Currently, eight nations hold Bitcoin, with the U.S. leading the pack with over 207,000 BTC, valued at more than $20.6 billion as of today. China follows closely, holding 194,000 BTC worth $19.3 billion. Other notable holders include the United Kingdom, Ukraine, Bhutan, and El Salvador, with holdings ranging from a few thousand to tens of thousands of BTC. Collectively, all these nations control 529,558 BTC, which is roughly 2.52% of Bitcoin’s total supply of 21 million coins. If the number of countries holding Bitcoin does indeed double, we could see a profound shift in geopolitical strategies, with Bitcoin serving as a new kind of reserve asset. Coinbase and MicroStrategy’s market potential Bitwise’s next set of predictions for 2025 claims that Coinbase (COIN) stock will exceed $700 per share by 2025. Currently trading at $313, Coinbase has seen a 100% year-to-date gain. For context, Coinbase’s all-time high was $429.54, achieved during its debut on April 13, 2021, while its lowest point came on January 5, 2023, at $31.55. From its all-time low to today’s price, the stock has surged by over 900%, showing a dramatic turnaround. However, achieving the predicted $700 mark would require an additional 120% increase. Another fascinating prediction centers on Coinbase’s potential entry into the S&P 500 and MicroStrategy’s potential inclusion in the Nasdaq-100. For Coinbase, joining the prestigious S&P 500 would signify its maturation as a blue-chip stock, reserved for companies with a market capitalization exceeding $18 billion and meeting specific profitability criteria. While Coinbase has faced volatility since its IPO, its strong recovery in 2023 and consistent performance in 2024 make it a viable candidate for the index. On the other hand, MicroStrategy’s transformation from a business software company to a corporate Bitcoin pioneer has redefined its market presence, with its stock price climbing 500% year-to-date, trading at $411 levels as of this writing, down from its 52-week high of $543. The idea of MicroStrategy joining the Nasdaq-100 and possibly the S&P 500 has generated considerable buzz. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the company is a strong contender for the Nasdaq-100, with an announcement expected soon. $MSTR is likely to be added to $QQQ on 12/23 (w/ announcement coming 12/13). Moderna likely to get boot (symbolic). Below is best guess of adds/drops via @JSeyff . Likely a 0.47% weight (40th biggest holding). There's $550b of ETFs tracking the index. S&P 500 add next yr prob. pic.twitter.com/rmTavtvWQL — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 10, 2024 However, its inclusion in the S&P 500 remains more challenging due to stricter criteria and the index committee’s selective approach. Another exciting prediction for 2025 is that at least five crypto unicorns will go public in the U.S. With around 30 crypto unicorns currently operating in the U.S. — including well-known names like Ripple ( XRP ), OpenSea, and Chainalysis —t he pipeline for potential IPOs is robust. An influx of crypto-related IPOs would not only provide new investment opportunities but also signal the sector’s maturation as it transitions from niche to mainstream. Crypto’s path into 401(k) plans Bitwise’s next prediction for 2025 revolves around the U.S. Department of Labor potentially relaxing its current guidance against including crypto in 401(k) retirement plans. To understand the potential impact, it’s important to first unpack the current state of affairs and why crypto in retirement accounts has been a contentious issue. As of now, the Department of Labor maintains a cautious stance toward crypto in retirement plans. In March 2022, the agency issued a compliance bulletin warning fiduciaries to exercise “extreme care” when allowing cryptocurrencies in 401(k) offerings. The DOL raised concerns about the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies, their price volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and the risks of fraud and theft. The agency argued that these factors make digital assets unsuitable for most retirement savers, whose investment horizons are long and whose risk tolerance is generally low. Under this guidance, the inclusion of crypto in 401(k) plans has been rare. A few instances of integration, such as Fidelity’s introduction of a Bitcoin option for its 401(k) plans in 2022, faced immediate scrutiny. The DOL cautioned Fidelity and other firms offering similar products to ensure compliance with fiduciary duties, effectively discouraging broader adoption. Employers have been hesitant to expose themselves to potential liability, resulting in a limited presence of crypto within retirement portfolios. If the prediction of relaxed guidance in 2025 comes true, it would mark a major policy reversal. Such a shift would likely be driven by growing demand from younger generations of workers who see crypto as a legitimate asset class. Surveys have consistently shown that millennials and Gen Z investors view crypto as a vital component of their long-term financial strategies. For example, a 2023 Charles Schwab study found that 47% of millennials already hold crypto in some capacity, and 45% expressed interest in including it in their retirement accounts if given the option. The potential market impact of this change is enormous. According to the Investment Company Institute, U.S. 401(k) plans held approximately $7.7 trillion in assets as of December 2023. Even a small percentage of this being allocated to cryptocurrencies could inject heavy liquidity into the market and further legitimize the space. Stablecoins and tokenized assets Bitwise’s predictions for 2025 also include a bold outlook on the stablecoin market and the tokenized real-world assets space. The first projection foresees stablecoin assets doubling to over $400 billion, a substantial leap from their current market capitalization of $207 billion as of Dec. 12. Tether ( USDT ) dominates this market with a commanding share of approximately 67.6%, backed by its $140 billion market cap. USDT’s closest competitor, USD Coin ( USDC ), lags behind with a market cap of $41 billion, making it roughly 3.4 times smaller. Stablecoins are frequently used as trading pairs on exchanges, providing a bridge between crypto assets and fiat currencies. Moreover, their role in facilitating cross-border transactions has also gained attention, particularly in regions with limited access to traditional banking services. The second prediction centers on the tokenized real-world asset market, which is expected to reach $50 billion by 2025. According to a September 2024 Binance report, the total value of tokenized RWAs hit an all-time high of over $12 billion, excluding stablecoins. https://twitter.com/BinanceResearch/status/1834531941594599756 RWAs refer to blockchain-based representations of physical and financial assets such as real estate, government bonds, commodities, and even fine art. Tokenization allows these assets to be divided into smaller units, making them more accessible to a wider range of investors. Key categories in the RWA space include tokenized U.S. Treasuries, private credit, and real estate, with emerging categories such as carbon credits and air rights also gaining traction. Traditional asset managers have already begun to tokenize illiquid assets like real estate or fine art to offer investors opportunities to diversify their holdings in ways that were previously challenging or cost-prohibitive. A McKinsey report from June 2024 estimates that the tokenized market could grow to $2 trillion by 2030, underpinned by increasing demand for transparency, efficiency, and fractional ownership in financial markets. The road ahead The future of the crypto market looks exciting, with Bitwise’s 2025 predictions pointing to major shifts ahead. Bitcoin could hit new highs, stablecoins could double in value, and tokenized real-world assets could gain traction as the next big thing. But these changes will depend on how the market grows, how regulations evolve, and how technology keeps up. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Earlier this week, a Dogecoin monitoring platform noticed that the number of DOGE nodes dipped from 647 to just 205, a decrease of about 69%. “Our monitoring made us aware that the vulnerability appears to have been exploited, and almost 69% of the Dogecoin network has crashed. Blockchair shows the number of public nodes. Before, it was 647, and at the time of writing it is just 205.” However, according to Blockchair, some DOGE nodes have since recovered as there are currently 331 active nodes around the world at time of writing. In a recent thread on the social media platform X, Bitcoin ( BTC ) sidechain developer Andreas Kohl says that he was the one who took down most of the DOGE network using an old laptop. “I used a publicly disclosed vulnerability [by BTC developer Tobias Ruck] to take down 69% of the Dogecoin network from an old thinkpad in rural El Salvador.” According to Kohl, most DOGE users didn’t even notice . “Only nodes that weren’t on the latest version were affected – which was the majority of the network, excluding CEXs (centralized exchanges) and most other major custodians – hence why most doge users never noticed, not that many understand self-custody.” News of the exploit had little impact on the price of DOGE as the meme asset is trading for $0.413 at time of writing, a 4.7% decrease during the last 24 hours.

This shift comes as these experienced players look beyond established tokens to capitalize on undervalued assets with game-changing potential. With projections of a massive 29,000% return, PCHAIN could outshine major cryptocurrencies and redefine what it means to invest early in a high-utility project. Cardano Whales Shift Focus: Why PropiChain is Their Next Big Target Cardano has long been a powerhouse in the cryptocurrency space, with its innovative proof-of-stake protocol and focus on sustainability. It’s no surprise that whales continue to see its value. However, even as Cardano holds strong, these experienced investors are looking for opportunities to deliver more explosive returns, which is where PropiChain enters the picture. The whales’ interest in PropiChain is a clear indicator of its potential. Large-scale investors often have access to advanced analytics and industry insights, meaning their moves can serve as a beacon for others. PropiChain addresses inefficiencies in property transactions and captures attention in ways most altcoins can’t. For everyday investors, following the money might be the smartest move yet. PropiChain: Revolutionizing Real Estate Through Blockchain PropiChain stands out by addressing one of the world’s most lucrative markets through blockchain technology. PropiChain is redefining how people access and invest in property at its core by offering a suite of innovative features tailored to modern investment needs. Tokenized Real Estate : You can own a fraction of a high-end property without spending millions in capital. PropiChain’s tokenization model converts these properties into tokens, allowing you to buy small shares. This levels the playground for smaller investors to get in. This feature is perfect for individuals looking to diversify their portfolios without the hassle of traditional property ownership. Fractional Ownership : Gone are the days when real estate investing required hefty down payments and complex legal processes. With fractional ownership, an investor can own a percentage of a property for as little as a few thousand dollars, earning proportional returns from rent or value appreciation. AI-Powered Insights : PropiChain doesn’t just provide access to real estate, it equips investors with the tools to make smarter decisions. Its AI analytics platform offers predictive market trends, helping users identify high-growth areas before they explode in value. For example, the system might highlight a suburban market on the verge of a boom, giving early investors an edge. Metaverse Integration : Taking innovation further, PropiChain lets users explore properties virtually in its metaverse platform. This adds an interactive layer that traditional real estate platforms can’t match. PropiChain Presale’s 29,000% Growth Potential PropiChain is in its presale phase, offering a rare opportunity for early adopters to enter at a ground-floor price. The initial token price started at just $0.004 and has now risen to $0.011 in stage two. This structured presale model, combined with projections of 29,000% ROI, makes it an incredibly attractive proposition. Let’s break this down with a practical example: If you invested $1,000 in PropiChain during its presale, and the token hits its projected value, your investment could turn to $290,000. Compare this to Cardano, where similar returns are highly improbable due to its established market positions and limited room for explosive growth. PropiChain’s presale credibility is strengthened by its CMC listing and rigorous audits by BlockAudit, ensuring security and transparency. Moreover, the project has already raised over $1 million, with its first stage selling out rapidly. This demonstrates the immense interest and confidence in PropiChain’s vision. Conclusion PropiChain is rapidly becoming the talk of the crypto world, and for good reason. With the first presale already filled, it’s clear that this project is gaining traction and that it is time to act. Each passing day brings PropiChain closer to its next pricing stage, where early adopters will already see gains while new investors pay more. Secure your spot in the PropiChain presale today.

Second, Chainlink has forged significant partnerships in recent months. Earlier this week, the developers announced collaborations with Coinbase and Emirates NBD, a bank with over $200 billion in assets. Chainlink has also partnered with organizations like Swift Network. Notably, Swift recently conducted a large-scale tokenization trade with UBS, the world’s largest wealth manager. Swift plans to integrate Chainlink’s technology into its money movement business, which processes over $150 trillion annually.

According to reports, the move comes with a clear caveat: tax exemptions will not be part of the package. This development was revealed by Danylo Hetmantsev, Head of the Ukrainian Parliament Committee for Finances, Tax and Customs Policy, during the Domestic Investment Opportunities forum recently hosted by Ekonomichna Pravda. Crypto Legalisation Timeline and Legislative Progress Hetmantsev announced that a draft law, developed in close collaboration with the National Bank of Ukraine and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), is nearing completion. He mentioned that the draft is expected to be ready after the New Year, and the crypto legalization will be passed after that. This draft law builds on a milestone in November 2023, when Ukraine’s parliament introduced legislation on taxing virtual asset transactions. The passage of this new bill will mark the final step in creating a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the country. Similarly, Russia recently introduced a new crypto bill that focuses on crypto transactions. The bill aims to regulate digital assets and ensure compliance with financial laws. If Ukraine legalizes crypto in 2025, it will join countries such as the United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, Australia, and Switzerland. These nations have embraced virtual assets and implemented rules to manage risks and ensure compliance with tax and financial laws. The Taxation Model: No Special Privileges While legalizing digital assets is a significant move, the absence of tax exemptions reflects a cautious and practical approach. According to Hetmantsev, profits from crypto will be taxed under the same model applied to securities. Taxes will only be levied when assets are converted into traditional currency. This cautious approach aligns with international best practices, ensuring digital assets do not create loopholes in Ukraine’s tax system. Many countries, including the U.S., the U.K., Canada, and Germany, have adopted a similarly cautious approach to the taxation of digital assets. Ukraine in the Crypto Space Ukraine has been a prominent player in the global crypto landscape, making consistent strides toward integrating digital assets into its economy. In 2022, the Ukrainian Parliament passed the “On Virtual Assets” law , which provided a legal definition for cryptocurrencies and recognized them as an asset class. This law laid the groundwork for the current efforts toward full-scale legalization. Also, the Ministry of Digital Transformation has actively collaborated with international blockchain companies and tech giants to develop a robust digital economy. During the early days of the Russian invasion, Ukraine embraced crypto donations. This move showcased the practical utility of digital assets during crises. The initiative raised millions to support defense and humanitarian efforts. As the first quarter of 2025 approaches, all eyes will be on Ukraine as it navigates the challenges and opportunities of becoming a fully crypto-legal nation.

It’s a flexible and scalable platform designed for smart contracts. This means developers can build apps, tokens, and games on its blockchain. The native coin of Cardano is ADA. Like Ethereum’s ETH, ADA lets users store value, make payments, and support the network. What sets Cardano apart is its focus on being environmentally friendly. It uses a system called Ouroboros, which saves energy compared to other methods that use lots of power. The crypto market is paying attention to green technologies. Thus, Cardano’s eco-friendly approach gives it an edge over other coins. Additionally, its unique design allows for fast transactions, possibly up to a million per second. This is much quicker than many other blockchains. With the growing interest in decentralized finance and smart contracts, ADA could become even more important. While the market keeps changing, Cardano’s strong technology and focus on sustainability make it a cryptocurrency to watch. Toncoin Toncoin is the digital currency of The Open Network (TON), an open-source blockchain aiming for fast, secure payments with low fees. Initially developed by Telegram as the ‘Gram’ token for the Telegram Open Network, the project was halted in 2020 due to legal issues with the SEC. Since then, the non-profit TON Foundation and community enthusiasts have taken over. The network uses proof-of-stake, enhancing its scalability and reliability. TON is building a full ecosystem with decentralized storage services, domain names, private networking, and efficient payment systems. Looking ahead, Toncoin shows great potential. Based on past price trends and Bitcoin halving cycles, some predictions estimate Toncoin could reach up to $30.30 by 2025, a significant increase from today’s price. In the current market, where fast and secure payment solutions are in demand, Toncoin’s technology could make it stand out. Its focus on a comprehensive ecosystem and minimal fees might attract more users. Conclusion While ADA and TON are solid, XYZ stands out as the first all-sport meme coin uniting sports fans in a community-driven ecosystem aiming for 20,000% growth in the 2024 bull run.

Then, Alec Beckman from Advantage Blockchain answers questions about how AI, blockchain and crypto work together in Ask an Expert.  –S.M.  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Crypto X AI: Why Blockchain is the Secret Sauce for Mass AI Adoption  Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds transformative potential across industries and daily life, yet its mass adoption faces hurdles—resource intensity, ethical concerns, lack of customization, and challenges surrounding proof of humanhood. With its decentralization and resource coordination strengths, Blockchain provides a compelling solution to these challenges, paving the way for widespread AI integration.  The Challenges of AI Adoption  Resource Intensity: Developing advanced AI demands immense computational power, data, and expertise, favoring well-capitalized firms and sidelining smaller players.  Ethical Concerns: Centralized AI monetization often mirrors Web2’s exploitative model: “If you don’t pay for the product, you are the product.” This raises concerns about user privacy and data exploitation.  Lack of Customization: AI must address diverse, nuanced human needs. Standardized models frequently fail to provide tailored solutions, underscoring the necessity for adaptable, task-specific AI agents.  Proof of humanhood: As AI evolves, distinguishing human-generated content from machine output becomes increasingly difficult, leading to risks of misinformation and content piracy.  Blockchain: A Game-Changer for AI  Blockchains offer a compelling counterpoint to centralized AI development. Their open, permissionless nature and token-based incentives enable large-scale resource coordination, addressing AI’s most pressing challenges:  Decentralized Infrastructure: Projects like Render and Akash leverage token rewards to crowdsource global GPU power, offering competitive alternatives to centralized providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS). While reliability challenges persist, applications like Render’s image-rendering successes showcase blockchain's viability.  Open-Source Model Development: Platforms like Bittensor and AI Alliance incentivize AI model development using their platform tokens. By fostering innovation and reducing reliance on centralized funding, these platforms empower independent developers. Successful models can increase token value, creating a virtuous growth cycle.  Democratizing AI Agents: The emergence of decentralized AI agents marks blockchain’s strongest product-market fit in the AI space. These agents, trained on foundational models, require fewer resources than model development and can be tailored to specific use cases. For instance, Virtuals, an AI agent platform built on the Base blockchain, has launched over 2,000 agents within months. AI agent applications span gaming, DeFi and entertainment, with agents continuously improving through user interactions. Source: Dune Dashboard 12/6/2024  Identity and IP protection: Blockchain’s transparency and immutability make it a strong tool for storing and verifying identities and intellectual property (IP). Zero-knowledge proof technology enables privacy-preserving verification. Projects like Worldcoin illustrate blockchain's potential to address proof-of-humanhood concerns.  The Path Ahead: Blockchain Fills AI’s Missing Piece for Mass Adoption  Much like how YouTube and TikTok democratized content creation, blockchains enable the proliferation of crowd-sourced AI agents. These agents deliver personalized services while remaining independent of centralized commercial interests. Furthermore, blockchain could provide efficient payment rails, enabling autonomous agent-to-agent transactions without human or financial intermediaries.  Blockchains are more than a supporting actor in AI’s evolution—they are the critical enabler of a scalable, equitable, and user-centric AI economy. By addressing resource constraints, fostering ethical use, and enabling customization, blockchains and AI together have the potential to redefine how we live and work. As the foundation for an emerging agentic AI economy, this synergy marks the dawn of a transformative technological era.  - Kelly Ye, portfolio manager and head of research, Decentral Park Capital  Ask an Expert    Q. Why does AI need crypto and blockchain technology?  AI benefits from crypto and blockchain in several ways:  Data integrity: Blockchain ensures the authenticity of data used to train AI models, reducing the risk of manipulation.  Decentralization: Crypto-powered networks like Fetch.ai enable AI to operate on decentralized infrastructure, reducing reliance on centralized servers.  Monetization: Cryptocurrencies allow smooth microtransactions, allowing AI models to pay for data or services without intermediaries.  Transparency: Smart contracts make AI decisions traceable and auditable in public permissionless blockchains, fostering trust in AI-powered systems.  As AI interacts with other AI or humans, better data and improved sharing of monetary benefits can lead to more incentives and powerful interactions.  Q. Why do crypto and blockchain technology need AI?  AI can enhance crypto through:  Improved efficiency: AI can optimize blockchain networks by improving consensus mechanisms and reducing transaction costs.  Fraud detection: Machine learning models can detect suspicious activity and enhance security against hacks.  Market insights: AI-driven analytics aid investors by predicting price trends and analyzing market sentiment.  Tools like Virtuals Protocol can allow anyone to create an AI agent to improve their business inexpensively, provide market research, enhance workflows, scale, and more.  Q. What are the emerging opportunities at the intersection of AI and crypto?  DeFi automation: AI can optimize yield farming and liquidity provision strategies.  Tokenized AI models: Developers can tokenize and trade ownership of AI models on blockchain platforms.  Autonomous economies: AI agents use crypto for self-sustaining operations, such as managing decentralized energy grids or supply chains.  AI agents can provide immense value to individuals and companies by providing market research, finding good investments in the crypto world, and autonomously trading with a crypto wallet.  - Alec Beckman, co-founder and president, Advantage Blockchain  Keep Reading  Amazon shareholders petition the board to invest in bitcoin.

French Hill will lead the House Financial Services Committee and investigate debanking claims in the crypto sector. He aims to ensure crypto businesses have equal access to banking services. Hill also hopes to advance stablecoin regulation before 2024 ends. Rep. French Hill, an Arkansas Congressman, is set to become the next House Financial Services Committee Chairman following the retirement of current Chair Patrick McHenry. Hill, who has made a name for himself has already, outlined plans to investigate the controversial issue of debanking in the crypto sector. Rep. French Hill to lead investigation on crypto debanking claims In a recent post, Rep. Hill announced that one of his top priorities in the upcoming Congress will be thoroughly reviewing and scrutinizing the claims of crypto businesses being unfairly cut off from banking services. This issue has gotten attention in recent months, with many industry leaders, including venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, speaking out about federal authorities allegedly pressuring banks to close accounts linked to the cryptocurrency industry. Critics say these actions are similar to the Department of Justice’s “Operation Choke Point” from 2013, which tried to block banking services for industries seen as high-risk. Marc Andreessen, co-founder of a16z, highlighted these concerns recently on Joe Rogan’s podcast. He claimed that the U.S. government had pressured banks to close accounts associated with crypto and other industries, sparking widespread debate. During a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Dec. 3, Rep. Hill strongly opposed these actions. He stated, “Legal businesses in this country must have access to banking and financial services, ” stressing that the government should not prevent businesses from operating freely within the financial system. Equal banking access for crypto firms Hill’s comments indicate that, under his leadership, the committee will take a strong stance on ensuring crypto businesses have equal access to banking services. Testimonies from crypto industry leaders, such as Denelle Dixon, CEO of Stellar Development Foundation, and Nathan McCauley, CEO of Anchorage Digital, revealed how their companies had struggled to maintain banking relationships. Dixon also explained that her company had been forced to approach ten different banks after facing rejections, with no explanation provided for the denials. This was accepted by other crypto executives who have experienced similar difficulties. Rep. Hill’s comments come at an important moment. He is to lead the committee in 2025, following Patrick McHenry’s retirement. The committee’s leadership change could give a shift in how Congress approaches crypto regulation and banking access. Hill, along with other pro-crypto Republicans such as Andy Barr, Bill Huizenga, and Frank Lucas, may play a pivotal role in shaping the future of crypto legislation. The issues around debanking are part of larger talks about regulating crypto, including stablecoins. Hill is hopeful that despite challenges, progress on crypto laws, including a stablecoin bill, will happen before the end of 2024. Rep. Maxine Waters, the leading Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, also backed progress on crypto laws. She recognized the challenges but noted that bipartisan work on stablecoin regulation was advancing. Waters said, “I’ve always appreciated Mr. McHenry’s efforts to find common ground. Hopefully, we can see meaningful progress before the new Congress begins.” As the crypto industry faces increasing scrutiny and regulatory challenges, Rep. Hill’s leadership could prove crucial in ensuring the sector’s continued access to banking services.

Two voted against it, and three were absent. Vancouver to Explore Bitcoin Integration The mayor’s initiative aims to explore Bitcoin as a potential safeguard against inflation and currency devaluation. In a statement , Sim, who is an investor in cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, said that the city must adapt to global financial shifts, especially given its growing affordability crisis. The city’s housing market saw a staggering 381% increase in value between 1995 and 2022, while traditional assets like gold and city securities failed to provide comparable returns. In contrast, Bitcoin has offered substantial returns over the past decade, and Sim believes it could play a crucial role in stabilizing the city’s finances amid inflation and the devaluation of traditional currency. In an interview with the Canadian news outlet Global News right before the vote, Sim was quoted saying. “Bitcoin is the number one performing asset on the planet over the last 16 years, so to not even look at including it as a part of a diversified portfolio is, I think, reckless.” Sim’s motion calls for a report by the end of the first quarter of 2025 to assess the feasibility, risks, and benefits of Bitcoin adoption. Despite the support, the proposal faced opposition from Councilor Pete Fry, who raised concerns about Bitcoin’s potential for misuse in criminal activities and its environmental impact due to high energy consumption from mining. To demonstrate his commitment, Sim has pledged a $10,000 donation in Bitcoin to the city, regardless of the outcome. He had said, “Our family is going to donate $10,000 to the City of Vancouver in the form of bitcoin and this is going to be a gift to the city that we love. We totally believe in the benefits of this and we’re putting our money where our mouth is.” Hurdles Ahead Although the motion has passed, challenges remain, particularly with legal restrictions that prevent municipalities from holding cryptocurrency as reserves. The provincial government has also clarified that local authorities are not authorized to use Bitcoin for transactions or investments under current law. Following the development, the Ministry of Housing and Municipal Affairs highlighted that existing provincial laws, including the Community Charter and Vancouver Charter, prohibit the use of cryptocurrencies for municipal payments or transactions. Local governments are also restricted from holding cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in reserves, as legislation dictates that public funds can only be invested in low-risk, approved options to ensure financial stability.

Running on Ethereum allows SHIB to work with decentralized applications like ShibaSwap, its own decentralized exchange. Plans include a future NFT platform and a governance system based on a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). This gives SHIB potential utility beyond being a meme coin, which may make it attractive in the current market cycle. Conclusion Shiba Inu and similar coins show less potential in the short term.

Plus, the price projections for 2025 show a steady rise, making now the perfect time to get involved. So, imagine your $4,000 investment at today’s price of $0.00012 per coin—if BTFD hits its projected value of $0.00060 by 2025, that initial investment could grow to a whopping $18,000. With its deflationary tokenomics, community-first approach, and a roadmap that screams potential, BTFD Coin is what everyone’s looking forward to. Mog Coin: The Meme Coin That’s No Joke If BTFD Coin is the cool kid at the party, Mog Coin is the quietly ambitious one who’s too busy building an empire to care about the noise. This gem is making its way through the meme coin ranks, and unlike some of its peers, Mog Coin’s appeal isn’t just about memes and Twitter buzz—it’s got substance. Mog Coin (yes, it’s as quirky as it sounds) focuses on fostering a deflationary tokenomics system. In other words, it doesn’t just let its holders sit there twiddling their thumbs; every transaction reduces the supply of Mog, increasing scarcity and, potentially, value. It’s like having a limited edition item in your collection. The fact that it is based on Ethereum and has cross-chain compatibility means that Mog has some serious staying power. As of now, Mog Coin trades at around $0.0000003277. Granted, it’s been struggling lately, but analysts are optimistic about the future. While its immediate price target isn’t going to make you a millionaire overnight, the long-term promise here is where the magic lies. 2025 and 2026 projections show it could reach $ 0.00001 or more, delivering those much-coveted exponential returns. So, if you’re on the lookout for a meme coin with a bit more of a “behind-the-scenes” vibe (but still packing a punch), Mog Coin is worth keeping your eyes on. Ponke Coin: A Memeworthy Hidden Gem When you think of meme coins, you might picture a few light-hearted tweets and maybe a dog or two, but Ponke Coin is here to prove that meme coins can be downright hilarious and highly profitable at the same time. Don’t let the playful name fool you; Ponke has quickly become a serious contender in the meme coin game. Why, you ask? Well, Ponke Coin is one of the few meme coins that’s taken its community-first approach to the next level. It’s community-run, and that means holders are essentially in control of its future. The team is looking to introduce decentralised finance (DeFi) features, like staking and yield farming, which could add some serious utility to this meme-fuelled ride. It’s one thing to have memes, but when you add financial incentives into the mix, you’re cooking with gas. Ponke’s current price is $0.525278, which might seem modest, but that’s the beauty of it. According to industry predictions, Ponke Coin could see a 229.17% increase by January, and even more as 2025 rolls in. The key here is the long game: for those willing to wait and watch the community grow, Ponke is poised for a major price surge. Final Thoughts: Ready to Jump on the BTFD Coin Bull Run? The BTFD Coin presale is heating up, and if you’re not already on board, you’re missing out. This is your chance to get in early and ride the wave before it slows down. So, what are you waiting for? Grab your investment and get ready for some serious growth. The Bulls are charging ahead, and you won’t want to miss this one.

Many of the ETPs available on Spotlight are managed by third-party operators. The company has been at the forefront of innovation, launching the first Dogecoin (DOGE) ETP in November. This product began trading on Sweden’s Spotlight Stock Market, allowing both retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to Dogecoin in a regulated fund wrapper. Spotlight is one of Sweden’s three stock exchanges, alongside Nasdaq Nordic and Nordic Growth Market. In October, Valour moved 19 of its ETPs from the Nordic Growth Market to Spotlight, consolidating its offerings onto a single platform. Valour’s product range also includes a physically backed Ethereum staking ETP, introduced on the London Stock Exchange in September. This ETP provides institutional investors with passive, non-leveraged exposure to Ethereum (ETH) while earning staking rewards. Valour is now expanding its crypto ETP offerings to African markets, having partnered with the Nairobi Securities Exchange. This initiative, supported by SovFi, includes ETPs for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Hedera. Valour is also committed to offering secure, regulated digital asset investment options globally and is expanding its presence in Asia. In November, Valour signed a memorandum of understanding with AsiaNext, a Singapore-licensed securities exchange, to list ETPs. AsiaNext is a joint venture between Japan’s SBI Digital Asset Holdings and Switzerland’s SIX Group, which has further strengthened Valour’s global footprint in the crypto ETP market.

37560490,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626770,1734041447,Nvidia faces legal action from shareholders over crypto revenue,"The U.S. Supreme Court allowed a lawsuit against Nvidia over underreporting $1.35 billion in crypto revenue, leading to $3.8 billion in losses. Supported by the DOJ and SEC, the case could set a precedent for transparency in crypto mining. Despite legal challenges, Nvidia’s revenue surged 190% in 2023. On December 11, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Nvidia’s appeal in a class-action lawsuit and allowed it to move forward in lower courts. Supreme court decision The case, which was first filed in 2018, accuses Nvidia of misleading investors about the company’s reliance on cryptocurrency mining sales during a volatile period in the market. Investors claim that Nvidia failed to disclose the true extent of its crypto-related revenue, which led to substantial financial losses when the cryptocurrency market crashed in late 2018. The case centers on the allegations that Nvidia understated its crypto-related revenue by $1.35 billion, resulting in approximately $3.8 billion in losses for investors, as its stock price dropped by 30% when crypto-driven GPU sales collapsed. Nvidia’s dependence on the cryptocurrency mining boom, particularly in 2017-2018, is now being closely examined in the ongoing legal case. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals revived the case after it was initially dismissed in 2021. Nvidia had argued that the Lawsuit lacked to proceed the evidence. However, the Supreme Court’s ruling to dismiss Nvidia’s appeal means the case will be trialed in a federal district court in Oakland, California. Legal experts believe this decision could influence how companies report their earnings from new industries, like cryptocurrency mining, and emphasize the need for clearer financial transparency. The Lawsuit has gained backing from the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which have supported the shareholders’ claims. This aligns with Nvidia’s ongoing legal challenges, which also include an ongoing antitrust investigation in China. If the Lawsuit succeeds, it could have a big impact on how companies share their financial information, especially in industries affected by the unpredictable cryptocurrency market. Nvidia’s financial Despite the legal hurdles, Nvidia has demonstrated remarkable financial resilience. In 2023, the company’s revenue surged nearly 190%, with total Q3 revenue reaching $35.1 billion—a 95% increase compared to the previous year. The company’s Data Center segment saw 111% year-over-year growth, while Nvidia’s stock has benefited from the GPUs in gaming and artificial intelligence apps.

42389721,72d79e90-bd49-4c00-ac03-d44046dbc6cd,1734041340,Solana Was the Biggest Draw for New Crypto Developers in 2024: Electric Capital,"The ranks of cryptocurrency developers held steady in 2024, as some recent entrants left the industry while veterans mostly stuck around, according to a report released Thursday by Electric Capital.    The total developers working in crypto worldwide was basically flat, declining a statistically insignificant 7% from a year earlier, and the number of monthly active developers went to 23,613 in November, the report said.    Meanwhile, the Solana ecosystem, ground zero for the memecoin craze, was the most popular blockchain among new developers, an 83% increase in its ecosystem compared to a year earlier. In July, this community became the first since 2016 to bring on board more devs than Ethereum. Solana attracted 7,625 new developers in 2024, the most of any chain and a little over 1,000 more than Ethereum.    The results underscore the challenge Ethereum faces as rival smart contract platform Solana's low fees and fast transactions attract investment and talent.   According to Maria Shen, a general partner at Electric Capital, the share of developers who have worked in crypto for more than two years grew in 2024. Among those who left the industry, the largest group were relative newcomers.    “These are people who effectively joined during the bear market, and haven’t really seen anything since then,” Shen told CoinDesk in an interview.    The stability of the developer population is an auspicious sign, Shen said.    “When we look at the sector of established developers, it's growing and looking very healthy,"" she said. ""When we look at full-time developers .. this had the least amount of declines, very small, like [a] 4% decline year over year. So overall, I would say, [the population is] looking very healthy, but it's flat, and mainly because of the losses from people who joined less than a year ago and then less than two years ago.”  Solana has momentum, Ethereum remains dominant  Despite Solana’s momentum and massive increase in new developer talent, its main competitor, Ethereum, is still ahead.    “Ethereum absolutely dominates,” said Shen “Ethereum has very, very deep network effects, and you can see that through the data.”    The number of monthly Ethereum developers shrank by 17% over the last year, to 6,244, but Shen said this blockchain still has the biggest developer ecosystem by far.    “Ethereum dominates by overall developers everywhere, in every continent of the world. But Solana is currently number two,” Shen said.    Growth in Ethereum development can mainly be attributed to the vast number of layer-2 networks that have popped up, with Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum seeing many developers working on their chains. Slightly more than half – 56% – of Ethereum developers are working on the layer-2s on top of it, Electric Capital found.    Furthermore, Eigenlayer, the main restaking protocol on Ethereum, brought in a period of massive developer innovation for its ecosystem as protocols deployed their Actively Validated Services (AVS) in the ecosystem. Eigenlayer was the fastest growing developer ecosystem in 2024, with a 167% increase by monthly overall developers, the report said.  Developers are global  Electric Capital’s report also showed that crypto is becoming more global, as Asia became the continent with the biggest number of blockchain developers, and North America dropped from first place to third. However, the U.S. remains the number one country for now for developers, with a 19% share.    India, however, brought on board more new crypto developers in 2024 than any other country, with 17% of the new developer share.    “Anecdotally, there's a lot of education programs and developer education programs, there's a lot of hackathons in India,” Shen said.    The geographic diversification of developers is another salubrious trend, Shen said.    “The idea that the U.S. and North America continues its dominance is not only unlikely, but I would say, kind of undesirable,"" she said. ""You do want to see more global diversity in crypto, and to be borderless, and I think there's a lot of great engineering talent outside of the U.S.""    Read more: Crypto Developers Grew in Numbers Amid Bear Market, VC Firm Electric Capital Says",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/12/12/solana-was-the-biggest-draw-for-new-crypto-developers-in-2024-electric-capital,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3561f4c4f23aa4aad2544e069862bfbe99a762a9-5184x3888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417012,f9bc6fae-66da-4619-9249-4e95ba8cf9e2,1734041186,Haliey Welch’s $HAWK Shows Why We Need Better Standards for Memecoins,"Haliey Welch, widely recognized as “Hawk Tuah,” transformed her fleeting viral fame into a formidable media empire. With a burgeoning social media presence (230K followers on Instagram), lucrative brand partnerships, and the successful podcast Talk Tuah, Welch appeared to be transitioning from internet personality to business mogul.  That was until the 22-year-old launched her memecoin, $HAWK. Now Hawk Tuah isn’t flying so high.  $HAWK was launched on the Solana blockchain with considerable fanfare, initially skyrocketing to a $491 million market cap. This meteoric rise was short-lived, as the coin's valuation plummeted to under $20 million, according to data from DEX Screener.  The rapid decline raises questions about the project's legitimacy and the motives behind its management. A now-deleted Twitter Spaces discussion further intensified suspicions, leading to widespread allegations that $HAWK is nothing more than a “celebrity rugpull.”  To understand what happened, it is first necessary to examine the structure and decision-making processes that seemed to have underpinned the $HAWK launch.  Launching a memecoin might seem like a walk in the park (anyone can do it on Pump.fun). But doing it successfully is much harder. It requires capital, marketing and technical expertise alongside something good in the first place. You need teamwork. I say this as a founder who’s been in Web3 since 2013, has raised tens of millions of dollars in venture capital for projects of my own, and is a venture capitalist at a large venture fund, Foresight Ventures. (For more on how to launch a memecoin, see my other recent CoinDesk article here). $HAWK seems to have had three distinct teams behind it, according to internet sleuth Coffeezilla:  Welch’s Web2 team, responsible for her “traditional” brand  Memetic Labs, led by founder Doc Hollywood, managing blockchain-related activities and holding the pen on all Web3 related decisions  and overHere, a new technical service provider specifically brought in to facilitate a novel token claim process designed to onboard Welch’s Web2 audience.  OverHere initially engaged in discussions with me to provide context about its role and said it was open to providing anything more in a transparent manner.  In a since deleted X Spaces, Welch abruptly dropped off around 1:00am EST, telling listeners she was going to sleep. Doc Hollywood dominated the conversation. His company Memetics Labs was responsible for critical aspects of the token release, such as tokenomics, token minting and distribution, marketing (e.g. messaging over primary mediums such as X), liquidity pool creation, and trading fee settings.  One listener asked why the trading fees on Meteora were so high (Meteora is a decentralized exchange, or DEX, where users can trade cryptocurrencies directly, without middlemen.) Doc Hollywood said many of the expenses were related to costs associated with overHere’s team, as well as costs associated with setting up the foundation in the Cayman Islands. A claim partly refuted by overHere, who maintains it built the tech pro bono.  According to various industry sources who were made aware of the product’s only recent development, the social token utility technology overHere built had a new conceptual-business model. It’s one that would tokenize likeness and intellectual property tied to Web2 fans. And it’s not something that has existed in prior memecoin launches, let alone any crypto project.  Welch’s team, likely on the advice of Web3 adviser Memetic Labs, implemented exorbitant pool fees of 15% on Meteora, a decision that drew criticism from overHere when I first contacted on December 4. It seemed to maximize short term profits at the expense of the trust of both Welch’s existing Web2 community, as well as the Web3 community she hoped to expand into with this launch. High trading fees undermine the project's credibility.  Another point of contention: the sale of millions of tokens post-launch by pre-sale investors, who were granted unrestricted access to vest their tokens. This effectively diluted the token’s value and raised suspicions of insider manipulation.  OverHere maintained its involvement was devoid of financial incentives, claiming no profits from Meteora or the pre-sale, and no access to free tokens. It described its focus as establishing $HAWK as a pioneering case study for leveraging intellectual property in token launches. However, the project's trajectory, shaped by decisions from Welch’s Web3 team, was marred by mismanagement and missteps that made that impossible.  A lack of transparency emerges as the most significant failing in the $HAWK saga. The absence of a publicly disclosed tokenomics and distribution plan prior to the launch gave rise to accusations that the team was insider-dealing. Critics used BubbleMaps, an auditing tool for DeFI and NFTs, to claim that 96% of the tokens were allegedly allocated to the “team.” overHere later said the actual distribution for “the team” was 10%, which includes allocations for the community fund, reserves, and strategic purposes.  According to overHere’s understanding, the Web3 team — which maintained sole deployer wallet access — has denied selling these tokens. In reality, it appears this selling pressure originated from certain pre-sale investors whose involvement was never publicly disclosed prior to the launch. The initial confusion underscores a failure in communication and transparency from the outset.  Another issue was lock and vesting mechanisms were not immediately implemented, but this delay stemmed from technical bugs within the vesting protocol. All discussions regarding the token’s lock and vesting schedules were managed by Welch's Web3 team in collaboration with Magna, the service provider overseeing these mechanisms. OverHere was intentionally uninvolved in these decisions, emphasizing its role as a technical service provider rather than an operational team. It has expressed a willingness to provide extensive documentation to clarify its position and responsibilities.  Industry experts such as Ellipsis’ Jarry Xiao have said they didn’t think Welch's team(s) had “malicious intent (this was clearly not their desired outcome). But without evidence to the contrary, this appears to be a blatant cash grab without any consideration of the consequences to retail.”  The story is a stark reminder of the perils inherent in merging celebrity influence with the nascent and often unregulated cryptocurrency market. The promise of decentralized finance funding media empires without traditional equity sales is alluring, yet $HAWK exposes the fragile foundation upon which such ventures are built. The lack of transparency, accountability, and ethical oversight can swiftly transform a promising project into a cautionary tale.  $HAWK is a testament to the critical need for robust governance frameworks and unwavering transparency in Web3 initiatives. As the team endeavors to rebuild trust and redefine $HAWK’s purpose, we, the crypto industry, must heed this lesson: without clear accountability and open communication, even the most promising projects are susceptible to collapse. We need to embed transparency and accountability at the core of all Web3 projects, particularly those of high-profile personalities who can just as easily become victims of exploitation.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Azeem Khan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/12/haliey-welch-s-hawk-shows-why-we-need-better-standards-for-memecoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7fc267b56aca422879c568e2f704fa9b1c568a50-507x561.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Pepe Loves Santa (PEPESAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Loves Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Loves Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Loves Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Loves Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Loves Santa by entering its contract address – 9FuN9o4pQgF3NF1v2saWvb7b9hNKDJ1DGU6LSbur437Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

Despite this pullback, SOL’s price structure remains strong, with the token holding firmly above a critical demand zone. This consolidation phase indicates the market is gearing up for another potential breakout as bullish sentiment persists. Related Reading: Bitcoin Finds Support At $94.5K As STH Realized Prize Signals Strength Renowned crypto analyst and investor Jelle recently shared a technical analysis on X, expressing optimism about Solana’s future price trajectory. According to Jelle, the retrace is a healthy correction that allows SOL to build the strength needed for another significant rally. He predicts that Solana will reach new all-time highs before Christmas, setting the stage for an exciting close to the year. With Solana maintaining its position above key levels and investor interest remaining robust, all eyes are on the $264 mark as bulls prepare to push the token into price discovery once again. The coming weeks will be pivotal, with the potential for SOL to reclaim its momentum and deliver significant gains. If the bullish predictions hold true, Solana could solidify its position as one of the standout performers in the crypto market this cycle. Solana Price Action Signals Strength Solana (SOL) continues to show bullish momentum, holding strong above $210, a critical support level that previously acted as resistance. This price behavior signals a healthy retrace, allowing the market to reset before another potential move higher. Solana’s ability to maintain this level reinforces the bullish narrative, suggesting that it’s preparing for another upward push. Top crypto analyst Jelle recently shared his insights on X, expressing confidence in Solana’s price trajectory. Jelle’s technical analysis predicts that SOL will reach new heights before Christmas, highlighting a price target of $300 in the near term. He emphasizes that the current consolidation phase is a positive sign, as it allows for accumulation and builds the momentum necessary for a breakout. However, despite the optimism, the possibility of a prolonged consolidation phase looms if SOL fails to break its all-time high (ATH). This scenario could lead to a temporary stagnation in price action, with SOL ranging sideways as traders await a clearer market direction. Such a consolidation phase would not necessarily be bearish but could delay the anticipated rally. Related Reading: Cardano Follows 2020 Bullish Pattern – Top Analyst Plans To Take Profits Between $4 And $6 For Solana to meet Jelle’s $300 target, bulls must reclaim and hold levels above the ATH, signaling strength and renewed buyer interest. If successful, Solana is poised to enter price discovery once again, securing its position as a top-performing crypto asset in the current market cycle. SOL Testing Liquidity Levels Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $232, showing resilience after successfully holding key demand levels at $210. This critical support has proven vital in maintaining bullish momentum, allowing the price to recover and consolidate above $222. The ability to stay above this mark has strengthened investor confidence, with the focus now shifting to higher targets. The next key resistance for SOL is $246. Breaking above this level would not only signify a bullish breakout but also position SOL to challenge and surpass its all-time high (ATH) of $264. A confirmed breakout above $246 would signal renewed momentum, potentially driving Solana into uncharted territory and reigniting market excitement.

If the price struggles to break above the $246 level in the coming weeks, it risks losing momentum.

No. 1598 for Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,"Texas State Representative Giovanni Capriglione has introduced a bill, H.B. No. 1598, to the Texas House of Representatives to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the state. The proposed legislation aims to build up a supply of Bitcoin, which would be held for at least five years without being sold, and would allow Texas citizens to make donations to the fund. The initiative is part of Texas's broader commitment to fostering innovation in digital assets and enhancing the state's fiscal stability. The bill's introduction comes amidst national discussions on creating a similar reserve at the federal level, with Texas aiming to lead in Bitcoin innovation. Known for its high concentration of Bitcoin miners, the state could potentially see miners paying taxes in Bitcoin, although the initial proposal does not include a direct Bitcoin purchasing strategy.

37560752,https://blockworks.co/news/solana-gaming-startup-open-sources-validator,1734040800,MagicBlock open sources a16z-backed ‘ephemeral rollup’ tech,"This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . The Solana gaming infrastructure startup MagicBlock is making its ephemeral validator — which creates momentary Solana rollups that can process transactions quicker — open source, the team told Lightspeed exclusively. When MagicBlock went through a16z’s crypto startup accelerator and began advertising its tech earlier this year, it conceived of itself as infrastructure for building onchain games. But when I spoke with MagicBlock co-founder and CEO Andrea Fortugno recently, he pitched me on a broader vision — that MagicBlock’s ephemeral rollups could let all developers move away from traditional web servers and make apps “unstoppable.” To be clear, games are still being built with MagicBlock’s architecture. Supersize, which won the Solana-centric Radar hackathon’s gaming track last month, is built on MagicBlock. So is Windfall, Radar’s third-place gaming project. For both games, MagicBlock offers a way to run onchain without sacrificing speed. MagicBlock does this by running a non-voting Solana validator that runs in parallel with Solana and can momentarily make computing resources “elastic” before a security committee verifies the state and settles it to the layer-1. In other words, Solana’s data is temporarily moved to a rollup (like Optimism on Ethereum) for some time- or resource-sensitive functions that would ordinarily be performed offchain on centralized servers. This newly open-source tech is initially under a license that will prevent other projects from launching commercial products with the ephemeral validator unless they strike a deal with MagicBlock, Fortugno said. MagicBlock currently charges a protocol-level fee as well. Despite the new gaming clients, the pivot to other crypto sectors is also clear in MagicBlock’s messaging. I asked Fortugno if this was because crypto gaming outside of a few rare standouts like Off the Grid has so far failed to live up to the hype. Fortugno disagreed with the assessment that crypto gaming is struggling, and he said other use cases could make use of ephemeral rollups with “zero effort.” “The tech is already there, and so it would be stupid not to try to tackle the other use cases,” Fortugno said. He also said SocialFi apps and perpetual futures DEXs are looking at building on MagicBlock. DeFi makes sense as a use case here: Solana-based perps DEX Zeta Markets is building a Solana layer-2 of its own to compete with centralized exchange speeds. Fortugno used the term “unstoppable” frequently in our interview, which is really what’s cool about ephemeral rollups. Many Solana apps have parts run by centralized entities partly because doing everything on a blockchain is not financially viable. If MagicBlock lives up to its billing, it could make these apps a lot more trustless. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

The positive price action came as President-elect Donald Trump said ""we're going to do something great with crypto"" while ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, reiterating his ambition to embrace digital assets in the U.S. and create a strategic bitcoin reserve. Alongside, the European Central Bank trimmed its benchmark interest rates by 25 basis points and in its dovish policy statement hinted that more rate cuts were likely to happen.  Bitcoin rose as high as $102,500, its strongest price since last week's all-time record above $104,000. Not only did that rally not hold, but the $100,000 level didn't either, with the price falling to $99,800 by press time late Thursday afternoon.  Major risk assets as a group sold off as well, perhaps as Western bond markets reacted negatively to the ECB dovishness. The German 10-year Bund yield rose 8 basis points to 2.21% and the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield gained 6.5 basis points to 4.34%. U.S. stocks gave up early gains to close lower, the Nasdaq dropping 0.7% and S&P 500 0.5%. The price of gold also fell during the afternoon, shedding 1.8% to $2,706 per ounce.  Altcoins on average outperformed BTC with most members of the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index booking daily gains. Native tokens of Avalanche network (AVAX) and data provider Chainlink (LINK) were the best-performing assets in the basket, advancing 9% and 13%. AVAX was perhaps benefiting from news of a $250 million token investment led by Galaxy, Dragonfly and ParaFi Capital, while Trump-affiliated decentralized finance project World Liberty Financial (WLFI) continued to purchase LINK through the day, adding $1 million more tokens in the later hours, onchain data by Arkham Intelligence showed.  The second-largest cryptocurrency ether (ETH) also outperformed BTC, holding onto a 1.5% daily gain after retracing from its session high just shy of $4,000.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Whale-backed DOGEN eyes 46,700% gains, set to outshine PEPE and BONK. Table of Contents DOGEN: The alpha meme token taking over PEPE: Capturing the spirit of Pepe the Frog BONK: Rising meme coin with community focus Conclusion Cryptocurrency followers are talking about a new digital coin that might overtake popular tokens such as PEPE and BONK. Supported by large investors, this new crypto has analysts predicting incredible growth of up to 46,700%. DOGEN: The alpha meme token taking over DOGEN is a new, bold, and bullish meme token looking to dominate the crypto market. Built for holders with unshakable confidence, DOGEN is all about power, resilience, and unstoppable momentum. DOGEN is ready to surge, with a 700% value appreciation anticipated in the coming months. As a Solana-powered beast, it has the potential to deliver the thousand-fold gains that define this altcoin season. DOGEN rewards its loyal community with an exclusive airdrop. To join the action, investors need to flex DOGEN pride on social media, grab tokens during the presale, and start building their DOGEN army. Each recruit nets 20% of the golden points from token purchases. That’s not all — DOGEN’s multi-tier referral program lets investors earn 7% from direct referrals’ token buys (1st level), with additional rewards as they unlock more levels. The more their DOGEN network grows, the bigger their earnings. With altseason on the horizon, DOGEN holders are poised to dominate the market. Exclusive campaigns, luxury perks, and game-changing opportunities await those who refuse to settle for less. DOGEN is for winners who want it all — posh cars, fat stacks of cash, and a life of luxury. Interested investors can join the DOGEN army through its presale. You might also like: These top altcoins could deliver 5,000% gains by Christmas PEPE: Capturing the spirit of Pepe the Frog PEPE is a deflationary meme coin launched on the Ethereum network, inspired by the Pepe the Frog meme. It aims to follow the success of meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. PEPE has no transaction tax and prides itself on being a pure meme coin without utility. The coin reached a peak market cap of $1.6 billion in mid-2023. Its roadmap includes phases to increase visibility through social media trends and exchange listings, a burning mechanism to enhance scarcity, and a redistribution system to reward long-term holders. As an ERC-20 token, PEPE benefits from Ethereum’s security. It is available on platforms like Uniswap, Binance, and KuCoin. In the current market cycle, PEPE’s simplicity and community support may attract investors. BONK: Rising meme coin with community focus BONK is a Solana-based meme coin featuring a Shiba Inu mascot. It aims to empower the Solana community by redistributing power from venture capital tokens. After a Coinbase listing, BONK surged over 100%. As a “community coin,” it airdropped 50% of its supply to participants in Solana’s NFT and DeFi ecosystems. By mid-December 2023, BONK became the third-largest meme coin by market cap, gaining over 10,000% year-to-date. BONK’s integration into Solana’s ecosystem, including the launch of BonkSwap, a decentralized exchange, shows its potential. Despite challenges like a high total supply and volatility, BONK’s growth and involvement in a growing ecosystem make it an attractive option in the current market cycle. Conclusion In this bull run, PEPE and BONK may have less short-term potential. DOGEN, designed for those seeking luxury and success, expects 700% growth by presale’s end, with potential thousand-fold returns. Following tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN builds a community of leaders aiming to dominate the market and offer real benefits and exclusive perks to early adopters.

37559874,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626750,1734040209,Judge tells FDIC to rethink redactions on Coinbase ‘Pause Letters’,"A federal judge has ordered the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to fix its redaction mess in letters sent to banks over crypto services. Judge Reyes said the FDIC showed a “lack of good-faith effort” in complying with a court mandate. According to him, the agency blanketed nearly everything with black ink, leaving out only the basics like “articles or prepositions.” The letters, uncovered through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request tied to Coinbase, expose what many in the community have long suspected: federal regulators tried to block traditional banks from engaging with crypto firms. One letter from 2022 revealed the FDIC asking a bank to “pause all crypto asset-related activity” until further notice, promising to clarify its expectations at an unspecified later date. Coinbase fights back against regulatory pressure Coinbase, through a lawsuit filed in June, compelled the FDIC to release 23 of these heavily redacted letters. The revelations have added fuel to the fire for Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal, who has been outspoken about what he sees as an attack on the crypto industry. “The FDIC undertook a very concerted effort to deny regulated institutions, primarily banks, the right to offer legal services to the crypto community,” he said. “If it’s crypto today, it could be any other business tomorrow.” This alleged campaign, often referred to as “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” echoes an earlier regulatory crackdown under the Obama administration. The original Operation Choke Point targeted industries like payday lending and firearms by pressuring banks to sever ties with them. The updated version, according to crypto insiders, is directed squarely at them. The letters show the FDIC wasn’t working in isolation. “One thing you can tell from the letters is that this wasn’t just one rogue bank supervisor going off half-cocked,” Grewal explained. “These were multiple regional offices from all across the country, all executing the same playbook.” That playbook reportedly involved discouraging banks from offering crypto services and, if the banks didn’t comply, bombarding them with audit requests and compliance demands. “If you’re a regulated bank just trying to do your job, you’re basically told that offering crypto services will bring down the full weight of the federal government,” Grewal said. “You’re going to respond to that negative incentive.” Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long, a frequent critic of the Federal Reserve and FDIC, backed these claims. Long pointed out that many of the FDIC’s letters were also copied to the Federal Reserve, suggesting coordination between regulators. She labeled the letters “functionally cease-and-desist orders” and likened the so-called “pause” to Nixon’s infamous 1971 suspension of gold convertibility. “A three-year delay isn’t a mere ‘pause,’” she said. Political changes could change the game for crypto The timing of these revelations comes as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office, bringing a more crypto-friendly administration to Washington. Trump has already named crypto advocate Paul Atkins to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), replacing outgoing Chair Gary Gensler. Gensler, infamous in crypto circles for calling the industry a breeding ground for “hucksters and frauds,” will step down on January 20. Trump has also tapped David Sacks, a well-known investor and entrepreneur, as his “White House AI and Crypto Czar.” Grewal expressed cautious optimism about the incoming administration’s approach. “We’re seeing nominees with a more balanced view of crypto. Nobody is in favor of unregulated crypto—certainly, Coinbase isn’t—but protecting consumers must be balanced against promoting American innovation.” Meanwhile, Grewal plans to push for a court order that forces the FDIC to lift its redactions completely. The unredacted letters could reveal the names of banks and services that regulators targeted, bringing more transparency to what Coinbase and others describe as a coordinated campaign to stifle crypto. FDIC, along with the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, has consistently denied discouraging banks from providing services to crypto companies. In joint guidance issued in 2023, the agencies said that “banking organizations are neither prohibited nor discouraged from providing banking services to customers of any specific class or type, as permitted by law or regulation.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/judge-tells-fdic-to-rethink-redactions-on-coinbase-pause-letters/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37559874.jpeg

37560977,https://thecoinrise.com/hut-8-stock-soars-amid-meta-partnership-speculation/,1734039957,Hut 8 Stock Soars Amid Meta Partnership Speculation,"Hut 8, a prominent Bitcoin mining company , has recently seen its shares soar to nearly 12% in early market trading. As of this morning, Hut 8’s stock was trading close to $30, sparking interest from investors. This surge was speculatively driven by online rumors suggesting Hut 8 is partnering with Meta Platform, the tech giant behind Facebook. The CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF, which tracks the entire bitcoin mining industry, also saw a boost, climbing 3%. Yet, despite the buzz, Hut 8 and Meta have kept quiet, leaving investors to wonder if the rumors hold any weight. A Billion-Dollar Data Center in Louisiana The surge in Hut 8’s stock comes as the company is reportedly working on building a data center in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana. This project is estimated to have an initial cost of $12 billion. This comes after the company expanded its mining operations with a 63-megawatt mining facility in Culberson County, Texas, earlier this year. The data center is expected to play a key role in Hut 8’s plans, particularly as it adapts to the evolving tech landscape. Interestingly, Meta recently revealed plans to build a whopping $10 billion AI data center in nearby Richland Parish, Louisiana. Similarities Between Bitcoin Mining and AI Data Centers While Bitcoin mining and AI data centers might seem worlds apart, they have much in common. Both require massive computing power, sophisticated hardware, and vast energy. Recently, some Bitcoin miners have started integrating AI technology into their operations, diversifying their revenue streams beyond crypto assets. This comes as the demand for artificial intelligence grows. This shift makes the idea of Hut 8 expanding into AI more plausible, fueling speculation that it could team up with Meta. Hut 8’s Financial Moves and Current Standing Hut 8 is no stranger to financial maneuvers. Earlier this year, the company announced a $500 million at-the-market (ATM) offering and a $250 million stock repurchase program. These financial moves are part of its strategy to bolster its financial standing. In November, the company mined 94 BTC, a slight 6% drop from the previous month. The company’s total Bitcoin holdings now stand at 9,122 BTC, valued at around $921 million. This makes Hut 8 the seventh-largest publicly traded holder of Bitcoin. Hut 8 recently acquired 31,145 Bitmain Antminer S21+ machines , expected to boost its self-mining hashrate by 66% by Q1 2025. This move is geared to enhance its operational capacity and drive profitability. While neither Hut 8 nor Meta has confirmed any partnership, the speculation is proving to be a powerful driver of stock movement.

You might also like: DOGE targets $2 but XYZVerse shines with $3 and 30,000x growth in sight XRP XRP (XRP) has seen significant volatility in recent times. Over the past week, its price dropped by 25.46%, landing within the current range of $2.22 to $2.95. Despite this short-term decline, the cryptocurrency has experienced impressive growth over the longer term, with a 263.24% increase in the past month and a 313.35% rise over the last six months. Technical indicators present a mixed outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 37.29, suggesting that XRP is approaching oversold territory. The Stochastic oscillator sits at 24.11, which may indicate potential for a price correction. The Simple Moving Average over 10 days is $2.13, compared to the 100-day SMA of $2.41, hinting at recent bearish momentum. Key levels to watch are the nearest support at $1.83 and resistance at $3.30. If the price moves below the support, the next level is $1.09. On the upside, breaking past the resistance could lead to testing the second resistance level at $4.03. These levels represent significant percentage changes from the current price range, and traders are monitoring them closely. Cardano Cardano (ADA) has seen significant price movement recently. In the past week, its price fell by 21.03%, landing between $1.06 and $1.33. Despite this drop, ADA’s price surged by 91.15% over the last month. Over six months, it has risen by 116.89%, highlighting strong long-term growth. Technical indicators are mixed for ADA. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 38.3, suggesting approaching oversold conditions. The Stochastic is near 23.0, also pointing to potential overselling. The MACD level is negative at -0.0358, indicating bearish momentum. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.98, below the 100-day average of $1.14, which can be a bearish signal. ADA faces resistance at $1.46. Breaking above this could lead to the next target at $1.73, offering potential gains of about 10% and 30%. The nearest support is at $0.92; dropping to this level would mean a decrease of roughly 13%. A further drop to the second support at $0.65 would imply more significant losses. Given the oversold indicators, there may be room for a rebound, but bearish signals suggest caution. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced notable price fluctuations recently. In the past week, its price decreased by 15.80%. Despite this short-term drop, the token saw a 22.75% increase over the past month and a 13.46% rise in the last six months. Currently, SHIB is trading between $0.00002805 and $0.00003489. The coin’s nearest resistance level is at $0.00003759. Breaking this could lead SHIB towards the second resistance at $0.00004442. On the support side, the nearest level is $0.00002390, with a secondary support at $0.00001706. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.00002613, which is below the current price, indicating a recent upward trend. The 100-day Simple Moving Average stands at $0.00003024. Technical indicators suggest potential movement. The Relative Strength Index is at 37.11, hinting that SHIB is approaching oversold territory. The Stochastic indicator reads 21.90, also suggesting possible upward momentum. The MACD level is slightly negative at -9.962e-7, reflecting mild bearish sentiment. Considering these factors, SHIB’s price may test its resistance levels soon if buying pressure increases. Conclusion XRP, ADA, and SHIB are rising strongly, echoing past bull run patterns. But XYZVerse aims to surpass them by uniting sports fans in a unique meme coin with big growth plans.

With a robust 45% increase over the past month and 32% over six months, AVAX is building momentum. The current price is hovering between $47 and $58, approaching the resistance level at $62. A break above this could see the price target $73, offering significant upside. The RSI sits at 35, suggesting AVAX is nearing oversold territory, which may trigger a rebound. While the MACD is negative at -1.176, a shift could align with the anticipated altcoin season. As the market turns bullish, AVAX could capitalize on these signals and surge ahead.

Despite the recent price decline across the cryptocurrency market, whales’ interest and confidence in SHIB remain unchanged, according to an on-chain analytics report by Coinglass. 3.3 Trillion SHIB Withdrawn From Exchanges Data from the SHIB spot inflow/outflow metrics revealed that exchanges have witnessed a significant outflow of 3.3 trillion SHIB tokens, worth over $93.3 million. This substantial outflow reflects the growing interest of whales in the meme coin. Source: Coinglass The term outflow in the cryptocurrency industry refers to the movement of assets from exchanges to wallets, indicating potential upside momentum and signaling a buying opportunity. Additionally, whenever outflow increases, it reduces selling pressure and the likelihood of a price decline for the asset. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level These bullish on-chain metrics are further supported by SHIB’s technical analysis. According to expert technical analysis, SHIB appears to be gaining upside momentum, as it is currently struggling near the crucial support level of an inclined trendline. Source Historically, whenever the meme coin reaches this support level, it tends to experience upside momentum, and experts are speculating a similar rally in the coming days. Based on the recent price action, if SHIB stays above the $0.000025 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 40% to reach the $0.000039 level in the coming days. On the positive side, SHIB’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands near 52, which is below 70, indicating that it is not in the overbought zone. This suggests that the asset has enough potential to soar in the coming days. Current Price Momentum Currently, SHIB is trading near $0.00002838 and has registered a price decline of over 2.50% in the past 24 hours.

VET traded closer to its yearly highs after announcing the Renaissance Initiative with revamped tokenomics. VeChain presented its Renaissance Initiative, with renewed tokenomics and reward incentives. The announcement gave another boost to the native VET token, which trades toward its higher range for 2024. VeChain will retain its double-token model, where VET is the main asset and VTHO is used to pay for transaction fees. However, earning VTHO will now be tied to active on-chain behaviors, instead of passively holding VET. Previously, VTHO was minted at a fixed rate for any passive holder of VET. VeChain accrued more than 4.5M known wallets, while also growing its node ecosystem. | Source: VeChain Stats VTHO ownership will become a key role in the ecosystem while incentivizing more VET holding and staking for validators and node owners. This incentive structure meant long-term holders or exchanges earned VTHO but had little need for the gas payment token. The new structure will reward active users, developers, as well as network validators. After the Renaissance update, VeChain will decrease the production of VTHO and will reappoint the token to the most active users. VTHO will be rewarded to validators, the operators of X-Nodes or Economic nodes, as well as project developers. Those groups will be identified and rewarded, instead of producing VTHO based on any kind of VET ownership. Staking will also increase the share of VTHO earned. VeChain to overhaul validator structure VeChain will also overhaul its node and validator structure. Validators will now have no limit to their staked VET, to encourage more locked tokens. Owners of X nodes and Economic nodes will also be able to stake their VET with one of the 101 large-scale validators. VeChain will also introduce a new type of node, to encourage new entrants. The new tier will be part of the Economic nodes and will require a stake under the current 1M VET stake. After overhauling VTHO incentives, VeChain will also introduce variable fees, which will adjust during periods of network congestion. Can VET regain its peak valuation? VET traded above $0.06, with the highest volumes in 2024 so far. VET returned to price levels not seen since before the 2022 market crash. VET peaked above $0.22 during the 2021 bull market and has since gone through significant drawdowns and price stagnation as low as $0.01. VET trading is yet to break above $100M in open interest, lagging behind other older altcoins and tokens. The most attractive feature of VET for traders is its years-long accumulation, followed by a steep rally. In the case of a sustained altcoin market, VET may add to its gains. The tokenomics overhaul drew attention to the asset, though with limited immediate price action. VeChain has also lagged behind other trends, as it is not widely used as an L1 network for building apps. VeChain has also lagged in the creation of Web3 products, instead focusing on its partners and their varied business models. VET has underperformed in past years, as it has been obscured by more actively promoted projects. However, VET remains a highly liquid token, with listings on Binance, Coinbase, Bithumb, and other top exchanges. The asset may recover as it remains a staple among the top 50 coins and tokens. VeChain is also tracked by Grayscale as a project under consideration. VET was another one of the ‘dinosaur coins’ to rally in 2024, after going through several bull and bear cycles. VET has already gone through one token swap, doing a 1:100 token split to better reflect the asset’s utility. VeChain has been around since 2015, aiming for organic growth and partnerships with real-world businesses. VeChain tried to join the NFT trend via VeSea, but the marketplace is no longer active. The project focuses on QR codes and RFID chip tracking while connecting physical products to its native blockchain. Despite the Web3 trend and DeFi, VeChain did not develop the same tools as other projects and is not considered a competitor among L1 networks.

To read full editions, subscribe . Grayscale-related headlines have been aplenty this year, from GBTC’s conversion to an ETF, its outflows , the product’s spin-off , more filings and trust launches , yada yada. A tangential update (also surfacing today) is that Grayscale’s former CEO , Michael Sonnenshein, joined Securitize as its chief operating officer. So the ex-leader of one of the largest crypto asset managers shifts his focus to bringing real-world assets (RWA) onchain — “which candidly I think is one of the most exciting frontiers in the broader blockchain and digital assets space,” Sonnenshein told me this morning. While at Grayscale, Sonnenshein worked on bringing digital assets into more traditional wrappers. At Securitize, he acknowledged, it’ll pretty much be the other way around. The tokenized RWA market has lots of room to run before some lofty projections are met. One point of agreement at Brooklyn’s RWA Summit I attended in October was that the specific utility and benefits (and the economics behind that) will be what drives tokenization forward. Tokenized fiat currencies (aka stablecoins, a roughly $200 billion market) are well-established. Securitize helped BlackRock tokenize its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) in March, which has helped spotlight another use case . After all, US Treasurys (which BUIDL is backed by) are the collateral serving as the “substrate” for many capital markets transactions, Sonnenshein said. He added: “Continuing to build products that can address some of the inefficiencies and … move into offerings where the underlying assets are not dollars, but instead yield-bearing assets, I think is a very, very attractive value proposition.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

The crypto analyst’s optimism stems from XRP’s recent 485% surge, moving from $0.49 to $2.87 in just five weeks. Breaking through a seven-year downtrend, XRP has defied skeptics, proving that its price action is far from over. Currently trading at $2.48 , XRP would require a 338% increase to reach its projected price. Some crypto analysts even argue that XRP’s current valuation is conservative, predicting a 1,940% gain to prices as high as $48.12. Whether or not the analysts’ targets are met, XRP’s resurgence is a testament to its relevance in the crypto world.

37559437,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52007,1734038218,"Updated Timelines for Shiba Inu (SHIB) to Reach $0.0001, $0.001, and $0.01","Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced significant growth in recent months, rallying by 121% after hitting a low of $0.000013 in early August. This recovery has led to updated projections for SHIB’s journey toward critical price milestones: $0.0001, $0.001, and $0.01. Overview of SHIB’s Recent Growth In August, Shiba Inu’s price dropped below $0.000013 amid widespread declines in the crypto market, largely attributed to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. However, SHIB has since rebounded strongly, reaching $0.00002882 in early November. This resurgence has prompted analysts and AI models to update their predictions for the token’s long-term price potential. When Will Shiba Inu (SHIB) Reach $0.0001? To reach $0.0001, Shiba Inu must increase by 266.97% from its current price. While this target is modest compared to other projections, it exceeds SHIB’s previous all-time high (ATH) of $0.00008845, recorded on October 28, 2021. If achieved, SHIB’s market cap would rise to $58.92 billion, assuming its circulating supply of 589.25 trillion tokens remains stable. According to experts at Changelly, SHIB is expected to reach $0.0001 by 2027. Their projections suggest that in 2027, Shiba Inu could trade at a minimum of $0.000103, an average of $0.000107, and a maximum of $0.000127. ChatGPT, an AI model, offers three scenarios for SHIB to reach this target. The optimistic timeline places SHIB at $0.0001 between 2025 and 2027, driven by adoption, token burns, and a strong bull market. A moderate projection estimates this could happen between 2027 and 2029, fueled by Shibarium’s blockchain adoption and broader market growth. The pessimistic outlook suggests SHIB may not hit $0.0001 until 2030 or later, citing slow adoption as a limiting factor. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Forecast for $0.001 Shiba Inu (SHIB) For Shiba Inu to reach $0.001, a 3,371% increase from its current price is required. Achieving this milestone would push SHIB’s market capitalization to $589.25 billion, assuming no significant changes in circulating supply. Changelly’s analysts predict SHIB could achieve this target by 2033, marking it as the token’s maximum price for that year. ChatGPT outlines three possible timelines for this milestone. Under an optimistic scenario, SHIB could reach $0.001 between 2030 and 2034, driven by institutional adoption and significant token burns. A moderate forecast places the timeline between 2035 and 2040, citing gradual growth and increased adoption as key factors. The $0.01 SHIB Dream The most ambitious goal for SHIB is reaching $0.01, which would require a staggering 36,610% increase from its current price. At this level, Shiba Inu’s market cap would skyrocket to $5.89 trillion, surpassing Bitcoin’s current market valuation. Despite the challenges, Changelly experts believe this milestone is achievable, projecting it could happen by October 2040. They view this as SHIB’s maximum potential price within that timeframe. ChatGPT presents a more cautious view, offering an optimistic timeline of 2035 to 2045, contingent on significant token burns reducing the circulating supply by over 90%. In contrast, the moderate and pessimistic scenarios dismiss the likelihood of SHIB reaching $0.01 in the coming decades without transformative changes in market conditions. While Shiba Inu’s recent rally has reignited hopes for higher price milestones, achieving these targets depends on various factors.

37558621,https://crypto.news/?p=14318729,1734038144,"Crypto’s next big thing isn’t meme coins, it’s stablecoins","While meme coins sparked a frenzy among retail traders, stablecoins seem to emerge as crypto’s most promising innovation so far. The meme coin craze keeps going strong, even though regulators are being cautious because of their wild price swings. While these tokens can offer huge returns, the real game-changer might be something that seems less exciting and even a bit boring — stablecoins. In fact, stablecoins seem to gain support even from the camp, which was initially afraid of crypto at all, which was big banks. Citi Wealth strategists emphasized in a recent research report that stablecoins “could end up reinforcing the U.S. dollar’s dominance,” adding further that activity has reached record highs, with $5.5 trillion in value across Q1 2024. “Rather than usurping the dollar, therefore, this variety of cryptocurrency could thus make dollars more accessible to the world and reinforce the U.S. currency’s longstanding global dominance.” Citi Wealth Unlike Bitcoin ( BTC ), their value doesn’t swing wildly, making these assets useful for daily payments, savings, and lending. Most stablecoins are backed by reserves like cash or U.S. Treasuries, ensuring they maintain their value. Oddly enough, stablecoins initially started as tools for crypto traders. They let traders hold funds in a digital dollar instead of converting them back to real dollars. However, as of today, their use has expanded significantly as many people now use them for cross-border payments, savings, and even loans. State of stablecoins Stablecoins grow fast. Like, really fast. Since their launch in 2014, they’ve reached a market value of more than $200 billion, per data from CoinGecko. In 2024, Citi claims that $5.5 trillion worth of transactions involved stablecoins, adding that that’s more than Visa, which processed $3.9 trillion. Popular stablecoins include Tether ( USDT ), USD Coin ( USDC ), and decentralized DAI ( DAI ). Together, they dominate the market, but they differ in accessibility. Total stablecoin market capitalization | Source: Citi Wealth In Europe, with the MiCA regulation coming up, DAI and USDT might be dropped as big crypto exchanges like Coinbase plan to stop offering them due to new regulations. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino criticized the EU’s rules, saying MiCA’s stablecoin regulations could pose “systemic risks” to European banks. It’s not developed countries leading the charge for stablecoin use, but emerging markets are playing a bigger role. In places with weak currencies, people turn to stablecoins to access dollars, according to data from blockchain firm Chainalysis. This is especially true in countries like Argentina, where inflation makes local money unreliable, as stablecoins are faster and cheaper than traditional bank transfers. Stablecoins and competition with US dollar Stablecoins are not just a crypto trend. They seem to reinforce the power of the U.S. dollar. Around 93% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar, Citi’s strategists note. This makes dollars more accessible globally, especially in countries where access to U.S. banks is limited. Citi notes this could further strengthen the dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency. You might also like: Ripple secures New York regulatory nod for stablecoin However, stablecoins are not without risks. Issues like issuer insolvency, custodian problems, and “de-pegging” can arise. Some stablecoins have collapsed in the past, while others have temporarily lost their peg. Regulators are watching closely, and new rules in the U.S. and Europe aim to make stablecoins safer for users. Trillion dollar opportunity The main backers of stablecoins aren’t retail users in emerging markets but venture capitalists who seem to be very excited about them. https://twitter.com/masonnystrom/status/1864813870574936483 Californian venture capital firm Pantera Capital calls stablecoins a “trillion-dollar opportunity,” pointing out they now account for over 50% of blockchain transactions, up from just 3% in 2020. “In a short period of time, stablecoins have showcased their ability to be one of the transformative innovations within crypto. And 2024 has been a breakout moment for stablecoins, transacting over ~$5 trillion in adjusted volume, over $1 billion transactions, across nearly 200 million accounts.” Pantera Capital Pantera Capital sees stablecoins as a solution for the trillion-dollar cross-border payment market. With global remittances also generating billions each year, Pantera believes stablecoins are on track to make cross-border payments via crypto a reality. Pantera Capital is not alone in betting big on stablecoins. Startup accelerator Y Combinator earlier even included stablecoins as a separate category for funding requests, emphasizing their potential. Brad Floar, group partner at Y Combinator says it’s “clear that stablecoins will be a big part of the future of money.” Future of stablecoins The stablecoin market is still growing, with companies working on tools to make payments and conversions easier. Platforms like BitPay and Coinbase Commerce allow businesses to accept stablecoins and quickly convert them to fiat, making them more user-friendly. Regulation is obviously still in its early stages. Clear rules could help build trust and bring in more users, though regulations like MiCA have already raised concerns for major stablecoin issuers. One thing’s for sure: as stablecoins continue to grow, their impact on global finance will likely increase.

37558986,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-ico-opportunities-lessons-from-ethereum-and-the-promise-of-this-new-emerging-altcoin/,1734038119,Missed ICO Opportunities: Lessons from Ethereum and the Promise of This New Emerging Altcoin,"The cryptocurrency world has been shaped by pivotal events, with Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) significantly launching groundbreaking projects. Ethereum’s 2014 ICO remains a benchmark of success, demonstrating the transformative potential of early investment in blockchain technology. While some investors lament missing out on Ethereum’s meteoric rise, emerging projects like Qubetics present fresh opportunities for those seeking to participate in the next wave of innovation. The Qubetics ICO: A Compelling Investment Opportunity Currently in Presale Phase 12, Qubetics offers a significant opportunity for early adopters. With weekly phases introducing a 10% price increase and a 20% hike in the final stage, the presale rewards early participation. At this stage, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.031, with over $5.7 million raised, 8,700+ holders, and 313 million tokens sold. The next phase is imminent, with a post-presale target price of $0.25 per token. The ROI potential for Qubetics is extraordinary. Analysts predict the token could reach $10 to $15 following the mainnet launch. At $10, early investors stand to achieve an ROI of approximately 32,028.61%. If the price increases to $15 per token, the ROI could reach 48,092.91%. These projections underscore the potential rewards of investing in Qubetics at its current stage. Ethereum’s ICO: A Transformational Event in Blockchain History Ethereum’s ICO, conducted in July 2014, was a turning point in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Over 42 days, Ethereum raised $18.3 million by offering Ether (ETH) tokens at a rate of 2,000 ETH for 1 Bitcoin (BTC). This equated to an average price of $0.31 per ETH. By the time the ICO concluded on September 2, 2014, over 60 million ETH had been sold to investors, setting the stage for the platform’s groundbreaking advancements. Fast-forward to today. Ethereum has become the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, with ETH trading at prices far exceeding $3,000 at its peak. For those who participated in its ICO, the returns have been extraordinary. Ethereum’s success demonstrated the viability of ICOs as a fundraising mechanism and underscored the potential of blockchain technology to revolutionise industries. However, not all investors had the foresight or opportunity to participate in Ethereum’s early days. Missing out on such an opportunity can be a source of regret, highlighting the importance of identifying and investing in promising blockchain projects during their formative stages. Qubetics: Unlocking Interoperability in Blockchain The blockchain ecosystem today faces a critical challenge: fragmentation. Various networks operate in silos, creating barriers to seamless data exchange and cross-chain transactions. This lack of interoperability limits the potential of decentralised applications (dApps) and hampers the widespread adoption of blockchain technology. Qubetics aims to solve this problem by becoming a Web3-aggregated chain that unifies multiple networks into a cohesive framework. By enabling seamless asset transfers, data sharing, and cross-chain functionality, Qubetics will enhance interoperability and collaboration across ecosystems. This integration unlocks the full potential of decentralised technologies for developers, enterprises, and users alike, fostering innovation and adoption on a broader scale. Missed Opportunities and Future Potential For those who regret missing out on Ethereum’s ICO, projects like Qubetics present an opportunity to learn from the past and invest in the future. Ethereum’s journey from a $0.31 ICO price to becoming a global leader in blockchain technology exemplifies the transformative potential of early investment. Similarly, Qubetics offers a chance to be part of a project that addresses critical challenges and drives blockchain innovation forward. Conclusion: Seizing the Next Big Opportunity The dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market continually presents new opportunities for investors. While missing out on landmark ICOs like Ethereum can be disheartening, projects like Qubetics offer a fresh chance to participate in the growth of blockchain technology. Qubetics is positioned to become a key player in the Web3 landscape by addressing the critical interoperability issue and fostering collaboration across ecosystems. As with any investment, due diligence is essential. However, for those seeking to invest in the next wave of blockchain innovation, Qubetics represents a compelling opportunity. By taking action now, investors can position themselves to benefit from the project’s potential and avoid the regret of missing out on another transformative ICO.

This move is part of El Salvador’s plan to collaborate with over 25 countries, sharing expertise to build effective crypto regulations in Latin America. On December 11, Juan Carlos Reyes, president of El Salvador’s National Commission of Digital Assets (NCDA), and Roberto Silva, president of Argentina’s National Securities Commission (CNV), signed a mutual agreement. This focuses on regulation and innovation within the digital asset sector. El Salvador pioneering partnership with other nations on crypto Reyes mentioned the potential of this collaboration, saying Argentina’s innovative blockchain industry combined with El Salvador’s technological expertise will result in a “highly productive partnership.” Argentina already has companies registered in El Salvador, demonstrating this alliance’s practical benefits. Reyes highlighted that El Salvador’s three years of experience in digital asset regulation provide a strong advantage in guiding other countries regarding regulations in Crypto as many are adopting currently. El Salvador isn’t stopping with Argentina. Talks are underway with over 25 countries for similar agreements. Reyes stressed the importance of cross-border collaboration to elaborate crypto adoption and global regulation. He said, “Our experience has shown that cross-border knowledge sharing is essential for creating a safe and effective regulatory environment, and we encourage other regulators to prioritize this approach.” El Salvador has assembled a 20-member team of Bitcoin and crypto experts to ensure effective collaboration. Their goal is to assist other nations in establishing clear and effective regulations to prevent scams and money laundering in the industry. While El Salvador has faced criticism for its bold Bitcoin initiatives, such as making the cryptocurrency legal tender, the country has gained valuable experience. This knowledge is now being leveraged to support other nations in building well-regulated crypto frameworks. El Salvador is nearing final agreements with two more countries as part of a broader strategy. Reyes believes sharing experiences across borders is essential to creating a safe and effective environment for digital assets. Argentina’s role in the partnership Argentina’s President Javier Milei has supported cryptocurrencies in tackling inflation, making the country an ideal partner. Reyes praised Argentina’s high adoption rate and innovative blockchain ecosystem, calling it a significant reason for the collaboration. This agreement sets the stage for further regional cooperation, innovation, and knowledge-sharing to build a strong digital asset industry in Latin America. As El Salvador forms global partnerships, including with Argentina, to strengthen crypto adoption and establish itself as a leader in digital asset regulation and innovation.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Dogecoin, Pepe, and XYZVerse prepare for a high-stakes, hype-fueled meme coin championship in 2025. Table of Contents XYZVerse: The all-sport meme coin Pepe Dogecoin Conclusion As the crypto market surges toward new peaks, three meme coins — Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE), and the newcomer XYZVerse (XYZ) — are capturing the spotlight. Dogecoin’s legacy, PEPE’s momentum, and XYZVerse’s unique approach set the stage for an exciting competition. XYZVerse: The all-sport meme coin While Dogecoin relies on its legacy and PEPE banks on recent buzz, XYZVerse brings something entirely fresh: An all-sport meme coin that merges meme hilarity with the enthusiasm of global sports fandom. Picture the staggering $1 billion trading volume Polymarket achieved during the US election frenzy. Now, infuse that atmosphere with meme coin hype, sports betting action, and millions of fans ready to jump into the fray. With XYZVerse, this isn’t just a fantasy — it’s an ecosystem on the verge of significant expansion. While past meme coin champions like BOME and WIF dazzled with their incredible returns, XYZVerse sets its sights even higher. With a 9,900% growth target by the TGE, it’s positioned to outpace rival gains and shoot for the top of the leaderboard. As major CEX/DEX listings, audited contracts, and a vetted team bolster its credibility, XYZVerse flexes a strong defensive line to maintain investor confidence. Early adopters gain a first-mover edge, riding the wave of a community-driven, sports-fueled ecosystem long before the crowd realizes it’s time to join in. The crypto championship of 2025 is shaping up to be a fierce contest, and XYZVerse is ready to dominate. Interested investors can get XYZ tokens via the presale . Pepe PEPE has been making waves in the crypto market, with its price jumping by 12.82% in the past week. Looking at the last month, the increase is at 70.42%. Over six months, PEPE has surged by 109.24%. This upward trend shows strong interest and momentum behind the coin. Currently, PEPE is trading between $0.00002112 and $0.000028426. The nearest resistance level is at $0.00003048. If it breaks through this point, the next target is $0.00003982, representing a significant gain from its current price. On the support side, levels at $0.00001582 and $0.000007486 could provide stability if the price dips. Dogecoin Over the past six months, Dogecoin’s price has surged by 189.40%, reflecting sustained interest. DOGE’s Relative Strength Index stands at 57.91, indicating bullish sentiment. The MACD level is positive at 0.0028, which often signals upward movement. However, the Stochastic oscillator is at 76.27, suggesting the asset may be approaching overbought levels. Looking ahead, the nearest resistance level is at $0.54. If DOGE breaks this barrier, it could target the second resistance at $0.64, representing a potential gain of up to 28% from the current price. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $0.35. Falling to the second support at $0.25 would mean a decrease of around 39%. Conclusion Dogecoin and Pepe have made their marks, but XYZVerse’s fusion of sports and memes positions it as a strong contender in the 2025 meme coin race.

Ver says in a new interview with Tucker Carlson that Bitcointalk.org, an early BTC forum, was flooded with bots the same week Bitcoin started to get worldwide media attention for the first time. “Somebody out there literally made the forum unusable as early as 2011. And around that same time, we already know that the CIA was interested in Bitcoin because they were asking different Bitcoin developers, ‘Hey can you explain Bitcoin to us?’ So way back when the vast majority of the world hadn’t even heard of Bitcoin yet, the CIA was looking into it and somebody was actively preventing it from spreading as quickly as it otherwise could have by shutting down the forum effectively when so many new people were coming to Bitcoin to learn about it for the first time.” Ver, an early investor of Bitcoin who later decided to support the BCH fork, claims that propaganda, possibly from US intelligence agencies, was spread to trick people into believing it was important to keep the BTC block sizes small. Ver was a vocal “big-blocker” in the Bitcoin Blocksize War who wanted to increase BTC block sizes to enable cheaper, faster transactions. “Small blockers” like Blockstream chief executive Adam Back argued that Bitcoin’s original 1MB-sized blocks kept the network decentralized. Ver was arrested in Spain in late April at the direction of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and faces multiple charges, including mail fraud, tax evasion and filing false tax returns. Despite renouncing his United States citizenship in 2014 after obtaining citizenship in Saint Kitts and Nevis, authorities say Ver should’ve filed tax returns that reported capital gains from the sale of his worldwide assets, including his Bitcoin, and reported the fair market value of his assets.

Source: texas.gov Bitcoin Taxes and Donations? Texas Proposes a Bold Plan to Build a Crypto Reserve Republican State Representative Giovanni Capriglione announced the proposed legislation during an X Spaces event on Thursday. The bill to establish a ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve’ in the state of Texas was filed live on X spaces. History has been made. pic.twitter.com/8IZdoMmKYj — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) December 12, 2024 The bill outlines a plan for Texas to build its bitcoin reserve by accepting taxes, fees, and donations in bitcoin, which would be held for at least five years. Capriglione explained that the reserve aims to bolster the state’s fiscal stability while showcasing its leadership in bitcoin adoption. Capriglione emphasized the importance of combating inflation, stating that a strategic bitcoin reserve represents a “win-win” investment for the state. He further elaborated that the bill, titled “An act relating to the establishment of a bitcoin reserve within the state treasury of Texas and the management of cryptocurrencies by governmental entities,” aims to introduce a flexible framework for managing cryptocurrency holdings. Texas, home to the largest concentration of bitcoin miners in the U.S., could see some miners paying taxes in bitcoin under the proposed legislation. However, the initial bill does not include a strategy for direct Bitcoin purchases by the state. Capriglione expressed his intent to expand the bill’s scope, aiming for broader support from legislators. Bitcoin Boom: States Lead the Charge as Federal Crypto Policies Divide Opinions The idea of a strategic Bitcoin reserve aligns with broader discussions at the national level. President-elect Donald Trump has previously indicated support for a national Bitcoin reserve, which has fueled market speculation. At the Bitcoin 2024 conference in July, Donald Trump announced that, if elected, he would prevent the U.S. government from selling Bitcoin seized in criminal cases. Following his presidential election victory on Nov. 5, Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, a Republican and vocal crypto advocate, revealed plans to propose legislation for the U.S. government to purchase 1 million BTC and hold it for at least 20 years. However, not everyone supports the idea. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers criticized the plan on Dec. 5, calling it “crazy” and suggesting it was an attempt to appease campaign donors. Other former officials have voiced similar doubts. Bitcoin prices have surged by over 45% as investors anticipate potential policy shifts favoring cryptocurrency. Despite the enthusiasm, analysts remain skeptical about the U.S. establishing a Bitcoin reserve in the near term. States across the U.S. are taking the lead in exploring Bitcoin-related legislation. Pennsylvania recently introduced its own strategic bitcoin reserve bill , and several other states, including Oklahoma, Louisiana, Montana, and Arkansas, have passed laws protecting cryptocurrency mining and self-custody rights. Porter, an advisor on Capriglione’s bill, noted that as many as 10 states and four countries are considering similar legislation. The post Texas Rep.

According to a release by Zeus, this development bridges the gap between two distinct blockchain ecosystems, enabling Bitcoin transactions to leverage Solana’s fast and cost-effective infrastructure. Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Solana ( SOL ) operate on separate protocols, with Bitcoin utilizing proof-of-work and Solana combining proof-of-history with proof-of-stake. Zeus Network’s ( ZEUS ) infrastructure acts as a bridge, allowing Bitcoin to be tokenized and transacted on Solana without altering Bitcoin’s original protocol. https://twitter.com/ZeusNetworkHQ/status/1867273839484580085 The process involved replicating Bitcoin’s blockchain on Solana using Zeus Network’s core components — the ZeusNode Operator and Zeus Program Library.

At least for a little while. The Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday delayed its vote to confirm SEC Caroline Crenshaw, whose term ended in June. After the vote — which was scheduled to take place Wednesday morning — was pushed to later in the afternoon, Senate Republicans were able to block it as late-in-the-day votes require unanimous approval. The vote has not yet been rescheduled. Should Crenshaw not be confirmed before the Senate adjourns for the session next week, President-elect Donald Trump will have the opportunity to nominate a replacement, although no more than three commissioners may be of the same political party. Trump appointed Crenshaw in 2020 and President Biden renominated her earlier this year.

Chair Gary Gensler and Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga, both Democrats, last month announced they would be resigning from the agency in January. Trump earlier this month announced he would be nominating Republican Paul Atkins to chair the agency. Upon Gensler’s departure, Trump is expected to name either Hester Peirce or Mark Uyeda, both sitting Republican commissioners, as acting chair while the Senate completes Atkins’s confirmation process. Wednesday’s vote delay comes as pro-crypto lobbying efforts heat up in Washington DC. Stand With Crypto, a non-profit launched by crypto exchange Coinbase, said Thursday that it opposes Crenshaw’s nomination. “Anti-crypto regulators must not be confirmed,” the non-profit added.

Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trumps-tariffs-trumptar-solana-memecoin-will-explode-16000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

This happened after Stewart compared investing in tokens to gambling. In his remarks, Stewart mentioned that he had only a basic understanding of blockchain, prompting Mark Cuban to offer a detailed explanation of cryptocurrency. While explaining, he likened Bitcoin to digital gold. He went further and explained how Gensler regulated several tokens as securities. He also regulated supply limits, factoring in cryptocurrency’s store of value. Acknowledging Cuban’s explanation, Stewart apologized for making him do the explanations remedially, but he said he needed to know because he hadn’t understood the crypto concept well. A veteran host, Stewart is not the only comedian uncertain about the crypto industry. Back in 2020, one of the Bitcoin enthusiasts and advocates hosted the comedian Bill Burr on the podcast, prompting him to say he would invest in crypto. Vice President Kamala’s administration’s policy on crypto cost her presidency Mark Cuban, the co-founder of Cost Plus Drugs, also insinuated that Vice President Kamala’s loss in the US presidential election is related to cryptocurrency. On the December 12 episode, Cuban narrated how he strongly advised the Harris campaign team to focus on young men in their campaigns. His conviction came from the youth’s affinity for crypto and feeling part of the community. He went on to say that he had conversations with Vice President Kamala and SEC chair Gensler, during which he told them that the administration’s policies on crypto would negatively affect her election outcome. To stress this conversation, Cuban said on the podcast: There’s an argument to be made when you look at the numbers: a whole lot of young men voted against Kamala Harris, and I think crypto had a lot to do with it. ~ Mark Cuban Mark Cuban eyed the SEC position Cuban had hoped to replace Gensler in the SEC if Vice President Kamala was victorious on November 5. After Trump was declared the winner of the presidential election, he categorically stated his plan to nominate former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins to chair the SEC. President-elect Donald Trump had shown interest in crypto during his campaigns. During a convention in Nashville, he told the crowd that if elected, his administration would make it a US policy to hold on to any Bitcoin the government owns or may acquire. Cryptocurrency has existed for almost one and a half decades, but it has always generated debate, especially in Washington, DC. Its volatility has never stopped investors from believing in its potential, but regulations have been a gap. There are states in the US that have made their own regulations, but the federal government has remained behind, leaving crypto investors without proper guidance. Although Cuban believes in the decentralized nature of crypto, he believes some regulations protect regular investors.

According to Bloomberg , the BlackRock Investment Institute released a paper on December 12 saying that a Bitcoin allocation of up to 2% is a “reasonable range” for multi-asset portfolios. BlackRock’s analysis indicates that a 1% to 2% Bitcoin weighting in a typical portfolio of stocks and bonds would have a similar risk profile to holding the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks. The paper also emphasizes a “risk budgeting” approach, acknowledging Bitcoin’s volatility while recognizing its potential for diversification benefits. “Even though Bitcoin’s correlation to other assets is relatively low, it’s more volatile, making its effect on total risk contribution similar overall,” the authors wrote. “A Bitcoin allocation would have the advantage of providing a diverse source of risk, while an overweight to the “Magnificent Seven” would add to existing risk and to portfolio concentration.” BlackRock Invests Big as Bitcoin Breaks Records BlackRock ‘s paper arrives while Bitcoin reaches record highs above $100,000 , fueled by growing mainstream adoption and favorable regulatory developments worldwide. Bitcoin has surged to an all-time high of $104,000, pushing its market dominance up by 4.4% to 57%. #Bitcoin #Dominance https://t.co/TSh2OAo4gl — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 5, 2024 Since 2011, Bitcoin has seen a 20,000,000% rise, overshadowing the gains of the Nasdaq 100 index, which grew by 541%. According to Coinglass data, it also outperformed major US stock indices, which saw a 282% increase. Bitcoin’s annualized return of 230% also places it far ahead of all other asset classes. This is ten times higher than the Nasdaq 100, the second-best performer. Over the same period, large US stocks returned 14% annually, high-yield bonds yielded 5.4%, and gold saw a 1.5% return. This increase in Bitcoin price is partly driven by the launch of US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January. As of December 11, these ETFs have attracted more than $113 billion in assets since their debut. Investors poured in nearly $10 billion since Trump’s presidential victory on November 5, according to SoSoValue data. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, leads the pack with more than $35 billion in cumulative net inflows. On November 23, BlackRock invested $2 billion in Bitcoin and currently holds $48.4 billion in the leading cryptocurrency, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. This purchase far exceeds the combined investment of all other ETFs, totaling only $71 million that day.

In September, BlackRock called Bitcoin a “unique diversifier,” highlighting its low long-term correlation to traditional assets such as stocks and bonds despite some short-term similarities. Bitcoin’s scarcity, decentralized nature and global accessibility were cited as key reasons for its potential to hedge against geopolitical and monetary risks .

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Pepe Unchained (PEPU) surges 400% two days after IEO, viral Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) emerges as the next contender for massive gains. Table of Contents Pepe Unchained flips Chill Guy Pepe now has his Ethereum L2 blockchain Why Wall Street Pepe could be the next Pepe Unchained Pepe Unchained presale investors are deep in the money as the token’s price surged 400% in the first two days of trading. Investors are now seeking rotation plays that could amplify their PEPU presale gains, with Wall Street Pepe gaining significant attention. Pepe Unchained flips Chill Guy After the Pepe Unchained sell out presale raised $73 million, traders had high hopes for its exchange launch. However, not many people foresaw its success happening so fast. After just 48 hours, the token flipped the infamous ‘Just a Chill Guy’ meme coin, which was widely tipped as the next Dogecoin thanks to its organic prominence on social media apps like TikTok. Pepe Unchained is looking further ahead and eyeing tokens like MooDeng and the first-ever Pepe-themed token, PepeCoin. With its out-of-the-gate success, it’s no surprise that Pepe Unchained has everyone’s attention. It currently takes the top spot on CoinMarketCap’s trending list, underlining the huge star power that it holds. The token is currently trading at $0.04743, up 129% today and 400% since launching. It holds a $389 million market cap and a $34 million 24-hour trading volume, up 36% today. It’s important to note that Pepe Unchained’s trading volume has only occurred on Uniswap. For comparison, Pepe, which holds a $10 billion market cap, has processed $20 million in on-chain volume in the past 24 hours, 50% less than Pepe Unchained. Pepe now has his Ethereum L2 blockchain Analysts who paid attention to Pepe Unchained in presale preempted its meteoric rise. For instance, Jacob Bury told the 99Bitcoins YouTube channel viewers that Pepe Unchained could 100x. The reason being is that Pepe Unchained holds a first-in-class use case: it’s the only Pepe-themed token with its own blockchain. The Pepe Unchained team launched an Ethereum layer 2 network that is 100x faster and a lot cheaper than the Ethereum mainnet. It has features like a block explorer, a dedicated Ethereum bridge, staking, and a decentralized exchange. Moreover, the team will soon launch a meme coin generator that allows users to create a meme coin in two clicks without coding. This will bring something similar to Solana’s Pump.fun to the Ethereum ecosystem, which holds significantly more liquidity. The project also has tier-1 exchange listings and a billboard sponsorship in Times Square lined up. We are ready. Are you? pic.twitter.com/xFddvk7FrU — Pepe Unchained (@pepe_unchained) December 6, 2024 The project is covering all angles. As such, this might not be the end of Pepe Unchained’s reign but the beginning. However, another alternative is emerging for those who missed the presale, and an analyst says it could be even bigger. You might also like: Meme coins enjoy ‘mini breakouts,’ market cap reaches new all-time high Why Wall Street Pepe could be the next Pepe Unchained Not only did Pepe Unchained implement market-moving utility into its project, but it also rode the viral hype wave of Pepe coin. The bold approach to development and branding caught the eye of investors and caused Pepe Unchained’s price to explode. Wall Street Pepe follows the same playbook. The project blends the laid-back vibe of Pepe coin with the electric energy of Jordan Belfort, curating a new persona for Pepe the Frog that aims to build an army of degen traders who “choose rich.” Like Pepe Unchained, Wall Street Pepe is a seriously sophisticated setup. The platform will provide traders with institutional-grade tools to beat the market. These include trading signals, meme coin picks, alpha calls, a trading insider group, staking, and trading rewards. With a comprehensive ecosystem geared toward making holders money, coupled with the viral allure of being a Pepe alternative, traders expect big things from Wall Street Pepe. ClayBro told his 130k YouTube subscribers that Wall Street Pepe will perform even better than Pepe Unchained on its DEX launch, anticipating immediate 20x gains. The Wall Street Pepe presale has raised $6 million in nine days, a figure that Pepe Unchained took over one month to achieve. The current $WEPE price is $0.000211, but this will rise in three days.

37558082,https://blockworks.co/news/us-canada-central-bank-influences,1734035719,"Why rate changes impact the US, Canadian economies differently","This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . For those who don’t know, I’m Canadian. However, I spent nearly every hour of the day thinking about macro from a US perspective. In the world of markets, the US is at the center and everything else is secondary. Reflecting on the two worlds I live in poses an interesting vignette as to why it feels like the Fed keeps stopping and starting on its approach to monetary policy with respect to the economy. The Canadian unemployment rate just hit a cycle high of 6.8% and looks to be climbing even higher, whereas the US’s unemployment rate seems to be flatlining. Yes, both economies were affected by an increase in labor supply caused by immigration, but the Canadian labor market is worse across the board. Canada has managed to get its inflation rate back to 2% on a year-over-year basis, while the US remains stubbornly above target: The Bank of Canada just surprised markets this week by going for another 50-basis point rate cut vs. the recent 25bps cuts they’ve been doing. The US is expected to squeeze in one more rate cut next week before pausing for a while as the economy continues to surprise to the upside. So what gives? What’s driving the discrepancy between two similar economies that trade quite closely? Simply put, the US financial system is much less sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates than Canada’s. Here are two examples: Corporations US companies have access to the largest debt markets in the world and can issue fixed-rate bonds at tight spreads, whereas Canadian companies (as is normal in non-US countries) are more inclined to issue floating-rate debt, which changes instantly with changes in central bank policy rate. Households In the US, homeowners can sit on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage and as long as they don’t move, the Fed could hike rates to 50% and it still wouldn’t affect them. The rate they’ve locked in is the one for the entire mortgage. Considering how many households refinanced their mortgages at the Covid lows (sub-3%), as long as they don’t move, they’re unabated by increasing interest rates. This is very different in Canada and most other countries, where even on a 25-year fixed-rate mortgage, the rate gets reset every five years. Therefore, even if homeowners stay put, they will eventually be affected by the increase in rates. These two examples showcase why the Fed is having so much trouble getting into a consistent policy path — its main tool cannot impact large swaths of the economy like it can in other countries. And so here we are instead, with increasing dispersion in economies between the US and everybody else. Oh, sweet US exceptionalism.

37557583,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626740,1734035438,"BlackRock: Bitcoin offers top return potential, but keep allocation at 1-2%","Bitcoin’s potential for returns is undeniable, but BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is telling investors to pump the brakes. In its latest analysis , the company recommends keeping Bitcoin allocations to a cautious 1-2% of a portfolio. This is a measured strategy to balance its sky-high return potential against its wild price swings and unique risks. With a market value pushing $2 trillion and over $100 billion of Bitcoin now parked in funds and exchange-traded products (ETPs), the apex crypto is a growing piece of the financial puzzle. The value of Bitcoin is shaped by the clash of its fixed supply and rising demand. Demand, in turn, depends on investor confidence in Bitcoin’s adoption. Case in point: Bitcoin smashed through new price records following Donald Trump’s election win, with the new administration showing strong support for industry. Bitcoin’s rising appeal and unique risks Unlike traditional assets, Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network, immune to central bank policies and government interference. This independence has drawn interest in a world riddled with geopolitical tensions and rising debt. Some governments are already moving away from the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, opting for alternatives like gold. Bitcoin, with its borderless functionality and resistance to inflation, is already a rival. Its digital design allows for instant, frictionless cross-border transactions, which adds to its appeal. But its value also comes with strings attached. Bitcoin’s history is riddled with volatility, with dramatic price drops of 70-80% not uncommon. BlackRock points out that its fragmented trading environment—spread across multiple exchanges and bespoke broker services—makes it less predictable than other assets. Another risk factor? Bitcoin’s lack of underlying cash flows. Traditional assets like stocks or bonds generate income streams, making future returns somewhat predictable. Bitcoin, on the other hand, relies purely on adoption. If adoption grows, so does its value. If adoption stagnates, the story could unravel quickly. Yet, Bitcoin has shown it can play the role of a portfolio diversifier. Its value isn’t tied to traditional economic cycles, and its low correlation with risk assets like equities and bonds makes it a unique source of returns. But BlackRock warns that during periods of market stress, Bitcoin can mirror the performance of traditional assets, reducing its appeal as a hedge. The allocation logic Why does BlackRock advocate such a small slice of the Bitcoin pie? Well, the Wall Street titan compares Bitcoin’s impact on portfolios to that of the “Magnificent 7” tech giants — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. These mega-cap stocks dominate the market, with an average value of $2.5 trillion each. While Bitcoin operates in a completely different arena, its influence on portfolio risk is comparable. In a standard 60-40 stock-bond portfolio, these tech giants contribute about 4% to overall portfolio risk. Despite Bitcoin’s lower correlation with traditional assets, its extreme volatility means a mere 1-2% allocation has a similar risk impact. Pushing beyond 2% sends Bitcoin’s share of portfolio risk skyrocketing, particularly during times of heightened market turbulence. BlackRock’s analysis suggests that keeping exposure limited is the safest way to enjoy Bitcoin’s benefits without jeopardizing portfolio stability. Unlike tech stocks, which generate substantial cash flow and have tangible assets, Bitcoin’s value rests entirely on market sentiment and adoption. In a worst-case scenario, where Bitcoin adoption collapses entirely, the loss could wipe out the entire allocation. BlackRock argues that such a collapse is less likely for the Magnificent 7, given their established market presence and cash-generating capabilities.

According to on-chain analysis shared by Lookonchain via X and verified through Etherscan, the fund purchased approximately $10 million in ETH, $1 million in AAVE, and $1 million in LINK on December 11. These are the fund’s first recorded acquisitions of both AAVE and LINK, while overall purchases in the last 12 days total around $30 million in USDC spent to secure more than 8,000 ETH at an average price of $3,701.

Related Reading: Chainlink Price Shines With 40% Rally — Is $28.5 Possible? The surge coincides with World Liberty Financial’s recent decision to integrate Chainlink’s technology. Last month, WLF announced that it “will leverage Chainlink as the standard for onchain data and cross-chain interoperability” to secure its protocol ecosystem. The press release described Chainlink as “the most secure solution for solving critical security, interoperability, and onchain data problems” while noting that this would “kick off the next wave of DeFi mass adoption” for WLFI. The platform plans to integrate Chainlink Price Feeds on Ethereum mainnet in anticipation of deploying a World Liberty Financial version of Aave’s v3 instance, pending governance approval. Related Reading: Whale Activity Sparks Chainlink Rally, $52 Target On Traders’ Radar In October, WLF submitted a proposal on the Aave governance forums seeking to deploy its own Aave v3 environment. Aave founder Stani Kulechov has confirmed that WLF’s instance is not a direct fork of Aave’s code but operates as a segregated version tied to separate, KYC-compliant front-ends. While this means WLF is tapping into the largest smart contract-compatible public blockchain and leveraging core decentralized finance primitives, it also maintains stringent compliance requirements. The project is initially limited to accredited investors within the United States. AAVE, which has risen by roughly 138% over the last five weeks, is also showing technical resilience. Today’s price action pushed it above the 0.5 Fib level at $356.84 (drawn from the all-time high to the cycle low). If this level holds on a weekly closing basis, upside targets could include the 0.618 Fib at $430.29, the 0.786 Fib at $534.87, and ultimately the ATH from May 2021 at $668. Chainlink’s performance over the past five weeks has been particularly strong, posting a gain of more than 175%. The most critical technical resistance level now appears to be the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement at $28.88. A decisive break above this level could open the path to the 0.618 Fib at $34.57, the 0.786 Fib at $42.67, and potentially the all-time high (ATH) from May 2021 at $53.

37557831,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319164,1734035294,Dogecoin Price Could Dump 50% Soon – But Here’s Why You Should Still Be Bullish,"As the Dogecoin ($DOGE) price consolidates just above $0.40, investors are weighing up whether the market could be about to vault to new highs, or whether a deeper pullback could be in store. Dogecoin has come within striking distance of $0.50 on two occasions in the past two weeks. But a double top may have now formed, suggesting the bears could be about to regain control of this market. Other recent technical developments are also flashing warning signs. $DOGE also broke to the south of a short-term trend this week and has slipped beneath its 21DMA, further suggesting a waning of bullish momentum. If support in the $0.33-35 area in the form of the late 2021 highs were to break, a sudden 50% drop back to early 2024 highs in the $0.20 area could be on the cards. Dogecoin Price Outlook – Will the Bulls Buy the Dip? However, amid the current bullish crypto market environment, its tough to bet on such a deep pullback right now. Rhetoric from incoming US President Donald Trump remains super bullish for crypto. BREAKING: Trump confirms he hopes to open a 'strategic reserve' of cryptocurrency. Trump recently announced David Sacks as Crypto Czar. CRAMER: ""Strategic petroleum reserve-like for crypto?"" TRUMP: ""Yeah, I think so. We're gonna do something great with crypto. We don't want… pic.twitter.com/ZmA9K2QNjm — Eric Daugherty (@EricLDaugh) December 12, 2024 Expectations remain elevated that we are on the cusp of a new golden age for the US crypto industry and crypto market’s more broadly. And $DOGE remains in a particularly strong position, as the incoming Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) continues to attract a lot of attention across social media and traditional media outlets. DOGE is undergoing a serious analysis of wasteful and burdensome regulations, and is looking for public feedback! Which are the really bad ones? Please DM us the CFR provision, the relevant text from the regulation, and the adverse consequences of said regulation. — Department of Government Efficiency (@DOGE) December 12, 2024 That all but guarantees that $DOGE is going to retain a commanding percentage of “mind share” as the current crypto bull market continues to bubble. All of that suggests dips are likely to remain short-lived and the Dogecoin price is likely to continue its push towards $1 in the coming months. Holders would do well then to exercise their diamond hands, and refrain from getting shaken out by any uncomfortable short-term market dips. How High Can $DOGE Go? The outlook for the Dogecoin price is strong in the coming months, with $ 1 certainly a reasonable target . But how much further could the Dogecoin price go than this? Well, Dogecoin has arguably been through three market cycles since its inception in 2014, and the cycles can offer clues. When drawing a Fibonacci extension upwards from the prior bear market low to the prior bear market high, it can be seen that Dogecoin has always rallied well beyond the 4.236 Fibonacci level, exceeding this Fibonacci extension by over 10x during its 2021 rally. The 4.236 Fibonacci extension level from the 2022 bear market lows back to the 2021 highs suggests that Dogecoin should at least hit $3 per token this cycle. But as history has shown, Dogecoin has routinely blown well past this level. Given that context, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to expect a $10 Dogecoin price this cycle. Of course, that would imply a multi-trillion-dollar market cap, which might be a bit much to ask. But Dogecoin could definitely 10x from current levels to reach a market cap in the $100s of billions.

The Arkansas Republican was named to the role Thursday by the party's Steering Committee, which named the leaders of the various committees ahead of the 119th Congress's start next year. Hill will succeed North Carolina's Patrick McHenry, who will retire after 20 years in Congress and multiple terms leading Republicans on the Financial Services Committee.    Hill has chaired the Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion subcommittee over the past few years and cosponsored the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), a market structure bill that much of the cryptocurrency industry hoped would become law. He's also introduced or cosponsored a number of other bills over the years addressing various aspects of the crypto world.    McHenry shepherded multiple pieces of crypto legislation through the House of Representatives, including FIT21. Over the past few years, he also worked on stablecoin legislation with his counterpart, California Representative Maxine Waters, though this bill was not ultimately introduced.    Waters will again lead Democrats on the House committee after being ""unanimously"" picked by the caucus, a Wednesday press statement said.    In the statement, Waters said she was ""honored that the Democratic caucus has once again put their faith in me.""    ""I will continue the fight to improve conditions for working families across the country,"" she said. ""Under my leadership over the past few years, we’ve achieved historic progress to expand housing and address homelessness, support small businesses, and protect people from fraud.

Finding the next big crypto hit before the market rockets into its next bull run. Meme coins are more than just jokes—they’re becoming serious investment opportunities with high upside potential. Take BTFD Coin , for example. It’s already raised $3.6 million in its presale, and its combination of staking rewards and community strength is turning heads. Then there’s Brett, the Base Chain meme coin climbing steadily thanks to its growing ecosystem. And let’s not forget Act I: The AI Prophecy, a meme coin for the tech-savvy investor, blending artificial intelligence and blockchain innovation. Are you ready to refine your portfolio and ride this wave? Let’s dive into why these three coins are among the best meme coins to buy in December 2024 and how they might be your ticket to portfolio gains. BTFD Coin: The Bulls Are Running Professional traders know timing is everything, and BTFD Coin offers that perfect “ buy the dip ” opportunity. Currently in Stage 11 of its presale, it has raised an impressive $3.6 million and sold over 52 billion tokens, with the current price at $0.00012 per token. But BTFD isn’t just a presale darling—it’s a movement. Imagine this: You invest $7,500 in BTFD today. At the current presale price, you’d snag 62,500,000 BTFD tokens. When the price hits $0.0006 at the end of the presale, that investment becomes $37,500. Add in the 90% APY staking rewards, and by the time the bull run takes off in 2025, you could be sitting on enough profits to cover that dream vacation or even a significant chunk of your mortgage. But what’s really exciting is the Play-to-Earn (P2E) game beta. While earnings aren’t live yet, this game is laying the groundwork for something big—an ecosystem that blends fun and financial potential. And with a community of 4,700 “bulls” rallying behind it, BTFD Coin isn’t just a meme coin; it’s an opportunity. For traders looking to boost their portfolio before the next bull run, BTFD Coin is undoubtedly one of the best meme coins to buy in December 2024. Brett: Base Chain’s Rising Star Ever heard of a meme coin becoming a cultural icon? That’s Brett. As the unofficial mascot of Base Chain, Brett is more than just a meme—it’s a symbol of the chain’s rapid growth and expanding ecosystem. Trading at $0.1868, Brett has climbed over 44% in the past month, and its community is buzzing with activity. What’s driving this momentum? Base Chain’s ecosystem is attracting new projects and users, and Brett is at the heart of it all. Its strong foundation gives traders confidence that this isn’t just a pump-and-dump but a coin with real staying power. Is Brett the meme coin to add to your portfolio this December? If Base Chain continues to grow, Brett could see even greater gains, making it a smart play for traders aiming to capitalise on a strong ecosystem. Act I: The AI Prophecy, Where Memes Meet Tech What if memes and cutting-edge technology could come together? That’s the promise of Act I: The AI Prophecy. This isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a project focused on AI education, collaboration, and innovation, all wrapped in the charm of a decentralised community token. Trading at $0.5707 with a 16% daily increase, Act I is gaining traction among traders who see its potential as more than just a novelty. Its unique story and focus on AI literacy have created a loyal base of investors, developers, and innovators. Why should traders care? Act I’s combination of AI-focused utility and meme appeal positions it for long-term relevance. As AI becomes more integral to tech and finance, coins like Act I could become the bridge between these two worlds. If you’re a trader looking to diversify with a future-forward meme coin, Act I deserves a spot on your radar. The Bottom Line Let’s face it: the meme coin market is no longer just about hype—it’s about opportunity. Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin is redefining presale success with its $3.6 million milestone, Brett is proving that Base Chain memes can thrive, and Act I is showing us the future of AI-powered crypto.

37556753,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374422,1734034523,AAVE Surpasses $360: Bullish Momentum Driven by Influx of Dormant Tokens,"AAVE, the native token of the decentralized crypto lending platform Aave, surpassed $363 after surging by approximately 30% over the past day. This is the first time since 2021 that the asset has recorded a crucial milestone in a rally powered by a huge wave of coins moving back into circulation. Major AAVE Stakeholders Circulate Dormant Coins As highlighted by Santiment in its latest analysis , this surge is coupled with a significant drop in the “Mean Dollar Invested Age,” a key indicator suggesting that major stakeholders are moving previously dormant tokens back into circulation. This influx of active coins plays an important role in driving bullish momentum for AAVE. Additionally, the on-chain crypto analytic platform noted that active traders have experienced massive returns, with 30-day and 365-day gains of over 96% and 290%, respectively. However, Santiment warns that the current rally’s sustainability depends on whether large holders continue to circulate older tokens. Should whales decide to halt their activity, a retracement could occur. In such a scenario, AAVE’s bullish phase risks cooling. Adding another layer of insight, Spot On Chain reported that Blockchain Capital, a prominent early investor in AAVE, deposited a significant amount of the token – 16,964 – to FalconX after two years of inactivity. This stash is worth around $5.06 million. It is important to note that Blockchain Capital acquired a total of 233,256 AAVE between August 2020 and March 2023, at an average price of $82.9. The venture capital firm still holds a substantial amount – 216,292 AAVE, valued at almost $79 million. This large deposit, coming after a prolonged period of inactivity, could potentially signal whales re-engaging with AAVE, aligning with Santiment’s observation that the movement of older tokens is essential for sustaining the asset’s bullish trend. Catalysts Behind AAVE’s Growth Several key developments are contributing to AAVE’s recent price surge. First, decentralized exchange (DEX) Balancer launched its V3 upgrade which introduces enhanced liquidity optimization, increased trading volume, and advanced tools for developers. Aave has partnered with Balancer to integrate its permissionless automated market maker technology with the former’s yield market infrastructure, creating 100% boosted pools. This collaboration is expected to bolster AAVE’s liquidity and trading activity, further supporting its price growth. Additionally, Aave’s upcoming launch on Linea, a zk-rollup network backed by Consensys, is another key factor. With community approval , the platform will leverage Linea’s scalability and reduced transaction fees, allowing it to process more transactions efficiently and at a lower cost, thereby increasing adoption. Lastly, the recent acquisition of $1 million worth of AAVE by President-elect Donald Trump’s DeFi project, World Liberty Financial, has added to the momentum. The project purchased AAVE tokens at an average price of $297.8, signaling strong institutional confidence in AAVE’s prospects.

Then there’s SPX6900, a token consolidating within a bullish pennant pattern, poised for a potential breakout. And let’s not forget BTFD Coin , a newcomer redefining presales with its $3.6 million milestone and promising roadmap. If you’re ready to stack your portfolio with the best meme coins to buy for 2025, these three should be at the top of your list. BTFD Coin: Your Gateway to Big Gains in 2025 Let’s talk about BTFD Coin, the presale sensation that’s already raised $3.6 million so far till Stage 11. With over 52 billion tokens sold, with its current price at $0.00012 per token, this coin is showing no signs of slowing down. But what’s got traders buzzing isn’t just the numbers—it’s the coin’s unique potential. BTFD’s Play-to-Earn (P2E) game beta is already turning heads, offering a glimpse into an engaging ecosystem that blends gaming and crypto rewards. On top of that, the 90% APY staking rewards make it one of the most lucrative meme coin investments on the market. Now, imagine this scenario: You invest $10,000 in BTFD Coin at the current presale price. That nets you 83,333,333 BTFD tokens. When the price hits $0.0006 at the end of the presale, your investment skyrockets to $50,000. Add staking rewards, and you could be looking at $95,000 by mid-2025. That’s not just an investment—it’s a game-changer for your financial future. For professional traders and newcomers alike, BTFD Coin is clearly one of the best meme coins to buy for 2025 . Popcat: The Viral Token Turning Heads Popcat is much more than a meme; it’s a symbol of crypto’s playful side with serious market potential. Trading at $1.27, Popcat has gained 3% in the last 24 hours and is showing strong upward momentum. Analysts are bullish, forecasting a 25% increase in price to $1.53 in the near term. What makes Popcat stand out? Its massive appeal among traders and institutions. On-chain analytics firm Coinglass reported growing whale activity, indicating rising confidence in the token. Popcat’s unique positioning as a meme coin with widespread recognition ensures its continued popularity, especially among Gen Z and millennial investors. Will Popcat maintain its momentum into 2025? With its rising trading volume and strong community support, it’s shaping up to be one of the best meme coins to buy for 2025. SPX6900: The Hidden Gem Eyeing a Breakout SPX6900 ($SPX) is a meme coin with a serious edge. Despite its playful branding, this token has carved out a niche as a blockchain cryptography leader with scientific applications. Trading at $0.7342, SPX has increased by 3.7% in the past 24 hours and 10.61% over the last week. Here’s the exciting part: SPX is currently consolidating within a bullish pennant pattern. Analysts believe this setup could trigger a breakout, propelling the price past key resistance levels and potentially sparking a rally toward $2. For traders who love to bet on technical setups, SPX6900 offers a compelling opportunity. Could SPX be the meme coin sleeper hit of 2025? Its strong momentum and innovative positioning suggest it has what it takes to be one of the best meme coins to invest. The Bottom Line Based on our research and market trends, crypto’s meme coin market is full of surprises, and 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal year. Popcat’s viral charm, SPX6900’s bullish technicals, and BTFD Coin’s presale success all point to significant opportunities for growth.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) says a new rule will force large banks to either limit overdraft fees to $5, align them to actual costs and losses, or treat overdraft loans like other credit products. That would mean the banks have to disclose interest rates, provide account-opening disclosures, and give consumers the choice to opt in or out. With typical overdraft fees currently clocking in at around $35, the CFPB says the rule will save customers $5 billion annually. Says CFPB Director Rohit Chopra, “For far too long, the largest banks have exploited a legal loophole that has drained billions of dollars from Americans’ deposit accounts. The CFPB is cracking down on these excessive junk fees and requiring big banks to come clean about the interest rate they’re charging on overdraft loans.” The new rule applies to banks and credit unions with at least $10 billion in assets, and is set to take effect on October 1st of 2025. Bank lobbying groups have warned the rule would impact their ability to provide overdraft services to customers, potentially forcing people to use more expensive alternatives such as payday loans.

Now is the time to concentrate on coins with significant potential expansion as the bull market gets fully active. Investing $350 strategically in the correct tokens— Rexas Finance , Tron, Stellar, Mantle, Fantom, Immutable, Sei, and Ondo—you may see your investment rise to an incredible $700,000. These eight tokens are set for extraordinary profits; each is vital for the next wave of blockchain innovation. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Real Estate Tokenization Leader Set to Disrupt Traditional Markets With their innovative approach to real estate tokenization, Rexas Finance (RXS) is creating waves in the cryptocurrency scene. Standing at $0.15 in its Stage 10 presale, Rexas Finance has already generated notable interest in the investment world by raising more than $26.37 million and selling over 335 million tokens. By integrating real estate assets into the blockchain, the project is transforming the real estate industry by enabling fractional ownership and boosting liquidity in a typically illiquid market. Rexas Finance's emphasis on tokenizing real estate presents a rare chance for smaller investors to engage in high-value real estate markets, a privilege once only accessible to the rich. Rexas Finance is fast rising to pioneer blockchain-based real estate solutions. With a potential pricing structure of $0.20, the project poses a unique opportunity to investors looking to capitalize on the following cryptocurrency movement due to its possible increasing value. Tron (TRX): Transforming the Internet and Building the Future of Digital Economy Through its decentralized network, Tron, priced at $0.30 as of writing, is changing digital content and commerce. Utilizing a distributed internet, Tron's goal of building a peer-to-peer digital entertainment ecosystem releases consumers from conventional intermediaries like content platforms. While Tron's purchase of BitTorrent has improved its file-sharing and content distribution capacities, the low fees and scalability of the project have made it a go-to platform for developers wishing to create distributed apps (dApps). Tron's value proposition is clear: it lets creators monetize their work without depending on centralized platforms by enabling flawless content production and delivery. Tron's emphasis on decentralizing the internet helps the internet succeed as the demand for decentralized digital environments keeps increasing. Given the growing acceptance of the network and the growing ecosystem, Tron is an excellent token for anybody looking for significant returns in the digital economy. Stellar (XLM): Empowering Cross-Border Payments with Low-Cost Solutions Long a proponent of financial inclusion, Stellar makes quick and reasonably priced cross-border payments possible Priced around $0.45 as of writing, Stellar's open-source distributed ledger technology appeals to companies and people since it lets users transmit money across borders with few expenses.

Offering scalability and efficiency that distinguish it from other blockchain systems, Stellar is well-suited for managing large-volume transactions. Additionally, it provides better security and openness in asset dealing through its dispersed exchange (DEX). Stellar's importance in worldwide payments will rise as more financial institutions use blockchain technology to simplify their operations, defining it as a major participant in future finance. Mantle Network (MNT): A Scalable Layer 2 Solution for Ethereum Mantle Network (MNT) is a creative Layer 2 solution for Ethereum, designed to improve its scalability without compromising its distributed character. Pricing at $1.17 for writing, Mantle offers a modular architecture that separates transaction execution, data availability, and finality.

Mantle's Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility guarantees that developers may keep expanding on Ethereum's infrastructure while savoring better performance and reduced costs. Mantle provides a vital answer for developers wishing to create decentralized apps (dApps) on a more affordable and efficient platform, as Ethereum's scalability issues restrict its expansion. Ethereum is still the leading blockchain for smart contracts, so Mantle's capacity to offer a scalable solution sets it for significant expansion in importance. Those seeking exposure to the Ethereum ecosystem should give Mantle top significance in the forthcoming crypto explosion. Fantom (FTM): Combining Speed, Security, and Scalability for DeFi Innovation At $1.25 as of writing, Fantom is an open-source blockchain system meant to solve scalability issues that many blockchain systems run across. Fantom is a perfect fit for distributed finance (DeFi) applications and other blockchain-based solutions that demand quick transaction processing. Its unique Lachesis consensus mechanism enables low-cost, high-speed transactions. The cross-chain compatibility and interoperability of Fantom help distributed applications interact flawlessly over several blockchain environments. Fantom's capacity to handle a broad range of decentralized apps in a rapid and safe environment sets it as a top rival in the blockchain scene as the need for DeFi platforms rises. Based on its focus on low-cost transactions and scalability, Fantom is poised to become a top alternative for DeFi developers and investors. Immutable (IMX): Zero Gas Fees for NFTs on Ethereum’s Layer 2 Using its Layer 2 scaling approach on Ethereum, Immutable is transforming the NFT business. Priced at $1.93 as of writing, Immutable X gives creators and collectors a flawless experience by letting users mint, trade, and collect NFTs free from gas expenses. Immutable X guarantees rapid and effective processing of all transactions using ZK-Rollups, therefore preserving Ethereum blockchain security. Immutable's concentration on NFTs is strengthened even more by its cooperation with big businesses and platforms, which makes it the preferred choice for scalable NFT markets and gaming uses. Immutable X is ready for explosive expansion as the NFT industry keeps growing and presents a special chance for investors to profit from the rising market for digital collectibles. Sei (SEI): A Blockchain Built for High-Speed Trading Designed especially to meet trade needs, Sei is a Layer 1 blockchain with low-latency and high-throughput solutions for distributed exchanges (DEXs). Priced at $0.63 as of writing, Sei maximizes the blockchain for rapid order execution and high-frequency trading, thereby enabling customers to trade assets with little delay. Its tailored design fits the decentralized finance (DeFi) environment perfectly since successful transactions depend on speed and dependability. Sei's strategic focus on the trading industry covers the particular needs of DEXs, which are fast becoming increasingly popular as customers search for more asset control. Sei's infrastructure will become more valuable as decentralized exchanges continue to rule the market, therefore preparing it for notable expansion in the next few years. Ondo (ONDO): Tokenizing Real-World Assets for the Masses Ondo is leading the way in tokenizing real-world assets, opening investment possibilities in conventional industries, including commodities and real estate, to be more easily available to regular investors. Offering a fresh approach to engaging with financial markets, Ondo, priced at $1.60 as of writing, lets users invest in tokenized items. Ondo is closing the distance between conventional and distributed finance (DeFi) by digitizing real estate. Ondo's institutional-grade solutions are meant to offer tokenized real estate, commodities, and other traditional assets to a wider audience, thereby allowing small investors to engage in markets long reserved for big corporations. Ondo is positioned to profit from the growing demand for tokenized assets since it presents numerous possibilities for future expansion.

Ahead of ringing the exchange's opening bell, Trump was recognized by TIME magazine as its Person of the Year. ""I think we're going to have a tremendous run. We have to straighten out some problems, some big problems in the world,"" Trump said in an address before ringing the bell. ""When we left, we didn't have any of these problems, we didn't have Russia with Ukraine, we didn't have Israel October 7, we didn't have the Afghanistan disaster, we didn't have inflation. We had no inflation, and we had a very strong economy. And we're going to do that again, but I think we're going to even up it because now we have experience that we didn't have,"" the former President added. Trump said that he believed the ""power of weaponry"" was the biggest threat facing the U.S. at the moment. He also doubled down on his plan to cut taxes after he takes over. ""We're going to give tremendous incentive like no other country has. We're cutting your taxes, we're going to cut them very substantially. We got them down to 21%...now we're getting them down to 15%, but only if you make your product here,"" Trump said. He also touted his administration's proposal to expedite approvals for manufacturers investing at least $1B at home. After the address, the President-elect rang the New York Stock Exchange's opening bell to cheers of ""U.S.A."" Afterward, he was asked by CNBC's Jim Cramer ""what do you have to say to the American investor in this country?"" ""I think you're going to see some very good days ahead, a lot of incentives are going to be given,"" Trump said. ""I've always said, to me, stock market is very all of it, all of it together, it's very important,"" he added. He also touched upon cryptocurrencies with his remark about doing ""something great."" Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and crypto in general have been major beneficiaries of the ""Trump trade"" since the former President's election win. ""We're going to do something great with crypto because we don't want China or anybody else, not just China, but others are embracing it, and we want to be the head,"" Trump told CNBC's Cramer. The President-elect also brought up artificial intelligence: ""We're going to be ahead of AI, we're going to be way ahead of AI, and we're going to produce tremendous amounts of electricity. It's unbelievable when you think that we need more than twice what we already have."" Additionally, Trump said Meta Platforms ( META ) top boss Mark Zuckerberg had been over to see him, and so had Tesla ( TSLA ) chief executive Elon Musk.

Notably, these products are designed to offer investors direct exposure to two of the most important protocols within the Ethereum ecosystem, Lido DAO and Optimism, focused on improving the scalability and efficiency of the network. Grayscale will offer investors products providing exposure to the governance tokens of Lido DAO, LDO, and Optimism Protocol, OP. Both tokens offer solutions to expand and improve the Ethereum ecosystem. Optimism, an L2 blockchain, can help scale Ethereum by reducing congestion on the network, offering users cheaper and more efficient transactions. While, Lido, a liquid staking solution, can help secure the Ethereum network and allow the growth of DeFi. Grayscale’s Head of Product and Research, Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, noted that Lido can help to democratize staking on Ethereum, while optimism is critical in allowing Ethereum to scale and compete with newer and faster L1 blockchains. “Grayscale Lido DAO Trust and Grayscale Optimism Trust provide investors with exposure to protocols helping to increase Ethereum’s efficiency, security, scalability, and adoption within the broader DeFi ecosystem – playing a critical role in the Ethereum story,” he added. The Trusts are now open for daily subscription by eligible individual and institutional accredited investors. The Trusts function like Grayscale’s existing suite of single-asset investment trusts, and solely invest in the token underpinning the Lido protocol (LDO) and the Optimism protocol (OP). The products are available to accredited investors, both individual and institutional, and operate similar to other single-asset investment funds offered by Grayscale, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum funds. With this move, Grayscale aims to strengthen its presence in the crypto market and the DeFi sector, capitalizing on the rising demand for technological solutions that improve Ethereum’s performance and accessibility.",POSITIVE,LDO,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | LDO | OP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/grayscale-launches-investment-products-for-lido-dao-and-optimism/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37555747,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=312551,1734032474,Financial Giant BlackRock Endorses Up to 2% Bitcoin (BTC) Allocation in Multi-Asset Portfolios: Report,"Asset management giant BlackRock is reportedly promoting Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a part of a balanced portfolio. According to a new report by Bloomberg, BlackRock – which has over $10 trillion in assets under its management – released a new research paper saying that a 2% allocation of the top crypto asset by market cap in multi-asset portfolios is “reasonable.” Furthermore, BlackRock says investors weighing their portfolios with 1% or 2% BTC would “produce a similar risk profile to the so-called Magnificent Seven technology stocks in a standard 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds.” However, the asset management firm also warns that portfolios with over 2% of the crypto king would “sharply increase” their risk. As stated by Samara Cowen and the paper’s other authors, according to Bloomberg, “Even though Bitcoin’s correlation to other assets is relatively low, it’s more volatile, making its effect on total risk contribution similar overall. A Bitcoin allocation would have the advantage of providing a diverse source of risk, while an overweight to the Magnificent 7 would add to existing risk and to portfolio concentration.” The Magnificent Seven includes tech giants that have seen massive gains over the last decade, including Google, Amazon, Tesla, Microsoft, and Nvidia. According to the paper’s authors, Bitcoin will eventually become less volatile once blue-chip institutions adopt it. However, this could also slow down its explosive upswings. “Looking ahead, should Bitcoin indeed achieve broad adoption, it could potentially also become less risky – but at that point it might no longer have a structural catalyst for further sizable price increases.” Bitcoin is trading for $101,573 at time of writing, a 1.1% decrease during the last day.

Following the latest series of mints, BTC traded at $101,604.93. The Tether Treasury wallet can take up to 24 hours to inject the next 1B tokens into the market. The latest mint was split between exchanges, including Binance, Kraken, and Bitfinex. The latest mint is not yet moving. The Treasury holds a remainder of 615M USDT, ready to be deployed to exchanges. The new USDT on the market also moves through market makers Cumberland and Abraxis. Wintermute has also boosted USDT activity on Binance, as the exchange has absorbed significant deposits. The rapid series of mints once again raised questions about the sustainability of the BTC rally. However, the active turnover of all available USDT suggests there is not nearly enough USDT to sustain the current trading volumes. Some of the available USDT is also locked in liquidity pools or in staking, or held in personal wallets. USDT grows its influence on crypto trading with high daily turnover After the latest mint, Ethereum carries 79.86B USDT, while TRON remains with 61.85B. The remainder is spread across smaller networks, including Solana, Aptos, TON, and others. In total, 139.74B USDT has entered the market, with a daily turnover volume of $177B. The recent USDT inflows have their effect amplified through high-volume trading. With the latest series of mints, Ethereum remains the undoubted leader in carrying stablecoins. After the latest mints, the Tether token contract burned more than 7.17% of Ethereum gas. USDT was also the fastest-expanding stablecoin in the past month, adding more than 12% to its supply. The latest mints show a pivot from TRON-based USDT into a much bigger influence and activity levels for the Ethereum version. Even with the increased supply, all USDT had a turnover of more than 126%, far surpassing the activity of USDC. Only about 26% of the supply of USDC is traded each day, despite the wide representation of the token. The overall boost to stablecoins also means USDC is becoming more active. While its mints are still slower, a recent transaction moved 1B USDC to an unknown address, revealing the scale of whale liquidity available on the market. The growing supply of USDT coincided with another trend – the phasing out of First Digital USD. FDUSD decreased its supply to just $1.7B, while retaining its relatively high turnover. The activity of FDUSD boosted BTC above $60,000 and contributed to the latest rally above $100,000. However, the most recent market effects may be due to the added ERC-20 USDT tokens. Currently, FDUSD trades 470% of its supply each day, with most activity concentrated on Binance. Stablecoins have grown their influence as a payment tool, going beyond their role for short-term rallies. After the latest mints, the total supply of stablecoins is now above 194.8B. Stablecoins use more than 28.8M daily active addresses, with activity ranging from microtransactions to whale-sized token movements.

Crypto Whale Dumps $95.5M on Coinbase appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP, the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is continuously making waves following whale interest and its impressive performance. However, recent whale activity appears to be a cause for concern for XRP holders, as crypto whales have reportedly dumped nearly a hundred million dollars worth of XRP tokens onto the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange. XRP Whale Dumps $95.5 Million in Tokens On December 13, 2024, the blockchain-based transaction tracker Whale Alert posted on X (formerly Twitter) that 39.43 million XRP tokens worth $95.5 million were transferred from an unknown wallet to Coinbase. 39,430,019 #XRP (95,502,372 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Coinbase https://t.co/UfflvIjbDL — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) December 12, 2024 This whale activity indicates a bearish signal, even as sentiment around XRP appears bullish. Additionally, it raises the question of whether this whale knows something about XRP that suggests its price is poised for a decline. $55 Million of XRP Outflows This transaction seems to refuse the on-chain metrics, which currently appear bullish. According to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass , XRP’s spot inflow/outflow data reveals that exchanges are continuously witnessing significant outflows. This indicates a potential upside rally and further hints at ideal buying opportunities. Source: Coinglass Based on the data, exchanges have witnessed a significant $55 million XRP outflow in the past 48 hours, suggesting strong interest and confidence from long-term holders. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, XRP has been trading in a pattern of lower highs and lower lows since the beginning of December 2024. However, it is currently consolidating near the lower high boundary. This price consolidation suggests that XRP’s bearish trend may soon come to an end, paving the way for a potential bull run. Source: Trading View Based on technical analysis, if XRP breaks out of the consolidation zone and closes a four-hour candle above the $2.50 level, there is a strong possibility it could rise by 15% to reach the $2.90 level in the coming days. Conversely, if XRP breaks down from the consolidation zone and closes a four-hour candle below the $2.30 level, it could decline by 15% to reach the $2.00 level in the near future. Current Price Momentum Currently, XRP is trading near $2.42 and hasn’t experienced any price changes in the last 24 hours.

The round is led by HSG (HongShan Capital Group) and Peak XV Partners. A number of high-profile angels, partners of DST Global and Goodwater Capital also joined the round. Raagulan Pathy, co-founder of KAST, said, “For most countries and over half of global GDP, banking does not match the openness and speed of the internet – it’s fundamentally broken. “Stablecoins are the clear solution, but the user experience wasn’t great. We are building KAST to change this.” Pathy is a stablecoin expert, formerly the vice president for Asia Pacific and CEO for Singapore at Circle, best known for USDC. KAST offers payment cards and USD-denominated accounts to people in over 150 countries, the ability to receive and send cash and working with partners such as Bridge, recently acquired by Stripe. KAST will soon launch savings and other remittance products – all without the need to touch fiat directly. The maturing of stablecoin regulation and acceptance has led to rapid integration with TradFi (traditional finance) networks, enabling users to send money faster, cheaper and more securely. KAST highlighted use cases such as holding USD stablecoins as an alternative to volatile currencies, enabling people to buy imports and travel with a card and allowing remote workers globally to get paid. Daniel Bertoli, co-founder of KAST and former partner at Quona Capital, a global FinTech fund that focuses on investments in neobanks, said, “The next generation of neobanks will be built on stablecoins and inherently global by DNA. “They will differ fundamentally from the current generation of neobanks, which are limited in countries due to licensing and struggle in integrating blockchain – their core systems and capabilities are just too different.” KAST has completed a $10 million seed funding round at an undisclosed valuation. Within its first four months, the company has demonstrated strong early traction in terms of user adoption and revenue. The team views this as a reflection of significant global interest in its platform. Stablecoins have experienced remarkable growth with over $170 billion in supply and $8.5 trillion transaction volume in Q2 2024 by over 125 million users. Analysts predict by 2030 – user numbers will exceed one billion and supply will surpass $1 trillion. Alex Svanevik, CEO and co-founder of Nansen.ai, an early investor in KAST, said, “KAST delivers real benefits to global users. Their USD-denominated accounts provide a safe haven for hard-earned income when local currencies decline, especially for those without access to traditional US accounts. “As more digital nomads receive salaries in stablecoins, they can now bypass the hassle of legacy rails. “International transfers that once took weeks can now be completed instantly and at virtually no cost.” Users can visit the KAST website to learn more about KAST and discover how their innovative offerings can transform financial experience. Testimonials from card users @Mardeni01 said , “I spent two weeks at the bank trying to open a simple savings account. They asked for more than 10 documents ([approximately] 100 papers) and had to sign and stamp each of them. “And I opened a crypto card @KAST_official in literally [two minutes]. “Why would anyone go after traditional cards anymore? If I don’t need my bank statements for embassies, I would always use crypto cards like @KAST_official.” @Alpha69Bets said , “One tap to solve all my issues. That’s all it took when I got my KAST card. Here’s a quick recap – I’ve been traveling a lot lately, and exchanging money has always been a hassle. “You usually end up losing five to eight percent in the process by the time the cash is in your hand. “A friend of mine sent me a link and said, ‘Give this a try!’ Fast forward two months, and I’ve been tapping away quite a lot. “Thanks to @KAST_official … I’ve used it across five countries over the last couple of months without any issues. It’s made international spending and crypto usage incredibly simple.” @Alexspoof said , “I just used my @KAST_official card to pay for my project’s domain name, and it worked seamlessly. “All I had to do was fund it with Solana USDC. This is actually a game-changer for me and any other thing I’ll want to do with it.” About KAST KAST is transforming the financial technology landscape by offering a seamless blend of stablecoin technology with traditional payment means. The KAST platform enables USD accounts globally to over 150 countries, reaching over five billion people – offering a solution where banking falls short. The silky-smooth user experience is taking mainstream the openness, speed and security of stablecoins. KAST enables users to send, receive, save and spend funds across borders efficiently.

The possible appointment could signal a significant pivot toward a more crypto-friendly regulatory approach. Quintenz, a Republican-appointed CFTC commissioner from 2017 to 2021, has been very vocal about fostering innovation in the financial markets, especially regarding digital asset derivatives. He championed regulatory frameworks during his time that balanced technological advancement with market integrity. Bridging Traditional Finance and Crypto At a16z, Quintenz brings his wealth of experience to bear in championing regulations that allow innovation in blockchain while protecting investors. His unique background in traditional finance and cryptocurrency regulation places him in a great position to address the ongoing debates around digital asset oversight. Quintenz’s approach emphasizes regulatory clarity. He has previously supported the integration of Ether futures into the regulatory fold-a move that showed his commitment to fostering market transparency and growth. Criticism of SEC’s Stance on Crypto Quintenz has not been shy about criticizing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In March, he criticized the SEC’s inconsistent stance on Ether, citing its earlier recognition of Ether as a non-security when it approved Ether futures ETFs. He said this inconsistency undermined regulatory clarity and stifled innovation. Following the October approval of spot Ether ETFs, record inflows poured in, culminating in a record single day in December in which $431.5 million was invested. In Quintenz’s view is an excellent illustration of bridging the regulatory gaps the agencies will be facing, in particular from the SEC and CFTC. Pro-Crypto Outlook for the Trump Administration The potential appointment also falls in line with a16z’s bullish outlook on the incoming administration. The venture capital firm said it anticipates the Trump administration will enact policies that will give “greater flexibility to experiment” with blockchain and crypto technologies. A16z has been among the leading voices in the crypto sector, backing major projects like Maker, Solana, and Coinbase. With Quintenz at the helm of the CFTC, the firm’s vision of a more accommodating regulatory environment could gain momentum and spread throughout the crypto industry. Her appointment as chair of the CFTC would mean a change toward pro-crypto regulations and afford the digital asset sector an opportunity to bloom under clear and consistent policy.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/brian-quintenz-trumps-top-pick-for-cftc-signals/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

37555431,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=312546,1734031857,Dentity Acquires Trinsic’s Decentralized ID Platform To Expand Adoption of Web 3.0 Digital Identities,"December 12, 2024 – Santa Monica, California The deal brings together industry leaders and sets the stage for the next era of decentralized digital identity. Dentity is proud to announce the acquisition of Trinsic ’s decentralized identity assets, setting the stage for a dramatic expansion of Web 3.0 identity solutions. These assets represent advanced decentralized identity infrastructure in the world, having enabled thousands of developers to build user-controlled identity features into their applications. With this move, Dentity aims to strengthen its position as a global leader in decentralized identity. Jeff Schwartz, founder and CEO of Dentity, said, “Trinsic’s platform revolutionizes how consumers control and share their personal data. “This acquisition brings us one step closer to creating a safer, more secure digital future, where individuals are fully in charge of their identity – and can potentially earn from it – not ‘Big Tech.'” Riley Hughes, co-founder of Trinsic, said, “Dentity stands out as the most successful product built on our decentralized identity platform. “Their consumer scale and impressive ecosystem of partners will allow Trinsic’s technology to touch millions more, making Dentity the perfect place for this platform to reach its potential.” Dentity has joined Trinsic’s identity acceptance network, which enables seamless identity verification through digital IDs in Web 3.0 wallets like Dentity, mobile drivers licenses and eID apps. Trinsic’s network gives 100 million consumers instant access to Dentity’s products and ecosystem partners. The need for digital identity In a world where fraud, online scams and identity theft are on the rise, digital identity offers a powerful solution. In fact, online grooming crimes have surged 89%, and romance scams are up 160%. This explosion of fraud highlights a major challenge – anonymity online is both a tool for bad actors and a barrier to trust. Decentralized identity is the key to unlocking trust online. It empowers consumers to securely share only what’s necessary, whether they’re buying, selling, dating or participating in the growing Web 3.0 economy. For the first time, individuals – not third parties – control their data, cutting out the middlemen who earns from consumer information. The timing Consumers are increasingly dissatisfied with how their data is controlled by large tech companies. Over 75% of people don’t trust Big Tech with their personal information, and they’re demanding more control over their digital lives. Gartner predicts that by 2026, 500 million smartphone users will regularly use a digital identity wallet – a testament to the growing need for decentralized digital identity solutions. Combining Trinsic’s powerful identity technology with Dentity’s consumer apps and distribution channels accelerates the adoption of reusable, verified digital identities – helping to combat fraud, streamline online interactions and give users the tools to manage their data. Schwartz added, “The convergence of rising online fraud and consumer demand for more privacy-driven solutions makes this the perfect time for Dentity to scale.” A multi-billion dollar opportunity The market for digital identity is projected to reach $325 billion by 2027, and with this acquisition, Dentity is uniquely positioned to capture its share. The acquisition not only unlocks new growth opportunities but also helps Dentity and its partners scale faster and reach a wider range of developers looking to integrate decentralized identity into their platforms. Schwartz also said, “The future of Web 3.0 and digital identity is about empowering individuals, reducing online fraud and making the internet a more trustworthy place. “We’re building a future where digital trust is easy, secure and owned by the individual.” About Dentity Dentity makes it easy for people to build and manage digital trust online. They empower individuals to create, control and verify their identity credentials, allowing them to securely share private data with the people and organizations they interact with. Dentity powers one of the world’s most advanced decentralized identity infrastructure, enabling thousands of developers to integrate user-controlled identity features into their applications. Dentity gives millions of consumers full ownership and control over their digital identities. Users can visit the website for more information. About Trinsic Trinsic is the first identity acceptance network, facilitating 10 times faster identity verification for 95 million consumers. Its product acts as a gateway into dozens of identity networks, mobile drivers licenses and eID apps. Companies use Trinsic to check for a digital ID before asking users to upload a physical ID document for verification. Since founding in 2019, Trinsic has raised $9.4 million from Georgian, Kickstart Seed Fund, Osage Venture Partners and notable angel investors from the identity space.

Pepe Loves Santa (PEPESAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Loves Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Loves Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Loves Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Loves Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Loves Santa by entering its contract address – 9FuN9o4pQgF3NF1v2saWvb7b9hNKDJ1DGU6LSbur437Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESAN.

42373596,0a774b3c-ac0c-4039-b7ee-0ab88c9b07ca,1734031436,Memecoins Are Not Easy Money,"Memecoins, whether people want to accept it or not, have become big business. Without delving into statistics, anyone immersed in the crypto space this year can confirm that memecoins have dominated conversations. Critics often argue that memecoins are just a rehash of Jordan Belfort’s “Wolf of Wall Street” era — a world of unregulated securities and insider trading. This time, however, the penny stocks have been replaced by on-chain memes financialized in ways that make it seem like anyone can create and profit from them.  Yet, this perception of memecoins as a quick, easy way to win a digital lottery and become an overnight millionaire is deeply flawed. While they may be marketed as accessible and egalitarian, the reality is far more complex.   Memecoins thrive not only on mechanics but also on culture. They tap into internet humor, FOMO, and the gamified thrill of financial speculation—making them as much about community as profit. As Kelvin Sparks Jr., a Research Analyst at The Block who focuses on memecoins, explains, ""The absurdity of someone’s path to generational wealth through the likes of a vehicle like Dogecoin is becoming more of an aspiration for Gen-z and late millennials who are boxed out of other investment vehicles. They want to own the culturally relevant lottery ticket and by choosing to spend income and energy on these seemingly silly things are actually making a powerful statement. This statement is countercultural, it is signaling a movement bigger than meme stocks and Occupy Wall St. Currently the Memecoin market cap is around $140 billion at the time of writing, and my guess is that number will be larger a year from now.""  Successfully launching a memecoin requires significant capital, a methodical approach, and often, insider connections. The truth is, many of these projects, which present themselves as grassroots or community-driven, are nothing more than anonymous pyramid schemes in disguise. If people understood the actual mechanics behind their success, they’d realize how inaccessible and orchestrated this supposedly “easy” path truly is. While not all memecoins are scams in disguise, it’s crucial to recognize the risks and realities involved, as this is an ecosystem where real money is at stake.  While memecoins are often perceived as simple and accessible, their success is anything but accidental. Behind every viral token lies a calculated process involving key players, strategic funding, and carefully timed launches. This is where the business of memecoins begins to resemble a finely tuned machine, one that depends on a blend of market psychology, tokenomics, and influential endorsements to create momentum.  If that still sounds too conspiratorial, let’s walk through the steps required to successfully launch a memecoin. Then you can decide for yourselves.  The vision thing  First, you need a meme idea with the potential to generate real buzz. While bringing on an influencer with a big brand might seem like a shortcut, history shows it’s rarely a guaranteed strategy. For instance, the recent Hailey Welch token faced massive scrutiny on crypto Twitter for allegedly being a ""rug pull."" Whether these accusations hold true remains to be seen, but the controversy alone casts a shadow over the future of celebrity-endorsed memecoins.  After you’ve got the meme idea, it’s time to set the mission and vision. This is where the most critical work begins. You need to develop your tokenomics and outline them in a lite-paper to share with initial investors. This raises essential questions: Which blockchain will you launch on? What will the total token supply be? How soon after the Token Generation Event (TGE) will tokens enter circulation? How will community fund allocations reward early supporters for belief propagation and social mining? What portion will go to private presales, public allocations, team allocations, and treasury reserves? How will the token be priced, and what vesting schedules will be implemented for everyone involved?  If this already seems complex, understand, this is just the beginning. Understanding these mechanics is crucial, as they reveal how the deck is often stacked in favor of insiders, leaving naive investors holding the bag when hype fizzles out.  Why does all this matter? Well, if memecoins are a business like we’ve agreed to, then it will take initial capital investment to turn the idea into more money. And if you want to launch a billion dollar enterprise when it comes to a memecoin, or anything for that matter, it will take some serious initial investment.  Now the work  Once funds are raised, it’s time to start putting them to work. Naturally, the team responsible for all this effort needs to be compensated — after all, most people can’t pay for their food with future token supplies. Treasury reserves are then allocated to ecosystem expansion, infrastructure, and technology development. Liquidity provisioning is another crucial step. Locked liquidity on platforms like Meteora, Jupiter, and Radium ensures smooth trading, specifically if you’re launching on Solana.  Beyond technical requirements, some memecoins organize real-life gatherings, conferences, and charity events to strengthen community bonds. Community members who contribute significantly often receive monetary rewards or token allocations. Finally, if you aim to list on major centralized exchanges, allocating tokens specifically for exchange listings becomes an absolute necessity since that’s where consumer user liquidity lives.  An unspoken rule in the world of memecoins is the pivotal role of Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs). These influencers are often integral to a token's success, but their involvement is far from impartial. In many cases, KOLs are early investors, acquiring tokens at a fraction of the eventual launch price. By the time the token hits the market, they’ve already made substantial returns. In other cases, tokens are gifted directly to their wallets, further aligning their interests with the token's success.  Why are KOLs so critical? In a decentralized ecosystem, many rely on influencers to spotlight promising tokens, assuming these figures are unbiased experts or visionaries. The reality is far more calculated: KOLs are often incentivized — financially or otherwise — to promote specific tokens, driving hype and adoption. So, the next time a KOL boasts about identifying a memecoin at its early stages, consider that they were likely paid to do so, conveniently omitting the many tokens they’ve promoted that went nowhere.  A note to add is that KOLs can often be used for what you’d call the “cold start problem”, meaning you want to create a positively reinforcing cycle where tokens are used by the team for different forms of marketing. This marketing takes the shape of grants, non-financial incentives using status with things like displaying certain PFPs, or finding ways to increase profits for holders in the community driving the price up. In an ideal world, a meme plus the word of mouth marketing begets a flywheel that brings in a larger community to scale it. There absolutely have been cases where it was done organically, but striking lighting in a bottle multiple times is no easy feat.  Inherent tension  This insider-driven approach creates a stark tension with the ethos of decentralization, which is meant to empower communities over personalities. The reliance on influencer-driven practices highlights an uncomfortable reality: in many cases, the cult of personality undermines the principles of equity and transparency that crypto is supposed to champion. Though many memecoins are orchestrated ventures, some do achieve success through genuine community engagement and shared enthusiasm, proving that not every project is purely cynical.  The moral or ethical lens of whether memecoins represent a form of financial nihilism is worth considering. But more importantly, people investing their hard-earned money into these digital lotteries need a clearer understanding of what they’re entering into.  None of this is to say there’s no money to be made in memecoins — after all, even the worst pyramid schemes have winners. Some memecoin creators will raise massive sums of money, using it wisely over the years without giving up equity. Savvy investors may also sit on large profits. However, success hinges on understanding the game. The crypto mantra ""Do Your Own Research"" (DYOR) is key, and knowing the real mechanics behind memecoin launches equips you to better protect yourself and approach these investments smartly.  If you’re still intrigued by memecoins after reading this, that’s great. The goal here wasn’t to add to the moralizing or intellectual debates already surrounding them. Instead, it was to shed light on the reality: while it’s entirely possible to turn $1,000 into $100,000 with memecoins in a short time, it’s far from as simple as the Internet might have you believe.  Understanding the mechanics behind this multi-billion-dollar industry is essential if you want to navigate it intelligently — and only then can you truly find a way to “enter the ring.” In a space where memes have become big business, knowledge is your best defense. Only by understanding the mechanics can you hope to navigate this ecosystem intelligently and, perhaps, turn the odds in your favor.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,Azeem Khan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/12/memecoins-are-not-easy-money,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8431b3794d1831e4f4cf4e56a1942c5c6392882b-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

37554970,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=312537,1734030875,Karrier One Launches Decentralized WiFi Hotspot Devices on Sui Network To Expand Global Connectivity,"December 12, 2024 – Florida, United States Karrier One , a DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure network) built on the Sui Network, is excited to announce the worldwide launch of its innovative WiFi hotspot devices.

This suggests another potential major shift in the United States’ crypto regulatory landscape. From CFTC to a16z Based on Quintenz’s pedigree and Donald Trump’s pro-crypto agenda , the president-elect may be on the right path to positioning America’s crypto industry. Before moving to the venture capital behemoth, Andreessen Horowitz, the financial manager, served as a commissioner with the CFTC for four years. He was one of those who supervised the launch of the first regulated futures contracts for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Georgia University graduate also promoted discussions around Decentralized Finance (DeFi). In his current role, Quintenz oversees the crypto division at a16z as a policy head. He boasts a huge wealth of experience from the private and public sectors. Quintenz Pushes For Robust Crypto Regulations For a long time, especially under Gary Gensler’s administration, the crypto landscape suffered numerous enforcement actions from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Top cryptocurrency exchanges Binance , Coinbase, Kraken , and Ripple are all victims of the SEC’s perceived hostility toward the crypto industry in America. In his usual outspoken nature, Quintenz consistently reprimanded the agency for its overly restrictive approach. He even pointed out that the crypto landscape needs rules “fit for purpose” to realize its full potential. Once appointed, he could bring the much-anticipated favorable robust crypto regulations to fruition. Quintenz is a Republican Party Member Other potential candidates for the CFTC chair office are current CFTC Commissioners Summer Mersinger and Caroline Pham. Legal experts Joshua Sterling and Neal Kumar are also up for consideration. However, Quintenz has emerged as a frontrunner among all these candidates. Interviews are being concluded, after which the result will eventually be announced. It is worth noting that Brian Quintenz is a core member of the Republican party. While it is not likely that Trump will play the ‘party’ card, being a Republican may be to Quintenz’s advantage. More importantly, his pro-innovation stance complements Trump’s desire to foster a supportive environment for the crypto industry.

37554799,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=312534,1734030605,"Atoma Launches Private, Decentralized AI on Sui","December 12, 2024 – Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands Demos fully private and decentralized AI chat app with performance on par with ChatGPT and Perplexity AI. Sui , the layer-one blockchain that delivers unparalleled scalability and speed, and Atoma Network , a next-generation decentralized AI engine, today announced that Atoma’s fully decentralized AI layer, first announced earlier this year, is live on Sui’s mainnet. The team also offered reporters a first glimpse into the potential of decentralized AI with a decentralized AI chat app – code-named ‘Utopia’ – built on Sui that enables users to have full ownership of their private data while still providing a user experience on par with centralized alternatives. With its integration currently live in its alpha version on Sui’s mainnet, Atoma is actively expanding its decentralized ecosystem with new nodes and application builders. For these developers, building on Atoma is an easy transition because Atoma’s API endpoints are directly analogous to those provided by the OpenAI API, which many of them are already familiar with. Then, with Atoma, they can create personalized applications like chatbots connected to social media, finances or health applications that still maintain individuals’ control over their data. One of the unique strengths of Atoma’s structure is that all of its AI processing occurs in secure areas within a processor – called ‘TEEs’ (trusted execution environments). As a result, AI computations are isolated from the rest of the system, and AI inputs and outputs are fully private and beyond access by AI companies. Unlike centralized AI applications like ChatGPT, Claude or Perplexity, where the companies that created the technology can associate inputs with individual accounts, Atoma protects users with complete privacy and censorship resistance. At the same time, by leveraging one of the world’s fastest blockchains, Atoma can offer a user experience with speed and efficiency on par with the centralized versions. While the AI chat app Atoma created as an initial demonstration represents one application of its technology, Atoma’s infrastructure empowers developers to create private AI agents that perform a multitude of tasks while protecting individual user data. Because the private AI agents on Atoma can access and process personal information without exposing user data, they are ideal for applications that require personalization and confidentiality. For example, Atoma-powered decentralized AI can do the following. In DeFi Manage portfolios, balance assets and mitigate risks automatically Execute trading strategies in real-time on market conditions Interact securely with smart contracts for yield farming, lending and staking In social media Automate content moderation, curation and community management Deliver personalized recommendations for content, connections and ads Verify interactions and maintain user privacy Private AI agents can also provide significant value across areas like personal assistants, shopping, gaming and DeSci (decentralized science). Atoma leverages Sui-related technology platforms to provide its best-in-class service. Atoma relies on the Sui blockchain for settlement, managing payments and validating transactions, building on Sui’s industry-leading sub-second transaction finality, support for high volumes and predictable, low-cost transactions. Atoma also integrates Walrus, a decentralized storage solution built on Sui for fast, secure access to private data. This integration ensures that sensitive information is securely stored and easily accessible, supporting AI models in retrieving external data for context-rich insights. By automatically managing data retrieval during long interactions, Walrus enhances memory, contextual understanding and workflow efficiency, enabling more accurate AI responses. Jorge Antonio, CTO and co-founder at Atoma, said, “Decentralized AI requires a blockchain with high degrees of scalability, lightning fast transaction speeds and low, predictable transaction costs – a nd on these metrics, Sui and Walrus really shine. “Sui and Walrus offer a combination of performance, cost effectiveness, reliability and ease of integration that is unique in our industry, and we are thrilled to build on the foundation they provide.” Jameel Khalfan, head of ecosystem development at the Sui Foundation, said, “AI technology is advancing at an unprecedented pace, transforming industries and reshaping how we interact with the world. “As adoption accelerates, decentralized and scalable solutions will be critical to safeguarding user control over personal information. “Atoma’s work, built on the highly scalable platforms of Sui and Walrus, ensures that users can leverage the transformative power of AI without compromising the security and privacy of their data.” Contact Sui Foundation This content is sponsored and should be regarded as promotional material.

37554644,https://crypto.news/?p=14318728,1734030212,Sequentia co-founder crashed 69% of DOGE nodes by exploiting fatal flaw,"Andreas Kohl, co-founder of the Bitcoin sidechain Sequentia, claimed responsibility for crashing 69% of the Dogecoin network by exploiting a critical vulnerability dubbed “DogeReaper.” On Dec. 12 the Department of DOGE Efficiency, the @EfficiencyDOGE X account that monitors activity on the Dogecoin ( DOGE ) network, reported that a hacker took down nearly 69% of the meme coin network’s nodes. Data from the private blockchain search engine Blockchair revealed that Dogecoin had 647 active nodes before the hack. By the time the vulnerability was discovered and reported by @EfficiencyDOGE, only 205 nodes remained active. At the time of writing, the network had recovered slightly to 373 active nodes. Co-founder of the Bitcoin sidechain Sequentia, Andreas Kohl, claimed he was responsible for the hack on Dogecoin. He said he took down the network using a computer located in El Salvador. “Let the records show that on this day 69% of the Dogecoin network was taken down by a single ThinkPad in rural El Salvador,” wrote Kohl as he quoted the @EffeciencyDOGE post showcasing the crash. Let the records show that on this day 69% of the Dogecoin network was taken down by a single ThinkPad in rural El Salvador. https://t.co/BgJovDsySG — Andreas Kohl (@aejkohl) December 12, 2024 In a separate post , Kohl gave credit to Tobias Ruck, the researcher who discovered the vulnerability on the Dogecoin network which caused the nodes to crash. The vulnerability is called the “DogeReaper” which has the power to take down the entire network if given the chance. The account @EfficiencyDOGE shared a public discclosure post containing a video and detailed instructions on how the critical vulnerability could be exploited. “DogeReaper is a critical vulnerability on Dogecoin, allowing anyone to crash any Dogecoin node remotely,” wrote @EfficiencyDOGE. The account explained that the vulnerability works like the “Death Note” in the popular Japanese manga of the same name. The plot is centered around a cursed notebook where the main character writes down the name of a person and that person immediately dies. You might also like: Here’s why Dogecoin price will rebound, according to experts With “DogeReaper” the concept is very similar, all the hacker has to do is type out the address of the Dogecoin node the hacker wants to crash, and that node will instantly die of a Segmentation Fault. Because the addresses of Dogecoin nodes are public knowledge, the account stated that “anyone could crash the entire Dogecoin network in an instant.” “If a malicious actor would’ve found this bug instead of us, he could have stopped the Dogecoin network for at least a few days, with no transactions or blocks,” said the account. Kohl’s hack apparently had little to no affect on the Dogecoin price. According to data on crypto.news , DOGE has gone up by 3.1% in the past 24 hours of trading with a 24 hour trading volume of $7.3 billion.

Moreover, the account claimed that Tobias Ruck and RoqqitDev had sent multiple disclosures to the network as well as major exchanges to prevent people from exploiting the vulnerability. Upon receiving the information, Binance vowed to fix the vulnerability sometime “this week.” While Coinbase reviewed the report and graded the severity of DogeReaper as “low” before marking the ticket with the status “informative” and granting Ruck $200.

37554492,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=661245,1734030008,Dogecoin Price On Its Way To $1: Why A Retest Of $0.48 Is More Important Than Anything,"The Dogecoin price journey toward the coveted $1 mark has been a topic of interest for crypto enthusiasts and traders alike. Reaching $1 would solidify Dogecoin into a new psychological threshold and into new all-time high prices. However, there have been differing perspectives as to how and when this would happen. A technical analysis on the TradingView platform suggests that the Dogecoin price may encounter resistance at $0.48, experience a decline, and then resume its upward trajectory towards $1 and beyond. Dogecoin Price Could Reject At $0.48 Dogecoin is currently trading below the $0.48 mark, but technical analysis has pointed to a notable resistance situated around this price level. According to the Dogecoin price analysis of the 4-hour candlestick timeframe, the $0.48 price level is one to watch. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Last Phase Of ABC Wave Points To A Bounce To New ATH At $5.85 This is because the Dogecoin price has yet to exhibit a notable break above this price level throughout the current bull market cycle. Particularly, the rally has been highlighted by two rejections just below the $0.48 price level, with the highest Dogecoin price so far being $0.475 on November 23 and December 8. The analyst points out that the Dogecoin price recently experienced a solid bounce from the 200EMA on a 4-hour timeframe. This bounce signifies that the bulls are still in control, as the price continues to show resilience against downward pressure. The confluence of support at the 200EMA with bullish momentum provides a foundation for Dogecoin’s upward movement, setting the stage for the anticipated test of the $0.48 level. Interestingly, Dogecoin’s inability to break above $0.48 yet has seen the price level being regarded as the zone of liquidity. The TradingView analyst emphasizes that this level remains a focal point, predicting that Dogecoin is likely to face another rejection at $0.48. Such a rejection could lead to a pullback deeper than any seen so far during this bull cycle and offer an opportunity for consolidation before attempting a stronger breakout. What Happens After The Retest? According to the analyst, a rejection at the $0.48 price level would see the Dogecoin price falling significantly and erasing most of the gains it piled up in November. Particularly, the analyst envisions a fall to fill the CME on lower zones up to the $0.20 price zone. Such a move is expected to have a devastating effect on the sentiment of bullish investors, specifically those anticipating a quick new Dogecoin price all-time high. Related Reading: Solana Price At $4,000? Cup And Handle Pattern Shows Why This Is Possible Despite this anticipated pullback, the analyst maintains a longer-term bullish outlook. Once Dogecoin reaches the $0.20 zone and completes the consolidation phase, a strong rebound is expected to follow. This rebound is projected to drive the price decisively past the $0.48 resistance and set the stage for Dogecoin’s journey toward the much-anticipated $1 milestone. With this in mind, the analyst highlighted the $0.24 to $0.20 range as the ideal buying zone to best capitalize on this move. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at $0.42 and is up by 7% in the past 24 hours.

37554543,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626702,1734029610,Argentine President Javier Milei promises a Bitcoin-friendly economy and sweeping tax cuts,"Argentina’s president, Javier Milei, is turning the country’s battered economy on its head with straight up the boldest reform agendas in its history. After a year in office, Milei is following through on his promises to dismantle traditional systems, drastically cut taxes, and make Bitcoin a legitimate currency in Argentina by 2025. With a libertarian playbook in hand, the president has slashed 90% of national taxes, opened the door for states to set their own fiscal policies, and announced plans to legalize free currency use as part of his vision to fix decades of economic mismanagement. Milei’s reforms are controversial. He’s firing government workers, gutting public spending, and wiping out subsidies on essentials like transportation, food, and utilities. The results? Inflation has plummeted, poverty has skyrocketed, and Argentina is on the brink of an unprecedented financial experiment. Milei’s tax cuts and Bitcoin vision The proposed tax cuts plan to reduce 90% of the country’s national taxes, giving states the freedom to create their own tax systems. “Happy times are coming,” Milei declared during a recent address, promising “sustained growth” in 2025. As for the crypto connection, it was only a matter of time before he joined his new besties Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump. For a country with a history of hyperinflation and a currency—the peso—that no one trusts, the idea of ditching centralized money resonates with many. Global investors are paying attention. Bank of America praised Milei’s stabilization efforts in a report, calling his policies “better than expected.” However, critics argue that the removal of subsidies and price controls is punishing the poorest Argentines while benefiting international markets. Economic upheaval: Cuts, chaos, and cash Milei’s economic strategy is brutal but effective in tackling Argentina’s inflation problem. Monthly inflation, which stood at 12.8% when he took office, is now down to 2.4%—the lowest in four years. His administration has achieved a budget surplus for the first time in 16 years, cutting government spending by a third and ending monetary issuance. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts inflation will drop to 45% by 2025 from its 2023 high of 211%. But the cost of these victories is shocking. Over five million Argentines have been pushed into poverty since Milei took office, with the poverty rate climbing from 40% to 53% in just six months. Public outrage is growing. Milei’s austerity measures have brought on protests from students, retirees, and workers. University budgets are slashed, pension payments are shrinking, and subsidies on utilities have disappeared. The peso remains volatile despite government controls, and analysts warn that the lack of investment in public services could hurt Argentina’s long-term growth. Milei’s global allies As aforementioned, Milei’s been busy forging alliances with some of the most powerful and intelligent people of our time, like Trump and Elon. Last month, Milei became the first world leader to meet President-elect Trump after his U.S. election victory. The two met at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, where they hung out for hours. While speaking to reporters, Trump praised Milei’s efforts, calling them “incredible.” Milei often draws comparisons to Trump, not just for his policies but also for his brash style and unapologetic attacks on critics. He mocks “woke” culture, dismisses political opponents as “socialists,” and uses social media to amplify his libertarian agenda. “You’re my favorite president,” Trump told Milei on a late-night phone call. This is the bromance mainstream thought the US president had with Russia’s Vlad Putin. Elon, meanwhile, has actually been having dinners and sleepovers with Milei for months, as we’ve reported before. At one point, he said: “Javier has inspired us with his commitment to eliminating bureaucracy. Argentina is practically the last truly liberal country in the world.” At home, though, Milei’s populist style isn’t all that popular. His whole economic overhaul has divided Argentina. Supporters see him as a necessary disruptor who’s finally addressing decades of mismanagement. But for others, the sacrifices are too great. Poverty is rising, public services are deteriorating, and the social fabric of the country is under strain. Consumption of beef—a cultural staple in Argentina—is at its lowest level in 28 years, and many families are cutting back on basics like milk and bread. Despite the hardships, Milei’s approval ratings remain strong, with 56% of Argentines viewing him favorably. His libertarian ideals resonate with those frustrated by corruption and inefficiency in government. But the question remains: how much more can the country endure before the promised “happy times” arrive? One way or another though, looks like Bitcoin is now officially on the ride.

37554392,https://blockworks.co/news/electric-capital-report-solana-developers,1734028879,Solana gained highest share of new devs in 2024: Electric Capital,"If developer mindshare is any indication of innovation, then knowing something about developer activity matters. It’s why the industry pays attention when Electric Capital releases its annual developer report. As of November 2024, crypto had about 23,613 monthly active developers, a sliver (0.0875%) of the 27 million population of global software devs. It’s an impressive 2000% increase over the last decade, but numbers are still down from the industry’s highs of about 31,000 in 2022. One notable trend among crypto developers is the increasingly global distribution of talent today compared to years past. In 2015, 80% of devs worked out of North America and Europe. Today, both continents have seen their share of developers decline to 24% and 31%, respectively, while Asia now leads with 32% of developer mindshare. Read more: The Solana ecosystem has a lot to be thankful for this year The Ethereum Virtual Machine ( EVM ) remains the leading tech stack, boasting a robust network effect with 8,925 developers — roughly 3.6 times the size of the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) stack, which has 2,499 developers. What stands out however, is Solana coming in as the number one ecosystem for new developers over the past year. This is an impressive lead, especially considering that Ethereum — which is a close second in attracting new developers — is bolstered by an ecosystem that includes dozens of layer-2 rollups. Solana developers dominate in India, accounting for approximately 27%. Notably, it is the only country where new developers are joining the Solana ecosystem at a higher rate than they are any other blockchain. India also ranks second in developer share, trailing only the US. Read more: Electric Capital finds veteran Web3 devs are on the rise The highest developer activity doesn’t always directly translate to code innovation. For this reason, the Electric Capital developer report also considered which chains have the most new code written. Ethereum maintains its lead with about 65% of new code written across its layer-1 and layer-2 ecosystems. According to the report, liquidity isn’t the only thing fragmenting in Ethereum — scarce developer talent is too. Since Ethereum adopted its rollup-centric roadmap, the share of developers working on layer-2s has grown from 25% to 56%. Out of all active layer-2s, Base has the largest active developer base of 4,287, followed by Arbitrum (3,450), Starknet (2,548), Optimism (2,416), Scroll (1,517) and zkSync (1,115). If developer activity is any indication of increased chain activity, Starknet’s developer lead is perhaps somewhat surprising, especially in contrast to an older chain like Optimism. Based on transaction count, Starknet’s activity has languished in comparison over the past year. Source: Growthepie What about Bitcoin? The Bitcoin network has about 1,200 monthly active developers; a number that has stayed fairly constant over the last 12 months. Yet with the rise of Bitcoin layer-2s, NFTs and various scaling solutions, at least 42% of bitcoin developers are now dedicating their efforts to those areas.

The financial group, headquartered in Paris, anticipates that the token will be released next year, although it is subject to regulatory approval. The initiative will bring the company into an increasingly crowded market. Stablecoins’ low volatility has made them a popular choice among crypto traders who want to transmit funds between platforms or enter and exit positions. They have also become more beneficial for firms that wish to effectuate faster and more cost-effective digital payments and for investors who wish to trade and settle traditional assets like bonds using blockchain technology. The Oddo BHF SCA stablecoin – Details Reports reveal that Oddo BHF has been collaborating with the crypto technology company Fireblocks to create the instrument. The European Union has adopted the new crypto regulations. The stablecoin is anticipated to be structured under the EU regulations, which will present an opportunity for Oddo to thrive. This project comes as an addition to Societe Generale SA’s crypto assets unit in France, Oddo’s native market. The market has already issued a euro-denominated stablecoin known as EUR convertible. The restructuring was also completed by the EU’s new regulations. Oddo is considered to have the ability to handle the stablecoin as it had approximately 3,000 employees and over €140 billion ($147 billion) in client assets under management at the end of 2023. Last year, it generated net banking income of €806 million (1.02 billion) and is majority-owned by the Oddo family. According to reports, Oddo operates in three primary sectors: Private banking, asset management, and corporate and investment banking. The rise of the stablecoin market Stablecoins are now part of the crypto assets program’s markets, which is anticipated to encourage an increase in activity from banks and other financial institutions. They are intended to maintain a consistent value in relation to an asset such as the dollar or euro and are rapidly becoming more commonplace. Source: DeFiLlama – Through Bloomberg Stripe Inc. announced its intention to acquire Bridge, a startup, in October. Stripe, under the leadership of Chief Executive Officer Patrick Collison, will acquire Bridge for $1.1 billion. In addition, Deutsche Bank AG’s DWS Group, Dutch market creator Flow Traders Ltd., and crypto fund manager Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. have established a new company, AllUnity. The company intends to issue a euro-denominated stablecoin. Also, Robinhood Markets Inc. and Revolut Ltd., two of the most successful fintech startups, are reportedly considering introducing stablecoins. However, reports suggest that promoting several stablecoins has been easy. Market entrants such as PayPal Holdings Inc. have encountered difficulty. According to Coingecko, only six tokens have achieved a market value of over $1 billion. However, Tether’s USDT has not had that problem. Tether’s main instrument stands at $140 billion, having added roughly $20 billion since Donald Trump’s election to the White House in early November.

37553681,https://finbold.com/?p=219072,1734028248,Analyst eyes continuation for the altcoin season after recent correction,"Altcoins recently experienced an overdue correction amid a Bitcoin ( BTC ) rejection of the $100,000 psychological resistance . Yet, the prominent technical analyst CrypNuevo believes the altcoin season is ready for continuation after creating interesting buying opportunities. In a recent post on X, CrypNuevo recalled a previous analysis from one of his videos. Particularly, the analysis predicted Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) to correct from the ongoing drop, temporarily pausing the altcoin season. As warned, this correction would follow a Bitcoin rejection of the $100,000 mark, punishing altcoins with a two-digit crash . The analyst, however, explained he would use this dip to increase his altcoins positions, which happened recently. Now, CrypNuevo forecasts BTC.D will continue its downward movement, fueling another altseason – with smaller-cap cryptocurrencies outperforming the leader. $BTC.D Potential retrace before continuation possibly done. Thanks to understanding a few days ago that BTC.D was going to go up at the same time as BTC would fill the $94k wick, we could anticipate and buy the big discount in altcoins. All according to the plan 🔨😎✍️ pic.twitter.com/zjbQBzvYMy — CrypNuevo 🔨 (@CrypNuevo) December 12, 2024 Altcoins outperform Bitcoin during altseason As of this writing, Bitcoin Dominance is at approximately 56%, dropping from a peak of 61.53%, according to TradingView . This drop happens as some altcoins outperform BTC in different time frames. For example, as observed when analyzed against the following six altcoins: Data Finbold retrieved from TradingView shows XRP , Solana ( SOL ), Cardano ( ADA ), Algorand ( ALGO ), Near ( NEAR ), and MultiversX ( EGLD ) against Bitcoin. In particular, these altcoins saw gains of 318%, 77%, 242%, 255%, 74%, and 89% in the last three months, respectively. On the other hand, BTC had a shy 68.26% gain in the same period, demonstrating what is further expected. BTC vs. SOL, XRP, ADA, ALGO, NEAR, and EGLD. Source: TradingView / Finbold / Vini Barbosa Interestingly, most analysts believe this is just the start of “ the mother of all bull markets ” and “ the biggest crypto bull run ever ,” which is expected to massively favor “utility altcoins” as the “ easiest and surest ” investment plays for 2025. If history repeats, cryptocurrency investors will see money rotating from Bitcoin to large-caps, then mid-caps, and then small-caps over time. The rotation has already started, with coins in the top 50 benefiting the most, as shown with the triple-digit gains. Now, experts await the continuation of this trend, with significant inflows to the top 100 and deeper into small-caps. Featured image from Shutterstock.

Republican State Representative Giovanni Capriglione submitted legislation for Texas to open a strategic Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve that would hold the asset for at least five years. Capriglione’s proposal, filed live during an X Spaces on Dec. 12, argued for collecting donations, taxes, and fees in Bitcoin as a bulwark against U.S. and global inflation.

President-elect Trump promised to retain 100% of America’s 207,000 BTC stockpile at a Bitcoin conference in Nashville. Senator Cynthia Lummis unveiled her bill to accumulate 4% of BTC’s 21 million supply at the same event.

BlackRock said investors could allocate up to 2% to BTC, a move endorsed by Kraken vice president of Institutional Tim Ogilvie per a note shared with crypto.news via email.

37553301,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374436,1734027514,Ethereum Overtakes Tron as the Leading Network for USDT Supply,"Ethereum has emerged as the leading blockchain for Tether’s USDT supply, surpassing Tron in a monumental shift for stablecoin dominance. Over the past month, Tether issued $20 billion in USDT on the network, possibly marking it as the go-to blockchain for activity involving the fiat-pegged cryptocurrency. Strategic Expansion Figures shared by the on-chain data platform Token Terminal show that Tether’s $20 billion issuance on the world’s largest blockchain by total value locked is nearly twice the active loans on protocols like Aave. Additional information from another blockchain analysis platform, Lookonchain, indicates that the surge in USDT minting started on November 6. Since then, Tether has been issuing between $1 billion and $2 billion of stablecoins every few days across Ethereum and Tron, with the former accounting for the lion’s share. The trend is more than just numbers. Some analysts imply it is a nod to the reputation of the platform co-founded by Vitalik Buterin as a “trusted” and socially reputable network—a critical factor for institutional adoption. Furthermore, commentators like DCinvestor on X have suggested that the uptick is just the beginning. They predict that Ethereum’s stablecoin supply could go up exponentially, potentially reaching as high as $1 trillion by the end of 2025. If it became a reality, this growth would represent a massive boost to the network’s overall economy, even cementing its position as the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi). USDT’s Dominance According to DefiLlama data, Tether has continued to expand its issuance, controlling more than 69% of the $201 billion stablecoin market. In Q4 2024, records revealed that about 109 million wallets held the asset, more than double those holding Bitcoin and less than 20 million behind those with Ethereum. Additionally, the issuer registered more than 4.5 billion web hits in the first 9 months of the year, with emerging markets accounting for nearly half that number. With a presence in over 80 blockchain networks, USDT currently has a market cap of $140 billion, up 12.55% in the last month. Its closest competitor, USD Coin (USDC), valued at $41.5 billion, recently entered into a strategic partnership with Binance, seeking to challenge the Tether’s dominance. While details of the collaboration remain scant, it is intended to expand the global adoption of USDC. Binance will incorporate the stablecoin into its full suite of products and services, making it accessible to its 240 million-strong user base. Attempts to reverse USDT’s hegemony aren’t limited to USDC. Not long ago, several crypto companies, including Robinhood, Kraken, Galaxy Digital, and Paxos, came together to support the development of the Global Dollar (USDG). Its proponents claim the asset will help speed up the adoption of such instruments around the world.

37553397,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626662,1734027189,Trump doubles down on crypto and Wall Street ambitions with more promises,"Donald Trump walked into the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) today with the swagger of a man who just won it all — again. Fresh off a historic comeback and solid Republican control of Congress, the president wasted no time pushing his economic agenda. He even rang the opening bell himself. This first public act was no coincidence. The NYSE, the heart of American capitalism, became the stage for him to reiterate all his bold promises: slashing corporate taxes, ramping up crypto innovation, and making America the global leader in artificial intelligence. “We’re going to do something great with crypto,” the ‘crypto president’ declared. He then casually took a jab at China while also shouting out its president, Mr. Xi Jinping, whom he likes very much now apparently . Tax cuts, tariffs, and Wall Street fanfare Flanked by heavyweights like Intercontinental Exchange CEO Jeffrey Sprecher, Trump pledged to bring the corporate tax rate down to 15% for businesses that produce on U.S. soil. “You pay 21% if you don’t build here. If you do, we’re going to try and get it to 15%,” Trump announced. His economic team, which includes Scott Bessent, Howard Lutnick, and Kelly Loeffler, stood alongside him as he outlined his vision to energize domestic manufacturing. Wall Street cheered his return, with applause erupting from the trading floor as Trump rang the bell. Traders chanted “USA” while the president-elect basked in the symbolism of the moment. For Trump, the stock market remains a barometer of success, as we’ve pointed out in the past. During his first term, the S&P 500 surged nearly 68%, boosted by corporate tax cuts and favorable Federal Reserve policies. Now, he’s promising even more. But Trump’s relationship with the market isn’t without risks. His plan includes sweeping tariffs targeting both allies and adversaries. Economists warn these moves could raise prices for American businesses and consumers. Still, the president insists the long-term gains will outweigh the short-term pain. “This is going to be a country like no other,” he said with a smirk. Crypto, AI, and the Bitcoin race While Wall Street is familiar territory, Trump’s focus on crypto was a major pivot. He’s determined to push the U.S. to the forefront of blockchain innovation, with the crypto-loving Senator Cynthia Lummis standing firmly in his corner. Lummis told the community, “America won the Space Race. Now America must win the Bitcoin Race.” She then promised Trump that she was willing to do everything she could to help him achieve his crypto ambitions. Talk about a true believer. Meanwhile, former Bitcoin hater and NYSE legend Jimmy Cramer was all smiles as he interviewed Trump at the event. He was the one who asked him those crypto-related questions, confirming his newfound love for crypto, which started a few weeks ago. A star-studded lineup and high stakes Trump’s NYSE appearance was a spectacle. Alongside him were key cabinet picks, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum for the Interior Department. Wall Street titans like Goldman Sachs’ David Solomon and Pershing Square’s Bill Ackman were also in attendance. Ackman praised Trump’s pro-business stance, saying, “The more successful businesses are, the more wages rise.” But Trump’s proposals come at a time when markets are already on edge. We’ve seen the S&P 500 climb since the election, driven by optimism over his tax cuts and deregulation promises. But some economists are worried that his hardline approach could backfire, but his supporters see it as a bold move to protect American interests. Even as Trump avoided telling investors to buy stocks outright, his bullish tone was unmistakable. “I don’t want to say that and then we have a dip or something,” he told Jimmy.

37553070,https://finbold.com/?p=219067,1734027017,Buy signal for two strong cryptocurrencies this week,"The cryptocurrency market is showing signs of renewed volatility following a sharp rise in the US Producer Price Index (PPI) to 3% in November, its highest level since February 2023. This unexpected surge, coupled with last month’s accelerating Consumer Price Index (CPI), has exceeded market forecasts and dampened optimism for a Federal Reserve rate cut at next week’s FOMC meeting. As uncertainty looms over financial markets, Finbold analyzed the Relative Strength Index (RSI) heatmap from CoinGlass on December 12 to spot emerging buy opportunities, offering investors potential entry points during this critical market phase. Synthetix (SNX) Synthetix ( SNX ) offers a strong buy signal for traders and investors, supported by its robust RSI metrics and favorable technical indicators. The 24-hour RSI of 65.16 reflects solid momentum, signaling upward movement while avoiding overbought conditions. The recent price drop of 5.2% represents a healthy consolidation phase, which often precedes a bullish breakout, providing an optimal entry point for market participants. Crypto Market RSI Heatmap, 12-hour chart: SNX. Source: CoinGlass Further supporting this outlook, SNX’s moving averages strongly favor a bullish trajectory, with 14 out of 15 moving averages signaling a buy, including critical exponential moving averages (EMAs) at 10, 20, and 200. With the broader market 12-hour RSI remaining neutral at 51.99, SNX is well-positioned to capitalize on a potential market recovery, making it a high-potential asset for both short-term and medium-term gains. Alien Worlds (TLM) Alien Worlds ( TLM ) stands out as a strong buy in the current market, supported by a combination of robust technical indicators and sustained momentum. The cryptocurrency has delivered an impressive daily gain of 11.66%, signaling renewed investor interest despite a 12-hour decline of 8.25%, which suggests a brief consolidation phase. This recovery aligns with broader bullish indicators, placing TLM in a favorable position for potential upward movement. Crypto Market RSI Heatmap, 12-hour chart: TLM. Source: CoinGlass The technical setup further bolsters the bullish outlook. Moving averages paint a decisive picture, with 14 buy signals and zero sell signals across key metrics, including exponential and simple averages spanning 10 to 200 periods. This indicates strength across both short- and long-term trends. Meanwhile, the RSI values add another layer of validation. TLM’s RSI readings range from 60.47 in 15 minutes to 67.34 at one hour, with a 24-hour average of 64.26, outperforming the 12-hour market RSI of 51.99. This indicates stronger buying pressure and upward momentum relative to the broader market. Key oscillators, including the MACD and Momentum indicators, also flash buy signals. With technical indicators aligned and market momentum signaling further gains, TLM presents a favorable entry point for traders and investors. Despite the strong buy signals highlighted for these two cryptocurrencies, the market’s inherent volatility calls for caution. Investors are advised to remain vigilant, closely monitor market developments, and adapt to changing market dynamics to make informed decisions.

37554227,https://invezz.com/?p=2385514,1734026855,Ukraine plans to finalise crypto regulations by early 2025,"Ukraine looks to regulate the cryptocurrency sector in 2025 but plans to offer no tax incentives for the sector. Speaking at a recent forum, Verkhovna Rada’s head of the tax committee, Daniil Getmantsev, confirmed Ukraine’s plans to finalise a draft bill to regulate the crypto space by the first quarter of 2025. The bill is currently being reviewed by a dedicated work group that is working closely with the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to ensure comprehensive regulation of digital assets, with a focus on financial stability, fiscal oversight, and compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures. The goal here is to create a transparent and secure framework to foster a regulated cryptocurrency market for both investors and businesses. No incentives Previously, rumours suggested that Ukraine’s regulatory approach would also look to offer tax incentives for the sector. However, Getmantsev has clarified that won’t be the case. Instead, the market would be treated as subject to standard taxation rules, similar to securities trading, with profits from cryptocurrency transactions subject to capital gains tax upon conversion to fiat currencies. With this approach, the regulators plan to mitigate the risks of tax evasion and ensure a stable flow of tax revenue to the country from crypto-related activities while maintaining fiscal integrity and reducing the potential for abuse through “tax incentives” that could be exploited for “tax evasion in traditional markets.” The development comes as the war between Ukraine and Russia continues to impact the local economy, with cryptocurrencies expected to be a vital tool for accessing financial support, protecting assets from inflation, and facilitating cross-border transactions without relying on traditional banking systems, which often face disruptions during times of distress. Bitcoin had already become a crucial asset for Ukrainians during the war, providing a reliable means of transferring funds, receiving donations, and safeguarding savings against inflation. Its decentralized nature has proven resilient , allowing individuals and organizations to bypass restrictions imposed by disrupted banking systems and government controls, further cementing its role as a store of value and a lifeline in times of crisis. Meanwhile, the IMF has urged Ukraine to fast-track its crypto legislation efforts. Earlier this year, the nation signed the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies, which outlines the need to finalise the update of virtual asset legislation by the end of 2024. Russia is also strengthening crypto efforts On the other side, Russia has also sped up its efforts to get a grip on the crypto sector. Last month, President Vladimir Putin signed a law that allows the country to tax crypto assets as property and regulate the mining sector. However, Russia offers an exemption from Value Added Tax (VAT) on crypto mining and the sale of digital currencies, unlike Ukraine, which has yet to introduce such provisions in its regulatory framework. Additionally, there have also been talks to establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve following in the footsteps of a Donald Trump-led United States.

To read full editions, subscribe . Bitcoin enthusiasts often hear terms like “zk rollups” thrown around, but the reality is more nuanced. While Ethereum’s zk rollups rely on zero-knowledge proofs for trustless verification, Bitcoin’s architectural constraints make implementing true zk rollups a distant goal. Misleading claims around Bitcoin’s layer-2 capabilities and trust assumptions threaten to confuse users, and the Bitcoin builder community is working to clarify these issues. Ethereum zk rollups leverage the Ethereum mainnet (layer-1) to verify cryptographic proofs directly onchain. Bitcoin, with its 4MB block size and limited scripting capabilities, can’t accommodate these computationally intensive verifiers. As Alexei Zamyatin, a core contributor to BitVM, explains, a zk rollup verifier “simply won’t fit into a block.” Projects like BitVM take a different approach , combining SNARK-based compression with optimistic verification. Rather than verifying proofs onchain, BitVM splits a program into smaller chunks, each verifiable sequentially. This method mirrors optimistic rollups like Arbitrum rather than Ethereum’s zk rollups. Screenshot “The zk part stops at the compression stage,” Alexei notes. “Everything else is an optimistic fraud-proof system.” The broader discussion about Bitcoin L2s goes beyond just rollups. In a recent thread, Janusz Grzegorz, founder of Bitcoin Layers, reflected on the evolving definition of Bitcoin L2s. Initially, Bitcoin layers evaluated projects based on their claim of being a “Bitcoin L2,” but this approach excluded meaningful activity like BTC-backed tokens on Ethereum L2s. Janusz advocates for a shift in focus to trust assumptions instead of semantics. He proposes evaluating the bridges that underpin these systems regardless of whether they market themselves as an L2. These include protocols like Rootstock, tBTC on Arbitrum and others. Grzegorz, known online simply as “Janusz,” also has flagged projects like Merlin and BitcoinOS as having contributed to the confusion. Such projects often market themselves as zk rollups on Bitcoin, despite lacking the infrastructure to deliver security guarantees on par with how the term “rollups” is typically used. He cautions users to scrutinize projects for real progress, such as distributed or optimistic bridges, rather than relying on buzzwords. For Zamyatin, education and transparency are key. By focusing on trust assumptions, clear definitions and robust analyses, the Bitcoin community can better understand what’s feasible — and what’s not. For now, zk rollups on Bitcoin remain a misnomer, but innovations like BitVM demonstrate how Bitcoin can scale within its unique constraints. To achieve true zk rollups , Bitcoin will require a soft fork to enable building a native zk verifier. Several new opcodes are currently under consideration amid a recent push to clarify Bitcoin’s future roadmap. An open Wiki-style forum lets interested stakeholders express their preferences and justify their views. Zamyatin’s team at Build on Bitcoin (BOB) has yet to weigh in, but expects to soon. “What’s great about this effort is that it collects rationales in one place — instead of fighting on Twitter or scattered threads, you can see the reasoning for each individual’s stance,” Zamyatin said. “It makes it easier to evaluate proposals, summarize pros and cons, and have meaningful discussions.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trumps-tariffs-trumptar-solana-memecoin-will-explode-16000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

According to Reuters , David Solomon says US regulations need to change before the bank can start holding and trading crypto assets. Says Solomon during an interview at the Reuters NEXT conference in New York, “That’s a question you have to ask regulators. At the moment, as a regulated banking institution, we’re not allowed to own a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin as a principal. We give our clients advice around a variety of these technologies and these issues and will continue to do that, but for the moment our ability to act in these markets is extremely limited from a regulatory perspective.” Solomon’s statement comes amid growing interest in crypto-focused financial products. Investment giant BlackRock’s Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded fund is now bigger than its gold exchange-traded fund despite the latter’s 19-year head start. The crypto market is also anticipated to explode following the victory of Donald Trump in the November election. The president-elect promised to implement policies that will solidify crypto self-custody and bolster the growth of the industry. Trump also picked crypto-friendly Scott Bessent and Paul Atkins as Treasury Secretary and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair, which is regarded as an early sign of an incoming shift in the government’s stance on digital assets.

The act serves as a testing ground for the U.S. Treasury. Dennis Porter who helped draft the bill congratulated Giovanni Capriglione and confirmed on X that the official bill has been filed for the Texas Bitcoin Reserve. He also said that the bill was officially introduced live on X spaces. I can confirm that the state of Texas has filed a bill to officially establish a ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve’. History was made as this was the first time a bill was filed live on X Spaces. Congrats to @VoteGiovanni for his leadership on Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/uorZoRgXsC — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) December 12, 2024 According to a CNBC report , Republican State Representative Giovanni Capriglione announced that the aim of this bill is to make Texas a leader in Bitcoin innovation and improve the state’s financial stability. The bill would allow the state to accept taxes, fees, and donations in Bitcoin. Capriglione said, “Probably the biggest enemy of our investments is inflation”. Therefore the state will benefit from a strategic bitcoin reserve, and investing in bitcoin. He stated “I just filed the bill. It’s a bill to be entitled ‘An act relating to the establishment of a bitcoin reserve within the state treasury of Texas and the management of cryptocurrencies by governmental entities'”. Texas has the most Bitcoin miners in the country Texas is the second-largest economy in the U.S. and the eighth-largest in the world. It also has the most Bitcoin miners in the country. There is a hope that miners will someday start paying their taxes with Bitcoin. However, the bill does not include a strategy for purchasing Bitcoin. Capriglione says he wants “to make this bill as big and broad as possible”. The first step provides flexibility. Capriglione is hopeful that with more legislators’ support, the bill will be stronger. Since the election, support for a national bitcoin reserve has grown. It is a promise from President-elect Donald Trump. Demands of a reserve have helped push Bitcoin up over 45% as investors are betting on the further increase in its price if the Bitcoin reserve finds a way. Pennsylvania was the first among the states to introduce Bitcoin reserve in November Dennis Porter, CEO of the Satoshi Action Fund, shared discussions are ongoing in up to 10 more states and four countries on the same legislation intended to be proposed soon. Porter has also helped lawmakers in other states with bitcoin laws. These l aws include protecting the rights to mine, self custody, run a node, all peer to peer transactions. They have been passed in Oklahoma, Louisiana, Montana, and Arkansas. Satoshi Act Fund has introduced 30 bills, including Pennsylvania’s.

The bill, introduced by Republican State Representative Giovanni Capriglione during an X Spaces event today, proposes accepting taxes, fees, and donations denominated in Bitcoin that will be held for at least five years. Capriglione noted that the initiative aims to strengthen Texas’ financial stability while also supporting its leadership in Bitcoin adoption. “Probably the biggest enemy of our investments is inflation,” he explained. “A strategic BTC reserve, investing in BTC, would be a win-win for the state.” The bill, titled An Act to Establish a Bitcoin Reserve in the Texas State Treasury and to Manage Cryptocurrencies by Public Institutions, demonstrates Texas’ desire to leverage its significant Bitcoin mining presence, the highest concentration in the United States, to further integrate crypto into its economy. While the bill does not include a direct BTC purchase strategy, the hope is that miners and businesses operating in Texas will start paying taxes in BTC. “My goal is to make this bill as big and comprehensive as possible,” Capriglione said, adding that future iterations could expand depending on legislative support. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Futures Announces New Altcoin Listing The proposal comes amid growing calls for a national bitcoin reserve, one of President-elect Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly campaign promises. Bitcoin has rallied more than 45% since the election as investors see such initiatives driving adoption and boosting its value. But analysts are skeptical of the federal government creating a BTC reserve. “It’s unlikely that the U.S. government will buy BTC in any meaningful capacity, but the idea does help rekindle optimism in the market,” John Todaro of Needham told CNBC. Texas is not alone in exploring strategic Bitcoin reserves. Pennsylvania introduced a similar bill last month, and at least 10 states and four countries are considering related legislation. States such as Oklahoma, Louisiana, Montana, and Arkansas have already passed laws protecting BTC mining, self-custody, and peer-to-peer transactions. Porter, a co-author of the Texas bill and a proponent of BTC legislation nationwide, said these initiatives aim to chart a path forward for crypto integration. “We have 30 bills introduced so far, and the momentum is building,” Porter said. *This is not investment advice.

37552208,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98791,1734025308,Ripple’s XRP Explosion Above $6 Price In The Cards As On-Chain Metrics Show Crazy XRP Momentum,"A crypto trader has projected a bull case for XRP above $6 in 2025 amid recent accumulations. These inflows marked by institutional and retail interest have pushed the altcoin past several resistance levels. Jacob Canfield revealed on X (formerly Twitter) that the price of the asset is set for new highs based on on-chain analysis. He explained that considering Fibonacci extensions to project the tide, XRP will soar to $6.6, a figure two times the previous all-time high. In 2017, XRP hit an all-time high at $3.4 but experienced weak sentiments over the years. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit on Ripple and two executives led to a reduced rally, with the price trading below $1. “ The only difference between this $XRP move and those in the past is the price of Bitcoin is 5X higher than it was in 2017. If we use Canfield Fibonacci extensions to give us an idea of where this move may take us, it would be at the 11.09 fib extension. This would put the price around $6.60, exactly 2X the value of its previous high,” Canfield wrote. According to Canfield, this price will also become the ideal FOMO target amid high buys from institutional clients. While XRP whales remain present, crypto users shared mixed reactions to the price projection. As expected, the XRP army agreed with the move, citing upcoming positive regulations in the United States. Recently, Ripple CEO hinted that the resignation of outgoing SEC chair Gary Gensler played a key role in the rise of XRP. On the other hand, some crypto users say the projection is a huge leap from present market expectations. XRP Price Action At press time, XRP trades at $2.41, a 4% drop from previous highs, while weekly and monthly numbers remain in the green zone. Last week, XRP price soared on the back of institutional accumulation, and retail volume was also on the rise. The asset’s market cap soared past $140 billion, flipping USDT to become the third largest crypto asset. Meanwhile, XRP Ledger lowered its minimum requirements from 10 XRP to 1 XRP. The move which drops the bar by 90% ($25.6 to $2.56) seeks to increase adoption from small-scale holders.

Just this week, Coinbase has onboarded Peanut The Squirrel (PNUT), Gigachad (GIGA) and Turbo (TURBO) meme coins on its spot exchange. Earlier this month, it also listed Mog Coin (MOG) and Moo Deng (MOODENG). There is now intense speculation on which meme coins could be next to be listed on Coinbase, with frog-themed tokens Pepe Unchained and Wall Street Pepe emerging as two of the top choices. Coinbase Lists Turbo, PNUT and GIGA - Best Meme Coins To Buy? Donald Trump’s win in last month’s US presidential elections has been a major boon for the meme coin sector, considering it gave Tier-1 CEXs like Coinbase and Binance regulatory clarity. Not long ago, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong revealed that the Biden-era US Securities and Exchange Commission had asked him to delist all cryptocurrencies, except Bitcoin, labelling them all “unregistered securities”. Now, Trump has appointed pro-crypto Paul Atkins as the new Chair of the SEC, sparking rumours that the agency could withdraw all its crypto lawsuits that called prominent altcoins, securities. Unsurprisingly, Coinbase is now listing new meme coins almost every day, gearing up for the highly-anticipated meme coin supercycle. As such, it is already behind Binance, which has been listing meme tokens for the past few months. Coinbase listed large-caps Pepe and Dogwifhat in November, following them up with several mid-caps and microcap meme coins. Just this week, Coinbase listed the Solana meme coin Gigachad ($GIGA), which resulted in a new all-time high for the token. The GIGA price is up by 23% over the past week and 60% since its Coinbase listing. Similarly, Turbo (TURBO) price hit a new all-time high valuation of $922 million, also rallying by over 60%. Both GIGA and TURBO are excellent candidates for the next billion-dollar meme coins. Peanut The Squirrel also appears poised for a new all-time high following its Coinbase debut, largely due to the heavy whale bidding. A new whale invested over $10 million in the PNUT coin on Binance just today. A whale created a new wallet and withdrew 8.41M $PNUT ($10.68M) from #Binance 2 hours ago. https://t.co/IbGMoWwAkE pic.twitter.com/22Vt0Yhpjw — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 12, 2024 Along with Gigachad and Turbo, Peanut The Squirrel continues to be backed by experts as one of the best meme coins to buy for the upcoming supercycle. Why Pepe Unchained and Wall Street Pepe Could Be The Next Coinbase Listings? Pepe Unchained has been one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies since its launch. It is not without any reason that it was the top trending crypto today on CoinMarketCap globally, ahead of Bitcoin and XRP. After falling to a market cap of $71 million, PEPU has surged by 630% to reach an all-time high of $522 million. The meme coin also appears poised to hit the billion-dollar mark. However, while Pepe Unchained has already exploded, whales are now bidding on Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) , a microcap meme coin that is still in its presale. WEPE added over $2.5 million to its ICO funds in just 24 hours and is set to hit the $8 million mark in just a few hours. $7M raised.

Floki offers projects like Valhalla, an NFT metaverse game, and FlokiFi, a DeFi service, enhancing its use within and outside its ecosystem. Its partnership with NOWPayments and the Floki Card enables real-world transactions with FLOKI tokens. This diversification into NFTs, DeFi, and practical applications sets it apart from other meme coins. With its expanding ecosystem and recognition as a top meme coin to buy in 2023, Floki appears attractive in the current market cycle. BOME: Preserving memes with blockchain and decentralized storage The Book of Meme (BOME) is an experimental project that aims to redefine web3 culture by combining memes, decentralized storage solutions, and speculative coin trading and gambling. It seeks to capture the evolving meme culture within a digital compendium, ensuring each meme is preserved on the blockchain.

This initiative strives to create a new form of decentralized social media and make memes unstoppable.

With its distinct approach, Mew has the potential to attract investors looking for something different. In the current market cycle, the coin may appeal to those interested in emerging meme coins with growth potential. POPCAT coin: A potential opportunity in a stagnant market POPCAT is a new cryptocurrency introduced to breathe life into a market facing challenges like dead wallets and pump-and-dump schemes.

Its platform focuses on building trust and encouraging active participation from the community. In the current market cycle, POPCAT appears to be an attractive option for those seeking potential growth and a fresh start in the crypto space. Conclusion While coins like FLOKI, BOME, MEW, and POPCAT show some promise, their short-term potential is limited. DOGEN stands out for those seeking luxury and success, expecting 700% growth by the end of presale and potential massive returns this altcoin season.

After a period of steady gains, market participants are now focused on whether SHIB can muster enough strength to break past this critical threshold. A successful move above this level could ignite a fresh wave of bullish momentum, setting the stage for a potential rally. Will the bulls rise to the occasion, or will SHIB face renewed pressure? Analyzing SHIB’s Price Action: Is A Bullish Surge Imminent? SHIB’s price action is demonstrating a strengthening positive sentiment as it nears the critical $0.00002960 resistance level. The recent consolidation around this key price point suggests that a breakout could be imminent. Additionally, the fact that SHIB is trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) signals increasing confidence from buyers, further heightening expectations for a potential upward surge. Furthermore, the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that Shiba Inu may be primed for continued uptrend. The RSI has recently surged past the 50% threshold and is currently positioned at 53%, signaling an increase in bullish momentum. Specifically, this shift implies that buying pressure is gaining traction, and the market sentiment is turning more optimistic. An RSI above 50% typically signals that buyers are in control, which could further propel SHIB toward higher resistance levels. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Braces For Rally – Analyst Sees 35% Price Surge – Details If the RSI maintains its upward trajectory, it will likely support the continuation of the current rally, possibly leading to a breakout. However, sustaining this momentum will be essential to confirm a successful breakout. Meanwhile, should Shiba Inu fail to break above the $0.00002960 resistance level with strong volume, it may face a pullback or a period of prolonged consolidation. This could cause the price to retest lower support areas as market sentiment shifts. A lack of follow-through above this level may discourage buyers, leading to a temporary stall in the uptrend. What Happens If Shiba Inu Breaks Above $0.00002960 Once SHIB surpasses the critical $0.00002960 resistance level, it could trigger a significant bullish rally. A successful breakout will attract more buying interest, signaling that the bulls are in control and pushing the price toward the next resistance level at $0.00003346 and other higher price targets. Related Reading: Shiba Inu All Set For ‘Bull Show’, Eyes 180% Rally – Analyst Additionally, a breakout above this level would reinforce positive market sentiment and could lead to a surge in trading volume, fueling the continuation of the upward momentum. However, sustained buying pressure will be essential for the price to stay above this key level and avoid a pullback.

The right investment today could bring significant returns in the near future, as both meme coins and altcoins are expected to rise in popularity and value. Whether traders are looking for the next big meme coin or an up-and-coming altcoin, this list is packed with four of the most promising assets in the crypto world. Let’s dive into their unique features and uncover which one stands out as the best crypto to buy now, before listings swoop in! 1. BlockDAG: The Future of Meme Coin Ecosystems BlockDAG (BDAG) is not just another blockchain project—it’s a revolutionary breakthrough for meme coins. Imagine a blockchain network that not only offers high transaction throughput and low fees but also allows anyone, even those without any technical expertise, to create and launch their own meme tokens and other dApps projects with ease. That's exactly what BlockDAG delivers. BlockDAG's low-code/no-code erases all entry barriers for meme coin creators who want to build quickly and scale without the usual blockchain barriers. By leveraging a novel Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, BlockDAG processes transactions in parallel, ensuring rapid, cost-effective operations—a feature that’s perfect for meme coins, which often see high-volume trading but low-value transactions. Since the start of its presale, BlockDAG has raised a staggering $161.5 million, with over 17 billion coins sold. Priced at just $0.0234 in batch 26, early BDAG coin adopters have seen a 2240% ROI since batch 1. Analysts remain bullish on this Layer-1, projecting that BDAG could hit $1 by 2025. This has caused a surge in whale activity further signaling BlockDAG’s potential to dominate the crypto market. BlockDAG’s scalable architecture combined with its ultra-accessible low-code no-code capabilities makes it an excellent choice for meme coin developers, and traders looking for the best crypto to buy now. As the demand for faster and cheaper blockchains grows, BlockDAG’s market share is primed for a massive increase. 2. BTFD Coin: Meme Coin with a Strong Community BTFD Coin (BTFD) is attracting attention for its strong community backing and meme-driven appeal. As a community-focused project, BTFD is tapping into the widespread meme coin hype with more than just fun. Its engaging community-driven approach sets it apart from others, providing a solid foundation for growth. Leveraging the ""buy the dip"" mentality, BTFD encourages its holders to act on market corrections and benefit from its meme-driven ecosystem. This meme coin is building a platform for long-term success, making it one of the best cryptos to buy now. 3. Turbo: Fueling the Meme Coin Race Turbo (TURBO) is quickly gaining traction in the meme coin world, thanks to its speed and low transaction costs. Designed to be efficient, Turbo is a high-reward crypto that’s ideal for those looking to profit from meme coin trends. Its scalability and fast-growing community make it one of the best cryptos to buy now. Turbo’s efficient platform also makes it an attractive investment, especially for those eager to capitalize on meme coin momentum in 2025. 4. Baby Doge Coin: A Popular Long-Term Meme Coin Baby Doge Coin (BABYDOGE) continues to grow its presence in the meme coin space, benefiting from the popularity of Dogecoin. Its loyal community and engaging social media presence have driven interest, while its expanding utility in DeFi adds to its appeal. For investors looking for a meme coin with long-term growth potential, Baby Doge Coin is a solid choice. Its consistent growth and dedicated fanbase make it one of the best cryptos to buy now. Choosing The Best Crypto to Buy Now Among the top projects discussed above, BlockDAG emerges as the best crypto to buy now for countless reasons. Its DAG-tech and low-code no-code capabilities position it as the next big launchpad for popular meme coins and dApps. On the other hand, for those preferring high-growth meme coins, BTFD, Turbo, and Baby Doge Coin also present promising opportunities. Ultimately, each coin offers unique features that make it an attractive opportunity, but BlockDAG’s scalable blockchain and integration capabilities position it as one of the most exciting presale crypto projects for 2025.

The rally in the BTC price comes following the announcement that, next to the U.S., Russian officials have appealed to the government to initiate a strategic Bitcoin reserve. This has led to more excitement in the crypto market and reclaiming the losses. Also, the earlier dip appeared due to the global economic conditions, where the investors were awaiting the upcoming U.S. CPI data, which is set to be released this Wednesday. Despite this correction, market experts remain optimistic, forecasting Bitcoin to hit multiple ATHs by 2025 as crypto adoption grows. When returning to the crypto market, NuDEX, a decentralized trading platform, has announced its “Bullish Trading Odyssey” testnet competition to boost the bullish momentum. The event is scheduled from December 16 to December 23. Also, the Bullish Trading Odyssey offers a chance to win a $5,000 USDT prize pool to boost participants, along with perks like trading fee credits for early birds and bonus rewards for top performers.

By being built on the GOAT network and powered by Zero-Knowledge MIPS technology, the platform offers fast transactions, privacy, and multi-chain compatibility. This unique architecture combines the efficiency of centralized exchanges with the self-custody and transparency principles of decentralized systems. The testnet competition is a significant step toward showcasing its capabilities and preparing for the mainnet launch in January 2025.

Don’t miss the chance—when passion, memes, and explosive potential meet, you’ll be glad you joined the winning team. Dogecoin Dogecoin started in 2013 as a fun twist on digital money. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it features a cute Shiba Inu dog as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin’s limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no cap on total supply. What began as a joke quickly caught on. In 2021, Dogecoin’s value soared, reaching a market cap over $50 billion. This surge was driven by social media buzz, especially tweets from Elon Musk. The coin showed how online communities and social media can shape financial markets. So, what makes Dogecoin stand out today? Its technology is simple and based on existing cryptocurrency models. It doesn’t have advanced features like some other coins. However, its strength lies in its community and widespread recognition. With influential supporters and a friendly image, Dogecoin continues to attract attention. In the current market, where many investors seek the next big thing, Dogecoin offers familiarity and potential. While other coins focus on complex technology, Dogecoin’s appeal is its simplicity. Whether it’s a good investment depends on market trends and personal goals, but Dogecoin remains a unique player in the crypto world. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin but with its own twist. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous creator named Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work smoothly with other parts of the Ethereum world. At the start, there were a quadrillion SHIB tokens. Half of them were sent to Vitalik Buterin, the co-creator of Ethereum, to build trust. Buterin then donated a large amount to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and “burned” 40% of the total supply. These actions brought a lot of attention to SHIB. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB’s connection to Ethereum opens up many possibilities. It allows for projects like ShibaSwap, where users can trade tokens without a middleman. There’s also talk of a future platform for unique digital items and a system where the community can have a say in decisions. These features could give SHIB more uses and make it stand out. In the current market, where people are looking for coins with real-world applications, SHIB’s plans might make it attractive to investors. Compared to other memecoins, SHIB seems to be aiming for more than just internet hype. Conclusion Although Dogecoin and Shiba Inu show promise, XYZVerse’s unique sports-meme fusion positions it for unparalleled growth in the current bull market.

On Dec. 12, Andreas Kohl, co-founder of Bitcoin sidechain Sequentia, claimed responsibility for crashing 69% of Dogecoin’s network. Kohl revealed that he used an old laptop in El Salvador to carry out the exploit. Before the attack, data from Blockchair showed Dogecoin had 647 active nodes. Following the breach, the network was reduced to 315 active nodes. Kohl explained that the exploit leveraged a vulnerability discovered by researcher Tobias Ruck. DogeReaper: A Fatal Flaw On Dec. 4, an X account called “Department Of DOGE Efficiency” publicly disclosed a vulnerability in the Dogecoin network that could have crashed it entirely. The vulnerability, dubbed “DogeReaper,” enables anyone to remotely crash Dogecoin nodes. The account likened the flaw to the “Death Note” concept from Japanese manga and anime, where writing someone’s name in a notebook leads to their death by heart attack. Similarly, DogeReaper allows attackers to target a node’s address, causing it to fail due to a segmentation fault. In computing, a segmentation fault occurs when a program tries to access restricted memory, prompting the operating system to halt the program for safety. The account warned that because Dogecoin node addresses are public, “anyone could crash the entire Dogecoin network in an instant” using this vulnerability. “If a malicious actor had discovered this bug instead of us, they could have stopped the Dogecoin network for at least a few days, with no transactions or blocks,” the account stated. Despite the significant potential for damage, the account reported that Coinbase classified the vulnerability as low severity and rewarded Tobias Ruck with $200 for the discovery.",NEGATIVE,DOGE,BTC | DOGE | EXCHANGE,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/dogecoin-network-crashes-as-hacker-exploits-critical-vulnerability/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The Avalanche ( AVAX ) blockchain raised the funds through token sales from over 40 investment ventures to support its ambitious Layer-1 blockchain overhaul, dubbed “Avalanche9000.” The $250 million injection will be used to develop technology aimed at reducing transaction costs and attracting more network validators, according to a statement from the L1 protocol. Avalanche announced that the upgrade would slash on-chain application deployment costs by 99%, significantly lowering the entry barrier for both new and existing AVAX developers. The Avalanche9000 upgrade is currently live on a testnet, providing developers with a space to conduct “blockchain dress rehearsals.” Network upgrades typically roll out on testnets before their deployment on the mainnet. Additionally, Avalanche announced $40 million in grants to incentivize developer activity. Previous reports stated that on-chain activity increased after the testnet and reward announcements.

Gareth Soloway, Chief Market Strategist of Verified Investing, discussed the recent surge and its connection to broader market trends in an interview with David Lin . While Bitcoin has been rising, Soloway said that it is closely tied to the performance of the stock market. When the stock market drops, Bitcoin often follows, so traders should stay alert for potential pullbacks. The Next Bitcoin Target: $107K-$108K According to Soloway, Bitcoin’s next major resistance is between $107,000 and $108,000. The current chart shows that Bitcoin is following a parallel trend, where the price tends to bounce when it hits the lower end of the range. Soloway believes that once Bitcoin reaches the $107K-$108K level, a larger correction could occur, which is something to watch out for. Long-Term View: Support and Buying Opportunities Looking at Bitcoin’s larger trend, Soloway said that past price cycles show a pattern where the highs of previous cycles tend to become support in the next one. He suggests that if Bitcoin pulls back to the $74,000 to $75,000 range, this could be a great opportunity to buy for the next upward movement. Understanding Bitcoin’s Volatility Bitcoin’s price volatility is partly driven by psychological factors. When Bitcoin reaches key levels, like the $100K mark, many traders rush in out of fear of missing out on further gains. However, once these traders have bought in, the market can experience a pullback, as seen recently when Bitcoin briefly hit $104K before dropping to $92K. This sudden drop is often a result of a lack of buyers below key levels. Next Steps for Bitcoin Bitcoin’s journey towards $100K has sparked many questions about its future. While it’s possible that Bitcoin may see further upward movement, there could be a correction in the near future, especially as it approaches key resistance levels. With Bitcoin’s long-term trend still bullish, many traders are looking to buy during corrections, especially if Bitcoin drops to the $74K-$75K range.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoins-potential-price-surge-to-108k-will-a-dip-to-74k-follow/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

The project’s open mainnet launch awaits final verifications, with updates expected in the following weeks. Pi Network Outpaces Binance on This Front The cryptocurrency project Pi Network, which allows individuals to mine digital assets directly from their smartphones, remains one of the most discussed topics in the space. It saw the light of day over five years ago but its open mainnet and native token have yet to go live. Despite the surrounding controversy, Pi Network has amassed a multi-million community. Not long ago, the team revealed the project’s application had exceeded the milestone of 100 million downloads. One country where Pi Network has created a stronghold is South Korea. Wu Blockchain recently reported that the exact figure of local users has reached 1.34 million. In fact, the only two domestic crypto-related entities having more users are the popular exchanges Upbit (4.36 million) and Bithumb (2.24 million). The local Pi Network community outpaced Binance’s clients in South Korea in terms of numbers. Those employing the services of Coinbase, Bitget, and Bybit are also outnumbered by the project’s users. Other Asian countries with solid Pi Network communities include China, Vietnam, India, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, and others. Recent Pi Network Updates As mentioned above, the Pi Network community is still waiting for the launch of the project’s native cryptocurrency and open network. Earlier this year, the team claimed that the latter will see the light of day once 15 million users complete the necessary verifications. Not long ago, Pi News revealed that 14 million people have already complied with the rules, with only one million left to do so . The final deadline is December 31. The date was moved several times, causing mixed reactions from the community. The latest extension was disclosed at the end of November, after which some people speculated that the team might continue to announce delays instead of setting things into motion. Meanwhile, December is expected to be quite eventful for Pi Network users. After all, the Pi Core Team previously promised to announce the mainnet open roadmap, which should provide more clarity on when users will be able to buy and sell Pi tokens. It remains to be seen whether the final weeks of 2024 will bring significant developments or if the pessimists will turn right.

Solana (SOL) has captured attention with its renewed developer activity and surging price, largely driven by gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi) innovations. On the other hand, ZIGnaly (ZIG) is making waves in the trading world with its user-friendly automation tools that let investors trade like pros. But there’s a new contender entering the spotlight: Qubetics ($TICS). This presale project is turning heads with its revolutionary approach to crypto payments and asset management, addressing the issues that have plagued the industry for years. Let’s break down what makes these three cryptos the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Qubetics ($TICS): Simplifying Payments and Innovating Asset Management Qubetics is more than just another crypto; it’s a solution to the headaches that have kept everyday people from fully embracing digital assets. Imagine running a business and accepting payments from customers worldwide. With Qubetics’ smart contract conversion mechanism , crypto payments are instantly converted into fiat at the point of sale. No volatility risks, no delays—just a smooth transaction every time. For individuals, Qubetics integrates with Apple Pay and Google Pay, making crypto payments feel as natural as swiping your card. Whether you’re paying for groceries or splitting a check with friends, this wallet eliminates the hassle of managing multiple platforms and currencies. Businesses love its efficiency in handling cross-border payments , cutting costs, and streamlining processes. Currently, in Presale Phase 12, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.0311. With over 313 million tokens sold and $5.7 million raised, the project is building serious momentum. Investors have plenty to look forward to, with a 10% price hike in the next phase and a projected post-presale ROI of 900%. Qubetics is already setting a new standard for what crypto can achieve, making it a must-have in your portfolio. Solana (SOL): The Comeback Kid Solana has been through its share of ups and downs, but December 2024 is proving to be a turning point. According to Cointelegraph , renewed activity in Solana’s ecosystem is driving its price higher, fueled by fresh interest in gaming, NFTs, and DeFi. Projects like Star Atlas and Marinade Finance are not only revitalizing the network but also attracting new users. What makes Solana stand out? Its blazing-fast transaction speeds and rock-bottom fees. Developers are flocking to the network because it offers a scalable and cost-effective environment for building decentralized applications (dApps). This has made Solana a go-to choice for next-gen gaming platforms and NFT marketplaces. Of course, it’s not all smooth sailing. Network outages have raised questions about reliability, and competition from Ethereum and Cardano is heating up. But Solana’s resilience and ability to innovate make it one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. If you’re looking for a project that balances speed, scalability, and a vibrant ecosystem, SOL is hard to beat. ZIGnaly (ZIG): A Smarter Way to Trade ZIGnaly is like the Swiss Army knife of crypto trading. Whether you’re a newbie or a seasoned investor, this platform simplifies the process with automated tools that do the heavy lifting for you. Its Copy Trading feature lets users mirror the moves of top-performing traders, taking the guesswork out of investing. But ZIGnaly isn’t just for passive traders. Recent updates have added staking options, allowing users to earn passive income while they trade. The platform’s multi-chain support also makes it a versatile choice for investors looking to diversify their portfolios. As for the ZIG token, it’s an integral part of the ecosystem, used for transactions and accessing premium features. While it doesn’t promise the explosive returns of a presale project like Qubetics, ZIGnaly offers long-term value for those seeking a hands-off trading experience. In a market filled with complexities, ZIGnaly’s straightforward approach makes it one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Which Crypto Deserves a Spot in Your Portfolio? So, who comes out on top in this crypto showdown? Qubetics ($TICS) is the trailblazer revolutionizing payments and asset management, Solana (SOL) is the resilient network powering the next wave of dApps, and ZIGnaly (ZIG) is the smart trader’s best friend. Each offers unique strengths, making them some of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 . If you’re after massive ROI and cutting-edge innovation, Qubetics is a no-brainer. For those who believe in blockchain scalability and DeFi growth, Solana is the clear choice. And if you’re all about automation and ease of use, ZIGnaly should be on your radar. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics ($TICS), Solana (SOL), and ZIGnaly (ZIG) as top picks for explosive growth this December.

37551395,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98787,1734023317,Could TON and Solana Break All-Time Highs? Analyst Makes Bullish Projections,"A crypto analyst has tipped Solana (SOL) and Toncoin (TON) to break new all-time highs as activities ramp up. Altcoins have grown significantly since Bitcoin’s price moved to the $80,000 mark as traders looked to maintain buying confidence. Among other positives are institutional demand, a spike in retail investors, and decentralized finance (DeFi) activities. A new CryptoQuant report projects SOL and TON to become the next digital assets to hit all-time highs after Bitcoin and BNB. According to him, both projects are supported by strong on-chain factors that can swing the price of assets. The broader market movement adds to this projection with an influx of retail traders. “ Following Bitcoin, Binance’s BNB has already reached its all-time high. Among other contenders, Solana (SOL) is a standout, sitting just 8% below its ATH, while Toncoin (TON) follows closely at 15% below its peak. Both projects are supported by strong fundamentals, including active development teams and active networks. Given these figures, it seems likely that these coins could follow Bitcoin’s lead in the near future.” Solana and Toncoin Clinches Explosive Year Solana has recorded an upward twelve-month swing to a new all-time high before a market correction. This came two years after the collapse of FTX, which sent its token downward alongside DeFi volumes. Solana’s possible upward march is expected to flow from institutional investors amid anticipation for spot ETFs in the United States. Like Bitcoin, spot Solana ETFs are expected to attract large sums with signs already seen in its weekly institutional flows. Similarly, meme coins also led to a break out this year for the asset, with tokens making 100X gains, igniting the wider community. SOL exchanges hands at $227, down 4% today, while weekly numbers move sideways. On the other hand, TON trades at $6.4, marking a similar loss of 4%. Although on-chain factors are positive for the asset, recent numbers are crawling. This year, TON is up a staggering 184% following surging ecosystem activities. Bitcoin and BNB Drives Spark Bitcoin maintains its dominance, hitting new all-time highs and inspiring the market to new levels. The top crypto price soared above $100K, setting the tone for altcoins. Over the years, price swings in Bitcoin led to altcoin season in the latter stages of the cycle. Last week, BNB’s price gained significant momentum, tapping an all-time high on Dec 4.

37550868,https://thecoinrise.com/bitcoin-atm-giant-byte-federal-reports-data-breach/,1734022750,Bitcoin ATM Giant Byte Federal Reports Data Breach,"Byte Federal, a well-known Bitcoin ATM provider, has revealed a serious data breach that may have exposed the personal information of 58,000 customers. The company reported this incident in a regulatory filing with Maine’s attorney general. The breach happened on September 30, but the company only discovered it nearly two months later, on November 18. Impact Of The Breach on Byte Federal Customers Attackers exploited a vulnerability in the popular developer platform GitLab to access Byte Federal’s network without permission. They stole sensitive information, including names, addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, government-issued IDs, transaction details, and user photographs. Notably, the company acted quickly to fix the issue as soon as it was discovered. The company also cooperates with law enforcement and regulatory authorities to investigate the attack. They also plan to notify affected customers and offer resources, such as credit monitoring services, to help reduce potential harm. In the meantime, Byte Federal customers should stay alert and check their financial accounts for any unusual activity. They should also reset their passwords, especially for those who have yet to do so. However, this incident shows how important it is to protect personal data as our financial interactions become more digital. Hackers Return Funds to US Government After Breach In October, a daring hacker breached a US government crypto wallet and withdrew $20 million. Surprisingly, the funds were returned within 24 hours. The twist left experts and investigators puzzled: was it a change of heart or something more calculated? The attackers did not refund all the stolen funds. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported that the government crypto wallet received $19.3 million, 87% of the stolen funds. The exact reason for this swift return remains mysterious, sparking speculation within the crypto community. However, the remaining funds yet uncovered are those transferred to instant exchanges like Switchain, HitBTC, and NExchange. These rapid transactions may suggest an attempt to liquidate part of the loot before returning the bulk. The Surge of Crypto Scams and Hacks The rapid rise of digital assets has led to a significant increase in scams and hacks despite the stringent regulations being introduced. Common scams include Ponzi schemes, phishing attacks, wallet breaches , and fake initial coin offerings, often employing social engineering tactics to deceive investors. High-profile hacks, such as Mt.Gox and Bitfinex breaches, have resulted in staggering losses , highlighting vulnerabilities in established platforms. As these threats grow, there is a growing demand for regulatory measures to protect investors and enhance security.

37550871,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98785,1734022369,Analyst Predicts 150% Potential Up Side For BNB As Price And Volume Hit All-Time High,"Binance Coin (BNB) bulls held firm on Thursday, sustaining strong momentum despite relatively subdued price action throughout the day, following a robust surge in recent weeks. Notably, the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization soared to as high as $793 on December 4 before experiencing a pullback to retest the $630 multi-year support in the following days. Despite the dip, BNB’s strength remained resilient, with continued upward pressure in the market. On December 8, 2024, BNB achieved a significant milestone, reaching an all-time high while trading volume surged to unprecedented levels. J.A. Maartunn, an analyst at CryptoQuant, highlighted this development, noting that BNB’s recent price increase has been matched by a notable rise in trading volume, signaling increased investor interest. “Price has been rising, with a strong rally starting in early 2024. Now, at the end of the year, BNB is climbing again and reaching its all-time high 4 days ago. Recent price increases match higher trading volume, showing more interest from investors.” He wrote. The pundit further emphasized that trading activity has grown since mid-2023, with the 30-day moving average nearing its all-time high. Martunn suggested that this growth could be attributed to positive changes at Binance or favorable market conditions in 2024. Notably, this observation underscores the heightened market activity around BNB, demonstrating sustained investor confidence and growing market activity. Elsewhere, several key technical indicators reinforce this optimistic outlook. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) recently showed a bullish crossover, signaling strong upward momentum. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has climbed to 0.12, increasing buying pressure and growing trader confidence. Meanwhile, analysts are becoming increasingly bullish on Binance Coin (BNB), with George “Softquant,” a TradingView analyst, pointing out that despite heightened competition from Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), BNB still has strong growth potential. In his analysis, George compared BNB’s performance to Tron (TRX), which has surged by 68% over the past month. “I think BNB has a lot of upside potential, but not to the extent we’ve seen with others like Tron. My target for BNB is about 150% upside from current prices,” George stated. Furthermore, although he recognizes that BNB may not see the same explosive growth as some other assets, he remained optimistic about its long-term potential due to its strong position within the Binance ecosystem and the broader market. “If you’re looking for a safe 4x, I don’t know if it’s going to give it because of how big it is… but I do think it’s going to give quite a bit of a move out of this,” he added. Recently, analyst Ali Martinez suggested BNB could be on the verge of a breakout. He’s closely watching for a weekly close above $662, which could signal a potential surge to $1,630. At press time, BNB was trading at $720.40, reflecting a 3.50% surge over the past 24 hours.",POSITIVE,BNB,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/analyst-predicts-150-potential-up-side-for-bnb-as-price-and-volume-hit-all-time-high/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

In a recent statement, Trump spoke of his vision to integrate crypto into the country’s strategic priorities, saying it was necessary to leave international competitors like China behind. “We’re going to do something great in the crypto space,” Trump said. “We don’t want China or anyone else to adopt it before us. We want to be the leader.” Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Futures Announces New Altcoin Listing Trump’s remarks also touched on the broader technological landscape, including artificial intelligence (AI). He noted that it was important to stay “well ahead of AI” in addressing the infrastructure demands of such developments. “We’re going to need a tremendous amount of electricity, more than double what we have now, to support these industries,” he added. As part of his energy strategy, Trump praised his proposed environmental oversight chairman, Lee Zeldin, for being effective in speeding up approvals for energy projects, saying clean and efficient solutions were needed to meet the nation's growing energy demands, with a focus on harnessing natural gas. *This is not investment advice.

The advert directed users to invest in Huabao Overseas Technology C (QDII-FOF-LOF) . According to community users, Alipay featured adverts promoting a crypto fund on its homepage on December 12. Users highlighted the ads stated, “Global investment, cryptocurrency soaring, start investing from 10 yuan, get on board now.” Community users receive Bitcoin ETF ads on Alipay’s homepage Huabao Overseas Technology C (QDII-FOF-LOF), an open-end fund, reportedly indirectly holds Coinbase stocks and ARK Invest spot ETF by investing in Wood Sister’s fund. Huabao Overseas technology has a limit mechanism that only allows users to buy 1000 yuan daily on Alipay. Source: Colin Wu on X According to the Huabao Overseas Technology Equity Securities Investment Fund report for Q3 2024, the fund mainly invests in overseas technology-themed funds such as Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) . The company added that it ultimately invests in stocks that use technology as an anchor for the long-term development of enterprises. The adverts on Alipay’s homepage sparked conversation among users, some of whom predicted the next phase would be purchasing Bitcoin directly with Alipay. Yifan He, CEO of Chinese blockchain firm Red Date Technology, Ant Financial Services Group, stated Alipay’s parent firm offers US ETF trading services. He expressed the firm was expected to advertise the BTC ETF. Yifan added the Chinese government would not be alarmed as long as traders could not illegally transact yuan out of the state. The CEO highlighted the recent ETF-related ads on Alipay were not direct offerings from the Ant group. He noted that the ads were published by a third party who had identified some loopholes on the platform. Yifan suggested that the ads were shortlived and did not indicate the Chinese government’s stance on cryptocurrencies. Industry figures predict China’s shift in cryptocurrencies stance Alipay declared its ban on BTC and other crypto-related transactions in 2019, complying with the Chinese government’s ban on cryptocurrencies two years earlier. The government has since introduced new measures to enforce the ban, such as interdepartmental coordination among various state agencies. However, despite the ban, a People’s Court in China published a report that indicated digital assets were still recognized as legal property in the state. The adverts have reportedly fueled more speculation in the crypto community on whether the Chinese government will likely lift its cryptocurrency ban. China-based crypto mining chip designer Nano Labs further fueled speculation after it announced on November 11 that it would accept Bitcoin as a mode of payment. In the announcement on a business account on Coinbase, the company stated that the stance was necessary in the ever-evolving digital economy. Galaxy Digital General Manager Mike Novogratz suggested that China would lift the crypto ban at the end of 2024. Zhao Changpeng supported these sentiments at the Bitcoin MENA conference in Abu Dhabi. He stated that the trend of building Bitcoin reserves is inevitable globally despite China’s uncertain stance on cryptocurrency. Changpeng noted that other countries will likely adopt the trend after the USA builds on BTC reserves. Former Chinese Finance Minister Lou Jiwei also emphasized that China needed to assess cryptocurrency developments during Beijing’s 2024 Tsinghua Wudaokou Chief Economists Forum. He urged the state to be keen on advancements, especially with the United States shifting its stance on Bitcoin ETFs Other players, however, remained skeptical of the likelihood of the Chinese government relaxing its stance on cryptocurrencies. For instance, Jack Wang noted in April that Hong Kong’s crypto exchange-traded funds would not have an impact on investors in mainland China. He noted that although the ETF issuers had close ties with mainland China, they could not provide Bitcoin or Ether exposure to Chinese investors due to the current ban.

Notably, the revelation last week has sparked intense debate, with prominent Bitcoin advocate Max Keiser suggesting that converting this newfound wealth into BTC could drive the cryptocurrency’s value to unprecedented heights. Taking to X on Thursday, Keiser underscored the urgency of acting swiftly. “Only profitable if they sell the gold today (at a suitable discount) and buy BTC now. Since Bitcoin is demonetizing gold (to effectively zero), the pool of potential future buyers of gold is rapidly shrinking, and without buyers, the mined gold would have no value,” he wrote. Keiser’s comments were in response to a speculative post by a follower suggesting that if Bukele used the gold reserves to purchase Bitcoin, its price could soar to $378,000 per coin, marking a potential 275% surge from current prices. Interestingly, Bukele appears open to this strategy. On December 9, he tweeted, “And we’ll dilute that thing like there’s no tomorrow,” hinting at plans to mine and sell the gold in exchange for Bitcoin. Notably, his administration has already moved to repeal mining bans, paving the way for large-scale extraction. Despite the enthusiasm among Bitcoin supporters, the proposal has drawn sharp criticism from those opposed to mining such an extensive gold reserve, who argue that it could result in severe ecological consequences and disrupt ecosystems and local communities. Critics also argue that prioritizing Bitcoin over gold, widely regarded as a stable store of value, could expose El Salvador to significant financial risks, given Bitcoin’s high volatility. El Salvador’s journey with Bitcoin began in 2021 when it became the first nation to adopt cryptocurrency as legal tender. Despite widespread international criticism from the IMF, Bukele has remained steadfast, steadily increasing the country’s Bitcoin reserves. As of December 12, these reserves were holding 6,184 BTC valued at just over $574 million, reflecting unrealized profits of around $176 million. That said, Keiser, known for his bullish predictions , has recently raised his Bitcoin price forecast to $2.2 million, citing growing confidence in Bitcoin’s potential to replace traditional reserve assets like gold. This sentiment echoes that of Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, who has long advocated for Bitcoin as a superior alternative to gold. If Bukele were to convert the $3 trillion in gold reserves into Bitcoin, it would create unparalleled buying pressure, potentially driving Bitcoin’s price to historic highs. While such a move could disrupt traditional financial systems, it would cement Bitcoin’s position as a dominant global asset.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/pundit-claims-bukeles-gold-to-bitcoin-move-would-skyrocket-btc-to-378000-heres-how/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

Pepe Loves Santa (PEPESAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Loves Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Loves Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Loves Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Loves Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Loves Santa by entering its contract address – 9FuN9o4pQgF3NF1v2saWvb7b9hNKDJ1DGU6LSbur437Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/pepe-loves-santa-pepesan-solana-memecoin-to-explode-over-19000-before-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The top family is reportedly valued at $406.5 billion, while the 25th name on the list has a wealth of $37.4 billion. According to Bloomberg’s list, The Walton family is at the forefront of the wealth rankings, with a staggering $172.7 billion boost in 2024, thanks to a surge in Walmart stock. The Waltons have a combined net worth of over $400 billion. Owning 46% of the retail giant, the family’s heirs continue to benefit from Sam Walton’s legacy. The family has diversified its portfolio into sectors like sports ownership, specifically the American Football franchise Denver Broncos. The 25 richest families in the world collectively gained $406.5 billion in wealth this year. Here’s who made the list https://t.co/KhDFyP8NUb — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) December 12, 2024 Second and third in the ranking were the generation dynasty Al Nahyan and the eighth-generation family Al Thani, valued at $323.9bn and $172.9bn, respectively. Other notable names on the list included the multiple industry investors of the Ofer family from Israel. Sammy Ofer, the founder of the shipping business where it all started, died in 2011. His assets were divided among his sons, Monaco-based Eyal and UK-based Idan. The sons now run distinct commercial firms in shipping, real estate, and energy and have a combined net worth of $55.6 billion Fidelity Investments, a key player in the wealth list, shifted its focus toward digital assets, including Bitcoin. The company, led by founder Edward C. Johnson II’s granddaughter and chief operating officer Abigail Johnson, ranked 11th on the list, amassing a wealth total of $72.4 billion. Family Bitcoin wealth – Fidelity Investments digital assets Fidelity Investments’ success can be attributed to its passion for integrating digital assets into traditional financial services through its branch, Fidelity Digital Assets. The company’s journey into crypto began as early as 2014 when it started researching blockchain technology and digital assets. By 2018, Fidelity Digital Assets had made history as the first major financial services firm to offer institutional clients bitcoin custody services. At the start of 2024, following immense pressure from the crypto community, Fidelity’s Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) application was approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), alongside 9 other filings. The startup’s FBTC ranks third in assets under management (AUM), behind IShares’s IBIT and Grayscale’s GBTC. Fidelity’s Bitcoin investment policies have certainly drawn interest and trust from the community. Market data shows FBTC had the largest inflows among spot BTC ETFs on December 11, recording a whopping $122 million, more than 50% of the total net inflows counted within the date.

Michael O’Reilly, president of Fidelity’s digital assets division, highlighted this private ownership structure as a strategic advantage for its crypto custody services. Speaking to Fortune News, O’Reilly explained that it enables the firm to adopt a long-term perspective in areas like cryptocurrency, which many competitors have avoided. “Being privately held gives us quite an advantage there,” he said. In other news, Fidelity’s spot Ethereum ETF has seen inflows exceeding $200 million within the past 48 hours. Per data from Arkham Intelligence, Fidelity’s FETH purchased $202.2 million worth of Ethereum on December 10, marking the ninth consecutive day of inflows, which now total over $645 million.

These assets represents advanced decentralized identity infrastructure in the world, having enabled thousands of developers to build user-controlled identity features into their applications. With this move, Dentity aims to strengthen its position as a global leader in decentralized identity. “Trinsic’s platform revolutionizes how consumers control and share their personal data,” said Jeff Schwartz, Founder and CEO of Dentity. “This acquisition brings us one step closer to creating a safer, more secure digital future, where individuals are fully in charge of their identity — and can potentially earn from it, not Big Tech.” Riley Hughes, co-founder of Trinsic, shared, “Dentity stands out as the most successful product built on our decentralized identity platform.

The Need for Digital Identity In a world where fraud, online scams, and identity theft are on the rise, digital identity offers a powerful solution. In fact, online grooming crimes have surged 89%, and romance scams are up 160%. This explosion of fraud highlights a major challenge — anonymity online is both a tool for bad actors and a barrier to trust. Decentralized identity is the key to unlocking trust online. It empowers consumers to securely share only what’s necessary, whether they’re buying, selling, dating, or participating in the growing Web3 economy. For the first time, individuals — not third parties — control their data, cutting out the middlemen who earns from consumer information. The Timing Consumers are increasingly dissatisfied with how their data is controlled by large tech companies. Over 75% of people don’t trust Big Tech with their personal information, and they’re demanding more control over their digital lives. Gartner predicts that by 2026, 500 million smartphone users will regularly use a digital identity wallet — a testament to the growing need for decentralized digital identity solutions. Combining Trinsic’s powerful identity technology with Dentity’s consumer apps and distribution channels accelerates the adoption of reusable, verified digital identities — helping to combat fraud, streamline online interactions, and give users the tools to manage their data. “The convergence of rising online fraud and consumer demand for more privacy-driven solutions makes this the perfect time for Dentity to scale,” stated Schwartz A Multi-Billion Dollar Opportunity The market for digital identity is projected to reach $325 billion by 2027, and with this acquisition, Dentity is uniquely positioned to capture its share. The acquisition not only unlocks new growth opportunities but also helps Dentity and its partners scale faster and reach a wider range of developers looking to integrate decentralized identity into their platforms. “The future of Web3 and digital identity is about empowering individuals, reducing online fraud, and making the internet a more trustworthy place. We’re building a future where digital trust is easy, secure, and owned by the individual.” About Dentity Dentity makes it easy for people to build and manage digital trust online.

37550553,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319027,1734020479,Solana Surges Past $230 – Is a $750 Price Target Now in Play?,"The price of Solana has risen to $231 today, rallying by 3% in the past 24 hours as the cryptocurrency market enjoys a similar gain. While SOL remains down by 4% in a week, it’s now up by 11.5% in a month and by 225% in the past year. Such gains are likely only the beginning, with Bitwise publishing bullish price predictions for 2025 yesterday, including a $750 target for Solana. This may be ambitious, but Solana’s momentum and the likely approach of SOL ETFs next year would suggest that it’s within the realms of possibility. Solana Surges Past $230 – Is a $750 Price Target Now in Play? Posting on X, Bitwise’s head of research, Ryan Rasmussen, predicted that Bitcoin (BTC) will reach $200,000 next year, while Coinbase’s growing market cap will push it into the S&P 500. Prediction #1: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana hit new all-time highs, with Bitcoin trading above $200k. Our targets: $200k BTC: Corp/gov buying, ETF flows, & 2024 halving $7k ETH: Growth in L2s, stablecoins, & tokenization $750 SOL: Memecoins & migration of “serious” projects pic.twitter.com/GfMkyGEGr0 — Ryan Rasmussen (@RasterlyRock) December 11, 2024 In the case of Solana, he predicted a top of $750, with his optimism stemming from the migration of serious projects and from ongoing meme coin usage. Solana’s network has continued to witness significant transaction numbers in recent weeks, with Solscan data showing that non-vote transactions have risen to almost 60 million per day in the past month. While this indicates a high degree of trading, it’s likely that it also points to rising use of the Solana network, including for the issuance of meme tokens. Indeed, DefiLlama data shows that Solana’s total value locked in has risen by 915% in the past 12 months, whereas SOL’s price alone has gained by 225%. As such, there are enough reasons to be optimistic about Solana, and with SOL-based ETFs becoming an increasing possibility once Trump takes office for a second time, the alt could see some real gains next year. Looking at the coin’s chart today, it has rebounded strongly after entering an oversold position yesterday, with its RSI (purple) remaining at around 60. Source: TradingView More bullishly, SOL’s 30-period moving average (orange) has risen very close to the 200-period (blue) and looks like it will climb over the longer term indicator, meaning that a breakout could be coming. Based on these technicals, and given Solana’s medium- and long-term momentum, it could reach $265 by the end of the year, before passing $300 within Q1 2025. New Meme Tokens Could Bring Faster Gains Solana has had a great 2024, but there’s no guarantee that it will perform quite as well next year, especially when it’s already so established. In case of underperformance, some traders may like to diversify into smaller cap tokens, which can often outperform market averages during their initial growth phases. One token shaping up to do well is Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) , an ERC-20 token that has raised an impressive $7.2 million in its recently launched presale. $7M raised. Over $2.5M in the last 24 hours The frog army is built different. pic.twitter.com/BEpsTozDgk — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) December 12, 2024 WEPE is attracting investors because it’s more than a no-utility meme token. Indeed, it comes with its very own trade intelligence platform, which will provide investors with real-time analysis and market insights. Not only that, but holding the WEPE token will grant users of Wall Street Pepe’s platform with exclusive buying signals and insider trading strategies. Its platform will have online community spaces and forums, where users can share tips and analysis, as well as compete in trading competitions. Winners of such competitions will earn rewards in WEPE, while the token will also be open to staking, earning holders additional income. Investors can join this exciting project’s sale by heading over to its official website ., where WEPE is available at a price of $0.000212. This will increase in just under four days, and numerous more times before the sale ends, so newcomers should act quickly.

37550609,184861,1734020443,Dentity Acquires Trinsic’s Decentralized ID Platform to Expand Adoption of Web3 Digital Identities,"Santa Monica, CA, December 12th, 2024, Chainwire The deal brings together industry leaders and sets the stage for the next era of decentralized digital identity Dentity is proud to announce the acquisition of Trinsic ’s decentralized identity assets, setting the stage for a dramatic expansion of Web3 identity solutions. These assets represents advanced decentralized identity infrastructure in the world, having enabled thousands of developers to build user-controlled identity features into their applications. With this move, Dentity aims to strengthen its position as a global leader in decentralized identity. “Trinsic’s platform revolutionizes how consumers control and share their personal data,” said Jeff Schwartz, Founder and CEO of Dentity. “This acquisition brings us one step closer to creating a safer, more secure digital future, where individuals are fully in charge of their identity — and can potentially earn from it, not Big Tech.” Riley Hughes, co-founder of Trinsic, shared, “Dentity stands out as the most successful product built on our decentralized identity platform. Their consumer scale and impressive ecosystem of partners will allow Trinsic’s technology to touch millions more, making Dentity the perfect place for this platform to reach its potential.” Dentity has joined Trinsic’s Identity Acceptance Network, which enables seamless identity verification through digital IDs in web3 wallets like Dentity, mobile driver’s licenses, and eID apps. Trinsic’s network gives 100 million consumers instant access to Dentity’s products and ecosystem partners. The Need for Digital Identity In a world where fraud, online scams, and identity theft are on the rise, digital identity offers a powerful solution. In fact, online grooming crimes have surged 89%, and romance scams are up 160%. This explosion of fraud highlights a major challenge — anonymity online is both a tool for bad actors and a barrier to trust. Decentralized identity is the key to unlocking trust online. It empowers consumers to securely share only what’s necessary, whether they’re buying, selling, dating, or participating in the growing Web3 economy. For the first time, individuals — not third parties — control their data, cutting out the middlemen who earns from consumer information. The Timing Consumers are increasingly dissatisfied with how their data is controlled by large tech companies. Over 75% of people don’t trust Big Tech with their personal information, and they’re demanding more control over their digital lives. Gartner predicts that by 2026, 500 million smartphone users will regularly use a digital identity wallet — a testament to the growing need for decentralized digital identity solutions.

37549638,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392480,1734020312,"BlackRock Suggests 1-2% Bitcoin Allocation in Portfolios, Comparing Its Risk Profile to Tech Giants","The post BlackRock Suggests 1-2% Bitcoin Allocation in Portfolios, Comparing Its Risk Profile to Tech Giants appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As per the latest Forbes report , a recent report by BlackRock titled ‘Sizing Bitcoin in Portfolios’, its analysts have noted that Bitcoin offers a risk profile similar to the Magnificent Seven firms like Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Nvidia, Meta, Google, and Microsoft. BTC Being Compared With The Magnificent 7! In the research report, analysts led by the CIO of ETF and Index products, Samara Cohen, noted that the $2 trillion cryptocurrency offers a similar risk profile to the Magnificent 7 firms, whose average market capitalization is $2.5 trillion and have accounted for nearly 35% of the S&P 500’s $46 trillion market capitalization. Analysts assert that the crypto should now account for 1% to 2% of traditional “60/40” investment portfolios. This would position the asset similarly to companies like Nvidia, Amazon, or Apple even though Bitcoin has little utility other than as a speculative asset, and it derives no revenues from products like corporate titans. BTC’s Low Correlation To Trad Markets The BlackRock report also pointed out bitcoin’s historically low correlation to traditional markets. While bitcoin was highly correlated to other asset classes, and tech stocks, during the COVID boom and bust, it started to diverge in June 2023. The report predicts this will continue due to global financial fragmentation, rising geopolitical tensions, distrust in banks, and increasing deficits. In their analysis, Cohen and her team discovered that a 1-2% allocation in a 60/40 portfolio yields a risk profile similar to that of a Magnificent 7 stock. A 1% weighting would contribute 2% of risk, while a 2% allocation increases the risk weighting to 5%. Another doubling in the weighting to 4% would account for an exponentially higher 14% of overall risk, according to the report. Future Gains Maybe Harder Though Blackrock only recommends a maximum of 2% as appropriate for most investors, it also indicated that future price gains may be more difficult. “The return characteristics are likely to change significantly once we reach a target state where potentially the portfolio allocation is much more tactical like gold and is used for hedging with a very different set of characteristics,” remarked Cohen.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | RESEARCH,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/blackrock-suggests-1-2-bitcoin-allocation-in-portfolios-comparing-its-risk-profile-to-tech-giants/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37549611,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374510,1734020281,Bitcoin ETFs Hit $50.5B in Cumulative Net Inflows in First Year,"Nearly a year since United States-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were launched in January, the funds have experienced remarkable growth. Inflows into the 12 funds have surpassed 500,000 BTC. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Attract Over 500K BTC In an X post , Vetle Lunde, head of Research at the digital assets research firm K33, stated that spot bitcoin ETFs currently have 500,925 BTC in cumulative net inflows, worth over $50.5 billion at today’s price. Notably, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) had achieved this milestone earlier . The fund became the fastest ETF in history to exceed $50 billion in asset under management (AUM), a feat it achieved in 228 days, beating the previous record of 1,329 days. However, since Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust had mostly recorded negative flows, the cumulative net inflows into the 12 US spot bitcoin ETFs took longer to hit the 500,000 BTC milestone. Lunde added, “U.S. ETFs have absorbed more than 2.5% of the circulating supply since their launch in January.” According to data from CoinMarketCap, bitcoin’s circulating supply currently stands at 19.7 million BTC, with a supply cap of 21 million BTC. Bitcoin ETFs Extend Inflow Streak Amid Soaring Price The funds have been on an inflow streak over the past two weeks, with Wednesday being the 10th consecutive day of inflows. Net inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs on Wednesday totaled $223 million, according to data from SoSo Value. Fidelity’s FBTC led the inflows with $121.9 million in fresh investment. GBTC and ARKB recorded $52.27 and $20.13 inflows respectively. BlackRock’s IBIT, however, maintained neutral flows. Per the data, total net inflows into the 12 US spot BTC ETFs amounted to $34.58 billion. Growing institutional interest in bitcoin has significantly contributed to the sustained inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs. The latest inflows coincided with the recent BTC rally, which saw the top cryptocurrency trading above $100k. BTC is trading at $100,879 at press time.

Trump, the President-elect of the United States, has been named TIME magazine’s Person of the Year for 2024, marking the second time he has received the honor. DJT first earned the title in 2016 following his initial presidential election victory. TIME’s editor-in-chief, Sam Jacobs, announced Trump as the Person of the Year on Thursday morning, with the President-elect in attendance. Jacobs gave a statement on Trump’s victory, which was published in the magazine, saying it was an obvious choice. “On the cusp of his second presidency, all of us, from his most fanatical supporters to his most fervent critics, are living in the Age of Trump,” Jacobs wrote. Jacobs further elaborated that DJT was selected for his influence on global news throughout 2024. “ This is someone who made a historic comeback, reshaped the American presidency, and is reordering American politics, ” he said. “ It’s hard to argue with the fact that the person moving into the Oval Office is the most influential figure in the news. ” Following his selection as Person of the Year, DJT rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). It was his first time ringing the bell, and he expressed his satisfaction with the recognition. “ TIME Magazine, getting this honor for the second time, I think I like it better this time actually, ” he remarked. Trump talks about campaign strategy and his administration’s plans Before the trading day began, Trump took the chance to tout his incoming administration’s plans and appointments, including naming Scott Bessent as Secretary of the Treasury. He also pledged to expedite federal permits, including environmental approvals, for infrastructure and construction projects exceeding $1 billion in value. “ I think we’re going to have a tremendous run ,” he said. “ We have to straighten out some problems, some big problems in the world .” The president-elect was also asked about his plans for crypto by CNBC’s correspondent Jim Cramer, to which he responded, “ We’re gonna do something great with crypto. We don’t want China, or anybody else – others are embracing it, and we want to be the head. ” In an interview with TIME, Trump reflected on his campaign’s final stretch leading up to his election win, describing it as ‘72 Days of Fury.’ “ We hit the nerve of the country. The country was angry, ” he said, suggesting his approach resonated with voters and ultimately secured his return to the White House. President-elect Donald J. Trump is named TIME Person of the Year. Tune in for live his address from NYSE. @realDonaldTrump | @TIME | #NYSE https://t.co/OLrJgcJbl5 — NYSE 🏛 (@NYSE) December 12, 2024 The day’s activities, including Trump’s presence on Wall Street to ceremonially start trading, had been kept under wraps until Thursday morning. Trump’s tumultuous relationship with TIME magazine has also resurfaced amid the honor. After being named Person of the Year in 2016, he praised the publication as “very important” and called the title a “tremendous honor.” However, during his first term as president, Trump frequently criticized the media, including TIME, accusing outlets of biased reporting. Eric Trump: US President-elect is the most pro-crypto leader in America’s history While Trump’s political resurgence continues to make headlines, his family has been actively molding relationships with other countries. As reported by the New York Times, Eric Trump, the President-elect’s son, headlined the Bitcoin MENA 2024 conference in the United Arab Emirates this week, where he addressed thousands of attendees. He emphasized the family’s support for the crypto industry, describing efforts to align government policies with business interests. “You’re going to have the most pro-crypto president in the history of America,” Eric Trump declared. “ Think about a president who isn’t going to allow Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to be overregulated and stifled. ” Eric Trump’s announcement coincided with Bitcoin reaching a milestone price of $100,000, an achievement he claimed to have celebrated with his father. The younger Trump’s remarks also revealed a shift in the family’s approach to business and governance. During Donald Trump’s first term as president, the family had pledged to maintain a clear separation between business operations and government roles. However, Eric Trump’s comments suggested a more open acknowledgment of overlapping interests in the upcoming administration. At the conference, he promoted the family’s latest venture, World Liberty Financial , a crypto platform. His statements signaled a reduced concern about potential conflicts of interest, as he openly linked the President-elect’s policies to the family’s financial ventures.

37550552,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319072,1734019503,Bitcoin to Soar in 2025? Sygnum Bank Predicts Institutional Investment Surge,"Bitcoin ( BTC ) could experience significant price increases in 2025, driven by a surge in institutional investment, according to a new report from Switzerland-based crypto-focused asset manager Sygnum Bank. The report, titled “Crypto Market Outlook 2025” and released on Dec. 12, highlights the confluence of several factors contributing to this potential upswing. Bitcoin’s Scarcity Drives Institutional Demand and Price Volatility Traditional institutional investors, such as pension and sovereign wealth funds, are beginning to allocate capital to crypto assets. Their increased participation could trigger substantial demand. This institutional demand is met with a minimal supply of Bitcoin , especially considering a significant portion is held by long-term investors and rarely traded. This scarcity amplifies the impact of any investment, potentially leading to substantial price appreciation as demand increases. Bitcoin price vs. Bitcoin ETF cumulative net flows. Source: Sygnum Crypto Market Outlook 2025 Sygnum’s analysis of Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) investments reveals interesting trends. The effect on Bitcoin’s price varies when $1 billion flows into these ETFs (representing about 0.1% of Bitcoin’s total value). Smaller investments of $3.5 to $4.5 billion mid-year caused 3-4% price changes for every $1 billion invested. More significant investments of $11 to $12 billion, made earlier this year and recently, led to more substantial price swings of 4.5 to 6% per $1 billion. “Accounting for the estimated inflows into spot Bitcoin indicated by increases in stablecoin market capitalization, we estimate a 20-30x multiplier on every US dollar of inflow, with the multiplier increasing with the size of the flows,” Sygnum expects, adding: “As institutional inflows accelerate, coupled with the multiplier effect and Bitcoin’s reflexivity, this is likely to lead to another year of very strong performance for Bitcoin.” Positive Political Climate Fuels Institutional Demand The growing institutional demand is further supported by a favorable political climate, particularly in the U.S., where the incoming administration has signaled a positive stance on crypto and potential regulatory reforms. BRICS countries are also softening their stance on crypto. Russia is actively encouraging the use of cryptocurrencies in transactions, while there are signs that China ’s crypto ban may be relaxed, as per the report. Signum analysts estimate that “major transitions in the economic order are likely to be marred by periods of uncertainty and risk, increasing the demand for safe-haven assets and alternative payment mechanisms.” They find it unsurprising that gold prices have reached repeated all-time highs all year, with the silver price increasing in tandem. “This has increased the demand for Bitcoin as well, with US plans for a Bitcoin reserve now giving further impetus to the already ongoing diversification from precious metals to Bitcoin.” Potential Risks and Challenges on the Horizon The Sygnum report also paints a picture of 2025 as a potential “watershed year” for the crypto industry, with institutional investment in digital assets becoming normalized, regulatory clarity emerging, and the use of stablecoins and tokenized assets entering the mainstream. However, despite the optimistic outlook, the report acknowledges potential challenges hindering the crypto market’s progress. These include macroeconomic factors like inflation, which has been stickier than hoped at 2.1%. Potential instability in the macro environment could also cause a sell-off in risk assets, as the report states: “Although a bear market in risk assets can also lead to a rotation into crypto from other assets, based on past track record, a “sell everything” approach is more likely.” Another concern is the concentrated risk associated with Tether’s ( USDT ) dominance in the stablecoin market . After the 2023 US banking crisis, Tether’s previous 45-50% dominance has increased to 75%. Tether’s dominance has increased to 75% in 2024. Source: Sygnum Crypto Market Outlook 2025 The possibility of a speculative bubble in the meme coin market also poses a risk. Sygnum notes that “excessive exuberance [of meme coins] can transform a fundamentally driven bull market into a bubble.” Finally, the ever-present threat of geopolitical tensions, like events in the Middle East and Ukraine, could also impact the market. The report states that “in the current environment of extraordinary geopolitical tensions, these risks to the market cannot be ignored. However, the report concludes that Bitcoin accumulation will likely continue. The post Bitcoin to Soar in 2025?

Next 100x Meme Coin","its presale, owing to its unique combination of memability and utility. The WEPE presale has already raised approximately $7.5 million in just a few weeks amid heavy bidding from retailers and smart money investors alike. Given the fact that this microcap token will launch in 2025 during the highly-anticipated “supercycle”, a few prominent investors are even calling it the next 100x meme coin. Pepe The Frog Meets Wolf Of The Wall Street As previously stated, Wall Street Pepe isn’t behind any project when it comes to memability. As such, Pepe The Frog remains one of the most iconic characters in the meme coin sector. Experts believe that Pepe (PEPE) could even reach a $50 billion market cap, largely due to its popularity on the internet. However, Wall Street Pepe isn’t an ordinary frog. Its whitepaper suggests that it is inspired by the ruthless trading style shown in Wolf Of The Wall Street. However, it also doesn’t just rely on its memability and hype for its success, drawing a stark contrast from most new meme coins. Instead, it aims to challenge the market manipulation of whales and insiders and is attempting to secure a level playing field for small-scale retail investors. The project will soon launch an exclusive VIP group for its holders, offering trading strategies, alpha calls and market insights. The WEPE army may very well be able to find the next 100x meme coin in this group, perhaps even earlier than the whales. Moreover, WEPE holders can even publish their own trading set-ups and those with a high success rate will win attractive monetary rewards. In fact, 15% of the WEPE token supply has been reserved for trading awards. Wall Street Pepe has also launched a native staking protocol, which is currently offering two-digit APY rewards. Between the VIP “alpha-calls” group, trading rewards and staking rewards, Wall Street Pepe could present one of the best avenues for small-scale retail investors to reap outsized returns in the coming bull market. Is WEPE The Next 100x Meme Coin? Aside from the attractive monetary perks, Wall Street Pepe is also a meme coin with strong fundamentals. For instance, the project has community-centric tokenomics. Nearly 50% of the token supply has been set aside for the investors, split between the presale, trading rewards and staking rewards. 38% of the tokens have also been reserved for the marketing budget, ensuring that WEPE grabs the maximum eyeballs during the bull market. Most importantly, there is no separate allocation for the developer team or any private sale, which significantly reduces the likelihood of a rug-pull. Wall Street Pepe also has a transparent roadmap, a public smart contract audit which did not reveal any security or centralization risks and popular social media accounts. Unsurprisingly, the new meme coin has impressed smart money investors and crypto influencers. As previously stated, a few experts are even calling WEPE the next 100x meme coin. However, only early presale buyers will be able to earn the maximum returns. The WEPE price is already climbing rapidly due to the high demand during its presale. Interested buyers can visit the Wall Street Pepe website, use the over-the-counter widget and buy the meme coin with just a few clicks. They are also advised to follow its X or Telegram account for the latest updates. Visit Wall Street Pepe Presale Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

According to a recent report by Ukrainska Pravda , the proposed legislation, developed with input from the National Bank and the International Monetary Fund, outlines a taxation framework for crypto similar to securities. Ukraine to Legalize Crypto in Q1 2025 The announcement was made by Danylo Hetmantsev, Head of the Ukrainian Parliament Committee for Finances, Tax, and Customs Policy, during the Domestic Investment Opportunities forum hosted by Ekonomichna Pravda. “If we’re talking about cryptocurrency, the [parliament’s] working group is finalising a draft law for its first reading. I believe the text, developed in collaboration with the National Bank and the IMF, will be ready after the New Year,” said Hetmantsev. “We aim to pass this law and legalize cryptocurrency in the [2025’s] first quarter,” stated Hetmantsev. Donald Trump is TIME's Person of the Year pic.twitter.com/ONhK1M43EV — Ukrainska Pravda in English (@pravda_eng) December 12, 2024 Hetmantsev emphasized that crypto transactions in Ukraine will not benefit from tax exemptions. Instead, the taxation framework will mirror that applied to securities, with profits taxed only when digital assets are converted into fiat currency. He highlighted that consultations with European experts and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) influenced this decision, aiming to prevent potential tax evasion in conventional financial markets through careful regulatory measures. El Salvador to Revise Bitcoin Policy for IMF Loan The IMF played a central role in shaping El Salvador ’s decision to revise its Bitcoin policy. As part of the conditions for a $1.3 billion loan agreement, it has pressed for the removal of mandatory Bitcoin acceptance in the country, citing concerns over financial stability. IMF representatives have consistently opposed the 2021 law that established Bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador, arguing that it poses risks to the nation’s financial integrity. The agreement, which is still under discussion, is expected to unlock further international funding.

Though it has dropped in the past week and month, it’s up over 270% in the last six months. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 30, indicating it may be oversold and could rebound soon. If Popcat moves past the nearby resistance at $1.90, it might reach the next level at $2.41, which is a significant increase from the current price.

Trading between $0.0080 and $0.0132, it’s approaching a key resistance at $0.0152. Indicators suggest it’s oversold, pointing to potential upward movement. If it breaks above the 10-day average price, we might see it rise towards the next resistance around $0.0203. This could mean significant gains from current levels. With altcoin season on the horizon, Turbo could be gearing up for a strong bullish run. Conclusion While POPCAT and TURBO show potential, their short-term gains may be limited. DOGEN is crafted for those pursuing luxury and success, aiming for 700% growth by presale’s end and possible thousand-fold returns this altcoin season. Following successful tokens like BONK and WIF, DOGEN builds a community of market leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks to early supporters.

37549150,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=661341,1734019202,Dogecoin Whales Bought 210 million DOGE During Recent Correction – Bullish Signal?,"Dogecoin has seen choppy price action over the past few weeks, reflecting the broader market’s indecision. After reaching a new yearly high of $0.484, the price retraced sharply, losing over 25% of its value. This pullback has left Dogecoin struggling to regain strength and find clear direction, creating uncertainty among retail investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Finds Support At $94.5K As STH Realized Prize Signals Strength Despite the retrace, on-chain data provides a promising signal for Dogecoin’s potential recovery. Metrics from Santiment reveal that Dogecoin whales took advantage of the recent dip, accumulating a staggering 210 million DOGE during the correction. This accumulation suggests that large holders position themselves for higher prices, signaling confidence in Dogecoin’s long-term outlook. The market is watching closely to see if this whale activity can reignite momentum and push Dogecoin back toward its highs. With whales accumulating during the correction, recovery might be on the horizon, but the price still needs to reclaim key resistance levels to confirm a bullish continuation. Investors and analysts are awaiting the next move, which could determine whether Dogecoin remains in a consolidation phase or resumes its upward trend. Finding Fuel To Rally Dogecoin has been a standout performer recently, experiencing a massive surge since November 5. The meme coin gained over 220% during this period, capturing the attention of retail and institutional investors alike. However, after this impressive rally, Dogecoin is now in a consolidation phase, as the market takes a pause before the next significant move. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared insights on X, highlighting on-chain data from Santiment that offers a bullish perspective. According to Martinez, Dogecoin whales took advantage of the recent price correction, accumulating an impressive 210 million DOGE. This activity underscores the growing interest in ‘smart money’, as large holders often accumulate during dips in anticipation of future price increases. Such whale activity is a positive long-term signal for Dogecoin and meme coins, suggesting confidence in its potential for further growth. Related Reading: Solana Will ‘Step Back Into The Spotlight’ Once It Reclaims $222 – Details Despite the bullish signals, Dogecoin must overcome current consolidation to maintain its upward trajectory. A breakout above the current pattern would likely trigger another surge, continuing its rally. However, failure to break out could lead to a deeper correction as investors reassess short-term market conditions. The next move will likely set the tone for Dogecoin’s direction in the coming weeks, making it a critical moment for the popular meme coin. Dogecoin Testing Crucial Demand Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at $0.41 after successfully testing support at the $0.36 level, a critical area that has held firm during recent market volatility. Over the past few days, DOGE has been ranging sideways, confined between resistance at $0.48 and support at $0.36. This range-bound activity suggests the market is in a consolidation phase, with both bulls and bears waiting for the next decisive move. If Dogecoin can break above the key resistance level at $0.48, it would signal renewed bullish momentum and likely trigger a push higher. Such a breakout could attract more buyers and set the stage for DOGE to challenge its previous highs. On the other hand, failure to hold the $0.36 support level would likely lead to a deeper correction, with the potential to test lower demand zones as investors lose confidence in the short-term outlook.

The meme coin sits at a crossroads, poised for its next big move.

XRP price rallied 5%, boosted by NYDFS stablecoin approval. SEC emergency meeting sparks XRP lawsuit settlement speculations. Ripple Labs recently transferred 380 million XRP, valued at $915 million, to an undisclosed wallet, raising speculation across the crypto community. The transaction coincided with a 5% increase in XRP’s price, driven by Ripple’s significant regulatory milestone—the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) approval of its stablecoin, RLUSD. Market analysts have offered varied takes on this move. While some suggest it could be an internal reallocation, others view it as a precursor to a potential sell-off. This comes as Ripple achieves a critical step toward launching RLUSD, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed the approval on December 10th, calling it a major advancement for the company. In effect, the approval allows Ripple to list RLUSD on major exchanges and partner platforms, including Uphold, Bitstamp, Bitso, MoonPay, Independent Reserve, CoinMENA, and Bullish.

To read full editions, subscribe . When Cobie was tweeting about his pyramid-shaped philosophy on building the perfect crypto portfolio — you listened. Maybe you even saw the benefit of spreading your capital across bitcoin, ether and solana in a 50/35/15 split . Depending on the execution, those strategies would’ve easily paid off during the bull market to date. It still probably hurts to know that they’ve been blown out of the water by Milady and Pudgy NFTs. USD-denominated floor prices for both NFT collections have now gone more than 20x since December 2022. The cheapest Miladys went for the ETH equivalent of $890 back then — today they go for $22,570. At the same time, Pudgys have exploded from $5,070 to $106,900. Floor Pudgys are now technically more expensive than bitcoin, although with far less supply. BTC has meanwhile managed around 6x and ETH 3x, while SOL is currently at 18.5x. Then again, you can’t buy stuffed collectible bitcoins at Walmart. Of course, NFT markets are far smaller and less liquid than major coins. They tend to undergo outsized pumps when volume suddenly picks up. Most of the gains have come in the past month or so: There were only about 1,000 Pudgy trades in the past week and 1,900 in the past month. 400 and 1,240 for Miladys . In any case, there’s no denying that floor Miladys and Pudgys are now two of the best-performing crypto assets in this bull market. Only one top-25 coin has outperformed them: PEPE. As you can see, Miladys and Pudgys are outliers Floor prices for Azuki, Doodles and CryptoPunks have still more than doubled, but that’s less than most major coins excluding LTC and DOT. Bored Apes and Nouns have even lost value against the US dollar. Still, if you were searching for indicators of how silly the next bull market phase could get, look no further.

37549007,https://crypto.news/?p=14318861,1734018983,Pepe Unchained forecast: PEPU captures 50% of PEPE trading volume post-listing,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Pepe Unchained surges 145% post-launch, capturing 50% of Pepe’s trading volume with its smart blockchain ecosystem. Table of Contents Pepe Unchained volume soars, trends on DEXScreener The meme coin with its own blockchain Soon to be listed on Tier-1 exchanges Can PEPU hit $1? Fred crypto says so How to claim and buy Pepe Unchained Pepe Unchained (PEPU) is off to a blistering start after launching on decentralized exchanges. On its first day, it has jumped 145% to a $180 million market cap. Its on-chain trading volume now sits at 50% of Pepe’s on-chain volume, showing early signs that this is a legitimate rival. But how far can it go? Pepe Unchained volume soars, trends on DEXScreener A well-known axiom in crypto is that ‘volume precedes price.’ If that’s the case, then PEPU has an exciting future in store. After enjoying the biggest presale of 2024, which raised $24 million, the project hit a homerun exchange launch, with its price soaring 145% so far. And with trading volume also rising, Pepe Unchained’s uptrend shows no signs of slowing down. Currently, Pepe Unchained’s trading volume is $21.5 million. Meanwhile, Pepe’s on-chain trading volume sits at just $41 million, which is a highly bullish sign for Pepe Unchained since its market cap is a fraction of Pepe’s. Its high trading volume also confirms a huge market appeal, meaning buyers are likely to flood in as PEPU lists on centralized exchanges. We can also see this market appeal on the on-chain analytics platform DEXSreener , on which Pepe Unchained is currently the number one trending token. The meme coin with its own blockchain We cannot understate the importance of Pepe Unchained’s use case, attaining to its potential for price appreciation. Pepe has a $9.5 billion market cap, and Dogecoin has a $57 billion market cap, yet neither have utility. On the contrary, Pepe Unchained is building an entire ecosystem. Yes, it rides the Pepe coin hype wave, but it does a lot more than that. It’s launching the first Pepe-themed Ethereum layer 2 blockchain, which will be 100x faster and far cheaper than the main network. It will also include features such as a no-code meme coin launchpad, staking, a block explorer, a dedicated Ethereum bridge, and more. Thanks to the Pepe Pump Pad, Pepe Unchained could transform into a thriving ecosystem within days, and the PEPU token is at the heart of it all. Soon to be listed on Tier-1 exchanges As mentioned, Pepe Unchained is getting exchange listings, and its strong trading volume indicates that investors will be lining up to buy it. Typically, centralized exchange listings have a significantly positive impact on price action. For instance, Peanut the Squirrel became the fastest meme coin to reach a $2 billion market cap after listing on Binance last month. It remains to be seen whether Binance, Coinbase, or potentially Robinhood will list PEPU first. Yet, one thing is for certain, whichever exchange wins listing rights will have its hands full as on-platform trading activity for this viral token soars. Can PEPU hit $1? Fred crypto says so With all of this in mind, it’s no wonder that high-profile traders are tipping Pepe Unchained for big gains. Austin Hilton reminded his 350k YouTube subscribers that he has been backing PEPU since day one and believes its success will only get stronger in the coming months. Just before the presale close, Fred Crypto said that PEPU could 90x. Based on its current price of $0.01295, that could take PEPU beyond to $1.1655. This would give a 48x gain from its current price. Meanwhile, analysts from ICOBench predicted Pepe Unchained could reach a more modest estimate of $0.135 by the end of 2025. Indeed, this prediction was published before Pepe Unchained’s emphatic presale launch. Given its out-of-the-gate success, analysts are no doubt looking further ahead now. With that, our Pepe Unchained price prediction targets a potential low of $0.135 and a potential high of $1.1655 by the end of 2025. Currently, Pepe Unchained has a market cap of 1.9% the size of Pepe’s. It will be interesting to see how the market adjusts to a new Pepe alternative with its own blockchain. While Pepe Unchained has surged 145% today, Pepe has decreased by 6.6%. How to claim and buy Pepe Unchained With Pepe Unchained’s ICO over, presale participants can claim their tokens from the Pepe Unchained website. And those yet to buy, can do so via the DEX widget on the project’s website, or using Uniswap or Best Wallet . Follow Pepe Unchained on X or join its Telegram for updates.

37550550,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319067,1734018961,CoinShares Predicts Positive Crypto Market Outlook in 2025,"European crypto investment firm CoinShares has unveiled its market predictions for 2025, outlining key trends likely to shape the industry. The report highlights a favorable regulatory landscape under the incoming Trump administration, the rapid adoption of Bitcoin ETFs, the emergence of Bitcoin-yielding companies, and notable innovations across Ethereum and Solana networks. Coinshares Predictions In the “Outlook—2025” report , CoinShares forecasts significant regulatory developments in the U.S. as Donald Trump returns to the presidency. ​​ https://twitter.com/coinwaft/status/1867182030561128864 Analyst Max Shannon predicts that regulatory overhaul and increased support for Bitcoin miners could foster a thriving environment for digital assets in 2025. Despite Bitcoin’s sustained momentum, Shannon expects altcoins to outperform the leading cryptocurrency due to a shift in market dynamics under the new administration. “As the U.S. shifts towards these policies, altcoins are likely to outperform Bitcoin, despite the latter still potentially being one of the best-performing assets in 2025,” Shannon wrote in the report. Miners solely focused on Bitcoin are expected to surpass those diversifying into other revenue streams like AI and machine manufacturing. This further reinforces the dominance of Bitcoin in the mining sector. CoinShares underscores the meteoric rise of Bitcoin ETFs , which saw massive inflows throughout 2024. The top four ETFs – BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, Fidelity Bitcoin ETF, Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, and Bitwise Bitcoin ETF – now collectively hold nearly 1 million BTC. This is close to the holdings of Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, estimated at 1.1 million coins. Moreover, the growth trajectory of Bitcoin ETFs in their first year outpaced gold ETFs , which took five years to achieve similar inflows. With institutional adoption still in its infancy, only 20% of assets under management in Bitcoin ETFs are held by professional firms. CoinShares sees significant potential for further growth in 2025. The emergence of Bitcoin-yielding companies is another trend to watch in 2025. These businesses leverage Bitcoin treasury reserves to generate value through yield farming, shareholding growth, or derivative income strategies. Bitcoin-yielding companies/Source: Coinshares Report MicroStrategy exemplifies this idea with its “BTC Yield” metric, measuring Bitcoin acquisitions’ contribution to shareholder value. The firm reported a 26.4% increase in its BTC yield from January to November 2024. CoinShares analyst Satish Patel believes this strategy will drive broader adoption of Bitcoin as a treasury asset in 2025. Ethereum Layer 2 Growth, Solana Network Upgrade Anticipation Ahead of 2025 According to Coinshares predictions, Ethereum is poised for further Layer 2 adoption as major corporations, including Sony and Kraken, expand their blockchain operations. Analyst Luke Nolan notes that Layer 2 ecosystems will drive increased demand for Ethereum transactions and associated fee structures. Ethereum Layer 2’s Daily Transaction/Source: Coinshares report The anticipated Pectra upgrade in 2025 promises enhanced network efficiency. However, it also presents challenges in balancing usability with value accrual for ETH. Similarly, Solana’s development roadmap showcases upgrades through Firedancer , a validator client designed to improve scalability and performance. Frankendancer, a hybrid client integrating Firedancer’s components, ensures stability during the transition. These upgrades aim to address throughput bottlenecks and elevate protocol standards, setting Solana on a path toward greater adoption in 2025.

While the general mood in crypto markets illustrates that another round of bull is coming, investors are asking themselves whether SHIB can achieve this insane ambition once again. With a market cap of $18.3 billion, Shiba Inu is trading around $0.0000311 and as such, hopes to perform well in the marketplace. As per the technical analysis, the 200-day SMA is expected to center at $0.00002215 and the 50-day at $0.00003371 as of January 7th, 2025. From the latest data, Shiba is pegged to be over $0.00002624, while the RSI 69.57 shows Shiba gained enough volume but is gradually nearing an overbought region. May we ask the most pressing question—can Shiba Inu stage a rally once again? Shiba Inu's Ecosystem and Future Potential Shiba Inu’s ecosystem and premise have improved quite significantly since its boom in 2021. The token also incorporates Shibarium, its layer-2 protocol designed to tackle high gas prices and low transaction rates. This has further increased the demand for the SHIB token as it can now be used for Dapps and smart contracts. Alongside this, SHIB’s burning mechanism continues to gradually choke the maximum supply, thereby increasing overall scarcity and, in turn, driving prices as well. In light of all these developments, replicating a 1,250x rally seems rather difficult. This is due to SHIB already ranking low on the cryptocurrency scale, making that level of market cap virtually impossible to achieve. However, predictions suggest only two more breaks at $0.00003371 and $0.000035, and the price is bound to rise 10x in two shorter time frames. Shiba Inu may be considered a speculative investment, but the community's enthusiasm towards the asset and its new initiatives can enable a larger return on investment in the next bull cycle. Rexas Finance (RXS): Targeting Transformative Growth There is an appeal for Shiba Inu due to the huge gains it can lead to, but Rexas Finance (RXS) is a more sound investment, bearing its own growth potential. This comes with the benefit of a true use case, unlike SHIB, which is largely meme-based. At the same time, RXS is focused on asset tokenization that allows any user to invest in fractions of highly valued assets, including real estate, fine arts, and commodities. Rexas Finance has sold over 324 million tokens in its presale across nine stages and raised over $25 million. RXS started its ninth stage at $0.125 and is set to launch on exchanges for $0.20, giving early investors 60% returns. Analysts expect this to be a low estimate since predictions suggest it could go up to $5–6 by the end of 2025, given its ecosystem and adoption. Rexas Estate: Assists in the fractional ownership of real estate. Rexas Token Builder: Supports businesses and developers by simplifying token creation. Rexas GenAI: Focuses more on creative NFTs and other projects that require artificial intelligence. Rexas Treasury: Maximizes token holders’ yield. These features make Rexas Finance a strong alternative to other forms of tokenization, creating interest from both individual and institutional investors. Security and Visibility The platform is Certik audited to provide a secure and transparent user environment. Being in presence and listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko further add to its credibility. Short-Term and Long-Term Predictions RXS will likely appreciate in value in Q1 of 2025 when it is listed on exchanges. Analysts predict the RXS token could sell between $0.70 and $0.80 in Q1 2025 as increased interest and usage emerge. One more thing to consider for this prediction is that by the close of 2025, it could surpass all mid-tier expectations with price estimates of $5–6 per RXS token. Predictions also suggest RXS could cost $125 per token in the next few years, as it showcases futuristic innovations, gains backing from prominent partnerships, and achieves global usage. Conclusion SHIB achieved some remarkable milestones in the world of cryptocurrency, but it remains to be seen if it can accomplish the same feat again. But if you’re an investor looking for a life-changing gain, then Rexas Finance is the one to bet on. Due to the tokenization of assets, the implementation of innovative ideas, and strong security features, RXS combines utility and growth prospects. Its successful presale and potential in both short—and long-term forecasts appeal to investors as the next crypto bull cycle approaches. Placing bets on SHIB, RXS, or both presents tremendous opportunities in this market, and making moves early may prove rewarding.

Starboard has been pushing Riot to convert some of its bitcoin mining sites into data centers that can host machines to enable high-performance computing (HPC) for big tech companies, according to the story. Riot is currently a ""pure-play"" bitcoin miner that gets its revenue only from mining bitcoin, as opposed to some other peers, such as Core Scientific (CORZ), which has dedicated a significant amount of its facilities to HPC and artificial intelligence computing.  “Riot regularly speaks with our shareholders and values their feedback,"" a spokesperson for the firm told CoinDesk in an emailed statement. ""We have engaged with Starboard on multiple occasions and welcome their input on the company. We are committed to creating value for all shareholders, and we look forward to constructive dialogue with Starboard on ways to achieve this shared goal.""  For many years, publicly traded mining companies were considered one of the main ways for institutional investors to get exposure to bitcoin. This was good for their stock prices, which soared during the 2020-21 bull market. The 2022 crypto winter, though, decimated the sector and most of the names haven't come anywhere close to recovering the previous bull market highs even though bitcoin has soared past $100,000.  The industry has faced an intense profit squeeze following the bitcoin halving earlier this year (which slashed mining profitability), leading some miners to look for ways to diversify their revenue sources. Still, nothing was a game change until Core Scientific signed a multi-billion dollar deal with a hyperscaler— a firm operating large-scale data centers for cloud computing and AI. This changed the sentiment and brought large investors back into the sector.   However, some firms, including Riot, remained pure-play miners, largely ignoring the trend of turning some of their sites into HPC computing. This, in turn, led to their underperformance relative to others in the industry. Starboard's move would mark the first time a traditional activist investor is taking a position in a publicly traded miner to push them to diversify their revenue into data centers.    Riot hasn't been completely opposed to this trend, as its CEO Jason Les has said that the company has been considering deals with these large tech companies. However, it hasn't announced anything so far that would suggest a potential deal is in the works, while other miners forge ahead with AI and HPC deals.   Most recently, Michael Novogratz's Galaxy Digital said it signed a non-binding deal with a U.S.-based hyperscaler firm to turn all its 800 megawatts of mining capacity into hosting high-performance computers. Meanwhile, bitcoin miner IREN (IREN) saw its shares surge after saying it had received interest from a trillion-dollar hyperscaler firm and Hut 8 (HUT) was speculated to have been building a data center with Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META).  Riot's stock rose as much as 11% in early Thursday trading and were higher by 6% at press time. The shares have fallen nearly 30% this year, while CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI) rose 40%.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/12/12/activist-investor-starboard-has-built-stake-in-bitcoin-miner-riot-wsj,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/295d5f58adf511c81ea269633f67967dee7ee0c7-1466x1100.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a whale transaction tracker on X (formerly Twitter), significant accumulation has been reported, ranging from wallet-linked Trump to whales. Whales and Institutions Rising Interest in LINK During the Asian trading hours, Eyesonchain , a blockchain-based transaction tracker made a post on X that Trump’s World Liberty Financial acquired a significant 41,335 LINK, worth $1 million. This notable purchase was made at an average price of $24.19. Additionally, another blockchain-based transaction tracker Lookonchain made a post on X that a whale had invested a substantial 1,263 ETH worth $4.95 million to acquire 175,424 LINK tokens at an average price of $28.18 level. Chainlink (LINK) Open Interest Reaches All-Time High These two substantial acquisitions in less than 12 hours have gained widespread attention from the crypto community, resulting in a record jump in price and future open interest (OI). According to the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode , LINK’s price has jumped to its highest level in the past two years, while its future OI has reached an all-time high of $770.27 million.

During the same period, its trading volume jumped by 65%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors amid ongoing whales and institutions participation. Chainlink (LINK) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, LINK is currently facing strong resistance near $29 and is attempting to breach this level. With significant institutional interest, crypto whales, and trader confidence, there is a strong possibility it could break through this level in the coming days. Source: Trading View Based on the recent price action, if LINK breaches this level and closes a candle above $29.50, there is a strong possibility it could initially soar by 20% to reach the next resistance level of $35, and later surge by 80% to reach the $52.50 level, which is its all-time high.

""There is massive demand for tokenization, and I am thrilled to join Securitize at such a pivotal moment for the company and the industry,"" Sonnenshein said in a Thursday statement. His appointment started on Dec. 9.  Tokenization is a booming sector at the intersection of digital assets and traditional finance. The process involves representing financial instruments like bonds, credit, commodities and other real-world assets on the blockchain in pursuit of operational efficiency, speedier settlements and cheaper transactions.  Securitize is a key service provider and marketplace in the field, with over $1 billion worth of tokenized instruments on its platform. The company jointly manages asset management behemoth BlackRock's tokenized money market fund BUIDL. BlackRock also invested in Securitize.

During his tenure, the company was one of the firms to have a spot-based bitcoin ETF approved to list in the U.S. in January. Grayscale had taken the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to court over the regulator's repeated refusal to allow it to convert its flagship, closed-end fund Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), then a closed-end fund, into an ETF.

Ranger Finance is an aggregator service that wants to be for perpetual futures what Jupiter is to spot swaps: Solana traders' de-facto homepage for an entire category of on-chain trading.    ""We want the Solana ecosystem to compete with your massive decentralized exchange (DEX) players — Hyperliquid, dYdX, Vertex — and currently the best way to do that is via aggregation,"" said Ranger co-founder Barrett, a DeFi veteran who also runs the biannual mtnDAO hacker house in Salt Lake City.    Perps (futures contracts that don't expire) are key drivers of DeFi activity. Most blockchains have their top venue, and Solana, with Jupiter's perps service, is no exception. But traders seeking to place orders of ""significant size"" may not be able to find their fill on a single service, Barrett said in an interview.    That's where the aggregator comes into play. It scans the market across multiple venues and routes orders accordingly, Barrett said. To start, Ranger will plug into Jupiter and the smaller Flash protocol but it plans to add Drift, Zeta and others.    ""We are a blue ocean, because there's no competition"" on Solana for aggregating perps, Barrett said.    Ranger's eight-person team also includes the pseudonymous FA2, a co-founder of block explorer SolanaFM, and Coby Lim, who leads the OTC spot trading desk for Blockchain.com.    Lim said Ranger is going to build additional tooling and trading capacities that institutional investors expect. For now, it's sticking with the fee-based perps aggregator.    Another plan: Ranger's own crypto. Barrett, an avowedly pro-token founder, said ""there will be a token"" when asked if the protocol has plans for community governance. He didn't elaborate on the token's relation to governance beyond that.    Still, it's unlikely Ranger will treat tokens like votes and their holders as voters, as nearly every other community-governed crypto project does. Instead, the tokens might sooner have a role to play in futarchy, the markets-based governance model that was pioneered at mtnDAO.    Barrett said Ranger will aggressively embrace futarchy when the platform inevitably moves to decentralized governance.    ""Where futarchy really excels is making sure an organization is moving and implementing in the right direction,"" Barrett said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/12/12/ranger-finance-targets-crypto-perps-traders-of-size-on-solana,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/978c998b11f3c4ff096a595b04e6167d51fcaa6d-479x269.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Floki Inu (FLOKI) community will be one of the big recipients of MONKY. The Floki Inu (FLOKI) community will be one of the biggest recipients of Wise Monkey (MONKY), a new high-profile meme launch. The MONKY token will be available through BNB Smart Chain and is now preparing for additional distribution through airdrops. The exposure of MONKY may create additional spoof tokens, so the best approach is to only use the official links for trading or the additional airdrop. MONKY is one of the more inclusive snapshots, with time until December 15. All FLOKI and TokenFi (TOKEN) holders will be eligible, with the actual airdrop expected on December 20. The snapshot will register any FLOKI tokens either on Ethereum or BNB Smart Chain but will issue MONKY only to the BNB Smart Chain addresses. WISE MONKEY ($MONKY) IS NOW LIVE! 🔥 The moment we've all been waiting for – $MONKY is officially live on BNB Chain!

Launch details: – Token name: Wise… https://t.co/NSNZXsrc0O pic.twitter.com/NaGy9aFWvu — FLOKI (@RealFlokiInu) December 12, 2024 The MONKY airdrop already had its snapshot for Apecoin (APE) holders. The current distribution for FLOKI holders will be much smaller. For APE holders, each APE unit held will make holders eligible for 804,828 MONKY. Floki Inu currently holds 35% of the MONKY supply in its special treasury wallet ahead of the actual distribution. The biggest share, 27% of the supply, will go toward direct token holders and stakers of FLOKI. Another 4% will be distributed to TOKEN holders, and the remaining 4% of the supply will go to the users of the Floki Trading Bot. The biggest portion of MONKY tokens will be distributed to wallets and to approved centralized exchanges that also hold FLOKI. For the Floki Bot users, the remaining 4% of the supply will be distributed over a few months, as part of a series of trading competitions. MONKY is the rare meme with a high-profile launch MONKY is a rare new meme token with a high-profile launch. In the past months, new memes would usually originate from the ‘trenches’ of Pump.fun, or have a long-running effort to build a community before the launch. The first trading hours showed a mix of rapid expansion and highly active selling. MONKY started off with five zeroes, later climbing to $0.00003. Soon after peaking, sell pressure set in from early recipients. MONKY locks in $5.8M in liquidity, while activity reached $69.5M in the first 24 hours. MONKY started off strong after its launch on December 12, but started to feel pressure from early sellers. | Source: DexScreener Initially, MONKY started trading as a single pair on PancakeSwap, against USDT. The subsequent listings and added liquidity may change the token’s baseline potential for expansion. On the first day after the launch, Wintermute joined as a market maker, building a portfolio with 0.8% of the token’s supply. Wintermute’s wallets engaged in high-volume transfers with the Gate.IO exchange. More than 53.26% of the MONKY supply is also held in a single wallet, while the community will receive a total of 45% of all tokens. The project has a roadmap with expectations of future price expansion, awaiting a price of $0.03 to $0.05 soon after the airdrops are finished. The token is raising some eyebrows with its immediate success. Soon after publishing the asset’s official smart contract , MONKY had already reached 164,692 wallets on the BNB Smart Chain. The new token surpasses even far older trending assets. The wide distribution is partially explained by the airdrop to the community of APE holders. The allocation to APE holders is for 10% of the total supply. What is even more surprising, MONKY started trading immediately after its token generation event. The exchange gained a prominent KuCoin listing, in addition to spreading to other markets like CoinEx, Bitrue, and BitMart. For the airdrop, MONKY will be supported by Binance, OKX, KuCoin, Gate.IO, Uphold, MEXC, and Bithumb. The airdrop support will not automatically translate to a listing. Who is behind MONKY? A meme launch like MONKY can only come from an influential community. The new meme token is backed by Ape Accelerator and Forj, an Animoca Brands subsidiary. The backing explains the industry connections and immediate listings and partnerships. While MONKY is legitimate and will probably keep up a high profile on social media, the asset is also relatively risky and volatile. In its early trading, MONKY has been pressured by selling, as recipients tried to cash out on the early hype. The MONKY social media team is also riling up the owners of Bored Ape NFT to support the new token.

Right now, three cryptos still worth pennies are looking strong and have set their eyes firmly on $1 as they take big steps towards it. With a rally coming soon, they could quickly breach the $1 psychological level. Rexas Finance (RXS) Rexas Finance has gained traction with its presale, which started in September. The presale has sold out eight stages quickly and is now in stage nine, with the price increasing from $0.03 to $0.125. This price increase reflects over 300% gains for early investors, and by the time RXS finally launches at $0.20, it will deliver a massive 566% return. However, that's just the starting point for RXS. According to market experts, the token is poised for a rally to $1 and beyond. Its strategic positioning in the market is fueling Rexas Finance's bullish narrative. Leveraging the finance space, Rexas Finance intends to redefine real-world asset tokenization. Real-world assets like gold, commodities, and artworks are well known to be expensive and illiquid. The cost has blocked out small investors from the market, while the lack of liquidity has limited accessibility. However, Rexas Finance kills two birds and more with asset tokenization. Turning these assets into digital tokens can now be globally accessible and can be traded in smaller fractions at a lower cost. Experts have praised this exceptional approach as a game-changer for investors. Retail and institutional investors have also become interested in the project and are trooping to its presale. Additionally, Rexas Finance offers high-value tools that reshape asset management and investment. These include the Rexas Token Builder, which makes tokenization simple even for those with zero technical knowledge. The Rexas GenAI automatically generates high-quality digital artworks for NFTs, and Rexas DeFi serves as the project's DeFi platform. Other tools include the Rexas QuickMint Bot, Rexas AI Shield, Rexas Estate, etc. Rexas Finance recently did a Certik Audit, assuring investors of its security and potential for long-term success. The initiative has likewise been included in CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko to provide tracking. RXS, its native token, will launch on several exchanges, including three major ones. Experts have asserted that Rexas Finance has built momentum with the token launch as the breaking point. Its surge, backed by strong fundamentals and investors' confidence, will lead the token to new highs. RXS could rally past one in the first hours of its launch and reach $12 before 2025 ends. Stellar (XLM) Stellar (XLM) is currently trading at $0.48 after rallying almost 400% in the past month. Despite such an incredible increase so far, it's yet to show exhaustion, as a bullish pennant pattern has formed on the chart. This pennant often precedes further price increases, showing that XLM can continue its upward trend. XLM had previously crossed the $0.50 mark but saw a pullback. It's about to retest $0.50, and should it stay above it, it will head toward $0.80, which is its all-time high. This could eventually bring it to $1. However, Stellar's performance is tightly correlated with Ripple (XRP) because of their shared origin and focus on payment. Thus, Ripple's ongoing rally and achievements could positively influence XLM's price. Similarly, a possible spot XLM ETF approval in 2025 could drive institutional interest in the token. Therefore, Ripple's momentum, broader market sentiment, and Stellar's trajectory will be crucial in determining whether Stellar achieves the $1 target. However, the market looked bullish and primed for a huge rally to $1. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin has seen eleven exceptional years. However, 2025 will be a bigger year for DOGE as analysts predict it will reach $1. Elon Musk's post has also sparked a price increase of more than 5% today. Musk shared a post on X with images of his son. Musk called himself ""Doge Father"" in the post while he called his son ""Doge Son."" DOGE's price movement also looks promising. It has broken past the key resistance level at $0.44. If it sustains above it, it could trigger a higher rally to $0.63, possibly pushing the price closer to the $1 psychological mark. DOGE's performance has also been buoyed by broader market sentiment, especially Bitcoin's rise above $100,000. As altcoins often mirror Bitcoin's momentum, Dogecoin could benefit significantly from this trend. However, caution remains as DOGE faces resistance at higher levels. The coming weeks will be critical for Dogecoin. If bullish momentum continues, the $1 target may not be far from reach, making it a coin to watch closely. Conclusion Rexas Finance (RXS), Stellar (XLM), and Dogecoin (DOGE) have the $1 mark in sight as they are poised to rally soon. While XLM and DOGE target $1, RXS is set to surge higher. Before the end of 2025, experts believe it could even reach $1 if it sustains its momentum.

CryptoQuant analysts argued that the ETH price could rise above $5,000 with increasing on-chain activity and institutional demand. CryptoQuant analysts have claimed that Ethereum’s price could surpass $5,000 if current supply-demand dynamics continue, supported by strong on-chain metrics and investor interest. Analysts stated that spot Ethereum ETFs, daily transactions, total supply and high network activity will be effective in the rise in ETH. Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a 13-day streak of inflows on Wednesday, reaching nearly $2 billion in cumulative net inflows. In addition, the total number of daily transactions has been hovering between 6.5 million and 7.5 million over the past few months. The total supply of ETH also reached its highest level since April 2023. “If current demand and supply dynamics continue, ETH could rise above $5,000. Based on the realized price of ETH, the current upper limit for the price of ETH is around $5,200. “This upper bound marked the peak for ETH in the 2021 bull run.

Ethereum stands a very good chance of surpassing its old records and touching $ 10,000 as soon as in the near term. Currently trading around $3887.61, this would translate into a fantastic upside. However, while it is worth pointing out that Ethereum makes for a good investment in the long term, there is one up-and-coming token in the world of cryptocurrencies that has even higher potential returns: Rexas Finance (RXS). Ethereum’s Path to $10,000 Ethereum's bull run has been nothing but splendid for its investors, and if it witnesses another repetition like it did in 2021, the $10,000 mark does not feel like a distant target anymore. Seeing how ETH network, which functions on smart contracts, has gathered a lot of attention with decentralized finances and NFTs growing, there is no doubting this movement's speed. Ethereum 2.0 was expected to considerably help the scalability of the network and reduce the cost of transacting, which will definitely aid in its overall expansion. However, as Ethereum grows older and more mature, its ROI would not be in the same range as that of up-and-coming competitors such as Rexas Finance (RXS), which may offer greater rewards to investors that come in earlier. Why Rexas Finance (RXS) Offers a Better ROI Given the way Ethereum’s price is rising, one can say that there are chances that Rexas Finance might attract a lot more investors because they have rounds for several investments at a significantly higher rate than RXS. RXS deals in the emerging space of real-world asset tokenization, which is expanding rapidly. Functional real estate investing is one of the assets offered, along with art and even commodities. Rexas Finance is creating a market space worth trillions in dollars by making it easier for the public to invest in these tough to invest in high valued items. The ongoing RXS presale is at Stage 9 and has already raised over $24.7 million. RXS has currently sold 321 million tokens, and the token is currently on sale for 0.125. Such an increase would be a whopping 300% from its original value of $0.03, offered during the early presale phases. With its token launch soon, it is expected that the only way to go is up; in other words, the token price will surely rise, and any early investors will be guaranteed a significant increase. Profits. Tokenomics: A Strategy for Sustainability and Value Restoration Rexas Finance`s tokenomics is built with the vision of supporting the development of the ecosystem in the long run and creating a robust community. From 1 billion tokens, 42.5% is earmarked for the presale stages, creating ample opportunities to invest. 22.5 % is also set aside for staking pools where users can lock tokens in and earn rewards. Other allocations are liquidity 15%, treasury 10%, marketing 3%, team 3%, charity 2% and collaborations 2%. This strategic allocation protects RXS from collapse and enhances its competitiveness for further growth. Comparing Market Opportunities Ethereum has established itself as the most valuable blockchain network. Investment in Decentralized Finance and other Web 3 sectors has surpassed 1 Trillion Dollars, but Ethereum's impressive ecosystem hasn’t managed to create significant price growth. On the contrary, Rexas Finance is entering the $379 trillion global real estate market, a segment almost untouched by blockchain until now. The Rexas Token Builder and QuickMint Bot, which facilitate the creation and circulation of tokenized assets, grant RXS a massive advantage in this domain. In addition, Rexas Finance's Certik-audited platform is well-secured for institutional and retail investors. In this respect, RXS emerges as the leader in ROI, bringing profits even more than Ethereum. Community and Incentives Drive Rexas Finance Forward Rexas Finance has established a distinct identity due to its active community engagement and out-of-the-box marketing techniques. One such promotional strategy that has received great attention and strengthened the potential of attracting new investors is the giveaway offer, where the project is giving away $1 million, with 20 of its participants taking home $50,000 each in RXS tokens. All these and the community perspective underlining the project ensure that Rexas Finance has a dedicated and ever-growing client base. Conclusion: Rexas Finance Outshines Ethereum Should Ethereum replicate the bullish run it experienced last year and achieve a price level of $1500, this would be a big plus in its record. However, Rexas Finance (RXS) is poised for even greater returns. With its promising presale performance and strategic growth, RXS stands as a top contender, potentially outperforming Ethereum in ROI for early investors.

Data from on-chain and financial metrics provider Glassnode revealed that Chainlink ( LINK ) futures open interest reached $770.27 million as LINK hit its highest levels in almost two years. OI, a measure of market activity, provides insights into investor sentiment, which appears bullish in this case. Glassnode’s data from December 11 highlighted that Chainlink’s OI was nearly three times that of Toncoin ( TON ) and twice that of TRON ( TRX ). Specifically, TON and TRX futures open interest stood at $259 million and $356 million, respectively. On Dec. 12, LINK’s price soared to $29.45, continuing its upward momentum after reaching levels last seen in January 2022. Read more: Chainlink price reaches highest level in years as whale moves $9.6m worth to Aave Glassnode suggests bulls retain the upper hand due to improving fundamentals. This is despite the latest profit taking in the spot market. Analysts say the selling largely came from speculative traders. As speculators pushed profit taking to its highest level since February, “long-term holders stayed mostly quiet.” “While LINK’s price surge was clearly driven by speculative and short-term market activity, its fundamentals are improving too. Active addresses momentum is trending higher, with the short-term SMA of 6,682 still above the long-term SMA of 5,878. That said, active addresses remain far below their 2021 peak of 23,416,” Glassnode posted on X. As of the time of writing, Chainlink had gained 13% on the day and was up 97% over the past week and 30 days, respectively. The upside has come amid key ecosystem partnerships for the oracle network, including with World Liberty Financial. The Trump-inspired crypto project announced in November that it was adopting Chainlink’s technology to bring decentralized finance to mass adoption. Additionally, Chainlink Labs has partnered with Emirates NBD Digital Asset Lab to facilitate asset tokenization and digital asset management. Other significant integrations and collaborations involve leading institutions such as Swift, SBI, and UBS, among others.

37550200,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=104961,1734017684,Argentina’s President Milei Embraces Crypto-Friendly Policies in Year Two of Presidency,"Argentina's President Javier Milei is doubling down on crypto adoption as part of his broader economic reform agenda. Known for his libertarian ideals and criticism of central banks, Milei's policies indicate a bold shift toward embracing digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, alongside traditional currencies. Interestingly, a recent disclosure confirms that his second year in office could introduce massive changes, particularly around monetary policy and free currency competition.The Push for Currency FreedomIn his speech , President Javier Milei discussed plans for his second year in office, focusing on economic reform, reducing government size, and expanding freedoms. He emphasized fostering foreign investment and cutting public spending.Milei announced plans to abolish the long-standing currency exchange restrictions, a move expected to end reliance on the Central Bank of Argentina. This means that citizens will have the freedom to transact in any currency of their choice, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This policy excludes tax payments, which will still require Argentine pesos for now. The change seeks to stabilize the economy, reduce inflation, and create a sustainable growth path by aligning with global financial standards.Notably, the policy emphasizes on free competition, allowing individuals to choose currencies that best suit their needs. This aligns with Milei's vision of closing the Central Bank entirely, which he believes will eradicate inflation.This strategy could benefit Bitcoin and crypto adoption in the country, which has already seen a sharp increase in recent times. The Argentine President has already confirmed his positive endorsement for Bitcoin, a move that has bolstered confidence in the asset among Argentinians. Milei's Pro-Bitcoin StanceMilei's pro-Bitcoin stance predates his presidency. As a vocal advocate, he has praised Bitcoin's decentralized nature and its ability to counteract inflation. His economic vision closely mirrors the policies of El Salvador , where Bitcoin has become legal tender. However, Milei's approach presents citizens with a choice rather than mandating cryptocurrency use. He has actively supported the idea of contracts denominated in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, a policy already gaining traction in Argentina. Argentina's economy has long been plagued by hyperinflation, making the peso an unreliable store of value. As a result, cryptocurrencies and stablecoins have seen high adoption rates in the country. Argentina ranks among the top nations globally for crypto use, with its low energy costs supporting a thriving Bitcoin mining industry. For 2024, the country sits 15th on the Chainalysis Crypto Adoption Index globally and fourth in Latin America .Despite advancements, Milei's administration faces criticism over regulatory hurdles that could hinder adoption. For instance, recent laws tightening oversight of virtual asset service providers triggered backlash from crypto advocates. Nonetheless, the president remains committed to fostering a Bitcoin-friendly environment.Milei's policies are also expected to attract international investment. His administration has held discussions with private investors and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a necessary step toward broader financial reform.Interestingly, the United States could witness a similar pro-crypto stance within its government, as the forthcoming Donald Trump administration promises to foster the industry's growth.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/12/argentinas-president-milei-embraces-crypto-friendly-policies-in-year-two-of-presidency/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=argentinas-president-milei-embraces-crypto-friendly-policies-in-year-two-of-presidency,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

With its cutting-edge technology and strategic vision, $LCAI is already turning heads—and its Lightchain AI Presale is the perfect opportunity to get involved early. Explore the Presale here . As the world of altcoins continues to evolve, factors like innovation, utility, and market confidence will define which projects achieve long-term success. Heading into 2025, Lightchain AI stands out as a strong contender for altcoin dominance. Could $LCAI prove to be the best altcoin of the year? Let’s explore the predictions and key elements driving its potential rise to the top. Lightchain AI ($LCAI): A Revolutionary Altcoin What Sets Lightchain AI Apart? At its core, Lightchain AI integrates artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology, solving critical challenges in scalability, governance, and privacy. Its groundbreaking features—Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM)—are redefining the altcoin landscape.

Challenges and How $LCAI Overcomes Them Market Trust As a new entrant, building market trust is critical for $LCAI. Transparent communication, consistent technological advancements, and strategic partnerships will be key. Adoption Hurdles While the technology is robust, encouraging widespread adoption will require effective outreach. $LCAI’s roadmap addresses this with initiatives like developer grants and cross-industry collaborations. Competition The altcoin market is fiercely competitive. By focusing on unique value propositions and real-world utility, $LCAI can stand out from the crowd. Predictions for 2025: Why $LCAI Could Lead the Altcoin Pack Technological Leadership With its innovative use of AI, $LCAI is set to dominate industries seeking scalable, privacy-preserving solutions. Its PoI and AIVM technologies position it as a leader in decentralized intelligence. Market Confidence The strong presale performance and clear roadmap inspire confidence among investors and developers alike, setting the stage for significant adoption in 2025. Community and Ecosystem Growth By fostering a robust developer ecosystem and engaging with enterprises, $LCAI ensures that its platform remains relevant and scalable. Does Lightchain AI 1000x In 2025 There are no guarantees in the volatile world of cryptocurrency, and predicting a 1000x increase in value for $LCAI by 2025 is nothing because of this innovative altcoin. However, with its unique use of AI and potential for real-world adoption, $LCAI has the ingredients for significant growth in the coming years. It's definitely one to watch. Plus, with its deflationary mechanism and utility integration, $LCAI's tokenomics support long-term sustainability, making it a promising investment for those looking to diversify their crypto portfolio. Ultimately, only time will tell if $LCAI can achieve 1000x growth, but all signs point to a bright future for this ambitious altcoin.

In a new report , Bitwise says it envisions Coinbase’s stock (COIN) reaching a price tag of $700 in 2025 – more than double its current price – making it surpass financial services titan Charles Schwab in terms of market cap. “Heading into 2023, investors could pick up Coinbase stock for $35. Today, it’s trading at $344, up nearly 10x. We think it could go higher. Way higher. Our prediction: Coinbase stock will trade above $700 per share in 2025 (more than doubling today’s price). That would make Coinbase the most valuable brokerage in the world, surpassing Charles Schwab. The reason? Coinbase is more than just a brokerage. There are three major catalysts that will help it get there.” According to Bitwise, the three main reasons Coinbase’s stock will skyrocket next year are its booming stablecoin business rooted in the dollar-pegged crypto asset USDC , its Ethereum ( ETH ) layer-2 scaling solution Base, and the staking and custody services it provides. Bitwise’s data reveals that Coinbase’s stablecoin business has jumped by $162 million (+31%) year to date while its blockchain brings in “tens of millions” of dollars worth of revenue every quarter. Furthermore, Coinbase’s staking and custody services have generated $589 million worth of revenue, up a staggering 106% from the same time period last year. Bitwise also makes predictions for the top two crypto assets by market cap, noting that Bitcoin ( BTC ) could reach $200,000 by next year while ETH could hit $7,000. COIN is trading for $317 at time of writing, a 4.8% gain during the last 24 hours.

This newfound interest isn’t random; it’s a sign of larger blockchain disruptions on the horizon. Among the many platforms ready to harness this momentum is Lightchain Protocol AI , a next-gen blockchain innovator that seamlessly blends artificial intelligence with decentralized technology. Could December be the month where this convergence sparks a seismic shift? Let’s explore the intricacies of this paradigm and whether this blockchain could be poised for exponential growth. 🌟🚀 What Are Bitcoin Whales Doing in DeFi? Bitcoin whales—investors holding massive quantities of BTC—are making waves by injecting liquidity into decentralized finance. Why? The answer lies in DeFi’s ability to unlock unprecedented earning potential through staking, yield farming, and liquidity mining. The returns in this niche often dwarf traditional Bitcoin holding strategies, providing a lucrative playground for high-value investors. Data shows that DeFi protocols managed over $40 billion in total locked value (TVL) for much of 2023, signaling institutional-level interest. But unlike earlier waves, today’s movement is smarter, data-driven, and laser-focused on ecosystems that amplify utility and scalability. That’s where blockchain protocols like Lightchain AI come into play. With features like their Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) , blockchain technology is no longer merely about transactions—it’s about transforming decentralized computational power into real-world AI solutions. Enter the Lightchain Era 🌐 Lightchain Protocol AI is no ordinary addition to the blockchain landscape. Through PoI, it redefines consensus mechanisms by rewarding participants for valuable AI tasks such as model training and optimization. Meanwhile, the AIVM ensures that complex AI processes occur efficiently, securely, and on-chain. Why Does This Matter for DeFi? The DeFi whales are tapping into a broader realization—investing in blockchains that prioritize scalability, innovation, and performance leads to more sustainable returns. The Lightchain Protocol offers: Efficient Resource Utilization Bitcoin struggles with PoW energy inefficiency, but Lightchain’s PoI ensures minimal energy consumption while enabling advanced AI tasks. Enhanced Decentralization A community-driven governance structure ensures equitable participation and evolution. Scalability Meets AI Strength With the AIVM integrated, Lightchain powers next-gen DeFi dApps that seamlessly harness AI-driven operational logic. These innovations position Lightchain as a magnet for Bitcoin whales seeking to diversify their impact while maximizing profitability.

Danylo Hetmantsev, head of the Ukrainian Parliament’s Committee on Finance, Tax, and Customs Policy, confirmed that the draft law is nearly ready for its first reading, according to Pravda. Hetmantsev stated that the law is being developed in collaboration with the National Bank of Ukraine and the International Monetary Fund The proposed law will regulate cryptocurrency transactions and implement a taxation model similar to that of securities. Profits from crypto assets will be taxed when they are converted into traditional currency. Hetmantsev emphasized that Ukraine is adopting a cautious approach regarding tax exemptions for cryptocurrencies, citing concerns over potential tax evasion in traditional markets. The government has avoided including tax exemptions in the draft to prevent misuse, with consultations involving European experts and the IMF helping shape the cautious stance. Taxation on crypto transactions will mirror the tax treatment of securities, ensuring that profits are taxed only when assets are converted into fiat currencies.

Nvidia has been developing AI software and driving automation for more than a decade; however, its endeavors have not yet yielded results. The company’s researchers in China would be well-positioned to collaborate with local manufacturers who are seeking to improve their offerings by incorporating these technologies. Nvidia moves some operations to China The company is reportedly alleged to have opened a new office in the Zhongguancun tech, an innovation center in Beijing that is the focal point of China’s aspiration to become a technological powerhouse. It is home to nearly 9,000 high-tech companies. As part of expanding the company, Nvidia increased the size of its team of researchers in Beijing by approximately 200 people, particularly those who specialize in self-driving technology. The decision was made in response to China’s growing interest in autonomous driving. Baidu Inc. and other established firms have already begun providing robotaxi services in specific cities through their Apollo Go venture. Nvidia, currently based in Santa Clara, California, will increase its workforce from approximately 3,000 at the beginning of 2024 to about 4,000 by the end of the year. The AI chips leader also expanded its after-sales service and networking software development teams The US collaboration with China’s workforce Beijing has achieved a dominant position in the development of EV technologies and, through its support for domestic electric vehicle manufacturers, has contributed to the reduction of prices for a new generation of connected cars. Nvidia has endeavored to preserve positive relationships with Beijing. Still, this week, the local antitrust regulator announced an investigation into Nvidia’s 2020 acquisition of Mellanox, which the authorities had previously conditionally approved. The investigation commenced only weeks after Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang emphasized China’s technological contributions during a visit to Hong Kong. It is believed to be an element of the expanding US-China trade dispute and may result in a fine or requests for remedial measures. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose additional tariffs on Chinese commodities, while Beijing has implemented an export ban on critical materials. Even though China is subject to US trade restrictions that prevent Nvidia from selling its most advanced semiconductors there, the company generated $5.4 billion in sales during the September quarter. The US chip designer continues to consider the country a significant market and research center.

CYBRO to List Ahead of Schedule Following 450% Surge and $7 Million Presale CYBRO, the AI-driven multichain platform, is accelerating its timeline for listing on major exchanges after a standout presale performance. The platform raised $7 million and drew nearly 20,000 investors, positioning itself as a frontrunner in decentralized finance innovation. During its presale, CYBRO’s token price surged 450%, climbing from $0.01 to $0.055. The token is set to debut at $0.06 on major crypto exchanges including Gate.io, and the listing is planned on December 14th. Be part of CYBRO’s listing momentum before it unlocks the full potential CYBRO aims to democratize access to decentralized finance with tools such as staking, farming, and lending. Its presale marked key milestones, including: CYBRO App Launch: Over 30 vaults offering competitive APYs, tailored to diverse investor strategies Blast Index Debut: A one-click investment feature that simplifies DeFi participation by integrating with lending protocols Platform Growth: Laying the groundwork for a streamlined, user-centric DeFi ecosystem. The platform’s roadmap through 2025 promises to build on its foundation with advanced features such as leverage farming, lending aggregators, and enhanced AI-powered tools. CYBRO’s listing comes amid growing interest in AI-driven financial platforms. With the momentum from its presale and a planned listing price of $0.06, the project is set to draw increased attention from both retail and institutional investors. As CYBRO prepares for its market debut, its combination of strong fundamentals and rapid growth positions it as one to watch in the evolving DeFi landscape. Prepare for Lift-Off: CYBRO’s presale success is just the beginning Bitcoin: Revolutionizing Peer-to-Peer Digital Transactions Bitcoin (BTC) is the first cryptocurrency, enabling direct transactions between individuals without the need for banks or central authorities. Created by Satoshi Nakamoto, it uses blockchain technology to operate a distributed ledger across many network nodes. This system ensures transparency and security by removing intermediaries. Transactions are validated through mining, where participants solve complex puzzles and earn bitcoins as rewards. The network is designed to resist fraud and manipulation. Every four years, a process called ""halving"" reduces the mining rewards by half, contributing to the scarcity of bitcoins with a capped supply of 21 million coins. Bitcoin's technology offers a new approach to digital transactions, paving the way for decentralized finance. NEAR Protocol: Scalable Decentralized Platform Empowering dApp Development NEAR Protocol is a platform that helps developers create decentralized applications. It uses sharding to make the network more efficient and scalable. This means it can handle more transactions at once. NEAR operates on a distributed network, like centralized data storage systems, but it's decentralized. It was founded by Alex Skidanov and Illia Polosukhin and raised over $20 million from major venture firms. NEAR features the Nightshade sharding solution for scalability. It has the Rainbow Bridge, which allows Ethereum token transfers. It also has Aurora, a Layer 2 solution that uses Ethereum's technologies for better performance and lower fees. NEAR aims to make blockchain technology more accessible and efficient for developers. VeChain (VET): Enhancing Supply Chain Transparency with Blockchain VeChain is a blockchain platform that improves supply chain management by assigning unique IDs and sensors to physical products. This allows detailed tracking through the supply chain, helping verify authenticity and manage recalls in industries like fashion, food, and automotive. Founded by Sunny Lu, former CIO at Louis Vuitton China, VeChain transitioned from Ethereum to its own blockchain, VeChainThor, introducing a dual-token system with VET for value transfer and VTHO for transaction fees. Its partnerships with companies like PricewaterhouseCoopers, Walmart China, and BMW demonstrate its practical applications. VeChain's technology enhances transparency and efficiency, showing significant adoption and utility in real-world scenarios. Kaspa: A Proof-of-Work Cryptocurrency with High Block Rates Kaspa is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that uses the GHOSTDAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchains, GHOSTDAG allows blocks created in parallel to coexist and orders them in consensus. This creates a blockDAG, a generalization of Nakamoto consensus. Kaspa maintains secure operation with high block rates, currently one block per second and aiming for even higher rates. Confirmation times are very short, limited mainly by internet latency. Kaspa includes features like Reachability for querying the DAG's topology, block data pruning, SPV proofs, and plans for subnetwork support. These features can make future implementation of layer 2 solutions easier. Conclusion In summary, while established cryptocurrencies like BTC, NEAR, VET, and KAS may present steady growth, their short-term potential appears limited. On the other hand, CYBRO is emerging as a standout in the DeFi sector. With its advanced technology, it offers investors unique opportunities to enhance their earnings through AI-driven yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain. Features such as attractive staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases contribute to a superior user experience, complemented by smooth deposit and withdrawal processes. By prioritizing transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO distinguishes itself as a promising project attracting significant interest from prominent investors and influencers.

BlackRock’s ETF accounts for roughly half of this investor stockpile, with approximately 529,000 tokens held under Coinbase Custody. Crypto sentiment posited that Bitcoin and spot BTC ETF demand would skyrocket under the incoming pro-crypto Donald Trump administration. Banks like Goldman Sachs, which already own nearly $1 billion in BTC ETF shares, signalled willingness to increase participation based on regulatory changes. States such as Alabama and Pennsylvania considered passing laws to set up strategic BTC reserves, while governments in the U.S., Brazil, and Canada mulled the same legislation.

Dogecoin: The Plentiful Meme Coin Turned Top Cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) was launched in 2013 as a fun alternative to other cryptocurrencies, featuring a Shiba Inu dog logo. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has no maximum supply, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Initially seen as a ""memecoin,"" its value surged in 2021, reaching the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap. This rise was driven by social media buzz and support from figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin showcases the power of community and social media in financial markets. Its potential lies in its widespread recognition and active community. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin remains a notable player due to its popularity and continued interest from investors. PEPE: A Deflationary Memecoin Capturing the Spirit of Pepe the Frog PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on the Ethereum network, inspired by the Pepe the Frog meme. It aims to follow the success of memecoins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. PEPE has no transaction tax and prides itself on being a pure memecoin without utility. It reached a peak market cap of $1.6 billion in mid-2023. The coin's roadmap includes phases to increase visibility through social media trends and exchange listings. A burning mechanism enhances scarcity, and a redistribution system rewards long-term holders. As an ERC-20 token, PEPE benefits from Ethereum's security. It is available on platforms like Uniswap, Binance, and KuCoin. In the current market cycle, PEPE's simplicity and community support may attract investors. BONK: A Rising Solana-Based Memecoin with Community Focus BONK is a Solana-based memecoin featuring a Shiba Inu mascot. It aims to empower the Solana community by redistributing power from venture capital tokens. After a Coinbase listing, BONK surged over 100%. As a ""community coin,"" it airdropped 50% of its supply to participants in Solana's NFT and DeFi ecosystems. By mid-December 2023, BONK became the third-largest memecoin by market cap and gained over 10,000% year-to-date. Its integration into Solana's ecosystem, including the launch of BonkSwap, a decentralized exchange, shows its potential. Despite challenges like a high total supply and volatility, BONK's growth and involvement in a growing ecosystem make it an attractive option in the current market cycle. WIF: Dogwifhat Meme Coin on Solana Blockchain Gains Momentum Dogwifhat (WIF) is a new meme coin on the Solana blockchain, inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme. Meme coins are cryptocurrencies that come from internet memes or pop culture, focusing on community and fun. Dog-themed tokens are popular in the crypto space. WIF aims to gain popularity through its viral meme and community engagement. The Solana blockchain offers fast and low-cost transactions, which benefits WIF. In the current market cycle, WIF's attractiveness depends on its ability to build a strong community and gain viral status. Its potential lies in combining a popular meme with advanced blockchain technology. Conclusion While coins like DOGE, PEPE, BONK, and WIF have shown promise, their short-term potential may be limited. DOGEN emerges as a token designed for those seeking luxury and success. With significant growth potential and real benefits for early adopters, DOGEN is building a community of leaders aiming to dominate the market and achieve exceptional results.

37547957,https://finbold.com/?p=219037,1734016613,Crypto expert says this pattern could send ‘XRP to $4’,"After a prolonged period of flat price action that spanned the first three quarters of the year, XRP seems poised to finish the year off strongly. In tandem with the wider cryptocurrency market bull run that started in November following the U.S. presidential elections, the digital asset saw a significant price surge. Before the uptrend started, XRP was trading at roughly $0.50 — at press time, prices have increased to $2.41, receding from a prior high of $2.71 on December 2. With this latest move, XRP’s year-to-date (YTD) gains stand at an impressive 292.55% — on a monthly basis, the cryptocurrency has seen prices increase by 261.95%. These returns put the token in the upper echelon — particularly once we factor in that it provides actual utility, unlike many of the digital assets that have seen similar price increases in recent times. XRP price YTD chart. Source: Finbold At present, it would seem like most crypto analysts are quite bullish on XRP and the wider Ripple Labs ecosystem, particularly as its stablecoin, RLUSD, has recently received final approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Most of the analysis being done has extremely long timeframes in mind (at least by the crypto market’s standards) — which see XRP outperforming the wider market and reaching prices as high as $48 . However, a recently spotted chart pattern suggests that the token could reach a price of $4 in short order, after a temporary setback — as detailed by renowned cryptocurrency technical analyst Ali Martinez in a December 12 X post. Bull flag suggests XRP will see a sharp move to the upside The chart shared by Martinez depicts a bull flag chart pattern that began forming on December 3. This pattern is characterized by two segments — a ‘flagpole’ representing an initial increase in price, followed by a ‘flag’ in which price action is choppy, with small moves to the downside. A formation of this type is a bullish continuation pattern — signaling that the thus-prevailing uptrend will continue after the short period of consolidation. XRP bullish flag chart pattern. Source: Ali Martinez on X In the case of a bull flag, the rule of thumb is as follows — a price target is set that is equal to the height of the initial upward price movement. Readers should note that the single green candle seen in the chart above, corresponding to December 3, is not the entirety of the flagpole — rather, the flagpole starts at the beginning of the chart, around November 29. With that in mind, Martinez set a price target slightly above $4 — although the expert did caution that the TD Sequential recently flashed a sell signal on XRP’s 4-hour chart. This could lead to a brief correction — but if the analysis holds water, this could be a positive on the whole — representing a more attractive entry point for a long position. Martinez also noted that traders should keep an eye out for price action near the $2.46 mark — a breakout above those levels would serve as confirmation of the pattern, and would mark the beginning of another upswing.

The legislation, developed in collaboration with the National Bank of Ukraine and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), is expected to be ready for its first reading after the New Year. ""Our goal is to pass this law and ensure cryptocurrency is legalized in Ukraine during the first quarter of 2025,"" Hetmantsev stated.No Tax Breaks on Crypto AssetsHowever, the anticipated legalization will not include tax exemptions for cryptocurrency transactions. The proposed tax framework will follow a model similar to the one used for securities, where profits are taxed when virtual assets are converted into fiat currency. Hetmantsev explained that, after consulting with European experts and the IMF, a cautious approach had been adopted regarding tax exemptions. ""Allowing exemptions could potentially lead to tax evasion in traditional markets,"" he added.The legislation on cryptocurrency taxation has already taken a significant step forward. In November 2023, a draft law on taxing virtual asset transactions was registered in the Ukrainian parliament. The adoption of this law is expected to be the final step toward fully legalizing cryptocurrencies in the country.Meanwhile, other countries like Russia and South Korea are taking different approaches to crypto taxation. South Korea recently announced differing taxation on crypto assets for another two years, citing the need to refine the legislation further.Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin approved a law that treats crypto assets as property. The new law also exempts the mining and sale of crypto from VAT.Income from mining will be taxed as in-kind income.

The RSI is near neutral, suggesting room for upward movement. If Bitcoin breaks past the nearest resistance at $110,332, it could aim for the next target at $121,680, which is about 15% higher than current levels. The strong six-month gain of 42.74% indicates solid momentum. Although the MACD is slightly negative, the overall trend points upwards. With the upcoming altcoin season and bullish market sentiment, Bitcoin may continue its ascent, paving the way for new highs. Ethereum Eyes Breakout as Altcoin Season and Bull Run Near Ethereum's price is gaining momentum within the $3600 to $4200 range. It's approaching the 10-day simple moving average, indicating potential upward movement. The nearest resistance is around $4400; breaking this could push the price toward the next target above $5000. The RSI below 40 suggests room for growth before hitting overbought levels. A strong 1-month price increase of over 18% shows upward momentum. With the anticipated altcoin season and a global crypto bull run on the horizon, Ethereum could see significant gains. Investors might expect substantial percentage increases as market sentiment turns bullish. BNB Poised for Breakout: Potential Surge Amid Bullish Altcoin Season BNB has been trading between $646.43 and $816.53, showing steady growth over the past six months with a 10.73% increase. The recent uptick of 9.76% this month suggests building momentum. With the nearest resistance at $890, a break above this level could see BNB targeting the next resistance at $1060, offering significant upside. The Relative Strength Index at 40.40 indicates room for upward movement before hitting overbought territory. As the altcoin season approaches and the global crypto market turns bullish, BNB may be poised for a breakout, potentially rising by over 20% if it surpasses current resistance levels. TRON Jumps 20% in a Week, Targets $0.57 Resistance Level TRON (TRX) has seen impressive gains, rising over 20% in the past week and more than 65% in the last month. Trading between $0.20 and $0.45, it's approaching the 10-day simple moving average of $0.27 and nearing the 100-day average of $0.31. The Relative Strength Index is at 41.88, suggesting there's still room for growth before hitting overbought conditions. With the nearest resistance level at $0.57, breaking through could open the path to the next resistance at $0.82. This climb could mean significant percentage gains from current prices. As altcoin season approaches, TRON may continue its upward momentum. Conclusion Established coins like BTC, ETH, BNB, and TRX may have less short-term potential. DOGEN, however, is designed for those seeking luxury and success, with an expected 700% growth by presale's end and potential for massive returns this altcoin season. It follows successful tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

Projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu laid the foundation for what’s now a thriving niche, proving that fun and community-driven tokens could pack serious financial punch. But let’s be real: the meme coin landscape is more competitive than ever. That’s where BTFD Coin enters the picture, flipping the script with a killer mix of P2E gaming, staking rewards, and a vibrant community pushing its momentum through the roof. Here’s the juicy part: BTFD Coin (BTFD) isn’t just making noise; it’s making waves. The much-hyped meme coin presale launched on Tuesday, November 26, 2024, and the numbers? Insane. With over $3.4 million raised so far, it’s proving to be one of the hottest presales in recent memory. Crypto analysts are already buzzing with bullish predictions about the coin’s trajectory, suggesting a potential listing price of $0.0006—a significant leap from its presale starting price of $0.000004. Now, if that doesn’t scream “opportunity,” what does? But BTFD isn’t just the star of the show. Meme coin veterans like Dogwifhat and Floki Inu are still in the game, turning heads with their unique offerings and strategies. Whether you’re a seasoned crypto investor or just diving into the wild world of meme coins, this weekend is shaping up to be prime time for getting in on the action. BTFD Coin: The New Meme King in the Making If there’s one project redefining what it means to be a meme coin, it’s BTFD Coin . From its explosive presale performance to its groundbreaking features, BTFD has all the makings of a major player. Let’s break it down. BTFD Coin launched its presale with a starting price of just $0.000004, and it’s already climbed to $0.00012 by Stage 11. That’s a 300% increase for early investors. The presale has raised over $3.4 million in record time, with more than 50 billion coins sold and over 4,400 holders jumping on the bull bandwagon. To put that in perspective, BTFD hit the $1 million mark in under 10 days and surged past $2.5 million in just 14 days. It’s a performance that’s turning heads across the crypto world. What makes BTFD stand out? For starters, it’s more than just a meme coin—it’s a utility-packed project. Its play-to-earn (P2E) game offers gamers a chance to earn while having fun, and the staking rewards provide passive income opportunities for long-term holders. Plus, the community behind BTFD is fierce, with a meme-driven culture that’s as hilarious as it is passionate. Here’s a little investment math for you: Let’s say you dropped $25,000 into BTFD during Stage 5, where the price was $0.00005. That investment would’ve snagged you a cool 500 million BTFD coins. Fast forward to the end of the presale, where analysts predict the price will hit $0.0006, and your initial $25K would be worth a jaw-dropping $300,000. Not bad, right? BTFD’s presale journey has been nothing short of meteoric, with the first 25% of its 16-stage presale completed within 24 hours. If you’ve been waiting for a sign to get in, this is it. Dogwifhat: Quirky, Bold, and Stealing the Spotlight Meme coins are all about personality, and Dogwifhat has that in spades. This quirky project has captured the hearts of crypto enthusiasts with its offbeat concept and a community that’s all-in on the fun. If you thought the meme coin space couldn’t get any weirder—in the best way possible—Dogwifhat is here to prove you wrong. At its core, Dogwifhat embraces the chaos of internet culture, using its unique branding to stand out in an oversaturated market. But don’t mistake it for just another meme. This coin comes with some surprising substance, including a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) model that gives holders a say in the project’s future direction. It’s a move that not only engages the community but also empowers it. Dogwifhat has also been making moves on social media, leveraging platforms like TikTok and Instagram to go viral. Its meme game is on point, and its roadmap includes partnerships with influencers to further its reach. If you’re looking for a project that’s as entertaining as it is promising, Dogwifhat could be your next big play. With a relatively low market cap and a growing community, Dogwifhat has room to grow. The project’s developers have hinted at upcoming utilities that could drive even more interest, including a potential NFT collection. If Dogwifhat keeps up its current momentum, it could easily become one of the best meme coins to buy this weekend. Floki Inu: The Veteran Meme Coin with a Solid Strategy No list of meme coins would be complete without Floki Inu, one of the OGs in the space. While newer projects like BTFD Coin and Dogwifhat are grabbing headlines, Floki Inu remains a force to be reckoned with. Known for its Elon Musk-inspired origins, this coin has evolved beyond its meme roots to offer real utility and a loyal fan base. Floki Inu’s recent market moves are worth watching. The project has been doubling down on its utility, with initiatives like FlokiFi, a decentralised finance (DeFi) ecosystem that includes staking and lending. These features are designed to attract serious investors who want more than just memes. What’s more, Floki Inu’s community continues to be one of the most active in the crypto world. From trending hashtags to viral campaigns, Floki’s marketing machine is a well-oiled beast. The coin has also been making strides in partnerships, including collaborations with global brands to boost its visibility. For investors, Floki Inu offers a mix of nostalgia and innovation. It’s a veteran in the meme coin space, but it’s constantly evolving to stay relevant. If you’re considering the best meme coins to buy this weekend, Floki Inu deserves a spot on your radar. Conclusion: Join the BTFD Coin Presale Now Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin, Dogwifhat, and Floki Inu are three of the best meme coins to buy this weekend. While all three have their unique appeal, BTFD Coin’s explosive presale performance and innovative features make it the standout option. With over $3.4 million already raised and a projected listing price of $0.0006, the potential returns are massive. The window of opportunity won’t stay open forever. Don’t miss your chance to ride the wave—join the BTFD Coin presale today and position yourself for potential gains that could redefine your portfolio.

37547777,https://crypto.news/?p=14318830,1734016322,Ethereum derivatives have mixed performance against Bitcoin: Bybit,"Bybit and analytics firm Block Scholes released a derivatives market report indicating mixed signals for Ethereum and Bitcoin. The report highlights a decline in Ethereum’s ( ETH ) perpetual open interest, primarily due to the liquidation of overleveraged long positions. These positions had accumulated during a period of optimism but were reset by falling ETH spot prices, according to the report shared with crypto.news. The report also notes that ETH futures contracts have not experienced the same decline in open interest as ETH perpetual swap contracts during a brief pause in upward price momentum. However, positioning has increased for both ( BTC ) and ETH. Despite this uptick, the overall size of open positions has not yet recovered from the expiration of approximately $20 million in contracts at the end of November 2024. This indicates that traders who held November-expiring contracts have not returned to the market with the same volume. In contrast, BTC perpetual positions have remained stable, even after a recent pullback from a high of over $100,000. Perpetual swaps are a type of derivatives contract that enables traders to speculate on an asset’s price without owning it. They are widely used in crypto markets, but unfavorable price movements can force leveraged traders into liquidation, reducing market activity.

However, trading volumes have decreased, reflecting a general sense of caution in the market. The options term structure for ETH shows higher realized volatility compared to future expectations, signaling a difference in sentiment from BTC, which displays a flatter term structure.

37551825,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/will-shiba-inu-shib-break-barriers-or-get-outpaced-by-lightchain-ai-trailblazing-moves,1734016279,Will Shiba Inu (SHIB) Break Barriers or Get Outpaced by Lightchain AI Trailblazing Moves,"The crypto world is buzzing with activity as Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to ride waves of popularity in the meme coin market. Initially launched as a playful competitor to Dogecoin, SHIB has evolved into a serious player in the decentralized ecosystem, complete with its own innovations like ShibaSwap and the upcoming Shibarium Layer-2 solution. However, the emergence of Lightchain AI (LCAI) introduces a new challenge for Shiba Inu, as the latter brings advanced blockchain solutions integrated with artificial intelligence to the forefront of crypto innovation. In this article, we’ll explore whether Shiba Inu has the potential to sustain its momentum and break through existing barriers or if Lightchain AI’s cutting-edge approach will leave the meme coin phenomenon trailing behind. By delving into the strengths and challenges of both platforms, we aim to shed light on the future of decentralized ecosystems. Overview Of Shiba Inu Shiba Inu has gained widespread attention due to its cute and meme-inspired branding, clever marketing tactics, and unique features. Launched in 2020 by an anonymous founder known as ""Ryoshi,"" SHIB aimed to capitalize on the success of Dogecoin by creating a similar platform with improved functionality. One of the key innovations of SHIB is the creation of ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows users to trade tokens within the Shiba Inu ecosystem without paying high gas fees. This feature effectively addresses one of the major pain points for users in accessing DeFi protocols. Additionally, ShibaSwap offers staking rewards for liquidity providers through its ""Bone"" token, which can be earned by providing liquidity to the exchange. This incentivizes users to contribute to the liquidity pool and helps maintain a healthy trading environment. Furthermore, Shiba Inu is gearing up for the launch of Shibarium, a Layer-2 solution that aims to improve scalability and reduce transaction costs within the network. This will allow SHIB to handle a higher volume of transactions and potentially attract more users to the ecosystem. Breaking Barriers: Shiba Inu’s Potential 1. The Promise of Shibarium Shibarium is a pivotal addition to SHIB’s ecosystem, aiming to improve transaction speeds and reduce fees. This upgrade could attract more developers and users, making Shiba Inu a more versatile blockchain. 2. Community-Driven Growth Shiba Inu’s strong community is its biggest asset. By fostering a participatory culture, SHIB has maintained relevance and expanded its ecosystem. 3. Expanding Ecosystem Beyond ShibaSwap and Shibarium, SHIB’s venture into NFTs and token burning initiatives shows promise. If leveraged effectively, these components could help SHIB compete with platforms offering more advanced technology. Can Shiba Inu Keep Up with Lightchain AI? Shiba Inu has been a prominent player in the crypto space, but with the emergence of innovative platforms like Lightchain AI (LCAI), the competition is heating up. Lightchain AI combines blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, offering a groundbreaking approach that could redefine the decentralized ecosystem. Here’s what sets Lightchain AI apart and why it poses a serious challenge for Shiba Inu: Game-Changing Consensus Mechanism Lightchain AI’s Proof of Intelligence (PoI) model rewards nodes for meaningful AI computations, such as model training. This not only accelerates decentralized AI development but also ensures energy efficiency and scalability, a leap beyond traditional consensus mechanisms. AI-Powered Virtual Machine The Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) is a dedicated layer optimized for executing AI tasks in real time. Its compatibility with frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch makes Lightchain AI a leader in AI-driven blockchain functionality. Real-World Applications Targeting industries like healthcare, finance, and supply chain, Lightchain AI offers privacy-focused, decentralized AI solutions. With features like federated learning and decentralized governance, it addresses critical problems while encouraging global adoption. Sustainability Meets Scalability Energy-efficient technologies like sharding, Layer 2 solutions, and DAG structures enable Lightchain AI to handle large-scale AI workloads without sacrificing performance, making it a sustainable option compared to traditional crypto approaches. Innovative Tokenomics The LCAI token fuels the ecosystem with uses like payments, staking, governance, and premium features. Deflationary mechanisms ensure long-term token value and sustainability, a model that could outshine Shiba Inu’s more speculative token structure. Visionary Roadmap With a strong focus on testnet rollouts, partnerships, and community-driven innovation, Lightchain AI’s roadmap points to long-term success in the AI-blockchain space. While Shiba Inu has built a strong community and a meme-driven culture, Lightchain AI introduces a utility-focused model that could disrupt the market. The question is: can Shiba Inu evolve quickly enough to compete with the advanced technology and real-world use cases of platforms like Lightchain AI? Only time will tell. Lightchain AI’s Trailblazing Moves 1. AI-Driven Applications Lightchain AI’s AIVM transforms blockchain functionality by enabling advanced applications: Dynamic NFTs:AI-powered NFTs that evolve based on user interaction or real-world data. Predictive DeFi Tools:AI-driven analytics for risk management and yield optimization in DeFi. Decentralized AI Research:A platform for collaborative AI model training while preserving data privacy. 2. Sustainability and Scalability Proof of Intelligence (PoI) ensures that Lightchain AI is not just efficient but also eco-friendly. By eliminating wasteful computations, the platform supports high throughput while maintaining a low environmental footprint. 3. Enhancing Existing Blockchains Lightchain AI doesn’t compete directly with platforms like Ethereum or Shiba Inu; instead, it enhances their capabilities through interoperability. Developers can integrate Lightchain AI’s tools into existing ecosystems, expanding their utility. The Future of Decentralized Ecosystems Shiba Inu’s Path Forward To remain competitive, Shiba Inu must: Fully leverage Shibarium’s capabilities to improve scalability and reduce costs. Expand its ecosystem to include innovative applications beyond token swaps and NFTs. Strengthen partnerships with other blockchain platforms to enhance its utility. Lightchain AI’s Role in the Blockchain Revolution Lightchain AI is well-positioned to lead the next wave of blockchain innovation. By integrating AI into blockchain operations, it offers a unique approach that complements existing platforms while addressing their limitations. Conclusion: Will Shiba Inu Break Barriers? Shiba Inu’s journey from a meme coin to a decentralized ecosystem highlights its resilience and potential. However, as blockchain technology advances, platforms like Lightchain AI set a new standard for scalability, utility, and sustainability. While SHIB’s community-driven growth remains impressive, it must adapt quickly to stay relevant in a rapidly evolving landscape. Lightchain AI’s visionary approach, centered around AI integration and meaningful innovation, positions it as a trailblazer in the blockchain space. Whether Shiba Inu can break barriers or Lightchain AI will outpace it remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the future of blockchain is both dynamic and unpredictable.

Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Meme Coin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain. It was inspired by Dogecoin and launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi. SHIB started with 1 quadrillion tokens; half were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a significant amount to the India Covid Relief Fund and burned 40% of the supply. Running on Ethereum allows SHIB to work with decentralized applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. Plans include a future NFT platform and a governance system based on a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). This integration with Ethereum gives SHIB potential utility beyond being a meme coin, which may make it attractive in the current market cycle. Conclusion Catzilla positions itself as a top contender among meme coins, surpassing SHIB and others in short-term potential. With a projected 700% ROI during its presale, starting at $0.0002 and increasing over 14 stages, and offering triple utility features, it aims to bring financial freedom to holders. By uniting its community, Catzilla seeks to overcome challenges and achieve new milestones.

37547630,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=661754,1734016071,From Presale Pick to Market Star: PEPU’s 500% Gain and WEPE’s Promise,"Holders of $PEPU – the new Pepe Unchained meme coin listing – will be smiling today. In just two days since its December, 10 launch, $PEPU’s market capitalization has sky rocketed to above the $480M mark. That’s a meteoric 500% gain. Bullish much? Pepe Unchained is certainly proving its mettle as one of the best new meme coins of the year . At the time of its DEX listing, 1 $PEPU cost $0.004638. The figure has now currently stands around $0.04905, with a 24-hour trading volume of an impressive $37.52M. Not too shabby at all, considering it entered the scene at a presale price of $0.008. Will Pepe Unchained reach its $1bn market capitalization goal? It’s too early to tell, of course, but the signs are looking good. So good, in fact, we expect to see CEXs getting on the action very soon. Pepe Unchained brings to the table a powerful Layer 2 blockchain ecosystem – purpose-built to foster meme-driven innovation at double the speed of Ethereum, and with lower fees. And soon to come is the Pepe Unchained Pump Pad – a pretty cool meme coin launcher. With no coding involved, the Pump Pad is a great way for novices and those-in-the-know alike to create and launch their own meme coins. It is also likely to pump up Pepe Unchained’s revenue. $PEPU’s X following (formerly Twitter) stands at an impressive 81k+. Speaking of, guess who’s been showing up in the personal feed of X head honcho and future President of the World, Elon Musk ? Coincidence? Or a fan of $PEPU? The jury is still out on that one. But if it walks like a duck… The Pepe brethren set to be one of 2024’s top presales $PEPU isn’t the only Pepe token making headlines. Pepe Unchained’s financial froggy kin, Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) , is killing it in its presale stage. Wall Street Pepe raised $100k within five hours of launching its presale on December, 3. Within three days, it hit the $1M mark. And now, less than 10 days down the line, $WEPE has raised more than $6.8M. $WEPE tokens are being snatched up faster than frog legs at a French restaurant. Wall Street Pepe’s secret? Galvanizing an army of crypto underdogs to take back power from the whales – hiding in insider groups – who control the crypto markets. With a strategy to “turn frogs into whales,” Wall Street Pepe promises token holders access to exclusive trading insights, guiding them in their crypto market journey. And, as members of the $WEPE army, traders will be able to share knowledge, engage in discussions and receive key updates from Wall Street Pepe. Despite $WEPE’s tough Wolf of Wall Street exterior, this meme coin is backed by good intentions – empowering the little guy to play among the big boys, with equal opportunities for vast wealth creation. If you don’t have a crypto wallet, you may want to consider the Best Wallet app . It’s a really easy way to buy and store your crypto. It’s also fully non-custodial – the control is all yours, and not centralized companies or exchanges. The $WEPE presale site has a convenient link to Best Wallet. The Wall Street Pepe presale is currently underway, so there’s still time to join the fast-growing $WEPE army at a fantastically low price. That said, its current cost of $0.000212 is set to increase in less than four days. As always, don’t forget to DYOR research. A visit to Wall Street Pepe’s X page is a good start.

Detailed Recap,"The Lightchain AI Presale is now live, offering an exclusive opportunity to join its innovative ecosystem at Lightchain AI . As the crypto market evolves, the battle between Pepe Coin and Lightchain AI highlights contrasting paths to crypto success. Pepe Coin, driven by meme culture and community buzz, struggles to establish lasting utility and scalability. In contrast, Lightchain AI is pioneering the integration of blockchain with AI, featuring groundbreaking technologies like Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). This detailed recap delves into which project is shaping up to lead crypto’s next big leap in innovation. Snapshot the Lightchain AI and Pepe Coin Pepe Coin, launched in 2017, is a meme-inspired cryptocurrency based on the popular Pepe the Frog character. It gained initial traction through its unique branding and community-driven approach. However, its value has since fluctuated significantly due to lack of utility and reliance on hype. On the other hand, Lightchain AI’s innovative platform is built to solve major challenges in both blockchain and AI fields. Its presale offers early access to secure LCAI tokens, which can be purchased with ETH using trusted platforms like Ramp Network and Transak. With a minimum purchase of $50 worth of ETH, investors can participate in shaping the future of decentralized AI. Also, Lightchain AI’s collaboration with industry leaders like IBM and Intel further solidifies its position as a leading player in the convergence of blockchain and AI. Market Performance of Pepe Coin As of December 11, 2024, Pepe Coin (PEPE) is trading at $0.000024, with a market capitalization of approximately $9.93 billion. Over the past month, PEPE has experienced a significant surge, reaching an all-time high of $0.00002803 on December 9, 2024. This growth is attributed to increased investor interest and community engagement. However, PEPE's market performance remains highly volatile, with its value heavily influenced by social media trends and speculative trading. Recent developments, such as Binance's announcement to cease trading pairs for PEPE on December 13, 2024, have introduced additional uncertainty, potentially impacting its short-term performance. Investors should exercise caution, considering the inherent risks associated with meme coins like PEPE. Market Performance of Lightchain AI As of December 11, 2024, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is trading at approximately $0.008589, with a market capitalization of $8,589 and a 24-hour trading volume of $496. The token's presale phase has garnered significant attention, raising over $300,000 within the first 24 hours. Analysts project a potential 3,500% increase, suggesting LCAI could reach $1 by the end of 2024. This optimism stems from Lightchain AI's innovative integration of artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, particularly through its Proof of Intelligence consensus mechanism and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine. These advancements position Lightchain AI as a promising player in the decentralized AI sector. However, as with any emerging cryptocurrency, market performance is subject to volatility, and investors should exercise caution. Comparative Analysis of Lightchain AI and Pepe Coin Now, let's dive into the comparative analysis of Lightchain AI and Pepe Coin to determine which project has a stronger potential for long-term success. Utility While Pepe Coin gained initial traction through its unique branding and community-driven approach, it lacks significant utility beyond being a meme coin. Its value is largely influenced by social media trends and speculative trading, making it highly volatile. On the other hand, Lightchain AI is built to solve major challenges in both blockchain and AI fields. It offers an ecosystem where individuals, developers, and organizations can collaborate without the constraints of centralized control. This clear utility gives Lightchain AI a strong advantage over Pepe Coin. Technology Pepe Coin relies on a basic blockchain infrastructure, limiting its potential for scalability and innovation. In contrast, Lightchain AI features groundbreaking technologies like Proof of Intelligence consensus and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine, which enable efficient and sustainable decentralized AI solutions. These advancements not only set Lightchain AI apart from Pepe Coin but also position it as a leader in the convergence of blockchain and artificial intelligence. Governance Model Pepe Coin operates on a community-driven governance model, where decisions are driven by community input and consensus. While this may seem democratic, it can result in slow decision-making processes and lack of accountability. On the other hand, Lightchain AI's inclusive governance model incorporates both centralized decision-making by experts in the field and decentralized decision-making by token holders. This balance ensures efficient decision-making and accountability. Partnerships Lightchain AI has established strategic partnerships with industry leaders like IBM and Intel, providing access to cutting-edge technology and expertise. On the other hand, Pepe Coin's partnerships are primarily limited to community-driven collaborations, which may not provide significant value in terms of innovation and growth. Market Performance While both Lightchain AI and Pepe Coin have seen significant growth in their market performance, Lightchain AI's potential for long-term success is stronger. Its presale phase has garnered attention from investors and analysts alike, with projections of a 3,500% increase. Additionally, its strong technological foundation and partnerships provide a stable foundation for sustained growth. In contrast, Pepe Coin's market performance is heavily influenced by social media trends and speculative trading, making it highly volatile. Recent developments, such as Binance's announcement to cease trading pairs for PEPE, have also introduced uncertainty in its short-term performance. Based on these factors, Lightchain AI emerges as the stronger project with more potential for long-term success than Pepe Coin. Its clear utility, advanced technology, inclusive governance model, and strategic partnerships position it as a leading player in the convergence of blockchain and artificial intelligence. Is the Moon For Lightchain AI? While it's impossible to predict the future, Lightchain AI's potential for sustained growth and innovation is evident. Its groundbreaking technologies and strategic partnerships have laid a strong foundation for long-term success. Additionally, as more industries and organizations recognize the value of decentralized AI solutions, demand for Lightchain AI's services is expected to increase. However, as with any emerging cryptocurrency, market performance is subject to volatility, and investors should exercise caution. The ultimate moon for Lightchain AI will depend on various factors such as adoption rate, competition, regulatory changes, and technological advancements. Why Lightchain AI Features Attract Investors Groundbreaking technologies: Lightchain AI's Proof of Intelligence consensus mechanism and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine have garnered attention from both investors and industry experts, positioning it as a leader in the convergence of blockchain and artificial intelligence. Strategic partnerships: Partnerships with established companies like IBM and Intel provide access to cutting-edge technology and expertise, giving investors confidence in Lightchain AI's potential for sustained growth. Clear utility: Unlike other meme coins, Lightchain AI offers a clear utility that solves major challenges in the blockchain and AI fields. This gives investors confidence in its long-term viability. Inclusive governance model: The combination of centralized decision-making by experts and decentralized decision-making by token holders ensure efficient decision-making and accountability, which is attractive to potential investors. Promising market performance: With projections of a 3,500% increase in its presale phase and a strong foundation for sustained growth, Lightchain AI's potential for long-term success is evident, making it an attractive investment opportunity. These factors, along with Lightchain AI's vision of creating a decentralized ecosystem for collaboration and innovation, make it an attractive project for investors with a long-term mindset. While the moon for Lightchain AI may not be reached overnight, its strong fundamentals position it as a promising project in the cryptocurrency market. Final Thoughts Pepe Coin and Lightchain AI each bring unique strengths to the table, with Pepe Coin capitalizing on its memetic appeal and community-driven momentum. However, Lightchain AI's forward-thinking technologies, such as Proof of Intelligence and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine, signal its ambition to redefine the blockchain landscape. While Pepe Coin thrives on cultural relevance, Lightchain AI’s emphasis on innovation and utility positions it to potentially lead crypto’s next evolutionary leap. Ultimately, success in this space will favor those who prioritize adaptability and groundbreaking advancements, leaving the future wide open.

37547834,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626575,1734016040,Ukraine will legalize crypto in the first quarter of 2025,"Cryptocurrency will finally go legit in Ukraine in the first quarter of 2025. But before anyone gets starry-eyed, here’s the catch: tax exemptions are off the table . Profits will face the same treatment as securities, with taxes applied only when crypto assets are converted into cold, hard fiat. This revelation came straight from Danylo Hetmantsev, head of Ukraine’s Parliamentary Committee for Finances, Tax, and Customs Policy, during the Domestic Investment Opportunities forum. Hetmantsev confirmed that lawmakers, alongside the National Bank and the IMF, are finalizing a draft law for its first reading. “ The text will be ready after the New Year. We aim to pass this law and legalize cryptocurrency in 2025 ,” he said. Ukraine’s decade-long crypto evolution Ukraine’s relationship with cryptocurrency has been a saga. Back in 2014, the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) outright dismissed Bitcoin, calling it a “money surrogate.” They banned it for payments, citing risks tied to anonymity and a lack of regulation. It was a clear no-go from the government. Fast forward to 2017, and things started to change a little bit. Ukraine proposed its first draft law to recognize crypto as property and set up tax guidelines for trading and mining. But nothing came of it. The situation remained murky until 2021 when the Verkhovna Rada —the country’s parliament—decided to legalize virtual assets. Even then, the road was far from smooth. In 2022, lawmakers drafted another law to refine crypto regulations. But President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vetoed it, sending officials back to square one. The government pressed on, and by 2023, they registered a new draft addressing industry concerns and setting the stage for what’s now unfolding. Crypto as a lifeline in an unstable economy Ukraine’s crypto adoption numbers are quite impressive. Between July 2023 and June 2024, the country raked in $106.1 billion in crypto inflows, according to Chainalysis. That makes Ukraine one of Eastern Europe’s top players, right alongside Russia. With the hryvnia battered by inflation and the war, Ukrainians turned to crypto as a financial lifeboat. Decentralized exchanges (DEXes) in the country saw a 160% spike in activity, pulling in $34.9 billion over the past year. People needed stability, and Bitcoin and other digital assets provided just that. Institutional investments poured in too. Amid the chaos of war, crypto offered a way to move money, bypass traditional banking systems, and weather economic uncertainty. Officials see crypto as more than a stopgap. It’s a cornerstone of their strategy to rebuild the economy post-war. Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s Minister of Digital Transformation, has been open about the role crypto can play in attracting investments and supporting growth. The draft law expected in early 2025 will align with Europe’s MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulations. It is the final step toward legitimizing a booming sector already embedded in the country’s economy.

The coin's development emphasizes solving existing market challenges, making it an interesting addition to the cryptocurrency landscape. Dogwifhat (WIF): A New Dog-Themed Meme Coin on the Solana Blockchain Dogwifhat (WIF) is a new meme coin gaining popularity on the Solana blockchain, inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme. As part of the growing trend of dog-themed tokens in the cryptocurrency space, WIF aims to build a community centered around fun and shared interests. Meme coins like WIF differ from traditional cryptocurrencies by focusing on community engagement and viral appeal. The use of Solana's technology allows for fast transactions and low fees, which could enhance the usability of WIF. In the current market cycle, the interest in meme coins suggests potential for growth, but their value can be highly volatile. WIF's unique theme and platform may attract users interested in the meme coin phenomenon. Turbo Token: The First AI-Created Memecoin Turbo Token is the first memecoin created by artificial intelligence. Conceived as an experiment in cryptocurrency development, the founder used GPT-4 to design and launch the coin. This project demonstrates how AI can contribute to creating digital assets. As a memecoin made by AI for the people, it merges technology with community engagement. The potential of Turbo Token lies in its unique origin and the growing interest in AI applications. Its attractiveness in the current market cycle depends on factors like market trends and investor interest. Turbo Token represents a new approach in the crypto space, highlighting the fusion of AI and blockchain technology. NEIRO: The Community-Driven Token Inspired by Doge's Legacy Neiro is a new cryptocurrency token on the Ethereum blockchain, honoring Neiro, the Shiba Inu adopted by the owner of Kabosu, the original Doge meme dog. This project pays homage to Neiro and is entirely owned and managed by its loving community. As the first Neiro token on Ethereum, it continues the spirit of unity that made Doge famous. The coin aims to bring people together and celebrate shared interests. In the current market cycle, community-driven tokens like NEIRO may attract interest due to their cultural significance and grassroots support. Conclusion While POPCAT, WIF, TURBO, and NEIRO show promise, their short-term potential appears limited. Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero, aiming to bring financial freedom to everyone. Offering a remarkable 700% ROI during its presale and triple utility features, it invites enthusiasts to join the fight against crypto villains and achieve new heights together.

37547571,https://coinpaprika.com/news/spicy-projects-4-vertex-protocol,1734015849,Spicy Projects #4: Vertex Protocol,"Today, we’re diving into Vertex Protocol, a decentralized exchange ( DEX ) that’s reimagining how we trade crypto. Combining spot trading, perpetual contracts, and decentralized lending, Vertex is creating a seamless, efficient, and secure trading experience. What Makes Vertex Stand Out? Vertex Protocol isn’t just another DEX—it’s a full financial ecosystem in one app. It allows you to trade spot markets, engage in perpetual contracts, and even lend or borrow crypto all in one place. No need to jump between different platforms; everything you need is available in a single, easy-to-use interface. “The goal of Vertex is to make trading fast and efficient while keeping everything decentralized and secure,” says a member of the Vertex team. With its unique features, Vertex gives users the ability to maximize their assets by combining trading with lending, allowing for more capital-efficient strategies. This setup makes it ideal for those who want to use their crypto in smarter ways. The Future of On-Chain Trading Vertex has ambitious goals for the future. The team aims to build ""the first synchronous network of decentralized exchanges,"" offering a unified liquidity layer across different chains. This will allow for easier trading of assets across multiple blockchains. As the team puts it, ""Future plans focus on expanding to multiple Layer 2 networks, optimizing user experience with new features, and solidifying itself as the ultimate on-chain trading venue for all traders."" The shift to Layer 2 networks will significantly improve transaction speed and lower costs for traders, positioning Vertex as a key player in the decentralized exchange space. Why Traders Are Excited About Vertex One of the most exciting aspects of Vertex is its capital efficiency.

Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trumps-tariffs-trumptar-solana-memecoin-will-explode-over-16000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Data collected from crypto price tracking websites revealed that Verge (XVG) rose by 37.4% across 24 hours, with Zcash (ZEC) and Monero (XMR) also posting significant gains, up 15.4% and 12.3%, respectively. Privacy Coin Resurgence The sector repeated the feat on December 12, with figures from CoinGecko indicating that privacy coins have increased 10.3% over the past day. At the time of writing, their combined value stood at $7.53 billion, with NuCypher (NU) leading the pack of gainers. Its price had jumped 85.6% to $0.1805, with Verge climbing 51.8% to reach $0.01704. Additionally, XVG’s trading volume skyrocketed to $361 million, the highest among its peers. Collectively, the category recorded a 24-hour trading volume of $908.6 million, an improvement of more than $262 million over the previous day, when it raked in about $646 million. Many of the higher-capped tokens registered more modest upticks, with XMR gaining an extra 5.7% on its price, pushing its market value to $3.6 billion. At $197.22, the coin also experienced a surge in its one-day trading volume, which hit $147 million, indicating substantial volatility yet strong investor appetite. On its part, ZEC went up 6.9% in 24 hours to trade at $64.33, while Dash (DASH) grew by 5.5% in the same period and is currently changing hands at $49.61. Across seven days, the little-known Cloakcoin (CLOAK) posted the biggest returns, jumping more than 104%. However, most of the more popular privacy coins were in the red in that timeframe, with Dash down 13.5%. ZEC also registered an 11.4% loss, while Verge dropped 6.7% from its previous price. Monero’s retraction over the week was much less significant at only 0.8%. Monero, Zcash, Catching a Bad Rep Privacy coins allow users to move funds confidentially using advanced cryptographic techniques and technologies, including ring signatures and stealth addresses. However, their ability to obscure transactions has put them on the radar of law enforcement authorities in several jurisdictions. In July, financial regulators in Dubai prohibited any transactions involving several such cryptocurrencies, including XMR and ZEC. This was intended to help prevent bad actors from leveraging them for money laundering and insider trading activities. Similarly, in 2018, Japan’s financial watchdog warned against using privacy coins, causing major exchanges such as Huobi and Bittrex to delist them. Earlier in the year, crime prevention units in the country apprehended 18 suspected scammers after analyzing their XMR transactions. The group is alleged to have conducted more than 900 money laundering transactions worth $670,000 using Monero.

Local media outlet Australian Financial Review (AFR) reports today that AMP invested $27 million in Bitcoin as part of its diversification strategy. The investment represents 0.05% of AMP’s total funds worth $57 billion.It bears mentioning that the company made the investment in May when Bitcoin was trading at around $60,000. However, the price has skyrocketed above the $100,000 mark ever since, netting the superannuation fund a profit of 66.66%.AMP Execs React, Say Bitcoin Potential Is Too Big to Ignore Although AMP invested in Bitcoin earlier this year, the move became public knowledge recently following a LinkedIn post from the company’s Senior Portfolio Manager, Steve Flegg.Notably, Flegg characterized the investment as ‘taking the plunge’ as Bitcoin looked to wrap up an outstanding year. The investment comes as most fund managers in the retirement savings sectors are ignoring Bitcoin due to its volatility. Explaining the motive behind AMP’s Bitcoin investment, Flegg pointed out that BTC’s potential has become too big to ignore despite the risk associated with the asset. Anna Shelly, AMP’s Chief Investment Officer, also commented on the bold move, indicating that it is part of the company’s diversification strategy. She pointed out that the investment was also driven by the sentiment and momentum associated with the premier asset. Furthermore, she acknowledged the risk involved in crypto while pointing out that AMP’s users have benefitted from the investment decision. The CIO suggested that the company is cautious about being too exposed to crypto, as the $27 million allocated to Bitcoin marks its upper-risk limit in the asset class.Mixed Reactions Trail AMP Bitcoin Investment Meanwhile, the investment has triggered mixed reactions among financial experts. Some experts, like BTC Markets CEO Caroline Bowler, expressed enthusiasm about AMP’s Bitcoin investment.However, others, such as Westpac group chief economist Luci Ellis, did not comment directly on the AMP’s investment but criticized Bitcoin for failing to fulfill the functions of money and lacking income-generation potential. US Companies Embracing Bitcoin While most Australian companies are still skeptical about Bitcoin, their U.S. counterparts have been embracing the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap. These companies are doubling down on the asset following Donald Trump's re-election. In particular, MicroStrategy recently scooped another 21,550 Bitcoin worth $2.1 billion, bringing its total holdings to 423,650 BTC. At press time, Bitcoin trades at $100,877, marking a surge of 2.62% in the past 24 hours.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/12/australian-retirement-fund-amp-invests-in-27m-in-bitcoin-says-btc-potential-too-big-to-ignore/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=australian-retirement-fund-amp-invests-in-27m-in-bitcoin-says-btc-potential-too-big-to-ignore,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

As a “community coin,” it airdropped 50% of its supply to participants in Solana’s NFT and DeFi ecosystems. By mid-December 2023, BONK became the third-largest memecoin by market cap and gained over 10,000% year-to-date. Its integration into Solana’s ecosystem, including the launch of BonkSwap, a decentralized exchange, shows its potential. Despite challenges like a high total supply and volatility, BONK’s growth and involvement in a growing ecosystem make it an attractive option in the current market cycle. WIF: Dogwifhat Meme Coin on Solana Blockchain Gains Momentum Dogwifhat (WIF) is a new meme coin on the Solana blockchain, inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme. Meme coins are cryptocurrencies that come from internet memes or pop culture, focusing on community and fun. Dog-themed tokens are popular in the crypto space. WIF aims to gain popularity through its viral meme and community engagement. The Solana blockchain offers fast and low-cost transactions, which benefits WIF.

Its potential lies in combining a popular meme with advanced blockchain technology.

Its platform focuses on building trust and encouraging active participation from the community. In the current market cycle, POPCAT appears to be an attractive option for those seeking potential growth and a fresh start in the crypto space.

It seeks to capture the evolving meme culture within a digital compendium, ensuring each meme is preserved on the blockchain. The $BOME memecoin operates on Solana, with Arweave and IPFS serving as the primary storage for the Book of Meme. Future expansions plan to use Bitcoin inscriptions for immutable storage. This initiative strives to create a new form of decentralized social media and make memes unstoppable. In the current market cycle, BOME offers a unique blend of technology and culture that may interest those at the intersection of memes and blockchain. Conclusion During the 2024 bull run, DOGEN leads Solana memecoins with a 30,000% surge. While BONK, WIF, POPCAT, and BOME have less short-term potential, DOGEN embodies luxury and success. Following tokens like BONK, WIF, and POPCAT, it expects 700% growth by presale’s end and offers real benefits, building a community of alpha leaders.

37548503,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51932,1734015622,How Many Days In Bitcoin Price Hitting $150K: XRP Makes Strong Comeback While $3.9M IntelMarkets Defies Bears,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) journey to reaching $150K has become a hot topic, as analysts speculate when it might achieve this groundbreaking milestone. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) is making a strong return, bringing traders back to other crypto after a period of doubt. Amidst these big moves, a smaller yet significant story is unfolding. Amid these headline-grabbing stories, IntelMarkets stands out as a game-changer for traders seeking an edge in unpredictable markets. Its AI-powered tools, automated trading solutions, and unmatched performance metrics are redefining how trading is approached—offering users the efficiency and precision they need to stay ahead. Bitcoin (BTC) Edges Closer to the $150K Milestone On December 5, 2024, Bitcoin price broke the $100,000 mark, reaching an all-time high of $103,800. This milestone pushed the Bitcoin (BTC) market cap to $2 trillion, a major achievement in the world of digital assets. Predictions for Bitcoin price by the end of the year are positive, with many seeing it potentially hitting anywhere between $124,000 and $150,000. Moreover, experts note a significant breakout, suggesting that Bitcoin could rise to $130,000 in the coming weeks. Also, due to Its recent trading above the $100,000 mark, many are expecting even higher prices. Some analysts believe it could reach $150,000 by the end of December, with increased trading volume and strong support from both retail and institutional investors. Additionally, Bitcoin ETFs now hold over one million BTC, a sign that large investors are treating Bitcoin (BTC) as a serious asset. This shift in market behavior is likely to keep Bitcoin (BTC) on an upward trajectory, and $150,000 may be just the beginning. Ripple (XRP) Makes Waves as Altcoins Regain Momentum Ripple (XRP) has made significant strides after a lengthy four-year legal battle, emerging victorious with the approval of its stablecoin, RLUSD, by the NYDFS. With this launch, Ripple (XRP) plans to reestablish itself as a key player in institutional payments and the tokenization of real-world assets. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) price has risen over 12% over the last week, reaching $2.31. Its market cap now stands at $131 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $23 billion. The recent price increase is tied to Ripple’s positive news, but the real change will happen when Ripple introduces liquidity pools and automated market makers (AMMs) on the XRP Ledger. Right now, XRP is priced at about $2.35, but it’s having a hard time going past $2.53-$2.54. If it can break through that level, some people think it could go up to $5, which means there could be more growth. IntelMarkets Proves Resilience with $3.9M Achievement IntelMarkets has shown resilience with a $3.9 million achievement despite market challenges. The presale has surpassed $3,987,000, with tokens selling quickly. A standout feature is its dual-chain functionality, supporting both the Ethereum and Solana blockchains.

Additionally, the platform introduces Route X21, a protocol designed to protect its ecosystem from quantum computing risks through advanced cryptographic techniques. The platform offers up to 1000x leverage for significant returns and features the INTL token for staking, governance, and fee reductions.

Bitcoin sidechain Sequentia co-founder Andreas Kohl reportedly exploited the “DogeReaper” vulnerability, causing 69% of nodes on the Dogecoin network to crash, Cointelegraph reported. https://twitter.com/aejkohl/status/1867078471190712741 On-chain data showed that before the exploitation, Dogecoin had a total of 647 active nodes, but the number of nodes dropped to 315 after the incident. Discovered by security researcher Tobias Ruck and disclosed by the DOGE Efficiency Department in early December, the “DogeReaper” vulnerability exploited by Kohl can remotely take down any Dogecoin node. It has been stated that this vulnerability could disrupt the entire Dogecoin network and could bring the entire network to a halt with no transactions or blocks created for several days if the vulnerability was exploited on a large scale by malicious parties. Despite the huge potential threat the vulnerability poses to the DOGE network, it was rated as low severity by the Coinbase Exchange, and researcher Tobias Ruck was only awarded a $200 bounty for his discovery. *This is not investment advice.

This selling pressure could impact the recovery and further price appreciation, absorbing a significant part of the incoming demand. Notably, the asset went through an aggressive correction after an impressive rally up to the 3rd position by market cap. XRP Ledger’s (XRPL) native token started crashing last week after dismissed rumors and concerning technical indicators , reaching the 4th position. Now, as XRP again struggles behind Tether’s USDT , its largest token holder, Ripple, has initiated a massive sell operation. On December 11, the company moved all the 200 million XRP reserved for December ’s budget, following Finbold’s warning last week. Repeating previous month’s pattern, Ripple (1) sent the tokens to ‘ rP4X2h(…) ’ that works as an intermediary address for its sales. This account also received 380 million XRP from Ripple (29) and moved 200 million tokens to Ripple (50) . Ripple (1) account summary.

Source: TradingView / Finbold / Vini Barbosa On November 29, XRP crossed the $100 billion market cap level, threatening to surpass Solana ( SOL ), as Finbold reported . A few days later, Ripple’s token reached a $165.74 billion all-time high capitalization, at $2.90 per XRP. This granted the asset the 3rd position, surpassing Solana and Tether’s USDT in all crypto market indexes, in an unprecedented move. On December 4, Finbold warned that technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) indicated a potential crash for XRP . The forecast consolidated, and the token crashed down to $2.00, primarily driven by Ripple dismissing RLUSD-related rumors. Despite some speculation, $RLUSD isn’t launching today. We’re in lockstep with the NYDFS on final approval and will share updates as soon as possible. We are fully committed to launching under the supervision of NYDFS and upholding the highest regulatory standards.

Should XRP maintain the strong momentum it has displayed since November, the digital asset could regain the 3rd position in crypto indexes. However, overall capital inflow into the cryptocurrency ecosystem can also boost Tether’s stablecoin capitalization, leveling up the game against XRP.

One of the top coins based on market cap is Shiba Inu, but its slow recovery is causing many investors to question its near-term potential. It actually dropped 16% in just 24 hours, struggling to breach critical resistance levels. This uncertainty has caused altcoin enthusiasts to explore other opportunities like VeChain(VET), currently valued at $0.05518. It is thriving due to its real-world applications in smart hospitals and NGO/enterprise partnerships. Meanwhile, 1Fuel (OFT), priced at $0.01 in its presale, has gained significant traction for its innovative ecosystem. This includes one-click cross-chain transactions via its DEX wallet. Will SHIB lead memecoins in 2025? As of now, Dogecoin is far ahead of any other memecoin in the crypto space. Its current value is $0.3979 and has a market cap of $58.55 billion. Dogecoin’s position as a leader remains strong due to its community backing and advancements in technology. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu is valued at $0.0000276 with a market cap of $16.26 billion, so it would take a lot of work and time before it can overtake Dogecoin. Shiba Inu is still one of the best crypto coins, especially with the development of Shibarium and its ecosystem. But for Shiba Inu to become the leader of memecoins, it has to surpass Dogecoin. This requires its market cap to rise by approximately 260.09%. Despite SHIB’s potential, it would be hard to dethrone DOGE as the leader of memecons. While some experts believe that SHIB could close the gap, surpassing DOGE would require a dramatic shift in market dynamics. Investors continue to hold the top two contenders on secure platforms like Ledger and Trust Wallet, but SHIB’s slow recovery has shed a spotlight on some alternatives. Is 1Fuel and Vechain undervalued? Both VeChain (VET) and 1Fuel (OFT) appear to be significantly undervalued, offering unique opportunities for growth and long-term potential as some of the best crypto coins. VeChain (VET) is currently priced at $0.05512 (at the time of writing) with a market cap of $4.46 billion. It experienced a strong surge to an all-time high of $0.07750 in December 2024. This was a remarkable 37% price increase after breaching critical resistance levels. Although VET experienced a dip from June to November 2024, it has shown a steady recovery, peaking in December. On the other hand, 1Fuel is significantly undervalued as you can see from its current presale price of $0.01. This is the lowest the price would ever be. Once the presale concludes, investors can expect massive price increases. 1Fuel has impressive use cases, especially in cross-chain management, which makes it a top DEX wallet. Unlike alternatives like Ledger and Trust Wallet, 1Fuel allows investors to interact with different blockchain systems through a single wallet. The one-click, peer-to-peer, cross-chain transactions are possible without the need for a third party on 1Fuel. This is unlike Ledger and Trust Wallet, which require manual management. These features position 1Fuel to become a dominant player in the crypto space, despite its undervalued price. Why do investors keep buying up OFT? Investors are rushing towards trading 1Fuel (OFT), evident in the rapid progress of its presale which surpassed 90% completion in a few days. It’s expected to conclude soon. Many investors decided to take advantage of the opportunity to purchase OFT at its lowest price ever. Beyond the attractive pricing, early investors also offer priority access to 1Fuel’s crypto card and exclusive bonuses. One of the key features fueling investor interest in 1Fuel is its comprehensive capabilities, which cause OFT to stand out as a utility token. The token is built on cross-chain management, which comes with the ability to make one-click transactions in a P2P marketplace. It also offers cold storage, AI-driven functionalities, and a crypto card. These make 1Fuel a top DEX wallet, and investors don’t want to miss out on OFT. For those considering alternatives, Ledger and Trust Wallet are notable options, but they typically require more manual management of digital assets which can be cumbersome for investors. In contrast, 1Fuel simplifies the process, offering a streamlined, all-in-one solution. One wallet for everything As the 1Fuel presale nears the end of Stage 1, the demand for the OFT token continues to rise, especially due to its low price, advanced features, and exclusive opportunities for early investors. 1Fuel has solidified its position among DEX wallets, since it will allow investors to interact with multiple blockchain systems from a single wallet. 1Fuel is set to become a game-changer in the world of decentralized finance and crypto investments.

Having started at $157.61 on the eve of the election, SOL rocketed 63.22% to $257.25 on November 21 before correcting toward $230 and entering a period of volatility and decline. SOL 6-month price chart. Source: Finbold Still, despite falling to $229.61 at press time on December 12, Solana remains 10.46% in the green in the last 30 days and 58.05% in the last 6 months, and cryptocurrency investors remain optimistic about the months to come. Under the circumstances, Finbold elected to consult ChatGPT-4o’s advanced artificial intelligence ( AI ) to try to determine whether the rally will reignite by December 31 or if traders will have an even better ‘buy the dip’ opportunity. ChatGPT sets SOL price target for December 31 Though it moderately misjudged Solana’s press time price, placing it at $231.49, ChatGPT quickly positively assessed the overall situation. Specifically, the AI identified a string of developments crucial for SOL to continue to enjoy strong tailwinds. Key factors driving Solana’s price action, per ChatGPT. Source: Finbold & ChatGPT-4o According to ChatGPT, these include the general crypto market momentum, institutional adoption, high network activity, technical developments and tools like Gameshift, and the positive investor sentiment generated by the anticipated regulatory changes and Bitcoin ( BTC ) hitting the $100,000 milestone. Still, the AI’s price target for December 31 proved rather conservative as it estimated that – at $250 – SOL will not reclaim its 2024 highs before the New Year. Solana price target for December 31, 2024, per ChatGPT. Source: Finbold & ChatGPT-4o Crypto analysts increasingly bullish about Solana If ChatGPT proved bullish but cautious about Solana’s future, various cryptocurrency analysts – whether prominent voices on X or community members – have recently become simply optimistic. Multiple examinations posted to TradingView by multiple prolific traders and experts, such as Shadowfigure , LOWCO_487 , and basictradingtv, have all, in recent days, acknowledged some uncertainty about SOL’s future direction but also all concluded that Solana is poised for a continued bull run. The analyses were based on numerous technical factors, including the token’s decisive consistency in trading above the 200-day simple moving average ( MA ), momentum in relation to critical support and resistance zones, volume, and the fact that – depending on the exact time frames used – Solana formed a string of positive patterns , including a bullish pennant and a bullish falling wedge . Still, perhaps the most positive assessment was shared by the popular on-chain analyst Ali Martinez, who, in a December 10 X post, opined that SOL formed a major ‘cup and handle’ pattern, set to eventually take the cryptocurrency all the way up to $4,000 – 1,642.08% above the press time price.

The multinational entertainment company is considering the acquisition to further bolster its extensive portfolio. Kodokawa’s acquisition is expected to dramatically affect the gaming and anime industries. Since its establishment in the 1940s, Sony, the multinational company, has expanded and adapted itself to move beyond its consumer electronics business. The company’s evolution has seen it veer into entertainment and gaming with movies and the creation of PlayStation consoles. In the same light, Sony has recently sought to expand its portfolio further with acquisitions that would boost its hold on entertainment and gaming while simultaneously diversifying its offerings. Sony eyes FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa Sony has confirmed their interest in buying FromSoftware's parent company Kadokawa. ""It’s true that we have made an initial statement of intent. We would appreciate it if you would allow us to refrain from further comment."" (Source: Yahoo Japan) pic.twitter.com/o0RXSDYAB8 — TripleJump Gaming (@TeamTripleJump) December 12, 2024 As initially reported by Reuters, Sony has been eyeing a potential move to acquire Kadokawa, a Japanese media conglomerate. It was rumored that Sony would be in talks to facilitate the Kadokawa acquisition before the company confirmed the news. The initial rumors were further solidified when Weekly Bunshun , a Japanese news site, shared the Japanese employee’s thoughts about the probable acquisition. Kadokawa is renowned for its role in film, publishing, and video game spheres. The Japanese conglomerate owns FromSoftware, the video game publisher behind the Souls and Elden Ring titles. Kadokawa is also prominently featured in the anime world and has many intellectual properties. The company’s extensive manga and anime portfolios established it as a key player. Several Kadokawa anime adaptations, such as Oshi no Ko , have gone on to give it massive financial success and boost its reputation. The Japanese company has also engaged in more anime-related activities, such as production financing and merchandising, giving it substantial sway over the global anime market. Kadokawa’s acquisition is perceived to result in sweeping changes in the anime and gaming industries. Sony is expected to follow trends set by other major players like Microsoft, who acquired Activision-Blizzard in a deal worth $68.7 billion in 2023. The proposed deal is expected to help boost Sony’s hold on the Japanese market and other emerging markets. The entertainment company currently owns Crunchyroll and Funimation, and the deal would give it more IPs, establishing it as an anime powerhouse with global reach. Sony’s potential acquisition causes mixed reactions News about the gaming empire acquiring Kadokawa resulted in a range of reactions from both gamers and industry players. Some Japanese employees under Kadokawa were critical of the deal and stated that it would severely impact the company’s independence. Another section of employees said the acquisition was positive and would rejuvenate the company by improving discipline and removing incompetent staff members. In this context, Takeshi Natsuno, CEO of Kadokawa, was singled out for potential replacement if the acquisition went through. A veteran Kadokawa employee said : “The employees around me are happy about Sony’s acquisition. That’s because there are a certain number of employees who are dissatisfied with the Natsuno administration, which did not even hold a press conference after personal information was leaked due to a cyber attack.” Gamers also reacted to Kadokawa’s potential acquisition by Sony with mixed reactions. Some gamers stated that the acquisition would be a perfect fit for Sony and would give the game publisher the best chance to keep going amidst industry uncertainty and the current struggles facing the Japanese company. However, another section of gamers expressed skepticism, fearing that the acquisition would make the Souls and Elden titles exclusive to Sony.

On Dec. 11, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed Nvidia’s appeal to throw out the case, issuing a one-line order without explanation. This decision reinstates a Ninth Circuit appellate court ruling that revived the lawsuit, which had previously been dismissed by a California district court in March 2021. The lawsuit, filed by Nvidia shareholders, claims the company concealed over $1 billion in GPU sales to crypto miners. It also accuses CEO Jensen Huang of downplaying the volume of these sales to the industry. “We would have preferred a decision on the merits affirming the trial court’s dismissal of the case, but we are fully prepared to continue our defense,” an Nvidia spokesperson told Cointelegraph. “Consistent and predictable standards in securities litigation are essential to protecting shareholders and ensuring a strong economy, and we remain committed to supporting them.” The shareholders allege that Nvidia’s revenue was significantly bolstered by crypto miners during the 2018 market boom. When the crypto market crashed later that year, Nvidia’s sales fell sharply, causing its share price to drop nearly 30% over two days. In its defense, Nvidia argued that the lawsuit relied on fabricated information about its business and income. However, the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission opposed Nvidia’s appeal, stating, “This is not what occurred here.” The investors’ case reportedly includes evidence such as statements from former Nvidia executives and a Bank of Canada report alleging the company understated its cryptocurrency revenue by $1.35 billion. In 2022, Nvidia paid $5.5 million to the SEC to settle charges related to inadequate disclosures about crypto mining’s impact on its gaming business, though it did not admit to or deny the findings.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/nvidia-faces-class-action-suit-over-crypto-mining-sales-claims/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The company building Perena, a stablecoin trading infrastructure project, raised ""around $3 million"" in a pre-seed funding round led by Borderless Capital, Yuan told CoinDesk in an interview last month.  Perena isn't solely focused on launching another stablecoin. Instead, it's creating on-chain systems that allow the seemingly endless droves of other stablecoin newcomers to have good trading liquidity, even in nascency.  That's the funny thing about stablecoins. While their exact backing recipes may slightly differ, most every stablecoin gets its value from essentially the same source: the U.S. dollar, the globally-recognized reserve currency. When dozens of fintech companies all have, essentially, their own digital version of the dollar, how will consumers, businesses, traders – anyone – move seamlessly between them?  ""If PayPal, Robinhood and 20 other companies want to launch stablecoins on Solana, they're going to have a really hard time getting any adoption, and those stablecoins are going to be any more usable than their fiat counterparts,"" she said.  ""We want to be the foundational layer – the neutral party that supports stablecoin issuers.""  The whole project is a bet that stablecoins will continue to grow in prominence – not only as a critical asset for traders speculating on cryptos, but as a store of value and medium of exchange, or, in other words, as money.  Yuan thinks that Solana's fast speeds and cheap fees can be a catalyst for yet more people to experiment with bringing more of their money on-chain via stablecoins. It helps that so many crypto jobs are paying staff with stablecoins. Payroll introduces people to the on-chain economy, and they aren't always so eager to offboard entirely.  Perena fits into this puzzle as a place of exchange. It is setting up swap pools that allow traders of up to seven different stablecoins to readily swap between assets – much like Curve's 3pool does on Ethereum. Yuan said stablecoin holders will be able to earn extra yield by lending their assets into the pool, earning more based on their risk tolerance.  Along the pool infrastructure, Perena plans to build a form of ""synthetic money"" that according to Yuan will be more resilient than the fiat currencies most people hold in their traditional bank accounts.  This will take the form of a ""collateralized debt position"" (CDP) stablecoin backed by other stablecoins – much like MakerDAO (now Sky) did with DAI. Perena hasn't finalized its design just yet but Yuan is hopeful that building a CDP next to a stableswap will create more ""synergies.""",POSITIVE,DAI,EXCHANGE | FIAT | SOL | TRADING | DAI,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/12/11/stablecoin-trading-startup-perena-tries-its-luck-on-solana,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c64dac521e0f21bc04d592fca479ab5fe816e6b9-3200x2133.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, the recent surge in demand suggests the correction might be over and SOL could regain momentum for a new all-time high (ATH) with another surge. Along with Solana, Toncoin (TON) and Cutoshi (CUTO) also exhibit excellent potential for reaching tremendous heights with a rally and thus experience an increased demand. Solana (SOL): Bearish Move With Huge Volume After the 60%+ rally in November, Solana reached a new ATH at $263.83 but faced significant resistance near the $264 price level. The demand quickly vanished and Solana lost momentum and corrected over 15% to the $221 price level. It then entered a consolidation and traded trapped between $221 and $246. Until last week, Solana had been moving in a triangle pattern, with the price getting more consolidated over time. However, on Monday, the price fell below the lower trendline of this pattern with a massive 8.6% intraday drop after weeks of slow price action. Solana had dropped to the $205 support level, where bulls applied significant pressure to stop the price from falling further. Over the last 24 hours, Solana price has plunged 5.2% to $216.97, but the daily trading volume has increased by 176%. Today, there is a balance between bearish and bullish pressure, resulting in a doji candlestick. Since the bulls have gained control, keeping the price above essential support, Solana might reverse from this zone and continue the previous uptrend. Toncoin (TON) Undergoes Massive Correction Since its ATH at $8.24 in June, Toncoin began declining due to the trendline. It broke out of the trendline on 9 November 2024 and surged over 35%. However, Toncoin faced much resistance at the $7 price level and consolidated below it for over a week. Like Solana, Toncoin plunged on Monday to $5.2, the price level at which it broke out of the declining trendline a month ago. Toncoin fell below the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) with this drop. With this price correction, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped to 44, and the MACD oscillator has moved below the signal line. The price has since risen over 10% and Toncoin trades at $5.89, back above this SMA. Toncoinhas immediate support at $5.7 and immediate resistance at $6.1. The price is currently 28% below the ATH and Toncoin might rally again after this correction is over to reach this ATH. Cutoshi (CUTO): Utility Meme Coin Set To Rival Solana Cutoshi is a hybrid token that offers all the fun aspects of a meme coin community and pairs it with the practical use cases of a DeFi utility token. This hybrid nature sets it apart from traditional meme coins, giving it an edge over the competition. It follows Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision of a decentralized economy that offers users privacy and monetary freedom. It has developed a DeFi ecosystem with practical features necessary for participating in decentralization. At the center of the ecosystem is the Cutoshi DEX (Decentralized Exchange), a multi-chain exchange where users can swap their digital assets peer-to-peer across various blockchains. Since it is cross-chain interoperable, users can access all their assets under a single platform and manage their finances efficiently without frequently changing platforms. The DEX offers almost instantaneous transfer speeds at a minimal 0.25% fee. Cutoshi uses 20% of these fees for the platform’s maintenance and liquidity providers and burns the rest to boost the native token’s value. The native token is CUTO, which is worth $0.031 in stage 4. Cutoshi has raised over $1.35 million in the presale and early investors who made enormous returns are now doubling down as the presale has more stages to compound gains before the launch.

Polkadot gains 84% this month despite recent dip: What’s next for DOT? Polkadot (DOT) has experienced a remarkable 84.23% increase over the past month, with its price currently ranging between $8.66 and $11.90. However, the past week saw a decline of 14.87%, indicating some short-term volatility. The 10-day Simple Moving Average stands at $8.50, while the 100-day SMA is at $10.13, suggesting mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 34.60, approaching oversold territory, which could signal a buying opportunity. The nearest resistance level is at $13.40; breaking above this could propel DOT toward the second resistance at $16.64, a potential gain of over 40% from current levels. Conversely, if the price falls, the nearest support is at $6.92. Conclusion In conclusion, while coins like DOT may have less immediate growth potential, CYBRO presents an exceptional opportunity for investors seeking significant short-term gains.

Solana’s impressive rebound to $201, driven by network upgrades and institutional interest, puts it on track for a potential surge to $250. Avalanche’s ecosystem expansion through subnets strengthens its position as a leader in blockchain customization and DeFi integration. However, Web3Bay is changing the game entirely, tackling real-world inefficiencies in e-commerce by eliminating costly intermediaries. With a presale starting at $0.003 and offering a 6430% ROI potential, Web3Bay isn’t just another token—it’s a transformative platform reshaping online shopping. Web3Bay Solves Real World Issue In e-Commerce; Start Accumulating 3BAY Now Web3Bay is tackling one of the biggest issues in e-commerce: high transaction costs. Traditional platforms often rely on intermediaries like payment processors and data brokers, which charge fees ranging from 2-5%. These costs are passed directly to users, making online shopping unnecessarily expensive. Web3Bay’s blockchain-based platform eliminates these intermediaries, replacing them with smart contracts that automate and secure transactions. The result? Significantly lower fees, greater efficiency, and a better deal for both buyers and sellers. For early investors, the cost-saving benefits are matched by incredible ROI potential. The 3BAY token presale starts at $0.003 per token, with a structured price increase of 15% per stage over 28 phases. By the final stage, tokens are expected to reach $0.1959—offering early supporters a potential ROI of 6430%. Web3Bay isn’t just reducing costs—it’s rewriting the rules of e-commerce. With its decentralized model, users can enjoy a transparent, secure shopping experience without the hidden fees and inefficiencies of traditional platforms. This cost-saving innovation positions Web3Bay as a leader in the Web3 revolution. Solana Rebounding with Network Upgrades and Institutional Interest Solana (SOL) has rebounded strongly, driven by recent network upgrades aimed at enhancing scalability and reducing transaction costs. These improvements have attracted increased institutional interest, with several investment firms expressing confidence in Solana's technology and potential for widespread adoption. Solana (SOL) has rebounded impressively, hitting $201, supported by network upgrades and institutional inflows. Known for its high transaction speeds and low fees, Solana has emerged as a go-to platform for DeFi and NFT projects. Analysts suggest that breaking the $220 resistance could push SOL to $250 in the short term. However, failure to sustain momentum might lead to a retracement to $180. Long-term price predictions for Solana indicate a target of $400 by 2025, reflecting its scalability and adoption in Web3. Avalanche (AVAX): Expanding with Subnet Deployments and DeFi Integration Avalanche (AVAX) has been expanding its ecosystem through the deployment of subnets, which allow for customized blockchain networks operating within the Avalanche platform. This flexibility has attracted various projects, particularly in the DeFi sector, seeking scalable and efficient solutions. Analysts believe AVAX could rally to $50 if it maintains its current trajectory. However, a drop below $30 could test support at $25. By 2025, AVAX is expected to reach $100, benefiting from increased adoption and the growing popularity of its decentralized applications and partnerships in the blockchain space. Conclusion Solana’s scalability and Avalanche’s customizable subnets reflect blockchain’s expanding possibilities, but Web3Bay takes innovation a step further by addressing real-world e-commerce challenges. With its decentralized platform reducing fees and enhancing transaction transparency, Web3Bay empowers users while delivering unparalleled ROI potential. Its presale rewards early investors and positions Web3Bay as a long-term leader in Web3 commerce. As the crypto market evolves, Web3Bay stands out as more than just a trend—it’s a future-proof investment that bridges blockchain utility with real-world impact.

According to a crypto analyst, XRP could reach three potential new price targets if it can break out of the Falling Wedge, with $2.8 being the highest target. Falling Wedge To Trigger XRP Price Surge To $2.8 The XRP price has been on a powerful uptrend in the past month, jumping from $0.5 to over $2 in just one month. Acknowledging this impressive performance, a crypto analyst on TradingView, known as ‘MBM_Crypto,’ has revealed that the XRP price has undergone a pullback and is currently “cooling off” in a Falling Wedge pattern after experiencing its massive upside move. Related Reading: Bitcoin CME Chart Shows Striking Similarities To 2023, Here’s What Happened Last Time A Falling Wedge is a technical chart pattern that indicates a potential price reversal to the upside. Typically seen as a bullish signal, this pattern often appears during a downtrend, featuring two converging trend lines sloping downwards. The TradingView analyst shared a chart detailing the XRP price action in a 2-hour time frame, highlighting the presence of a Falling Wedge pattern. The chart pointed out key areas where XRP is likely to encounter selling pressure, resistance, and indicate optimal buying levels for investors. The analyst suggests that purchasing XRP when its price breaks above $2.51 could be a strategic move, indicating a potential for a bullish breakout following the conclusion of its current consolidation phase. Additionally, he shared key take-profit targets for investors, suggesting that XRP was on track to potentially hit three bullish price milestones if it successfully breaks out of its Falling Wedge pattern. The first target for XRP is $2.6, followed by the second projected leap to $2.7, while the third and highest target is positioned at $2.8. For the XRP price to achieve these key price levels, the TradingView analyst has suggested that it will have to break above the blue resistance zone at $2.42, thus confirming a potential bullish continuation for the cryptocurrency. While the analyst is confident about his optimistic price projection, he has also acknowledged the possibility of a temporary pullback to $2.15 or even $1.96. Following this price correction, the crypto expert believes that XRP could eventually break out of the Falling Wedge and take off. Analyst Says XRP Is ”Super Bullish” Despite trading at $2.4 after experiencing a slight decline in the past weeks, analysts remain highly optimistic about XRP’s future price prospects. Dark Defender, a prominent crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), has declared that the XRP price is “super bullish” during this cycle. Related Reading: Solana Price At $4,000? Cup And Handle Pattern Shows Why This Is Possible The analyst observed that XRP is on the verge of finalizing the ABC Corrective Wave pattern in the daily time frame, signaling a potential reversal and the beginning of an uptrend. This pattern will be confirmed once XRP breaks the $2.52 level. Dark Defender has forecasted that the XRP price could exceed this level within 24 hours, triggering a path to the $5.85 target before potentially skyrocketing to $18.22.

The exploit, executed by Andreas Kohl, co-founder of Bitcoin sidechain Sequentia, demonstrated the network’s fragility and raised pressing questions about the robustness of cryptocurrency ecosystems. Oops I just did a thing and I think I might have just crashed more than half of all doge nodes… pic.twitter.com/04NcRtj5k1 — Andreas Kohl (@aejkohl) December 11, 2024 Using an old laptop in rural El Salvador, Kohl targeted a vulnerability previously disclosed by researcher Tobias Ruck. Before the attack, Dogecoin’s network boasted 647 active nodes, per Blockchair data . Following the exploit, the number of operational nodes plummeted to just 205, though it has since slightly recovered to 315, leaving the network functioning at reduced capacity. I used a publicly disclosed (by @TobiasRuck ) vulnerability to take down 69% of the Dogecoin network from an old thinkpad in rural el salvador. AMA. https://t.co/BNkGDWkWhu pic.twitter.com/qk16AwMaq5 — Andreas Kohl (@aejkohl) December 12, 2024 How Hacker Took Down Dogecoin Nodes With “Death Note” The vulnerability exploited by Kohl, dubbed “DogeReaper,” was first detailed on December 4 by the “Department of DOGE Efficiency,” an X account dedicated to Dogecoin-related updates. Public Re-Disclosure of ""DogeReaper"", a critical vulnerability in Dogecoin DogeReaper is a critical vulnerability on Dogecoin, allowing anyone to crash any Dogecoin node remotely. We are re-disclosing this vulnerability without links to make the X algo happy. pic.twitter.com/cbl3rOG2PD — Department Of DOGE Efficiency (@EfficiencyDOGE) December 6, 2024 The exploit was likened to the premise of the Japanese manga Death Note, where writing a person’s name causes their demise. Similarly, DogeReaper allowed anyone to target specific Dogecoin nodes and crash them through a segmentation fault—a critical error in which a program attempts to access restricted memory. The Department of DOGE Efficiency warned that the vulnerability could theoretically bring down the entire Dogecoin network. With node addresses publicly accessible, a determined attacker could halt transactions and block production, crippling the cryptocurrency for days. Dogecoin Not The First Amid Weak DeFi Security This event has spotlighted Dogecoin’s security practices, as the community criticized the negligence. Although Dogecoin developers had already released a patch addressing the DogeReaper vulnerability in version 1.14.9 of Dogecoin Core, most nodes—estimated at 87%—remained un-updated during the attack. Earlier this year, the Cardano blockchain experienced a similar attack, but Cardano successfully thwarted the attack , prompting developers to announce a node upgrade to enhance network security. The attack, which began at block 10,487,530, sought to exploit the network’s fee mechanism by overloading it with transactions executing 194 smart contracts each while spending just 0.9 ADA per transaction. The attacker aimed to steal staked Cardano tokens by manipulating reference scripts and burdening validators with excessive workloads. Despite the high transaction load, the attack failed to disrupt the network or move any stolen funds. Developers swiftly reclaimed the attempted theft. Cardano CEO Philip Disarro mockingly noted the attacker inadvertently contributed to the ecosystem’s open-source efforts. Undoubtedly, Kohl’s move has also contributed to the Dogecoin open-source effort. The community is expecting a patch soon, just like Cardano developers did. The DeFi security in 2024 has been a major topic of discussion in the crypto community. Many claim security has been neglected while hackers are constantly evolving their tactics. Just this month, a GigaChad (GIGA) token investor, known as “Still in the Game,” fell victim to a sophisticated phishing attack that stole $6 million worth of tokens . The attacker used a fake Zoom link mimicking an official URL to steal wallet credentials. Once inside the wallet, the hacker liquidated 95.3 million GIGA tokens, converting them into Solana (SOL), Tether (USDT), and USD Coin (USDC) stablecoins.

37546535,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374483,1734013672,ETH Seems Primed to Take Down $4K After Recent Rebound: Ethereum Price Analysis,"Ethereum has been oscillating within the critical $3.5K–$4K range, with its price recently finding support near the lower boundary at $3.5K. Following this rebound, the bulls are attempting a renewed push toward the $4K resistance level. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart The upward momentum in Ethereum’s price met a pause at the $4K resistance, which has proven to be a key selling zone. This rejection led to a decline toward the lower boundary of the range at $3.5K. However, renewed buying activity at this support has triggered another strong push upward, targeting the $4K threshold. The $4K resistance is pivotal, as it aligns with Ethereum’s prior swing highs and has repeatedly snubbed bullish attempts. Consequently, the short-term outlook suggests continued consolidation within the $3.5K–$4K range. A decisive breakout above the $4K level could pave the way for a broader bullish rally. The 4-Hour Chart In the 4-hour timeframe, ETH faced a sharp rejection at the $4K resistance, resulting in an impulsive decline below the middle boundary of the ascending channel at $3.8K. This move reflects the strong presence of sellers at the $4K level, making it a formidable barrier for buyers. Despite this setback, Ethereum found support near the $3.5K level, where buying pressure intensified. The subsequent bullish momentum pushed the price back above the channel’s middle boundary, bringing it close to the $4K resistance once again. While buyers remain eager to breach the $4K threshold, bearish divergence on the RSI indicator signals caution. A short-term consolidation below this resistance appears likely before another potential bullish breakout. Onchain Analysis By Shayan Ethereum’s price behavior, particularly its stability at the $3.5K support level, reflects the significant liquidity concentrated below this threshold, as highlighted by the Binance liquidation heatmap. Similarly, the $4K resistance level marks another critical zone of liquidity, primarily associated with short positions placed in anticipation of a price rejection. These two levels represent the highest concentration of liquidity near the current price. If ETH successfully breaches the $4K resistance, it could trigger a short-liquidation cascade as short-sellers rush to cover their positions. This would likely result in an impulsive price surge as the unwinding of these positions fuels further upward momentum. However, a breakout in either direction has the potential to ignite a liquidation cascade, intensifying the subsequent price movement. Given the prevailing market dynamics, a bullish breakout above $4K appears to be the more probable scenario.

37546773,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626512,1734013623,Trump’s crypto venture WLFI is not as shady as it looks. Or is it?,"President Donald Trump’s crypto company, World Liberty Financial Inc. (WLFI), launched just two months before the election, and it has been a source of controversy from the get-go. Partnering with Steve Witkoff, a billionaire real estate developer now turned Middle East envoy, the venture is grabbing attention for all the wrong reasons. The duo’s collaboration with TRON—a blockchain company accused of enabling financial transactions for militant groups like Hamas and Hezbollah—has raised questions about ethics, conflicts of interest, and Trump’s financial stake. Critics think WLFI’s timing and partnerships scream opportunism. Ethics experts, government officials, and even some within the crypto industry are uneasy. TRON: Cheap, fast, and deeply controversial TRON might not be as famous as Bitcoin, but its name rings louder in certain circles—just not for good reasons. Known for low transaction fees and fast processing, TRON has gained a reputation as a go-to platform for crypto transfers linked to designated terror organizations. According to Israeli authorities, 186 TRON wallets have been frozen since July 2021 for ties to terror financing. Of these, 84 were linked to Hamas, 39 to Hezbollah, and 63 to other unnamed militant groups or money changers. In March this year, Israel seized another TRON wallet it claimed was tied to Hamas fundraising after the group’s deadly attack on Israel in 2023. Despite these allegations, TRON continues to attract users because it offers anonymity, low costs, and easy cash conversions—qualities that appeal equally to lawful users and criminals. Justin Sun, TRON’s founder, brushed off accusations, claiming the platform actively collaborates with law enforcement and froze $70 million in illicit funds. Still, the U.S. Treasury is unconvinced. It sanctioned a Lebanon-based money changer this year for allegedly using a TRON wallet to send funds from Iran to Hezbollah. These sanctions further tarnish TRON’s reputation, yet the platform seems undeterred. Justin himself is no stranger to legal trouble. The SEC has charged him with fraud, accusing him of inflating trade volumes and hiding celebrity endorsements for his projects. Despite denying the charges, the case remains open. Trump’s financial stake raises red flags WLFI’s structure is as complex as its controversies. Trump is listed as the company’s “chief crypto advocate,” entitling him to 75% of specific revenue streams alongside other unnamed affiliates. WLFI also sells proprietary tokens that cannot be traded on secondary markets like Bitcoin. Critics say this setup could encourage buyers to use WLFI tokens to gain favor with Trump. Ethics experts also point to Steve Witkoff’s dual roles as WLFI’s co-founder and Trump’s Middle East envoy. Even if Witkoff sets up a blind trust, as he claims he plans to do, the financial stake he retains in WLFI makes his government role a potential conflict of interest. The concern is completely justifiable. If foreign governments or sovereign wealth funds were to invest in WLFI, Trump and Witkoff could find themselves in violation of the U.S. Constitution’s emoluments clause, which bars federal officials from accepting gifts or financial benefits from foreign entities without congressional approval. The lines between WLFI’s business and Trump’s political ambitions are already blurred, leaving plenty of room for legal and ethical questions.

ADA Heads North The cryptocurrency market experienced a notable recovery in the past 24 hours, with multiple leading digital assets charting impressive gains. Bitcoin (BTC), for instance, jumped above $100,000 again, while Ethereum (ETH) is inching toward the $4K level. Cardano’s ADA is also one of the best performers, with its price pumping by almost 15% on a daily scale . At one point, the valuation reached $1.17 before stabilizing at its current $1.14 (per CoinGecko’s data). Meanwhile, ADA’s market capitalization surged above $40 billion, solidifying the asset’s presence among the top 10 biggest cryptocurrencies. ADA Price, Source: CoinGecko Its most recent resurgence aligns with three bullish indicators. The first one is “Net Network Growth,” which, according to IntoTheBlock, has risen by 0.26% daily. The platform explains that the metric is a momentum signal “that gives a pulse of the true growth of the token’s underlying network.” Next on the list is “Concentration” (an indicator that measures daily changes in the positions of whales holding over 1% of the circulating supply and investors owning between 0.1% and 1%). The metric has climbed by 0.26%, entering the bullish zone. Last but not least, we will discuss “Large Transactions” (a technical tool showing the number of transactions greater than $100,000). The figure has risen by 0.52%, suggesting increased network activity . We recently released a video with some of the major developments surrounding Cardano. Check it out here: ADA Investors in the Green Contrary to the aforementioned bullish elements, one is in bearish territory. This is the “InTheMoney” indicator, which displays the change in the number of ADA investors currently sitting on paper profits. As of writing these lines, 73% of all people exposed to the asset are in the green , 16% are underwater, and 11% are break-even. Despite the slight retreat, the percentage of profitable investors remains much higher than what was observed at the start of August this year. Back then, almost nobody holding ADA was sitting on paper profits due to the token’s crash below $0.30. At that point, a whopping 87.6% were in the red, while approximately 12% were break-even.

Seeing the ease of use of crypto, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky approved a bill legalizing crypto assets in March 2022 to support his country against the Russian invasion. It was stated that the law in question would allow Ukraine to launch a legal market for crypto assets and continue to work on the national cryptocurrency framework. ” ] Now, the long-awaited news about BTC and cryptocurrencies has come from Ukraine. Ukraine plans to officially legalize cryptocurrencies in the first quarter of 2025, local news agency Pravda reported. Speaking to Pravda, Danylo Hetmantsev, Chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament's Finance, Tax and Customs Policy Committee, said that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are expected to be legalized in Ukraine in the first quarter of 2025, but there will be no tax exemption. “If we are talking about cryptocurrencies, the parliamentary working group is finalizing a bill. I believe that the draft law, developed in cooperation with the National Bank and the IMF, will be ready after the New Year. We aim to pass this law and legalize cryptocurrencies such as BTC in the first quarter of 2025. In our consultations with European experts and the IMF, we take a very cautious approach to using cryptocurrencies for tax exemptions, as this could facilitate tax evasion in traditional markets. So taxation will follow the model used for securities, with profits being taxed when assets are converted into currency.” *This is not investment advice.

In Australia, regulators proposed stricter AML/CTF rules to better the oversight of crypto activities, and also fined Kraken's Australian operator $5.1 million for regulatory breaches. Meanwhile, a California court ordered over $5 million in penalties against the people involved in the IcomTech Ponzi scheme. The scheme defrauded investors by misappropriating funds under the guise of crypto mining and trading. Dogecoin Faces Security Crisis A serious vulnerability in the Dogecoin (DOGE) network was exploited, which caused 69% of its nodes to crash. Andreas Kohl , co-founder of the Bitcoin sidechain Sequentia, claimed responsibility for the exploit, and stated that he used an old laptop in El Salvador to execute the attack. Before the incident, data from Blockchair revealed that Dogecoin had 647 active nodes. After the exploit, the number of active nodes dropped to 315. Kohl attributed the attack to a vulnerability identified by researcher Tobias Ruck. The exploit, nicknamed “ DogeReaper ,” was revealed by the “ Department Of DOGE Efficiency ,” which is an account on X, on Dec. 4. The account described the vulnerability as a powerful tool capable of crashing any Dogecoin node remotely. They compared it to the fictional “Death Note” from Japanese manga, where writing a name in the notebook causes a person to die of a heart attack. Similarly, the DogeReaper exploit allowed an attacker to target a node’s address, causing it to crash due to a segmentation fault. Segmentation faults happen when a program attempts to access unauthorized memory, which prompts the operating system to terminate the program for safety reasons. With Dogecoin nodes being publicly identifiable, the exploit poses a huge threat to the network. The account warned that a malicious actor could have potentially halted the entire Dogecoin network for days, which would have suspended transactions and block production. Despite the potential severity of the vulnerability, Coinbase deemed its impact low and awarded Ruck a $200 bounty for reporting the issue. Australia Proposes Stricter Crypto Oversight Australia is not taking any chances when it comes to protecting its people against crypto crimes. In fact, Australia proposed stricter Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (AML/CTF) rules to boost oversight of the cryptocurrency industry and combat financial crime. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Center (AUSTRAC) introduced the draft rules after recent amendments to the AML/CTF Act passed by parliament in November. These changes were made to close regulatory gaps, increase oversight of high-risk sectors, improve customer due diligence (CDD) measures, and enforce stricter reporting and compliance requirements for businesses. The proposed reforms expand regulatory oversight to sectors deemed high-risk, like cryptocurrency exchanges, legal services, and real estate businesses. Businesses will be required to implement stricter CDD processes, monitor suspicious transactions, and ensure transparency in cross-border asset transfers. Additionally, the framework mandates adherence to the Travel Rule for international transactions, requiring detailed information on the origin and destination of transfers. Another goal of the proposal is to reduce compliance burdens by introducing an outcomes-based compliance model. This approach allows businesses to tailor compliance efforts to their size, structure, and risk profile while maintaining stringent standards. The draft framework retains necessary exemptions from the previous regime through the AML/CTF General Rule 2025 and the AML/CTF (Exemptions) Rule 2007, while eliminating outdated requirements. AUSTRAC invited stakeholders, including financial institutions, legal practitioners, and crypto exchanges, to provide feedback on the draft rules during the consultation period, which will be open from Dec. 11 to Feb. 14, 2025. Australia is taking the safety of consumers very seriously. On Dec. 6, AUSTRAC launched a task force to ensure compliance among crypto ATM providers. This is a major step toward reducing the criminal misuse of cryptocurrency in the country. Kraken Australia Fined for Regulatory Breaches Australia’s Federal Court even recently imposed an 8 million Australian dollar ($5.1 million) fine on Bit Trade, the Australian operator of the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange. This was done after a legal victory by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ( ASIC ). Justice John Nicholas delivered the judgment on Dec. 12, and ordered Bit Trade to pay the fine within 60 days and cover court costs. The penalty stems from Bit Trade’s failure to meet design and distribution obligations and its operation as a credit facility without a proper license. The fine far exceeded Bit Trade’s proposed $2.5 million, which the court deemed inadequate. A Kraken spokesperson shared his disappointment with the ruling, and believes there is a need for clearer crypto-specific legislation in Australia to address regulatory uncertainties affecting investors and businesses. Kraken suggested the ruling could slow down growth in the Australian economy. The case centered on Bit Trade’s offering of a “margin extension” product, which allowed users to trade crypto or fiat with leverage without the required target market determination (TMD). ASIC Chair Joe Longo criticized the absence of a TMD, and believes it is very important when it comes to ensuring financial products are not inappropriately marketed to consumers. Longo revealed that over 1,100 Australians used the product, incurring over $7 million in fees and interest while losing more than $5 million collectively. One investor alone lost nearly $4 million. Justice Nicholas described Bit Trade’s actions as serious violations driven by revenue maximization. He also stated that the margin extension was provided without regard to compliance with corporate laws until ASIC’s intervention. Even after becoming aware of the need for a TMD, Bit Trade still offered the product to retail clients without the necessary adjustments. ASIC called the decision a major milestone, and it was the regulator’s first penalty against a crypto entity for failing to have a TMD. Court Fines IcomTech Fraudsters A California court also recently ordered five people who were involved in the IcomTech Ponzi scheme to pay more than $5 million for fraud and misappropriation of funds. The default judgment found David Carmona, Juan Arellano Parra, Moses Valdez, and David Brend liable for violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations. Marco A. Ruiz Ochoa agreed to a consent order. The ruling stemmed from a May 2023 lawsuit by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The scheme defrauded 190 victims in the United States and abroad, and solicited over $1 million by falsely claiming to invest in Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies through a fake mining and trading platform. Instead, the perpetrators misappropriated approximately $8.4 million of the victims' funds by December of 2022. Each of the four people were ordered to pay a $1 million civil monetary penalty, and along with Ochoa, approximately $1 million in restitution to victims, totaling over $5 million. All five individuals were permanently barred from registering with the CFTC or trading in CFTC-regulated markets. The mastermind, Carmona, was sentenced to 10 years in prison in October for conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Rodriguez , who was another key figure, was sentenced to eight years in late October, Brend received a 10-year sentence in December, and Ochoa was sentenced to five years in January. IcomTech operated between 2018 and 2019, and promised investors 100% returns every six weeks. The perpetrators also hosted very extravagant expos in the U.S. and internationally, arriving in luxury cars and wearing high-end clothing to project success and lure more unsuspecting investors.",NEGATIVE,DOGE,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6514/doge-reaper-vulnerability-brings-dogecoin-network-to-its-knees,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

In an X post on Wednesday, December 11, the analyst pointed out that USDT activity has risen alongside Bitcoin's price.The correlation comes as stablecoin activity often offers insight into market sentiment. For example, increased flows to exchanges can often signal growing market demand, and this has been the case in 2024. Per an IntoTheBlock chart shared by IT Tech, these flows have risen to almost $40 billion this year. At the same time, the number of active USDT addresses has risen alongside Bitcoin's price. Specifically, active USDT addresses rose sharply in 2024, from around 100,000 in January to nearly 350,000 in December. The same trend is observable with USDT's transaction count. This metric has risen nearly fivefold from just above 5 million to nearly 25 million as Bitcoin's price increased. Commenting on the data, IT Tech argued that it highlighted broader market participation and the increasingly important role of stablecoins in liquidity and trading.Interestingly, USDT's dominant role is also reflected in its market cap.

And now, observers are wondering if Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is next on his radar. Despite his past talent for bankrupting businesses, Trump’s crypto account seems to be bucking trends by performing rather well so far. According to Arkham , he currently holds almost $10M in crypto assets, with $TROG being the biggest one by far (almost $3.9M). This is notable as his preferred cryptocurrency has always seemed to be Ethereum ($ETH). But could his next target be Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE)? Given his political inclination to buck trends, break rules, and upset the apple cart, what $WEPE is trying to accomplish in the crypto markets may resonate with his team. After all, $WEPE is based on turning the tables on Wall Street whales, and letting the small investors make their potential fortune. This rule-bucking and trend-breaking could be what appeals to the President-elect, as he prepares to take office in just over a month from now. $WEPE is doing remarkably well at the moment with a market cap of almost $40M and a price steadily going up by the day. Presales have hit $3.5M with 5.2B tokens already bought and locked up. Future annual yields are currently estimated to be just over 150%. Social media buzz is also helping to propel $WEPE and boost presales, as it prepares to officially launch in just four days from now. All of this meme coin buying enthusiasm comes as Trump’s crypto platform, World Liberty Financial, embarks on a big crypto spending spree. Ethereum ($ETH) prices surged as WLF bought $10M of the tokens, as well as $1M in both aave ($AAVE) and Chainlink’s $LINK tokens. This is on top of another $30M spent in Ethereum ($ETH) in the past 12 days, and his close buddy Elon Musk using his X platform to push cryptocurrencies . Buying $LINK tokens is also worth noting, as Trump’s World Liberty Financial uses Chainlink’s infrastructure.

Notably, cryptocurrency trading expert Trader Tardigrade highlights that DOGE has successfully eased from its overbought levels, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart returning to the neutral 50 zone. This reset indicates the token has relieved its overbought pressure, paving the way for another potential leg upward. Historically, such RSI relief often precedes strong bullish movements, signaling a renewed momentum for the asset. DOGE price analysis chart. Source: Trader Tardigrade According to the expert, If DOGE sustains its current trajectory, it could target the critical $0.5 resistance level , a psychological barrier that, once breached, could open the door to further gains. “Since DOGE pullback has occurred and the RSI overbought condition has eased back to 50, another Uptrend could happen at any time”- he noted Meanwhile, the analyst previously indicated that DOGE’s bull run had “just begun,” citing signals from the Price Momentum Oscillator (PMO) indicator, as reported by Finbold For traders, this presents a potential opportunity to capitalize on Dogecoin’s next move, while investors eyeing long-term growth may view this as an attractive entry point. Key indicators point to increased network activity Further supporting this outlook, recent data from Santiment highlights a significant decline in Dogecoin’s Mean Dollar Invested Age, now at 370 days after dropping 31% over the past week, reflecting increased network activity among dormant wallets. DOGE Mean Dollar Invested Age. Source: Santiment This surge in network participation, particularly from large stakeholders like whales, has historically aligned with the early stages of bullish cycles for cryptocurrencies. Recent whale movements further reinforce the bullish narrative, with a transfer of over 61 million DOGE, worth $23.5 million, to Robinhood , followed by another transfer of 85.4 million DOGE, worth $32.9 million. Such large transactions can often increase the likelihood of heightened price volatility in the short term. Long-term projections hint at a significant upside Adding to this bullish perspective, crypto analyst Ali Martinez projects that Dogecoin is still in the ‘early stages of its bullish cycle.’ DOGE price analysis. Source: Ali Martinez/X Martinez projects that DOGE could reach $3 during the current bull run, with long-term projections pointing to a potential rise as high as $18.

This is typical consolidation behavior,” he told me. “From observations during the past two cycles, a rally in altcoins takes hold after a run-up in bitcoin. This sparks a rotation into altcoins as investors seek to outperform in the next phase of the bull market. In the prior two bitcoin-led cycles, the market cycle peak corresponded with bitcoin market cap dominance, which is currently in the mid-50s, falling closer to 40%,” Perfumo added, backing up what we’ve been discussing here on Empire . If we continue to see altcoins outperform, Perfumo thinks there’ll be a “pick-up in interest” “People are on the lookout for signs that crypto services are experiencing mainstream adoption. Stablecoins have already broken prior records in terms of circulating supply and DeFi total value locked (TVL) is inching closer to peak 2021 levels. We think the combination of significant improvements to scalability this past cycle and a line of sight towards a more favorable, pro-growth agenda for crypto innovation will lead to an environment that’s ripe for crypto services to catalyze a new wave of adoption.” But, as I wrote yesterday, it might be time to start prepping your bags for lower liquidity in the next few weeks, which is typical for this holiday period. Perfumo suggested that some of the selling might be put off till the new year as folks in the US specifically base their moves on the potential tax consequences. “It’s certainly possible that shortfalls in liquidity could lead to higher price volatility, both to the upside or to the downside,” he said. Speaking of next year, Perfumo’s in agreement with Canary Capital’s Steven McClurg that the cycle still has plenty of legs . It’s not just bitcoin posting wins, he noted that DEXs and some infrastructure plays — which have received plenty of support from venture capital — are ready to post wins on the year. However, some of the other sectors, like web3, gaming and the metaverse aren’t quite there yet. Or, if we’re being honest, are nowhere near being ready for mainstream attention outside of some exceptions (looking at you Off the Grid ). That’s not to say that there can’t be dark horses among projects yet to find mainstream attention, Perfumo said. Either way, he’s bullish on the environment, telling me that this is the perfect recipe for innovation within the space.

37545998,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=661703,1734012479,US-Russia Bitcoin Reserve Race Could Drive Altcoin Markets to Record Highs: Key Tokens to Watch,"A leaked proposal to Russian finance minister, Anton Siluanov on the creation of a bitcoin strategic reserve in Russia, is adding to speculation about an imminent Bitcoin Space Race between the two global superpowers. This, after President-elect Donald Trump pledged to establish his own Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the US , even suggesting part of the US debt “ could be “paid off” with Bitcoin. The leaked proposal hints Russia has its own reasons for getting into crypto: “In conditions of limited access to traditional international payment systems for countries under sanctions, cryptocurrencies are becoming virtually the only instrument for international trade.” The Central Bank of Russia is already preparing to launch an experiment in cross-border settlements in cryptocurrency. Putin himself recently described bitcoin as an “unstoppable technology” and praised its potential as an alternative to foreign currency reserves. Indeed, financial sanctions may have driven Russia to adopt bitcoin and crypto at a faster rate than in other countries. Meanwhile, the price of Bitcoin has soared in 2024, reaching the monumental $100,000 mark earlier this month. And as major global superpowers race to board the crypto train, the prognosis for 2025 looks bright. As we have seen, when BTC goes up, altcoins and meme coins surge as well. And, while Bitcoin is a safe bet for nation states, altcoins may hold the greatest life-changing odds for individuals willing to bet on the crypto craze continuing well into 2025. If that’s you, we’ve rounded up four of the best altcoins to get into right now. $XRP – Stable Option Geared for Cross-Border Payments XRP, the native cryptocurrency of the Ripple network, has seen huge growth in the past two months, gaining approximately 319.77%. Recently, it reached a six-year high of $2.46. XRP stands out for how it facilitates fast and low-cost international money transfers, with an average settlement time of just 4 seconds, and very low fees (0.00001 XRP per transaction). Recent regulatory gains, such as the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) approval for Ripple’s stablecoin, have also added to investor confidence. As have its recent partnerships with over 300 financial companies, including American Express, Bank of America, and Banco Santander. It’s easy to purchase XRP, you simply need a reputable wallet like the Best Wallet App . You can safely buy a range of cryptocurrency with Best Wallet, from popular meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe (PEPE), to new meme coins like Pepe Unchained. Crypto All-Stars – Multi-Token, Multi-Chain Meme Coin Vault You probably don’t want to miss out on Crypto All-Stars, the next big presale slated to break all the records. $STARS is also the first and only token that’s also a meme vault. That means it brings together many of the top meme coins, from Dogecoin to Pepe, under one roof, greatly simplifying the entire process for first time buyers who’d like to diversify across a number of meme coins. Also, buying and holding the native token, $STARS boosts your meme coin rewards even more. Crypto All-Stars is still in presale, and at today’s numbers, 1 $STARS = to $0.0016782, staking rewards are at a decent 191% and over $13M has already been raised. With just a week left to go before listing, this could very well be the presale to watch. Dogecoin – The First Doge in Space What began as little more than a joke back in 2013 has become one of the top meme coins in the world, thanks in no small part to endorsements by heavyweights like Elon Musk and Snoop Dogg. In recent news, Dogecoin shot up 60%, from approximately $0.1807 to $0.2897 – as fast as overnight on November 6, election morning – in anticipation of a crypto-friendly Trump administration. At the time of writing, (12 December 2024), DOGE shows no sign of slowing down, with analysts predicting it could reach $3 any time now. ETH – Second Only to Bitcoin Beaten only by bitcoin in terms of market capitalization, ETH is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum decentralized, open-source blockchain platform. Founded in 2015, today ETH accounts for as much as 20% of the $1.1 trillion global crypto market. Far more than just another crypto token, the Ethereum blockchain is really a global, decentralized platform running thousands of games, financial apps, and even many other crypto coins on its network. The best part is, just like bitcoin, ETH can often be used like fiat to buy and sell goods and services, fulfilling the original dream of crypto for financial freedom, not just quick riches. It’s Go Time for Crypto! Trump and Putin have both pushed the button on crypto and for the rest of us, well, it’s a good time to be alive. Who knew it was this easy to take away power from the banks? Who knew a meme could potentially change your life?! The race is on at every level, and as the world moves away from traditional payment methods to newer, crazier, decentralized alternatives, the winners will be those who seize the opportunity and can navigate the noise with patience and poise.

37546131,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626539,1734012435,AMP invests $27M in Bitcoin for the first time,"Australia’s largest super fund, AMP, has invested $27 million of its portfolio in Bitcoin, making it the first major fund to venture into the cryptocurrency market. AMP’s decision to enter into the digital asset sector comes despite the critical view from many quarters. One of the skeptics is Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) Governor Michele Bullock, who has expressed doubts about cryptocurrency’s place in the Australian economy. AMP is adopting Bitcoin to diversify its portfolio According to Shelley, AMP’s dynamic asset allocation process identified Bitcoin’s substantial market momentum and sentiment, which were the main drivers of the move to diversify. According to reports , the investment took place in May, when Bitcoin traded between $60,000 and $70,000. According to AMP chief investment officer Anna Shelley, just 0.05% of the company’s $57 billion in assets are allocated, which fits a larger diversification plan. Bitcoin’s latest rally to $100,000 per coin comes as the pivot, spurred by a market bull run following Donald Trump’s re-election and his new administration’s crypto-friendly attitude. Despite the risks, the fund had “taken the plunge,” said Steve Flegg, Senior Portfolio Manager at AMP, on LinkedIn. According to him, the cryptocurrency was simply too big to ignore in terms of growth and potential. Other super funds are all over the spectrum AustralianSuper said it was focused on blockchain technology and indirect investments in companies that use it while confirming no current plans to invest directly in cryptocurrencies. Australian Retirement Trust and retail super giant MLC have displayed some interest but with a considerable level of caution. Per the AFR report, they have no plans to follow in AMP’s footsteps. Shelley said the current allocation is at the upper limit for this asset class, but the fund will manage its holdings. Those with investments in AMP’s balanced and growth options will be the most exposed to Bitcoin at the customer level. Recently, ASIC (Australian Securities and Investments Commission) expanded its regulatory framework for cryptocurrency. It proposed to protect consumers while also encouraging responsible innovation in the crypto sector.

37545978,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/why-bitcoin-btc-is-probably-your-only-way-out,1734012383,Why Bitcoin ($BTC) is probably your only way out,"For the average Joe and Jane the current speed of currency debasement is going to have a major impact on their current and future wealth and savings, unless they do something about it. Could an investment into Bitcoin save them? The fiat experiment is coming to an end Much of the world’s population very likely still lives in complete blissful ignorance of the path countries’ economies are following. Debt is being piled on top of debt, and the only way out is for the respective central banks of these countries to print and print more currency in order to service these debts. The fiat currency experiment is coming to an end, and it has been a failure on the most colossal scale imaginable. The idea of all countries just following the lead of the U.S. Federal Reserve, and printing paper currency that has absolutely no backing behind it, with hardly any restraints, has led the entire world to the brink of bankruptcy. 15% per year is the minimum needed to stay above water If one adds yearly inflation to the rate of currency debasement, a figure of around 15% is probably the hurdle rate that the average Joe and Jane needs to make, over and above their salaries, in order to keep their purchasing power at the same level each year. Now, everyone knows that this is a feat beyond even most Wall Street investors, let alone the average Joe and Jane. Which assets would bring a yearly yield of at least 15%? There aren’t many. The sinking ship of government bonds Bonds have been a sinking ship for the last few years as institutional investors and other countries are demanding ever higher bond yields in order to even think about taking on such risks. Even if they are prepared to do so, most are only buying short term bonds out to a year or two, with a future beyond this extremely difficult to predict. Gold and silver outperform fiat but … The sound monies of gold and silver will very likely outperform all fiat currencies, but the banks have generally managed to suppress the price of both over several decades, with the help of the paper derivatives market. That said, both gold and silver are starting to rise, but as yet, neither are reaching that magic figure of 15% per year. Picking a stock market winner For the average investor there remains the stock market. If one is able to lay money on the right horse there is the possibility of far more than 15% per year. However, the big investors who consistently outperform the average stock market gains are few and far between. For those new to investing, picking a stock that is making these kinds of yearly gains is like picking a needle out of a haystack. The one asset that consistently outperforms So we come to the one asset that has the potential to save those who invest in it. This is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is currently up just over 500% year to date, and it is in the last stretch of its bull market, where it might be expected to add even more to these gains. In fact, Bitcoin has outperformed every other asset on the planet in most years since its birth in early January 2009. That said, there is one thing to remember. Until now, Bitcoin has had a series of 4-year cycles. In each cycle Bitcoin has generally gone up for roughly 3 years of a bull market, and then down for 1 year of a bear market. Even though the bull markets have brought extraordinary gains to holders, the bear markets have been quite grim. The last two bear markets of 2018 and 2022 registered a -73% and -64% dip respectively. It therefore needs to be said that investing into Bitcoin is a longer term commitment, of at least four or five years, and probably more. Think of Bitcoin as a place to put your savings, where over the long term, they are going to increase, instead of decrease, as fiat currency savings certainly do. The choice needs to be made now Bitcoin is the liferaft that can save you. Yes, there are probably certain companies in the stock market that can bring big returns that might surpass that 15% hurdle rate, but finding them, and knowing when to cycle out of them, is likely beyond the knowledge of most investors. Finally, it must be borne in mind that Bitcoin is a very volatile asset. Much more than most. Upward surges and downward dips of $10,000 and more in one day are quite possible. Also, any asset has the potential to fail. Even Bitcoin could fail one day for a variety of reasons. However, remaining with your fiat currency in the bank or savings account is most definitely not going to end well. If you have woken up to the perils that are descending upon you, you still have time to make the choice. The financial decisions you take now will very likely have huge consequences for your future.

37546827,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51982,1734012383,"Atoma Launches Private, Decentralized AI on Sui","Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, December 12th, 2024, Chainwire Demos fully private and decentralized AI chat app with performance on par with ChatGPT and Perplexity AI Sui , the Layer 1 blockchain that delivers unparalleled scalability and speed, and Atoma Network , a next generation decentralized AI engine, today announced that Atoma’s fully decentralized AI layer, first announced earlier this year, is live on Sui’s Mainnet. The team also offered reporters a first glimpse into the potential of decentralized AI with a decentralized AI Chat app (code named “Utopia”) built on Sui that enables users to have full ownership of their private data while still providing a user experience on par with centralized alternatives. With its integration currently live in its alpha version on Sui’s Mainnet, Atoma is actively expanding its decentralized ecosystem with new nodes and application builders. For these developers, building on Atoma is an easy transition because Atoma’s API endpoints are directly analogous to those provided by the OpenAI API, which many of them are already familiar with. Then, with Atoma, they can create personalized applications like chatbots connected to social media, finances, or health applications that still maintain individuals’ control over their data. One of the unique strengths of Atoma’s structure is that all of its AI processing occurs in secure areas within a processor — called Trusted Execution Environments, or TEEs. As a result, AI computations are isolated from the rest of the system and AI inputs and outputs are fully private and beyond access by AI companies. Unlike centralized AI applications like ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity, where the companies that created the technology can associate inputs with individual accounts, Atoma protects users with complete privacy and censorship resistance. At the same time, by leveraging one of the world’s fastest blockchains, Atoma can offer a user experience with speed and efficiency on par with the centralized versions. While the AI chat app Atoma created as an initial demonstration represents one application of its technology, Atoma’s infrastructure empowers developers to create private AI agents that perform a multitude of tasks while protecting individual user data. Because the private AI agents on Atoma can access and process personal information without exposing user data, they are ideal for applications that require personalization and confidentiality. For example, Atoma-powered decentralized AI can: In DeFi : Manage portfolios, balance assets, and mitigate risks automatically. Execute trading strategies in real-time on market conditions. Interact securely with smart contracts for yield farming, lending, and staking. In Social Media : Automate content moderation, curation, and community management. Deliver personalized recommendations for content, connections, and ads. Verify interactions and maintain user privacy. Private AI agents can also provide significant value across areas like personal assistants, shopping, gaming, and decentralized science (DeSci). Atoma leverages Sui-related technology platforms to provide its best-in-class service. Atoma relies on the Sui blockchain for settlement, managing payments, and validating transactions, building on Sui’s industry-leading sub-second transaction finality, support for high volumes, and predictable, low-cost transactions. Atoma also integrates Walrus, a decentralized storage solution built on Sui for fast, secure access to private data. This integration ensures that sensitive information is securely stored and easily accessible, supporting AI models in retrieving external data for context-rich insights. By automatically managing data retrieval during long interactions, Walrus enhances memory, contextual understanding, and workflow efficiency, enabling more accurate AI responses. “Decentralized AI requires a blockchain with high degrees of scalability, lightning fast transaction speeds, and low, predictable transaction costs and on these metrics, Sui and Walrus really shine,” ​​said Jorge Antonio, CTO and Co-founder at Atoma. “Sui and Walrus offer a combination of performance, cost effectiveness, reliability, and ease of integration that is unique in our industry and we are thrilled to build on the foundation they provide.” “AI technology is advancing at an unprecedented pace, transforming industries and reshaping how we interact with the world. As adoption accelerates, decentralized and scalable solutions will be critical to safeguarding user control over personal information,” said Jameel Khalfan, Head of Ecosystem Development at the Sui Foundation. “Atoma’s work, built on the highly scalable platforms of Sui and Walrus, ensures that users can leverage the transformative power of AI without compromising the security and privacy of their data.” Contact Sui Foundation media@sui.io The post Atoma Launches Private, Decentralized AI on Sui appeared first on Times Tabloid .",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | SUI,,0,0,TimesTabloid,https://timestabloid.com/atoma-launches-private-decentralized-ai-on-sui/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png

While great and occasionally useful things have emerged from these trenches, they’ve also birthed millions of tokens with blink-and-it’s-gone lifespans. Enter q/acc, the Polygon zKEVM protocol that’s proving its worth in supporting more sustainable token launches. Quadratic Accelerator (q/acc) has just debuted on Polygon zkEVM aiming to set a new standard in how tokens are brought to market – and the early signs are promising. Instead of feeding a frenzy that leads to quick P&Ds and hollow value, q/acc integrates innovative tokenomic principles to support long-term sustainability. Building a Better Bonding Curve Drawing on tools like Augmented Bonding Curves (ABC) and Quadratic Funding (QF), q/acc is designed to align the interests of early supporters, project founders, and wider ecosystem participants. The end result is a more transparent, community-centered model that stands in stark contrast to the zero-sum mentality often found on traditional launchpads – think Pump.fun and the slew of imitators it’s spawned. q/acc has the laudable but hard-to-achieve goal of aligning incentives between token-holders rather than encouraging purely speculative behavior. This is attempted through several key mechanisms. Identity verification tools such as Privado zkID and Passport XYZ limit how much any single participant can contribute, putting a damper on the influence of whales and ensuring fairer distribution. Lock-up schedules also reduce the likelihood that tokens will be quickly dumped onto the market. Is an Ethical Launchpad Possible? The timing for q/acc’s arrival could hardly be better. Trust in token launchpads platforms has been steadily eroding thanks to waves of low-quality projects and outright scams. In contrast, just eight projects out of more than 200 applicants were chosen for q/acc’s inaugural round, which commenced on December 6. One of these early projects, x23, has already captured attention with its proposal to leverage artificial intelligence for onchain governance. Backing from established entities like Giveth, Commons Stack, General Magic, and Inverter Network adds credibility to q/acc’s protocol. Polygon’s emerging AggLayer and zkEVM network. meanwhile, provide the technical framework for a frictionless user experience. This combination of technical innovation, thoughtful incentives, and community curation points toward a future where token economies can work for all parties. The simple, unadorned bonding curve formula so adored by memecoin launchpads isn’t going to disappear overnight, and it still has its place for quick and easy token launches. But for more serious projects looking to go the distance, there’s a lot to like about q/acc. In a sector too often characterized by fleeting hype cycles, q/acc offers a viable alternative: a pathway to sustainable token economies that serve everyone involved, from core teams to enthusiastic early adopters.

37547124,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319010,1734012306,XRP Explodes 20% After Ripple Gets Green Light for Stablecoin – $10 XRP Next?,"The news has created significant tailwinds for the XRP price, triggering an 18.46% rally in the 36 hours post-announcement. With these bolstered fundamentals, bullish end-of-year projections eyeing a new high seem well within reason. The jump has completely erased the downside caused by the early week $1.6 billion liquidation event that crippled most notable altcoins , leaving XRP with just a 0.1% loss. However, much of the initial hype has since died down as trading volume has slumped by 47.5% to $12.6 billion over the past 25 hours. The XRP price now appears to be finding footing for its next move. Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin Receives Final Approval Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin is set for its public debut following final approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), the state’s top crypto regulator. This just in…we have final approval from @NYDFS for $RLUSD ! Exchange and partner listings will be live soon – and reminder: when RLUSD is live, you’ll hear it from @Ripple first. — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 10, 2024 Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, said that Ripple’s introduction of $RLUSD could significantly enhance XRP’s utility and liquidity. “By increasing transaction volumes and demand for XRP, RLUSD may play a pivotal role in supporting price growth. Additionally, Ripple’s ongoing adoption for cross-border payments continues to bolster market sentiment,” he said. XRP Price Analysis: Can XRP hit $10? Lee also credited optimistic scenarios suggesting an XRP price peak above $10, however, he cautioned that these targets “hinge largely on adoption and a resolution to regulatory hurdles.” In the near term, XRP’s technical setup lends to target around its past all-time high. Beyond that, the XRP price will be in a discovery phase, with fundamentals and wider market moves likely being the main contributors to a new high pushing into 2025. Following a sharp upward move in late November, the XRP price appears to be consolidating within a descending channel, forming a flag, before its next move up. XRP / USDT 4H chart, bullish flag pattern. Source: Binance. This channel may be nearing its end, though, as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has found its footing in the neutral zone at 50 after a stint in oversold territory. The MACD line also holds its position above the signal line, confirming that the bulls are vying to determine the next move. Given a breakout occurs, the pattern sets a price target of $3.50 towards the year’s end, reclaiming XRP’s past all-time high in a 50% advance on current prices. However, the support provided by the 50SMA thus far will need to hold to rule out a potential retest of the pattern’s lower boundary. This Fleeting Opportunity Could Bring Bigger Gains While a new high for the XRP price is certainly appealing, emerging opportunities hold the potential for quicker and more substantial returns. After all, fortune favors the bold. As “meme coin supercycle” sentiment takes hold and coins like $Coolguy and $Pnut experience sudden rises to prominence, strategic investors are looking to newer low-cap meme coins with exponential growth potential . Among them, Crypto All-Stars ($STARS) stands out as a unique opportunity, pioneering the industry’s first meme coin staking platform.

Investors who passed thus far are already kicking themselves, especially as $STARS itself offers one of the best passive income opportunities right now with a substantial 190% APY.

The team also offered reporters a first glimpse into the potential of decentralized AI with a decentralized AI Chat app (code named “Utopia”) built on Sui that enables users to have full ownership of their private data while still providing a user experience on par with centralized alternatives. With its integration currently live in its alpha version on Sui’s Mainnet, Atoma is actively expanding its decentralized ecosystem with new nodes and application builders. For these developers, building on Atoma is an easy transition because Atoma’s API endpoints are directly analogous to those provided by the OpenAI API, which many of them are already familiar with. Then, with Atoma, they can create personalized applications like chatbots connected to social media, finances, or health applications that still maintain individuals’ control over their data. One of the unique strengths of Atoma’s structure is that all of its AI processing occurs in secure areas within a processor — called Trusted Execution Environments, or TEEs. As a result, AI computations are isolated from the rest of the system and AI inputs and outputs are fully private and beyond access by AI companies. Unlike centralized AI applications like ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity, where the companies that created the technology can associate inputs with individual accounts, Atoma protects users with complete privacy and censorship resistance. At the same time, by leveraging one of the world’s fastest blockchains, Atoma can offer a user experience with speed and efficiency on par with the centralized versions. While the AI chat app Atoma created as an initial demonstration represents one application of its technology, Atoma’s infrastructure empowers developers to create private AI agents that perform a multitude of tasks while protecting individual user data. Because the private AI agents on Atoma can access and process personal information without exposing user data, they are ideal for applications that require personalization and confidentiality. For example, Atoma-powered decentralized AI can: In DeFi : Manage portfolios, balance assets, and mitigate risks automatically. Execute trading strategies in real-time on market conditions. Interact securely with smart contracts for yield farming, lending, and staking. In Social Media : Automate content moderation, curation, and community management. Deliver personalized recommendations for content, connections, and ads. Verify interactions and maintain user privacy. Private AI agents can also provide significant value across areas like personal assistants, shopping, gaming, and decentralized science (DeSci). Atoma leverages Sui-related technology platforms to provide its best-in-class service. Atoma relies on the Sui blockchain for settlement, managing payments, and validating transactions, building on Sui’s industry-leading sub-second transaction finality, support for high volumes, and predictable, low-cost transactions. Atoma also integrates Walrus, a decentralized storage solution built on Sui for fast, secure access to private data. This integration ensures that sensitive information is securely stored and easily accessible, supporting AI models in retrieving external data for context-rich insights. By automatically managing data retrieval during long interactions, Walrus enhances memory, contextual understanding, and workflow efficiency, enabling more accurate AI responses. “Decentralized AI requires a blockchain with high degrees of scalability, lightning fast transaction speeds, and low, predictable transaction costs and on these metrics, Sui and Walrus really shine,” ​​said Jorge Antonio, CTO and Co-founder at Atoma. “Sui and Walrus offer a combination of performance, cost effectiveness, reliability, and ease of integration that is unique in our industry and we are thrilled to build on the foundation they provide.” “AI technology is advancing at an unprecedented pace, transforming industries and reshaping how we interact with the world.

The first explored the electoral track record of Fairshake PAC's strategy.  While politicians battled each other across the 2024 U.S. electoral map, the crypto industry ran an unprecedented test of a 14-year-old Supreme Court decision that had dynamited a new tunnel into politics for corporate cash.  Thanks to a 2010 high-court case, a company can spend as much as it likes to bolster political allies and destroy enemies. It's constitutionally protected speech, and crypto businesses spoke loudly this year.  Seeing business interests influencing U.S. politics is nothing new, but there was something different about crypto's Fairshake political action committee and the $169 million it ultimately gathered. The organization chose not to bother with the niceties sometimes seen from mega-industries coating their policy agendas in pro-American, economy-boosting rhetoric. The Fairshake super PAC and its affiliated PACs didn't sugar-coat their aim: Getting as many crypto allies as possible on Capitol Hill, so they can write a crypto-friendly U.S. rulebook.  Three big crypto business names — Coinbase Inc. (COIN), Ripple Labs and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) — came together and moved enormous sums into the coffers of the campaign-finance operation. The PACs began to heap million after million into congressional districts across the country in 2024, overwhelming many contests during the primaries. The flow of money was transparent, even if the people and strategies deploying it were not.  And it was all possible because of the Supreme Court's 2010 decision commonly known as Citizens United, which along with a related cluster of cases has allowed corporations to purchase an unlimited amount of independent advertising for political campaigns. The PACs plowed $10 million into an effort to derail Representative Katie Porter's bid to be a senator in California, nudging the Democrat out during the primary there and avoiding the ascension of a politician they feared would join Senator Elizabeth Warren's crusade against crypto interests. The groups spent about $40 million in Ohio on the successful aim to oust Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, who stood in the industry's way as the chair of the Senate Banking Committee. But in many other places, it supported Democrat candidates, as long as they were also pro-crypto.  In the end, the industry backed seven winning senators and 46 members of next year's House of Representatives. That amounted to 91% of candidates the industry spent significant funds on.  ""We're quite proud of the political effort that we put in motion,"" said Faryar Shirzad, Coinbase's chief policy officer who was once a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive and a White House official. He told CoinDesk that the tens of millions in the U.S. who own crypto have been ""targeted, mercilessly, by unelected bureaucrats, and the fact that the community has stood up for itself is a hallmark of what democratic processes are supposed to be about.""  Implications for democracy  The performance from the Fairshake political action committee may now offer a model for how niche business interests can round up their own swath of Congress. For some, that's a bad sign for U.S. democracy.  ""The results probably look awesome to someone who only cares about the success of the crypto sector,"" said Rick Claypool, the research director at Public Citizen who has examined the sector's election spending, but he said it may come at the cost of the voters' larger interests getting shoved aside. ""Lawmakers will be thinking about the super PAC cash, sort of pointed at them like a loaded gun when it comes to crypto.""  ""It underlines the degree to which — as a result of Citizens United — this unlimited corporate spending poses a serious threat to democracy,"" he said.  The high court's controversial call on corporations in politics amplified what has long been a feature of how most U.S. politicians fund the expensive campaigns that win them office (or keep them there). Those who avoid corporate-tied money tend to be the rare exception. And in this category of campaign finance, the PACs aren't even allowed to coordinate with the candidates, giving politicians a distance. The candidates can say they have no control over outsiders spending millions on their behalf.   Citizen United was about the fairness of giving businesses an unhindered voice in the public discourse. Follow that road to its logical end, the critics say, and you potentially have a voice so booming that it drowns out others, which is why groups such as Claypool's Public Citizen have been shouting for a constitutional amendment to reverse the court's ruling.  Even the most jaded campaign-finance experts will often argue that it's impossible to accurately assess how dollars translate to votes. But if one is wondering whether money can steer a race, consider this fierce House primary in Arizona. In the 3rd Congressional District there, where the winner would almost certainly go on to win the general election in a Democrat-dominated region, two Democrats battled it out.   On one side was Raquel Terán, a progressive former state senator and chair of the Arizona Democratic Party who was supported by Elizabeth Warren. On the other was Yassamin Ansari, a former vice mayor in Phoenix who began touting crypto issues during her campaign. Terán took in about $1.4 million in direct donations against Ansari's $2.8 million, but the race remained closely matched.  Terán also netted about $1.9 million in outside support, which could have outmatched Ansari. But Ansari had friends in crypto, who provided $1.4 million in crypto cash to bring her outside ad spending to about $2.1 million. Even after that, the primary results gave Ansari only a 42-vote victory.  Almost all of that crypto cash came from the trio of companies that amassed a fortune, the kind of money that could have bought a village of 331 median U.S. homes or a fleet of 676 Lamborghini Huracáns. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and the two leaders of a16z, Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, chose to go all-in on the elections this year as the final answer to what so far hadn't been working in Washington.  ""I think we had a unique strength that made us successful,"" Coinbase's Shirzad said. ""We were on the right side of the arguments.""  He contended that the digital assets sector's success was rooted in an argument that resonated with Americans.  ""They understood, at a moment when Washington is struggling with how to bring semiconductors and 5G technology back to the United States, how insane it would be to allow digital asset technology to go to China and not come back,"" he said.  However, the super PACs his company backed weren't making that case in the actual races they jumped into. With no pretense, Fairshake spent whatever it took to find the most politically expedient path toward friendly U.S. crypto policy. The PACs didn't bother trying to bring people around to support crypto. The PACS instead bought ads to make whatever argument was most likely to help candidates win, without mention of digital assets. Their ads touted candidates' Democratic ideals in some districts and stood up for Republican beliefs in others.  ""The industry certainly seems to have topped the charts this cycle, and I think in some ways, if there's a precedent set, it's the sort of nakedly transactional dynamic of it,"" said Mark Hays, a senior policy analyst at Americans for Financial Reform, who has also worked on campaign finance issues. He wonders, too, about the philosophical questions the PACs may pose for crypto's believers.  ""You're invested in an industry movement that claims it's all about democratizing finance and making things fair and better for people, but the industry has basically perfected the same old pay-to-play politics,"" he said. ""Is it okay as long as you know your wallet is getting bigger?""  Once Fairshake located its crypto-fan candidates, it spent campaign-shattering levels of money that their opponents' organic fundraising couldn't compete with. If the opponent raised half a million in $20 donations from local constituents, Fairshake opened the fire hose to drown that candidate in a million dollars worth of ads.  Even in a district like Republican Riley Moore's in West Virginia, where his $1.4 million campaign coffers easily outpaced his nearest GOP rival, Fairshake dropped in to make sure he'd come away with it, devoting an additional $726,000 to his primary win. Last month, he beat his Democratic opponent with 71% of the vote and is among the crypto-supporting newcomers to Congress next year.  ""The public and elected officials and industry groups have full transparency in terms of what this industry is doing and investing in,"" said Josh Vlasto, Fairshake's spokesman, in an interview. The transparency, however, hasn't extended to discussions about how the companies set up the political shop and how they've directed it.  One of the most telling statistics, Vlasto said, was that in cases in which Fairshake's candidates were criticized by their political opponents for taking crypto money, the opponents all lost. ""It was something that the public was not only comfortable with, but they continued to support the chosen candidates,"" he said.  Money in politics  Still, this is about a large amount of money deployed by corporations to steer U.S. public policy. Consumer advocates like Hays believe a less demanding government oversight will mean bad industry behavior is likely to harm the same voters who put crypto candidates in office.   ""Money in politics is corrosive,"" he argued. ""Politicians are less accountable to ordinary voters and more accountable to a wealthy set of donors.""  Health insurers, pharmaceutical giants, energy companies and Wall Street — to name a few sectors — have had a heavy hand in elections for generations. But even after Citizens United, they didn't sprint into hyperdrive.  The crypto industry, compared with theirs, is a tiny sliver. While U.S. health insurers pulled in almost $25 billion in profit in 2023, digital assets businesses are quite a bit smaller. Coinbase earned $95 million in profit for 2023, for instance, and it still chose to devote some $74 million to the PAC.  Is there a lesson that smaller industries that commit to big political payouts can secure a significant number of friends in Congress? Is $139 million — the amount the PACs actually spent in this cycle — the going rate to buy congressional momentum?  Faryar and Vlasto said no, because it was about more than just money. ""We were very effective, because we had the resources to execute a strategy that aligned with where the voters were,"" Vlasto said.  But others see Fairshake's success in these congressional elections providing a blueprint for others, a scenario in which we could see artificial-intelligence businesses or electric-car makers or timber harvesters scrape together $200 million to secure a policy.   ""They have created a playbook that I think it would be foolish to think that other corporate sectors are going to not try to replicate,"" Claypool said.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/news-analysis/2024/12/11/did-crypto-cash-break-the-u-s-elections,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f2ac925a7a768a3a034001f0cf6c3ecdc6749b81-4000x2250.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

To some degree, this is because mining revenue has been down post-halving. However, with $100k BTC prices, HIVE is potentially all-in profitable in the current quarter. The company's share price is backed by it's BTC holdings to a significant degree, offering a compelling risk/reward setup on valuation alone. For the first time ever, I think HIVE is a buy. Back in April, I upgraded HIVE Digital Technologies ( HIVE ) from a 'sell' to a 'hold.' My history with HIVE through Seeking Alpha is not one of exuberance. In three prior articles covering the stock, I've called HIVE shares a 'sell' twice: Seeking Alpha While the company had been lagging the broader Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining industry based purely on share price performance in the public market, in April I felt the worst may have been over for a company that struggled to grow top line revenue following Ethereum's ( ETH-USD ) shift to proof-of-stake. Like numerous other public Bitcoin miners, HIVE has prioritized secondary revenue streams through high performance computing. For HIVE, this has theoretically been an easier transition compared to ASIC-only miners because of the GPU-based Ethereum mining equipment HIVE Digital already possessed. Revenue Breakout, Growth In HPC For the quarter ended September, HIVE Digital Technologies reported $22.6 million in total revenue. This was down slightly year over year from $22.8 million last year but down about 30% sequentially from the prior quarter: Three months ended Sept 30 2024 2023 YoY Revenue from digital currency mining $20,765 $22,514 -7.8% High performance computing hosting $1,883 253 644.3% Total Quarterly Revenue $22,648 $22,767 -0.5% Source: HIVE Digital Technologies , dollars in thousands Despite the dips in top line - which should be alleviated by higher BTC prices in the next reporting period - there is strong year over year growth in revenue from high performance computing. At $1.9 million in the quarter, revenue from HPC was over 8% of the company's total. This is far more than when I last covered the company and a sign that HIVE is indeed developing a secondary business segment. Still, the company lost money in the quarter: Data by YCharts For the three month period, HIVE produced another quarter of negative net income. At a $7.6 million loss in the quarter, there is some concern about liquidity based on cash levels at the end of the quarter - more on that in a moment. The good news is there are positive signs from the company's mining operation and strong BTC liquidity if the company should choose to tap into it's digital asset holdings to fund growth. Bitcoin Production While still the primary driver of top line revenue for the company, the long term trend in BTC from HIVE's Bitcoin mining operation has generally been down even as EH/s has been scaled higher. During the three months ended September, HIVE mined 340 BTC. Subsequent to quarter end, the company has been averaging about 110 BTC per month between October and November. Analyst's Chart, Company Filings Price increases in Bitcoin can help offset the diminishing block reward from mining. Thus, it's imperative that Bitcoin mining companies try to manage the most efficient operation possible. For HIVE Digital, efficiency scores are strong. In November, the company mined at a 19.4 BTC per EH/s figure. This was good for the third most efficient mining operation in the public equity space: November 2024 EH/s BTC BTC per EH/s Marathon Digital ( MARA ) 46.1 907 19.67 TeraWulf ( WULF ) 5.9 115 19.49 HIVE 5.3 103 19.43 IREN Limited ( IREN ) 19.7 379 19.24 Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) 25.8 495 19.19 Source: company filings HIVE Digital plans to continue to scale its self-mining hashrate to 12.5 EH/s and has a 100 MW expansion in Paraguay that the company projects for Q3-2025. HIVE has also been busy with fleet upgrades and recently announced purchases of new mining machines from Bitmain and Canaan ( CAN ). CoinShares In the past, I've provided readers with a back-of-the-envelope all-in cost to produce a single Bitcoin for most of the mining stocks I've covered. That estimate generally included COGS, SG&A, and Depreciation/Amortization. CoinShares has a really terrific methodology for building a similar all-in cost figure that includes taxes and interest expense. By their estimates, the all-in cost to mine a BTC for HIVE is a little above $80k per coin. Importantly, HIVE claims the fourth lowest all-in cost in the public equity markets and is one of the few miners that could actually be 'all-in' profitable at current BTC price levels. Balance Sheet & BTC Treasury Data by YCharts At the end of September, HIVE Digital's cash position was down to just $7.2 million. Given HIVE's loss in the last quarter, there isn't much runway left for quarterly losses. The company announced a $200 million ATM back in October . HIVE doesn't necessarily need to draw on that ATM immediately if it can continue to operate efficiently with $100k BTC prices. To be sure, higher prices bring on more competition for the block reward, so there is certainly no guarantee HIVE will profitable during the current operating period. That said, HIVE does have a top 5 BTC stack compared to all public miners. Analyst's Chart, Company Filings At 2,713 BTC with a $100k BTC market price, HIVE has roughly $271 million in BTC liquidity that it can put to use before exhausting its ATM. At a $522 million market capitalization, more than half of the company's value is backed by the BTC on the balance sheet. Given that, there is some justification for higher share prices purely based on the BTC Treasury. Sats Per Share December 2023 September 2024 YTD Change HUT 8 ( HUT ) 16,188 9,739 -39.84% MARA 6,250 8,804 40.87% RIOT 3,190 3,215 0.80% CleanSpark ( CLSK ) 1,617 2,971 83.70% HIVE 1,845 2,194 18.88% Source: Author's calculations based on September 2024 shares outstanding levels HIVE's 'sats per share' figure stands at just under 2,200 - which is good for fifth in the public mining space and puts HIVE among the leaders in year to date sats per share growth at 19%. Analyst's Chart, Company Filings That said, investors should be mindful of the long term trend in the 'sats per share' metric. Like most of these miners, HIVE's 'sat backing' per share has gone down over the last two years. This is very typical and certainly not unique to HIVE. The only public miner really bucking that trend at the moment is Marathon Digital and it's mainly due to the company piggybacking MicroStrategy's ( MSTR ) ' infinite money glitch ' scheme. Closing Thoughts I'm going to upgrade HIVE Digital again from 'hold' to 'buy.' I think the reward outweighs the risk in this stock at this point. HIVE is growing in the area that it needs to grow and has one of the most efficient fleets in the market. With Bitcoin prices now surpassing the company's all-in break-even cost as estimated by CoinShares, earnings from operations should allow the company to scale its operations without exhausting the ATM at current share prices. TrendSpider I think the stock also has a very interesting technical setup and it's similar to the one I've laid out in other articles for Seeking Alpha. We have both a back-test of a trend breakout and of the 50 day moving average. BTC prices are still poised to run from here in my personal view and that should further propel HIVE higher based on the company's 'sats per share' relative to peers. The market is putting a much larger premium on other miners in the market. Given that, I'm of the view that HIVE offers an interesting value setup in addition to the technical setup. I think it's a buy.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4743797-hive-digital-im-finally-a-buyer?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37545800.jpeg

Pepe Loves Santa (PEPESAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Loves Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Loves Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Loves Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Loves Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Loves Santa by entering its contract address – 9FuN9o4pQgF3NF1v2saWvb7b9hNKDJ1DGU6LSbur437Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/pepe-loves-santa-pepesan-solana-memecoin-to-explode-19000-before-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Chances of a rate cut continue to rise despite November’s high inflation report. The CPI (consumer price index) went up in November, rising to 2.7% from October’s 2.6%. Notably, the rise was in line with estimates from economists polled by LSEG. The rise in CPI moved the headline inflation figure further from the Fed’s targeted 2% rate. Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said the increase in inflation would not be enough to spoil Christmas. Inflation report won’t dim chances of December interest rate cut According to CME FedWatch tool a 25 bp rate cut is almost certain next week pic.twitter.com/bMrGwredGv — Tunc Satiroglu (@kanalfinans) December 12, 2024 According to the CME FedWatch tool, expectations that the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 bps during the next policymakers’ meeting rose from 94.7% to 98.6%, even as inflation edged slightly higher in November. Zaccarelli claimed that next week’s interest rate cut would enable markets to rally into the end of the year. He added that the Fed is likely to look through these recent month-to-month headline CPI fluctuations to continue on its easing path. The Fed began the ongoing rate-cutting cycle with a huge 50 bps cut in September, followed by another 25 bps cut in November. EY chief economist Gregory Daco and senior economist Lydia Boussour expected the Fed to continue cutting rates despite the latest inflation data. They thought it should be a closer call for the policymakers than the markets indicated. “We believe economic fundamentals of gently decelerating labor market momentum, strong productivity growth and disinflationary under-currents would support a further 25 bps fed funds rate cut at the upcoming FOMC meeting.” – Daco and Boussour Nearly 90% of the economists polled by Reuters expected the 25 bps reduction to bring the federal fund rate down to the 4.25%—4.50% range. However, there was no clear consensus among the polled economists about what the Fed would do beyond the January 2025 FOMC meeting. Fed chair says the pace of interest rate cuts depends on economic conditions Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, said that the U.S. central bank was gradually lowering interest rates and would adjust the pace of rate cuts as needed based on economic conditions. He explained that monetary policy would be adjusted to best promote the country’s price stability and maximum employment goals. According to Powell, the Fed would dial back policy restraint more slowly if the economy remained strong and inflation did not sustainably move towards 2%. He said the Fed would move quicker if the labor market weakened unexpectedly or inflation fell faster. The Fed chair pointed out that the economy was not signaling the need to lower interest rates quickly. He added that the country’s economic strength allowed the Fed to approach its decisions carefully. The policy rate path would ultimately depend on how the economic outlook and incoming data evolved. Powell said the smart move would be to navigate between moving too fast and too slow to ensure the Fed got it right. Going down the middle would help support the labor market and bring inflation down.

The platform also includes a presale aggregator, offering early access to vetted crypto projects during their presale phases, an appealing feature for investors looking to maximize returns. With that, it’s not a surprise why so many analysts predict that Best Wallet can be the next MetaMask. Bear in mind that the project is still in its developmental stages, with some features like the Best Card and certain advanced security functionalities still marked as ""coming soon."" However, the ecosystem's clear roadmap includes future updates to enhance user experience and expand its offerings. Overall, the Best Wallet Token ecosystem is ambitious, aiming to simplify crypto management while providing unique incentives like cashback, staking perks, reduced transaction fees, governance rights, and early presale access. The presale has so far raised over $3.5 million, and at the time of writing this, $BEST is priced at just $0.0231 per token.

Visit Catslap What Should You Check Before Investing in a Crypto Presale? Before committing funds to a crypto presale, investors need to perform due diligence to identify both potential opportunities and risks. Below are the key factors to evaluate: 1. The Project's Whitepaper and Roadmap One of the most important things to check before investing in any crypto presale is its project whitepaper and roadmap, as a detailed whitepaper explains the project's purpose, technology, and goals. Therefore, before investing, look for a clear roadmap outlining specific milestones. The more transparent the team is about their plans, the better positioned they are to deliver on their promises, so pay close attention to timelines and feasibility. 2. Team and Community Another thing you need to do before investing in any meme coin or cryptocurrency is to research the team behind the project. Are they experienced in blockchain development, marketing, or the industry they're targeting? Ensure the team is credible as a strong and credible team with a history of successful ventures inspires confidence. Additionally, assess the project's community on platforms like Discord, Twitter, and Telegram because an engaged and growing community often indicates strong interest and long-term support. 3. Partnerships and Funding When investing in a presale, always look for established partnerships with reputable companies or investors because these connections indicate industry confidence. Additionally, evaluate how the project plans to use presale funds and whether it has secured private funding to supplement its goals. 4. Security Audits and Smart Contracts Lastly, before investing in a crypto presale, it is wise and important to find out if the presale project is reputable and if it has smart contracts audited by a third party to ensure there are no vulnerabilities. So, reviewing audit results and avoiding projects with vague or incomplete technical details is a must before making any investment in a crypto presale. Pros and Cons of Investing in a Crypto Presale Here are the key advantages and disadvantages of investing in a crypto presale: Pros Potential for High Returns: Early investors in successful projects often enjoy substantial profits when tokens are listed on exchanges. Discounted Price: During presale, tokens are typically priced lower than their launch price, thereby maximizing potential ROI. Exclusive Perks: Some projects offer additional benefits like airdrops, bonus tokens, or early access to their platforms. Portfolio Diversification: Investing in presales provides exposure to innovative projects with unique use cases, diversifying an investor's crypto holdings. Community Involvement: Early investors often gain a voice in the project's direction, especially in decentralized governance models. Cons High Risk of Scams: The crypto space is notorious for fraudulent projects. Fake presales can lure investors with promises of high returns, only to disappear with their funds. Uncertain Market Performance: Even with strong fundamentals, many tokens struggle post-launch due to poor market conditions or lack of adoption. Illiquidity: Presale investments may lock funds for extended periods, leaving investors unable to sell until tokens are listed. Dependence on Team Execution: Success hinges on the project team's ability to deliver. So, any delays or failures can significantly impact token value. Lack of Regulation: The unregulated nature of crypto presales exposes investors to risks, including sudden policy changes in different jurisdictions. Conclusion - Are Crypto Presales Worth It? Crypto presales are a high-risk, high-reward opportunity, and while they can offer significant returns, especially in a bullish market, due diligence is important to mitigate risks. But, it’s also crucial to understand that crypto presales typically do not require a large capital investment. Most of these coins are offered at extremely low prices, making it sometimes a buy-and-forget investment that might produce high returns in the future. So, if you are looking for big gains by investing in a crypto presale, these six crypto presales listed above showcase a mix of innovation, utility, and community engagement, making them strong contenders for the next big breakout. And, as the market continues to evolve, early adopters who invest wisely in presales stand to benefit the most. If you’re ready to take calculated risks, now, with the rising optimism in the crypto market, it can be the perfect time to explore these opportunities.

37545043,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392405,1734010439,"Ukraine to Legalize Crypto in 2025, but Here’s the Catch","The post Ukraine to Legalize Crypto in 2025, but Here’s the Catch appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ukraine is set to legalize cryptocurrency by the first quarter of 2025, taking a significant step toward regulating its digital economy. However, the country has clarified that it will not offer tax exemptions for cryptocurrency transactions. Danylo Hetmantsev, head of Ukraine’s Parliamentary Committee on Finance, Tax, and Customs Policy, revealed that a parliamentary group is finalizing the first draft of a cryptocurrency law. Developed in collaboration with the National Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the draft is expected to be ready shortly after the New Year. Hetmantsev is confident that the legislation will be passed, making cryptocurrency legal in Ukraine by early 2025. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Regulations In Ukraine 2024: How is the Government Responding to Cryptocurrencies , Taxation Modeled on Securities Hetmantsev noted that there will be no tax exemptions for cryptocurrency. Taxation will follow the model used for securities, with profits taxed when assets are converted into currency. Hetmantsev explained that, after consulting with European experts and the IMF, they are taking a very cautious approach to using cryptocurrencies for tax exemptions, as this could potentially lead to tax evasion in traditional markets. Final Step to Legalization In November 2023, Ukraine’s parliament registered a draft law on the taxation of virtual asset transactions. Once this law is adopted, it will complete the process of legalizing cryptocurrencies in Ukraine, opening the door to a new regulated digital asset framework. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Dubbed “Praetorian,” this service aims to bolster national security by allowing states to manage their Bitcoin reserves through Casa’s advanced multisignature crypto vaults. Each vault in the Praetorian system operates in distinct jurisdictions, offering robust encryption to safeguard assets. This approach also enables administrative delegation, ensuring seamless transitions between personnel or government administrations. Highlighting the product’s resilience, Casa CEO Nick Neuman stated : “Today, a nation can and should take self-custody of its private keys. This gives full control over sovereign reserves while maintaining security and continuity through thoughtfully designed tools.” Casa stated that Praetorian ensures funds remain secure even in the unlikely event of the company ceasing operations, maintaining the integrity of sovereign Bitcoin holdings. Global Race for Bitcoin The introduction of Praetorian comes amid a growing global conversation about Bitcoin’s role as a strategic reserve asset. Prominent investor Anthony Pompliano recently declared on Yahoo Finance that a “global race” for Bitcoin is underway. He argued that the cryptocurrency’s scarcity—limited to just 21 million coins—would inevitably drive competition among nation-states to secure their share. This sentiment is echoed by U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis, who suggested the U.S. Treasury diversify some of its gold reserves into Bitcoin to hedge against economic uncertainty. Lummis proposed this shift as a balance sheet-neutral strategy, acquiring roughly 5% of Bitcoin’s total supply at current valuations. On the municipal front, Vancouver Mayor Ken Sim has advocated for Bitcoin as a treasury asset, citing its potential to hedge against inflation and safeguard the city’s purchasing power. China’s Strategic Move Looms Adding to the discourse, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao recently predicted that China would inevitably establish a Bitcoin reserve if the United States were to do so. Speaking at the Bitcoin Middle East and North Africa (MENA) 2024 conference, Zhao argued that geopolitical competition and strategic necessity would compel such a move. With governments increasingly recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against economic instability and inflation, solutions like Casa’s Praetorian position themselves as critical infrastructure for the next wave of financial sovereignty.

Following the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, the asset class has seen unprecedented institutional adoption.Amid this wave of institutional adoption has also come never-before-seen demand.According to CryptoQuant founder Ki Young Ju, $80 billion is flowing into the Bitcoin market every month.The prominent analyst shared this view in an X post on Thursday, December 12, noting that, in addition to this high capital influx, most of the total capital the asset has attracted has come this year. ""Nearly half of the capital that has entered the Bitcoin market over the past 15 years was added this year,"" he wrote, adding, ""If you don’t understand what this means, you still don’t understand Bitcoin."" The metric is significant in the context of Bitcoin's limited supply. Following the asset's April 2024 halving, about 13,500 Bitcoin is now mined per month, at current rates that is around $1.35 billion.With $80 billion flowing into the market within the same timeframe, this suggests that Bitcoin is seeing significantly higher demand than supply, which is supportive of its price.Indeed, even though Bitcoin's price is at record highs, above $100,000 at the time of writing, a chart shared by Young Ju suggests that the asset is trading at its realized cap, often indicative of market bottoms. The realized cap represents the value of each coin when it is last moved.With the new Bitcoin supply set to reduce every four years, the impact of this demand on price will likely only grow stronger if such demand is sustained.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/12/heres-how-much-bitcoin-is-attracting-every-month-and-what-it-means-for-price/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-how-much-bitcoin-is-attracting-every-month-and-what-it-means-for-price,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

On December 11, the motion dubbed “Preserving of the City’s Purchasing Power Through Diversification of Financial Reserves – Becoming A Bitcoin Friendly City” passed with strong support, securing six votes in favour, two against, and three councillors absent. The bill was initially proposed by pro-crypto Mayor Ken Sim on November 26, when he argued that integrating Bitcoin into the city’s financial strategies would help the city retain its purchasing power by acting as a hedge against inflation. Sim is a vocal advocate for cryptocurrencies and has demonstrated his support for the sector by accepting campaign donations in cryptocurrency as early as 2022. In the proposal, Sim touted Bitcoin’s proven track record as one of the best-performing assets of the past decade, noting that adopting it would benefit the city’s taxpayers. As part of the city’s plans to become “Bitcoin-friendly,” the proposal also suggests exploring the possibility of accepting Bitcoin for municipal taxes and fees. Why Bitcoin? During the December 11 City Council meeting, Sim reiterated his stance on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, noting that his proposal was in response to Vancouver’s growing affordability challenges and the potential for Bitcoin to address financial instability. According to him, the move secures “the next 100 years” for the city. Further, the Mayor noted that city housing prices had increased by 381% between 1995 and 2022, while the value of gold remained relatively flat. Sim also pointed out that Vancouver’s fixed-income securities, valued at $3.1 billion, had lost $185 million in market value, which highlights the city’s need for diversification. As such, he believes Bitcoin is the answer to Vancouver’s economic woes. Showcasing his commitment towards technology, Sim also pledged a $10,000 Bitcoin donation to the city ahead of the voting session. Among those opposing the motion, Councilor Pete Fry raised concerns over the non-legal tender status of cryptocurrencies, as well as the potential for money laundering and a lack of consultation with law enforcement on the issue. Meanwhile, Adriane Carr, another Councilor, pointed to the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining and the potential strain it could place on the city’s electricity grid. A wave of Bitcoin adoption Vancouver is one of many governments exploring Bitcoin integration as part of their financial strategies. El Salvador made history in 2021 as the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, while Bhutan has been mining the digital currency since 2019. In the US, several states are considering legislation to establish Bitcoin reserves , with Pennsylvania leading the way by proposing to allocate up to 10% of its funds into Bitcoin. More recently, Anton Tkachev, Duma state deputy of Russia, urged the nation’s finance minister to consider creating a Bitcoin reserve.

On the support side, levels at $0.00001582 and $0.000007486 could provide stability if the price dips. Looking ahead, the nearest resistance level is at $0.54. If DOGE breaks this barrier, it could target the second resistance at $0.64, representing a potential gain of up to 28% from the current price. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $0.35. Falling to the second support at $0.25 would mean a decrease of around 39%. Traders are watching these levels to gauge Dogecoin's next move. Dogecoin (DOGE) Over the past six months, Dogecoin's price has surged by 189.40%. In the past month alone, it increased by 47.25%. This strong upward trend reflects renewed interest in DOGE, with the current price ranging between $0.41 and $0.50. Technical indicators suggest continued momentum. The Relative Strength Index stands at 57.91, indicating bullish sentiment. The MACD level is positive at 0.0028, which often signals upward movement. However, the Stochastic oscillator is at 76.27, suggesting the asset may be approaching overbought levels. Looking ahead, the nearest resistance level is at $0.54.

37545154,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626428,1734010037,US banks hesitant despite Trump’s pro-crypto stance,"US bankers are reportedly adopting a cautious stance on crypto assets despite high expectations of pro-crypto rules under President-elect Donald Trump. Key crypto leaders may already be all-in for bullish reactions to regulation clarity but banks aren’t rushing in yet. Trump, who emerged as the “Crypto President,” has promised to end the Biden administration’s crackdown on the sector. His win in the US elections has already sent Bitcoin to the moon as the asset’s price hit $103,900 on December 5. Spot BTC ETFs have also recorded around $10 billion of inflow since Trump became president-elect. Goldman Sachs leads US banks in calls for clarity According to reports , US bankers are still hesitant about diving into the volatile asset market. Speaking at the Reuters NEXT conference in New York, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon made it clear that “the regulatory framework has to evolve.” He added that the Wall Street giant would “evaluate” dealing in top cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum if the rules change. BNY Mellon has started offering crypto custody services to ETFs . However, its CEO Robin Vince highlighted that any new ventures must be tested through macroeconomic cycles before scaling. He added that the market has seen a couple of cycles already in crypto. It will be crucial to see how these assets evolve. These executives’ comments suggest that the path forward is still unclear and that banks aren’t ready to take major steps just yet. David Sacks’ SEC role sparks crypto hope The digital assets market has witnessed stricter regulations under President Biden, which made it challenging for banks to hold crypto tokens. Trump’s entry into office has managed to deliver some hopes of a shift in policy that could boost adoption. The president-elect recently announced former PayPal executive David Sacks as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This move has raised expectations among investors but uncertainty remains as Trump still needs to appoint key banking regulators. The crypto market has seen much turbulence in the last 4 years. The collapse of the biggest crypto-friendly banks (Silvergate and Signature) in less than a week in 2023 ranks high on that list. However, the federal government decided to step up and provide a backstop for depositors of the banks when customers asked for accountability. Before this, the infamous cases of FTX and Terra Luna proved to be major shockers for the industry. Recently, FTX debtors recovered around $14.5 million in political donations which was tied to Sam Bankman-Fried’s leadership. The returns have come from the House Majority PAC ($6 million) and the Senate Majority PAC ($3 million). The funds will be reportedly used to compensate FTX creditors .

Ether spot ETFs posted a 13-day inflow streak on Wednesday to reach nearly $2 billion in cumulative net inflows. The funds attracted their first billion from July to early December, but SoSoValue data shows that they needed only five trading days to capture the next billion.    Total daily transactions hovered around the 6.5 million to 7.5 million level in the past few months, compared to about 5 million through 2023, indicative of higher network activity.    Meanwhile, the total supply of ETH has reached its highest level since April 2023, but the amount of ETH burned via fees has been growing since September. The total supply of ETH has reached 120 million, marking the highest level since April 2023.    Burns refers to permanently removing tokens from circulating supply by sending them to a wallet that no one controls. As the network sees higher activity and demand, the burn rate increases, limiting the growth of ETH supply and creating deflationary pressure.    Higher network activity on Ethereum signifies increased usage and demand for the network's capabilities, reflecting the growing adoption of decentralized applications. Moreover, it leads to greater ETH burned via transaction fees, which can create deflationary pressure on the total ETH supply, as the burn rate can outpace issuance during periods of high activity.    These factors cumulatively set up ETH to retake its all-time highs from 2021 and beyond.    “ETH could be heading above $5k if current demand and supply dynamics continue,” CryptoQuant said. “According to ETH’s realized price—the average price at which holders purchased their ETH—the current upper limit for ETH’s price stands around $5.2k.”    “This upper limit marked the top for ETH in the 2021 bull run. However, as new market participants buy ETH at higher prices, this upper price band continues to rise,” they added.    The recent surge in Ethereum's price has significantly increased the total value of assets locked within its ecosystem, reaching $77 billion on Thursday, the highest level since January 2022.    The lion's share of these assets is managed by just three key applications: Lido, which dominates with over $38 billion in staked ether, making it the largest liquid staking protocol; Aave, with $19 billion spread across various assets, functioning as a lending platform; and EigenLayer, a restaking platform, holding $18 billion.    The Ethereum network has witnessed a notable uptick in several key metrics in November. There's been an increase in revenue, transaction fees, new wallet creations, and on-chain volume, all indicating heightened activity when compared to the quieter months from May to September, as a CoinDesk analysis previously noted.    Ether largely underperformed bitcoin and other major tokens since 2022 but saw a return in bullish sentiment after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential elections in November, rekindling hopes for a DeFi bull run among investors.    Trump's campaign has signaled a potential softening of regulatory pressures on cryptocurrencies, which could ease operations for DeFi platforms within the country. This anticipation has been a catalyst for increased demand for ETH and has propelled the growth of major DeFi tokens since early November.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/12/ethereum-s-ether-headed-to-5-k-as-activity-institutional-demand-grows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6147ff7539b5f07d08cf52acfe49e3ca9e8f4eb1-1960x1556.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At the same time, innovative initiatives like the Kenya National Fire Brigades Association's adoption of a Bitcoin reserve demonstrate how the digital asset is being embraced beyond investment circles, finding practical applications in diverse sectors. Kenya’s Firefighter Union Embraces Bitcoin: A Historic Step Toward Financial Innovation in Africa The Kenya National Fire Brigades Association (KENFIBA) has announced the adoption of a Bitcoin reserve. This initiative makes KENFIBA the first labor union in Kenya—and potentially the first of its kind in Africa—to integrate Bitcoin into its financial framework. The announcement was made on Dec. 11 at the Africa Bitcoin Conference, a platform where innovative blockchain and cryptocurrency advancements take center stage. This development was funded through a ”get off zero” donation facilitated by Proof of Workforce, a nonprofit organization that assists unions and workers in adopting Bitcoin. Proof of Workforce, which champions financial resilience through cryptocurrency, stated in a social media post, ”KENFIBA, The Kenya National Fire Brigades Association, adds Bitcoin onto their balance sheet, becoming the first labor union in Kenya to hold Bitcoin! Potentially, the first labor union on the continent to hold Bitcoin.” The fund established through this initiative is expected to significantly bolster Kenya's firefighting capabilities. Kenya, with a population of 56 million, is served by a mere 1,400 firefighters, a stark contrast to cities like Toronto, which employs 3,200 firefighters for a population of 3 million. The severe disparity places the spotlight on the critical need for enhanced resources and support for emergency response teams in the country. According to Magdalena Gronowska, an adviser to Proof of Workforce, Bitcoin could be a transformative force for KENFIBA. Writing on X, Gronowska stated that the reserve would support the union’s emergency response efforts, boost membership, and improve recruitment strategies. By adding Bitcoin to their balance sheet, KENFIBA is not only embracing modern financial technology but also setting an example for other labor unions across the continent. Africa has increasingly become a hotbed for cryptocurrency and blockchain adoption, with countries like Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa spearheading the movement. The establishment of Bitcoin reserves by unions such as KENFIBA could catalyze broader adoption of decentralized finance as a tool for social and economic empowerment. However, KENFIBA’s claim to being the first union in Africa to adopt Bitcoin has sparked some debate. A user named James Otudor, identified as a news media expert, suggested that a university academic staff union in Nigeria already holds a Bitcoin reserve. The Bigger Picture: Bitcoin as a Catalyst This historic adoption by KENFIBA is part of a larger narrative of technological advancement in Africa. The continent has seen rapid strides in blockchain, cryptocurrency, and artificial intelligence, as several nations prioritize technological growth. Countries like Kenya and Nigeria have passed progressive policy measures, while others, such as Algeria, Egypt, and Rwanda, have established official AI programs. Proof of Workforce sees Bitcoin as a means to address significant structural challenges. By placing Bitcoin on their balance sheet, KENFIBA not only secures a financial asset but also gains access to a decentralized, transparent, and efficient system. This could pave the way for more unions and organizations in Africa to explore cryptocurrency as a viable solution for financial sustainability and growth. The adoption of cryptocurrency by KENFIBA aligns with global trends in digital finance. As traditional financial systems face increasing scrutiny, Bitcoin continues to gain traction as a decentralized and borderless currency. In regions like Africa, where financial infrastructure often struggles to meet the needs of its population, cryptocurrencies provide a promising alternative. For KENFIBA, the adoption of Bitcoin is not just about financial innovation—it’s about empowering their members and strengthening their capacity to respond to emergencies. As this initiative unfolds, it has the potential to inspire similar organizations across Africa and beyond, demonstrating the transformative power of blockchain technology. Bitcoin Reclaims $100,000: A Milestone for the Leading Cryptocurrency Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has once again crossed the $100,000 threshold, marking a significant moment in its storied journey. According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin is currently trading at $100,822.24, having reached an intraday high of $101,177. This resurgence has propelled its market cap to approach the $2 trillion mark as well. The cryptocurrency’s latest rally has been fueled by strong institutional buying throughout the year. Bitcoin's price momentum has reignited discussions about its role as a digital store of value and its potential to rival traditional assets like gold. The surge comes just a week after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made headlines by acknowledging Bitcoin's competition with gold, a sentiment that has resonated across the financial and crypto communities. MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor, a well-known Bitcoin advocate, echoed Powell’s remarks during a recent interview with Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy. Saylor went a step further, urging investors to divest from gold, saying, ”You should sell your gold. Gold is gonna get demonetized.” MicroStrategy, which has become synonymous with corporate Bitcoin adoption, now holds an astounding $42.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. The company’s average purchase price has surpassed $60,000, demonstrating its unwavering commitment to the cryptocurrency despite market volatility. Saylor has consistently emphasized a long-term approach to Bitcoin, rejecting the idea of selling the company's holdings. In his interview, he warned against the repercussions of such a move, stating, ”The community would go ballistic if we decided to sell Bitcoin. They would never trust us ever again.” Saylor’s Critique of Trading and Hedge Funds Saylor also used the platform to critique hedge funds and opaque trading strategies. He expressed a preference for transparent, understandable investments, saying, ”If you show me a hedge fund that makes a billion dollars in an opaque way, I don’t want to invest a dime in you.” Instead, he reaffirmed his commitment to Bitcoin as a straightforward and revolutionary asset. Saylor’s comments highlight the growing divide between traditional financial strategies and the emerging ethos of the cryptocurrency sector, which champions decentralization, transparency, and long-term value. Despite its impressive performance, Bitcoin remains far from surpassing gold’s market cap, a milestone that would solidify its position as the ultimate store of value. However, institutional adoption and endorsements from influential figures like Powell have significantly bolstered Bitcoin’s reputation. The narrative of Bitcoin as ”digital gold” continues to gain traction, with many investors viewing it as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Powell’s recent remarks have added weight to this perspective as well. By positioning Bitcoin as a direct competitor to gold, he has effectively validated its role in the broader financial system. Saylor, for his part, has been unequivocal in his support, predicting a shift away from gold in favor of Bitcoin. What’s Next for Bitcoin? The $100,000 milestone represents more than just a psychological barrier; it signals renewed confidence in Bitcoin’s potential to transform global finance. As its market cap edges closer to $2 trillion, questions about regulatory frameworks, scalability, and environmental impact remain. However, the ongoing support from institutions and influential figures suggests that Bitcoin’s upward trajectory is far from over. Bitcoin’s journey to reclaim $100,000 suggests the crypto market is maturing. With steady buying from institutions and increasing mainstream recognition, Bitcoin continues to cement its status as a revolutionary asset class. As the debate over its role alongside traditional assets like gold intensifies, one thing remains clear: Bitcoin is here to stay, and its influence is only set to grow.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6516/kenya-s-firefighter-union-adopts-bitcoin-reserve-in-historic-move,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Cardano (ADA) Cardano is a big name in the world of cryptocurrencies. It's a flexible and scalable platform designed for smart contracts. This means developers can build apps, tokens, and games on its blockchain. The native coin of Cardano is ADA. Like Ethereum's ETH, ADA lets users store value, make payments, and support the network. What sets Cardano apart is its focus on being environmentally friendly. It uses a system called Ouroboros, which saves energy compared to other methods that use lots of power. Right now, the crypto market is paying attention to green technologies. Cardano's eco-friendly approach gives it an edge over other coins. Its innovative design allows for fast transactions, possibly up to a million per second. This is much quicker than many other blockchains. With the growing interest in decentralized finance and smart contracts, ADA could become even more important. While the market keeps changing, Cardano's strong technology and focus on sustainability make it a cryptocurrency to watch. Toncoin (TON) Toncoin is the digital currency of The Open Network (TON), an open-source blockchain aiming for fast, secure payments with low fees. Initially developed by Telegram as the 'Gram' token for the Telegram Open Network, the project was halted in 2020 due to legal issues with the SEC. Since then, the non-profit TON Foundation and community enthusiasts have taken over, renaming it Toncoin. The network uses proof-of-stake, enhancing its scalability and reliability. TON plans to build a full ecosystem with decentralized storage, services, domain names, private networking, and efficient payment systems. Looking ahead, Toncoin shows promising potential. Based on past price trends and Bitcoin halving cycles, some predictions estimate Toncoin could reach up to $30.30 by 2025, a significant increase from today's price. By 2030, it might go as high as $26.04. In the current market, where fast and secure payment solutions are in demand, Toncoin's technology could make it stand out. Its focus on a comprehensive ecosystem and minimal fees might attract more users. Compared to other coins, Toncoin's revival from a halted project to a growing community-led network is unique. As the crypto market evolves, Toncoin could be an interesting option to watch. Conclusion While ADA and TON are promising, XYZVerse's unique sports memecoin aims for 20,000% growth, making it a standout choice in the 2024 bull run.

37550194,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=104905,1734009853,Here’s Dogecoin Price If DOGE Market Cap Hits $137B and $472B,"Dogecoin's price could skyrocket if it claims the XRP market cap of $137 billion or Ethereum's valuation of $472 billion. Dogecoin, which has continued to collapse since the start of the new week, has its eyes set on more growth, according to analyses from multiple market commentators. These price targets are capable of catalyzing a surge in its market cap.DOGE Market Cap Hits ResistanceThe meme coin's market cap previously took center stage early in November, when it surged to a peak of $64 billion amid the price uptrend that saw DOGE break $0.40 on Nov. 12. With this market cap, Dogecoin overtook XRP and USDC to secure the sixth spot among the largest crypto assets.However, as DOGE faced resistance and XRP skyrocketed, the meme coin has now dropped to the seventh position, boasting a market cap of $60 billion at the time of reporting. For context, XRP's market cap has surged to $137 billion.This valuation makes XRP the fourth-largest crypto asset, only behind Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Tether (USDT). Interestingly, XRP proponents are currently aiming to flip Ethereum, which currently has a market cap of $472 billion.However, despite being largely below this region, some believe Dogecoin has the potential to challenge for a top three spot. Nonetheless, this would demand a massive spike in its price action.Dogecoin Price if It Gets XRP or ETH Market Cap For Dogecoin to reach XRP's market cap of $137 billion, its price must rise to $0.93, assuming the circulating supply of 147 billion tokens remains fairly stable. Also, to hit Ethereum's valuation of $472 billion, the Dogecoin price would need to reach a high of $3.2, surpassing the $1 mark by more than three times. Interestingly, several analysts believe these prices are feasible for the original meme coin. Last month, Trader Tardigrade argued that Dogecoin's second bull flag could push it to the $0.93 region. Also, market analyst Scofield asserted that it was only a matter of time before DOGE claimed $3.Meanwhile, despite being bullish on Dogecoin's price prospects, crypto exchange Changelly analysts do not expect DOGE to reach $0.9 anytime soon. They believe Dogecoin could only clinch $0.93 in October 2024, predicting further growth to $3.2 by March 2033. Dogecoin Price Prediction Changelly Dogecoin Price Prediction Changelly For context, the price of Dogecoin has largely consolidated since Nov. 12, when the previous uptrend hit a massive roadblock. Following this resistance, DOGE gradually began to claim a new two-year peak of $0.4843 on Dec. 8 despite the mounting bearish pressure.However, the gradual upward trend came to a halt this week as DOGE collapsed 11.22% on Monday on the back of a Bitcoin crash.

37544647,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392385,1734009736,Ripple vs SEC: XRP Rulings Challenged in Fresh Appeal – Trouble Ahead?,"The post Ripple vs SEC: XRP Rulings Challenged in Fresh Appeal – Trouble Ahead? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken a new turn. This week, a lead plaintiff filed an appeal against recent court rulings that favored Ripple, adding more complexity to the already intense case. Let’s break down the latest developments. Challenging Ripple’s Legal Wins Lead plaintiff Bradley Sostack isn’t ready to give up. On November 15, 2024, Sostack’s legal team filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. This appeal challenges several key rulings made by a California court. Source : Courtlistener The issues under appeal include summary judgments, class action certifications, and earlier dismissals. Notably, the appeal revisits Ripple’s legal wins that cleared its executives and affiliates. Central to the case is whether XRP, Ripple’s cryptocurrency, should be classified as a security under U.S. law. This lawsuit isn’t just about Ripple anymore. It has become a crucial test of how U.S. courts interpret digital assets under securities laws. If the appeal succeeds, it could reshape not only Ripple’s future but also the broader cryptocurrency industry. Ripple’s Legal Costs Draw Criticism This has nothing to do with money but a tactical move to keep pressure on Ripple. Even after the win, the legal fight isn’t limited to securities law. Ripple recently submitted a detailed report of its legal expenses, seeking reimbursement for costs incurred during its courtroom battles. However, Sostack has formally objected to these claims. The objection urges the court to delay any decision on Ripple’s expenses until the appeal is resolved. It also pushes for a reduction or outright rejection of the claimed costs. While the focus seems financial, this is likely a strategic move to maintain pressure on Ripple and keep the litigation alive. Curious about the Ripple vs. SEC drama? Read XRP price prediction to see how this legal battle could impact XRP’s future growth! What to Expect Next So, what happens now? The case is heading to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where it’ll be reviewed again. For Ripple, it’s one more hurdle as the company also prepares for a critical SEC deadline on January 15. Meanwhile, some in the crypto community are keeping an eye on SEC Chair Gary Gensler , who’s set to step down on January 20. Could his last days in office bring new challenges for Ripple? It’s hard to say, but the stakes couldn’t be higher. Ripple’s wins in court have been significant. But this appeal could still shake things up, not just for Ripple but for the future of cryptocurrency regulations . .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin started in 2013 as a fun twist on digital money. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it features a cute Shiba Inu dog as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin's limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no cap on total supply. What began as a joke quickly caught on. In 2021, Dogecoin's value soared, reaching a market cap over $50 billion. This surge was driven by social media buzz, especially tweets from Elon Musk. The coin showed how online communities and social media can shape financial markets. So, what makes Dogecoin stand out today? Its technology is simple and based on existing cryptocurrency models. It doesn't have advanced features like some other coins. However, its strength lies in its community and widespread recognition. With influential supporters and a friendly image, Dogecoin continues to attract attention. In the current market, where many investors seek the next big thing, Dogecoin offers familiarity and potential. While other coins focus on complex technology, Dogecoin’s appeal is its simplicity. Whether it's a good investment depends on market trends and personal goals, but Dogecoin remains a unique player in the crypto world. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin but with its own twist. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous creator named Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work smoothly with other parts of the Ethereum world. At the start, there were a quadrillion SHIB tokens. Half of them were sent to Vitalik Buterin, the co-creator of Ethereum, to build trust. Buterin then donated a large amount to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and ""burned"" 40% of the total supply. These actions brought a lot of attention to SHIB. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB's connection to Ethereum opens up many possibilities. It allows for projects like ShibaSwap, where users can trade tokens without a middleman. There's also talk of a future platform for unique digital items and a system where the community can have a say in decisions. These features could give SHIB more uses and make it stand out. In the current market, where people are looking for coins with real-world applications, SHIB's plans might make it attractive to investors. Compared to other memecoins, SHIB seems to be aiming for more than just internet hype. Conclusion While DOGE and SHIB are still valued, XYZVerse's sports-themed memecoin offers unique growth potential, drawing investors in the current 2024 bull run.

For savvy investors, picking the right altcoins now could be the key to a life-changing 2025. Choosing poorly might mean missing out on massive returns, or worse, ending up with losses. BlockDAG (BDAG) , Stellar (XML), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) stand out as the top altcoins for the next bull run due to their tech and growth potential. From powering decentralized applications to solving real-world problems in finance and technology—read on to spot the unique strengths of each! 1. BlockDAG: Crypto’s Hottest Presale Star BlockDAG (BDAG) is the name on everyone’s lips this altcoin season and for good reason. Positioned as the backbone for future blockchain projects, BlockDAG combines its superior technology with massive community interest to create long-term value for holders and developers alike. Priced at just $0.0234 in presale batch 26, BlockDAG has already raised over $161.5 million and sold more than 17 billion coins since its presale began. Early holders have enjoyed a substantial 2,240% ROI, and the excitement keeps building as the project approaches its $600 million crypto presale 2025 goal. This Layer 1 blockchain leverages Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology to enhance scalability and reduce network congestion, making it ideal for decentralized applications and even meme coin creation. BlockDAG’s low-code, no-code platform empowers developers to launch innovative projects with minimal or no coding skills, ensuring its long-term utility and dominance in the market. The hype around BlockDAG is further amplified by its BDAG250 bonus offer driving a fresh surge in demand. This 5-stage offer unlocks bonuses of over 150% across the first five purchases, enticing new and existing holders alike. Whether developers are looking for a scalable blockchain or traders are chasing high returns, BlockDAG checks all the boxes as one of the top altcoins for the next bull run. 2. Stellar: Bridging Traditional Finance and Blockchain Stellar (XLM) has carved a niche as the bridge between traditional fiat systems and blockchain technology. By enabling seamless international payments, tokenized assets, and decentralized applications, Stellar enhances financial interoperability. Its partnerships with financial institutions and the Soroban smart contract upgrade have expanded its use cases, particularly in cross-border transactions and DeFi. Stellar’s trading volume has recently surged, signaling growing investor interest. However, critics point out that Stellar’s reliance on partnerships with centralized institutions might limit its appeal to decentralization advocates. But for those seeking a project with real-world utility and consistent growth potential, Stellar remains one of the top altcoins for the next bull run. 3. Solana: The Speed Demon of Blockchain Solana (SOL) is one of the fastest and most efficient blockchain platforms, capable of processing an astounding 65,000 transactions per second. Its proof-of-history consensus ensures reduced latency and enhanced network performance, making it a go-to platform for DeFi applications, gaming, and complex trading systems. While Solana’s speed and scalability are unmatched, its network has faced occasional downtime, raising concerns about reliability. Despite this hiccup, the platform’s commitment to continuous improvements keeps it ahead of the competition. 4. Cardano: A Scientific Approach to Blockchain Cardano (ADA) is a methodical, research-driven development. Designed with sustainability, interoperability, and scalability in mind, Cardano integrates seamlessly with decentralized applications and boasts high-assurance code. Its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism offers energy efficiency, making it one of the greenest blockchain systems available. However, Cardano’s slow and deliberate rollout of features has been a point of criticism, as some traders favor quicker-moving projects. Still, its rigorous approach ensures a strong and secure ecosystem that delivers long-term value. For those prioritizing stability and a well-researched framework, Cardano remains in the running as one of the top altcoins for the next bull run. Choose Wisely for Life-Changing Gains in 2025 Each one of these top altcoins for the next bull run brings something unique to the table. Stellar simplifies cross-border payments, Solana boasts unparalleled speed, and Cardano offers a secure, sustainable ecosystem. BlockDAG, however, is the most versatile option on the list. Its DAG technology, developer-friendly tools, and explosive BDAG250 bonus system make it an unrivaled choice for both traders and developers. Whether enthusiasts are chasing sky-high ROIs or building the next big decentralized project, BlockDAG provides the foundation for the next generation of crypto success stories.

37544528,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392296,1734009469,Crypto-Friendly Leader? a16z’s Brian Quintenz to Be Next CFTC Chair,"The post Crypto-Friendly Leader? a16z’s Brian Quintenz to Be Next CFTC Chair appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As Donald Trump’s administration forms, Brian Quintenz, a former U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) commissioner, has emerged as a top contender for the role of CFTC Chair. If appointed, his leadership could bring much-needed clarity and a more crypto-friendly approach to U.S. regulations. Top Pick For CFTC Chair Reports suggest that Quintenz has already been interviewed for the position. With extensive experience in policymaking and his current role as head of policy at Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto division, a16z, he stands out as a strong candidate. During his time at the CFTC from 2017 to 2021, Quintenz focused on integrating digital assets into the agency’s framework. He worked to encourage innovation while ensuring fairness in the markets and protecting investors. At a16z, a major player in crypto investments, Quintenz continues to promote blockchain and digital assets. The firm has supported notable projects like Maker, Solana, Avalanche, Aptos, EigenLayer, Lido, Nansen, OpenSea, and Coinbase, strengthening its influence in the crypto sector. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ukraine to Legalize Crypto in 2025, but Here’s the Catch , Regulatory Battle: CFTC vs. SEC Quintenz’s potential leadership comes at a time of regulatory confusion. The debate over whether the CFTC or SEC should oversee specific crypto assets has created uncertainty for the industry. Quintenz has been openly critical of the SEC’s inconsistent approach , particularly regarding Ether (ETH). He recently pointed out that the SEC’s approval of Ether futures ETFs conflicted with its suggestion that ETH might be a security. His views highlight the need for clear and consistent regulations in the crypto space. What Could His Appointment Mean for Crypto? Many analysts are optimistic that Quintenz’s leadership could pave the way for a friendlier regulatory environment. With pro-crypto appointments like Paul Atkins at the SEC, the Trump administration seems poised to address longstanding concerns over regulatory clarity. If appointed, Quintenz’s vision could play a key role in shaping a future where innovation thrives alongside fair regulation. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37544436,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374389,1734009299,Billionaire Thomas Peterffy Warns: More Than 10% Bitcoin Exposure Is ‘Too Dangerous’,"Thomas Peterffy, Chairman of Interactive Brokers, has expressed a cautious endorsement of Bitcoin as a component of investment portfolios. During a Bloomberg podcast released on Thursday, Peterffy suggested allocating 2% to 3% of one’s net worth to Bitcoin, warning that going beyond 10% could pose “too dangerous” financial risks. His comments highlight a balanced perspective, advocating for diversification while acknowledging the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies. Peterffy’s Bitcoin Advice The 80-year-old Hungarian-born American billionaire businessman shared his personal apprehensions about the volatile nature of digital assets and admitted being “scared” of them. He described them as having no intrinsic value, comparing their worth to that of fiat currency, which he said also lacks a tangible foundation. According to Peterffy, Bitcoin’s perceived value is rooted purely in collective belief, making it susceptible to significant price swings. He further cautioned against the growing trend of market participants taking on excessive leverage, warning that a sudden crash in its price could lead to bankruptcies on a massive scale and strain financial clearinghouses. It is important to note that despite Peterffy’s stance, Interactive Brokers has been a player in the cryptocurrency industry since December 2017, when it introduced Bitcoin futures trading on the CBOE Futures Exchange. By September 2021, the Connecticut-headquartered brokerage firm expanded its services by partnering with Paxos Trust Company, allowing clients to trade and hold cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Peterffy’s comments align with those of other industry veterans like Bill Miller, who recently suggested that financial advisors might soon recommend Bitcoin allocations of 1% to 3%. Miller highlighted Bitcoin’s unique economic design, which ensures that its supply remains static regardless of demand or price fluctuations, adding to its long-term investment appeal. Businesses Embrace Bitcoin for Treasury Reserves Following Donald Trump’s election victory, Bitcoin’s value shattered $100,000, fueled by expectations of a more lenient regulatory stance on the industry. Businesses have responded by incorporating Bitcoin into their cash reserves, challenging traditional assets as firms explore alternatives for inflation protection. Recently, online streaming and video platform Rumble announced that its Board approved a strategy to diversify its treasury, allocating up to $20 million in surplus cash into Bitcoin. Biotech firms, including Enlivex Therapeutics, Acurx Pharmaceuticals, and Hoth Therapeutics, also unveiled plans to allocate up to $1 million each in Bitcoin for their treasury reserves. Similarly, Amazon shareholders have urged the tech giant to adopt Bitcoin as part of its $88 billion treasury, highlighting its inflation-hedging potential. Globally, India’s Jetking Infotrain made history on December 9 by becoming the first Indian public company to purchase Bitcoin, acquiring 12 BTC for its reserves.

37545366,https://invezz.com/?p=2384847,1734009284,How Trump’s billionaire Cabinet sparks conflict-of-interest concerns,"Donald Trump has redefined the Republican Party, embracing a populist platform centered on the working-class while maintaining skepticism of corporate power. However, his second-term Cabinet appointments appear to challenge that narrative, as the president-elect surrounds himself with a group of wealthy business executives and investors. These appointments, which include billionaires and Wall Street veterans with complex financial ties, have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest spanning multiple industries, from defense and healthcare to cryptocurrency, according to a report by Politico . Wealth and influence: Trump’s high-profile picks Among the most notable figures joining Trump’s new administration are Howard Lutnick, CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, as Commerce Secretary; Warren Stephens, CEO of an Arkansas financial services firm, as Ambassador to the UK; and Jared Isaacman, a billionaire entrepreneur and presumptive NASA Administrator. Also on the list is Steve Feinberg, a private equity titan, as Deputy Defense Secretary. Delaney Marsco, director of ethics at the Campaign Legal Center, highlighted the risks associated with these choices in the report: It opens up the door for there being a lot more possible conflicts of interest because their personal wealth is so vast. These appointments are emblematic of Trump’s unique blend of populism and deference to economic elites. Despite his criticism of corporate power, Trump has consistently relied on business leaders to fill key roles, arguing that their experience can help drive his administration’s agenda. To be sure, Trump is widely anticipated to advance policies spanning trade, labor, and antitrust that reflect the populist platform of his campaign. Notably, some choices, such as Lori Chavez-DeRemer, the presumptive nominee for Labor Secretary and a figure viewed as union-friendly, signal a departure from traditional pre-Trump Republican priorities. Ethical challenges and criticism The potential conflicts of interest in Trump’s administration have become an early target for Democrats and ethics watchdogs. Dr. Mehmet Oz, the president’s pick to lead Medicare and Medicaid, faces intense scrutiny for his financial ties to private health insurers and prior advocacy for Medicare privatization. In a letter to Oz on Tuesday, Democratic lawmakers demanded assurances that he would divest his holdings in the insurance industry if confirmed. Meanwhile, Trump’s Treasury Secretary pick, hedge fund executive Scott Bessent, has drawn criticism from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) for his financial background, which she argues aligns more with enriching the wealthy than aiding working families. Howard Lutnick, tapped for Commerce Secretary, has pledged to step down from his companies and divest his holdings upon Senate confirmation. Through his firm Cantor Fitzgerald, he maintains close ties to Tether , a controversial foreign cryptocurrency company. This connection could draw scrutiny, particularly in light of Trump’s commitment to revamping cryptocurrency regulations during his second term. Elon Musk’s unconventional role Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, presents a particularly unusual case in Trump’s administration. Appointed to head the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) , Musk’s position exists outside federal oversight, exempting him from standard conflict-of-interest laws. Critics argue that Musk’s proximity to Trump could allow him to influence policies and regulations that benefit his business empire, which includes Tesla, SpaceX, and Starlink. By deploying his wealth to serve as the president’s enforcer, Musk may be able to shape policies while remaining largely unchecked. Balancing populism with elite influence Despite these concerns, conflict-of-interest issues have not dominated the political discourse, reflecting a shift in public expectations under Trump’s leadership. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) defended the appointments, stating, The founding fathers wanted folks coming from the business communities to be a part of this process, and that’s healthy. However, the potential for clashes looms as some GOP moderates weigh the risks of backing nominees ahead of their own reelection bids in 2026. Trump’s Cabinet selections underscore the balancing act between his populist messaging and the realities of governance. Morgan Ackley, a spokeswoman for Trump’s transition team, defended the picks as necessary for achieving the administration’s ambitious goals. “These highly qualified men and women have the talent, experience, and necessary skill sets to Make America Great Again,” Ackley said.

Here's Why,"The Federal Court of Australia has ordered Bit Trade, the operating company behind Australian crypto exchange Kraken, to pay a fine of AUD 8 million (approximately $5.1 million) for failing to comply with regulatory requirements. Kraken's Australian Operator Fined $5 Million for Regulatory Violations The decision comes after a lawsuit filed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), which accused Bit Trade of offering a margin trading product without proper authorization. Between October 2021 and August 2023, Bit Trade allegedly failed to identify a target market before rolling out its margin extension product to over 1,100 clients. This oversight reportedly led to client losses exceeding $5.2 million. ASIC argued that Bit Trade’s actions breached Australian financial laws and initially sought a penalty of AUD 20 million. Bit Trade argued that any fine should not exceed AUD 4 million, but the court ultimately ruled for a penalty of AUD 8 million. Kraken expressed disappointment with the outcome, highlighting the challenges posed by unclear regulatory frameworks for crypto businesses in Australia. “We appreciate the court’s compliance efforts, but believe this case underscores the urgent need for specific crypto legislation to eliminate confusion and uncertainty for investors and businesses,” a Kraken spokesperson said. ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court stressed the regulator’s commitment to holding crypto firms accountable, saying the decision demonstrated the importance of ensuring compliance to protect investors. The court ordered Bit Trade to pay the fine within 60 days and cover ASIC’s legal costs. Kraken said the decision reflected regulatory uncertainty in Australia and reiterated its call for more definitive crypto legislation. *This is not investment advice.

This initiative aims to strengthen the security of its protocol and foster trust in its ecosystem by incentivizing researchers to identify vulnerabilities. The bug bounty program, announced on December 12, invites security researchers to uncover flaws in Compound’s systems. The payouts are based on the severity of the vulnerabilities discovered and can range from $1,000 for low-risk issues to $1 million for critical exploits. These rewards will be paid in COMP, Compound’s native token. New Bug Bounty Program alert! @compoundfinance , the DeFi protocol for money markets, just launched a $1 MILLION bug bounty program on Immunefi Ready to secure the future of decentralized finance? This has the details pic.twitter.com/H8NiHZ8enG — Immunefi (@immunefi) December 12, 2024 How Confident Is Compound Finance on Their Security? Compound Finance, founded in 2017 by Robert Leshner and Geoffrey Hayes, operates as an algorithmic money market platform. It enables users to borrow and lend cryptocurrencies while earning or paying interest rates determined by supply and demand. Compound has attracted backing from notable investors such as Andreessen Horowitz and Bain Capital Ventures. The launch of this bug bounty program follows a significant year for Compound, particularly as DeFi has faced heightened scrutiny following high-profile exploits . For instance, in October 2023, a fork of the Compound protocol, known as Onyx Protocol, suffered a $2.1 million exploit due to a known vulnerability in its inherited code. While Compound itself has not encountered a direct exploit of this nature, the event is a close warning for Compound, which resulted in heightened security, such as in this newly launched bounty program. Compound’s latest protocol iteration, Compound III, also introduces streamlined features that enhance scalability and efficiency. These latest security developments also ensure the robustness of its infrastructure, maintaining user trust and safeguarding billions in total value locked (TVL). Bug Bounty Program Details The bug bounty program aims to engage a global network of security researchers to scrutinize its systems by leveraging Immunefi’s platform, which provides easy access. The reward structure is tiered, with critical vulnerabilities offering payouts of up to $1 million or 10% of affected funds, whichever is lower. Source: Immunefi on Medium This structure ensures that the most severe threats, such as those enabling theft or freezing of funds, are addressed swiftly and effectively. The Compound DAO will handle payouts, with USD-denominated rewards converted into COMP tokens based on average market prices at the report submission time. The program also includes safeguards for repeatable attacks, where compromised smart contracts cannot be paused or upgraded. In such cases, the reward will be calculated based on the total cumulative damage, ensuring comprehensive coverage for potential threats. Bounty Boom in Crypto Nowadays, bug bounty has become a tool for testing platform security. According to a recent report, Uniswap Labs launched a record-breaking $15.5 million bug bounty program targeting vulnerabilities in its v4 core contracts.

Developers who identify unique vulnerabilities must maintain confidentiality until issues are resolved, and qualifying submissions may earn public recognition alongside rewards in USDC. The program follows extensive security measures, including nine independent audits and a $2.35 million security competition, as Uniswap prepares for deployment.

As massive institutions and sovereign countries climb aboard, the adoption curve is about to get a lot steeper. El Salvador becomes more flexible to accommodate IMF When one thinks of Bitcoin adoption on the sovereign level, El Salvador will normally spring to mind. The very first country to make Bitcoin legal tender, following the lead of its far-sighted President Nayib Bukele, El Salvador has ploughed a lonely furrow up till now, with dire warnings from the IMF as to what would happen with such a policy in place. However, despite this, El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin has done wonders for the country, as its holdings have produced more than $300 million in profit thus far. Nevertheless, the IMF is back again, and this time has obliged El Salvador to make some changes to its Bitcoin policy , one of the many strings attached to an IMF loan. Thankfully, the strings in this respect are not too onerous, and among other things they require El Salvador to change its Bitcoin law so that not all businesses are obliged to accept Bitcoin for payments. Another requirement is that El Salvador increase its foreign reserves. Besides accommodating the IMF for this important $1.3 billion loan, this should also facilitate loans from other major lenders such as the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. US and Russia among world powers looking at Bitcoin adoption Other countries are on the verge of adopting Bitcoin in a big way, and these include some of the world’s preeminent economic powers. The US is in the throes of a complete turn around in its attitude to Bitcoin, with Donald Trump assuming the presidential mantle in January. Besides filling his administration’s top jobs with mostly pro-bitcoiners, Trump has said that he wants to set up a U.S. Bitcoin strategic reserve. At the same time, various U.S. states are moving forward with plans for their own individual strategic Bitcoin reserves. It’s not just the United States. A dialogue is taking place in Russian government circles as to the possibility of setting up a strategic Bitcoin reserve . On top of this, it must be wondered just how many other countries are also considering this, or have even started to mine or secretly buy Bitcoin, thus getting ahead in the potential Bitcoin buying arms race. Bitcoin continues to respect uptrend Source: TradingView The short-term time frame for $BTC looks promising. A good level of support/resistance is developing at the $98,200 horizontal line. A recent breakout of a potential triangle has taken place, although it may well be that more price action could see another pattern emerge. The more time that price action can spend above this support level, the more likely it will be that this could be a base for the next upward thrust. MACD continues bullish on 2-week chart Source: TradingView On the 2-week chart the fantastic progress that Bitcoin has made since breaking above the previous bull market top of $69,000 is totally evident. At the bottom of the chart, the MACD indicator, which gives buy and sell signals, is showing that it is very bullish. The blue line is above the orange signal line, with the jaws of these two lines wide open. Also, the dark green bars below are still being formed. The next bar is due to print at the end of this week. If it is a bigger, dark green bar, then expect buying to continue, and price to keep going up.

The attack caused 69% of its active nodes to crash. The breach has raised questions about the security of the cryptocurrency’s infrastructure and its resilience to potential future attacks. Andreas Kohl, co-founder of Bitcoin sidechain Sequentia, revealed he was responsible for the hack on his X account. Kohl stated that he executed the exploit from an “old ThinkPad in rural El Salvador.” I used a publicly disclosed (by @TobiasRuck ) vulnerability to take down 69% of the Dogecoin network from an old thinkpad in rural el salvador. AMA. https://t.co/BNkGDWkWhu pic.twitter.com/qk16AwMaq5 — Andreas Kohl (@aejkohl) December 12, 2024 According to Blockchair data, Dogecoin had 647 active nodes before the attack, but the number dropped sharply to 315 following the breach. Kohl exploited a vulnerability identified by researcher Tobias Ruck to conduct the attack. An X account called “Department Of DOGE Efficiency” first brought the issue to public attention on December 4. The account explained what it called the “DogeReaper” vulnerability, which could reportedly crash Dogecoin nodes remotely. The “DogeReaper” vulnerability explained The “DogeReaper” exploit was likened to the fictional “Death Note” from Japanese manga and anime, where writing a name in a notebook could cause a person’s death. According to the Department Of DOGE Efficiency, the vulnerability worked similarly, allowing an attacker to target a Dogecoin node’s address and cause it to crash via a segmentation fault. In computing, segmentation faults occur when a program attempts to access memory it isn’t permitted to use. This triggers the operating system to halt the program, resulting in a crash. Our monitoring made us aware that the vulnerability appears to have been exploited, and almost 69% of the Dogecoin network has crashed 😳😳😳 Blockchair shows how the number of public nodes. Before, it was 647, and at the time of writing it is just 205. https://t.co/SufuVMmeoP pic.twitter.com/knnhTGgTJO — Department Of DOGE Efficiency (@EfficiencyDOGE) December 12, 2024 The account warned of the catastrophic potential of the vulnerability, noting that Dogecoin nodes are publicly accessible. They suggested that a malicious actor could have exploited the flaw to halt the entire network, disrupting transactions and block generation for several days. “If a malicious actor would’ve found this bug instead of us, they could have stopped the Dogecoin network for at least a few days, with no transactions or blocks,” the account wrote. While Kohl’s exploit did not completely halt the blockchain’s operations, the significant reduction in active nodes raises concerns about the network’s decentralization and robustness. Efforts to patch the issue and restore node functionality are ongoing. Dogecoin price performance The security breach comes during a period of market volatility for DOGE. After a 208% surge in early November, the cryptocurrency has been trading within a tight range of $0.35 to $0.48 over the past month. According to Coinmarketcap data, DOGE is trading at $0.41 at press time. Dogecoin (DOGE) price movement. Source: CoinMarketCap This week, Dogecoin saw a 12% decline, breaking below an ascending trendline, signaling a potential bearish shift. However, some analysts see a possible rebound. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade highlighted that Dogecoin’s relative strength index (RSI) had reset after hitting overbought levels earlier this year. In March 2024, a similar RSI reset to 50 preceded a significant uptrend, suggesting that a breakout above $0.50 could be imminent. Further analysis from Santiment, a data analytics platform, pointed to bullish signals for Dogecoin. The platform noted that the “mean dollar invested age,” which tracks the average age of coins in circulation, has decreased by 31% over the past eight weeks. This trend suggests that previously dormant coins are moving back into circulation, potentially bolstering market activity. Santiment shared its observations on social media, noting that the renewed activity among dormant coins could indicate growing investor interest in Dogecoin despite the recent downturn.

While analysts acknowledge the cryptocurrency's resilience, they predict limited upside in the near term as technical indicators reveal weakening momentum. Meanwhile, crypto whales appear to be exploring alternatives, with Yeti Ouro (YETIO), a utility-driven meme coin, attracting significant attention by raising over $1 million in its ongoing presale. Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE Struggles At Key Support Amid Market Weakness Dogecoin price of $0.40 places it in a crucial technical support zone, testing the lower boundary of its recent upward regression channel. Over the past month, Dogecoin has demonstrated impressive gains, surging by 160% in November and reaching a December peak of $0.4846. However, recent selling pressure caused the cryptocurrency to break below its ascending trendline, signaling potential short-term correction. DOGE price of $0.35 support level is considered a vital zone for buyers, with analysts noting that it aligns closely with the 50% Fibonacci retracement from October lows of $0.10. Resistance remains strong at $0.44 and $0.48-$0.50 while breaking these levels could open the path to its 2021 all-time high of $0.70. Still, bearish divergences in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the breakdown of key trendlines suggest that a sustained rally may face challenges. Source X Liquidation data further indicates market uncertainty, with $27 million in DOGE positions liquidated in the past 24 hours, $20 million of which were longs. Despite these challenges, Dogecoin's performance in 2024 remains robust, boasting a 350% gain, nearly triple that of Bitcoin. Yeti Ouro Gains Momentum As Crypto Whales Shift To Presale Investment While Dogecoin battles technical resistance, Yeti Ouro has emerged as a promising alternative for investors seeking high-growth opportunities. Yeti Ouro combines the meme coin appeal with real-world utility through its integration with Yeti Go, a play-to-earn (P2E) racing game built on Unreal Engine. The Yeti Ouro presale has attracted substantial interest, raising $1.02 million in its first stage, with 85.2% of tokens sold. With only 4 days left before price increase investors are flocking to YETIO presale. The coin's capped supply of 1 billion tokens and 5% burn mechanism create a scarcity-driven model, further increasing its appeal. ""Yeti Ouro offers an exciting blend of gaming rewards and utility, which sets it apart in the crowded cryptocurrency market,"" a spokesperson for the project stated. Early adopters are capitalizing on the presale, anticipating potential returns as the project progresses. Yeti Go: The Play-to-Earn Game Driving Yeti Ouro's Popularity A key factor behind Yeti Ouro's presale success is its association with Yeti Go, a P2E racing game poised to redefine multiplayer gaming. Built on Unreal Engine 5, the game promises fast-paced, elimination-style races with in-game rewards tied to YETIO tokens. The development team recently announced that game mechanics and level designs have been optimized to ensure smooth, immersive gameplay. Yeti Go also features dynamic object interactions and environments designed to enhance replayability. Yeti Go's unique integration of blockchain technology and high-quality gaming has positioned it as a standout project.

In this dogecoin price news , According to ""Crow,"" a notable Bitcoin analyst in the crypto community, Dogecoin's path to a new multi-year high at $0.66 is straightforward, but many remain skeptical. He shared this sentiment in a tweet following Dogecoin's rebound after testing crucial support in the $0.30 region.Notably, on Tuesday, Dogecoin's price dropped to $0.36 but has since rebounded to trade at $0.4234 today, marking a 15% resurgence since the dip.Dogecoin ""Easy"" Path to $0.66Following this rebound, analyst Crow shared a chart predicting the patterns Dogecoin could follow in the coming days based on the meme coin's consistent price action within an ascending pattern. He expects Dogecoin to first rise to near $0.48 before facing a rejection that would drive its price back down to $0.46.Dogecoin initially encountered a rejection at this level on December 8, which led to a retest of $0.36 shortly after. However, this analyst expects a smaller pullback this time, which would set the foundation for a run to a fresh multi-year high at $0.52.This level aligns with the top of the ascending channel, and the analyst envisions another short-term correction to test the $0.50 psychological level. A successful rebound from this move is expected to send Dogecoin toward the $0.66 region.According to Crow, it is easy for Dogecoin to follow this pattern within the next two weeks, but critics who believe the meme coin has lost momentum would likely disagree.

Some industry insiders suggest that the appearance of these ads might be short-lived, exploiting fleeting loopholes rather than signaling a permanent shift. Despite this, the mere presence of such promotions is noteworthy, given the Chinese government’s historically harsh stance against direct cryptocurrency trading and transactions. Alipay itself had formally banned Bitcoin-related transactions back in 2019, aligning with the broader anti-crypto directives from Beijing. China’s strict regulatory environment led to the exile of top crypto exchanges and a comprehensive crackdown on all forms of crypto trading in recent years. The ads’ appearance comes amid a bull market and swirling rumors of potential regulatory softening in China towards cryptocurrencies. While the mainland has not shown any clear signs of reversing its ban, actions by companies like Hangzhou-based Nano Labs, which began accepting Bitcoin through Coinbase, suggest a potential policy change to crypto transactions within the country’s borders. Furthermore, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), former CEO of Binance, has hinted at the possibility of a Bitcoin reserve in China during his speech at the 2024 Bitcoin MENA Conference in Abu Dhabi. “[A Chinese Bitcoin Reserve is] inevitable – they have to do it at some point because it’s the only ‘hard’ asset.

37545103,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51971,1734008116,Ripple CTO States Why RLUSD Won’t Replace XRP,"In a recent development that has captured the attention of the cryptocurrency community, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, clarified the relationship between Ripple’s newly introduced RLUSD stablecoin and XRP. The comments were made in a video shared widely on social media, where Schwartz addressed concerns about the implications of RLUSD for XRP and the broader Ripple ecosystem. Will RLUSD Replace XRP? Schwartz opened his remarks by acknowledging a common question: Whether RLUSD introduction signals a reduced commitment to XRP or even as a replacement. He firmly dismissed these notions, emphasizing that the stablecoin initiative is not intended to undermine or compete with XRP. “So one question that I hear a lot is what the Ripple stablecoin means for XRP and like, does this reflect some reduction in our commitment to XRP or is this a replacement for XRP? And I think obviously the answer to that is no,” Schwartz stated. He further elaborated on the roles of RLUSD and XRP within Ripple’s decentralized exchange (DEX). According to Schwartz, RLUSD as a stable asset on the DEX aligns with Ripple’s broader goals of increasing liquidity, boosting trading volume, and enhancing the overall ecosystem. XRP as a Bridge Asset Ripple’s focus remains on XRP as a bridge asset within the DEX, particularly through features such as auto-bridging. Schwartz highlighted that XRP’s role as a bridge asset is integral to facilitating seamless transactions across various assets on the XRP Ledger. He described the introduction of RLUSD as a move to expand the number of credible assets available on the platform, which strengthens the ecosystem and benefits XRP. “We want there to be more credible assets on the DEX, we want trading volume, you know, we think that XRP has a unique role on the DEX as a bridge asset,” he explained. “More volume on the XRP Ledger is a good thing, you know, both for XRP and for the ecosystem.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The crypto community responded positively to Schwartz’s clarification. One X user, Monica, commented , “That’s an important clarification! It’s great to see that RLUSD and XRP will have distinct roles, with XRP serving as a bridge asset on the DEX. This could enhance the overall ecosystem and functionality. Exciting times ahead!” Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD represents a strategic addition to the XRP Ledger, showcasing Ripple’s commitment to fostering an ecosystem with diverse assets and increased utility. The emphasis on XRP’s unique function as a bridge asset reaffirms its centrality to Ripple’s vision for the future of decentralized finance. As Ripple continues to innovate, the company’s approach of balancing new initiatives with its core commitments provides insight into its long-term strategy. For XRP holders and ecosystem participants, Schwartz’s statement offers reassurance that XRP remains a cornerstone of Ripple’s efforts to redefine global payments and decentralized finance.

Interestingly, $1.135 trillion was added in 2024 alone since January 1, when BTC had a $865.07 billion capitalization. This market cap is calculated by multiplying Bitcoin’s current circulating supply of nearly 19.80 million BTC by its unitary price of $100,500. Things, however, can get more significant when looking to more precise metrics such as the realized cap, according to analysts. Bitcoin Market Cap (USD), daily chart. Source: TradingView / Finbold / Vini Barbosa Bitcoin realized cap nearly doubled in 2024 alone In particular, onchain analyst Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, believes that realized cap is a better metric. According to him, the market cap “doesn’t fully capture actual capital inflows as not all transactions occur on exchanges.” “On-chain data provides a more comprehensive perspective,” Ki Young Ju said in a recent post on December 12. “With metrics like realized market cap offering a more accurate measure of inflows by tracking real-time Bitcoin transactions.” Essentially, the realized cap multiplies Bitcoin’s supply by BTC price when an address (UTXO) moves it for the last time. When the realized cap is lower than the market cap, it means that Bitcoin holders are in aggregated profit. Meanwhile, a higher realized cap than the current market cap indicates an aggregated loss for the network participants. In another post on X, the onchain analyst highlighted that Bitcoin added $80 billion in realized cap monthly during 2024. “This year alone, $339 billion worth of Bitcoin has been purchased, according to the realized cap,” Ki Young Ju detailed. Bitcoin 15-year Realized Cap. Source: CryptoQuant / Ki Young Ju “I remember we’re talking the numbers like $100 million in 2017, $1 billion in 2021,” he concluded. “Now it’s $100 billion. We would be talking $1 trillion in the next few years.” If the capital inflow to Bitcoin continues in this rhythm, investors could see even more significant price appreciation and adoption moving forward into 2025. However, it is important to understand that the more participants in profit, the more likely they are to sell at one point, seeking to realize this profit against the current market cap. A significant selling pressure could cause a capital outflow and negatively affect the BTC price. Looking into 2025 price predictions, prominent Wall Street analysts like Tom Lee believe Bitcoin could reach $250,000 by year-end. Similarly, the $870 billion baking giant Standard Chartered forecasts a BTC price of $200,000 next year. Featured image from Shutterstock.

37543686,https://crypto.news/?p=14318648,1734007902,What are security tokens? The ultimate guide,"You probably come across a lot of paperwork and restrictions when it comes to buying a piece of real estate or a company share in the real world. Security tokens offer a solution to this problem by becoming a digital representation of your real-world asset in the blockchain world. Table of Contents What is a security token? Types of security tokens Advantages of security tokens Security token vs cryptocurrency Challenges and risks The future of security tokens In this article, we’ll take a deep dive into what are security tokens, their types, how they work, and their future in the cryptocurrency world. What is a security token? Security tokens are the bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. These non-tangible tokens represent your ownership in the real world and hence make the whole process of buying, selling, and trading real-world assets a whole lot easier. It can be any real-world asset including real estate, stocks, bonds, or even a piece of art. If it’s tangible and can be bought and sold, it can be tied to a security token through which ownership can be transferred easily from one person to another. While normal cryptocurrencies may not be subject to many regulations, tokens acting as security must abide by stringent regulatory laws to keep operating as a security. They are usually issued through a process known as Security Token Offering (STO), in which interested investors buy tokens that represent their ownership of any physical or digital asset in the real world. Now that we’ve explained security tokens, let’s learn how they work. You might also like: What are utility tokens? Understanding their function and benefits How do security tokens work? Security tokens operate on blockchain platforms that are coded through smart contracts that abide by strict laws of ownership and transfer, coded within them. Each token represents an ownership or a real-world asset, and anyone who owns a token acting as security has a legal claim to a share of the asset to which the token is tied. As discussed above, these tokens are issued through an STO which ensures the rights of both the issuer and investor of the token. Blockchain and smart contracts play a key role in automatically calculating and transferring ownership of security tokens from one party to another without the need for third-party intermediaries. Furthermore, anyone can own a fraction of a real-world asset and isn’t bound to buy the whole asset, making this concept even more attractive for global investors. Types of security tokens There are many types and examples of security tokens in the real world, however, not all of them are popular. Here we will discuss some of the most commonly used tokens that act as securities for real-world assets: Debt tokens: Companies can issue debt tokens that represent loans or bonds issued by them, and these tokens are then used for paying interest to token holders over time. Equity tokens: Equity tokens are given to anyone who purchases a company’s share or ownership. In return for buying equity tokens, a person can vote on governance matters and claim the company’s profits as long as they hold the equity tokens and don’t transfer them to another user. Asset-backed tokens: Asset-backed tokens are one of the classic security tokens examples, as they tied to tangible assets like real estate, gold, or artwork. These tokens give investors fractional ownership of these assets, making these big markets easier to access for a global audience. Each type of token that acts as security offers unique opportunities for investors to diversify their portfolios and gain exposure to new asset classes while maintaining compliance with regulations. Advantages of security tokens Security tokens offer a lot of advantages to the global financial ecosystem which includes investors, issuers of these tokens, and the general public as well. Here are some of them: Liquidity: Limited access means less liquidity and this restriction is lifted when real-world assets are tied to securities which are represented by digital tokens that can be bought by anyone in the world without much paperwork or travel. Transparency: Every transaction on the blockchain has a permanent record, is secure, and is tamper-proof and all of this promotes transparency between the issuer of the tokens and the investors as well. Fractional Ownership: Not everyone has the same level of financial capacity to buy an expensive piece of art or real estate. Instead, tokens acting as security allow everyone to buy some part of a real-world asset and sell their part of the asset in profits, when that asset has appreciated over time. Automation: The lack of human involvement on the blockchain on which these tokens operate, reduces any administrative costs and errors. Real-world assets are bought and sold seamlessly, and dividend distribution and ownership transfers happen within seconds by following automated hard-coded laws in the blockchain’s smart contract.

You see cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum are digital money that are traded on crypto exchanges and are primarily not tied to any asset or claim, and are purely used as a store of monetary value. On the other hand, tokens acting as security directly represent ownership of assets in the real world. They are also required to follow strict laws of traditional investments in the real world. Cryptocurrencies are unregulated and often decentralized, while tokens issued as securities are issued in a legal environment with regulated and documented laws. Challenges and risks Regulatory uncertainty poses the biggest challenge and risk in the mass adoption of tokens that are deemed as securities or plan to apply for becoming a security token. While many countries have shown interest in this concept, there is still confusion about when proper laws will be formed around these tokens that provide a sense of security for investors and issuers alike. Not being widely accepted also means that liquidity can be a big problem as they are not yet traded on traditional exchanges. A limited market means it is difficult for a common investor to invest in tokens acting as security and choose to go for traditional cryptocurrencies instead. Also, the technology behind these tokens on the blockchain is still evolving, which means a potential threat of security breaches is possible. The future of security tokens According to several experts, tokens registered as security have a bright future ahead of them and will completely transform the financial sector. This means that the capacity to tokenize a broad range of assets, is anticipated to grow and we may get to see more security token examples in the future. Furthermore, advancements in smart contract technology will make asset ownership and transfer even more efficient. A wider institutional acceptance of blockchain-based securities is expected which might boost traditional financial sectors including private equity, real estate, and banking. Overall, the future of these tokens is heavily dependent on two key factors. One is the extent of advancement in blockchain technology and whether it can handle the risks and capacity of challenges that will arise. And secondly, it is regulatory compliance on a global scale that will make or break the future of these tokens in the real world. In all of this uncertainty, your job is to learn what is a security token and spread awareness about its advantages and risks in your ecosystem which may fuel its adoption significantly.

Gains in the region extended a positive trend set by Wall Street, with tech stocks leading the charge. According to recent news, November US inflation was 2.7%, slightly above the previous month but consistent with market expectations. This figure has prompted economists to forecast a 0.25% rate cut by the Federal Reserve next week. Asian equities have mirrored the rally seen in US markets according to reports . Japan’s Nikkei 225 closed 1.2% higher, supported by its export-heavy composition, while China’s blue-chip CSI 300 index added 1%, surpassing the 4,000-point mark. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng climbed 1.6%, rounding out a day of broad regional gains. Analysts have attributed the uptick to strong performances in US tech stocks, which pushed the Nasdaq 100 up 1.9%. The Nasdaq Composite also broke new ground, closing above 20,000 points for the first time. “The strong reaction in the U.S., especially in tech stocks, has influenced Asian markets,” said Mitul Kotecha, head of emerging markets and macro strategy at Barclays. “The inflation numbers play to a continued easing scenario, which is favorable for markets.” Asian crypto and stock markets rally post-inflation rates announcement Following the news of US inflation rates rising, Asian crypto markets experienced a slight uptick. Ripple (XRP) is up by about 2% since yesterday on the popular South Korean exchange Upbit . At press time, the coin is changing hands at around 3,400 won, up from a 24-hour low of 3,389. Bitcoin (BTC) recovered its $100,000 price level on global exchanges in the late hours of December 11. It also jumped from 142,300,000 won on Upbit and is now hovering around the 143,000,000 won price level, per TradingView data. BTC/KRW price chart. Source: TradingView The largest crypto by market cap, BTC also experienced notable gains in the wake of the US presidential election, climbing 30% in the month following Donald Trump’s victory. This growth far outpaced the 14% increase posted by the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), which tracks Wall Street’s seven largest companies by market capitalization. Asian stocks traded mostly higher on December 12, bolstered by Wall Street’s gains following a US inflation update that reinforced expectations for further Federal Reserve support. Investors in the region welcomed signs of economic resilience and policy adjustments in key markets. According to a Yahoo Finance insight , Chinese equities climbed as leaders met in Beijing to debate economic goals and initiatives for the upcoming year. Among the key announcements was the expansion of trial private pension programs across the country, set to begin on December 15. The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.9% to 3,461.50, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index jumped 1.4% to 20,441.57. South Korea’s Kospi posted a strong performance, advancing 1.6% to 2,482.12. Taiwan’s Taiex followed suit, gaining 0.6%, while Thailand’s SET edged up 0.2%. Meanwhile, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.3% to 8,330.30, and India’s Sensex dipped 0.2%, bucking the broader regional trend. Asia-Pacific leads global crypto adoption Beyond traditional markets, the Asia-Pacific region reaffirmed its leadership in cryptocurrency adoption and innovation. The 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index revealed that Central and Southern Asia and Oceania (CSAO) accounted for seven of the top 20 most active nations in both centralized and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The research also revealed Indonesia as a standout performer, recording over $30 billion (475.13 trillion rupiah) in cryptocurrency transactions between January and October 2024. This marked a staggering 350% growth compared to the same period in 2023, highlighting the region’s growing appetite for digital assets. Asia’s prominence extends beyond adoption, as the continent has become a hub for crypto development. Since 2015, Asia’s share of global cryptocurrency developers has risen from 13% to 32%, surpassing North America, whose share declined from 44% to 25%. Lastly, the ranking of crypto app users in South Korea in November 2024 has been released. Upbit ranked first with 4.36 million users, followed by Bithumb and Pi Network with 2.24 million and 1.34 million users, respectively.

37543498,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=312452,1734007509,"Bitcoin Likely To Print Smaller Gains Compared To Last Market Cycle, According to Analyst Benjamin Cowen","A widely followed crypto analyst says that Bitcoin ( BTC ) is unlikely to print the same gains it did during the last market cycle. In a new strategy session, crypto trader Benjamin Cowen tells his 842,000 YouTube subscribers that the flagship crypto asset’s return on investment (ROI) will likely dip to levels below what it was two cycles ago. “Two cycles ago – so market cycle three – the ROI of Bitcoin at this point in the cycle was, about 5.55x. Right now this cycle, Bitcoin’s ROI as measured from the low is 6.1-7x. Last cycle at this point, the ROI was 9.9x. So you can actually see the ROI is between the last two cycles. It’s kind of fascinating how history has somewhat repeated itself. That doesn’t mean that it’s always going to stay between those two cycles, in fact, at some point the general expectation should be that it would fall below the third cycle’s ROI.” According to Cowen, the crypto king’s returns will stagnate due to its comparatively larger market cap causing diminishing returns. “It’s the same thing as last cycle when everyone was sort of debating diminishing returns and whatnot and whether it would actually follow through to the very end. A lot of people thought it would and you can’t necessarily blame them for thinking that. I mean, at some point the last cycle ROI was even higher than the cycle that came before it, but as we got closer to the end of the cycle, you can see that it did fall short of the prior cycle. I would argue you’ll probably see something similar this time around where it looks like it might track the entire way but at some point, we likely will get some form of diminishing returns. I mean, just to give you an idea, two cycles ago the ROI of Bitcoin from the bottom was a 100x move. The reason why that’s hard to experience in later cycles is because it takes exponentially more money to move the market.” Bitcoin is trading for $101,100 at time of writing, a 1% decrease during the last 24 hours.

37550192,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=104800,1734007074,Here Are Timelines for XRP to Claim $6 and $27 As Per Bifrost Bridge Analysis,"A prominent market analyst presents timelines for XRP to claim new heights, leveraging pointers from his ""Bifrost Bridge"" analysis. The analysis comes on the back of XRP's recent positive performance. The asset surged 283% in November, marking its best monthly performance in seven years. December is continuing this momentum, with XRP gaining an additional 26.4% just 12 days into the month.Market analyst EGRAG has compared the ongoing rally with XRP's trajectory in the 2017 cycle . He suggests that this current price behavior mirrors patterns observed before XRP achieved its all-time high (ATH) of $3.31 in January 2018. Using his ""Bifrost Bridge"" analysis, EGRAG forecasts two potential price milestones for XRP: $6 and $27. Notably, he based these targets on Fibonacci retracement levels and historical price movements.XRP Could Target $6 and $27In his analysis , EGRAG highlighted XRP's early 2017 market moves. For context, in March 2017, XRP rallied 150% from a critical support zone, which the analyst calls the ""purple foundation."" Interestingly, this initial rally set the stage for a more extraordinary 1,330% gain in May 2017. EGRAG projects that XRP's ongoing uptrend could follow a similar trajectory. If the same percentage gains repeat, XRP may achieve new heights.In the current December monthly candle , the analyst believes aims for the ""gold region,"" situated between $4.3 and $6.4. Data from the chart shows that these initial price targets align with Fibonacci retracement levels of 1.414 and 1.618. XRP 1M Chart EGRAG Crypto Meanwhile, for the next monthly candle, January 2025, EGRAG sees a massive 1,330% rally that could push XRP into a second gold region. He expects this gold region to rest between the lofty prices of $13.7 and $27.3, aligning with another retracement zone. EGRAG Dismisses Market Cap SkepticismsNotably, previous skepticism about achieving such targets had emerged. They often center on the increased liquidity and larger market cap in today's crypto markets. However, EGRAG addressed this by comparing the total market caps for 2017 and 2024 (TMC). In May 2017, the crypto market cap stood at $60 billion. Today, it has ballooned to $3.7 trillion, marking a 6,000% increase or a 61x multiple. EGRAG suggests applying this same multiplier to XRP's 2017 market cap of $15 billion. This would result in a hypothetical $900 billion XRP market cap.Interestingly, to contextualize these figures, XRP would need to capture between 9% and 18% of the TMC, depending on whether it grows to $5 trillion or $10 trillion. Given XRP's use cases in cross-border payments, such dominance in market share is considered feasible.For context, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse previously predicted that the TMC could rise to $5 trillion. Today, XRP trades for $2.48, boasting a market cap of $140 billion and 3.96% market dominance. If its dominance reclaimed the 2017 peak of 31%, this would translate to an XRP market cap of over $1 trillion.",POSITIVE,XRP,FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/12/here-are-timelines-for-xrp-to-claim-6-and-27-as-per-bifrost-bridge-analysis/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=here-are-timelines-for-xrp-to-claim-6-and-27-as-per-bifrost-bridge-analysis,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

This hasn’t come as a shock for Avalanche, as the project has struggled to gain momentum this year, though for Ripple, this loss could mark the end of the asset’s wild ride, having rallied last month. Meanwhile, Lunex Network ($LNEX) has been gaining traction in the trading space for its modern approach to crypto. It promises to address long time trader frustrations by offering low fees, strong interoperability, and some powerful trading tools for investors. So how will Avalanche, Ripple, and Lunex Network perform in 2025? Ripple (XRP) Braces For Price Correction Ripple (XRP) is down 6% in the last 24 hours and 7% in the last week, which has got Ripple (XRP) holders concerned about a corrective price action. Many expect corrective price action to arrive as Ripple (XRP) saw some wild growth throughout November, rallying by 300%. This steep increase in Ripple’s value prompted many to believe that it couldn’t last. The growth likely occurred as a result of Trump’s appointment, pointing towards a more favorable regulatory climate for crypto platforms in the near future. Ripple (XRP) has also worked hard to improve its ledger and is now seen as a real authority in the cross-border payment space. Avalanche (AVAX) Introduces Avalanche9000 Avalanche (AVAX) had a weak year overall, adding just 31% to its value, a level of growth dwarfed by the wider crypto market expansion. Avalanche (AVAX) is slowing and possibly heading downward after dropping 12% in 24 hours. Last week, Avalanche (AVAX) also lost 13%. Despite this underwhelming price performance, Avalanche has released some well received updates. Specifically, the Avalanche9000 upgrade, recently released on the testnet, brings flexibility and scalability to the network. It makes Avalanche a more hospitable place for developers looking to build intelligent and scalable decentralized applications. Lunex Network Delivers Extensive Benefits for Traders The advanced offering of Lunex Network ($LNEX) is set to shake up decentralized finance. Its use of the highest tier of smart contract technology lets users swap across over 50,000 assets in real time with low gas fees. For privacy-conscious users, Lunex Network ($LNEX)) removes standard KYC requirements. This appeals to high-profile investors and those who value data protection. Additionally, the platform reduces risks by not requiring third-party wallet connections, ensuring user data remains secure.

Anantha Nageswaran, Chief Economic Advisor to India’s Ministry of Finance, underscored the need to devise regulatory frameworks that will promote innovation in cryptocurrencies while ensuring that the same principles of transparency and accountability are maintained. He said that innovation in the crypto space is a must for progress, but it should not be at the expense of the needs of society . Innovation Should Not Be Stifled Nageswaran emphasized the need for balanced regulation, saying, “Regulators must not stand in the way of so-called innovations in crypto and Bitcoin.” He also pointed out that while innovation is the driver of economic growth, it must be complemented by addressing financial literacy challenges, which remain a big issue in both India and developed nations. The regulations need not be so severe to discourage the growth of technological advances. In that aspect, them can also aim for a leading position in the rapidly changing cryptocurrency business area. Transparency to Regulate The Chief Economic Advisor further elaborated on how transparency should be regarded as a guiding principle. His contention was that, like financial innovations that should conform to social cost-benefit standards, regulators must lead by example themselves. “Regulators should actively share information and ensure their actions align with societal goals,” he said. This approach, he suggested, would help build trust and enable progress in sectors like cryptocurrency while safeguarding public interests. Current Regulatory Landscape in India Nageswaran’s comments come at a time when them crypto market is seeing an increasing demand for regulatory clarity. A policy paper aimed at shedding light on the status of crypto assets has suffered repeated delays as the administration shifts focus to develop and test the digital rupee, CBDC of India. The RBI has taken a cautious stance on cryptocurrencies, flagging risks to financial stability and possible harm to investors . But despite regulatory uncertainty and a steep 30% tax on crypto gains, India has emerged as a global leader in crypto adoption, ranking first in Chainalysis’s latest Global Crypto Adoption Index. A Promising Future Amid Challenges India’s crypto sector continues to reach key milestones. Recently, Jetking Infotrain became the first publicly listed Indian company to add Bitcoin to its corporate treasury. Such development mirrors the resilience and potential of the sector amid a testing regulatory environment. With the right mix of innovation and accountability, experts say India can unlock the full potential of cryptocurrencies.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/indias-chief-economic-advisor-regulation-encourages/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trumps-tariffs-trumptar-memecoin-will-explode-over-16000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37547430,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/nvidia-faces-renewed-legal-battle-as-supreme-court-dismisses-appeal,1734006829,Nvidia Faces Renewed Legal Battle as Supreme Court Dismisses Appeal,"The U.S. Supreme Court has declined Nvidia's appeal to dismiss a class-action lawsuit alleging the company misled investors about its reliance on cryptocurrency mining for GPU sales. The decision, delivered in a one-line order without explanation on December 11, reinstates the case after it was previously dismissed by a California district court in 2021. Lawsuit Origins and Allegations The case stems from a 2018 lawsuit filed by a Swedish investment firm following a steep decline in Nvidia’s stock value, which dropped 28% as cryptocurrency profitability plummeted. Plaintiffs claim Nvidia misrepresented the extent to which cryptocurrency mining drove its revenue, asserting the company marketed its GPUs as gaming-focused while a substantial portion of sales was linked to the volatile crypto-mining market. Investors allege these misrepresentations inflated Nvidia’s stock price, which subsequently fell short of expectations when the crypto market cooled. The lawsuit argues that Nvidia knowingly obscured its dependence on cryptocurrency sales to protect its valuation. Legal Challenges and Supreme Court Decision Nvidia sought to have the case dismissed under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which aims to deter baseless securities claims. The company argued the plaintiffs failed to identify specific false statements or provide sufficient evidence that company officials knowingly misled investors. While a district court initially dismissed the case in March 2021, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals later reinstated it. The Biden administration supported the plaintiffs, adding weight to the case. On December 11, the Supreme Court dismissed Nvidia’s appeal as ""improvidently granted,"" effectively upholding the appellate court’s decision. Nvidia's Response An Nvidia spokesperson expressed disappointment in the Supreme Court’s decision, stating: ""We would have preferred a decision on the merits affirming the trial court’s dismissal of the case, but we are fully prepared to continue our defense. Consistent and predictable standards in securities litigation are essential to protecting shareholders and ensuring a strong economy, and we remain committed to supporting them."" Regulatory Concerns in the U.S. and China The Supreme Court’s decision coincides with increasing scrutiny of Nvidia's business practices. In 2022, Nvidia settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), paying a $5.5 million fine over similar allegations of failing to disclose its reliance on cryptocurrency mining for revenue. Adding to its legal troubles, Chinese regulators recently launched an antitrust investigation into Nvidia, targeting its dominant position in the artificial intelligence chip market. Despite these challenges, Nvidia’s stock has surged 180% this year due to increasing demand for AI-related technologies. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Avalanche and Solana, two giants in the Layer 1 blockchain space, are buzzing with activity. Avalanche’s much-anticipated Etna upgrade is around the corner, poised to supercharge the network’s capabilities. Meanwhile, Solana is navigating market ripples, holding firm amidst ecosystem challenges. But there’s a surprising contender in the spotlight: Rollblock, a Web3 casino platform, with predictions of eye-popping 50x returns. Amidst these updates, Qubetics is it making waves in the presale market. Qubetics: Revolutionising Blockchain with Real-World Solutions Unlike its predecessors, Qubetics ($TICS) doesn’t just promise innovation—it delivers. While Avalanche and Solana have tackled speed and scalability, Qubetics is here to address real-world problems with its revolutionary QubeQode IDE for savvy developers . The platform’s presale success is a testament to its game-changing potential. Qubetics is currently in its 12th presale stage; Qubetics has sold over 305 million $TICS tokens to 8,400+ holders, raising a whopping $5.5 million. The frenzy is real at just $0.0311 per token, with a 10% price jump slated for the weekend. But what sets Qubetics apart from Avalanche and Solana? The secret sauce lies in its innovative solutions. Take the QubeQode IDE , for instance. It’s not just a tool; it’s a paradigm shift. Imagine you’re a developer working on a healthcare app. With QubeQode, you can integrate blockchain features like patient data security in hours, not weeks. Or picture a small business owner wanting to streamline payments—QubeQode makes it seamless, even for tech novices. Qubetics isn’t just another blockchain project; it’s a revolution in how we interact with technology. The presale’s runaway success underscores its massive potential. If you’re serious about finding the best altcoins to buy now for massive gains, $TICS should be at the top of your list. But act fast—opportunities like this don’t linger. Avalanche: Charging Ahead with the Etna Upgrade Avalanche has been on a tear recently, climbing to $49.5 and teasing a rally past the crucial $50 resistance. The buzz? It’s all about the upcoming Etna upgrade. Set to go live on December 16, Etna is touted as the biggest leap forward for Avalanche since its inception in 2020. With on-chain activity spiking by 13% and trading volume hitting $2.6 billion, this upgrade promises to strengthen Avalanche’s scalability and enhance its dApp ecosystem. What makes Avalanche one of the best altcoins to buy now for massive gains? Well, the platform is tailor-made for developers craving speed and security. Its subnets architecture is a masterstroke, enabling developers to spin up bespoke blockchains without worrying about congesting the main network. Imagine hosting an e-commerce store during Black Friday—Avalanche’s tech ensures smooth sailing, no matter the traffic. But it’s not all roses. Whales’ selling pressure of around $53.8 shows the market’s fickle nature. Yet, analysts believe flipping $50 into a support level could push Avalanche to yearly highs of $65 in Q1 2025. With the Etna upgrade on the horizon, Avalanche’s ecosystem is primed to surge. Avalanche might be your golden ticket if you’re hunting for the best altcoins to buy now for massive gains. Solana: Resilient in the Face of Turbulence Solana’s journey in 2024 has been anything but dull. The network’s current price of $218, down slightly by 3.2%, reflects a momentary dip amidst broader gains. Over the past month, Solana still boasts a solid 15% uptick, proving its resilience in a volatile market. So, what’s causing today’s wobble? The Pump.Fun debacle. The popular launchpad’s decision to pause live-streaming features following controversial meme coin launches sent shockwaves through the ecosystem. Even so, Solana’s strengths remain undeniable. Its unmatched speed and near-zero fees make it a darling for developers. Think of Solana as the Tesla of blockchains—fast, efficient, and always ahead of the curve. Projects like Magic Eden and Audius thrive here, proof of Solana’s ability to foster real-world utility. What’s next for Solana? Market watchers are eyeing the $200 support level. If Solana bounces back with strong ecosystem growth, it could cement its status as one of the best altcoins to buy now for massive gains. Solana isn’t just a blockchain; it’s a statement of intent in a rapidly evolving Web3 landscape. If you’re into crypto for the long haul, this powerhouse might be your next big move. Seize Your Moment So, what’s the takeaway? Whether it’s Avalanche’s trailblazing upgrades, Solana’s steadfast innovation, or Qubetics’ groundbreaking real-world solutions, these altcoins are primed for explosive growth. The market’s buzzing, and the time to act is now. Don’t sit on the sidelines while others ride the wave of massive gains. Dive in, do your research, and make your move. Ready to join the crypto revolution? Start with Qubetics. With its top crypto presale booming and innovative tech stack, it’s more than just an investment; it’s a stake in the future.

Meanwhile, Binance Coin (BNB) reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $793, reflecting strong investor demand. Additionally, Yeti Ouro (YETIO), a new altcoin project, has raised over $1 million in its presale, gaining traction among investors and gamers. SOL experiences market dip amid broader activity Solana (SOL) dipped to $204, then rose up to $227 later in the day. However, there has been a slight drop in Solana in the past few days, though in the past year, it has been performing impressively with its price rising by 218%. Some of the analysts have set the price target of SOL price at $4,000 for the near future, assuming that the current positive trend remains intact. A crypto trading expert recently posted a chart of a “cup and handle” pattern on the monthly chart on the X platform. This pattern usually points to a major break out in technical analysis. Source: X The analyst sees a potential for a breakout above the $260 level to higher Fibonacci extension levels with targets at $2236 and $4013. This prediction shows that the current levels can expand up to 1,861%. Binance surges to $793 ATH amid bullish momentum Binance Coin has climbed to an all-time high of $793, marking a major milestone for the cryptocurrency. This surge follows the overall market’s positive trend, particularly due to Bitcoin’s jump to over $100,000. Despite the BNB price correction that has seen the token lose 13% of its value from its previous all-time high, the token is still trading strongly above major support. Source: X Using the technical approach, BNB has the potential to keep on going up. Potential targets are at $886 and $1,036 based on the Fibonacci extension levels and the MACD presents the bullish momentum. If markets keep on improving, BNB may have the potential to attain new price levels within the next few months. Yeti Ouro raises $1 million in stage 1 of its presale Yeti Ouro, an emerging utility-driven meme coin, is the latest entrant to the cryptoverse and has raised over $1 million in its first presale stage. This presale has already sold 85.2% of its allocated tokens, and 15% are still available before the price rise. Yeti Ouro is based on the Ethereum blockchain and is connected to Yeti Go, a P2E racing arcade game designed using Unreal Engine. The token offers practical use while tapping into the meme craze which is good for both gamers and investors. It also has staking rewards, a burn mechanism that takes 5% of the mining rewards, and 1 billion tokens in the supply to help build the scarcity model for the future. The quick achievement in the fundraising also indicates that more and more people have faith in the project. At the present phase, early investors are seizing the opportunity to invest at a low price of $0.012 per token. With each stage of presale tokens sold, the price will likely increase in the following stages. To learn more about Yeti Ouro community, visit the website , X , Telegram , and Discord.

On Dec. 12, local news agency Sina Finance reported that many mainland users saw promotional ads for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on their Alipay homepages. The ad encouraged crypto investments, stating: “Global investment, cryptocurrency soaring, 10 yuan minimum investment, get on board now.” The promotion referred users to Huabao Overseas Technology C (QDII-FOF-LOF), which allegedly has indirect exposure to Coinbase stock and the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF. $140 Daily Purchase Limit Colin Wu, a well-known market observer, noted on X that mainland users are limited to a daily purchase of 1,000 Chinese yuan ($137) of the fund’s shares, with a minimum investment of 10 yuan ($1.40). “It indirectly invested in Coinbase stock and ARK spot Bitcoin ETF by investing in Wood Sister’s fund.

According to the Financial Review, Australian company AMP, which manages $56 billion, announced that it purchased $27 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) through its pension fund. AMP has become the first major Australian superannuation fund to invest in BTC, despite major fund managers in the $4 trillion superannuation savings sector previously rejecting Bitcoin investments due to its volatility. AMP senior portfolio manager Steve Flegg said in a statement that Bitcoin has grown so much that its potential is now too great to ignore. Stuart Eliot, Head of AMP Portfolio Management, said: “The company decided to add a small, risk-controlled position in digital assets under its Dynamic Asset Allocation program earlier this year after careful consideration and testing by our investment team and committee. “We have decided to allocate approximately 0.05% of our total retirement assets under management for Bitcoin allocation.” Following this decision, other major Australian funds stated that they do not plan to invest in BTC or other cryptocurrencies. This decision was not surprising as Central Bank Governor Michele Bullock had previously stated that Bitcoin had no place in the Australian economy and that it had no place in retirement portfolios because it did not provide returns. *This is not investment advice.

37543265,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626445,1734006455,Russia taps BRICS partners for collaborative AI development projects,"Russia is pushing for a major comeback in the global tech race, leaning on its BRICS+ partners to build a united front in artificial intelligence (AI) development. President Vladimir Putin, speaking at Moscow’s flagship AI conference , announced the formation of the AI Alliance Network. The initiative will connect national AI associations and development institutions from BRICS nations and other countries like Indonesia and Serbia. This decision is all about challenging US dominance in one of the 21st century’s most critical technologies. “Russia must participate on equal terms in the global race to create strong artificial intelligence,” Putin declared. He called on scientists worldwide to join the collaboration, pitching the alliance as a global platform for AI innovation and regulation. The AI struggle under Western sanctions Western sanctions have targeted Russia’s access to advanced technologies, especially GPUs—the essential microchips powering AI. As part of the coordinated action, major chip manufacturers have cut off exports to Russia, stifling its tech growth. Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender and AI pioneer is leading the charge to overcome these obstacles. Its CEO, German Gref, acknowledged in 2023 that GPUs were the hardest hardware to replace, underscoring a key bottleneck in Russia’s AI aspirations. Sberbank’s own generative AI model, GigaChat, and Yandex’s YandexGPT are examples of domestic innovation, but the lack of cutting-edge hardware has slowed their progress. Despite these challenges, the newly formed AI Alliance Network is pulling together AI associations from BRICS and non-BRICS countries to share resources, conduct joint research, and create AI regulatory frameworks. Sberbank announced that the network will also open new markets for AI products within member countries. Global AI race heats up The United States and China remain the dominant players in AI, with President-elect Donald Trump doubling down on America’s tech supremacy. Trump recently introduced a “White House AI and Crypto Czar” to keep the US ahead of the curve, while warning BRICS countries not to create a currency alternative to the dollar. He even threatened 100% tariffs if they did. Putin’s pivot to China is a strategic response. Russia has developed its own generative AI models, making it one of 10 countries (including the US, China, Britain, and Israel) actively competing in the field. Moscow-based consultancy Yakov and Partners, run by former McKinsey employees, believes Russia could grow into a much bigger AI player, despite its current ranking of 31st on the Global AI Index by Tortoise Media. Economic projections further fuel Russia’s motivation. The government estimates AI could add 11.2 trillion roubles ($109 billion) to the GDP by 2030, a massive leap from 0.2 trillion roubles ($1.9 billion) in 2023. The AI strategy also reportedly wants to upskill 80% of the workforce with AI knowledge by 2030, compared to just 5% today. Investment in AI is expected to rise sevenfold, hitting 850 billion roubles. The currency question within BRICS While AI collaboration thrives, discussions about a unified BRICS currency remain in limbo. Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das confirmed that no decision has been made to challenge the dollar with a BRICS currency. “The geographical spread of the countries has to be kept in mind,” he said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is encouraging the use of the rupee for cross-border payments, positioning India as a manufacturing alternative to China post-COVID. This aligns with the BRICS’ broader goals but hasn’t yet resulted in a formal plan. Trump’s administration is closely watching these developments. Alongside his AI initiatives, Trump extended a high-profile invitation to Chinese President Xi Jinping to attend his upcoming inauguration. While Xi has not yet confirmed, Trump’s team is also courting other leaders, including Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. But perhaps inviting Putin would be opening a Pandora’s box the US president doesn’t think is worth it after all.

Analyst Coinvo sees a head-and-shoulders pattern for ETH while DOGE is on the path of an upward trend, so their futures appear bright. However, a new coin is also turning some heads with its growth: IntelMarkets (INTL) . In phase seven of its presale, this altcoin has already soared by 610%, and more price spikes are expected. Some experts even think a 5x growth could be in store for INTL in 2025, as it will tap into the growing AI market. Coinvo: The Price of Ethereum (ETH) May Rise Soon Recently, market expert Coinvo made headlines with his Ethereum (ETH) statement. According to a recent X post by him, this top 5 cryptocurrency is forming a potential head-and-shoulders pattern. This could lead to a potential spike to $4,200, as per his Ethereum price prediction. The Ethereum price has jumped nearly 20% in the past 30 days. CoinMarketCap shows that Ethereum (ETH) traded between $3,100 and $3,700 in that period. The technicals for the Ethereum coin are also bullish at the moment. TradingView points to this altcoin trading above its 30-day EMA ($3,502) and 50-day EMA ($3,297). Moreover, its momentum indicator sits at 17, which is in the buy zone and suggests further growth. The Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Could See an Uptrend Dogecoin (DOGE) is another crypto coin showing some green price charts. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade said it has seen a breakout from a descending trendline. According to his X post, this could kickstart a new uptrend for this meme coin. This Dogecoin price prediction has excited many traders. Meanwhile, CoinMarketCap data shows that this meme coin has surged nearly 40% in the past month alone. In that period, the Dogecoin price fluctuated between nearly $0.30 and over $0.40. TradingView data also shows some bullish signs for the Dogecoin crypto. Currently, Dogecoin (DOGE) is trading above its 50-day EMA ($0.33) and its 100-day EMA ($0.26). Additionally, its bull-bear power sits at -0.05, suggesting that bulls could push their value up. IntelMarkets (INTL) Sees a 610% Growth, Igniting FOMO The crypto space is taking note of IntelMarkets (INTL) after it experienced a 610% price surge in its ongoing presale. Since this crypto ICO event is in phase seven, more price jumps will come as it advances. Because of this, millions of traders are stocking up on this altcoin before its price skyrockets. IntelMarkets is gaining traction because of many reasons: AI-Powered Smart Trading Platform: IntelMarkets will combine AI tech with blockchain, offering traders self-learning trading robots, autopilot bots, and more. Holding Benefits: INTL token holders will receive governance voting rights, first access to new IntelMarkets features, and up to 30% discounts on trading fees. Long-Term Stability: Statista predicts the AI market will be worth $826B by 2030, potentially giving INTL long-term stability and great growth potential. Currently, one INTL costs only $0.064 in phase seven of its presale, a 610% rise from its starting price. However, phase eight will bring another jump to $0.073. Not only that, a Tier-1 CEX listing is expected to bring the price of INTL to $0.11 – a 71% increase from its current price. This could make INTL one of the altcoins to watch for big returns. Can IntelMarkets (INTL) Steal the Spotlight Like Ethereum (ETH) & Dogecoin (DOGE)? While Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE), two top altcoins, may see big price gains soon, IntelMarkets (INTL) may also make some noise . This rookie will have a smaller market cap than its peers, which means faster price growth with less money. Therefore, many experts think a 5x growth could be in store for INTL in 2025.

The airdrop will target users who have delegated SOL or eligible Liquid Staking Tokens ( LSTs ) to Sonic AVS via Solayer. All qualifying delegations — including not only SOL stakers, but also users of Solayer-powered protocols such as Adrastea — will be captured in a snapshot occurring ahead of Sonic’s Token Generation Event (TGE) scheduled for Q1 2025. Chris Zhu, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) at Sonic, emphasized the significance of the airdrop, saying: “The airdrop confirmation signals our commitment to empowering those who have played a pivotal role in the growth of Sonic’s AVS. By rewarding Solayer delegators and Adrastea participants, we’re not only incentivizing broader participation but also ensuring that the users who have believed in Sonic’s vision from the start benefit directly from our growth.” New Sonic SVM airdrop Currently the largest delegated AVS on Solayer, Sonic holds over $80 million in SOL, with over 81,000 delegators. The airdrop is, therefore, a way for Sonic to show appreciation for early adopters and highlight the importance of community participation in Solana’s restaking space. Users who delegate to Sonic AVS via Solayer also gain access to LSTs, which allow for greater liquidity through integrations with decentralized finance ( DeFi ) platforms like Banx, Orca, and Meteora. Additional liquidity further unlocks new opportunities for restakers and helps secure TVL for Sonic’s AVS. The growth of Solana’s liquid staking market Solana’s liquid staking market is experiencing rapid growth, with the total market capitalization of LSTs surpassing $2 billion. Initiatives like the upcoming Sonic airdrop are thus helping the platform drive adoption and further energize its restaking platform. By simplifying the staking process for Solayer delegators, Sonic is helping users track their contributions and get rewarded for them.

37544948,https://cryptonews.com/?p=318989,1734006068,AMP Becomes First Super Fund to Allocate Part of its Portfolio to Crypto,"AMP, one of Australia’s leading superannuation funds, has allocated $27 million of its portfolio to Bitcoin, making it the first major super fund in the $4 trillion retirement savings sector to embrace the often-volatile cryptocurrency market. AMP’s move into the digital asset sector comes despite the critical views from several quarters, including the Reserve Bank of Australia’s Governor Michele Bullock, who believes cryptocurrency lacks a rightful place in the Australian economy. In an interview with the Australian Financial Review , AMP’s Chief Investment Officer, Anna Shelley, said that the Bitcoin purchase represents 0.05% of AMP’s impressive $57 billion under management. AMP Adopts Bitcoin for Diversification Shelley attributed the move to a diversification strategy informed by AMP’s dynamic asset allocation process, which recognized Bitcoin’s significant momentum and sentiment in the market. The pivot comes amid Bitcoin’s recent surge past the $100,000 mark, bolstered by a market bull run following Donald Trump’s re-election and his administration’s crypto-friendly stance. Steve Flegg, AMP’s Senior Portfolio Manager, shared on LinkedIn that the fund had “taken the plunge,” citing the cryptocurrency’s growth and potential as too significant to overlook despite its risks. The move has stirred varied reactions within the industry. While AustralianSuper disclosed its focus on blockchain technology and indirect investments in companies leveraging this technology, it confirmed no current plans to directly invest in cryptocurrencies. Similarly, representatives from Australian Retirement Trust and retail super giant MLC have shown cautious interest but no immediate plans to follow in AMP’s footsteps, per the AFR report. AMP claimed that its crypto venture remains within conservative risk boundaries.

At the customer level, those with investments in AMP’s balanced and growth options are likely to see the most exposure to Bitcoin. While conservative funds may have minimal allocations, the potential benefits could be significant, notwithstanding the acknowledged risks and volatility associated with cryptocurrencies.

The decision , delivered on Dec. 12 by Justice John Nicholas, sided with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), which accused Bit Trade of failing to comply with design and distribution obligations and acting as an unlicensed credit facility. Justice Nicholas deemed the penalty appropriate, falling between ASIC’s request for AU$12.8 million and Bit Trade’s argument for a reduced fine of AU$2.5 million. The company must pay the fine within 60 days and cover court costs. Kraken expressed disappointment with the ruling, stating, “We believe this case underscores the urgent need for tailored crypto legislation to provide clarity for Australian investors and businesses. These rulings, in our view, hinder the growth of Australia’s economy.” Australia Targets Misleading Practices ASIC’s case focused on Bit Trade’s offering of a “margin extension” product that allowed leveraged trading without a legally required target market determination (TMD). The court noted that over 1,100 Australians used the product, incurring $7 million in fees and interest, with losses exceeding $5 million. One investor reportedly lost nearly $4 million. ASIC Chair Joe Longo emphasized the importance of the ruling, describing it as a landmark penalty for failing to provide a TMD. “Target market determinations are essential for preventing the inappropriate marketing of high-risk products to consumers,” Longo stated . The court criticized Bit Trade’s actions, finding the company acted to maximize revenue without due regard for Australian corporate law until ASIC’s intervention. Justice Nicholas noted that even after becoming aware of regulatory requirements, the company continued to offer the product to retail clients, compounding its violations. A Wake-Up Call for the Crypto Industry This ruling comes amid heightened regulatory scrutiny on the crypto sector in Australia . ASIC has signaled its intention to hold digital asset firms accountable under existing laws, emphasizing that crypto products must be appropriately designed and marketed to protect consumers. Longo warned, “Many products offered by crypto companies are already subject to current laws. Firms must prioritize compliance to avoid such penalties.” The post Kraken Australia Fined $5.1M for Regulatory Breaches Amid ASIC Crackdown appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,The Coin Rise,https://thecoinrise.com/kraken-australia-fined-5-1m-for-regulatory-breaches-amid-asic-crackdown/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/37542694.jpeg

37542501,https://nulltx.com/?p=135599,1734005464,Breaking Bitcoin News: Bitcoin Reserve Plan Rejected by Microsoft While Whales Scoop Up JetBolt Tokens,"All eyes are on Bitcoin (BTC) and the young altcoin JetBolt (JBOLT) with the recent developments surrounding these two cryptocurrencies. This week, market watchers and enthusiasts were taken aback when Microsoft’s board firmly rejected the Bitcoin reserve proposal. Following this news about Microsoft’s “no” to the crypto giant’s proposal, the price of Bitcoin showed slight fluctuations. Meanwhile, as Bitcoin faces this roadblock, JetBolt captures the interest of blockchain whales and buyers for its recent milestone. The young presale coin JetBolt has sold over 150 million tokens since its debut. Is there a secret sauce in JetBolt’s growing popularity and rising token sales? And what’s next for Bitcoin after stumbling on Microsoft’s rejection? Read on to find out. What’s Next for BTC After Microsoft Turns Its Back on Bitcoin Reserve Proposal? Microsoft shareholders voted against a proposal to channel part of the company’s profits into investing in Bitcoin during a meeting on December 10. The said proposal was introduced by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), an institution that supports free-market policy. The organization proposed that Microsoft invest between 1% and 5% of its revenues in Bitcoin (BTC). Before the voting, Bitcoin supporter and MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor said Bitcoin could help add an astounding $5 trillion value to Microsoft. However, the tech company decisively opposed the proposal, citing the intrinsic volatility of crypto assets like BTC and emphasizing that such an investment does not align with the company’s strategic objectives. Bitcoin’s 7-day price chart on CoinMarketCap shows BTC price plummeted to $94,000 before stabilizing at its current price of around $100,000 Microsoft’s decision to turn down the reserve proposal mirrors the stance of the company’s co-founder Bill Gates on crypto assets. Back in June 2022, Gates criticized the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies at a conference. Following the news about Microsoft’s dismissal of the proposal, BTC dropped to around $94K on December 11 but has recovered and reclaimed six figures with its press time price at approximately $100K. JetBolt (JBOLT) Soars as Crypto Whales Accumulate More Tokens While Bitcoin’s price reacted negatively to this week’s development, young altcoin JetBolt (JBOLT) is also turning heads because of its explosive presale momentum. With over 150 million tokens sold since its presale began, it’s no surprise that JetBolt is becoming the talk of the town. Zooming into JetBolt, this blazing newcomer is more than just its skyrocketing presale figures; it offers features that could magnetize blockchain whales and buyers. At the center of JetBolt’s game-changing features is zero-gas technology, which is deemed beneficial for users who make frequent crypto transactions. Through zero-gas technology, users no longer have to be inconvenienced by paying hefty gas fees for their blockchain transactions. But zero-gas technology not only helps users—it could also empower developers. With this high-tech feature, they can easily build a wide range of innovative and useful blockchain applications without paying costly gas fees. Beyond the seamless and gas-free transactions, JetBolt offers crypto users and developers, this next-gen altcoin also injects fun and excitement into otherwise serious and intimidating crypto-staking activity. Stakers can potentially earn bonus rewards when they connect with friends on JetBolt’s crypto beginner-friendly staking platform. That’s not all. Exciting early-bird advantages are another potential reason blockchain whales and crypto buyers eagerly jump to scoop up JetBolt (JBOLT) tokens. Early purchasers can enjoy as much as 25% extra tokens when they avail themselves of Alpha Boxes or tokens in batches. JetBolt’s soaring presale token sales, innovative features, and presale perks make it one of the noteworthy rising stars in the Web3 space today. Conclusion — Bitcoin Reserve Plan Rejection and JetBolt’s Presale Momentum Microsoft’s decision to reject the Bitcoin reserve plan reflects the cautious reality of mainstream adoption. However, despite this setback on potential corporate adoption, Bitcoin still dominates as the largest crypto asset based on market capitalization. Meanwhile, JetBolt’s astonishing presale signals the increasing interest in fresh tokens championing real innovation. As whales and buyers flock to JetBolt, the stage is set for this young crypto’s thrilling chapter. Discover more about JetBolt’s exciting features and ongoing presale.

Key metrics such as DEX volume jumping to above $900 billion, traders hitting 383 million and swaps reaching 4.56 billion are buoying projections. Aave (AAVE) Arthur Cheong, founder and CIO of crypto investment firm DeFiance Capital, predicts Aave could go higher given bullish network metrics. “Protocol metrics of Aave already exceed ATH by a wide margin but the price is still >50% below ATH. Stablecoin supply is also significantly higher compared to 2021 which powers DeFi. Higher,” Cheong posted on X. AAVE hovered around $362, its highest level since September 2021.

37542355,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392324,1734005227,Altcoin Season: Time to Bet on Blockchain Gaming? Analyst Says Yes,"The post Altcoin Season: Time to Bet on Blockchain Gaming? Analyst Says Yes appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Blockchain gaming is emerging as a major force in the crypto world, and analyst VirtualBacon believes the sector is still greatly undervalued. While categories like Layer-1 blockchains, AI, and meme coins have seen strong growth, gaming tokens only make up 0.4% of market dominance in the current bear market. VirtualBacon sees this as a huge opportunity for investors, especially as altcoin season heats up and gaming tokens could potentially triple their market dominance during the next bull run. Is the Gaming Sector Lagging? In his recent analysis, VirtualBacon noted that while Layer-1 blockchains have seen their dominance grow from 5% to 9%, and AI has surged from 0.6% to 1.2%, the gaming sector has not experienced similar growth. However, the market capitalization of gaming altcoins has crossed the $32.2 billion mark, showing a renewed interest in Web3 gaming. This sets the stage for significant growth in the gaming sector as attention shifts to blockchain-based gaming experiences. Top Gaming Tokens for a 3X Surge VirtualBacon has made gaming tokens his largest portfolio allocation, now at 14%. He believes several projects have strong potential for growth: SuperVerse (SUPER) Starting with the standout performer, SUPER has risen from $0.20 to $2.20 since November 2023. It has consistently outperformed Bitcoin, forming higher lows on the BTC ratio chart. Staking initiatives and the TON Station airdrop are credited with fueling its rise. The main reason for this uptrend is that altcoins are not releasing a large amount of supply to the market for early investors in the bare market, diluting supply and adding to sell pressure. BEAM Beam is rising against Bitcoin due to its major upgrades and strategic moves. It shifted from a smaller network to its high-performance blockchain, making it a stronger contender in gaming tech. Plus, its expansion into the UAE, a crypto hotspot, brings fresh opportunities and funding. These advancements have boosted confidence in Beam, reflected in its steady growth against BTC. Other Promising Tokens Wild (WILD): Known for its innovative approach, Wild is making waves by blending utility with entertainment in new ways. SeedWorld (SWORLD) and Xborg (XBG): These projects are breaking new ground by combining immersive experiences with decentralized finance, pushing blockchain gaming to new heights. Plus Play Network (PLAY) and Super Champs (CHAMP): Focused on fresh narratives and engaging gameplay, these projects aim to redefine the sector and move past the declining popularity of play-to-earn models. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Are Defying Trading Volume Slumps , The Decline of Older Gaming Tokens While newer projects gain traction, older gaming tokens like Sandbox , Decentraland , and Axie Infinity are struggling to regain their previous momentum. The fading interest in play-to-earn and metaverse narratives has left these projects behind, opening up space for new, innovative players to lead the market. Current Market Sentiment VirtualBacon sees blockchain gaming aligning well with broader market trends indicating an altcoin season. The Altcoin Season Index has surpassed the crucial 75% threshold, a level that has historically signaled market rallies. As Bitcoin pushes past $100,000 and altcoins begin to outperform, gaming tokens could see substantial inflows. This makes blockchain gaming a sector with huge potential, offering investors high rewards as new projects move beyond outdated models. With innovative new projects on the rise in 2025, blockchain gaming is poised to be a key area for investors to focus on in the coming months. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37542417,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626450,1734005227,Whales buy into Chainlink as LINK token rallies closer to $30,"Chainlink (LINK) is revisiting price levels not seen since 2021 as the token inches closer to the $30 mark. Recent on-chain analysis shows increasing whale activity with large wallets getting in at this price level. Chainlink (LINK) has become attractive to whale buyers as seen on recent on-chain data. In one transaction, a large-scale buyer acquired $4.94M of LINK tokens, at an average price of $28.18. The funds went through an intermediary wallet before landing in a high-balance holder’s wallet that has been active since November. LINK is now returning to levels not seen since 2021. The token has a unique trajectory, peaking in late 2020 at above $49. Since then, LINK has served as a utility token and has often gone counter to the market. In late 2024, LINK rallied along with other “dinosaur coins” after the launch of a brief altcoin season. LINK has always had a community of long-term holders, which has set up expectations for new all-time highs. LINK is one of the few tokens with both a strong appeal as a community and utility through its oracle services. The company continues to expand its portfolio of projects, setting up data for crypto insiders and a selection of TradFi clients. Chainlink secures data for 407 crypto entities, securing $38.33B in value. LINK is closely watched for its potential to chart at new highs toward the end of 2024 as it inches closer to new all-time highs. As of December 12, open interest for LINK grew to an all-time high above $656M, with constant growth in the past few days. LINK retains 70% of long positions against an average of 30% for shorts on most leading crypto exchanges. The recent rise of LINK is also connected to Bybit’s recent breakout. Most LINK volumes have now moved to the rising exchange, with $341.7M in open interest on that market. LINK is also riding additional hype as it already climbed into the top 15 of coins and tokens by market capitalization. Chainlink gains from oracle service partnerships The recent rally is also in response to news that Donald Trump’s DeFi venture, World Liberty Financial, is acquiring LINK tokens for its portfolio. World Liberty also acquired ETH and AAVE as part of its attempts to build a DeFi vault. World Liberty holds $1.15M worth of LINK or 41.33K tokens on a widely known public wallet . World Liberty buys LINK as part of its partnership in using oracle services, going beyond short-term speculation. Chainlink has different appeal points in its relationshipe with its community and real-world financial entities. Recently, Chainlink became a part of the Digital Asset Board with Emirates NBD. Chainlink will add its expertise to already established board members PwC, Fireblocks, R3 and Chainalysis. The company with $260B in assets under management will explore Chainlink’s services for increased efficiency. Chainlink continues to test its digital data services and oracle connections to make traditional business processes more efficient. Chainlink gets boost from cross-chain transfers Chainlink’s main product in addition to its oracle services is the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). The protocol’s key asset is Circle’s USDC, considered a fully regulated and transparent asset. Chainlink’s CCIP carries mostly USDC and GHO as part of the Aave and other DeFi ecosystems. | Source: Dune Analytics More than 90% of the CCIP volumes are for stablecoins, one of the key growth areas of crypto usage. The two most common multi-chain transfers are for USDC and Aave’s GHO stablecoin. Chainlink is one of the main facilitators of the Aave lending vault ecosystem on multiple chains. CCIP also spread to the Ronin Network , one of the growing platforms for Web3 and gaming. Ronin’s community voted to migrate its cross-chain activity to CCIP and replace its current bridges. The Ronin Network was extremely successful but suffered a setback after one of its main bridges was hacked for upward of $600M.

37542225,https://crypto.news/?p=14318401,1734004980,El Salvador and Bhutan: Betting on Bitcoin’s future | Opinion,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. Two small nations, El Salvador and Bhutan , have made bold moves into the Bitcoin ( BTC ) arena, which showcase how cryptocurrency can redefine economic strategies for countries with ambitious leadership and limited resources. Bhutan, through its sovereign investment arm, has amassed Bitcoin holdings worth over $1 billion—more than one-third of its GDP—while El Salvador’s reserves stand at approximately 6,150 Bitcoin, valued at over $550 million. These investments are declarations of faith in Bitcoin’s long-term potential to drive economic transformation and resilience. You might also like: Bhutan’s path to economic self-reliance is Bitcoin mining | Opinion Under the visionary leadership of President Nayib Bukele, El Salvador has become a symbol of crypto innovation. Since adopting Bitcoin as a legal tender in 2021, the nation has gained significant global attention and demonstrated the viability of cryptocurrency as a tool for financial inclusion, foreign investment, and economic growth. Bhutan, on the other hand, has taken a more calculated approach—leveraging its abundant hydropower resources to establish itself as a sustainable Bitcoin mining hub. Together, these nations highlight the opportunities Bitcoin offers to those willing to embrace its volatility and bet on its upward trajectory. El Salvador: A beacon of Bitcoin-powered growth El Salvador’s Bitcoin experiment has been a cornerstone of President Bukele’s sweeping fiscal and economic reforms. From creating the world’s first legal framework for Bitcoin to launching plans for a tax-free Bitcoin City powered by geothermal energy and funded by $1 billion “Volcano Bonds,” the nation has positioned itself as a crypto trailblazer. These bold initiatives are visionary and rooted in tangible outcomes: El Salvador’s GDP grew by 19% between 2021 and 2023, while its debt-to-GDP ratio dropped from 95% in 2020 to 59% in 2024. Bitcoin has also transformed the remittance sector, a lifeline for millions of Salvadorans living abroad. The state enabled direct Bitcoin transfers, cutting out traditional intermediaries, lowering fees, and making transactions faster and more accessible. This move alone has saved millions in fees and reinforced Bitcoin’s potential to empower everyday users. Beyond remittances, El Salvador has witnessed a surge in foreign investment and tourism as crypto enthusiasts and digital nomads flock to the country. Casinos and restaurants increasingly accept Bitcoin as payment, reflecting growing confidence in cryptocurrency’s role in the nation’s economy. While adoption among citizens remains a work in progress, Bitcoin’s rising value has already bolstered the nation’s treasury, proving its worth as a store of value. Bhutan: Mining Bitcoin for sustainable growth Bhutan’s approach to Bitcoin has been more methodical and strategic and is focused on mining rather than adoption as a currency. Utilizing its vast renewable hydropower resources, Bhutan has built one of the most efficient Bitcoin mining operations in the world. Druk Holding & Investments, the country’s sovereign fund, has turned Bitcoin into a profitable national asset, with holdings exceeding $1 billion. Mining Bitcoin with renewable energy both makes Bhutan a model of sustainability and underscores its ability to capitalize on its unique geographical advantages. Such an approach shows how small nations can leverage cryptocurrency in ways tailored to their strengths, creating new revenue streams while minimizing environmental concerns. Although Bhutan’s foray into Bitcoin has not been without challenges—its involvement with failed platforms like BlockFi and Celsius highlights the risks of overexposure to the crypto market—the country’s leadership has remained committed to using Bitcoin as a tool for long-term growth. Bhutan’s story offers a compelling case for nations exploring Bitcoin as part of a diversified financial strategy. The bigger picture: Bitcoin as a national reserve El Salvador and Bhutan’s strategies point to a broader trend: the growing interest in Bitcoin as an alternative to traditional reserve assets like gold or oil. Advocates argue that Bitcoin’s decentralization and fixed supply make it an attractive store of value, immune to inflationary pressures that erode fiat currencies. While critics point to Bitcoin’s volatility as a limitation, these nations are banking on its long-term upward trend to solidify their economic foundations. President Bukele’s vision for Bitcoin City exemplifies this belief. Designed as a tax-free zone powered entirely by renewable geothermal energy, the city will attract global investment and solidify El Salvador’s position as a Bitcoin hub. Bhutan’s mining operations similarly reflect confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a transformative asset capable of driving national revenue and innovation. Other nations are taking note. Argentina, under its pro-crypto leadership, is reportedly exploring strategies similar to El Salvador’s Volcano Bonds to stabilize its economy and attract foreign investment. As Bitcoin continues to trend upward, the successes of El Salvador and Bhutan could inspire a new wave of crypto-driven economic policies across the globe. Balancing Risk and Reward The bold strategies of El Salvador and Bhutan come with inherent risks. Bitcoin’s volatility remains a challenge, exposing these nations to potential economic shocks during downturns. However, history shows that every emerging technology faces scepticism and cycles of growth before becoming mainstream. These countries are embracing innovation, betting on Bitcoin, and understanding that its transformative potential outweighs short-term uncertainties. For El Salvador, Bitcoin has already proven its value as a store of wealth, with the treasury benefiting from its significant price rallies. Bhutan’s strategic mining investments similarly highlight the power of Bitcoin to generate sustainable revenue. Both nations demonstrate that, with thoughtful planning and strong leadership, Bitcoin can be more than a speculative asset—it can be a cornerstone of national economic strategy. Bitcoin’s transformative promise El Salvador and Bhutan have charted bold paths into the crypto frontier. They showcase how small nations can harness Bitcoin to drive innovation, financial inclusion, and economic growth. And their stories are not just about profiting from Bitcoin’s price rallies but about redefining what is possible when nations commit to decentralized assets as a core component of their economic strategies. Bitcoin continues its global ascent, and these countries stand as examples of what is achievable through courage and vision. While challenges remain, the success of El Salvador and Bhutan sends a powerful message: Bitcoin is a game changer, not just a gamble. For nations willing to embrace the future, the rewards could far outweigh the risks.

37542204,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392318,1734004957,Top 7 Trending Altcoins for 10x Profits Next Week,"The post Top 7 Trending Altcoins for 10x Profits Next Week appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Crypto analyst Tracer has caused a stir in the crypto community with a bold prediction: Altseason, the highly anticipated market phase where altcoins outperform Bitcoin, is just seven days away. Comparing this forecast to the explosive rallies of 2021, Tracer suggests that small investments could turn $100 into $100,000 with the right picks. Although the true Altseason is expected in 2025, the early hype could still have a big impact on the current down market. During Altseason, altcoins typically experience a surge in dominance, and Tracer expects this could peak at 60%-62%. This is similar to what has happened in previous market cycles, where corrections led to new all-time highs. If history repeats itself, investors might be on the brink of a major market boom! Good Time to Buy Altcoins? Altseason refers to a period when altcoins— cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin —see significant price increases. These rallies usually follow market corrections after Bitcoin dominance peaks. During these times, investors shift their focus to smaller tokens with greater growth potential. Tracer believes altcoins are about to go “parabolic,” meaning their prices could rise sharply, offering huge returns for early investors who make the right picks. Milky Bull , another well-known crypto analyst, predicts that this Altseason could last until March 2025 before a major market correction occurs. This forecast aligns with the growing interest in altcoins, with the Altcoin Season Index currently at 67. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Are Defying Trading Volume Slumps , Tracer’s Top Altcoin Picks for Altseason Tracer has recommended seven altcoins he believes will perform well during this upcoming Altseason. Here are two of his top picks: POPCAT POPCAT, a popular meme coin, is expected to attract a lot of liquidity during the rally. With a market cap of $1.03 billion, this token is well-positioned for growth once Altseason begins. HEART HEART, an AI-focused project, has shown strong resilience during the current market correction. With a market cap of $209.95 million, this project is backed by a team building an AI platform that’s likely to attract increasing demand in the future. Other Notable Altcoins to Watch In addition to POPCAT and HEART, Tracer has highlighted several other tokens with great potential: ME : Tied to Magic Eden, a top NFT marketplace for Bitcoin and Solana, ME is trading at attractive prices right now. TRAC : A token that supports an AI-driven knowledge infrastructure, TRAC is poised to attract institutional investment. TURBO : With a strong market presence and a Coinbase listing, TURBO is a popular pick for liquidity inflows. 0x0.ai : This project focuses on AI-based security and revenue tools, combining innovation and practical utility. Tracer’s list of recommended tokens includes a mix of meme coins, NFT-related tokens, and AI-powered projects. All of these are positioned to potentially benefit from the upcoming Altseason. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Experts’ Answer Is Surprising Utility Token With 100x Potential ‘DTX Exchange’,"The post Which Altcoin Could Dethrone DOGE In 2025? Experts’ Answer Is Surprising Utility Token With 100x Potential ‘DTX Exchange’ appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Since the US elections and Donald Trump’s support for digital assets, the inflow into the crypto market has increased significantly. November has been one of the best months for crypto investors, as many cryptos have given triple-digit returns. One of the top gainers and blue-chip crypto, Dogecoin, has experienced a strong rally during the first upswing of the bull market. However, in the profit booking of the last three sessions, it has corrected 21%, undercutting the $0.4 support level. The Dogecoin rally is often attributed to the hype by the community. Conversely, value investors tend to focus on utility-driven coins. Experts’ recent investments show that they are picking projects with real-world utilities like DTX Exchange (DTX). While profit booking in DOGE is evident, DTX Exchange has seen an inflow of over $1.67 million in the first week of the sixth stage of the presale. Experts predict that after the launch, it could rise by 80-100X. Dogecoin Struggles To Find Support Amid Breakdown Dogecoin is one of the best memecoins, with a market cap of $57 billion. From its breakout in October, it has increased by 270%, creating a high of $0.484. This shows aggressive growth after the prolonged correction, but in the last 30 days, it failed to cross the near supply zone. Courtesy: TradingView Dogecoin has corrected from the previous high to the current level of $0.406 and is yet to find support. The trading volume has dropped by 22% to $10.02 billion, showcasing volatility contraction in the price action. DOGE is continuously facing major resistance at the $0.467 mark, a level it has tested multiple times. Each attempt to break past this point has met strong pushback. However, with repeated tests weakening the resistance, Dogecoin could break through on its next try. Due to this prolonged consolidation, expert DOGE investors have booked profits and shifted to better opportunities like the DTX Exchange. Investors Jumping To The DTX Exchange As It Scales Rapidly DTX Exchange has gained significant attention as it has achieved the most awaited milestone of $10 million in its token presale. Rapid ecosystem developments enabled the platform to surpass this milestone ahead of schedule. The first hybrid trading platform, DTX Exchange (DTX) , utilizes a hybrid approach to blend the features of centralized and decentralized exchanges to provide a seamless and efficient trading platform for traders worldwide. This platform allows users to access various assets and adjust their portfolios according to different market conditions. The recent launch of the VulcanX blockchain has given DTX Exchange unprecedented growth. With the help of this blockchain, traders will get high speed, the lowest transaction fees, and fast order execution. VulcanX was tested on the November testnet launch and achieved a remarkable 10,000 transactions per second, which is among the top. DTX Exchange is currently in the sixth stage, with tokens priced at an undervalued $0.12. Community members get perks like governance and voting rights and will soon have access to potential airdrops. With these rapid developments, DTX Exchange has made its mark in the exchange industry, and soon after the launch, it will be fighting for the top position. Conclusion Dogecoin has exhibited parabolic growth previously, and current market conditions suggest further absorption of supply is needed. On the other hand, experts believe DTX Exchange is an altcoin to focus on because it could be the next big thing, potentially providing 10,000% returns. With its rapid development, DTX Exchange has made its mark in the exchange industry, and soon after the launch, it will be fighting for the top position.

37542737,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51967,1734004910,Recent Ripple CEO Predictions Signal Big Opportunities for RLUSD and XRP,"In a video circulating on social media, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse made noteworthy comments regarding the stablecoin market, particularly highlighting the potential future of Tether (USDT) and the opportunities it might create for Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. Garlinghouse’s remarks have generated significant attention, especially from crypto enthusiasts like Amelie, a prominent influencer, who linked his comments to the broader potential of RLUSD within the XRP ecosystem. WOW! BRAD GARLINGHOUSE: „TETHER MIGHT CONTINUE TO GROW, BUT I DOUBT IT WILL HAVE THE SAME MARKET SHARE IN TWO YEARS!“ „THAT‘LL BE BENEFICIAL FOR RLUSD?“ „YEAH!“ ‚RLUSD‘ WILL DO FOR #XRP WHAT USDT DID FOR BITCOIN! pic.twitter.com/pHUsnrbqEf — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) December 11, 2024 Garlinghouse expressed skepticism about Tether’s ability to maintain its market share over the next two years, even if its overall market size continues to grow. He emphasized the importance of bringing more liquidity on-chain and increasing liquidity within the XRP Ledger (XRPL) ecosystem. These moves, he noted, would benefit the XRP community as a whole. Garlinghouse also addressed the potential impact of upcoming stablecoin regulations in the United States, drawing parallels to the regulatory landscape in the European Union. He suggested that legislative changes could disrupt Tether’s dominance in the market. “I think it would be beneficial for all stablecoins that are compliance first, that take a regulatory front-foot approach,” he stated, adding that RLUSD represents one such example of a compliant stablecoin likely to thrive in a regulated environment. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Regulatory Progress and RLUSD’s Future Prospects Garlinghouse’s comments come at a time when Ripple has achieved a significant regulatory milestone. This week, Ripple received final approval for RLUSD from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). The approval paves the way for RLUSD to be listed on exchanges and integrated with Ripple’s partners. Garlinghouse confirmed the development via Twitter, noting that further updates on RLUSD’s launch and deployment would be shared through official Ripple channels. This regulatory approval places RLUSD in a strong position to capitalize on the evolving stablecoin market, particularly as global and domestic regulatory frameworks continue to shape the industry. The Role of RLUSD in the XRP Ecosystem RLUSD is expected to play a pivotal role in enhancing the liquidity and utility of the XRPL. In the tweet, Amelie compared RLUSD’s potential impact on XRP to how Tether (USDT) has supported Bitcoin’s liquidity and adoption. By providing a regulated and compliant stablecoin option, RLUSD aims to attract institutional and retail users seeking stability and transparency in digital transactions. As stablecoin legislation takes shape in the U.S., compliance-focused offerings like RLUSD could gain a competitive edge. This aligns with Garlinghouse’s broader vision of positioning Ripple as a leader in regulated financial technology.

42389477,5d388418-bb37-43f6-bfab-70cd8df2d0ff,1734004800,"Crypto Daybook Americas: Bitcoin Bulls, Remember to Zoom Out When in Doubt","By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)  The crypto market is looking to maintain the bullish momentum ignited by Wednesday's U.S. CPI report, which matched estimates and cleared the path for another Federal Reserve rate cut next week.   BTC has retaken $100,000 and ether is again eyeing $4,000. A number of tokens, including AAVE and LINK, are trading 10% higher on the back of accumulation by wallets tied to World Liberty Financial, the project supported by President-elect Donald Trump's family.  The key question now is whether BTC's rally will be long-lasting. It could be, thanks to bitcoin's consistent price premium on Coinbase compared with global exchanges and healthier leverage levels in the broader market. The upside may be capped, however, if the producer price index shows hotter inflation in the pipeline.   ""Any upside surprise — and what it means for next Friday's release of the core PCE deflator — could prove a minor dollar positive,"" ING said.  For cues on whether $100K is a major top, my advice is simple: when in doubt, zoom out.   At $100,000, the annualized three-month BTC futures basis on major exchanges hovers around 15%, way below the 30%-plus witnessed at the height of 2021's bull market. That's a sign the gain is driven by genuine buying in the spot market, which is longer-lasting than speculative leverage-led bull runs.  Zooming out also brings the second half of 2021 into the frame. That's when college kids in their late teens worldwide traded tokens like DOT, SOL, ETH and other cryptocurrencies without any know-how of their use case.   It's also when the bull market topped.   Fast forward to now, and main street is silent on crypto. Remember what Leonardo Di Caprio said in The Wolf of Wall Street: ""By the time you read about it in The Wall Street Journal, it's already too late.""  If that’s not enough, the $100,000 milestone is also marked by a rise in institutional participation and active lobbying by crypto community for favorable regulatory environment.   Speaking of bull market continuation, ether looks primed to move above $5,000 as booming on-chain activity burns more of the token, reducing supply in the market, according to CryptoQuant.   ""According to ETH's realized price—the average price at which holders purchased their ETH—the current upper limit for ETH's price stands around $5.2k,"" the firm told CoinDesk.  The bullish outlook for ether is generally seen as good news for other altcoins too, although, according to Delphi Digital, the token supply is ""too damn high,"" thanks to projects like pump.fun. The resulting demand-supply imbalance makes finding the alpha that much more challenging in the altcoin sector. Stay alert!

Ai16z, a fund based on AI-based trading signals, has crossed an $850 million market capitalization to flip GOAT, which kickstarted the AI agents sector in October. Holders of AI16Z tokens pitch ideas to ""AI Marc,"" an AI agent modeled after Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) partner Marc Andreessen, to influence and suggest investment decisions.  The fund holds upward of $10 million from 30,000 unique “partners,” a feat it has achieved in a little over a month since going live.  The AI16Z price has surged 77% in the past seven days and more than tripled in the past 14 days, CoinGecko data shows. That's more than GOAT and other AI agent tokens that function solely as memes or online chatbots.  The action shows the market's evolving preferences for projects offering entertainment value and tangible utility — where technical projects masquerading as memes may continue to attract more demand in the coming months.  “$ai16z flipping $goat is a huge signal for the AI agent sector,” crypto trader @Defi0xJeff wrote in an X post. “It shows how the new generation of agents is progressing at a much faster pace than the old guard. This is bullish not just for $ai16z but for the entire ecosystem.”  Derivatives Positioning  BTC and ETH implied volatility term structures have steepened alongside price rises.   Calls have become pricier than puts as BTC's move back above $100,000 has reduced fears of a protracted pullback.   A market participant bought a large calendar spread by buying the $110K strike call expiring Jan. 3 while selling the $100K call expiring Dec. 27. The strategy aims to profit from the price decay in the Jan. 27 expiry while being protected from an upside volatility explosion.   In ETH, the notable trade was a bull call spread at $4,300 and $4,500 strikes.

37544947,https://cryptonews.com/?p=318945,1734004795,IcomTech Scammers Fined $5M as Mastermind Faces 10 Years in Prison,"A California court has fined five individuals involved in IcomTech’s fraudulent Bitcoin Ponzi scheme $5 million. The court ruling , announced on December 11, 2024, found the defendants guilty of fraud and misappropriation of funds through a fake cryptocurrency trading operation. Ruling Targets Five Defendants The ruling targets David Carmona, Juan Arellano Parra, Moses Valdez, and David Brend, who were found in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations. Marco A. Ruiz Ochoa received a separate consent order. The five defendants falsely promised investors returns from Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies through a non-existent mining and trading platform. They fraudulently solicited over $1 million from 190 individuals across the United States and internationally, leading to approximately $8.4 million in misappropriated funds by December 2022. Crypto Alert! Five promoters behind the IcomTech Ponzi scheme have been ordered to pay over $5M in penalties and restitution for defrauding investors. IcomTech, falsely touted as a Bitcoin mining and trading firm, promised returns up to 100% but collapsed in 2019, leaving… — TokyoJP (@ChiyodatokyoJP) December 12, 2024 As part of the ruling, Carmona, Arellano Parra, Valdez, and Brend will each pay a $1 million civil penalty and contribute $1 million in restitution to the victims. Ochoa, along with the others, will also pay restitution. The financial penalty exceeds $5 million, and all five individuals have been permanently banned from engaging with CFTC-regulated markets. IcomTech Mastermind Sentenced to 10 Years in Prison This decision follows criminal sentences handed down earlier. In October, Carmona, the mastermind behind IcomTech, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Rodriguez was sentenced to eight years on October 31, while Brend received a 10-year sentence on December 2. In January, Ochoa was sentenced to five years in prison for his role in the scheme. Between 2018 and 2019, IcomTech promised investors a 100% return every six weeks. IcomTech promoters enacted the massive crypto scheme by attending lavish expos in luxury cars and wearing expensive clothing, giving the illusion that the sham digital asset company could offer investors financial freedom. However, this facade began to crumble by August 2018 as investors struggled to withdraw their funds from the platform. “As complaints mounted, IcomTech began offering proprietary crypto-tokens for sale as a means of injecting liquidity into IcomTech,” the press release states. “Promoters of the schemes claimed that these tokens…would eventually be worth a significant amount of money…” In reality, the tokens had zero real value. This led to further financial harm to the schemes’ victims, who stopped receiving funds entirely by the end of 2019.

37542071,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109312,1734004698,Bitcoin Struggles to Break $100K Amid Liquidity Decline and Nvidia Stock Slump,"Bitcoin (BTC), the flagship cryptocurrency, is grappling with resistance at the $100,000 mark. Over the past three weeks, its price has hovered in the $90,000–$100,000 range, raising questions about its ability to sustain its bullish momentum. Analysts have identified two primary factors contributing to Bitcoin’s price stagnation: a significant decline in liquidity inflows and a concerning slump in Nvidia’s (NVDA) stock. Let’s delve into these factors to understand the challenges Bitcoin faces in breaking through the psychological $100,000 barrier. Liquidity Inflows Decline: A Key Factor Impacting Bitcoin’s Momentum One of the main reasons Bitcoin struggles to break $100K is the sharp decline in liquidity inflows. Liquidity is the lifeblood of any financial market, and its reduction directly impacts market activity and price movements. Data from 10X Research reveals that the market liquidity impulse index—a composite metric tracking stablecoin issuance, spot BTC ETF inflows, and futures market changes—has plummeted by over 50%. From a high of $15 billion in early November, the index now stands at $7 billion. Spot ETFs and Stablecoin Issuance in Decline Spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), often touted as game-changers for cryptocurrency adoption, have seen reduced inflows. Analysts suggest that this could be due to macroeconomic uncertainties and investor hesitation as the market grapples with volatile conditions. Additionally, stablecoin issuance—a critical liquidity provider in crypto markets—has decreased. Stablecoins like USDT and USDC are commonly used to facilitate trading, and their lower issuance signals diminished trading activity and reduced demand for Bitcoin. Implications for the BTC Market The declining liquidity has a cascading effect on Bitcoin’s price action. Lower inflows lead to reduced buying pressure, making it harder for BTC to sustain upward momentum. Furthermore, with liquidity providers stepping back, the market becomes more susceptible to price volatility and external shocks. Nvidia Stock Slump: A Surprising Correlation with Bitcoin Bitcoin’s recent price action has shown a strong positive correlation with Nvidia’s stock, highlighting the interconnectedness between tech equities and cryptocurrency markets. Since bottoming out in 2022, both assets have often moved in tandem, with their current three-month correlation at 0.6 . Why Nvidia Matters to Bitcoin Nvidia has become a key player in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, especially due to its role in GPU manufacturing for mining operations. A slump in Nvidia’s stock signals broader tech market challenges, which could dampen investor sentiment across correlated assets like Bitcoin. Recent concerns over AI market saturation and reduced GPU demand have contributed to Nvidia’s stock decline. This has indirectly affected Bitcoin, as investors reassess risk exposure to high-growth, volatile assets in both tech and crypto sectors. Market Sentiment and the Correlation The correlation between Bitcoin and Nvidia highlights how intertwined global financial markets have become. When major tech stocks like Nvidia experience turbulence, it often spills over into the crypto space, as both asset classes share overlapping investor profiles. Broader Market Implications The dual impact of declining liquidity and Nvidia’s slump reflects broader challenges in the crypto market. Despite significant institutional interest in Bitcoin, the lack of sustained inflows suggests caution among investors. Institutional Hesitation Institutions have played a pivotal role in Bitcoin’s price surge over the past year, especially through products like spot ETFs. However, the current stagnation indicates that institutions are holding back, possibly awaiting regulatory clarity or better macroeconomic conditions. Retail Investors and Volatility Retail investors, who were once a driving force behind Bitcoin’s bull runs, appear to be less active in the current market. Reduced retail participation, combined with the liquidity crunch, makes the market more vulnerable to sharp price swings. What’s Next for Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s struggle to break $100K raises questions about its immediate future. While the current stagnation is concerning, analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. Catalysts for a Breakout Increased Liquidity: A resurgence in stablecoin issuance and ETF inflows could reignite Bitcoin’s upward momentum. Macroeconomic Stability: A more favorable global economic environment may encourage risk-on sentiment among investors. Regulatory Clarity: Progress in crypto regulations, particularly concerning ETFs, could attract institutional inflows. Potential Risks On the flip side, prolonged liquidity issues and further declines in correlated assets like Nvidia could keep Bitcoin under pressure. Additionally, heightened regulatory scrutiny or macroeconomic shocks could exacerbate market uncertainties. Conclusion Bitcoin’s current price stagnation highlights the interplay between liquidity dynamics and broader market factors, such as Nvidia’s stock performance. While the $100,000 milestone remains elusive, the challenges are not insurmountable. As the crypto market matures, factors like increased liquidity, institutional interest, and technological advancements are likely to pave the way for future growth.

The Bitcoin market alone has witnessed a surge of 138.2%. Can the trend continue in 2025? A report, released by CoinShares , predicts that the upcoming Trump regime would bring in some major regulatory changes for the crypto sector. Here is a breakdown of the key trends that could shape the crypto landscape in the coming year. Read on! US Crypto Regulation Under Trump The victory of pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump against Kamala Harris, who represented a crypto-skeptic regime, overturned the political sentiment of the US towards the crypto industry. During the election campaign itself, Trump promised to save the crypto sector from the clutches of excessive regulation. The CoinShares report suggests that Donald Trump, who is expected to take oath as the US president on January 25, 2025, would revamp the crypto regulation framework . It also indicates that he would introduce certain policies to support crypto miners, particularly those focusing solely on the Bitcoin mining market. Bitcoin ETFs and Institutional Adoption Emphasising that at this juncture only 20% of the Asset Under Management of Bitcoin ETFs are controlled by institutional investors, the report notes that if more institutional investors enter the market, it would lead to massive growth . Rise of Bitcoin-Yielding Companies The report emphasises the emerging trend of companies adopting Bitcoin as treasury assets. Highlighting how companies like MicroStrategy, Block, Marathon Digital and Metaplant use innovative strategies to achieve big using Bitcoin, the report notes that there are three popular Bitcoin yield strategies: holding growth, yield farming and derivatives. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top Altcoins for Minimum 10X Profits in the Next 7 Days , Growing Corporate Interest in Crypto Payments Emphasising how leading companies like Amazon, Shopify and Nike are eagerly preparing to integrate cryptos into payments, the report forecasts that some of these companies may adopt Bitcoin in their treasuries in the next year. Ethereum’s Layer 2 Expansion & Solana’s Upgrades for Scalability The report acknowledges that Layer 2 chains are getting more attention from institutional players. It states that the Pectra Upgrade of Ethereum could help the chain achieve more efficiency. Meanwhile, it opines that validator clients, Frankendancer and Firedancer, aim to improve Solana’s performance and scalability. In conclusion, CoinShares’s 2025 predictions highlight promising developments for the crypto sector, particularly Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37542070,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109315,1734004500,Hong Kong Government Dismisses Crypto Integration Into Fiscal Reserves,"Hong Kong’s government has declined a proposal to integrate cryptocurrencies into its fiscal reserves, signaling a cautious stance on adopting digital assets in its economic strategy. The decision follows a proposal by a Hong Kong lawmaker to include cryptocurrencies in the city’s Exchange Fund for ongoing purchases. While the government ruled out prioritizing crypto assets, it left the door slightly open for small-scale investments in the space. This development highlights Hong Kong’s careful approach to cryptocurrency adoption in public financial management, balancing innovation with prudence. The Proposal to Add Cryptocurrencies to Fiscal Reserves The idea of integrating cryptocurrencies into Hong Kong’s fiscal reserves gained attention after a lawmaker suggested leveraging the city’s Exchange Fund to acquire and hold digital assets. The proposal was aimed at positioning Hong Kong as a progressive player in the evolving global financial landscape. The Exchange Fund, which serves as a reserve for safeguarding the stability of Hong Kong’s monetary system, manages significant assets. Including cryptocurrencies in this fund could have marked a bold step toward legitimizing digital assets as part of national financial strategies. Government’s Stance: Caution Over Bold Adoption In its response, the Hong Kong government dismissed the proposal, stating that cryptocurrencies are not a priority for the fiscal reserves. This decision underscores the administration’s cautious approach to integrating high-risk, volatile assets into its robust financial ecosystem. Reasons for Rejection Volatility of Cryptocurrencies: Digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum are notoriously volatile, making them unsuitable for reserves that require stability and liquidity. Regulatory Concerns: Despite Hong Kong’s progressive crypto regulations, global scrutiny around cryptocurrencies remains high, adding risks to their adoption in state-level financial instruments. Strategic Focus: The government emphasized that its priority lies in strengthening the existing financial infrastructure rather than experimenting with emerging asset classes. Small-Scale Investments: A Ray of Possibility? While rejecting large-scale integration of cryptocurrencies into fiscal reserves, the Hong Kong government did not entirely rule out small-scale crypto investments. This nuanced position reflects a willingness to explore the potential of digital assets without exposing the city’s financial system to undue risks. Potential Areas for Small-Scale Investment Blockchain Startups: Investments in blockchain technologies and startups could align with Hong Kong’s broader push to become a hub for Web3 innovation. Tokenized Assets: Small-scale investments in tokenized real estate or bonds could provide a controlled environment to test the benefits of digital asset integration. Hong Kong’s Crypto Landscape: A Mixed Approach Hong Kong has been actively positioning itself as a global crypto hub, introducing favorable regulations and promoting blockchain innovation. However, the government’s decision to exclude cryptocurrencies from fiscal reserves reveals a dual strategy: fostering private sector growth in crypto while maintaining conservative public financial practices. Progressive Policies for the Private Sector Licensing Regime for Crypto Exchanges: Hong Kong has implemented a comprehensive licensing framework for digital asset trading platforms, ensuring a secure environment for investors. Support for Web3 Development: The government has committed resources to support Web3 startups, making the city a magnet for blockchain entrepreneurs. Conservative Public Financial Management Despite its openness to innovation, Hong Kong remains cautious about incorporating crypto into public finance, focusing on mitigating risks and maintaining stability in its financial system. Global Context: How Other Nations Approach Crypto Reserves Hong Kong’s decision aligns with the cautious approach taken by most nations regarding cryptocurrencies in fiscal reserves. Countries Exploring Crypto in National Funds El Salvador: The Central American nation has adopted Bitcoin as legal tender and incorporated it into public financial strategies, though the move has been met with criticism for its risks. UAE: The United Arab Emirates is exploring blockchain applications but has yet to integrate cryptocurrencies into its sovereign wealth funds. Lessons from Global Experiments While nations like El Salvador have embraced bold crypto strategies, their experiences highlight the challenges of managing volatility and securing long-term value. Hong Kong’s cautious stance reflects its intent to avoid similar pitfalls. What This Means for the Future of Crypto in Hong Kong The government’s dismissal of large-scale crypto integration into fiscal reserves does not imply a complete rejection of digital assets. Instead, it signifies a balanced approach, wherein public finance remains conservative while the private sector drives innovation. Opportunities for Private Sector Growth The government’s support for blockchain and crypto startups creates a favorable environment for experimentation and growth. This could position Hong Kong as a leader in Web3 innovation, attracting global talent and investment. Long-Term Prospects As the crypto industry matures and regulatory frameworks evolve, Hong Kong may revisit its stance on integrating digital assets into public financial strategies. Until then, its approach will likely focus on enabling innovation while safeguarding financial stability. Conclusion Hong Kong’s decision to dismiss cryptocurrency integration into its fiscal reserves underscores a pragmatic approach to digital asset adoption. By prioritizing stability in public finances and fostering growth in the private sector, the city aims to balance innovation with risk management. While cryptocurrencies may not find a place in fiscal reserves today, the government’s openness to small-scale investments and its broader support for blockchain innovation signal a commitment to exploring their potential in the future.

37542069,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109317,1734004433,"Bernstein Analysts Expect MicroStrategy’s Growth to Continue, Target Price Set at $600","MicroStrategy, a leading enterprise software and Bitcoin investment company, is poised for significant growth according to Bernstein analysts. With its potential inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 and the incoming Trump administration’s pro-crypto stance, analysts have set an ambitious target price of $600 for the stock. The company’s strategic Bitcoin acquisitions and institutional traction are expected to drive this growth, despite its premium valuation. Let’s dive into the factors underpinning Bernstein’s optimistic forecast for MicroStrategy and its implications for the broader crypto and stock markets. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin-Centric Strategy: A Key Driver MicroStrategy has become synonymous with Bitcoin investments, having amassed over $16 billion in Bitcoin to date. This strategic pivot has transformed the company into a prominent institutional player in the cryptocurrency market, with its stock increasingly viewed as a proxy for Bitcoin’s performance. The Impact of Bitcoin Holdings MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy is a cornerstone of its growth narrative. Analysts believe that further Bitcoin purchases will continue to bolster its balance sheet, enhancing its appeal to investors seeking crypto exposure. ETF Inclusion to Drive Demand Bernstein predicts that MicroStrategy’s potential inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 will spark a surge in demand, particularly from exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Estimates suggest that this inclusion could result in $2.1 billion in ETF-driven purchases of the stock, providing a significant boost to its valuation. Nasdaq 100 Inclusion: A Game-Changer for MicroStrategy Inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 index would mark a major milestone for MicroStrategy, elevating its profile among institutional investors. Why Nasdaq 100 Inclusion Matters Enhanced Visibility: Inclusion in a prestigious index like the Nasdaq 100 increases visibility and legitimacy, attracting new investors. Liquidity Boost: ETFs and index funds tracking the Nasdaq 100 would be required to purchase MicroStrategy stock, driving up demand. Validation of Strategy: Inclusion would validate MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin-focused strategy, signaling confidence from the broader financial market. Potential Challenges While Nasdaq 100 inclusion is promising, the premium valuation of MicroStrategy’s stock remains a concern. Critics argue that the company’s reliance on Bitcoin exposes it to heightened volatility, which could deter risk-averse investors. The Trump Administration’s Crypto Focus: A Tailwind for Growth The incoming Trump administration’s renewed focus on cryptocurrency is expected to benefit companies like MicroStrategy. Pro-crypto policies could drive further adoption of digital assets, creating a favorable environment for firms heavily invested in Bitcoin. Crypto-Friendly Policies Regulatory Clarity: Supportive regulations could encourage institutional adoption of Bitcoin, indirectly boosting MicroStrategy’s valuation. Market Expansion: Government endorsement of crypto could expand the market, driving up the value of Bitcoin and benefiting companies with significant holdings. Impact on Institutional Investment Institutional interest in Bitcoin is already on the rise, and a supportive regulatory environment could accelerate this trend. MicroStrategy stands to benefit as more institutions seek indirect exposure to Bitcoin through its stock. Premium Valuation: A Double-Edged Sword Despite the bullish outlook, MicroStrategy’s high valuation has raised concerns among some analysts. Arguments for Premium Valuation Scarcity Factor: MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings make it a unique asset, justifying a premium price. First-Mover Advantage: The company’s early adoption of Bitcoin positions it as a leader in the crypto space, attracting long-term investors. Risks of Overvaluation However, critics warn that the stock’s high valuation could deter new investors, especially during periods of Bitcoin price volatility. Additionally, the company’s reliance on debt financing for Bitcoin purchases may expose it to financial risks if Bitcoin’s value declines. Analysts’ Target Price: $600 Bernstein’s $600 target price reflects optimism about MicroStrategy’s ability to capitalize on its Bitcoin-centric strategy and upcoming opportunities. Key Factors Supporting the Target Price Bitcoin Momentum: Continued growth in Bitcoin’s price could further boost MicroStrategy’s valuation. Institutional Inflows: Increased institutional interest, driven by Nasdaq 100 inclusion and pro-crypto policies, is expected to fuel demand for the stock. Strategic Positioning: As a pioneer in Bitcoin adoption, MicroStrategy is well-positioned to benefit from the crypto market’s growth. Cautious Optimism While Bernstein’s outlook is positive, the target price assumes favorable market conditions and continued Bitcoin adoption. Any regulatory setbacks or macroeconomic headwinds could impact the company’s growth trajectory. Conclusion MicroStrategy’s potential inclusion in the Nasdaq 100, coupled with its Bitcoin-focused strategy and a supportive policy environment, paints a promising picture for the company’s future. Despite concerns over its premium valuation, analysts remain optimistic about its growth prospects, setting a target price of $600 for the stock. As the crypto and stock markets continue to evolve, MicroStrategy’s trajectory will serve as a bellwether for the broader adoption of digital assets. Its success could inspire other companies to embrace Bitcoin as a strategic asset, further integrating cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance.

Speaking to Bloomberg, billionaire entrepreneur and founder of leading US brokerage firm Interactive Brokers, Thomas Peterffy, argued that everyone should own Bitcoin. However, Peterffy, who opened a parenthesis on this issue, said that investors are too much “Everyone who does not have Bitcoin (BTC) should have it. But there is no need to keep it too much.” “Everyone should have some Bitcoin. But you should invest 2-3% of your net worth in Bitcoin. Because investing more than 10% of your assets in Bitcoin is very risky.” Peterffy stated that the volatility of BTC and cryptocurrencies is behind these statements. The celebrity admitted that he is afraid of cryptocurrencies due to their volatility and described them as basically just a figment of his imagination. “So it doesn't have any underlying volume.

37541908,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109319,1734004271,Travala Launches Bitcoin Reserve After Surpassing $100M Revenue Milestone,"Travala, a leading cryptocurrency-focused travel agency, has announced the establishment of a Bitcoin and AVA reserve following a remarkable revenue milestone. The company reported $100 million in annual revenue for 2024, a substantial increase from $59.6 million in 2023. This achievement underscores Travala’s success in integrating cryptocurrencies into the travel industry. The reserve marks a strategic move to support Travala’s long-term growth, with potential plans to expand its treasury with additional tokens as the crypto market evolves. Crypto Payments Drive Travala’s Revenue Growth Travala’s $100 million revenue milestone was driven by its unique model, which allows users to book travel services using over 100 different cryptocurrencies. This approach has positioned Travala as a pioneer in crypto adoption within the travel sector. Key Contributors to Revenue Growth Wide Crypto Acceptance: Travala supports a diverse range of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, and its native AVA token. Global Reach: Operating in over 230 countries, the platform offers access to more than 3 million travel products, from flights to hotels. Crypto Incentives: Travala’s AVA token rewards and discounts encourage crypto payments, boosting user engagement and loyalty. Surpassing 2023 Revenue In 2023, Travala reported $59.6 million in revenue. The jump to $100 million in 2024 reflects the increasing popularity of crypto payments among travelers and Travala’s ability to capitalize on this trend. Bitcoin and AVA Reserve: A Strategic Growth Plan The newly announced Bitcoin and AVA reserve signals Travala’s commitment to leveraging digital assets for financial sustainability and growth. Purpose of the Reserve Long-Term Growth: The reserve aims to secure a portion of Travala’s revenue in Bitcoin and AVA, safeguarding the company’s future in a volatile market. Market Opportunities: Holding a Bitcoin reserve allows Travala to capitalize on potential appreciation, aligning its financial strategy with the growing adoption of digital assets. Support for AVA Ecosystem: The reserve reinforces Travala’s native AVA token, enhancing its utility and value within the platform. Potential Expansion of the Treasury Plan Travala hinted at expanding its treasury with additional tokens as the crypto market evolves. This flexibility allows the company to adapt to changing trends and emerging technologies in the digital asset space.

Decentralized Ecosystem: Travala’s model demonstrates the potential of a decentralized travel ecosystem, where users and providers interact directly. Influence on Competitors Travala’s success may inspire other travel agencies to adopt similar models, further driving crypto adoption in the industry. Competitors that fail to innovate risk losing market share as demand for crypto-friendly services grows. Challenges and Opportunities While Travala’s Bitcoin reserve and crypto-centric model are promising, challenges remain. Challenges Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are subject to significant price fluctuations, which could impact the value of Travala’s reserves. Regulatory Uncertainty: As governments around the world establish crypto regulations, compliance will be critical for Travala’s continued growth. Opportunities Crypto Adoption: With cryptocurrency adoption on the rise, Travala is well-positioned to capture a growing market. Partnerships and Expansion: Collaborations with crypto platforms and travel providers could further strengthen Travala’s offerings.

Since the beginning of the year, Binance has registered about $21.6 billion in user funds deposits, which is 36 percent higher than what the next 10 exchanges combined registered. The notable growth in Binance exchange in the past year has been fueled by the ongoing mainstream adoption by institutional investors. Moreover, the average Bitcoin deposit across exchanges jumped from 0.36 BTC to 1.65 BTC year-over-year, while that of Tether’s USDT surged from $19.6k to $230k. “2024 has been a landmark year for the crypto industry, and we are incredibly grateful to our almost 250 million users, and counting, who continue to trust Binance as their chosen platform for trading,” Richard Teng, Binance CEO, noted . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Prediction 2025: CoinShares Predicts Trump’s Crypto-Friendly Policies , Visible Impact on the Binance Ecosystem The Binance ecosystem has grown to a vibrant web3 space , with over $5.6 billion in total value locked (TVL) and over $6.6 billion in stablecoins market cap. According to on-chain data analysis by Defillama, the BSC network registered more than 1 million daily active addresses, which is more than double that of Ethereum (ETH). Having achieved a $100 trillion mark in lifetime traded volume year-to-date, Binance has stamped its market dominance. As a result, BNB is expected to rally exponentially in the coming months, potentially beyond $1000, and regain its former fourth position by market cap. Moreover, BNB is a top-tier altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of over $104 billion and a daily average traded volume of over $2.2 billion. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37541851,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109321,1734004200,"U.S. CPI Rises 2.7% Year-Over-Year in November, Meeting Expectations","The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 2.7% year-over-year in November , according to fresh data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The figure aligns perfectly with market expectations, reflecting steady inflation trends. Monthly, the CPI saw a modest increase of 0.3%, also matching forecasts. Meanwhile, the core CPI, excluding food and energy prices, grew 3.3% over the year and 0.3% month-over-month, both in line with predictions. Understanding the November CPI Data The Consumer Price Index is a vital measure of inflation, tracking changes in the prices consumers pay for goods and services. November’s CPI growth of 2.7% highlights stable inflation, meeting market predictions and offering a sense of stability amid broader economic fluctuations. Core CPI, which strips away volatile food and energy prices, is often regarded as a better gauge of underlying inflationary pressures. Its 3.3% annual rise aligns with expectations, signaling that while inflation is present, it is not accelerating at an alarming pace. Why the CPI Matters The CPI plays a crucial role in shaping economic policies, influencing everything from Federal Reserve decisions to wage adjustments. With November’s CPI in line with forecasts, it reduces uncertainty for policymakers and businesses planning for 2024. Moreover, the Federal Reserve closely monitors the CPI and Core CPI when making decisions about interest rates. Meeting expectations suggests the Fed may continue its current monetary policy stance without abrupt adjustments. A Closer Look at Core Inflation Trends Core inflation’s 3.3% rise over the past year reflects the gradual but steady increase in costs for non-volatile goods and services. This rate indicates that while prices are rising, they are doing so predictably, allowing businesses and consumers to adjust. Sectors such as housing, healthcare, and education remain key contributors to core inflation, as prices in these areas tend to rise steadily regardless of broader economic conditions. Comparing Monthly and Annual CPI Growth The 0.3% monthly rise in November’s CPI suggests consistency in pricing trends. Compared to the same month last year, the annual growth of 2.7% paints a broader picture of inflation’s long-term trajectory. Key takeaways include: Monthly Stability: The consistent 0.3% rise underscores a controlled inflationary environment. Annual Trends: The 2.7% annual growth reflects cumulative changes over time, influenced by global supply chain dynamics and domestic economic policies. Market Reactions to CPI Data Financial markets reacted modestly to the CPI announcement, as the numbers met expectations. Major indices like the S&P 500 and Dow Jones showed minimal fluctuations, reflecting investor confidence in the predictability of inflation trends. Currency markets also remained stable, with the U.S. dollar maintaining its strength against major currencies like the euro and yen. The lack of surprises in the CPI data provided a steadying influence. What Does This Mean for Consumers? For consumers, the CPI data offers insights into the changing cost of living. The 2.7% annual increase suggests that while prices are rising, they remain manageable for most households. Key areas affecting consumers include: Housing: Rising rents and home prices remain a primary driver of inflation. Energy Costs: While volatile, energy prices have shown relative stability in recent months. Food Prices: Grocery bills remain a concern for many, though the CPI report indicates only modest monthly changes. Policy Implications of the November CPI Data The Federal Reserve is unlikely to adjust its monetary policy dramatically in response to November’s CPI figures. With inflation stable and meeting expectations, the Fed can maintain its cautious approach to interest rates. Policymakers may also use this data to assess the effectiveness of past actions, such as interest rate hikes or fiscal stimulus measures, in controlling inflation. Looking Ahead: Inflation in 2024 As 2024 approaches, inflation remains a key focus for economists, businesses, and consumers. November’s CPI data provides a baseline for anticipating future trends. Potential drivers of inflation in the coming months include: Labor Market Trends: Wage growth could influence consumer spending and price levels. Energy Markets: Fluctuations in oil and gas prices remain a wildcard. Supply Chain Resilience: Global disruptions could continue to impact pricing dynamics. Conclusion The U.S. CPI’s 2.7% year-over-year rise in November , in line with expectations, underscores a stable inflationary environment. With core CPI also meeting forecasts, the data provides reassurance to policymakers, markets, and consumers alike. As inflation trends evolve in 2024, staying informed will be crucial for navigating the economic landscape.

37541962,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626429,1734004186,OpenAI goes dark after Apple update combines Siri and ChatGPT,"OpenAI recorded yet another major service disruption on Thursday. ChatGPT experienced an outage just hours after OpenAI announced its integration with iPhone, iPad, and Mac, rendering the service inaccessible worldwide. ChatGPT went down globally around 11:07 p.m. UTC on December 11. The outage also impacted the OpenAI API and Sora services. Users attempting to log in are faced with the warning “ChatGPT is currently unavailable.” However, minutes after the outage, OpenAI apologized to its 200 million users, saying, “We’re experiencing an outage right now. We have identified the issue and are working to roll out a fix.” We're experiencing an outage right now. We have identified the issue and are working to roll out a fix. Sorry and we'll keep you updated! — OpenAI (@OpenAI) December 12, 2024 The organization recognized the problem and resolved it by patching the flaw, which restored the AI chatbot. What happened? The incident occurred on the same day that ChatGPT was integrated into the most recent version of Apple’s virtual assistant, Siri, on iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It coincided with Apple’s announcement on December 11 that ChatGPT would be integrated with Apple Intelligence. This integration enables Siri to access ChatGPT to address specific inquiries, such as inquiries regarding photos and documents. OpenAI’s service went offline at approximately 11:07 p.m. UTC on December 11 and lasted for three hours. Source: Downdetector Downdetecter data indicates that reports of ChatGPT’s network disruptions began at approximately 11:07 p.m. UTC on December 11. Before the volume of incoming reports diminished, approximately 30 minutes later, an average of 1,532 reports over a 15-minute interval occurred. ChatGPT was unavailable for nearly three hours to users worldwide who encountered difficulties on both the web and the app. At present, there is no definitive explanation for the cause of this disruption. Coincidentally, the outage occurred just hours after Meta’s WhatsApp and Facebook experienced a disruption. This disruption marks at least ChatGPT’s fourth network outage in recent months, following similar disruptions in June and August. After ChatGPT experienced a 30-minute outage last month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman issued an apology on X. According to the outage monitoring website Downdetector, the chatbot’s unavailability affected more than 19,000 individuals. Altman acknowledged the outage in a post on X, noting that the company had made significant strides in reliability. However, there is still a significant amount of work to be done. Details of the ChatGPT – Siri merge Apple initially disclosed the ChatGPT integration in June. Then, on Wednesday, it released software updates for its iPhone, iPad, and Mac, which include the ChatGPT integration with Siri. The ChatGPT integration is activated when users ask Siri complex queries. When Siri is posed a question that Apple’s software identifies as better suited for ChatGPT, it requests the user’s permission to access the OpenAI service. Apple asserts that the feature includes privacy safeguards and that OpenAI will not retain requests. The integration is a significant victory for OpenAI, as it exposes its most critical product to millions of iPhone users. Also, Apple is counting on Apple Intelligence to spearhead the marketing campaign for the iPhone 16 lineup, and the iOS 18.2 release is a critical milestone in this regard. The financial details of the agreement have not been disclosed by either Apple or OpenAI. Users can only install and access the Apple Intelligence feature on iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro, or any iPhone 16 models. Although the ChatGPT integration primarily relies on cloud servers, iPhone owners can activate software updates in the General section of the Settings program. However, users will be prompted to configure Apple Intelligence after upgrading to the most recent Apple software as the service will require the download of huge files, such as Apple’s AI models, on their phones to function.

37541806,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109323,1734004100,Microsoft Rejects Bitcoin Investment Proposal Backed by Michael Saylor,"Microsoft Rejects Bitcoin Investment Proposal Backed by Michael Saylor Microsoft shareholders recently turned down a bold proposal advocating for the integration of Bitcoin into the company’s investment strategy. Backed by Michael Saylor, a prominent Bitcoin advocate and the executive chairman of MicroStrategy, the proposal aimed to explore the cryptocurrency’s potential to diversify Microsoft’s asset portfolio. However, the tech giant’s board firmly opposed the idea, pointing to Bitcoin’s volatility and unsuitability for corporate treasury management. The Details Behind the Proposal The proposal presented by shareholders included a detailed assessment of Bitcoin’s potential benefits for Microsoft’s balance sheet. It highlighted how Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against inflation, citing the cryptocurrency’s increasing adoption by institutions worldwide. Michael Saylor, known for his vocal support of Bitcoin, played a pivotal role in championing the initiative. Saylor emphasized that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, limited supply, and growing relevance in the global financial landscape made it a prudent choice for corporations looking to diversify their assets. He argued that Microsoft, as a leader in innovation, could set a precedent for other technology companies by embracing the digital currency. Microsoft’s Stance on Bitcoin Investments Despite the compelling arguments, Microsoft’s board rejected the proposal. The company emphasized its commitment to evaluating diverse investment options that align with its corporate strategy. In its response, the board stated that Bitcoin’s extreme volatility and regulatory uncertainties made it an unsuitable choice for corporate treasury purposes. Moreover, Microsoft highlighted its existing diversified investment approach, which includes robust strategies to mitigate risks while delivering consistent returns. The board’s decision underscored a cautious stance on adopting cryptocurrencies, reflecting broader skepticism among traditional corporations regarding Bitcoin’s viability as a treasury asset. Cryptocurrency Volatility: A Major Concern Bitcoin’s price swings have long been a point of contention for institutional investors. While proponents argue that volatility is a natural characteristic of an emerging asset class, skeptics see it as a major hurdle to mainstream adoption. In 2024 alone, Bitcoin’s price experienced significant fluctuations, leaving many companies wary of incorporating it into their financial strategies. Microsoft’s decision mirrors concerns raised by other major corporations hesitant to adopt Bitcoin. The tech giant’s rejection signals a preference for stable and predictable investment avenues, particularly in the face of ongoing regulatory scrutiny of the cryptocurrency market. Michael Saylor’s Vision and Persistent Advocacy Michael Saylor has been at the forefront of Bitcoin advocacy, transforming his company, MicroStrategy, into one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin. Saylor’s bullish outlook on Bitcoin stems from its perceived potential to replace traditional assets like gold and its role in fostering financial independence. Despite Microsoft’s rejection, Saylor remains undeterred. In a statement following the vote, he reiterated his belief in Bitcoin’s transformative power and expressed optimism that more companies would eventually recognize its value. Saylor’s efforts continue to influence discussions around corporate adoption of Bitcoin, even as resistance persists. The Broader Implications of Microsoft’s Rejection Microsoft’s decision could have far-reaching implications for the cryptocurrency industry. As one of the world’s most influential technology companies, Microsoft’s stance is likely to impact perceptions of Bitcoin’s suitability for corporate treasuries. The rejection could discourage other corporations from considering similar proposals in the short term. However, it also highlights the importance of addressing concerns surrounding cryptocurrency adoption, including regulatory clarity, price stability, and integration with traditional financial systems. Proponents argue that resolving these issues could pave the way for broader acceptance of Bitcoin and other digital assets in corporate settings. Corporate Hesitation in the Face of Innovation Microsoft’s rejection of Bitcoin investments underscores a broader trend among corporations navigating the complexities of cryptocurrency adoption. While companies like Tesla and MicroStrategy have embraced Bitcoin, others remain cautious, prioritizing financial stability over the potential rewards of early adoption. The tech industry’s mixed reactions to Bitcoin reflect a balancing act between innovation and risk management. As cryptocurrencies continue to evolve, companies must weigh the benefits of embracing emerging technologies against the uncertainties they present. Conclusion Microsoft’s rejection of the Bitcoin investment proposal highlights the ongoing debate over the role of cryptocurrencies in corporate finance. While Bitcoin advocates like Michael Saylor continue to push for its adoption, traditional corporations remain cautious, prioritizing stability and regulatory compliance. The decision marks a significant moment in the intersection of technology and finance, raising questions about the future of cryptocurrencies in corporate strategies.

37541773,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392297,1734004100,Chainlink News: Whale Accumulation Signals Bullish Momentum for LINK,"The post Chainlink News: Whale Accumulation Signals Bullish Momentum for LINK appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Chainlink (LINK) recently experienced its first weekly drop in a month, as the crypto market took a bloodbath after a strong rally . This dip is in line with other altcoins like Ethereum and Cardano, which also saw some retreat. Despite this short-term correction, many analysts believe LINK is poised for a strong rebound. Some even predict that it could eventually hit $100 during this bull run, signaling potential for significant growth. Let’s see if Chainlink is the best coin to accumulate in this altcoin season . The market is Bullish for Chainlink In an X post, Santiment highlighted that LINK surpassed $29 for the first time in 37 months, which has caught the attention of crypto investors. This surge is largely due to heavy accumulation by large investors, often referred to as “whales” and “sharks”—wallets holding over 100K LINK. In just the past two months, these investors have added a total of 5.69 million LINK tokens. On the flip side, smaller traders holding less than 100K LINK have sold off 5.67 million LINK tokens. Historically, when large investors accumulate coins from smaller traders who might panic-sell, it often leads to a rise in the asset’s market value. However, the future success of Chainlink depends on Bitcoin’s performance. If Bitcoin stays stable, there’s optimism that those who hold LINK for the long term may be rewarded. Curious about the future of Chainlink? Read Chainlink price prediction and discover why LINK could soar to new heights in the bull run! Analysts Predict $100 Target for LINK Despite recent price fluctuations, analysts remain optimistic about Chainlink’s future. Popular crypto analyst WSB Trader Rocko, known for his accurate market predictions , maintains his view that LINK is still on track to reach $100 in the current bull run. If this prediction holds, it would mean a 354% increase from its current price level of $22.65. Rocko points to Chainlink’s expanding partnerships with major firms such as Coinbase, Swift, and Citi as key factors in its long-term success. Technically Where is Chainlink Chainlink’s involvement with major organizations like Swift, which handles over $150 trillion annually, is also seen as a significant catalyst. An analyst following the project suggests that Chainlink’s integration into Swift’s network could propel its market cap beyond $500 billion in the long run. On the technical side, Chainlink’s price chart shows strong bullish signals, with a “Cup and Handle” pattern forming. This pattern, which indicates a potential price increase, suggests that LINK could target $40.80. Once this level is surpassed, the next milestone will be to break its all-time high of $52.90, setting the stage for its eventual rise to $100. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37541805,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109325,1734004019,Whales Bought More Bitcoin Despite Dip,"Whales Bought More Bitcoin Despite Dip Cryptocurrency whales made a bold move during Bitcoin’s recent price dip, buying significant amounts of the digital asset despite market uncertainty. Renowned cryptocurrency analyst and trader Ali Martinez shared via X (formerly Twitter) that when Bitcoin’s price dropped from $104,000 to $90,000, 342 new wallets holding over 100 Bitcoin each were created. This activity underscores the growing confidence of large-scale investors in Bitcoin’s long-term value, even amid market turbulence. Bitcoin’s Dip: A Test of Investor Sentiment Bitcoin’s drop from $104,000 to $90,000 rattled retail investors but sparked notable activity among whales. These high-net-worth individuals or entities, known for holding and transacting large amounts of Bitcoin, seized the opportunity to accumulate more coins at lower prices. The sharp price decline was attributed to broader market corrections and macroeconomic concerns, including interest rate hikes and regulatory uncertainties. However, the creation of 342 new wallets signals a contrasting perspective from whales, who appear to view the dip as a buying opportunity rather than a cause for alarm. Whale Behavior: A Key Market Indicator The behavior of whales is often seen as a critical indicator of market trends in the cryptocurrency space. When whales buy during dips, it suggests confidence in Bitcoin’s ability to recover and achieve higher valuations over time. Ali Martinez noted that the influx of new wallets holding over 100 BTC each highlights a strategic move by these investors to capitalize on lower prices. Historically, such accumulation phases by whales have preceded significant price recoveries, reinforcing the narrative of Bitcoin as a store of value. Why Whales Are Buying Bitcoin Now Several factors contribute to the increased whale activity during this price dip: Long-Term Growth Potential : Whales often adopt a long-term investment horizon. Despite short-term price volatility, they recognize Bitcoin’s potential to appreciate significantly in the coming years. Institutional Adoption : Increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin provides reassurance to large investors. Recent announcements of Bitcoin ETFs and major financial institutions entering the crypto space have bolstered confidence. Hedging Against Inflation : As inflation remains a global concern, Bitcoin’s finite supply and decentralized nature make it an attractive hedge for large investors. Market Implications of Whale Activity The accumulation of Bitcoin by whales during a price dip could have far-reaching implications for the market: Price Stabilization : Whale purchases at lower prices can help stabilize the market by providing liquidity and preventing further declines. Renewed Confidence : Retail investors often take cues from whale activity. Increased whale buying can restore confidence and attract more buyers to the market. Future Bull Runs : Historically, whale accumulation has been a precursor to Bitcoin bull runs, suggesting that the market could rebound in the near future. Retail vs. Institutional Perspectives While retail investors often react emotionally to price drops, whales and institutions tend to view them as strategic entry points. This divergence in behavior reflects the varying levels of experience and risk tolerance between the two groups. Retail traders may sell during dips to mitigate losses, exacerbating price declines. In contrast, whales capitalize on these moments to accumulate assets at discounted rates, further strengthening their market position. Bitcoin’s Resilience in a Volatile Market Bitcoin’s ability to recover from price dips has been a consistent theme in its history. Despite periodic corrections, the cryptocurrency has demonstrated remarkable resilience, often bouncing back stronger after periods of consolidation. The recent whale activity serves as a reminder of Bitcoin’s enduring appeal among seasoned investors. It also highlights the growing maturity of the cryptocurrency market, where strategic moves by whales can counterbalance panic selling by retail participants. Conclusion The accumulation of Bitcoin by whales during the recent price dip underscores their confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. While short-term volatility may deter some investors, whales continue to view Bitcoin as a valuable store of wealth and a hedge against economic uncertainty. As 342 new wallets holding over 100 BTC each were created, the cryptocurrency market is once again reminded of the significant role whales play in shaping its trajectory. For retail investors, this trend offers a valuable lesson in maintaining a long-term perspective, even amid market turbulence.

37541790,https://finbold.com/?p=218871,1734004007,Nvidia (NVDA) is 35% better investment than Bitcoin in 2024 despite BTC price rally,"In 2024, Bitcoin ( BTC ) recorded triple-digit gains and even breached the long-awaited milestone price of $100,000 in early December. Despite BTC’s significant rise throughout the year, Finbold research found that the semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) delivered even higher returns than Bitcoin. An investment in Bitcoin made at the start of 2024 would have yielded a return of 139.72% by Thursday, December 12. In comparison, Nvidia stock would have appreciated 188.47% over the same period, making NVDA’s gains 1.35 times higher than BTC’s and offering a 35.7% greater return on investment (ROI). !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); Nvidia stock’s valuation grew 87% more than Bitcoin’s in 2024 The discrepancy between the two star investments is even more obvious once their respective market capitalizations are considered. Bitcoin’s valuation stood at approximately $830 billion at the beginning of the year, and it rose to almost exactly $2 trillion by press time. In total, BTC’s market cap rose by $1.17 trillion in 2024. Still, as impressive as the cryptocurrency’s rise is, Nvidia stock managed an even greater increase of $2.19 trillion, rising from $1.22 trillion at the start of January to $3.41 trillion on December 12. When did Bitcoin outperform NVDA stock? Furthermore, largely because the path of NVDA shares has been significantly more straightforward since 2022 —driven by the magnitude of the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom—the semiconductor giant has also proven to be a superior investment over longer time frames. For example, a January 2023 Nvidia investment would have grown 835%, while a similarly timed BTC investment would have risen 494%. The situation is similar with a purchase executed at the start of 2020, as NVDA stock is up 2,255.9% within the time frame, while BTC has surged 1,273.2%. However, an investment made in Bitcoin at the start of 2015 would have outperformed an Nvidia stock trade, as the cryptocurrency has rocketed 36,000% since then and the chipmaker 27,000%. Finally, though one might expect dividends to increase NVDA shares’ advantage as an investment, given that Bitcoin offers no such benefits, the semiconductor giant’s yield is so trivial at 0.029% that it hardly alters the total return on investment —a $1,000 investment made at the start of 2024 would have yielded less than $1 in dividend payouts.

37541804,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109329,1734003963,CryptoQuant CEO Expects Small Bitcoin Corrections During This Bull Market Cycle,"CryptoQuant CEO Expects Small Bitcoin Corrections During This Bull Market Cycle Ki-Young Ju, CEO of the prominent cryptocurrency analytics platform CryptoQuant, has shared insights on the current Bitcoin bull market cycle. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Ju predicted that Bitcoin price corrections would be relatively small throughout this cycle. He attributed this to consistent buying activity by spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers and institutional investors. A Bull Market Unlike Any Other The ongoing Bitcoin bull market has already captured global attention, with its price breaking historic thresholds earlier this year. While previous cycles have been characterized by sharp corrections and volatility, Ju’s analysis suggests a smoother trajectory for Bitcoin prices this time around. Ju pointed to the role of institutional players and spot Bitcoin ETFs in stabilizing the market. According to him, these entities are creating a “buying floor,” preventing drastic price drops even when Bitcoin experiences minor pullbacks. Spot Bitcoin ETFs: A Game Changer The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs has been a monumental development in the cryptocurrency space. Unlike futures-based ETFs, spot Bitcoin ETFs require issuers to directly hold Bitcoin, creating consistent buying pressure on the market. Ju emphasized how this buying activity acts as a stabilizing force, reducing the severity of corrections during bullish cycles. With several major financial institutions, including BlackRock and Fidelity, entering the Bitcoin ETF space, the demand for Bitcoin has seen a significant uptick. Institutional Buying Drives Market Stability Institutional investors have emerged as a key player in the cryptocurrency market, with their participation bringing increased liquidity and stability. Ju noted that these investors are not only buying Bitcoin for speculative purposes but also for long-term holdings, further reducing market volatility. This shift in market dynamics marks a stark contrast to earlier bull markets, where retail investors dominated trading activity, often amplifying volatility with their reactive behavior. What Are Bitcoin Corrections? In financial markets, a correction refers to a temporary price decline during an overall uptrend. These are often necessary for healthy market growth, as they allow overbought conditions to reset and provide opportunities for new investors to enter the market. In previous bull cycles, Bitcoin corrections have ranged from 20% to 40%, creating significant challenges for traders. However, Ju’s analysis suggests that corrections during this cycle may be much smaller, potentially ranging between 5% and 10%. The Role of On-Chain Metrics CryptoQuant’s data-driven approach provides valuable insights into Bitcoin’s price movements. Ju pointed out several key on-chain metrics supporting his prediction, including: Exchange Outflows : A steady decline in Bitcoin reserves on exchanges indicates that investors are moving their holdings to private wallets for long-term storage. Accumulation Trends : Institutional wallets and high-net-worth individuals have been consistently accumulating Bitcoin, suggesting strong conviction in the asset’s future performance. Reduced Leverage : Compared to previous cycles, the current market shows lower levels of leverage, which reduces the likelihood of sharp liquidations and cascading price drops. A Shift in Market Psychology The growing presence of institutional players and ETFs has also influenced market sentiment. Retail investors, often driven by fear and greed, are now taking cues from institutional behavior, adopting a more measured approach to trading. Ju’s insights highlight how this shift in market psychology contributes to reduced volatility, as fewer investors are engaging in panic selling during minor price dips. Historical Comparisons and Future Expectations Comparing this bull market cycle to previous ones reveals key differences. The 2017 and 2021 bull markets were marked by parabolic rises followed by sharp corrections, fueled by speculative activity and limited institutional involvement. In contrast, the 2024 bull market appears to be driven by sustained demand from ETFs and institutions. This consistent buying pressure not only reduces the size of corrections but also creates a more sustainable growth trajectory for Bitcoin. Potential Risks to Watch While Ju’s analysis paints an optimistic picture, potential risks could still disrupt the market: Regulatory Challenges : Ongoing scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry by global regulators could impact institutional participation. Macro-Economic Factors : Geopolitical tensions, interest rate changes, and economic downturns could influence market sentiment.

37541694,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109333,1734003794,Pantera Capital Executive: Crypto Investing to Become More Fundamentals-Oriented as Market Matures,"Pantera Capital Executive: Crypto Investing to Become More Fundamentals-Oriented as Market Matures Cosmo Jiang, portfolio manager at the cryptocurrency venture capital firm Pantera Capital, has shared transformative insights into the future of cryptocurrency investing. Speaking with CoinDesk, Jiang emphasized that as the crypto market evolves, it will shift towards a fundamentals-driven approach, aligning more closely with traditional financial markets. The move, he noted, is inevitable as institutional investors become more engaged, fostering sustainable growth in an asset class that has already achieved a $3.4 trillion market cap largely due to retail enthusiasm. The Rise of Fundamentals in Cryptocurrency Investing Jiang’s prediction signals a significant change in the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. Historically, retail investors have driven much of the volatility and speculation in the space, focusing on short-term gains rather than the underlying value of projects. However, as the market matures, the emphasis is shifting towards evaluating cryptocurrencies based on their technology, adoption rates, and real-world utility. Jiang pointed out that institutional investors demand a more structured and analytical approach to investments, requiring clear metrics and sound fundamentals. This transition is expected to stabilize the market and attract significant capital from traditional financial players, ensuring long-term sustainability and growth. Ethereum vs. Solana: A Competitive Landscape Jiang also highlighted the ongoing competition between Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), two of the leading blockchain platforms. While Ethereum has long dominated the decentralized application (dApp) ecosystem, it has been losing market share to faster and more scalable alternatives like Solana. Ethereum’s Challenges : Higher transaction fees and slower processing speeds have made Ethereum less appealing to some developers and users. Its transition to Ethereum 2.0, while promising, is a complex and lengthy process, leaving room for competitors to capitalize. Solana’s Advantages : Jiang emphasized Solana’s superior user interface and technical advantages in supporting meme coins and decentralized exchanges (DEX). Its low fees and high throughput have attracted developers looking for efficient solutions, giving it a significant edge in certain niches. Altcoins: The Next Wave of Growth Jiang believes that altcoins are poised for substantial growth, especially as blockchain adoption accelerates under favorable policies. He noted that if the Trump administration increases blockchain adoption as anticipated, altcoins could experience a boom far greater than Bitcoin. While Bitcoin remains the flagship cryptocurrency and a digital gold equivalent, altcoins are carving out their niches in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and enterprise solutions. Projects with strong fundamentals and clear use cases will likely lead this growth, making them attractive targets for institutional investors. Institutional Adoption: The Key to Sustained Growth Institutional investors are expected to play a pivotal role in the next phase of cryptocurrency growth. According to Jiang, their involvement will not only bring more capital into the market but also encourage the development of regulatory frameworks that protect investors and reduce market manipulation. He argued that institutional interest would naturally lead to greater scrutiny of projects, forcing teams to focus on delivering measurable value. This evolution will create a more robust and credible market, paving the way for cryptocurrencies to integrate further into the global financial system. Retail Investors: Adapting to the New Normal While institutional involvement is crucial, retail investors will need to adapt to a market that is less driven by hype and more by fundamentals. Jiang advised retail participants to: Focus on projects with strong development teams and clear roadmaps. Avoid speculative tokens that lack tangible use cases. Leverage educational resources to understand the evolving dynamics of the market. Blockchain Adoption: A Catalyst for Altcoin Growth The expected increase in blockchain adoption under favorable governmental policies could significantly benefit altcoins. Jiang highlighted how such policies would incentivize innovation and create opportunities for blockchain projects to address real-world challenges. With altcoins already demonstrating strength in areas like gaming, supply chain management, and decentralized identity, this adoption could unlock new avenues for growth, further diversifying the cryptocurrency landscape. The Debate Over Bitcoin’s Role While Jiang remains optimistic about the future of altcoins, he also acknowledged Bitcoin’s foundational role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As a store of value and a hedge against inflation, Bitcoin continues to attract interest from both retail and institutional investors. However, its dominance is gradually declining as more specialized blockchain projects address specific industry needs, providing tailored solutions that Bitcoin cannot offer. Conclusion The cryptocurrency market is entering a pivotal phase in its evolution, with institutional investors driving a shift towards fundamentals-oriented investing. As this transition unfolds, projects with strong use cases, innovative technology, and clear value propositions are likely to thrive. Ethereum and Solana exemplify the dynamic nature of the market, with competition spurring innovation and growth. Meanwhile, the increasing adoption of blockchain technology under supportive policies could catalyze a new wave of altcoin dominance. For investors, the message is clear: the future of cryptocurrency lies in fundamentals. Understanding the intrinsic value of projects will be key to navigating this transformative era and capitalizing on the opportunities it presents.

37541640,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109335,1734003708,Stablecoin Market Hits $200B Record,"Stablecoin Market Hits $200B Record The stablecoin market has achieved a historic milestone, surpassing $200 billion in market value. This growth is fueled by an explosion in crypto trading, payments, and yield-generating products, according to data from CCData and DefiLlama. Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC lead the charge, with a combined market share of over 90%. Analysts foresee continued growth, predicting the market could double to $400 billion by 2025, driven by favorable U.S. legislation and increased fintech adoption. What Are Stablecoins? Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value by pegging their price to a reserve asset, such as the U.S. dollar, euro, or even commodities like gold. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, stablecoins offer price stability, making them an attractive option for trading, payments, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Leading stablecoins such as Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), and Binance USD (BUSD) play a pivotal role in the crypto ecosystem by providing liquidity and acting as a bridge between fiat and digital currencies. Tether (USDT) Leads the Stablecoin Market According to the latest data, Tether’s USDT remains the dominant player in the stablecoin market, with a circulating supply of $139 billion. USDT’s wide adoption across centralized and decentralized exchanges has solidified its position as the go-to stablecoin for crypto traders and investors. Tether’s growth is fueled by: High Liquidity : USDT is widely used for trading pairs across most crypto exchanges. Global Accessibility : Its availability on various blockchains ensures seamless integration across platforms. DeFi Integration : USDT is a key component of DeFi protocols, powering lending, borrowing, and yield farming. USD Coin (USDC): A Close Contender Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) ranks second, with a market capitalization of $41 billion. While smaller than Tether, USDC is preferred by institutions due to its transparent reserve disclosures and regulatory compliance. USDC’s strengths include: Regulatory Oversight : Circle collaborates closely with U.S. regulators, making USDC a trusted stablecoin for institutions. Programmable Finance : Its integration with Ethereum and other blockchains supports smart contract applications. Adoption in Fintech : Partnerships with major fintech companies enhance USDC’s utility in mainstream financial services. Key Drivers of Stablecoin Growth Several factors contribute to the stablecoin market’s unprecedented growth: Crypto Trading : Stablecoins are essential for trading pairs, offering a stable store of value during market volatility. Payments and Remittances : Their low transaction fees and fast processing make stablecoins ideal for cross-border payments. DeFi Expansion : Stablecoins power lending, borrowing, and staking protocols, attracting users seeking high yields. Institutional Adoption : Corporations and fintech firms are increasingly integrating stablecoins into their payment systems. Analysts Predict $400B Market by 2025 Industry experts predict the stablecoin market could double to $400 billion by 2025. This growth will likely be driven by two major factors: U.S. Legislation : The potential passage of stablecoin-specific regulations in the United States could provide clarity and encourage institutional participation. Fintech Integration : Partnerships between stablecoin issuers and financial technology companies will expand use cases beyond the crypto ecosystem. The adoption of stablecoins for payroll, e-commerce, and international remittances is expected to accelerate as mainstream financial institutions embrace blockchain technology. Challenges Facing the Stablecoin Market Despite its rapid growth, the stablecoin market faces several challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty : Global regulatory scrutiny remains a hurdle for stablecoin issuers, particularly around reserve transparency and systemic risks. Competition from CBDCs : Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could challenge the dominance of private stablecoins. Decentralization Concerns : Critics argue that centralized stablecoins like USDT and USDC compromise the decentralized ethos of blockchain technology. The Role of Emerging Stablecoins While USDT and USDC dominate, other stablecoins like Binance USD (BUSD), Dai (DAI), and TrueUSD (TUSD) are gaining traction. Decentralized stablecoins like DAI, which maintain stability through algorithmic mechanisms rather than fiat reserves, are particularly appealing to DeFi enthusiasts. Additionally, newer entrants focused on regional markets or niche applications could further diversify the stablecoin ecosystem, driving innovation and competition. Conclusion The stablecoin market’s rise to $200 billion marks a significant milestone, showcasing the increasing importance of these assets in the cryptocurrency landscape. Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC lead the charge, underpinned by their utility in trading, payments, and DeFi applications. As analysts forecast a $400 billion market by 2025, the continued growth of stablecoins will depend on regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, and innovative use cases. Despite challenges, stablecoins remain a cornerstone of the crypto industry, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the blockchain-based future.

The data, shared by Arkham Intelligence on X (formerly Twitter), underscores the growing institutional interest in Ethereum as blockchain technology continues to reshape the financial landscape. This massive purchase represents a significant vote of confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential, particularly as the blockchain solidifies its role as the backbone for decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and an expanding DeFi ecosystem. Ethereum: The Institutional Magnet Ethereum has evolved into more than just a cryptocurrency.

37541592,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109343,1734003613,0.55% of Microsoft Shareholders Support Bitcoin Proposal,"0.55% of Microsoft Shareholders Support Bitcoin Proposal Microsoft shareholders have overwhelmingly voted against a proposal to incorporate Bitcoin into the company’s investment strategy. According to a report by Watcher Guru on X (formerly Twitter), only 0.55% of shareholders supported the initiative. The company’s board had previously dismissed the proposal, arguing that Bitcoin investments were unnecessary due to Microsoft’s existing diversified strategies and concerns about cryptocurrency volatility. The Proposal: A Bold Move for Bitcoin The proposal aimed to encourage Microsoft to consider Bitcoin as part of its asset diversification strategy. Advocates of the move highlighted Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against inflation and its increasing adoption by institutional investors. Despite these arguments, the Microsoft board took a firm stance against the proposal, emphasizing that the company already employs a well-rounded approach to asset management. Additionally, the board cited the risks associated with Bitcoin’s price volatility and regulatory uncertainties as significant reasons for rejecting the idea. Shareholder Support: A Fractional Minority The 0.55% vote in favor of the proposal represents a small minority of Microsoft shareholders. This result reflects limited support for integrating cryptocurrency investments into the tech giant’s financial strategy. Several factors likely contributed to the low level of support: Conservative Investment Approach : Microsoft’s board has consistently prioritized stability and risk mitigation, favoring traditional investment vehicles. Cryptocurrency Volatility : Bitcoin’s price fluctuations make it a less predictable and reliable asset for corporate balance sheets. Lack of Institutional Consensus : While some companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have embraced Bitcoin, most large corporations remain cautious. Microsoft’s Stance on Bitcoin Microsoft’s rejection of the Bitcoin proposal is aligned with its broader strategy of conservative financial management. The company has historically avoided speculative investments, focusing instead on long-term growth through innovation, acquisitions, and traditional asset allocation. In its response to the proposal, the board reiterated its commitment to exploring diverse investment options while ensuring stability and alignment with the company’s goals. The statement emphasized that the volatility of Bitcoin made it unsuitable for inclusion in the corporate treasury. Bitcoin in the Corporate World: A Divisive Topic The debate over Bitcoin’s role in corporate finance continues to divide opinions. Proponents argue that Bitcoin represents a revolutionary asset class with the potential to outperform traditional investments in the long term. Critics, however, point to its unpredictable price swings and regulatory uncertainties as major drawbacks. Companies Embracing Bitcoin : MicroStrategy is a notable example, holding over 150,000 BTC as part of its treasury strategy. Tesla has also invested in Bitcoin, although its involvement has been met with mixed results. Companies Avoiding Bitcoin : Many corporations, including Microsoft, remain on the sidelines, opting for traditional assets and focusing on stability. The Broader Implications of the Vote Microsoft’s decision to reject the Bitcoin proposal highlights the challenges cryptocurrencies face in gaining widespread acceptance among traditional corporations. The lack of shareholder support reflects broader hesitancy in the corporate world to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury asset. However, it also underscores the evolving narrative around cryptocurrencies. While adoption remains limited among large companies, institutional interest in Bitcoin continues to grow, driven by innovations such as Bitcoin ETFs and increasing regulatory clarity in certain jurisdictions. What This Means for Bitcoin Advocacy The low level of support for the proposal serves as a setback for Bitcoin advocates pushing for mainstream adoption. However, it also provides valuable lessons: Education Is Key : Increasing awareness about Bitcoin’s benefits and addressing misconceptions could lead to greater acceptance. Proving Stability : Demonstrating Bitcoin’s ability to maintain value over time is essential to convincing conservative investors. Navigating Regulation : Clear regulatory frameworks will play a crucial role in easing corporate concerns about adopting cryptocurrencies. Conclusion The 0.55% shareholder support for Microsoft’s Bitcoin investment proposal highlights the significant hurdles cryptocurrencies face in achieving mainstream corporate adoption. While Bitcoin proponents like Michael Saylor continue to advocate for its inclusion in corporate treasuries, most large companies remain cautious, prioritizing stability over speculation. Microsoft’s decision underscores the need for further dialogue and education about Bitcoin’s potential role in diversifying corporate investments. As the cryptocurrency market matures and regulatory frameworks develop, the conversation around Bitcoin in the corporate world is far from over.

37541523,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109345,1734003519,Tom Lee: Bitcoin Going to $250K by 2025,"Tom Lee: Bitcoin Going to $250K by 2025 Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, is once again in the spotlight after Tom Lee, founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, forecasted a meteoric rise to $250,000 by 2025. Speaking in an interview with CNBC, Lee attributed his bullish outlook to growing support for cryptocurrencies from the U.S. government, as well as increasing institutional adoption and market maturity. This prediction underscores Bitcoin’s potential to disrupt traditional financial systems while solidifying its status as digital gold in a rapidly evolving economic landscape. White House Support Fuels Optimism Tom Lee’s forecast comes at a time when the White House has openly embraced cryptocurrencies. Recent policy initiatives have focused on creating a regulatory framework to support blockchain innovation while protecting investors. This government backing has significantly boosted confidence among institutional investors, who see regulatory clarity as a green light to increase their exposure to Bitcoin and other digital assets. Bitcoin’s Path to $250K: Key Drivers Several factors support Lee’s optimistic prediction for Bitcoin’s price trajectory: Institutional Adoption Institutional interest in Bitcoin has surged, with companies like BlackRock and Fidelity recently making substantial investments in the cryptocurrency. This influx of institutional capital provides stability and long-term growth potential. Scarcity and Supply Constraints Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins ensures scarcity, making it a deflationary asset. With more investors accumulating Bitcoin, the reduced supply on exchanges creates upward pressure on prices. Macroeconomic Environment Rising inflation and geopolitical instability have positioned Bitcoin as a hedge against traditional financial risks. Its decentralized nature and global appeal make it an attractive alternative to fiat currencies. Blockchain Advancements Ongoing developments in Bitcoin’s ecosystem, including scaling solutions like the Lightning Network, are enhancing its usability and adoption as a medium of exchange. Retail and Fintech Integration Increased adoption by fintech companies and payment platforms has made Bitcoin more accessible to retail investors, further driving demand. Historical Trends and Market Dynamics Lee’s prediction aligns with Bitcoin’s historical performance in bull markets. Bitcoin’s price tends to move in cycles, with significant growth following periods of consolidation. In 2017, Bitcoin reached nearly $20,000, driven by retail speculation. In 2021, it surpassed $68,000 as institutional interest surged. By 2024, the market shows signs of maturation, paving the way for higher price targets. If these patterns continue, Bitcoin’s ascent to $250,000 by 2025 could follow a similar trajectory, fueled by macroeconomic shifts and increased adoption. Regulatory Clarity: A Game Changer One of the most significant factors influencing Bitcoin’s future is regulatory clarity. The Biden administration’s efforts to create a comprehensive framework for digital assets have provided a foundation for mainstream acceptance. Lee believes that as governments worldwide adopt pro-crypto policies, Bitcoin will become an integral part of the global financial system, driving its price to unprecedented levels. Challenges and Risks While the outlook is optimistic, Bitcoin faces challenges that could impact its trajectory: Regulatory Uncertainty : Although progress has been made, potential policy changes could disrupt market dynamics. Market Volatility : Bitcoin’s price remains highly volatile, which could deter risk-averse investors. Technological Competition : Emerging blockchain projects could compete for market share, affecting Bitcoin’s dominance. The Road to $250K: Investor Takeaways For investors considering Bitcoin, Lee’s prediction offers a compelling case for long-term investment. Key strategies include: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) : Gradually accumulating Bitcoin to mitigate the impact of price volatility. Diversification : Balancing Bitcoin with other asset classes to manage risk. Education : Staying informed about market trends and regulatory developments. Conclusion Tom Lee’s bold forecast of Bitcoin reaching $250,000 by 2025 reflects the growing confidence in the cryptocurrency’s role in the global economy. With institutional adoption, government support, and technological advancements driving momentum, Bitcoin appears poised for significant growth. While risks remain, the alignment of market dynamics and macroeconomic factors makes Bitcoin an increasingly attractive investment for both retail and institutional players.

37541521,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109347,1734003435,U.S. Supreme Court Rejects Nvidia Appeal Over Crypto Mining Profits,"U.S. Supreme Court Rejects Nvidia Appeal Over Crypto Mining Profits The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to hear Nvidia’s appeal in a long-standing shareholder lawsuit alleging the company concealed profits from cryptocurrency mining activities. The rejection allows the lawsuit, originally filed in 2019, to move forward, marking a significant development in the ongoing legal battle. The case revolves around allegations that Nvidia understated the impact of cryptocurrency mining on its revenues during 2017 and 2018, a period when demand for GPUs (graphics processing units) surged due to the crypto boom. Shareholders claim that the company’s actions misled investors and caused increased volatility in Nvidia’s stock price. Background of the Nvidia Lawsuit In the lawsuit, plaintiffs accuse Nvidia of deliberately hiding the extent of its revenue derived from cryptocurrency miners, who used the company’s GPUs to power mining operations. According to the allegations, Nvidia’s failure to disclose this information misrepresented its revenue streams, leading investors to believe that its growth was driven primarily by the gaming market. The lawsuit argues that when the crypto market crashed in 2018, demand for GPUs from miners plummeted, exposing Nvidia to financial risks that were not adequately disclosed. This led to a sharp decline in the company’s stock value, leaving investors with significant losses. Nvidia’s Defense and Appeal Nvidia has maintained that the lawsuit lacks merit, arguing that the plaintiffs have not provided sufficient evidence to substantiate their claims. The company contends that its financial disclosures were accurate and complied with regulatory requirements. In its appeal to the Supreme Court, Nvidia sought to dismiss the lawsuit before it could advance to the discovery phase, which involves gathering evidence and testimony. Nvidia argued that allowing the case to proceed would impose undue burdens on the company and set a problematic precedent for shareholder litigation. Supreme Court’s Decision By rejecting Nvidia’s appeal, the Supreme Court has effectively allowed the lawsuit to move forward in lower courts. This decision means the plaintiffs can now pursue evidence to support their allegations, including internal documents and communications from Nvidia. While the Supreme Court’s refusal to hear the case does not imply guilt or wrongdoing, it represents a setback for Nvidia, which had hoped to avoid a prolonged legal battle. The Role of Cryptocurrency Mining in Nvidia’s Business During the cryptocurrency boom of 2017 and 2018, demand for Nvidia’s GPUs skyrocketed as miners sought powerful hardware to maximize their profits. GPUs, designed for gaming and graphical applications, proved to be highly efficient for mining cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. This surge in demand significantly boosted Nvidia’s revenues, but it also created challenges: Market Volatility : The volatile nature of cryptocurrency prices led to unpredictable swings in GPU demand. Stock Risks : Nvidia’s reliance on miners for revenue exposed the company to risks when the crypto market cooled. Transparency Issues : Critics argue that Nvidia failed to provide clear information about the proportion of its revenue linked to crypto mining. Impact on the Cryptocurrency Market The lawsuit also highlights the broader implications of GPU demand on the cryptocurrency market. During the 2017–2018 crypto boom, the surge in GPU prices made mining less accessible to smaller players, centralizing operations among large-scale miners. When the market corrected in 2018, it caused a ripple effect, reducing mining activity and impacting companies like Nvidia that were heavily involved in supplying hardware to the industry. Investor Implications The Nvidia case underscores the importance of transparency in corporate financial reporting, particularly for companies operating in volatile and emerging industries like cryptocurrency. Shareholders argue that clearer disclosures could have mitigated their losses by providing a more accurate picture of Nvidia’s revenue streams and risk exposure. Potential Outcomes of the Lawsuit If the lawsuit advances to trial and the plaintiffs succeed, Nvidia could face: Financial Penalties : Potential damages paid to shareholders to compensate for losses. Reputational Damage : Negative publicity could affect Nvidia’s standing with investors and partners. Stricter Oversight : Regulatory bodies may impose additional compliance requirements to prevent similar issues in the future. Alternatively, a settlement could be reached before the case goes to trial, allowing Nvidia to resolve the matter without admitting wrongdoing. Conclusion The U.S. Supreme Court’s rejection of Nvidia’s appeal marks a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency mining profits case. As the lawsuit proceeds, it will shed light on the relationship between tech companies and the crypto industry, as well as the importance of transparency in financial reporting. For Nvidia, the case serves as a cautionary tale about the risks of operating in volatile markets without clear disclosures. For investors, it highlights the need for diligence and accountability when navigating the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape.

37541474,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109352,1734003356,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Rises to 83, Entering ‘Extreme Greed’ Zone","Crypto Fear & Greed Index Rises to 83, Entering ‘Extreme Greed’ Zone The cryptocurrency market is surging with optimism as the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reaches 83, moving firmly into the “Extreme Greed” zone. Provided by Alternative, this key sentiment indicator reflects the growing confidence among traders and investors in the crypto market. The nine-point rise from the previous day signals heightened bullish sentiment, but also raises questions about potential market volatility. What Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a widely used tool to gauge market sentiment. It assigns a score between 0 and 100, where: 0 to 24 indicates “Extreme Fear,” often associated with undervalued markets. 25 to 49 reflects “Fear,” suggesting cautious sentiment. 50 to 74 signifies “Greed,” indicating rising optimism. 75 to 100 denotes “Extreme Greed,” which can point to overbought conditions. The index incorporates six weighted factors to capture the market’s mood: Volatility (25%) : Measures price swings and compares current volatility to historical averages. Market Momentum/Volume (25%) : Tracks trading volume and momentum, reflecting investor confidence. Social Media (15%) : Monitors crypto-related activity and sentiment on platforms like Twitter. Surveys (15%) : Collects data from market participants (temporarily paused by Alternative). Bitcoin Dominance (10%) : Evaluates Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market cap. Google Trends (10%) : Analyzes search trends for Bitcoin and other crypto-related terms. What Does an ‘Extreme Greed’ Score Mean? A score of 83 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index places the market in the “Extreme Greed” zone, signaling strong positive sentiment. This level of optimism often indicates that investors are highly confident in the market’s upward trajectory. However, it can also serve as a warning. Historically, extreme greed has preceded market corrections, as overconfidence may lead to overbought conditions. Key Factors Driving the Current Sentiment Improved Market Conditions The rise in the index is partly driven by strong price momentum in leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Increased trading volumes reflect renewed interest from both retail and institutional investors. Positive News Cycle Recent developments, such as BlackRock and Fidelity’s substantial Ethereum purchases and regulatory clarity from the U.S. government, have contributed to the market’s bullish outlook. Rising Bitcoin Dominance Bitcoin dominance, a component of the index, has increased as the leading cryptocurrency maintains its position as a store of value amid rising adoption. Google Trends and Social Media Activity A surge in searches for cryptocurrency-related terms and high activity on platforms like Twitter suggest growing public interest in digital assets. Implications of the Extreme Greed Zone Entering the “Extreme Greed” zone has both positive and cautionary implications for the cryptocurrency market. Positives : Reflects strong market momentum and confidence. Indicates potential for short-term gains as new capital flows into the market. Risks : Suggests possible overvaluation, increasing the likelihood of a market correction. Heightens vulnerability to sudden negative news, which could trigger sell-offs. How Traders Can Use the Fear & Greed Index The Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool for traders and investors, offering insights into market sentiment and potential turning points. During Extreme Greed : Investors may consider taking profits or reallocating funds to less volatile assets. During Extreme Fear : Contrarian traders often view this as a buying opportunity, betting on market recovery. Historical Context The index has proven to be a reliable indicator of market sentiment during major cryptocurrency cycles: In 2021, the index hit “Extreme Greed” multiple times as Bitcoin reached all-time highs above $68,000, followed by significant corrections. During the 2022 bear market, “Extreme Fear” dominated as prices plummeted, offering lucrative entry points for long-term investors. What’s Next for the Crypto Market? The current reading of 83 reflects strong confidence, but investors should remain cautious. Key factors to watch include: Market Volatility : High sentiment scores often precede price swings. Institutional Activity : Continued buying by major players could support the rally. Macroeconomic Conditions : Factors like inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical events could influence sentiment. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s rise to 83 marks a period of heightened optimism in the cryptocurrency market. While the “Extreme Greed” zone signals strong momentum, it also warrants caution as markets may be overextended. For traders and investors, balancing short-term opportunities with risk management is essential. As the market continues to evolve, tools like the Fear & Greed Index provide valuable insights into sentiment dynamics, helping navigate the complexities of cryptocurrency investing.

37541473,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109356,1734003292,Cryptocurrency Fund Advertisement Appears on China’s Alipay Homepage,"Cryptocurrency Fund Advertisement Appears on China’s Alipay Homepage China’s financial landscape took an intriguing turn as Alipay, the country’s leading digital payment platform, displayed an advertisement for a cryptocurrency investment fund on its homepage. Renowned crypto journalist Colin Wu reported on X (formerly Twitter) that the advertisement promoted the Hwabao WP Overseas Science and Technology Equity Fund (QDII-FOF-LOF) , a fund that primarily invests in Coinbase stock and Bitcoin ETFs. This move by Alipay, a subsidiary of Ant Group, raises eyebrows in a nation that has maintained a stringent stance on cryptocurrency trading and mining in recent years. Hwabao WP Fund: A Blend of Traditional and Digital Investments The featured fund, Hwabao WP Overseas Science and Technology Equity Fund, represents a hybrid investment approach. While it does not directly invest in cryptocurrencies, its portfolio includes: Coinbase Stock : Shares in one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, reflecting confidence in the infrastructure supporting digital assets. Bitcoin ETFs : Indirect exposure to Bitcoin through exchange-traded funds, offering a regulated avenue for crypto investments. This indirect involvement in cryptocurrency assets positions the fund as a bridge between traditional finance and the burgeoning digital economy, catering to investors who are wary of direct exposure to volatile crypto markets. Alipay’s Move: A Subtle Shift in Narrative? Alipay’s decision to feature a cryptocurrency-related fund is noteworthy given China’s stringent crypto regulations. In recent years, the Chinese government has banned cryptocurrency trading, mining, and initial coin offerings (ICOs), citing concerns over financial stability and illegal activities. However, the promotion of a fund with indirect crypto exposure could indicate a softening stance or an attempt to explore the potential of blockchain technology and digital assets within a controlled framework. China’s Relationship with Cryptocurrency China’s stance on cryptocurrencies has been complex and multifaceted: Crackdown on Crypto Trading and Mining : The government’s bans aimed to curb financial risks and energy consumption. Development of the Digital Yuan : China has heavily invested in its central bank digital currency (CBDC), which serves as a state-controlled alternative to decentralized cryptocurrencies. Interest in Blockchain : Despite its restrictions on crypto, China has encouraged the adoption of blockchain technology across industries. Implications of Alipay’s Cryptocurrency Fund Advertisement The appearance of a cryptocurrency fund ad on Alipay’s homepage could have several implications: Mainstream Adoption Featuring a crypto-related fund on such a prominent platform signals growing acceptance of digital assets as part of diversified investment portfolios. Education and Awareness The advertisement introduces crypto investment opportunities to Alipay’s vast user base, many of whom may have limited knowledge of the digital asset space. A Step Toward Global Alignment By promoting investments linked to Coinbase and Bitcoin ETFs, Alipay aligns itself with international financial trends, signaling a shift in China’s approach to cryptocurrency. Global Context: Rising Institutional Interest in Crypto Alipay’s move coincides with growing institutional adoption of cryptocurrency worldwide. Major players like BlackRock and Fidelity are integrating digital assets into their portfolios, while Bitcoin ETFs are gaining traction in regulated markets. China’s careful exploration of indirect crypto investments mirrors a broader trend of balancing innovation with regulation, ensuring that the benefits of blockchain and digital assets can be harnessed without destabilizing the economy. Investor Takeaways For investors, the promotion of the Hwabao WP fund offers insights into emerging opportunities: Indirect Crypto Exposure : Funds like Hwabao WP provide a safer entry point for investors hesitant about direct cryptocurrency investments. Diverse Portfolios : By including stocks like Coinbase and Bitcoin ETFs, the fund offers a balanced approach to high-growth sectors. Evolving Narratives : Alipay’s endorsement could indicate a gradual shift in China’s stance on crypto-related financial products. Challenges and Risks Despite its promise, the move raises several questions and challenges: Regulatory Risks : China’s strict regulations on cryptocurrency trading may limit the fund’s accessibility to domestic investors. Market Volatility : Indirect crypto investments remain exposed to the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Public Perception : The ad may face scrutiny from a public and government wary of crypto’s risks. Conclusion Alipay’s promotion of a cryptocurrency-related fund on its homepage marks a significant moment in China’s financial landscape. While the fund does not directly invest in digital currencies, its inclusion of Coinbase stock and Bitcoin ETFs reflects the growing influence of cryptocurrencies in global markets. As China continues to navigate its complex relationship with digital assets, Alipay’s move could serve as a stepping stone toward greater integration of blockchain and cryptocurrency into the nation’s financial ecosystem. For investors, it signals an evolving narrative that balances innovation with caution, offering new opportunities in the dynamic world of digital finance.

Mayor Ken Sim, an outspoken advocate for Bitcoin, believes this move could inspire other regions to follow suit, further solidifying Vancouver’s status as an innovation hub. A Vision for a Bitcoin-Friendly Vancouver Mayor Sim has been vocal about his admiration for Bitcoin, calling it “the greatest invention ever in human history.” In November, he proposed adding Bitcoin to Vancouver’s balance sheet as part of a broader strategy to integrate cryptocurrency into the city’s financial ecosystem. The motion aims to: Evaluate Bitcoin for Municipal Finances : Explore using Bitcoin for city treasury reserves and transactions.

Regulatory Frameworks : Canada’s relatively clear crypto regulations encourage investment and entrepreneurship. Mining Industry : Canada’s access to renewable energy has made it a hotspot for Bitcoin mining operations. Tech Ecosystem : Cities like Toronto and Vancouver are home to vibrant tech communities, supporting blockchain startups. Vancouver’s Potential Influence By declaring itself Bitcoin-friendly, Vancouver may inspire other municipalities to explore cryptocurrency adoption. This could lead to: Increased Investment : Businesses and startups may flock to cities that embrace Bitcoin.

According to Ricardo Petersen, Coinbase’s Latin American lead, the platform has also secured a spot among the top three finance apps overall, underscoring its growing influence in the region’s financial ecosystem. This achievement highlights Brazil’s increasing interest in cryptocurrencies and Coinbase’s expanding footprint in Latin America, a region ripe with opportunities for digital financial services. Coinbase’s Rise in Brazil Brazil, the largest economy in Latin America, has witnessed a surge in cryptocurrency adoption in recent years. As economic uncertainties and inflation drive demand for alternative assets, digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained traction among Brazilians.

By focusing on user education, seamless user experiences, and partnerships with local financial institutions, Coinbase aims to position itself as the go-to platform for cryptocurrency investments in the region. Competition Among Finance Apps Joining the ranks of Brazil’s top three finance apps places Coinbase in direct competition with well-established players in the financial sector.

Competition : Established fintechs and other crypto platforms are vying for dominance in the region. Economic Volatility : While Brazil’s economic conditions drive crypto adoption, they also pose risks to sustained user growth.

On Wednesday, the Solana price surged nearly 7%, reaching $232 after a two-week correction period that followed its current all-time high achievement of $263 on November 23. Could The Solana Price Soar To $4,000? The recent price action suggests that Solana may be on track to not only retest its previous peak but potentially exceed it significantly. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted a bullish “cup and handle” pattern forming on Solana’s one-month chart, indicating the potential for a remarkable uptrend. Martinez forecasts that if this pattern plays out, Solana could see gains exceeding 1,650%, resulting in a new record price of $4,000 per token. Related Reading: XRP Price Defies Bearish Crypto Trend, Rallies 6%: Key Drivers Revealed However, perspectives among analysts vary regarding the future trajectory of Solana. While some, like Cryptorangutan, emphasize the current momentum indicators and established buying pressure, predicting a surge toward the $300 mark, others urge caution. Analyst MoreCryptoonl on the other hand, points out a completed pullback structure, indicating a clear five-wave move downward. This analysis suggests that while the recovery rally is underway, it remains uncertain whether it will develop into a bullish pattern or an ABC corrective structure. Total Value Locked Hits $9.198 Billion Despite the mixed technical signals, key financial metrics paint a largely positive picture for Solana. According to CoinMarketCap, the market capitalization stands at approximately $112.73 billion, positioning Solana as the sixth-largest cryptocurrency. Additionally, its Total Value Locked (TVL) has reached $9.198 billion, reflecting continued interest in its decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. However, decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes have fallen by 25% to $28 billion, indicating some volatility in trading activity. The narrative surrounding Solana has been further fueled by recent developments in the market. Grayscale’s filing for a spot Solana ETF in the US has generated buzz, as the cryptocurrency community anticipates the potential for increased institutional investment. Additionally, the project Jupiter has revised its $1.6 billion airdrop after a failed vote, while the platform Pump.fun reported record revenue of $93 million for November, despite experiencing a 66% weekly drop.

Understanding Bitcoin’s Inflows Inflows represent the amount of money entering the Bitcoin market, reflecting new investments from retail and institutional participants. The $80 billion monthly inflow indicates heightened activity, driven by factors such as: Institutional Adoption : Companies like BlackRock and Fidelity have made substantial Bitcoin investments, signaling long-term confidence. Macro-Economic Factors : Inflation and economic uncertainties are prompting investors to seek Bitcoin as a hedge. Global Accessibility : Increased adoption of Bitcoin across countries is expanding its user base and driving liquidity. 2024: A Year of Milestones for Bitcoin The fact that nearly half of Bitcoin’s lifetime inflows have occurred in 2024 underscores the cryptocurrency’s meteoric rise this year.

His comment underscores the transformative potential of Bitcoin as more capital flows into its market, cementing its role in reshaping global finance. Why $80B Monthly Inflows Matter The massive inflows into Bitcoin this year reflect key shifts in the cryptocurrency’s adoption and utility: Increased Liquidity : Higher inflows improve market liquidity, making it easier for large transactions to occur without significant price impacts. Growing Trust : More capital entering the market signals increased confidence from both retail and institutional investors. Enhanced Stability : While Bitcoin remains volatile, increased investment from long-term holders helps reduce extreme price swings. The Role of Institutions Institutional investors have played a significant role in driving inflows. Firms such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and others have introduced Bitcoin-related products, legitimizing the asset class and attracting traditional investors. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs has also been a game-changer, providing a regulated and accessible way for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. This development has contributed significantly to the record-breaking inflows in 2024. Retail Investors Join the Surge While institutions lead the charge, retail investors are also contributing to the $80 billion monthly inflows. Factors like increased accessibility through user-friendly platforms, educational initiatives, and global interest in cryptocurrencies have encouraged individuals to participate. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Future? The record inflows suggest a bright future for Bitcoin as it continues to mature and integrate into the global financial system. Here’s what this could mean: Price Appreciation : Sustained inflows often correlate with upward price trends, particularly as demand outpaces supply. Mainstream Adoption : With more capital entering the market, Bitcoin is solidifying its role as a mainstream asset. Increased Utility : As adoption grows, Bitcoin’s use as both a store of value and a medium of exchange will likely expand. Challenges Ahead Despite the positive momentum, Bitcoin faces challenges that could impact future inflows: Regulatory Uncertainty : While some countries have embraced Bitcoin, others remain skeptical, posing potential hurdles. Market Volatility : Sudden price fluctuations could deter risk-averse investors. Competition : Emerging blockchain projects and technologies may divert attention and capital from Bitcoin.

According to data from Trader T on X (formerly Twitter) and Farside Investors, this marks the tenth consecutive day of inflows, signaling sustained investor confidence in Bitcoin-focused exchange-traded funds. Fidelity’s FBTC Leads the Pack Fidelity’s FBTC emerged as the top-performing ETF for the day, attracting $121.9 million in net inflows. This reflects strong institutional and retail interest in Fidelity’s Bitcoin offering, which has become a cornerstone for investors seeking exposure to the cryptocurrency market. Other notable inflows included: Ark Invest’s ARKB : $52.7 million Grayscale’s GBTC : $20.1 million Grayscale Mini BTC Trust : $15.7 million Bitwise’s BITB : $12.2 million VanEck’s HODL : $2.9 million Outflows Counterbalance Gains While the overall market saw net inflows, certain ETFs experienced outflows, including: Grayscale’s GBTC : $62.82 million Invesco’s BTCO : $11.56 million VanEck’s HODL : $5.45 million These outflows suggest selective reallocation of capital within the market, as investors weigh the performance and value propositions of various funds. 10 Days of Consecutive Inflows The $223.1 million inflow on December 11 extends the streak of positive net inflows to ten days, underscoring the growing appetite for Bitcoin among investors. This period has been marked by heightened activity in the spot Bitcoin ETF market, driven by factors such as: Rising Institutional Interest : Institutional investors are leveraging ETFs for regulated exposure to Bitcoin. Market Optimism : Positive sentiment surrounding Bitcoin’s price trajectory and regulatory clarity. Accessibility : Spot Bitcoin ETFs provide an easy entry point for retail investors unfamiliar with direct cryptocurrency purchases. Spot Bitcoin ETFs: A Game-Changer for the Market Spot Bitcoin ETFs have revolutionized access to Bitcoin by allowing investors to gain exposure without directly owning or managing the cryptocurrency. These funds are backed by actual Bitcoin holdings, providing transparency and trust. Key advantages include: Regulated Access : Spot ETFs operate under strict regulatory frameworks, ensuring investor protections. Ease of Use : Investors can trade Bitcoin ETFs like traditional equities, avoiding the complexities of managing private keys or wallets.

This dual activity could reflect investor repositioning as Grayscale continues its transition from a trust structure to an ETF model. Challenges Facing Spot Bitcoin ETFs Despite their growing popularity, spot Bitcoin ETFs face challenges, including: Regulatory Scrutiny : Continued oversight by regulatory bodies could influence market operations. Competition : With multiple ETFs in the market, funds must differentiate themselves to attract inflows. Market Volatility : Bitcoin’s price fluctuations can impact fund performance and investor sentiment. What This Means for Bitcoin’s Market Dynamics The sustained inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs are a positive signal for Bitcoin’s broader adoption and price stability. Increased participation by institutional and retail investors enhances liquidity and market confidence. However, the observed outflows from certain funds highlight the need for continuous evaluation of ETF offerings, as investors prioritize performance, fees, and strategic value. Conclusion The $223.1 million net inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on December 11 mark another milestone in the integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance. With Fidelity’s FBTC leading the charge, the sustained demand underscores the growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a valuable asset class.

37541287,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374417,1734002916,Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) Soars by 25% Daily: Is This the Potential Reason?,"TL;DR PNUT surged to almost $1.40 before stabilizing at $1.27, driven by Coinbase adding it to its “roadmap” and an overall resurgence in the meme coin sector. Inspired by a controversial incident involving a pet squirrel, PNUT gained massive attention after its launch in November, with early investors reaping significant profits during its explosive bull run. PNUT on the Run Again Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) – a Solana-based meme coin which saw the light of day in November this year – took center stage today (December 12) thanks to its rapid price increase. Its valuation jumped by around 25% on a daily scale, reaching almost $1.40. In the past several hours, PNUT lost some steam, falling to its current $1.27 (per CoinGecko’s data). PNUT Price, Source: CoinGecko The meme coin’s latest rally was likely triggered by the leading crypto exchange Coinbase, which placed the asset on its “roadmap.” It is worth noting that tokens added in that section are still in the experimental zone and must meet certain criteria before being officially listed. Some well-known cryptocurrency exchanges that have already embraced PNUT include Binance, Bybit, Bitget, HTX, Gate.io, and more. Another factor which could have positively affected the price of the squirrel-themed asset is the overall resurgence of the meme coin sector. In the past 24 hours, the market capitalization of the niche has soared by 8%, nearing $140 billion. Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), dogwifhat (WIF), Bonk Inu (BONK), Floki Inu (FLOKI), and many other memes have charted significant gains for the aforementioned period . Conversely, Mog Coin (MOG) and Simon’s Cat (CAT) are among the very few experiencing minor losses. PNUT’s Launch and Explosive Rally As mentioned above, the meme coin went live at the start of November. It is inspired by a pet squirrel named Peanut, which reportedly bit a Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) worker during a seizure operation and was later euthanized to test for rabies. Its death caused huge controversy, with many people labeling the move as unnecessary since the animal had lived indoors for years and showed no signs of the disease. Elon Musk was among the critics, describing the effort as a “government overreach ” and provocatively saying that “Donald Trump would save the squirrels.” The massive interest in PNUT (among other factors) fueled a bull run for the asset’s price, with some savvy investors making millions due to entering the ecosystem in the early days and cashing out at the right time. Those willing to see how one trader turned a $17 investment in the meme coin into more than $3 million, feel free to take a look at our dedicated video below: The post Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) Soars by 25% Daily: Is This the Potential Reason? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",POSITIVE,SHIB | MOG,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | SHIB | TRADING | MOG,,0,0,Crypto Potato,https://cryptopotato.com/peanut-the-squirrel-pnut-soars-by-25-daily-is-this-the-potential-reason/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/37541287.jpeg

According to data from Farside Investors, this marks the 13th consecutive day of positive inflows, underscoring growing investor confidence in Ethereum-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs). BlackRock’s ETHA led the way with $74.2 million in net inflows, solidifying its position as a dominant player in the Ethereum ETF market. Other notable contributors included Grayscale Mini ETH Trust ($13.4 million), Bitwise’s ETHW ($8.2 million), and Franklin’s EZET ($2.9 million). However, Grayscale’s ETHE reported a net outflow of $2.3 million, signaling mixed investor sentiment toward its fund. Ethereum ETFs: Growing Investor Interest Spot Ethereum ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the cryptocurrency. These funds are backed by actual Ethereum holdings, providing transparency and a regulated avenue for participation. The $102 million inflow highlights the growing appeal of Ethereum ETFs, driven by: Institutional Demand : Increased participation from institutions seeking exposure to Ethereum as a long-term asset. Mainstream Adoption : Growing awareness of Ethereum’s utility in powering decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Regulatory Clarity : Recent advancements in crypto regulations have boosted confidence in ETF investments. Performance Highlights of Leading ETFs BlackRock’s ETHA BlackRock’s ETHA dominated the inflows with $74.2 million, reflecting its strong market reputation and the trust placed in its Ethereum ETF by institutional and retail investors. Grayscale Mini ETH Trust With $13.4 million in inflows, Grayscale Mini ETH Trust continues to attract investors, leveraging its established brand and focus on Ethereum’s growth potential. Bitwise’s ETHW Bitwise’s ETHW saw $8.2 million in inflows, highlighting its appeal to investors seeking diversified exposure to Ethereum. Franklin’s EZET Franklin’s EZET recorded $2.9 million in inflows, signaling steady growth in its ETF offerings. Grayscale’s ETHE While most funds reported positive inflows, Grayscale’s ETHE experienced a net outflow of $2.3 million.

This trend reflects sustained interest in Ethereum as a critical player in the cryptocurrency market, driven by its versatility and real-world applications. Ethereum’s Role in the Broader Crypto Market Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, powering decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and various blockchain-based solutions. As the Ethereum network continues to evolve with upgrades like the transition to proof-of-stake (PoS), its investment appeal has grown significantly. Investors are drawn to Ethereum for: Smart Contract Capability : Enabling decentralized applications across industries. DeFi Dominance : Serving as the backbone for most DeFi protocols. Scarcity Mechanisms : The EIP-1559 upgrade introduced ETH burning, reducing supply and enhancing its value proposition. What’s Driving Ethereum ETF Growth? Several factors contribute to the rising popularity of Ethereum ETFs: Regulated Access : Spot Ethereum ETFs provide a safer, regulated way to invest in Ethereum, appealing to institutions wary of direct crypto exposure. Portfolio Diversification : ETFs offer a convenient way for investors to diversify their portfolios with exposure to Ethereum’s growth. Market Maturity : As the cryptocurrency market matures, more investors are turning to Ethereum for its strong use case and market potential. Challenges Facing Ethereum ETFs Despite their success, Ethereum ETFs face challenges that could impact their growth trajectory: Regulatory Uncertainty : While progress has been made, evolving regulations could affect ETF operations. Market Volatility : Ethereum’s price remains subject to significant fluctuations, influencing investor sentiment. Competition : With multiple ETFs in the market, funds must differentiate themselves to attract inflows. Conclusion The $102 million net inflow into U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on December 11 underscores Ethereum’s growing appeal as a vital investment asset. With BlackRock’s ETHA leading the charge, the 13-day streak of inflows highlights sustained confidence in Ethereum’s potential to drive the next phase of blockchain innovation. As Ethereum ETFs continue to gain traction, their role in bridging traditional finance and the cryptocurrency market is becoming increasingly significant. For investors, the growth of these funds represents an accessible and regulated way to participate in Ethereum’s success story.

37541264,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109369,1734002853,Former Binance CEO CZ: Crypto Projects Should Focus on Live Demos Over Pitches,"Former Binance CEO CZ: Crypto Projects Should Focus on Live Demos Over Pitches Changpeng Zhao, the former CEO of Binance and a key figure in the cryptocurrency industry, has offered a crucial piece of advice for crypto startups. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), CZ suggested that cryptocurrency projects should shift their focus from brief pitches at conferences to live demonstrations. “A live demo is worth 1,000 pitches,” he stated, underscoring the importance of showcasing real functionality over theoretical promises. This guidance comes as the crypto space becomes increasingly competitive, where standing out often requires more than just a compelling narrative. The Case for Live Demonstrations In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, startups often rely on conference pitches to attract investors, partners, and users. However, CZ argues that these pitches frequently fall short of conveying the true potential of a project. Key Benefits of Live Demos : Showcasing Functionality : Demonstrations allow audiences to see a product in action, building trust and credibility. Engaging Visuals : A live demo can captivate audiences far more effectively than slides or verbal pitches. Immediate Feedback : Demonstrations enable real-time feedback, allowing project teams to address questions and concerns directly. Proof of Concept : Showing a working product signals that the project is beyond the idea stage, making it more appealing to investors. The Pitfalls of Traditional Pitches Conference pitches, while common, have limitations: Lack of Context : Short presentations often fail to capture the depth and uniqueness of a project. Overreliance on Buzzwords : Many pitches rely on trendy terminology without showcasing tangible results. Limited Engagement : Passive listening during pitches often fails to engage audiences meaningfully. CZ’s Additional Advice: The Importance of Business Cards In his post, CZ also highlighted the practical value of business cards for follow-ups. He noted that handing out cards allows for seamless communication with his team, avoiding the need to share personal contact details. Why Business Cards Matter : Professionalism : Business cards create a lasting impression and convey credibility. Efficiency : They simplify the process of exchanging contact information during busy events. Delegation : Cards can be easily passed to team members for follow-ups, ensuring effective communication. Adapting to CZ’s Insights: Strategies for Crypto Projects Startups in the cryptocurrency industry can leverage CZ’s advice by incorporating live demos and professional follow-up practices into their promotional strategies: Invest in Demonstrations Develop a polished, user-friendly demo of your product. Practice delivering the demo in a concise and engaging manner. Highlight key features that solve real-world problems. Prepare for Follow-Ups Design professional business cards that include essential contact information. Create a system for tracking and following up with leads after events. Balance Pitches and Demos Use pitches to introduce your project and generate interest. Transition into a live demo to showcase the product’s functionality and value. Why CZ’s Advice Matters As one of the most influential figures in the cryptocurrency industry, CZ’s insights carry significant weight. During his tenure as Binance CEO, he led the exchange to become a global leader, making his strategies and recommendations invaluable for crypto entrepreneurs. By advocating for live demonstrations, CZ highlights the growing importance of transparency and functionality in a market often criticized for overpromising and underdelivering. The Broader Impact on the Crypto Industry If more crypto projects adopt CZ’s approach, the industry could see a shift toward greater accountability and innovation: Better Products : The focus on live demos encourages teams to prioritize development and deliver tangible results. Enhanced Trust : Demonstrations help rebuild trust in an industry that has faced skepticism due to scams and unfulfilled promises. Investor Confidence : Investors are more likely to back projects that showcase proven functionality. Conclusion Former Binance CEO CZ’s call for live demos over pitches is a timely reminder for crypto projects to prioritize substance over style. By demonstrating their products in action, startups can build trust, engage their audience, and stand out in a crowded market. For entrepreneurs in the space, integrating live demos and effective follow-up practices can be the key to attracting investors, partners, and users in an increasingly discerning market.

The breach happened on September 30 but wasn’t discovered until November 18. Hackers got in by exploiting a vulnerability in GitLab, a popular tool used by developers, and gained access to Byte Federal’s systems. Hackers exploited GitLab vulnerability The stolen data includes a shocking amount of personal information: names, birthdates, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, government-issued IDs, Social Security numbers, transaction records, and even user photos. Byte Federal revealed the breach in a filing with Maine’s attorney general and said it acted quickly to limit the damage. According to the company, the hack happened because of a bug in third-party software, specifically GitLab. The bug let an attacker slip into the network and possibly steal customer data. With over 1,200 Bitcoin ATMs across the U.S., Byte Federal is a major target for hackers because of the sensitive info its machines store. The company said it has reset all customer accounts, changed passwords, and stepped up security protocols. Byte Federal assured users, saying, “We have no evidence that your personal information was compromised or misused in any manner. Nonetheless, we are taking precautionary steps to safeguard your data.” Despite this, the extent of the breach has people questioning whether Byte Federal’s security is strong enough to protect sensitive customer data. Byte Federal is telling users to change their passwords right away. It also suggested adding fraud alerts or freezing accounts with major credit bureaus to prevent identity theft.

37541133,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392266,1734002606,"3 Tokens from the 2021 Bull Run Set to Rocket Again, and 1 New Coin That Will Rise Even Higher","The post 3 Tokens from the 2021 Bull Run Set to Rocket Again, and 1 New Coin That Will Rise Even Higher appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Many tokens witnessed tremendous growth during the bull run of 2021 and earned good recognition in the crypto space! Solana, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu stood out during that period and returned high profits for their early investors. However, a new contender, Rexas Finance (RXS), is coming strong to overtake them as it would revolutionize the tokenization of real-world assets through low-powered general-purpose blockchains. Strain your eyes and read on to understand what’s in store. Solana (SOL): The Scalability Powerhouse In 2021, Solana had a staggering time, reaching $258. Thanks to high scaling and optimal transaction costs, it was at the top of the market. It was also traded at $259.37, with a total market share of $113.2 billion. For one, Solana has become the center of new developments revolving around blockchain connections, putting it in the middle once again. Data from the last month shows that Solana is gaining traction as the dominant chain over DEX trading volume, leaving the Ethereum blockchain behind. This trend is quite encouraging for Solana as the analysis of projections gets bullish and reveals that it can reach up to $500 during the next bull run, which is a good prospect for huge returns. Dogecoin (DOGE): Meme Coin With Strong Community Presently, Dogecoin’s trading price is $0.4468, and its market cap is $65.7 billion. Retail investors still revere it. There is still concern regarding DOGE’s speculative nature, but it is gaining traction as a means of payment and has strong community backing. If anything, the evolution of the meme coin keeps going. Dogecoin can potentially add another zero behind its price and double in value. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Dogecoin’s Rival Currently, SHIB trades at $0.0000317 and has a total market cap of $18.68 billion, including its multi-chain-focused SHIB master, whose core aim is to maximize utilities. The Shiba Inu token (SHIB) created a bullish pattern known as the Golden Cross and further increased its trading volumes. This implies that the coin is preparing for a major breakout. Experts estimate that Shiba Inu might increase by up to 1000 percent if it breaks the specified resistance levels, thereby making hundreds of new millionaires in this process. Rexas Finance (RXS): The New Contender Solana, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu are standouts. However, Rexas Finance is stepping up and is an intriguing new player in the crypto scene. The tokenization of real-world assets translates RXS to bridging the gap between conventional finance and blockchain. Such a turn allows the average investor to purchase a fraction of real estate investments, fine art, and commodities—all considered high-value assets—without breaking the bank. Key Features of Rexas Finance (RXS) The Rexas Finance ecosystem has been developed to provide users with high utility and adaptability. It encompasses features such as Rexas Estate, which focuses on real estate investments, Rexas Launchpad, which focuses on decentralized project funding, and Rexas GenAI, which targets developing NFTs using AI. All these and optimized yields from the Rexas Control Tower ensure that a user’s all-rounded profit is maximized. The RXS tokenomics are well-designed to prevent the project from collapsing anytime soon. Of the total minted tokens (1 billion tokens), 42.5 percent and above are set aside for the presale, 22.5 percent for staking pools, and 15 percent for liquidity. Other allocations include 10 percent for the treasury, 3 percent for marketing, and 2 percent for giveaways and partnerships. The presale was very effective and exceeded estimates, raising over $23 million and selling out 335 million tokens in 9 stages. It is in the final stage, where the price is at $0.125. This is an attractive price for early investors, as they can get RXS at $0.20 and index on major exchanges in 2025. CertiK Audit and Listing Potential Rexas Finance has focused on delivering both security and transparency to its clientele, and indeed, it has delivered. The firm is secured and has been vetted thoroughly by CertiK, a professional security firm dealing with blockchain securities, giving that added assurance of safety and reliability. RXS is already live on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko alongside its vision of major listings, which will boost the demand and, eventually the prices. Community Involvement by Providing Giveaway Rexas Finance is offering a million-dollar giveaway for its early advocates. In each draw, 20 random winners will receive 50,000 RXS tokens. This showcases the effort the project is putting into building a strong community. This campaign doesn’t just increase brand awareness but also encourages participation, hence making RXS more appealing to new investors. The Future Looks Bright for Crypto History has seen multiple bullish runs, but the incoming bull run looks promising. Dating back to when crypto was first introduced, history suggests brands like Solana, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu will benefit greatly. However, Rexas Finance has a different impression that differentiates it. With the integration of next-gen features, improved tokenomics, and relatable use cases, RXS has the potential for catastrophic returns. If portfolio diversification is something that you are looking for, these four tokens are your best bet. Famed tokens are on the rise, and pioneering tokens are also on the list. There’s so much potential growth waiting, from those who wish to take advantage of the solutions Rexas Finance has to offer, to even those who want to go for Solana, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu. You can make great moves in 2024.

With a renewed focus on fostering technological development and redefining regulatory frameworks, the United States may be positioning itself as a global leader in the digital economy. The potential appointments of Howard Lutnick and Scott Bessent to key economic roles bring expertise in financial markets and innovation, offering a chance to bridge traditional finance and emerging digital technologies. Louis Bellet, Co-Founder and CEO of Yellow Network, shares his perspective exclusively with Invezz on how these leadership changes could influence blockchain innovation and regulatory clarity in the US. Bellet explores the implications of new regulatory approaches, the opportunities and challenges for institutional investors, and the critical reforms needed to unlock the transformative potential of digital assets. Drawing from his experience at Yellow Network, a pioneer in bridging traditional finance with blockchain technology, he sheds light on the evolving dynamics of the global financial system. Invezz: With Howard Lutnick potentially joining as Commerce Secretary and Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary, how might their backgrounds in finance and technology influence the broader economic strategies for digital assets and blockchain innovation in the US?

Their combined influence could help shape regulatory frameworks that encourage innovation while maintaining appropriate oversight. The pair of appointments have the potential to accelerate the development of institutional-grade infrastructure for digital assets. At Yellow Network, we’re already working to bridge traditional finance and crypto through our state channel technology and clearing protocol, so having cabinet officials who understand both the transformative potential and practical challenges of blockchain technology could help create an environment where projects like ours can flourish while ensuring consumer protection. The key will be striking the right balance between innovation and stability – something both nominees have demonstrated they understand through their careers in traditional finance. Invezz: The departure of Gary Gensler at the SEC suggests a significant shift in regulatory approach. How do you anticipate this change could impact the delicate balance between crypto market innovation and necessary investor protections? The transition at the SEC marks an important inflection point for crypto regulation. While Gary Gensler’s tenure was characterised by assertive enforcement actions and a broad interpretation of securities laws as they apply to digital assets, any significant regulatory shift needs to be viewed through the lens of sustainable industry development. The core challenge has always been balancing innovation with investor protection, and I expect the new leadership will need to address this fundamental tension, albeit potentially with a different approach. From my perspective leading a protocol focused on institutional trading infrastructure, the most constructive path forward would be maintaining strong investor protections while providing clearer regulatory guidance – particularly around which digital assets qualify as securities and what compliance frameworks should look like for decentralised trading systems. The industry has matured significantly in recent years and many projects including ours are ready to work within well-defined regulatory parameters. While we may see a more accommodating regulatory stance, I believe the focus should remain on developing frameworks that enable compliant innovation rather than stepping back oversight entirely. The key will be finding the right balance that protects market participants while allowing transformative blockchain technologies to develop. Invezz: Given the proposed leadership changes and a more pro-crypto political stance of Donald Trump, what are the most critical policy reforms you believe are necessary to position the US as a global leader in digital asset regulation and technological development? The fundamental policy reform needed is a shift from reactive enforcement to proactive framework development. We need clear, comprehensive guidelines that define the classification of digital assets, establish standards for cross-chain infrastructure and create predictable paths to compliance. While maintaining strong investor protections, these frameworks should recognise the unique characteristics of blockchain technology and avoid simply forcing new innovations into outdated regulatory categories. Equally important is establishing coordinated oversight between regulatory bodies. The current fragmentation between the SEC, CFTC, Treasury and state regulators creates unnecessary complexity that impedes innovation. By harmonising regulatory approaches and creating specialised digital asset divisions within key agencies, we can build a regulatory environment that both protects market participants and allows the US to lead in technological advancement. In short, we need to create appropriate frameworks that match the technology’s potential. Invezz: The incoming Trump administration appears to be signaling a more market-friendly approach to cryptocurrencies. From an international economic perspective, how might this shift alter the global competitive landscape for digital financial technologies? The potential shift in US cryptocurrency policy could significantly rebalance the global digital finance landscape. While regions like Singapore, the United Arab Emirates and the European Union have developed clear regulatory frameworks that have attracted digital asset businesses, a more accommodating US approach could rapidly shift the centre of gravity for innovation and capital formation back to American markets. This is particularly significant given the US dollar’s role in the global financial system and America’s deep capital markets. However, this shift could also accelerate the development of competing financial centres as other jurisdictions respond to maintain their competitive positions. We’re likely to see increased competition in areas like cross-border payment systems, digital asset trading infrastructure and centralised finance integration. What’s crucial is that this doesn’t become a race to the bottom in terms of oversight – rather, it should drive the development of sophisticated frameworks that balance innovation with appropriate safeguards. Invezz: What are the most significant challenges and opportunities you see for institutional investors and traditional financial systems in adapting to an evolving regulatory environment? The primary challenge for institutional investors lies in developing robust frameworks for digital asset integration while maintaining compliance with evolving regulations. Traditional financial institutions must navigate the technical complexities of blockchain infrastructure, establish appropriate custody solutions and implement risk management systems specifically designed for digital assets – all while operating within regulatory uncertainty. This requires significant investment in technology and expertise, along with the flexibility to adapt as regulatory frameworks crystallise. The opportunities, however, are substantial. We’re seeing increased demand for sophisticated trading and settlement solutions that bridge traditional and digital finance. Institutions that successfully develop these capabilities will be well-positioned to capture new revenue streams, particularly in areas like cross-chain liquidity provision and institutional-grade custody services. The key advantage for established institutions is their existing risk management expertise and compliance infrastructure, which can be adapted to meet the unique challenges of digital assets.

The purchase was made primarily through Coinbase and its institution-focused crypto services platform, Prime. BlackRock And Fidelity’s Collective ETH Purchase BlackRock and Fidelity are two of the largest ETF issuers, with their ETHA and FETH leading the all-time high inflows registered on November 30. According to the available market data, BlackRock’s ETHA brought in $372 million, while Fidelity’s FETH brought in $103 million on December 10. Details about the ETH purchase were revealed by crypto data tracking platform, Arkham, which revealed the financial giants bought $500 million worth of ETH in 48 hours. According to Arkham, both firms completed the purchase through Coinbase or its institution-focused crypto services platform, Prime. “PAST 48 HOURS: BLACKROCK AND FIDELITY BOUGHT OVER HALF A BILLION USD OF ETH.” The move shows that both ETF issuers are taking significant action in their portfolio by acquiring more ETH after receiving approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) is the largest issuer with inflows of up to $2.93 billion. Fidelity’s Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) is the second-largest issuer, with inflows of up to $1.35 billion. BlackRock And Fidelity’s Plans With Ethereum BlackRock is planning to start Ether ETF spot trading options. As of now, ETHA is the only ETF listed on Nasdaq. However, the decision will only be announced by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in April 2025. Some experts have stated that BlackRock will also need approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC). Fidelity recently filed a proposal for a spot Ethereum ETF with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The proposal also included staking and will track the performance of Ethereum. According to the company, the Fidelity Ethereum Fund will issue shares on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). “The Fidelity Ethereum Fund (the ‘Trust’) is an exchange-traded product that issues shares of beneficial interest and seeks to list and trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. The Trust’s investment objective is to track the performance of ether, as measured by the performance of the Fidelity Ethereum Reference Rate, adjusted for the Trust’s expenses and other liabilities,” the company detailed in the filing.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

According to Garlinghouse, Ripple has been invited by industry leaders to explore the use of XRP in various sectors, including real estate, insurance, and trade finance. During the video, Garlinghouse remarked on the evolving landscape of blockchain technology, comparing it to the early days of the Internet. BRAD GARLINGHOUSE, CEO OF RIPPLE SAYS THEY BEEN INVITED TO USE XRP IN REAL ESTATE, INSURANCE, AND TRADE FINANCE THIS IS THE REASON XRP CO-FOUNDER BRITTO SAID XRP WAS DESIGNED FOR $10,000 AND TO SUPPORT BILLIONS OF PEOPLE!

And you’ve seen an experimentation around identity in real estate and title management. And these are all examples where I think it’s so hard to predict where this will go.” XRP’s Expanding Utility Across Industries The comments from Ripple’s CEO reflect the broader vision for XRP as a tool for improving efficiency in global financial processes. Garlinghouse mentioned how trade finance—a critical component of global commerce—is beginning to experiment with blockchain technology. By leveraging XRP, Ripple aims to streamline processes, reduce costs, and address inefficiencies in traditional financial systems. The exploration of XRP in real estate and title management is another interesting area. Blockchain technology is increasingly viewed as a solution for improving transparency and security in real estate transactions. XRP could help to expedite settlement processes and reduce the reliance on intermediaries. Ripple’s solutions could enhance efficiency in the insurance sector by enabling instant cross-border payments for claims and premiums. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The $10,000 XRP Debate FinanceBro’s tweet referenced a controversial statement by XRP co-founder Arthur Britto, who previously suggested that XRP was designed to support a $10,000 valuation and serve billions of people globally. While some XRP enthusiasts see this as a long-term goal, others remain skeptical of such predictions. A Twitter user, Etey, responded to caution investors, advising them to take profits during price increases rather than waiting for unrealistic price targets. “If ur newbie i will tell now this figure will never hit. Stay focus if u bought below 2$ start pulling profit evry pump,” Etey wrote. The Path Forward for XRP Garlinghouse’s remarks underscore the growing interest in Ripple’s technology and the broader utility of XRP . However, predicting the cryptocurrency’s future price remains speculative. Despite its potential, the cryptocurrency market is influenced by numerous factors, including regulatory developments, adoption rates, and macroeconomic conditions. For now, Ripple continues to work on expanding its reach across various industries, aiming to position XRP as a critical component of next-generation financial infrastructure.

37540559,https://crypto.news/?p=14318698,1734001657,Sygnum Bank: New institutional investors likely to enter crypto,"As the anticipation of a pro-crypto regulatory environment is expected with President-elect Donald Trump’s arrival, Sygnum Bank, a Switzerland-based digital asset banking group, believes that the bull run is likely to continue into 2025. According to the latest Sygnum Bank report, most of the largest institutions haven’t entered the crypto ecosystem yet. “The opportunity for further steep price appreciation is from engagement by these investors,” the report reads . The U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded funds, launched in January, have already seen a net i n flow of $34.55 billion despite a $20.8 billion outflow from Grayscale’s GBTC fund. BlackRock alone recorded an inflow of over $35 billion into its IBIT ETF. These products allow exposure to crypto investments in the largest economy in the world. This is largely due to the expectations of pro-crypto policies, acting as a major catalyst for the bull run , with Trump’s arrival — the inauguration is scheduled for Jan. 20, 2025. You might also like: Three reasons SUI could target $7.66 by 2025 “Expectations of a much more favorable regulatory climate in the US have been fuelling the rally since Donald Trump’s election victory,” Sygnum wrote. Sygnum also expects stablecoin to gain mainstream adoption in 2025. Thanks to the recent market-wide bullish sentiment, the total stablecoin market cap surpassed the $200 billion mark, with USDT leading with roughly $140 billion, according to data from CoinGecko. The digital asset banking group’s report pointed out the limited use cases of stablecoins since most of their volume comes from trading cryptocurrencies on exchanges. “This might change soon, however,” Sygnum added, hinting at the incoming regulations and stablecoin integrations into payment service providers like Visa , PayPal and MasterCard , to name a few. On the other hand, the Switzerland-based bank believes that altcoins , unlike the previous bull runs, wouldn’t shine as much as Bitcoin. One of the main reasons, Sygnum says, is the spot BTC ETFs. Sygnum’s report reads: “The Bitcoin ETFs provided market access to investors who are not set up to trade and settle direct investments in crypto assets. These holders will not be selling their Bitcoin ETFs to buy altcoins.” Read more: India’s chief economic advisor calls for regulation that doesn’t hinder crypto innovation",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TRADING,,0,0,crypto.news,https://crypto.news/sygnum-bank-new-institutional-investors-likely-to-enter-crypto/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/37540559.jpeg

He doubts Musk and Ramaswamy will succeed in reducing the budget using their proposed policies. Speaking to news correspondent Elizabeth Vargas, former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci called Musk and Ramaswamy “very smart, capable entrepreneurs.” However, he said that even though he doesn’t want to bet against them, they could fail in their budget-cut policies due to legislation protecting allocated budgets in Washington. . @Scaramucci doubts Musk-Ramaswamy’s DOGE success: ""I know how Washington works and I know how slow it is in the process of cutting things."" pic.twitter.com/wEMAvU9Brn — Yahoo Finance (@YahooFinance) December 12, 2024 In his interview, Scaramucci acknowledged the importance of cutting government waste but emphasized the complexities involved. He pointed out that while the U.S. population has grown significantly since the 1980s, the number of federal employees has remained largely unchanged since the Reagan era. He highlighted previous attempts to address government inefficiencies, such as the Reagan-era Grace Commission and the Simpson-Bowles plan during the Obama administration. Despite their ambitious recommendations, these reports were largely dismissed by lawmakers, illustrating the difficulties of implementing fiscal reform . Scaramucci: Government is not like a for-profit business Scaramucci warned against treating the government like a for-profit business, arguing that its primary purpose is to serve the public. “ The government is there to protect people, smooth out economic cycles, and provide a safety net, ” he said. Moreover, he noted that no company has remained in the Dow Jones Industrial Average for a century, while the U.S. government has persisted for over 250 years due to its unique role and nonprofit orientation. The former White House communications director also criticized proposals to slash essential programs, such as veterans’ medical care, calling such cuts “politically unpalatable and cruel.” Scaramucci stressed the importance of safeguarding programs that provide fairness and equal opportunities for Americans. Drawing on historical examples, the American financier advocated for a return to “pay-as-you-go” legislation, initially introduced under President George H.W. Bush. This approach required Congress to balance new spending with corresponding budget cuts or tax increases. He credited this policy with helping achieve a budget surplus during the Clinton administration. By reinstating similar fiscal guardrails, Scaramucci suggested it could take a decade to bring the deficit to sustainable levels without dismantling critical government structures. Scaramucci proposed gradual measures to curb spending. He suggested limiting the organic growth of departmental budgets , typically 3-5% annually, to achieve “zero growth” in certain areas. Over time, he argued, as GDP and tax revenues increase, this strategy would help reduce deficits. The feasibility of Musk’s plan While Musk’s call for $2 trillion in cuts resonates with fiscal conservatives, Scaramucci highlighted its practical challenges. Major budget areas like Social Security, Medicare, and military spending remain politically untouchable, with both Musk and former President Donald Trump avoiding cuts in these areas. Public opinion also favors maintaining or increasing military funding, further complicating the equation. Billionaire entrepreneur Musk and Republican Vivek Ramaswamy are set to helm the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) under the upcoming Trump administration. The initiative aims to tackle the persistent issue of federal overspending by auditing the executive branch and offering solutions to curb wasteful expenditures. Observers have noted parallels between their proposed efforts and Argentina’s recent fiscal reforms, which have brought the nation’s budget deficit to effectively zero for the first time in over a century. Argentina's Milei eliminates deficit, hailed as model for Musk's 'DOGE' https://t.co/M279vP1AIZ — FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) December 12, 2024 Argentina, under President Javier Milei, achieved a historic budgetary turnaround in 2024. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported that the country’s deficit, once a defining feature of its economy, has been eliminated. Adapting Argentina’s approach to the U.S. Musk and Ramaswamy are reportedly drawing inspiration from Argentina’s policies as they develop their strategy for the United States. The D.O.G.E. program, while not an official government agency, will function as an advisory body providing detailed recommendations to President-elect Donald Trump. These recommendations are expected to focus on reducing waste and improving efficiency in federal operations. The program’s scope includes a comprehensive audit of the U.S. executive branch, identifying redundant programs and bureaucratic inefficiencies. Despite its ambitious goals, D.O.G.E. does not possess direct enforcement powers. The Trump administration will ultimately decide which of the organization’s proposals to implement.

On Dec. 11, Juan Carlos Reyes, president of El Salvador’s National Commission of Digital Assets (NCDA), announced the partnership with Roberto Silva, head of Argentina’s National Securities Commission (CNV). Mutual Collaboration in Crypto Regulation The collaboration aims to leverage El Salvador’s three years of regulatory expertise and Argentina’s innovative blockchain ecosystem to create a highly productive alliance. “We believe the combination of El Salvador’s early regulatory experience and Argentina’s technological innovation will yield great results for both nations,” Reyes said . The agreement facilitates the sharing of regulatory frameworks, technical expertise, and information on market trends. Reyes stated that several Argentine companies are already operating legally in El Salvador. Global Outreach Beyond this agreement, El Salvador is in discussions with over 25 other countries to establish similar collaborations. Recognizing its unconventional regulatory approach, Reyes emphasized that these partnerships are designed to foster cross-border learning and effective regulation in the crypto industry. To support these efforts, El Salvador has assembled a dedicated team of over 20 Bitcoin experts and crypto professionals to guide and assist international collaborations. Reyes advised regulators worldwide to act promptly in setting up robust frameworks, warning that delays could allow scams and illicit activities to proliferate. “Waiting too long to regulate creates vulnerabilities, making it easier for bad actors to exploit the system,” he said, urging nations to adopt Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations and embrace global cooperation. More Agreements Ahead El Salvador is reportedly nearing the finalization of two additional agreements with unnamed countries, demonstrating its commitment to becoming a global leader in digital asset regulation. Reyes emphasized the importance of knowledge sharing, stating, “Our experience has shown that cross-border collaboration is vital for creating a secure and effective regulatory environment.” Since adopting Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, El Salvador has been at the forefront of crypto innovation .

As the crypto market cap reclaims $3.65 trillion, the meme coin sector is back on its feet. The market cap of meme tokens has surged to $125 billion, driven by the massive gains of Dogecoin , FLOKI, and PEPE.Over the past 24 hours, Dogecoin has increased by 5.33%, followed by FLOKI's 9.07% rise, with both tokens ranking among the top performers. Amid the bullish recovery, Dogecoin's market cap has reached $61.17 billion, with a 24-hour price increase of $0.4157.Dogecoin Price AnalysisIn the 4-hour chart, Dogecoin's price action shows a sideways trend within two crucial boundary levels. The support level is at $0.3488, with overhead resistance at $0.4681. This range has remained consistent for the past few sessions, reflecting a consolidation phase in the market. Dogecoin Price Chart Multiple doji candles on the 4-hour chart indicate indecisiveness, signaling a potential bearish turnaround. However, the ongoing bullish momentum is attempting to shift this sentiment.Currently, Dogecoin’s price action shows a bullish reversal from $0.3656, which has reignited optimism among traders. The recovery rally, contributing to a 14% surge, has helped Dogecoin reclaim the psychological mark of $0.40.This milestone has restored confidence in the market. The S1 pivot level aligns with this level, reinforcing its significance as key support.Amid the recovery rally, the MACD and signal lines have given a positive crossover, accompanied by new bullish histograms. This momentum suggests a potential shift in market dynamics.Thus, the technical indicators support Dogecoin’s bullish outlook, with a possible challenge to the overhead trendline, which could serve as the next major resistance.Dogecoin Price TargetsDespite short-term indecisiveness, the underlying surge in demand as the broader market recovers suggests a bullish comeback for Dogecoin. Based on the pivot levels, the uptrend will likely challenge the center pivot level at $0.4465.In the event of an extended rally, the meme coin could reclaim the $0.50 psychological mark, creating a new 52-week high.

Crypto King Musk (MUSKKING), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKKING is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Crypto King Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crypto King Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Crypto King Musk launched with over $7,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crypto King Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Crypto King Musk by entering its contract address – v2jWiNpR1m8gHARdM39GosZ8muaxZpowpBgWgWTSCev – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKKING.

Hours later, the meme coin was also listed on Coinbase Advanced, the exchange’s platform designed for more experienced traders. The renewed interest from traders subsequently propelled the meme coin to trend on Google.

Earlier this month, Meta said it was planning to build a $10 billion AI data center in Richland Parish, La., Reuters reported.  There are similarities between bitcoin miners and AI data centers in the required equipment, computing power and energy to run it all. Some bitcoin miners have been dedicating resources to AI computation to diversify their revenue streams.  Hut 8 previously announced a $500 million at-the-market (ATM) offering and a $250 million stock-repurchase program. The company has said it mined 94 BTC in November, a 6% month-on-month decrease.

If you invested $1,000 in SHIB at the start of 2021, you’d be sitting on an impressive windfall today. Let’s dive into the numbers, token supply dynamics, and the factors that could influence SHIB’s potential to reclaim its all-time high (ATH) price of $0.000069. The investment: $1,000 in SHIB on January 1, 2021 On January 1, 2021, Shiba Inu was trading at a microscopic $0.0000001684. With a $1,000 investment, you could have purchased approximately 5,936,073,059 SHIB tokens. Fast forward to December 12, 2024, and SHIB’s current price stands at $0.00002909. At this price, your original investment would now be worth approximately $172,888, representing a 17,189% return on your initial $1,000 investment. SHIB all-time price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Shiba Inu supply dynamics At the start of 2021, SHIB had a total supply of 1 quadrillion tokens (1,000,000,000,000,000) and a circulating supply of about 394.8 trillion tokens, since then, the supply dynamics have changed significantly due to major token burns: As of December 2024, SHIB has a total supply of 589.5 trillion tokens and a circulating supply of 589.25 trillion tokens. Despite these burns, SHIB’s circulating supply remains high, which plays a crucial role in its price potential. For SHIB to revisit its all-time high of $0.000069, it would require a market cap of approximately $40.6 billion. While not impossible, this is a substantial leap, given the token’s current market cap of $16.9 billion (based on the current price of $0.00002871). Year-to-date, Shiba Inu has surged by an impressive 181.61%, adding $0.00001876 to its value. SHIB YTD price chart.

If Quintenz earns the seat, however, some believe he could reshape the commission and give the crypto market a new outlook.

The Beam Foundation has unveiled plans for a $150 million venture fund in Abu Dhabi to bolster blockchain gaming projects, while crypto custody firm Casa has introduced a self-custody solution, Praetorian, designed to support nation-states considering Bitcoin as a strategic reserve. Casa Unveils Praetorian Self-Custody Service as Talk of Bitcoin Strategic Reserves Heats Up The adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) as a sovereign reserve asset has become a heated topic of discussion as countries and cities worldwide consider the implications of holding the decentralized digital asset in their treasuries. Crypto custody company Casa has stepped into the spotlight with the launch of Praetorian, a self-custody service designed specifically for nation-states. Casa’s Praetorian service aims to address the unique challenges faced by sovereign entities managing Bitcoin reserves. The service is built around Casa’s multisignature crypto vaults, which are strategically placed in separate jurisdictions to enhance security. Each vault employs robust encryption standards and allows for delegation between administrative personnel, providing a flexible yet secure framework for managing Bitcoin reserves. Nick Neuman, the co-founder and CEO of Casa, emphasized the importance of self-custody for nation-states, stating, ”Today, a nation can and should take self-custody of its private keys. This gives you full control over your sovereign reserves, and self-custody can be combined with thoughtfully designed tools to better maintain security and continuity through different administrations.” A standout feature of Praetorian is its independence from Casa’s operational continuity. Even if the company ceases to exist, sovereign reserves managed through the service will remain secure, ensuring uninterrupted access to funds. Growing Momentum for Bitcoin as a Strategic Reserve The introduction of Praetorian aligns with a broader movement among global leaders and policymakers to explore Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Bitcoin’s scarcity and decentralized nature make it an attractive option for hedging against inflation and diversifying national reserves. These characteristics have prompted notable figures to advocate for its adoption. During a recent appearance on Yahoo Finance, investor and asset manager Anthony Pompliano highlighted the unfolding ”global race for Bitcoin.” According to Pompliano, the finite supply of 21 million coins is sparking competitive dynamics among nation-states. He suggested that countries might rush to secure a share of the Bitcoin supply to gain a strategic advantage. Senator Cynthia Lummis has also championed Bitcoin as a reserve asset, proposing that the United States Treasury convert some of its gold holdings into Bitcoin. Lummis argued that such a move would result in a neutral balance sheet effect, while acquiring approximately 5% of Bitcoin’s total supply could bolster the nation’s financial resilience. The concept of Bitcoin reserves has gained traction beyond the United States. In December, Vancouver Mayor Ken Sim proposed allocating a portion of the city’s treasury to Bitcoin, citing its potential to hedge against inflation and preserve purchasing power. The global race for Bitcoin reserves is not limited to Western nations. At the Bitcoin Middle East and North Africa (MENA) 2024 conference, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao suggested that it was ” inevitable ” for China to establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve. Zhao explained that geopolitical competition could drive China to act, especially if the United States takes the lead under a Trump administration. This sentiment brings attention to the potential for Bitcoin to reshape international financial strategies. As more countries explore Bitcoin reserves, the cryptocurrency could become a focal point in the geopolitical landscape, influencing everything from trade policies to economic security measures. The Future of Bitcoin in Sovereign Reserves Casa’s launch of Praetorian represents a pivotal moment in the evolving relationship between nation-states and Bitcoin . By providing a secure, self-custody solution tailored for sovereign entities, Casa is addressing critical concerns about autonomy, security, and continuity in managing Bitcoin reserves. As discussions about Bitcoin’s role in national treasuries continue to intensify, Praetorian could become an essential tool for countries seeking to embrace the decentralized asset while maintaining control over their financial sovereignty. Whether prompted by economic pragmatism or geopolitical pressures, the adoption of Bitcoin reserves appears to be gaining momentum, marking a significant shift in the global financial paradigm. Beam Foundation to Launch $150M Venture Fund in Abu Dhabi for Blockchain Gaming Projects Casa is not the only company making moves in the crypto space. The Beam Foundation has recently announced its ambitious plans to launch a $150 million venture fund in Abu Dhabi aimed at bolstering blockchain gaming projects and related technologies. Scheduled to debut in the first half of 2025, the fund marks a significant milestone for both the Beam Foundation and Abu Dhabi's growing Web3 ecosystem. The new fund, backed by local investors, will focus primarily on blockchain-based games and gaming infrastructure. It also plans to extend its reach to startups working on cutting-edge solutions in artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR), and user-generated content. Complementing its financial support, the fund will launch an accelerator program to help startups scale. The program will emphasize brand building, go-to-market strategies, and sustainable growth, offering a comprehensive support system for budding companies. Beam’s Chief Strategy Officer, Mark Borsten, shared an update about the initiative on X, stating: “A few months ago, we went on a first exploration trip. Soon after, we shook hands with the best parties to make Beam Ventures happen. Today, we are finalizing the licensing process and can be more forward-facing with the fund and accelerator very soon.” The Beam Foundation is currently navigating the regulatory approval process to establish its operations in Abu Dhabi. Once finalized, the foundation aims to set new benchmarks for blockchain gaming innovation. The Beam Foundation is renowned for its blockchain technology, which empowers game developers to create sovereign networks where players retain ownership of in-game assets. The platform already hosts about 20 games, highlighting its role as a catalyst for innovation in the blockchain gaming industry. The foundation’s move to establish a venture fund comes at a time when blockchain gaming is witnessing a resurgence. After a challenging crypto winter, the sector has bounced back in tandem with the broader cryptocurrency market. Recent data from DappRadar reveals that blockchain gaming accounted for 28.2% of the market share in November 2024, with an average of 6.8 million daily active wallets. Venture capital investments in the sector reached $222 million during the same period. Abu Dhabi has emerged as a global hub for Web3 innovation, thanks to its progressive regulatory framework and strategic investments in the crypto sector. Over the past few years, the city has cultivated a thriving ecosystem that continues to attract leading blockchain and cryptocurrency firms. In 2024 alone, Abu Dhabi welcomed prominent players such as options trading platform QCP Capital, venture firms Hashed Ventures and Laser Digital, and market maker DWF Labs. These firms join an expanding roster of blockchain companies leveraging Abu Dhabi’s crypto-friendly environment. The UAE government has also taken proactive steps to regulate and encourage innovation in the crypto sector. In June 2024, the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates introduced a new licensing and monitoring system for stablecoins, ensuring a secure and compliant environment for local companies to operate. The Rising Tide of Blockchain Gaming The timing of Beam’s venture fund aligns with the blockchain gaming sector's resurgence. As cryptocurrency prices surged in 2024, the gaming industry experienced renewed interest from both players and investors. Blockchain gaming’s unique value proposition—offering true asset ownership, decentralized economies, and immersive experiences—has made it a key area of growth within the broader crypto ecosystem. By establishing its venture fund in Abu Dhabi, Beam Foundation is positioning itself at the intersection of two burgeoning trends: the rise of blockchain gaming and the UAE's ascent as a global crypto hub. This strategic alignment could set the stage for transformative developments in the gaming and blockchain industries. Overall, the Beam Foundation’s $150 million venture fund is not just an investment vehicle but a signal of the growing synergy between blockchain technology and gaming. By fostering innovation and supporting startups through funding and mentorship, Beam aims to catalyze a new wave of growth and creativity in the industry. Abu Dhabi, with its supportive regulatory environment and commitment to Web3 innovation, provides the ideal backdrop for such an initiative. As the fund gears up for its 2025 launch, it will likely attract global attention, further cementing Abu Dhabi’s status as a powerhouse in blockchain and crypto innovation.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6513/casa-unveils-praetorian-self-custody-service-for-sovereign-bitcoin-reserves,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

MV Global is a blockchain-focused venture studio renowned for building infrastructure companies aimed at advancing blockchain adoption, with investments spanning prominent entities such as Coinbase, Kraken, Ripple, Circle, and Bitfinex. Dunleavy’s forecast positions Bitcoin (BTC) at a target of $250,000 and Ethereum (ETH) at $12,000 by the end of 2025. Additionally, he anticipates Solana (SOL) reaching $700. These projections are underpinned by an analysis that draws parallels between historical economic shifts and current policy movements within the United States. Dunleavy draws a comparison to the 1970s in the United States, specifically referencing President Nixon’s termination of the Gold Standard in 1971 as a pivotal economic shift. “If we look at the 1970s in the US, then President Nixon’s ending of the Gold Standard in 1971 could be seen as a similar pivot point as the shift we see with the Trump administration’s embrace of crypto,” Dunleavy stated.

Dunleavy suggests that a comparable trajectory could unfold for Bitcoin and altcoins under the upcoming administration’s policies. Quarterly Bitcoin And Crypto Predictions For 2025 Q1 2025: MV Global anticipates a sharp uptrend fueled by increasing excitement surrounding the new administration. “Trump’s first 100 days lead to a realization that the crypto agenda is actually top of mind,” Dunleavy explained. He expects a rapid market start, facilitated by the Biden administration’s cooperation in the transition process. Significant legislative advancements are anticipated within the first 100 days, particularly concerning market structure and stablecoins. Related Reading: Bitwise Forecast: Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Poised For Record Highs In 2025 “We also place a higher chance on meaningful progress towards a BTC strategic reserve and the game theory of subsequent nation state adoption,” Dunleavy adds. However, a market correction is expected as the US tax season approaches, with March historically being a challenging month for Bitcoin. Q2 2025: The second quarter is projected to witness a gradual yet consistent upward movement as institutional investors increasingly enter the asset class. “ Slow but steady march upward as more institutions come on board,”Dunleavy writes. He highlights the potential approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs by major Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) and brokerage firms such as Merrill Lynch and Charles Schwab. “ETH leads as the lack of a SOL ETF is a short-term impediment to institutional flows,” he noted, indicating that Ethereum may benefit more immediately from institutional adoption compared to Solana. Q3 2025: Summer is expected to bring a period of consolidation, with prices experiencing sideways movement. “Summer lull. Prices chop down,” Dunleavy predicts. The introduction of a spot Solana ETF or other crypto ETFs could provide a catalyst to break this stagnation. September is identified by the CIO as a critical month for potential Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rulings, which could significantly influence market dynamics. Q4 2025: The final quarter is anticipated to see a robust surge towards the year’s end, culminating in a blow-off top scenario. “Strong flurry into year end. Blow off top that we think bleeds into Q1 2026. This cycle peaks well into 2026 as the passive ETF bid keeps a very strong floor,” Dunleavy concludes. At press time, BTC traded at $100,812.

With the recent heavy daily liquidations in the leveraged market, Bitcoin’s funding rate has significantly declined to below the recent normal. Bitcoin Whales Accumulates Relentlessly The supply of Bitcoin on centralized exchanges has continued to decline sharply in the past year fueled by heightened demand from institutional investors. In the past 30 days, the supply of Bitcoin on CEXes declined by about 120k to hover about 2.23 million at the time of this writing. As more institutions adopt Bitcoin, its market potential grows. Read our Bitcoin price prediction for expert insights on what’s next! According to market data from Cryptoquant , Bitcoin has been attracting about $80 billion from long-term investors per month in the past year. Remarkably, the recent capital inflows to Bitcoin have significantly overshadowed the funds inflow in the past 15 years. Moreover, whale investors have been relentlessly accumulating Bitcoin in anticipation of the United States approving a strategic BTC reserve. According to the latest market data, the US spot Bitcoin ETFs registered a net cash inflow of about $223 million on Wednesday, thus bringing the cumulative total net inflow to about $34.58 billion. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Are Defying Trading Volume Slumps , What Next?

37539436,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626383,1733999172,What president Trump needs to do to bring inflation under control,"Inflation is climbing, and housing costs are making it worse. President Donald Trump’s economic plans need to tackle this issue head-on. Housing costs now make up a third of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures inflation. The November CPI report showed mixed results for housing. On one hand, annual growth in housing prices slowed to its lowest since February 2022. On the other hand, housing inflation still rose 4.7% in November, contributing 40% of the month’s overall inflation increase. This creates a major hurdle for Trump. The Federal Reserve wants inflation at 2%, but housing costs are standing in the way. Lisa Sturtevant, Bright MLS’s chief economist, explained that rents are slowing but not fast enough. She said, “It just feels like it’s taking a long time.” Housing supply and demand imbalance fuels inflation The housing market has struggled since COVID-19 disrupted supply chains and construction. Housing supply in November was 17% below its level from five years ago, according to Realtor.com. Demand, however, hasn’t dropped, leaving prices stubbornly high. Rents are a big part of the problem. Zillow reported the average rent in October was $2,009, up 3.3% from last year. Over the past four years, rents nationally have jumped by 30%. Mortgage rates are also an issue. While the Federal Reserve cut its key rate by 0.75% since September, 30-year mortgage rates have climbed, making homes even less affordable. For Trump, this is a tough situation. His plans, including tax cuts and tariffs, might actually fuel inflation. Deregulation might help housing but carries risks Trump has pushed for deregulation as a cornerstone of his economic strategy. This could help by opening more federal land for housing construction and easing barriers for builders. But monetary policy, which controls interest rates, is largely outside his control. Trump has been vocal about wanting lower rates, but the Federal Reserve operates independently. Wall Street seems cautiously optimistic about the housing market. Bank of America’s Stephen Juneau said rents are moving toward levels consistent with 2% inflation . But some do warn that shelter costs remain the biggest contributor to inflation. He said, “The rate of increase has slowed, but that’s no comfort.” Trump also faces a Catch-22: The Federal Reserve won’t lower rates until housing costs drop, but housing costs can’t drop without lower rates. Sturtevant pointed out that: “We’re not going to drop rates until shelter costs come down. But shelter can’t come down until rates are lower.” Inflation pressures spill into other sectors Beyond housing, inflation pressures remain strong in services. The Atlanta Fed’s wage growth tracker showed pay increases at a three-year low, which might help, but inflation in services remains above 4%. Specialized inflation metrics, like the Cleveland Fed’s trimmed mean and median inflation measures, indicate that progress is slow. Both metrics are still above 3%. This persistent inflation complicates Trump’s plans for tax cuts and tariffs , which could push prices higher. One-year bond market inflation expectations have doubled since the election, reflecting the uncertainty about Trump’s policies. The inflation story doesn’t end with housing and services. It’s also hitting the stock market. Tech stocks, especially the Nasdaq 100 and the so-called Magnificent Seven, surged after the November CPI report, reaching record highs. But analysts are divided on whether this rally is sustainable.

37539173,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392213,1733998996,Crypto Exchange Kraken Fined $5.1M for Regulatory Breach: Here’s the Full Story,"The post Crypto Exchange Kraken Fined $5.1M for Regulatory Breach: Here’s the Full Story appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In yet another crypto crackdown, Kraken’s Australian branch, Bit Trade, has been hit with a significant $5.1 million penalty after violating Australian financial laws. The global scenario is changing and countries are putting hefty fines for violations of financial laws. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) took action after Bit Trade offered margin trading products to over 1,100 customers without ensuring the products were suitable for them. While many are hoping for a “Santa rally” in the market, this news isn’t what investors expected to hear. Legal proceedings launched by ASIC have seen the Australian operator of the Kraken crypto exchange ordered to pay $8 million for unlawfully issuing a credit facility to more than 1,100 Australian customers https://t.co/YH8A4QRMTH pic.twitter.com/nB16fnTMmg — ASIC Media (@asicmedia) December 12, 2024 How Did Things Go Wrong? The issue lies with Bit Trade’s margin extension product, which functions like a loan, allowing customers to trade with more funds than they have available. However, the company offered this product without checking if it was appropriate for the customers’ financial situations. This led to losses exceeding $5 million. ASIC found that Bit Trade did not conduct the necessary checks, which might have prevented the losses. $5.1 Million Fine, Lower Than Expected ! Initially, ASIC sought a fine of $12.8 million, but the court found that amount too high and reduced the penalty to $5.1 million. Bit Trade had requested a much lower fine of $2.5 million, but the judge decided that wasn’t enough. The impact on investors was severe, with one individual losing nearly $4 million. ASIC’s chairman, Joe Longo, pointed out that this case highlights the importance of crypto firms following regulatory rules to protect consumers. Court Ruling The Federal Court of Australia ruled that Bit Trade’s margin product was actually a credit facility. This meant the company had to follow certain financial rules, including issuing a “target market determination”—a document that explains which customers are suitable for the product. Bit Trade did not provide this document, which led to the fine. This is the first time a firm has been penalized for failing to issue such a document. The company must pay the fine within 60 days. Kraken’s Response Kraken expressed disappointment with the ruling, warning that it could have negative effects on Australia’s economy. However, the company also reaffirmed its commitment to working with regulators to meet legal requirements moving forward. This fine emphasizes how important it is for crypto companies to comply with regulations, especially as governments around the world increase efforts to protect consumers from risky financial products. What Next? In response to the increasing regulatory pressure, Kraken is shutting down its NFT marketplace and laying off 15% of its staff as part of a restructuring plan.

The rate cut timed with Christmas bonuses could be the second wind that BTC needs. 342 wallets with over 100 BTC were created when BTC dropped a few days ago. Polymarket is pricing in a 25 BPS rate cut in the US, predicting the Federal Reserve to announce the decision. This anticipated cut, projected during high inflation, could shift market sentiment significantly, with traders preparing for impacts across traditional and digital assets. Prominent analyst Crypto Rand suggested in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that such a rate cut could revive the crypto market, pushing Bitcoin well above its all-time high of $103,900. Rate Cuts and Bitcoin’s $100K Milestone On the other hand, rate cuts often boost Bitcoin’s appeal by lowering yields on traditional assets, prompting investors to seek riskier alternatives like cryptocurrencies.

37538996,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/autonomous-ai-is-the-future-of-efficiency-across-industries,1733998623,Autonomous AI is the Future of Efficiency Across Industries,"Businesses are increasingly realizing the potential of AI by using autonomous agents, which help them become more efficient. These agents take the benefits of AI assistants a step further, possessing the capability to continually improve their performance without humans needing to intervene. With autonomous AI, businesses can have a fleet of advanced agents tailored to each department or unit's needs. Autonomous agents extract insights from customer data, delivering the most current and accurate information to customers, employees, and third parties. Autonomous agents function through natural language processing, machine learning, and real-time data analysis. They build on three key pillars. Data collection, decision-making, and action Autonomous agents start by collecting data from different sources, such as transaction histories, client interactions, and external databases. Gathering data is crucial for understanding each task's context and making informed decisions. They leverage machine learning algorithms to analyze the data, detect patterns, and predict outcomes, using the information obtained to make decisions in alignment with targets. In the context of customer service, they can analyze past interactions to determine the most suitable response to a customer's query. Taking action is the last stage. The agent executes the actions necessary to achieve the desired outcome, depending on the industry. In blockchain, AI agents developed by Oraichain Labs can create wallets and automate trading in a no-code environment. This is based on the previous stage of decision-making, specifically determining the optimal time to execute a trade based on market trends or choosing the type of blockchain wallet to create based on user needs. In customer service, the action would be processing orders or responding to questions. How industries are leveraging autonomous agents AI assistants can also learn and make decisions based on new information, but unlike autonomous AI agents, they cannot complete several consecutive tasks. Here's how the latest generation of AI agents improves efficiency across industries. Autonomous agents in blockchain and Web3 Oraichain and agents(dot)land announced a collaboration to alleviate the process of creating, customizing, and deploying AI agents on Solana. The agents(dot)land platform released a comprehensive launchpad for this purpose. The AI agents, developed by Oraichain Labs, enhance efficiency in blockchain and Web3 by creating and managing tokens, trading on DEXs, and participating in borrowing, lending, and liquidity management within DeFi. In addition, they can receive tips, offer pay-gated services, and manage revenue streams and expenses such as hosting and GPU usage fees without human intervention, expanding on use cases for companies and individuals. Oraichain's blockchain infrastructure powers agents(dot)land, enhancing security and privacy by integrating confidential compute technology. This enables agents to interact with Web2 and Web3, ensuring a smooth transition between the ecosystems. Financial services Autonomous AI agents allow banks to manage transaction disputes through different channels like the bank's website, app, call, or SMS without human intervention. Retail and communication Agents can share campaign insights, resolve cases, and proactively manage customer outreach. Basic chatbots cannot do anything beyond resolving predefined issues, but autonomous AI agents learn from customers' buying behavior and preferences. People receive conversational responses to natural language searches and add items to their carts quickly for instant checkout. With respect to billing, an autonomous communications agent can provide faster support for inquiries. When a customer files a complaint about a charge, the agent analyzes previous monthly bills, identifies the issue, and validates (or invalidates) the dispute. Customers get support, and issues are resolved more quickly, giving human agents more time to deal with higher priorities. Healthcare The need to improve the patient experience has become critical in many countries, and autonomous AI agents can contribute by engaging with patients (as well as healthcare providers and insurance companies) to resolve inquiries. An agent can answer simple patient inquiries, help schedule appointments with a suitable doctor, generate medical history summaries, review coverage benefits, and approve care requests. Urban planning In areas such as smart cities, AI agents monitor conditions and collect data in tandem with IoT sensors, then swiftly act on that data. AI agents can help reduce accidents, optimize routes, and minimize congestion. They can optimize traffic flow by analyzing real-time data from sensors and cameras and adjusting traffic signals. AI agents coordinate public transport, optimize schedules, predict delays, and provide real-time updates to commuters. Their potential in energy management is no less impressive. They can help manage energy distribution more efficiently by balancing supply and demand, integrating renewable sources, and reducing outages. AI-powered systems optimize building heating, cooling, and lighting to conserve energy. The core of efficiency: AI agents are reactive, proactive, and socially skilled Autonomous AI agents sense changes in their environment and respond in real-time. Their lightning-speed adaptiveness is crucial for urgent tasks, ensuring that they can intervene effectively in unexpected situations and crises. Beyond merely reacting, they can take initiative, predict needs or issues, and act to address them in advance. Their capability of thinking ahead sets them apart from AI assistants. Finally, agents possess the skills to interact with humans and other machines. The mutual effort enables the resolution of highly complex tasks. Transformative power in numbers Businesses across the globe are increasingly adopting AI to enhance efficiency and foster innovation. The autonomous AI market was valued at $6.8 billion in 2024 . It is predicted to increase by an average of 30.3% annually from 2025 to 2034. The market expands as companies recognize autonomous AI's transformative power in streamlining processes, refining decision-making, and offering customized solutions. Public and private sector developments and investments create a supportive ecosystem for AI solutions. Deploying autonomous agents is sustainably benefiting and enhancing efficiency in multiple industries. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Using USD Coin (USDC), WLFI acquired various tokens, including Ethereum (ETH), Chainlink (LINK), and Aave (AAVE). WLFI’s Crypto Buying Spree Blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain reported that the transactions were recorded on December 12 via WLFI’s multi-signature wallet. Data from Etherscan shows the fund bought $10M worth of ETH at $3,801 per token, $1M worth of 41,335 LINK at $24.2 each, and $1 million in 3,357 AAVE at $297.8 per token. According to SpotOnChain, this is WLFI’s first purchase of LINK and AAVE. The firm also revealed that over the past 12 days, the organization had spent a total of $30 million to buy 8,105 ETH at an average price of $3,701. The buying spree follows a $30 million investment by Tron founder Justin Sun, who recently became WLFI’s largest investor. Sun expressed his enthusiasm for the development in a November 25 X post. “We are thrilled to invest $30 million in World Liberty Financial @worldlibertyfi as its largest investor.” The following day, WLFI confirmed that the Tron founder had joined the project as an advisor. Launched in September, World Liberty positions itself as a decentralized money market offering users the ability to borrow, lend, and earn interest on crypto assets. The project initially faced some financial challenges due to early sales failing to reach the expected $300 million target. This situation led to it scaling down its fundraising target to $30 million. Despite the problems, data from its website indicates it has successfully raised over $66.4 million by selling 4.43 billion tokens. Strategic Partnership with Chainlink to Boost DeFi Adoption In another related development, the platform recently announced a partnership with Chainlink on November 14 to accelerate DeFi adoption. According to the announcement, the DeFi protocol will serve as WLFI’s primary provider of on-chain data and cross-chain connectivity, supporting the project’s upcoming launch on the Ethereum mainnet. In the initial phase of this integration, it plans to adopt Chainlink’s Price Feeds to enable the secure onboarding of digital assets like USDC, USDT, ETH, and WBTC for its Aave v3 protocol instance. The Governance Platform is expected to approve this integration. Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov highlighted the network’s established security and reliability as key factors in selecting it as WLFI’s infrastructure provider. He also stated that the collaboration would enhance the Trump-backed project’s ability to attract users who value dependable technology within the DeFi ecosystem.

According to a filing with the Maine Attorney General’s office, Byte Federal was breached on September 30 by an unknown attacker who exploited a vulnerability in GitLab, a third-party project management and collaboration software, which allowed them to compromise one of its servers. The breach affected 58,000 customers, with compromised data including names, addresses, phone numbers, government-issued IDs, Social Security numbers, transaction activity, and user photographs. While no funds or user assets have been stolen, Byte Federal has urged customers to reset their login credentials and has already performed a hard reset on all customer accounts, according to a post-incident update . Further, the company is working with an independent cybersecurity team to determine the cause of the incident. At the time, the Florida-based ATM operator said they found “no evidence” of the leaked information being misused.

The development has triggered extreme excitement among XRP enthusiasts. In the last 24 hours alone, the price of XRP has climbed by over 5.4%. However, in a recent post on X, Vincent Van Code states that the real growth is yet to come. Why could the coming months be crucial for XRP? Let’s explore! XRP’s Price Surge Post-RLUSD Approval At the start of this month, the XRP price was at $1.95. On December 2, it touched a peak of $2.7239. Between December 3 and 5, the market showed a serious correction of 17.56%- the largest since November 5. The market has not yet recovered from the correction. Though, between December 6 and 7, XRP buyers pushed the price upwards nearly 16.34%, on December 9, XRP sellers regained control, pulling the market down almost 15.14%. Nonetheless, since December 10, the XRP market has consistently surged, marking at least 10.05% growth. The recent growth coincides with the New York authority’s approval for Ripple’s RLUSD. However, Van Code asserts that the current XRP growth does not have the support of fundamentals and the real growth will happen when Automated Market Makers and Liquidity Pools are set up. AMM/LP Setup and Future Growth Van Code claims that the AMM/LP setup will allow users to earn 5% APY on-chain without counterparty risks. The expert forecasts that the setup will drive huge money inflows into XRP Ledger. RLUSD Staking and Increased XRP Utility The expert notes that cryptocurrency exchanges will capitalise on RLUSD by offering staking options. Explaining the possibilities of earning returns and boosting XRP utility, the expert adds that the exchanges will lock XRP on the XRP Ledger. He also mentions that users may swap USDT for RLUSD, enabling the purchase of XRP and LP tokens. Rising XRP Demand and Market Impacts There is no doubt that any development in the usability of RLUSD will positively influence the demand for XRP. An increase in demand for XRP will reduce the supply of the token on exchanges. A reduction in supply will lead to an increase in the price of XRP. The expert emphasises that Market Makers and price-suppressing bots may struggle with the rising demand of XRP. Timeline of XRP’s Growth Van Codes predicts that the XRP market may witness sustained growth at least until February, 2025. In conclusion, RLUSD is not only boosting XRP’s price but could also transform its ecosystem. As demand rises and utility grows, XRP may see its strongest performance in years.

37538669,https://finbold.com/?p=218849,1733997991,Legendary Wall Street analyst sets jaw-dropping Bitcoin price target for 2025,"Cryptocurrency investors are filled with optimism leading into 2025 as the world’s premier digital asset – Bitcoin ( BTC ) – and many other major and minor coins and tokens have recorded massive gains in the last 12 months. The latest voice to join the extraordinarily bullish chorus for BTC is Fundstrat’s legendary analyst, Tom Lee. Specifically, Lee estimated that Bitcoin is likely to follow its historical price action patterns and climb to $250,000 before 2025 is over. The analyst cited the impact of the April halving and the more crypto-friendly administration entering the White House in January as some of the major drivers for such a surge. Additionally, this isn’t the first time Tom Lee has been optimistic about Bitcoin. He has been a BTC bull for a long time and predicted at the very start of December that BTC would cross above $100,000 before New Year. Is a Bitcoin rally to $250,000 in 2025 guaranteed? Considering that Lee’s December prediction came true last week with a brief but strong surge toward $104,000 – and holds true at press time as Bitcoin price today stands just above $101,000 – it isn’t surprising many prominent experts, investors, and influencers have called for the $250,000 price target. Indeed, several analysts from the community have been estimating BTC would climb to $250,000 next year since August, and Cycles Theory had identified 2025 as the ‘red year’ – the year in which Bitcoin would aim for a new and significantly higher all-time high (ATH) with the ultimate target being, again, $250,000. More recently, despite acknowledging some anxiety the world’s premier cryptocurrency might go into a steep correction from $100,000, the prominent investor and author of the best-selling personal finance book ‘ Rich Dad Poor Dad,’ Robert Kiyosaki reiterated $250,000 as his 2025 price target for the coin. For its part, Bitcoin has been on a remarkable – though not always smooth – journey in 2024. Already in March, it hit a decisive new ATH near $73,000, while – after a particularly eventful November – now, it is seeking ever-higher highs above $100,000. In the last 30 days, the cryptocurrency is up 14.40% and year-to-date (YTD), it is 139.74% in the green. Perhaps the most impressive part of the rally, however, started early in November, and between the first day of that month and press time, BTC surged 45.3%. BTC 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold Tom Lee extends bullish 2025 forecast to U.S. stocks Finally, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee is not only bullish about the cryptocurrency market. Indeed, the expert who famously predicted the end to the COVID-19 downturn and correctly identified the pre-election volatility in 2024 as a ‘buy-the-dip’ opportunity believes the first half of 2025 will also be very strong for U.S. stocks . To be precise, the analyst forecasted that the benchmark S&P 500 index will climb to 7,000 next year, though also cautioned there will be a significant correction in its second half to 6,600 points, for a total gain of approximately 9.4%.

42389688,6f051a14-32d8-4a03-b00a-e5082355cf6c,1733997947,This Bitcoin Indicator Echoes Early November Vibe That Presaged a 40% Price Explosion,"Bitcoin (BTC) traders could be in for another thrilling ride. A key technical indicator that presaged November's price surge is positioned precisely as it was then, signaling a potential volatility explosion ahead.  That indicator is the Bollinger bandwidth, a tool used to gauge impending changes in market jumpiness. For bitcoin, the bandwidth has narrowed to less than 10%, a level not seen since Nov. 4, the day before the U.S. elections. The largest cryptocurrency subsequently surged to $100,000 from $70,000 in four weeks.  Bollinger bands mark levels two standard deviations above and below the 20-day moving average of an asset's price. The bandwidth refers to the spread between upper and lower bands, with rising figures representing volatility boom and vice versa.  Volatility is typically mean-reverting, and historical data shows that when the daily bandwidth drops below 10%, it often leads to upturns followed by increased turbulence. It's important to note that volatility is price-agnostic, meaning it can manifest in either direction. For example, after the bandwidth dipped below 10% in early June, BTC prices dropped to $54,000 from $69,000 in three weeks.  Seasoned traders wait for the market to confirm a direction by topping either of the two bands. A move above the upper band typically signals a bullish volatility explosion on the horizon, a dip below the lower band suggests the opposite.  At press time, BTC is trading between the two bands, offering little guidance. That said, the prospect of renewed volatility might see savvy traders take derivative bets that profit from increased price swings in either direction.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/12/this-bitcoin-indicator-echoes-early-november-vibe-that-presaged-a-40-price-explosion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dfe5a5c97a21153218885574b0c00c549eb1a00b-1280x884.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With this decision, the Supreme Court effectively upheld a Ninth Circuit appellate ruling from August, which had revived the lawsuit initially dismissed in 2021 by a California district court. The class-action suit, brought forth by a group of Nvidia shareholders, alleges the company concealed over $1 billion in GPU sales tied to crypto mining during the market boom leading up to 2018. Investors claim that CEO Jensen Huang and the company downplayed the extent of sales to the cryptocurrency sector, a critical omission that came to light when the market collapsed later that year, causing Nvidia’s stock to plummet nearly 30% over two days. Nvidia had sought the Supreme Court’s intervention, arguing that the lawsuit relied on fabricated data and unsupported claims. However, the court dismissed the appeal in a one-line order without offering further explanation. Regulators and Evidence Bolster Shareholder Claims Adding weight to the shareholders’ case, the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) backed the class-action group in October . The agencies pointed to evidence, including statements from former Nvidia executives and a Bank of Canada report suggesting that Nvidia understated its cryptocurrency-related revenue by $1.35 billion. In response to the Supreme Court decision, an Nvidia spokesperson expressed disappointment, stating, “We would have preferred a decision on the merits affirming the trial court’s dismissal of the case, but we are fully prepared to continue our defense.” Nvidia emphasized its commitment to maintaining consistent standards in securities litigation, which it deems essential for economic stability and shareholder protection. A History of Regulatory Scrutiny This lawsuit is not Nvidia’s first brush with crypto-related controversy. In 2022, the company paid $5.5 million to settle SEC charges over its failure to adequately disclose the impact of cryptocurrency mining on its gaming business. Nvidia resolved the matter without admitting or denying the agency’s findings. The Supreme Court’s dismissal marks a turning point, as Nvidia now faces the prospect of a prolonged legal battle that could scrutinize its internal practices and its handling of the crypto boom .

Bitpanda said Fusion aggregates price data from major cryptocurrency exchanges, market makers, and liquidity providers, allowing users to buy and sell prices without the hassle of manually comparing multiple platforms. Liquidity and Efficiency According to the firm, one of the standout features of Bitpanda Fusion is its ability to pool liquidity from multiple markets. This approach gets rid of the liquidity constraints often faced by traders who rely on a single exchange. By providing access to a deeper liquidity pool, Fusion gives tighter spreads and more competitive pricing. This is impotant for traders executing large transactions. “With Fusion, we’re addressing two of the biggest challenges high-volume traders face: fragmented pricing and liquidity shortages,” Bitpanda stated. Trading Options Include EUR, USD, CHF, and GBP At launch, Fusion will offer users over 700 trading pairs. Traders can access these pairs directly in their preferred currency, including EUR, USD, CHF, and GBP, without the need for currency conversions. The tool also features stablecoins within these currencies, with plans to expand the list of supported pairs in the future, said the firm. A New Era for High-Volume Crypto Trading? With the launch of Fusion, Bitpanda said it is addressing liquidity issues, simplifying access to markets, and offering cost-effective, secure solutions. “It [Fusion] is the best tool on the market for experienced high-volume traders and means they no longer need to track prices across multiple exchanges or have multiple logins and it guarantees the execution price. It is everything you ever wanted in one account,” said Eric Demuth, CEO and co-founder of Bitpanda. Bitpanda Works With Citigroup and JPMorgan, Mulls IPO In October a Bloomberg report emerged that Bitpanda is currently working with Citigroup and JPMorgan.

Pepe Loves Santa (PEPESAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Loves Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Loves Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Loves Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Loves Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Loves Santa by entering its contract address – 9FuN9o4pQgF3NF1v2saWvb7b9hNKDJ1DGU6LSbur437Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESAN.

Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted this trend on Thursday, citing data from Santiment. Notably, these whales, holding over 100 million ADA, have now collectively expanded their holdings to a staggering 3.27 billion coins. The latest accumulation aligns with a broader trend observed in recent weeks. Over the past seven days, Cardano whales have poured nearly $300 million into ADA, capitalizing on market dips to solidify their positions. This pattern has been evident throughout the past month, with whales strategically buying during consolidations and taking profits during price surges. Interestingly, this whale activity contrasts sharply with retail behavior. Smaller investors, particularly those holding between $10,000 and $100,000 worth of ADA, have recently reduced their exposure. This divergence underscores the confidence of larger investors in Cardano’s potential, even as smaller holders take a more cautious approach. That said, this buying spree comes as ADA consolidates after a month-long rally, during which its price surged by an impressive 260% in just three weeks. The cryptocurrency climbed from lows around $0.50 to a peak of $1.32 on Tuesday. Despite this significant rebound, ADA remains well below its all-time high of $3.16, indicating substantial potential for further growth. That said, analysts see the recent accumulation as a strong bullish indicator. Popular crypto analyst Lark Davis recently outlined key resistance levels at $1.20 and $1.60, emphasizing that breaking through these thresholds could pave the way for significant price growth. The pundit further pointed to longer-term Fibonacci-based projections, suggesting ADA could reach $4.80, $7.70, or even $10 in this market cycle. Notably, hitting the $10 milestone would position ADA with a market capitalization of approximately $370 billion, equating to a 4% dominance of the total cryptocurrency market. In a Thursday tweet, Martinez highlighted the formation of an ascending triangle on ADA’s price chart, a classic indicator of an impending breakout. The pundit projected a short-term target of $1.50 for ADA in the coming weeks. Mid-last month, the analyst predicted that ADA could climb as high as $6 by July 2025, suggesting the possibility of a repeat of the explosive growth that saw ADA climb significantly during the 2020-2021 bull market. ADA was trading at $1.16 at press time, reflecting a 14.32% surge over the past 24 hours.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/cardano-whales-snap-up-over-100-million-worth-of-ada-in-a-day-amid-market-lull/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

37537938,https://crypto.news/?p=14318681,1733996597,Three reasons SUI could target $7.66 by 2025,"Sui, the native token of the Sui blockchain, has shown significant growth in recent months, claiming a new price peak during the latest broader market recovery. Notably, Sui ( SUI ) recently hit a new all-time high of $4.91, marking a 38% gain in December alone. This builds on an impressive 76% rise in November, signaling strong bullish momentum. Source: crypto.news As SUI continues to climb, its Fibonacci retracement levels suggest it could aim for $7.66, with this target possibly materializing if the broader bull market sustains into 2025. Several key factors drive this optimism. First, SUI’s recent rally confirms increasing market confidence. After reaching $4.91, the token experienced minor pullbacks but maintained critical support levels. This resilience shows strong buying momentum, even as its Relative Strength Index indicates overbought conditions. If SUI reclaims its ATH and surpasses the psychological $5 barrier, it could enter a price discovery phase. The Fibonacci retracement levels position $6.12 as the next target, with a possible upside to $6.75 and eventually $7.66. These represent the asset’s realistic milestones if the momentum continues. You might also like: 4 reasons behind Aave’s rally to 40-month highs Second, the recent integration with Backpack, a crypto exchange and wallet platform, is a major catalyst for Sui’s growth and could spur further upside. Backpack’s decision to adopt Sui’s high-performance blockchain opens significant opportunities for both platforms. With a user base spanning 150 countries and a trading volume of $60 billion in its first year, Backpack brings considerable credibility. For Sui , the partnership enhances its ecosystem by simplifying asset management and trading. Backpack users will gain seamless access to Sui’s network. This came less than a week after Phantom announced it would integrate Sui. Interestingly, this development also includes Backpack’s wallet, which supports multiple chains like Solana and Ethereum. The collaboration has already contributed to the SUI price surge. Third, Sui’s total value locked recently hit an all-time high of $1.835 billion, growing by 17% in a single day, according to data from DeFiLlama. This increase represents an additional $273 million in TVL, largely driven by its decentralized finance protocols. Suilend Protocol alone accounts for $583.61 million, with a 27% daily increase, while NAVI Protocol follows with $553.8 million after a 20.79% rise. The ecosystem also witnessed a record $466.65 million in daily decentralized exchange volume, showcasing growing user activity. Higher TVL and trading volumes demonstrate increasing trust in the network, attracting more participants and boosting SUI’s utility. These bullish metrics are capable of attracting further demand into the Sui ecosystem, potentially contributing to further price growth as 2025 nears. Sui also partnered with Franklin Templeton last month. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

A major investigation is underway into Korean crypto exchange Coinone after the price of the Movement ( MOVE ) token saw a sudden and extreme fluctuation, according to a report by Korean news outlet MTN. The Financial Supervisory Service, which is responsible for overseeing and regulating financial institutions, is reportedly looking into whether there were any unfair trades on Coinone when the price of MOVE jumped 46,000 times higher before quickly falling back down, the report reads.

37537825,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392136,1733996445,Ripple Moves Over $1.8 Billion in XRP with Nearly Zero Transaction Fees,"The post Ripple Moves Over $1.8 Billion in XRP with Nearly Zero Transaction Fees appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple , a blockchain-based digital payment network has recently completed a huge transfer of XRP, worth about $915 million, with an incredibly low transaction fee of just 0.0005 XRP. This highlights one of the biggest advantages of the XRP Ledger (XRPL)—its ultra-low fees. Such cost-effective transactions are becoming a key reason why XRP is gaining more attention in the crypto world. XRP’s Lightning-Fast Transfer with Almost No Cost The recent transaction, which was highlighted by crypto analyst Leonidas, quickly caught the attention of the crypto community. The 380 million XRP transfer was made to the wallet ‘rP4X2…sKxv3 ,’ and although the recipient was labeled as “unknown,” data from Bithomp, a leading XRPL explorer, suggests that Ripple itself might be behind the wallet. Following the initial transfer, the recipient wallet moved 200 million XRP valued at $486 million to a new address, again with a minimal fee of just 0.000015 XRP. This brings the total fees for moving $1.88 billion worth of XRP to only $0.0013. The XRP Ledger’s efficiency makes it an attractive option for high-value transfers, especially when compared to other blockchains like Bitcoin, where fees can reach $3.50 per transaction, or Ethereum, which charges about $1.48. Making XRP More Accessible What makes this even more impressive is the broader context. XRP’s fees are already the lowest among major blockchain networks, with an average cost of $0.005145 per transaction. Ripple is also making moves to reduce the cost of using XRPL further. Recently, the network lowered the fees to open an XRPL account by 90%, making it easier for new users to join the network. XRPL’s Low Fee Impact On XRP’s Price The XRP Ledger’s extremely low fees could play a big role in increasing XRP’s value. As more people use XRP for quick and cheap transactions, demand for the coin could rise. This growing interest could push the price of XRP higher in the long term, especially as more businesses and users realize the benefits of using XRPL over other networks with higher costs. With XRP’s value already up 7% in the last 24 hours, it seems like these low fees are helping drive interest and demand.",POSITIVE,XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TRADING | WALLET | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-moves-over-1-8-billion-in-xrp-with-nearly-zero-transaction-fees/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37537852,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626352,1733996182,Kraken fined $8M in Australia for unlawful margin trading,"The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) launched legal proceedings against the Australian operator of the Kraken crypto exchange. The Federal Court has ordered Bit Trade Pty Ltd (Kraken’s AUS operator) to pay $8 million for unlawfully offering a “margin extension” product without proper regulatory measures. The watchdog alleged that the exchange illegally issued a credit facility to more than 1,100 Australian customers. The Federal Court found breaches of design and distribution obligations (DDO). ASIC Chair Joe Longo stated that “TMDs are vital to protect investors from inappropriate products. This outcome reminds digital asset firms of their compliance obligations under current law.” Kraken’s AUS operator fined $8M According to reports , over 1,100 customers used the margin extension product which helped the exchange to generate fees and interest of more than $7 million. Users’ losses have been calculated to be more than $5 million. One customer had lost nearly $4 million while trading. ASIC flagged the lack of a required target market determination (TMD). It added that Bit Trade Pty Ltd, which operated the Kraken exchange, has been offering the “margin extension” product since October 2021. It was in August 2024 when the Federal Court found that Bit Trade’s product was a credit facility. A TMD was required by the product to offer margin extensions in national currencies. Justice John Nicholas criticized Bit Trade’s “seriously deficient compliance system” and noted its breaches were “motivated by a desire to maximize revenue.” The firm continued offering the product despite knowing it likely breached the law. ASIC intensifies crypto oversight This landmark penalty highlights ASIC’s intent to regulate digital asset firms under existing laws. The penalty comes just after the watchdog pushed for industry consultation with the digital-assets sector. The agency is seeking industry feedback on draft updates to its guidance for such products. Meanwhile, Bit Trade must also pay ASIC’s legal costs. The watchdog notes that products, offered by the exchange, are captured under the current law. This suggests that these products need to be designed and marketed properly to the right users in order to ensure that Australians receive appropriate protection. This comes in as the United States moves toward pro-crypto regulations under the Donald Trump administration. Kraken is facing legal heat from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) too. The agency urged a district court to dismiss three of the defenses made by the exchange over the allegations of operating unlawfully. The platform has suggested that there is a lack of clarity around securities laws and how they apply to virtual assets, however, the commission has rejected such claims.

37531580,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=661226,1733995846,"3 Reasons Why Bitcoin ETFs Will See Explosive Growth In 2025, According To Bitwise","The Bitcoin (BTC) market has undergone a remarkable recovery this year, largely due to the increased popularity of Bitcoin ETFs. BTC reached an all-time high of $73,000 in the first quarter of the year, sparking a bullish trend that continues today, with a recent high of $104,000. The presidential election of Donald Trump has had a huge impact on this rise especially over the past month, as he has positioned himself as the first pro-crypto President, picturing America as the “crypto capital of the world.” Trump’s favorable position toward digital assets has infused increased optimism among investors, resulting in increased buying pressure from Bitcoin ETF providers such as BlackRock and Fidelity. Notably, the top 12 Bitcoin ETFs have emerged as the biggest BTC holders, with a combined asset value of over $100 billion. This figure represents one of the most successful ETF launches in financial history, with the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs now collectively owning approximately 1.1 million BTC—equivalent to about 5% of all Bitcoin in circulation. Bitcoin ETFs Expected To Surpass 2024 Inflows In a recent report, crypto asset manager Bitwise outlined three key factors that suggest Bitcoin ETFs will continue to see explosive growth in 2025. Initially, it’s important to note that the first year of ETF operations is typically the slowest. Related Reading: Bitwise Forecast: Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Poised For Record Highs In 2025 Historical comparisons with gold ETFs launched in 2004 show a significant increase in inflows over subsequent years. For instance, gold ETFs began with $2.6 billion in their first year, followed by $5.5 billion in the second year, and progressively higher amounts in the following years. The firm suggests that if the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States follow a similar trajectory, 2025 could see inflows that far exceed those of 2024. Another factor contributing to potential growth is the anticipated participation of major financial wirehouses. Firms such as Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo have yet to fully deploy their wealth management teams to promote Bitcoin ETFs. As regulatory environments become more favorable under Trump, these institutions are expected to unlock access to Bitcoin ETFs for their clients, potentially directing trillions of dollars into the crypto market. Investors ‘Laddering Up’ Finally, Bitwise has identified a clear trend among investors known as “laddering up.” This pattern indicates that initial small contributions to Bitcoin frequently lead to increasing investments over time. The asset manager believes that many investors who entered the Bitcoin ETF market in 2024 will double down on their investments in 2025. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Last Phase Of ABC Wave Points To A Bounce To New ATH At $5.85 The firm’s assertion that “3% is the new 1%” indicates increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as a genuine asset class, which they believe will lead investors to dedicate a larger amount of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies. At the time of writing, BTC had consolidated above $100,900 following a 7% dip to $91,000 at the start of the month. Over the previous 24 hours, the market’s biggest cryptocurrency has seen an almost 4% price increase.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency almost crossed $102,000 after reaching an intraday high of $101,819 before retreating to its current level. The move past $100,000 comes after BTC spent several days between $94,000 and $98,000. Other cryptocurrencies also registered substantial increases over the past 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH) is up over 7% in the past 24 hours and is on the verge of going above $4,000. Ripple (XRP) also recovered from its recent slump up 4%. Solana (SOL), which had seen a substantial decline, has also recovered and is up almost 6%, trading at $230. With the markets posting a strong recovery, the crypto market cap is up nearly 6% and currently sits at $3.65 trillion. Crypto Markets Recover Bitcoin (BTC) climbed above $100,000 for the first time since it set a new all-time high of $103,900. BTC’s rally also pulled up other altcoins, with most registering substantial gains. Crypto stocks also registered a sharp jump, with Coinbase and MicroStrategy registering gains of 3% and 9% respectively. The crypto markets got a boost thanks to the November consumer price index numbers, which came in as expected. The consumer price index numbers registered an increase of 0.3% from October and a 2.7% increase from a year ago. However, despite the recent price jump, investors expect BTC to struggle around the $100,000 mark in the short term but remain optimistic that its value could double by the end of the year. US Bankers Remain Cautious On BTC US bankers remained cautious about Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies when speaking at the Reuters NEXT conference held in New York earlier this week. The cautious tone comes despite the expectation of a crypto-friendly administration under the incoming Trump administration. Trump secured the backing of major players from the crypto ecosystem by promising to be a “crypto” president and end the Biden administration's crackdown on the sector. However, despite the assurances, banks remain cautious about dealing with an inherently volatile asset and market. Goldman Sachs Chief Executive, David Solomon, stated, “The regulatory framework has to evolve, and everyone’s speculating as to how that regulatory framework will evolve, but it's still unclear. But, for now, our ability to act in these markets is extremely limited.” Solomon added that if the rules change, Goldman Sachs will evaluate dealing in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). BNY recently began offering custody of crypto assets held by exchange-traded products. The bank is also investing in an array of digital assets. However, its CEO believes anything new must be done with appropriate guard rails and tested through a few macroeconomic cycles. During the Biden administration, regulators made it difficult for lenders to hold crypto tokens. They also issued accounting guidance, making it costly for banks to offer crypto custody services. However, that is expected to change once Trump enters the White House, with the crypto industry pushing for several policies to promote the adoption of digital currencies. Trump announced he would make former PayPal executive David Sacks the White House Crypto Czar and nominate pro-crypto attorney Paul Atkins as SEC Chair. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) registered a strong rebound from a low of $95,821 as markets recovered after November’s consumer price index numbers came along expected lines. The numbers raised expectations of another Federal Reserve rate cut, boosting crypto prices. BTC has surged considerably since Trump’s election victory. The President-elect has also made significant moves to undo crackdowns imposed by the Biden administration and outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler. BTC surged to an all-time high of $103,900 in the first week of December before dropping to trade between $94,000 and $98,000. It struggled to regain the $100,000 mark as traders booked profits. However, the latest inflation numbers are boosting the price again. Bitcoin (BTC) experienced significant volatility last Thursday as it sent a new all-time high before dropping to an intraday low of $92,285, briefly dipping below the 20-day SMA before settling at $97,093. However, it recovered on Friday, rising by almost 3% and settling at $99,695, falling just short of the $100,000 mark. BTC remained positive over the weekend, registering a marginal increase on Saturday and then rising by 1.32% on Sunday to climb above $100,000 and settle at $101,043. Source: TradingView BTC’s foray above $100,000 was short-lived, as sellers returned to the market on Monday. The crypto market’s sudden crash on Monday saw BTC dip to an intraday low of $94,177 as it slipped below the 20-day SMA. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $97,434, ultimately registering a drop of 3.57% and settling above the 20-day SMA. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as BTC fell to a low of $94,307 before settling at $96,914. The price recovered on Wednesday as markets rallied following the release of November’s consumer price index numbers. As a result, BTC registered an increase of over 4% to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $100,900. The current session sees BTC marginally down as sellers look to push it below $100,000. If sellers retain control, BTC could slip below $100,000 and drop to $97,000, where the 20-day SMA could prop up the price. On the other hand, if buyers regain the upper hand, BTC could climb to $105,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) is looking to go above the resistance at $4,000 as it makes a strong recovery from Tuesday’s low of $3,521. ETH experienced significant volatility on Thursday as it rose to an intraday high of $3,957 and fell to an intraday low of $3,644 before settling at $3,787, registering a decline of 1.48%. However, it recovered on Friday, registering an increase of almost 6% to climb above $4,000 and settling at $4,003. ETH registered a marginal drop on Saturday, slipping below $4,000 and settling at $3,999. However, it reclaimed $4,000 on Sunday after a marginal increase pushed the price to $4,007. Source: TradingView ETH could not remain above this level as bearish sentiment intensified on Monday after a sudden crash in the market. As a result, ETH dropped over 7% to an intraday low of $3,504 before recovering to climb above the 20-day SMA and settle at $3,716. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price dropped to a low of $3,521 before settling at $3,630 after a drop of 2.32%. ETH made a strong recovery on Wednesday, rising almost 6% and moving to $3,834. The current session sees ETH up nearly 3% as buyers look to push it above $4,000.

Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) has rebounded strongly from a low of $203 as it looks to move above the 20-day SMA and the resistance at $240. SOL faced considerable volatility almost all of last week as it attempted to move above the 20-day SMA but was repeatedly pushed back. SOL reached an intraday high of $244 last Thursday as it briefly went past the 20-day SMA. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching this level, and SOL fell back, dropping to $236 and registering an increase of 2.84%. Friday saw SOL push above the 20-day SMA again, but it fell back to $237, registering only a marginal increase. Source: TradingView With resistance persisting at this level, SOL could only register a marginal increase on Saturday before dropping on Sunday to settle at $237 after a drop of 0.48%. Bearish sentiment intensified considerably on Monday as SOL plummeted 8.55%, driven by a broader market crash. As a result, the price dropped to an intraday low of $205 before settling at $216. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as SOL dropped 1.47% and settled at $213. However, it recovered on Wednesday, rebounding from the 50-day SMA to register an increase of 6.38% and settle at $227, going beyond the immediate resistance at $220. The current session sees SOL up by 1.41% as buyers look to move above the 20-day SMA and reclaim $240. A move above these levels could see SOL retest the resistance at $250.

37537404,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374406,1733995745,Bullish Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Prediction (Analyst),"TL;DR SHIB was predicted to witness a 180% rally supported by strong on-chain metrics and Shibarium’s growing adoption. On the other hand, declining network growth and fewer large transactions suggest possible downward pressure. Is SHIB Gearing up for a New Rally? The second-largest meme coin has performed quite well in the last three months, registering a price increase of over 100%. It reached a local peak on December 7, but shortly after, it dipped substantially amid the latest market correction. In the past 24 hours, there has been a fresh resurgence, with SHIB currently trading at around $0.00002918 (per CoinGecko’s data). SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko One popular analyst touching upon the asset’s recent price fluctuations is the X user JAVON MARKS. The market observer claimed that SHIB has confirmed a bullish pattern, which could be followed by “another major upside move.” JAVON MARKS reiterated their prognosis that the valuation could spike by almost 180% and reach $0.000081: “With this target at $0.000081 continuing to be in play, we could be soon witnessing a more than 180% climb unfold in front of our eyes, and it may just already be in-effect as we speak.” Some important on-chain metrics support the bullish forecast. An example is the SHIB exchange netflow which has been predominantly negative in the last week. This signals a potential shift from centralized platforms toward private wallets, which in turn , reduces the immediate selling pressure. Another factor is Shibarium’s progress. The layer-2 scaling solution, whose ultimate goal is to foster the development of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, recently reached another major milestone. As CryptoPotato reported , the total number of wallet addresses surpassed two million. Prior to that, the total transactions processed on the network crossed 600 million. Something for the Bears, too Despite the aforementioned bullish elements, there are some metrics suggesting that SHIB’s price may head south soon. According to IntoTheBlock, Shiba Inu’s Net Network Growth (a momentum signal “that gives a pulse of the true growth of the token’s underlying network”) is down 0.76% on a daily scale , entering the bearish zone. Large Transactions (a momentum indicator showing the number of transactions greater than $100,000) have also declined in the past 24 hours. The “InTheMoney” metric (which measures the change in the number of SHIB investors currently sitting on paper profits) has plunged, too. Currently, around 69% of those invested in the asset are in the green, while 24% remain underwater.

The non-fungible token set became the world’s second most-valued NFTs on Wednesday, with the minimum — or floor — price for any of the 8,888 comic penguins topping $100,000 and flipping the collections' value above its comic monkey forerunner, the Bored Apes Yacht Club.  That means buying a single NFT now costs more than a bitcoin, which currently trades at just over $100,000.  The floor price has jumped 76% in the past seven days to over 26 ether (ETH), or just above $105,000. Bored Apes and CryptoPunks — the most valued NFTs — both fell 12% in the same period.      Demand for the NFTs surged after a CoinDesk exclusive on Pudgy Penguin’s plans to release a PENGU token on the Solana blockchain later this month. The token allocation strategy includes a substantial share for existing NFT holders, which may have incentivized current owners to hold or increase their investments, driving up demand.  Nearly a quarter — 23.5% — of the 88 billion PENGU tokens will be reserved for owners of the project's NFT collections such as Pudgy Penguins, Lil Pudgys and Pudgy Rods. A further 22% will be available to the Solana and Ethereum communities, and 12% will be set aside to provide liquidity on decentralized exchanges.  In the NFT market, the floor price is the cheapest cost of an NFT within a specific collection. It is fixed by the NFT's owner based on market forces such as demand or rarity of traits in the collection. The floor remains in place until a lower one is set.  This is different from the general token or stock market, where demand and supply automatically change prices every second, instead of a single holder deciding the minimum price for an asset.  Pudgy Penguins came into existence in 2021. Each penguin is hand-drawn and features distinctive traits such as backgrounds, body, face, head and skin.  The collection has successfully expanded its presence beyond just digital collectibles into physical products and mainstream branding.  Parent company Igloo last year introduced Pudgy Toys, a toy line based on the digital art collection. It has since sold more than $10 million in collectible igloos and plushies through major retailers including Walmart, Target, Amazon and Walgreens.",POSITIVE,ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/12/a-single-pudgy-penguins-nft-now-costs-more-than-a-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/df68f8a318b4b310a3b959798255cd19595fde3d-889x500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In the meantime, the SUI price attracted a huge buying volume as the trading volume surged by above $3.6 billion. As a result, the price led an impressive 35% rise since the last trading day and smashed a new ATH at $4.86. After achieving fresh highs, the token does not appear to halt its rising trend, as the bulls are eyeing much higher targets well above $5 or $6. The Sui network platform is becoming increasingly popular as it has expanded its real-world use cases with multiple integrations with financial platforms. With this, the Sui network shows an unstoppable momentum, with the chart signalling more gains ahead. Given that the immediate target at $5 seems to have been activated, whether the bulls make it to the double-digit figure above $10? The historical price action of the token suggests a breakout from a huge bullish pattern and as a result, a steep ascending trend could be fast approaching. The token broke out of the double-bottom pattern and after a small retracement, it has begun to swell. The technicals are currently extremely strong, which supports the bullish narrative. Hence the token is believed to maintain a healthy ascending trend as the RSI has made it to the overbought zone. As the levels are not displaying any possibility of a bearish divergence, the SUI price is expected to maintain a healthy upswing. Besdies, the rising on-balance volume or OBV, supports the bullish narrative, which suggests the rally to be in a progressive stage. The token has already reached the 1.2 FIB at the current highs and the next level to watch is around $5.34, which is at 1.414 FIB. However, the major target remains at around 2 FIB at $2 and securing these levels could attract some bearish action, which may halt the steep ascending trend. If the market continues to possess strong bullish momentum, then the SUI price rally may revamp a strong rebound and proceed towards the $10 milestone that could be the peak of the prevailing bull run.",POSITIVE,SUI,ALTCOIN | MARKET | TRADING | SUI,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/sui-price-smashed-a-new-ath-can-the-bulls-escalate-the-levels-beyond-10-as-5-remains-activate-for-2024/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37538997,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51961,1733995155,$1.56 Billion XRP In 2 Hours. Here’s What Happened,"Recent whale movements in the XRP ecosystem have drawn the community’s attention. Whale Alert (@whale_alert), a prominent whale-tracking platform, reported three significant XRP transactions totaling 640 million tokens. These whopping transactions play out within 2 hours. These transactions have fueled speculation about market activity, institutional involvement, or potential upcoming announcements. The largest of these transactions involved 380 million XRP ($915.17 million), transferred from Ripple to an unknown wallet. This has raised questions about whether Ripple is reallocating funds, preparing for strategic initiatives, or supporting institutional clients. Ripple’s history of partnerships with financial institutions further amplifies the intrigue surrounding this transfer. Two additional transactions occurred around the same time: 60 million XRP ($145.5 million) was transferred before it, and 200 million XRP ($485.37 million) was transferred after it. These were moved between unknown wallets. What Are the XRP Whales Doing? Such movements often suggest private transfers, possibly by large holders or institutions seeking to realign their portfolios. However, the lack of transparency in these transfers has left the crypto community speculating about their intent. Large-scale whale transactions are often precursors to major market moves or announcements. Historically, significant XRP transfers have coincided with developments such as partnerships, regulatory decisions, or new product launches. These movements could also be an anticipation of a massive price surge . The timing of these transactions, combined with XRP’s recent price movements, has further intensified scrutiny. XRP’s Strong Market Performance XRP recently surged past the $2 mark for the first time since 2018, reaching a high of $2.86. Despite market turbulence over the past few days, the digital asset remained strong and swiftly recovered. At the time of press, XRP is trading at $2.44, up 5.59% over the past 24 hours. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This price rally has also reignited interest in XRP, particularly as the crypto space anticipates regulatory clarity under a new U.S. administration. Gary Gensler, the current SEC Chair, has announced his resignation effective January 20, 2025. His tenure was marked by legal actions against Ripple and other crypto entities, creating uncertainty in the market. However, President-elect Donald Trump’s nomination of Paul Atkins, known for his crypto-friendly stance, has been welcomed by the crypto community. Atkins’ leadership at the SEC will bring a highly anticipated shift in the regulator’s strategy, and could finally end the legal battle that has suppressed XRP. The recent whale activity and regulatory developments suggest that significant changes could be imminent for XRP. While the exact motives behind the whale transactions remain unclear, their scale indicates institutional-level movements rather than retail activity, and they could be preparing for big things in January after Gensler’s resignation.

37537277,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626356,1733994975,"Xi and Trump finally agree to fix China-US relations, set to meet on Inauguration Day","Donald Trump is making history before even stepping back into the Oval. The President-elect has invited Chinese President Xi Jinping to attend his inauguration next month, breaking 150 years of tradition. Reports claim that multiple sources have confirmed the unprecedented invitation, which could set the tone for a new chapter in US-China relations. This invitation is bold, especially considering Trump’s campaign rhetoric. He promised to slap a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods and has threatened another 10% if Beijing doesn’t curb fentanyl exports to the US. Folks are wondering if this is a strategic olive branch or a calculated power play. A first in US-China history State Department records show no foreign leader has attended a US presidential inauguration since at least 1874. Typically, such ceremonies are reserved for ambassadors and diplomatic envoys. The Chinese foreign ministry has yet to comment, but all eyes are on Beijing. Xi’s last US visit was for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in November 2023, where he held talks with outgoing President Joe Biden. Relations between the two nations remained tense during Biden’s term, with no state visit to China largely due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. Historically, leaders from both countries alternated visits, making it Trump’s turn to visit Beijing under usual protocols. The presidents haven’t met in person since June 2019 at the G20 summit in Japan . Although Trump recently confirmed communication with Xi during an NBC interview, he declined to share details of their conversation. The invitation could signify an attempt to reset relations as the US and China prepare for what many fear could be another period of economic and political standoff. China, on the other hand, isn’t backing down. Xi has emphasized his “four red lines,” which include no interference in the Communist Party’s control, no push toward democracy, no efforts to contain China’s economic rise, and no support for Taiwan’s independence. This rigid stance shows Beijing’s determination to defend its sovereignty, even as it remains open to dialogue. In a speech earlier this week, Xi reiterated that trade and technology wars yield “no winners.” Meanwhile, Beijing has escalated tensions by restricting the export of high-tech materials with military applications. Unprecedented preparation Historically, China has avoided sending heads of state to such events. When Biden was inaugurated in 2021, Beijing confirmed that the Chinese embassy had received an invitation but sent no high-ranking officials. The same approach was taken during Trump’s first inauguration in 2017. Hua Chunying, then a foreign ministry spokesperson, emphasized that the US traditionally only invites diplomatic envoys to such ceremonies. This makes Trump’s direct invitation to Xi all the more extraordinary. For now, the ball is in Beijing’s court. Whether Xi accepts the invitation or opts for a more cautious approach, the decision will likely be felt across global markets and economies .

37536902,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392182,1733994815,Crypto Market Trends: Why Prices Are Up but Activity Slows,"The post Crypto Market Trends: Why Prices Are Up but Activity Slows appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Various cryptocurrencies keep making certain moves in the market that bring them into the headlines. This time, Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana are taking the stage. Some crypto people might be thinking why prices are up despite slow activities, Let’s try to understand why this is happening. Bitcoin Steady, Ethereum Gains, Solana Keeps Climbing Bitcoin (BTC) is sitting comfortably at $101,088. It’s just a little below its recent peak of $101,356. Prices are strong, but the trading volume isn’t following the same path. In fact, it’s down 17.31%, now at $67 billion. Even with the drop, Bitcoin’s market dominance is undeniable—55.08% share and a market cap near $2 trillion. That’s massive. Source : Tradingview Ethereum (ETH) is doing its own thing. It’s trading at $3,913, which is slightly up from $3,875. Over the past week, Ethereum has climbed an impressive 17%. That’s a big win for traders who stayed optimistic. But like Bitcoin, its trading volume isn’t keeping pace. It’s dropped by 29.33% to $24 billion. Even so, the bullish vibes around Ethereum seem stronger than ever. Then there’s Solana (SOL), which keeps grabbing attention. It’s now priced at $230.01, continuing its upward streak. Enthusiasm for Solana is real, but its trading volume also took a hit—down 32.28%, leaving it at $3.4 billion. Still, Solana’s consistent growth shows how much potential people see in it, especially with its role in decentralized finance (DeFi). XRP is definitely a crypto token worth talking about. Despite a sharp drop in trading volume – 45.24%, XRP reached $2.44. The current recorded trading volume is $12.96 billion. What’s Driving the Price Hikes? It might feel strange at first—prices rising as volumes fall. But the reasons behind this trend are clearer when you dig a little deeper. Institutional investors are stepping in more than ever. Bitcoin ETFs have seen massive inflows, with Fidelity alone adding $121 million. These funds make it easier for large investors to join the market, driving up prices even when overall trading looks quieter. Even the retail investors are not stopping to invest in. As the economic conditions are stable, they are getting the courage and seeing crypto as a smart investment. As the U.S. inflation is at 2.7%, the digital currencies are becoming a hedge against the uncertainty. Source : Farside Trading habits are changing in interesting ways. Instead of seeing lots of frequent, smaller trades, the trend is leaning toward fewer but larger transactions. This shift seems to be driven mainly by institutional investors, who are playing a bigger role in the market. It’s part of why trading volumes are down, even though prices keep climbing. You could see it as a sign of the market maturing—moving toward long-term investments rather than short-term speculation. Technology is having a big impact too. Ethereum and Solana are gaining from improvements in decentralized finance and scalability. These upgrades make them more attractive for people looking at the bigger picture. Even meme coins are bringing some excitement back into the market. Take Solana-based PNUT, for example. It jumped 35% recently, thanks to getting listed on major exchanges. It shows there’s still plenty of energy and interest in crypto. And don’t overlook the bigger economic backdrop. With inflation easing and markets stabilizing, riskier assets like cryptocurrencies are becoming more appealing. Many investors now see crypto as a way to protect themselves from future uncertainty. This growing confidence, from both everyday investors and big institutions, is a major reason why prices are holding strong. What to Expect So, what’s next for the crypto market? If things stay on this path, we might see prices going even higher. Institutional investors seem likely to keep driving growth, especially if the economy remains stable. Crypto could become even more established as a go-to investment option, attracting both seasoned traders and curious newcomers. That said, the market is unpredictable as ever. Prices can change quickly, and unexpected factors could shake things up. For now, though, the focus seems to be shifting toward long-term value rather than quick wins. With all the ongoing developments in technology and adoption, the market feels like it’s heading into an exciting new phase. Who knows what’s around the corner but it is now clear why prices are up despite the low trading volume. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana—they’re all part of a story that’s far from over. The question isn’t whether things will change. It’s how soon and how much. Stay tuned because this space never stays quiet for long.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-market-trends-why-prices-are-up-but-activity-slows/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

But in the present session, the ADA coin is rising again beyond $1. Investors continue to pour money into the DTX Exchange despite this rebound as the coin generates over $10.10 million in its presale. DTX Exchange has become a key player attracting a vast majority of investors with its unprecedented growth potential and unique features. Experts claim that the platform is set to rally further by 500%. Cardano’s Breakout Potential Remains High: ADA Shows Bullish Reversal Cardano (ADA) comes into view with some aspects of a potential bullish turnaround on its 4-hour chart. The bullish convergence suggests that though the present levels might not mark the ultimate bottom, the price is creeping closer to a pivotal about-face. Recent insights from market commentators present ADA’s current positioning as a mix of resilience and opportunity. Cardano is finding it difficult to hold parabolic support at $1, which is the level viewed by the bulls as key. The support on the daily chart lies at $0.86, while for those targeting the best entry levels, the range between $0.56 and $0.68 presents an area with a favorable risk-to-reward scenario. The analysis emphatically highlights the importance of these zones. Holding above $1 could indicate strong buyer interest, while a drop toward $0.78–$0.80 offers a secondary buying opportunity. This range aligns with liquidation zones on the daily chart, thus making it ideal for traders seeking quick long positions. The price trajectory of Cardano has been impressive as it surged 250% in recent months. While this kind of explosive growth does call for corrections, these have been seen as healthy readjustments that set the ground for the next leg. While the cryptocurrency market remains highly volatile, ADA is a beacon of prospects. The ability to navigate through support levels while keeping the bullish momentum going testifies to the strength of its network and investor confidence. This is the time to be vigilant for any trader and investor as Cardano positions itself for the next breakout. DTX Exchange (DTX) Steals The Spotlight With 500% Rally DTX Exchange (DTX) sparked excitement among investors and community members soon after its 300,000 wallet count made headlines on the web.

The initial launch includes tokenized trackers tied to the Nasdaq-listed Coinbase (COIN), one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, the chip-maker Nvidia (NVDA), a bellwether for all things artificial intelligence (AI) and risk assets, and the blue-chip index, the S&P 500 (SPX), the company said in the press release shared with CoinDesk on Thursday.  The platform plans to list tokenized Treasury bills, or short-term U.S. government securities with maturities of one year or less, designed for liquidity-focused investors. Futures plans include a potential listing of money market funds, bonds, stablecoins and private-credit tokens.  When trading these tokenized trackers, Assetera's users will receive Backed's bTokens, representing shares in the underlying assets. These bTokens are fully collateralized and issued under an approved European Union prospectus, ensuring transparent and secure 24/7 trading.  These tokens offer significant flexibility, as they can be stored in any wallet and moved beyond traditional market hours and across chains, with the help of Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol.

Mayor Ken Sim introduced the initiative, which envisions Vancouver becoming a “Bitcoin-friendly city” by potentially creating a Bitcoin reserve and enabling cryptocurrency payments for municipal services. Bitcoin-Friendly City The motion, presented at a Dec. 11 council meeting , passed with six votes in favor, two against, and three absences. Mayor Sim argued that adopting Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, safeguarding Vancouver’s financial future. “We have affordability challenges, and I truly believe that Bitcoin could address these issues,” he remarked during the session. Sim underscored his point by highlighting a stark financial trend: while Vancouver housing market saw a staggering 381% increase in value from 1995 to 2022, gold prices remained relatively stagnant. Additionally, the city’s $3.1 billion fixed-income securities portfolio has suffered a $185 million market value loss. “There’s something fundamentally wrong here,” Sim stated, emphasizing the need for innovative financial strategies. To demonstrate his confidence in Bitcoin’s potential, Sim pledged a personal donation of $10,000 worth of Bitcoin to the city, regardless of the motion’s outcome. Diverging Opinions: Support vs. Skepticism While the motion passed, it sparked intense debate. Councilor Pete Fry expressed concerns about cryptocurrency’s association with illicit activities and a lack of legal clarity surrounding its use in municipal operations. “In the absence of clear regulations, this could set a dangerous precedent,” Fry warned. Councilor Adriane Carr voiced apprehension over Bitcoin mining’s environmental toll , citing its high electricity consumption as a critical issue. “The environmental impact cannot be ignored,” she argued, opposing the motion. Despite these reservations, the council agreed to commission a detailed report on the feasibility, risks, and benefits of Bitcoin adoption. The findings are expected by the end of the first quarter of 2025. Mayor Sim framed the initiative as a forward-looking measure to ensure Vancouver’s resilience in a rapidly changing economic landscape.

The president-elect announced the family crypto venture in mid-September through a livestream on an X space. The World Liberty Financial venture will offer lending and borrowing services as well as investment opportunities to crypto investors. Trump’s three sons, Eric Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and Barron Trump, are all on the founding team alongside real estate executive Steve Witkoff and his two sons. The firm has already begun receiving investments from enterprising individuals. Justin Sun, a notable crypto figure and Chinese entrepreneur, invested $30 million into the firm. The investment tipped the venture over the threshold, allowing Trump and his family to begin seeing proceeds from the firm. At its core, World Liberty Financial has its token, WLFI. The token sale launched on October 15th and was open to anyone who qualified for the whitelist that began in September. The venture token sale was only available to U.S. accredited investors with a net worth of at least $1 million, excluding residence. The whitelist had over 100,000 investors before the token sale.

The project has allocated 20% of the token supply to the founding team, including Donald Trump and his sons. 17% has been set aside for user rewards, and the remaining 63% is publicly sold to investors. After the president-elect announced the venture, the news sparked a wave of controversies and concerns. Government ethics experts accuse the president-elect of expanding his business venture by receiving money from those hoping to influence U.S. policy changes. Trump’s team told the BBC that he distanced himself from his multi-billion-dollar real estate empire when he was elected and waived his salary.

Speaking at the Global Economic Policy Forum 2024, V. Anantha Nageswaran, the Chief Economic Advisor of the Ministry of Finance, said regulators “must not stand in the way of so-called innovations in crypto and Bitcoin.” He emphasized the need to balance innovation with societal needs, pointing out that financial illiteracy is a major challenge in India and even in developed countries. “We need to ensure that the criteria set for regulators do not obstruct innovation,” he added. Further, Nageswaran stressed the importance of transparency, highlighting that regulators should actively share information and ensure their actions align with societal goals. According to him, “the same principles of transparency and social cost-benefit” that apply to financial innovations must also apply to regulators themselves. By adhering to these standards and recognizing the limits of their unelected powers, he argued, regulators can support progress in fast-evolving sectors like cryptocurrency while safeguarding public interests.

The lawsuit accuses Nvidia of misleading investors by downplaying its reliance on crypto-related sales during its rapid revenue growth in 2017 and 2018, a period before the cryptocurrency market crashed. Shareholders allege that Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, misrepresented how much the company’s record-breaking earnings relied on its GeForce GPUs being used for crypto mining instead of gaming. After the 2018 crypto market collapse, Nvidia disclosed that it missed revenue targets, causing its stock to drop over 28% in two days. Huang referred to this financial setback as a ""crypto hangover."" The Supreme Court’s decision follows a November hearing where justices examined whether the case warranted their intervention. Nvidia had argued that the lawsuit lacked the necessary details to proceed to the evidence-collection phase, but the Court rejected this claim. The case will now be heard in a federal district court in Oakland, California. The shareholders’ attorney described this development as a “major victory for corporate accountability.” Nvidia faced significant challenges during the crypto crash, but the company has since experienced a remarkable recovery. This year, Nvidia’s stock has surged nearly 190%, driven by strong GPU demand for mining, gaming, and artificial intelligence applications. The company’s latest GeForce 4000-series GPUs have outperformed competitors like AMD in profitability rankings and have captured a larger share of the market. Nvidia recently announced a 95% increase in revenue for Q3, reaching $35.1 billion, with its Data Center segment showing 111% year-over-year growth. The company has also forecasted Q4 revenues of $37.5 billion. Earlier this year, Nvidia achieved a significant milestone by surpassing a $3 trillion market capitalization, setting a new benchmark in the tech industry. While Nvidia remains a major player in gaming and cryptocurrency, it is diversifying its focus. In July, the company announced plans to build infrastructure for advanced humanoid robotics, aiming to reduce its reliance on volatile sectors like crypto mining .

37536112,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392171,1733993387,What is Chain Abstraction? A Way to Simplify Blockchain,"The post What is Chain Abstraction? A Way to Simplify Blockchain appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Chain Abstraction is one of the rising crypto narratives as it simplifies on-chain interactions, heading towards mass blockchain adoption. Interacting with blockchain can feel complex and overwhelming for those new to crypto. Without Chain Abstraction, users have to manage their wallets manually, select the right blockchain, pay gas fees, and many more. The complexity involved can intimidate beginners, which is why Chain Abstraction was developed to simplify interactions and lower the barrier to web3 entry. This guide will show you what Chain Abstraction is, why it matters, and the benefits offered to new crypto users. Let’s dive in! 1. The Problem Towards Mass Adoption Web3 is fragmented beyond practical usability. Source: Particle Network One of the main reasons crypto can be intimidating for new users is the fragmented user experience. As new chains, layers, and rollups launch and grow, users’ accounts and liquidity are growing. This creates endless problems for users and a clunky user experience. Here are some main reasons Complex Onboarding Process: Many new users find blockchain interfaces too complicated to navigate. Fragmented User Experience: UX frictions remain a nagging problem for crypto users with hundreds of wallets, chains, and applications. Low Usage: Decentralized applications (dApp) developers often struggle to expand their user base due to complex blockchain interactions and the shortage of supported infrastructure. Capital Inefficiencies: Fragmentation has also brought along inefficiencies in Web3’s incentives and workings—some of them leading to the wastage of billions of dollars. Chain Abstraction addresses this challenge head-on, and brings Web3 closer to Web2’s experience. 2. What is Chain Abstraction? Chain Abstraction aims to abstract away the technical details of blockchain transactions, letting you use decentralized applications (dApps) without needing to understand the intricate workings of different networks. By hiding the technical details of each blockchain, Chain Abstraction allows users and developers to interact with dApps effortlessly. 3. How Does Chain Abstraction Work? In a multi-chain environment, the Permission, Solver, and Settlement layers work together to simplify and secure users’ experience. The CAKE framework for Chain Abstraction. Permission Layer When you connect your wallet to a dApp, you set an intent , like sending tokens to a wallet address or depositing funds to a smart contract on an Ethereum Layer 2 . Instead of worrying about how it works on each chain, the Permission Layer just needs to know what you have and handle permissions to make it happen. Solver Layer Next, the Solver Layer works on calculating the best route for your transaction. It finds the ideal balance of fees, speed, and success rate, even accounting for the hiccups that can occur with cross-chain actions. This way, you get the best value without manual tweaking. Settlement Layer Once you approve with your private key, the Settlement Layer completes your transaction by moving assets to the target chain and finalizing your intent. Some protocols even provide their own liquidity to streamline this step, so you don’t have to bridge assets manually. Together, these layers take the hassle out of multi-chain activity, letting you focus on what you want to achieve rather than the steps to get there. 4. Chain Abstraction’s Key Benefits Chain Abstraction offers many advantages for new users, whether in cross-chain activities, token transfer, or exploring new applications. Seamless Experience: Chain Abstraction simplifies interactions with ecosystem dApps. This makes it easier for new users to participate in activities like yield farming or staking without getting bogged down by complex procedures. Cost Savings: By automatically selecting the chain with the lowest transaction fees, or supporting any tokens for gas payment, Chain Abstraction helps users optimize gas costs. This is especially useful when users are trading volatile assets or transferring cross-chain. Interoperability: Chain Abstraction allows users to access various networks and dApps from a single, unified interface. You can easily engage with different DeFi platforms or NFT marketplaces without the hassle of managing multiple wallets. Better Development: For developers, Chain Abstraction means creating apps that work across chains without limitations. They can leverage the best features from any blockchain, reaching more users and enhancing the ecosystem. These benefits effectively enable users to engage more with the decentralized ecosystem, all while enhancing their overall experience in Web3. 5. Chain Abstraction in Action: Some Examples There are some prominent projects that are working on Chain Abstraction. The Chain Abstraction Market Map. Source: The Rollup 1. Particle Network Particle Network is one of the major players in the Chain Abstraction landscape. Built on the Cosmos SDK, this network’s Chain Abstraction spans both EVM and non-EVM networks, meaning users from almost any chain can interact seamlessly. Their core features make this interoperability possible: Universal Accounts: A single account and balance across chains, so users don’t need to juggle multiple wallets. Universal Liquidity: Cross-chain atomic swaps make it easy to interact with multiple chains without holding assets on each. Universal Gas: Users can pay gas fees with any token, simplifying cross-chain transactions even further. 2. NEAR Protocol NEAR Protocol takes a unique approach with multi-chain signatures, letting you use a single NEAR account to transact across NEAR, Ethereum, Avalanche, BNB Smart Chain, and Bitcoin Imagine using one account for all these chains—no more switching wallets or managing different accounts. NEAR’s cross-contract calls allow a smart contract on one chain to trigger an action on another. Chain signatures are verified across chains, making seamless interactions possible without switching back and forth. Embed Tweet: https://x.com/PinkBrains_io/status/1841040660067205381 3. Socket Another builder in Chain Abstraction is Socket. It can be seen as a Chain Abstraction marketplace, where various actors are incentivized to provide developers and users with the most seamless and cost-efficient experience. The Magic Account is one of the features built on Socket, offering the first look into chain abstraction. In detail, the Magic Account merges your balances across chains into a single account, so you can use your assets on any app, anywhere. Embed Tweet: https://x.com/litocoen/status/1833581746946036028 Final Words Although most projects in the area are still in the early phase, Chain Abstraction is set to change the way people interact with blockchain.

37537508,https://cryptonews.com/?p=318921,1733993188,Indian Economic Advisor Urges Regulators to Stay Away from Hindering Crypto Innovations,"India’s Chief Economic Advisor (CEA), Anantha Nageswaran, has urged regulators not to hinder innovations in the crypto and gaming sector. Speaking at the 2024 Global Economic Policy Forum on Wednesday, Nageswaran stressed the importance of regulatory transparency. He also advocated to strike a balance between fostering innovation and addressing social costs. “In a country with low per-capita income and financial illiteracy, not every innovation needs to be encouraged without any questioning. You have to have a social cost-benefit analysis of innovations such as Crypto and online gaming.” He also acknowledged the challenges posed by financial literacy in low-income nations and the need to evaluate emerging sectors. Further, Nageswaran stressed regulators to ensure their actions are guided by clear objectives. “Regulators must explain why a particular regulation is being introduced,” he said, adding that the proposal must contain information and goals it seeks to achieve. Such a transparent framework would foster accountability and trust, he added. Additionally, Nageswaran cautioned regulators to be accountable for “unelected power,” which means delegating power to independent government agencies. “Regulators need to be cautious of their unelected powers, they need to be accountable. Transparency needs to be there with information sharing by Regulators.” His call comes as India is battling with crypto regulations , including a 30% tax on crypto profits. However, several key crypto leaders in India hope to see a positive crypto policy framework. Early this year, Sumit Gupta, Co-Founder of one of India’s major crypto exchanges CoinDCX, told CryptoNews that “if considered positively, [cryptos] will provide a level playing field for domestic exchanges.” Nageswaran Calls Regulators to Distinguish Between Financial, Non-Financial Regulations According to a PTI report , Nageswaran emphasized the need to differentiate between financial and non-financial sector related regulations. This will mitigate the excessive risk and the competition instability. “We do need to make a distinction between regulation with respect to financial sector and regulation with respect to non-financial sector of the economy.” He added that in the non-financial sector, market forces or competition will take care of the regulator’s actions. However, in the financial sector, regulators tend to lean towards excessive regulations.

This move is part of the company’s broader efforts to strengthen its presence in Europe and meet emerging regulatory standards. The crypto exchange is actively seeking regulatory approval in 15 countries while already holding licenses in several EU nations . Recently, Bitget entered the UK market and is evaluating a return to the US market. Establishing a Lithuanian hub is expected to enhance its compliance efforts and solidify its standing in the region. To support this initiative, the company plans to recruit personnel for compliance and operational roles. Bitget’s Chief Legal Officer, Hon Ng, emphasized the company’s vision for Europe, stating, “Our vision goes beyond expanding business. Europe is at the forefront of the crypto revolution, and we are committed to contributing to its growing ecosystem of startups. By setting up a hub in the EU, we show our dedication to upholding security and compliance standards .” MiCA introduces a robust regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies across the EU, promising significant changes for the industry. Companies like Revolut X are capitalizing on these developments to expand their European operations, while others, such as Tether, are scaling back in anticipation of regulatory hurdles. If Bitget successfully navigates MiCA, it could gain a competitive advantage in the European market. However, challenges remain. In late November, Japanese regulators reprimanded Bitget for operating without proper registration. Such regulatory setbacks underline the importance of compliance and could hinder the company’s progress. The proposed regional hub in Lithuania is seen as a step toward mitigating such risks and demonstrating Bitget’s commitment to regulatory standards. Despite these challenges, Bitget’s momentum remains strong. The exchange’s native token, BGB, recently reached an all-time high, signaling continued growth and positive sentiment in the market. The press release indicates that Bitget is taking “proactive steps” to meet MiCA requirements, although no final decision on the Lithuanian hub has been confirmed.",POSITIVE,BGB,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SPONSORED | BGB,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/bitget-eyes-lithuania-for-eu-crypto-compliance,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37535917.jpeg

Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trumps-tariffs-trumptar-will-explode-over-16000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Cryptocurrency lending protocol Compound Fin a nce has introduced a bug bounty program offering rewards of up to $1 million, in partnership with Immunefi, to identify and address system vulnerabilities. In a Medium blog announcement on Thursday, Dec. 12, Immunefi said the bug bounty program is open to security researchers who can find issues in the protocol. The blockchain security firm noted that the size of the reward depends on the severity of the bug, with critical bugs can earn up to $1 million, while lower-level issues are rewarded with smaller amounts, starting at $1,000 “All rewards are denominated in USD but paid in COMP tokens, reinforcing Compound’s commitment to a secure and transparent defi ecosystem.” Immunefi You might also like: Immunefi and Ethereum Foundation launch “Attackathon” to enhance security for Ethereum Founded in 2017 by Robert Leshner and Geoffrey Hayes, Compound Finance is a decentralized finance protocol that allows users to borrow and lend cryptocurrencies.

Compound is deployed across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, and Arbitrum. In October 2023, a fork of Compound, called Onyx Protocol, was exploited due to a vulnerability in the code inherited from Compound. The attack exploited a known rounding error in the protocol’s design, which allowed attackers to drain $2.1 million from the system.

37537893,https://invezz.com/?p=2384380,1733992874,Australia fines Kraken operator $5.1 million in legal ruling,"In a landmark decision, Australia’s Federal Court has ordered Bit Trade, the Australian operator of the US-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, to pay a fine of 8 million Australian dollars ($5.1 million). The penalty follows a lawsuit by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) over regulatory breaches, including failure to comply with design and distribution obligations and offering credit facilities without proper licensing. Why was Bit Trade fined? The court’s decision stems from Kraken’s offering of a leveraged “margin extension” product without the legally required Target Market Determination (TMD). This product allowed users to trade cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies on leverage, a practice that the court found to be in breach of Australian corporate law. ASIC’s lawsuit highlighted that more than 1,100 Australians had used the product, incurring over $7 million in fees and interest and suffering losses exceeding $5 million. Notably, one individual investor reportedly lost almost $4 million. Justice John Nicholas, presiding over the case, emphasized the seriousness of the violations, which he attributed to a revenue-maximization strategy by Bit Trade. He criticized the company for continuing to offer the product to retail clients even after being made aware of the regulatory requirements. The court’s decision exceeded Bit Trade’s request to limit the fine to AU$4 million but fell short of the AU$20 million penalty sought by ASIC, which Justice Nicholas deemed excessive. ASIC Chair Joe Longo underscored the importance of TMDs in protecting consumers from potentially harmful financial products. He stated that the ruling serves as a “significant outcome” and a reminder for digital asset firms to prioritize compliance with regulatory standards. ASIC’s first penalty for failing to produce a TMD This case marks ASIC’s first penalty for failing to produce a TMD, signalling a new level of scrutiny for the cryptocurrency sector in Australia. ASIC Chair has noted that many products offered by crypto companies likely fall under existing laws and must be appropriately designed and marketed to safeguard consumers. A Kraken spokesperson expressed disappointment with the court’s decision while acknowledging the recognition of their compliance efforts. They argued that the case highlights the urgent need for bespoke cryptocurrency regulations to reduce uncertainty for businesses and investors. However, ASIC maintained that the lack of compliance demonstrated a disregard for local laws. The ruling comes as global regulators intensify oversight of the cryptocurrency industry, aiming to strike a balance between fostering innovation and ensuring consumer protection.

BlackRock and Fidelity were the leading buyers, both increasing their ETH balances to a new record. BlackRock and Fidelity became the top buyers of Ethereum (ETH) as demand for ETF investments increased. The two funds added $500M in new ETH inflows, shows on-chain data. ETH inflows increased in the past couple of weeks, surpassing the slower buildup of buying over the past months. Ethereum ETFs have seen almost constant netflows since November 21, with some neutral days, but no significant outflows. The past week saw record activity, drawing a total of $1.29B into the funds. Ethereum ETFs also experienced renewed exuberance after the US elections, which boosted both crypto and traditional markets. Ethereum ETF switched to inflows in November, surpassing the flows into Bitcoin funds. | Source: CoinAnk Demand for ETH rallied after the announcement of an altcoin season. Inflows also made a series of records, with a peak of $428.44M in daily inflows as of December 5. Since then, inflows have remained near their upper range, and have become more sustainable even on slower days. For traditional investors, ETH is still expected to outperform, especially with a prolonged bull market in 2025. ETH is seen as potentially underperforming, with investors attempting to benefit in case the asset starts to catch up rapidly. On-chain ETH holdings grow vertically The known wallets of BlackRock expanded to over 820K ETH held on-chain. The pace of inflows also accelerated in the past 10 days, resembling the initial hype after the ETF launch in the summer of 2024. The ETH inflows coincide with active Bitcoin (BTC) ETF buying, as the bull market hype drives investors into both assets. Fidelity also saw highly active ETH inflows within days, increasing its holdings to 114.63K ETH. The inflows arrived after months of negligible net growth, and coincide with the recent ETH breakout. ETH prices just under the $4,000 level coincide with renewed spot buying and ETF inflows. The BlackRock ETHA fund expanded to $3.55B in assets under management, while Fidelity grew to $1.56B. Grayscale remains the biggest ETH holder, despite restructuring in the past months. The Grayscale Ethereum Trust still holds $5.56B in ETH, while the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust holds $1.75B. Grayscale still controls most of the invested ETH, though growth may come from funds catching up to the current market leader. Grayscale also decreased its selling, leading to the more optimistic picture of new ETH inflows. Reasons for the renewed interest include a roll-over from BTC funds. Can ETH ETFs expand with staking? One unique feature of Ethereum holdings is they can be safely staked for passive income. ETFs have a requirement to keep their assets liquid and available for drawdowns, so most funds are only passively holding ETH. Some possibilities have been mentioned for creating an ETF that would also allow staking. Currently, ETFs hold relatively smaller amounts of ETH in comparison to validators and some liquid staking protocols. ETFs are more agile in raising funds, however, and can bring more ETH for staking . Due to the more conservative nature of the funds, their ETH holdings may never make it into the DeFi ecosystem. Various forms of liquid staking may pose counterparty risk for hacks and exploits, in addition to having longer withdrawal periods or deliberate delays. Demand for ETF shares does not reflect ETH sentiment from crypto insiders. The Ethereum chain remains controversial and still has multiple technicalities under discussion. Ethereum continues to serve as a base layer for its L2 ecosystem. While indispensable, the chain is also not producing net inflows, as most apps and L2 retain their earnings. At the same time, Ethereum has enough fee burns to move closer to a sound money asset. Ethereum inflation decreased to 0.12% , from a peak at 0.6%. As a result, only 3,569 new ETH is produced in a week, after months of adding more than 17K ETH to the supply. With more ETH locked in DeFi , staking or DEX liquidity, the token is also experiencing potential scarcity.

37535514,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392163,1733992346,"Scalability, Speed, and Smarts Combined: Has the Perfect Blockchain Finally Launched to Revolutionize the Market?","The post Scalability, Speed, and Smarts Combined: Has the Perfect Blockchain Finally Launched to Revolutionize the Market? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the ever-evolving world of blockchain technology, the pursuit of the “perfect blockchain” has been a constant endeavour. Scalability, transaction speed, and intelligent integration are key benchmarks by which platforms are measured, yet no single blockchain has fully delivered on all these fronts—until now. Rumours are swirling about a groundbreaking new platform that might check all the boxes and revolutionize the crypto market in 2024. Lightchain Protocol AI Presale Could this be the breakthrough the blockchain world has been waiting for? Let’s explore what this platform promises and why it has captured the industry’s attention. The Blockchain Trifecta: Scalability, Speed, and Smarts Current blockchain leaders like Ethereum, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain have made significant strides, but each faces challenges: Ethereum: High gas fees and reliance on Layer 2 solutions for scalability often deter users seeking cost-effective transactions. Solana: While boasting impressive transaction speeds, concerns about network stability and centralization persist. Binance Smart Chain: Efficient but criticized for prioritizing speed over decentralization, limiting its appeal to purists. These limitations leave room for a new blockchain to shine by addressing these core issues in an integrated, user-friendly manner. A New Contender: The Perfect Blockchain? While details about this new platform remain under wraps, early reports hint at a trifecta of capabilities designed to outclass its predecessors: 1. Scalability Without Sacrifice Scalability has long been the Achilles’ heel of many blockchains, but this project reportedly achieves it without compromising decentralization or security. Unlike Ethereum, which relies on Layer 2 scaling solutions, this blockchain is designed to handle high transaction volumes natively, making it suitable for both individual users and enterprise-scale applications. 2. Unmatched Transaction Speed Transaction speed is crucial for widespread adoption, particularly in industries like gaming, finance, and real-time analytics. This blockchain is rumored to deliver near-instant transactions, rivaling or surpassing Solana’s capabilities, while maintaining network stability and reliability. 3. AI-Driven Smarts What truly sets this platform apart is its seamless integration of artificial intelligence (AI). Through an advanced Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), the blockchain enables developers to create intelligent decentralized applications (dApps) capable of real-time decision-making, predictive analytics, and automation. Real-World Applications: Unlocking New Potential By combining scalability, speed, and intelligence, this blockchain opens the door to transformative applications across industries: DeFi Reinvented: Lightning-fast transactions and AI-powered analytics can optimize trading strategies and lending protocols, attracting both retail and institutional investors. Smart Supply Chains: Scalable and intelligent systems ensure transparency, traceability, and efficiency in global supply chains. Next-Gen Gaming: High-speed transactions and AI-driven experiences create immersive and interactive gaming ecosystems. Healthcare Innovation: Secure, decentralized data sharing combined with AI-powered diagnostics could revolutionize patient care and medical research. Why 2024 Is the Year to Watch The timing of this launch couldn’t be better. As the crypto market matures, demand for platforms that solve scalability and usability issues is growing rapidly. Additionally, with institutional investors and enterprises increasingly exploring blockchain solutions, a platform offering unmatched performance and utility could dominate the space. Key Indicators to Watch: Developer Adoption: A strong developer ecosystem is essential for creating dApps that drive adoption. Institutional Partnerships: Collaborations with established enterprises could provide the resources and credibility needed for rapid scaling. Community Engagement: Building an engaged community ensures long-term sustainability and decentralized governance. Can This Blockchain Revolutionize the Market? The blockchain industry has seen many “game-changers,” but few have delivered lasting impact. However, the combination of scalability, speed, and intelligent integration makes this platform uniquely positioned to redefine what’s possible. If it lives up to its promises, it could attract developers, businesses, and users from across the globe, becoming a cornerstone of the next generation of blockchain technology. The Future of Blockchain Innovation Scalability, speed, and smarts are the trifecta of blockchain innovation, and this new platform appears to have mastered them all. While it remains to be seen whether it can deliver on its ambitious promises, the potential for disruption is undeniable. As we move into 2024, this blockchain could lead the way into a new era of decentralized technology, leaving a lasting impact on the market.For more insights into the future of blockchain, check out the resources below: Website: https://lightchain.ai Whitepaper: https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Twitter/X: https://x.com/lightchainai Telegram: https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/smart-combined-blockchain-finally-launched-to-revolutionize-the-market/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart predict that the inclusion could happen this Friday, with the official listing on December 23. This move would mark a significant milestone for the company, which has become one of the top 100 publicly traded firms in the U.S. Currently, MicroStrategy is classified as a tech stock, allowing it to bypass Nasdaq’s restrictions on financial companies. However, this classification could be re-evaluated in March, posing a potential obstacle. Seyffart noted that while the company’s heavy investment in Bitcoin ties its performance to the cryptocurrency market, its status as a tech stock remains unchanged for now. Driven by consecutive Bitcoin purchases, MicroStrategy’s stock has soared by 500% this year. Despite its transformation into a major Bitcoin holder, Nasdaq still considers it a tech company. This distinction allows it to meet the criteria for inclusion in the index, provided there are no reclassification changes before the deadline. Balchunas suggested the addition of MicroStrategy to the Nasdaq 100 would reflect its rising prominence, particularly as a leader in corporate Bitcoin adoption. Seyffart agreed, highlighting that reclassification risks remain the main hurdle for the company’s potential inclusion. For now, the final decision rests with Nasdaq, and an announcement is expected by the end of this week. MicroStrategy’s inclusion would also spotlight Nasdaq’s evolving relationship with cryptocurrency. While the exchange has made limited entries into the crypto space, it facilitated BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF options earlier this year. The decision to add MicroStrategy could signal greater openness to crypto-related companies in the future. This potential move underscores how Bitcoin’s influence can reshape traditional market dynamics , positioning MicroStrategy as a key player in both the tech and crypto sectors. Whether the company secures its spot in the Nasdaq 100 will depend on upcoming decisions, but for now, it remains a strong contender for this significant milestone.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/microstrategy-poised-to-join-nasdaq-100-amid-bitcoin-surge,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37535478.jpeg

In a market filled with countless projects, separating the contenders from the pretenders can be tricky. Stellar and Monero have been grabbing attention recently for their innovative updates, catching the eyes of investors searching for the best altcoins to invest in now. But beyond the hype, there’s a new player bringing something fresh to the table— Qubetics ($TICS) . While Stellar and Monero each offer unique benefits, Qubetics sets itself apart with real-world applications like its decentralised VPN, not to mention a presale that’s already turning heads. Let’s dig into what makes these projects stand out, starting with why Qubetics is making waves in the crypto world. Why Qubetics Presale Is One of the Best Altcoins to Invest in Now If you’re looking for a cryptocurrency that isn’t just hype but has a solid use case, Qubetics might be your answer. Currently in its 12th presale stage , the $TICS token is available at $0.0311, with over $5.5 million raised and more than 305 million tokens sold to 8,400 holders. Each presale stage lasts seven days, ending every Sunday at midnight, with a 10% price increase at the close of every stage. This setup rewards early adopters while creating a sense of urgency. One of Qubetics’ standout features is its decentralised VPN , a tool built to offer privacy and security to individuals and businesses. Unlike traditional VPNs, which rely on centralised servers and can track user activity, Qubetics’ dVPN uses a peer-to-peer model to ensure total anonymity and freedom. Picture a journalist operating in a region with strict internet controls. Using Qubetics, they can access information freely without fear of surveillance. For businesses, the benefits are just as compelling. Whether it’s a healthcare provider protecting sensitive patient records or an e-commerce store safeguarding customer data, Qubetics’ decentralised VPN offers a robust shield against cyber threats. Now, let’s talk numbers. Analysts predict that $TICS could hit $0.25 by the end of the presale, translating to a 703.21% ROI. Projections don’t stop there—$TICS is forecasted to reach $1 after the presale, offering a 3,112.86% ROI, and could climb to $10 after the mainnet launch, a staggering 32,028.60% ROI. For example, an investment of $140,000 during this presale stage could potentially grow to $4.5 million if $TICS hits just $1.

The proposal, led by Mayor Ken Sim, includes creating a Bitcoin reserve and enabling BTC payments for taxes and city fees. It reflects a strategy to diversify financial reserves and protect against fiat currency volatility. A feasibility study on adopting Bitcoin will be completed by early 2025. Mayor Sim described the initiative as essential for financial stability and called it “irresponsible” not to consider Bitcoin’s potential. This marks a significant change from the city’s past anti-Bitcoin stance, including a 2019 attempt to ban Bitcoin ATMs under former Mayor Kennedy Stewart. Vancouver, which hosted the world’s first Bitcoin ATM, is now positioning itself as a Bitcoin-friendly city , signaling a major evolution in its approach to cryptocurrency. The approved motion aims to diversify the city’s portfolio and protect purchasing power amid concerns about fiat currency inflation. Proponents argue that Bitcoin could strengthen the financial resilience of the city’s assets while providing long-term benefits for taxpayers. Mayor Sim’s support for Bitcoin highlights his belief in its transformative potential, which he has described as “the greatest invention in human history.” The feasibility study will evaluate the risks, challenges, and benefits of adopting Bitcoin. The council's decision reflects growing global interest in cryptocurrencies, fueled in part by the reelection of pro-crypto leaders like Donald Trump, which has raised hopes for clearer regulations and wider adoption. If successful, this initiative could position Vancouver as a global leader in municipal crypto adoption. The city joins other forward-thinking municipalities experimenting with digital assets , aiming to modernize public finance. The feasibility report, expected in Q1 2025, will determine the next steps, considering potential challenges and the impact on taxpayers. Supporters of the initiative see it as a step toward future-proofing municipal finances, while critics urge caution until the study’s results are known. For now, Vancouver is at the forefront of exploring how Bitcoin can be integrated into public financial systems, setting a precedent for other cities. The move has attracted attention worldwide, with cryptocurrency advocates applauding the city’s progressiveness. As the discovery phase unfolds, all eyes will be on Vancouver to see if it can pave the way for municipal crypto adoption.

37535188,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392151,1733991733,Flockerz Presale Raises $5.6M as Traders Position For Next Meme Coin Season,"The post Flockerz Presale Raises $5.6M as Traders Position For Next Meme Coin Season appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto bull run is on pause this week after huge gains since November, but the new ICO Flockerz ($FLOCK) continues to grow. The project has now raised over $5.6 million in its token presale, with approximately $500K coming in the past three days. Market participants are using the cooling-off period as an opportunity to scoop up high-growth moonshots ahead of the next bull market rally. Flockerz is a new meme coin that emphasizes decentralisation. Through an innovative feature called “FlockTopia,” users can vote on decisions relating to the project’s future and even get paid for them. Traders are scrambling to buy $FLOCK as soon as possible because the price will rise throughout the ICO. The current price is $0.0063247 but the next increase will occur in under two days. A New Era For Meme Coin Governance Flockerz is setting the pace for meme coin governance, putting the community in complete control. The importance of this cannot be understated – there are thousands of examples of meme coin teams “pulling the rug” and hijacking thousands or millions of dollars from a project. One of the most high-profile cases is Pepe, with team members stealing $15 million from the project’s treasury in 2023. As you can imagine, this is a daily occurrence with smaller projects. That’s why the UK government just banned meme coin trading platform Pump.fun. This presents a big barrier for investors wanting to participate in the meme coin sector. And that’s why the Flockerz team emphasizes decentralization so much. Unlike most meme coins, Flockerz won’t be led by a centralized, self-appointed team. Instead, FlockTopia, a cohort of meme coin fans holding $FLOCK, will have the final say on every decision. The castle of flock awaits us! Let's go cast our vote! pic.twitter.com/1Dt55UcbHE — Flockerz (@FlockerzToken) December 4, 2024 But not only does every $FLOCK holder have a voice, they also get paid for participating in the FlockTopia DAO. While encouraging community participation, this also incentivizes users to vote in a way that best serves the project’s long-term success. Vote-to-Earn provides an increased feeling of ownership, with the community’s decisions directly impacting the value of their $FLOCK tokens. You’re Either Staking $FLOCK or Missing Out Flockerz holders can also generate income via the project’s staking mechanism, which is already live. Currently, staking provides a 470% APY, but this will decrease as the staking pool grows. 382,619,100 $FLOCK tokens have been staked so far, which shows a big commitment from the community. A whopping 25% of the token’s total supply is allocated to staking rewards, which is even more than the 20% allocated to the presale. $FLOCK holders who are not staking are missing out on some tasty gains. Meme Coin Season Loading, Analyst Says Flockerz Can 10x This year, the crypto market has been dominated by meme coins. The meme coin sector’s market cap has increased from $22 billion to $114 billion today. It peaked at $137 billion last week but has rectraced as the broader market catches its breath following a euphoric November. However, analysts believe it’s only a matter of time until the next breakout meme coin season, of which Flockerz is positioned for up to 10x gains. These are the thoughts of prominent meme coin trader ClayBro, which he revealed to his 133K YouTube subscribers recently: Buy $FLOCK Before The Next Price Increase There are less than two days until the next Flockerz price increase, so those seeking the most value for money should act fast. Investors can buy $FLOCK via the project’s presale website or using the Best Wallet app’s Upcoming Token feature. Best Wallet can be downloaded on the App Store and Google Play Store . In line with Flockerz’s commitment to security, the project has received smart contract audits from Coinsult and Solid Proof , both of which found the project to be safe and secure.

Quintenz currently holds the position of policy lead at a16z Crypto , the digital asset firm under venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz. Although, Quintenz himself and a spokesman for a16z refused to comment on the matter. Moreover, a spokesperson from Trump’s transition team also has not responded to Bloomberg’s request for comment. The transition team has reportedly finished interviewing potential candidates to lead the regulatory agency. The announcement that will reveal who is going to be the next CFTC Chairman is expected to come in the next couple of days. Under the Trump administration, the CFTC has been poised to have an even bigger role in regulating digital assets and other crypto-related products, such as Bitcoin spot ETF and Ethereum spot ETF. The agency will also supervise the options market, which has released several crypto products this year, As previously reported by crypto.news , the move is seen as Trump’s attempt to move more regulatory power to the CFTC from the Securities and Exchange Commission after its aggressive approach towards crypto during Biden’s term.

The European crypto investment firm highlights key trends in its latest report, including the influence of Donald Trump's potential presidency, the rise of Bitcoin-yielding companies, and advancements in Ethereum and Solana. The report predicts sweeping regulatory changes in the U.S. under a Trump administration . Analyst Max Shannon suggests that new policies supporting Bitcoin miners and digital assets could create a positive environment for the crypto industry. While Bitcoin is expected to perform well, altcoins might see even greater growth in this scenario. Miners focused solely on Bitcoin could outpace those diversifying into other sectors like AI or manufacturing. Bitcoin ETFs also show promise, with rapid growth and room for further institutional adoption. Currently, only 20% of Bitcoin ETF assets are held by professional firms, leaving space for expansion. A notable trend for 2025 is the emergence of Bitcoin-yielding companies. Businesses like MicroStrategy, which holds 423,650 BTC, are leading this shift by using Bitcoin as a treasury asset and creating innovative strategies for generating returns. Analyst Satish Patel highlights three methods of earning Bitcoin yields: growing Bitcoin reserves relative to shares, yield farming through Bitcoin lending, and leveraging derivatives for income. Companies like Block, Marathon Digital, and Metaplanet are following MicroStrategy’s lead. This trend shows a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s dual potential as a store of value and a revenue-generating asset . Additionally, major corporations such as Amazon, Shopify, and Nike are increasing their involvement with cryptocurrencies. Analysts suggest that these companies may incorporate Bitcoin into their treasuries as the crypto ecosystem expands. Ethereum's future also looks promising. The adoption of Layer 2 (L2) solutions is expected to rise, driven by institutionalization efforts and partnerships with companies like Kraken and Sony. Analyst Luke Nolan predicts increasing demand for Ethereum transaction fees as more users migrate to L2 chains. The upcoming Pectra upgrade in 2025 is expected to improve Ethereum’s efficiency while addressing usability and value accrual challenges . For Solana , infrastructure upgrades like Frankendancer and Firedancer aim to enhance scalability and performance by overhauling its networking and consensus layers. However, Solana must address its transaction-per-second limitations to achieve greater efficiency and maintain competitiveness.

According to a Dec. 11 statement , IcomTech founder David Carmona, along with four promoters of the scheme, namely Juan Arellano Parra, Moses Valdez, and David Brend, for violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulations. The court ordered them to jointly pay over $1 million in restitution to defrauded customers and imposed a $1 million civil monetary penalty on each of the four individuals. Additionally, Marco A. Ruiz Ochoa, who admitted to his role in the scheme, was issued a consent order requiring him to pay restitution jointly with the others, bringing the total penalties to over $5 million. Further, the accused also faces a permanent ban from registering with the CFTC and trading in any CFTC-regulated markets. IcomTech was touted as a Bitcoin mining and trading company that offered periodic returns of up to 100%. The scheme was active for a little over a year between 2018 and 2019 and managed to defraud hundreds of victims by promising daily returns between 0.9% and 2.8%. The scheme fell apart in 2019 when the company couldn’t keep up with withdrawal requests. Instead, they handed out a token called “Icoms” as a so-called solution, but it turned out to be practically worthless, leaving investors with even bigger losses.

Meanwhile, the funds were used to bankroll lavish lifestyles and host extravagant expos to lure more unsuspecting victims into their scheme. The CFTC initially filed a civil enforcement action in May 2023, leading to significant legal fallout, including jail sentences and penalties for those involved. Carmona and Brend have each been sentenced to 10 years in prison for their roles in the IcomTech Ponzi scheme, while Ochoa, who admitted his involvement, received a lighter sentence of 5 years. Together, Carmona and Ochoa have also forfeited over $1.2 million in illicitly obtained funds, with Carmona surrendering $329,450 and Ochoa forfeiting $914,000, the statement noted, adding that Brend was fined $40,000 as part of his sentencing.

Meanwhile, $PEPU is blazing ahead. Could it be that investors are selling Pepe tokens for Pepe Unchained, riding the Pepe the Frog hype wave while betting on $PEPU’s market-leading utility? Indeed, that’s what analyst Austin Hilton thinks. The high-profile trader urged his 350K YouTube subscribers to not miss the Pepe Unchained presale. However, Hilton has doubled down following its homerun DEX launch, saying the growth will only continue in the months ahead. Pepe Pump Pad To Launch Next – Let The Gains Begin Pepe Unchained’s meme coin launchpad, Pepe Pump Pad, is set to open to the public soon. Anyone will be able to launch a meme coin in two clicks and without coding, fast-tracking Pepe Unchained’s journey to become the leading blockchain for meme coins. It also comes with “Anti-rug protection.” By default, liquidity is locked so developers can not withdraw funds, ensuring every meme coin launched has a strong chance of success. Pepe Pump Pad is Pepe Unchained’s version of Pump.fun, the Solana-based meme coin generator that spawned some of the ecosystem’s most viral tokens, such as Goatseus Maximus, Peanut the Squirrel, and Moo Deng. Pump.fun has generated over $150 million in fees in the past six months, underlining the high demand for this type of platform. Now, Pepe Unchained is bringing it to the Ethereum ecosystem with lower fees and faster speeds. Claim and trade Pepe Unchained now Alongside the Pepe Unchained DEX launch, presale participants can now claim their tokens from the project’s website, or Best Wallet if purchased there. And for those who are yet to buy, this might be the best time to act. With the Pepe Chain set to launch soon, alongside Pepe Pump Pad and a slew of other market-shaking developments, there’s a strong possibility that this is the lowest price we’ll ever see $PEPU trading at.

With RLUSD, Ripple is positioning itself at the forefront of the rapidly expanding stablecoin market, projected to grow from over $200 billion to over $3 trillion within a few years. In the interview, Long highlighted the transformative potential of stablecoins in reshaping global payment systems. She noted that large players in the payments industry, such as Stripe, have already begun integrating stablecoin technology into their operations, evidenced by Stripe’s recent acquisition of Bridge. BIG BREAKING Monica Long: #RLUSD ’s $3 Trillion Market Use Case Will Boost Demand and Flow Seamlessly Through $XRP for Faster Transactions #XRPHolders #XRPArmy pic.twitter.com/LpjWsKSeat — Xaif | (@Xaif_03) December 11, 2024 These developments reflect a growing demand for efficient and scalable solutions in digital payments, a demand Ripple aims to meet with its USD-backed stablecoin, RLUSD. RLUSD – Ripple’s Answer to Payment Industry Demands RLUSD is an important part of Ripple’s strategy. It is a stablecoin designed to facilitate high-speed, low-cost transactions globally. RLUSD will address critical inefficiencies in traditional payment systems while meeting the demands of businesses and institutions increasingly turning to digital assets for payments. Ripple has already proven its capability in this space. Long revealed that the company has processed over $70 billion through its digital asset platforms. She emphasized that this expertise positions Ripple to become a leading provider of stablecoin solutions, with RLUSD poised to play a pivotal role in the $3 trillion market opportunity. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 RLUSD has been ready for some time, with Long noting in her interview that the asset was “operationally ready.” After an extended regulatory process, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) recently approved the stablecoin , and the company has plans to launch it soon. Long stressed the importance of regulatory oversight, viewing it as essential to fostering trust and adoption among institutional clients, and this approval is a major step for Ripple. Expanding Market Horizons Long dismissed the idea of competition with existing stablecoins. Instead, she expressed confidence in the market’s capacity to grow exponentially. Ripple views stablecoins as an evolving solution to meet increasing global demand for efficient payment methods and not as a competitive space. The company sees RLUSD as a complementary asset that will drive the stablecoin market forward rather than directly competing with incumbents. The $3 trillion potential market is fueled by industries seeking faster, more reliable cross-border payment solutions. By addressing these needs, RLUSD is expected to enhance the utility of the XRP Ledger. This will put a major spotlight on XRP while expanding Ripple’s role in the global financial ecosystem.

In a speech in the United Arab Emirates this week, the Bridgewater Associates founder pointed to debt levels in the US, China and all other major economies except for Germany, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reports . “It is impossible for these countries to be able to not have a debt crisis in the years ahead that will lead to a great decline of [money] value.” Dalio said that belief is leading him towards alternative investments. “I believe that there would likely be a pending debt money problem. I want to steer away from debt assets like bonds and debt, and have some hard money like gold and Bitcoin.” In his speech, the billionaire investor also outlined five factors that will drive his investment choices in the future, including 1) Debt, money and the economy; 2) Countries’ internal political orders; 3) External geopolitical order; 4) Acts of nature, like natural disasters; and 5) Disruptive technology. Explains Dalio, “Don’t get too caught up on the twists and turns of the day-to-day headlines, and instead, think more about the big forces.

Gox-Linked Wallet Transfer 2,300 Bitcoin, Is a Massive Sell-Off Looming? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin just regained the $100K mark, and defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox is back in the spotlight with over 2,300 BTC moving out of its wallet. This sudden transfer has sparked curiosity about the reasons behind these large transfers—are creditor repayments finally on the way, even with the deadline pushed back. Mt. Gox-Linked Wallet Transfer 2,300 BTC On December 12, a wallet associated with Mt. Gox moved 2,324 BTC, roughly worth $234 million, to an unidentified address. This move came after Bitcoin’s reclamins, the $100K mark, driven by optimism surrounding potential U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts . Interestingly, this transfer followed another significant move the previous day. On December 11, 2,623 BTC (worth approximately $255 million) was transferred from Mt. Gox-linked wallets to various addresses. These movements appear to be part of a series of large Bitcoin transfers made this month, including one on December 4, when the exchange sent $2.8 billion worth of Bitcoin to an unknown wallet. Possible Repayment to Creditors While the exact reason for these transfers remains unclear, historical trends suggest that they could signal the beginning of creditor repayments. Mt. Gox had previously announced in July that it was starting to repay creditors in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). The repayment process involves creditors verifying their accounts and registering with certain crypto exchanges like Bitstamp and Kraken to receive their funds. Deadline Extension Originally, repayments were expected to be completed by 31 October 2024. However, due to incomplete procedures and some technical issues, including a system error leading to “double deposits,” the repayment deadline was extended to October 31, 2025. Crypto Sell-off Could Happen? Mt. Gox’s history with large Bitcoin transactions has raised concerns about potential market disruptions. Some fear that the movement of these Bitcoin funds could lead to a significant sell-off. As of now, Bitcoin is trading near the $100K level, showing strong momentum with a market cap hitting $2 trillion. With the U.S. government expected to adopt a more pro-crypto stance in January 2025, Bitcoin may continue its bullish trend, potentially hitting new ATH soon.",NEUTRAL,BCH,BCH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/mt-gox-linked-wallet-transfer-2300-bitcoin-is-a-massive-sell-off-looming/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37533773,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392108,1733989096,4 Blockchain Projects Aligning With Bitcoin’s Ecosystem for Future Growth,"The post 4 Blockchain Projects Aligning With Bitcoin’s Ecosystem for Future Growth appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Unlike previous market cycles when Bitcoin’s dominance came at the expense of altcoins, a more symbiotic relationship is starting to emerge. More than anything, the growing correlation between BTC and the seemingly endless procession of alts reflects the broader landscape of interoperability and scaling solutions. At this juncture, multiple networks and tokens can happily thrive alongside Bitcoin rather than compete with it. Which is just as well, since Bitcoin – at least at present – has no competition. It is the blue-riband asset of the crypto world, the undisputed heavyweight champ. And its value has only been cemented by the growth of protocols and services built on its Proof-of-Work (PoW) network. Here are just a handful of examples. Lightning Network: Turbocharging Bitcoin’s Capabilities Launched in 2018 by Lightning Labs, the Lightning Network is a second-layer solution that has transformed Bitcoin’s utility by enabling near-instantaneous transactions at minimal cost. By implementing smart contract functionality for off-chain transfers, the decentralized network has theoretically enabled Bitcoin to process millions – or even billions – of transactions per second. Over the last six years, Lightning has become synonymous with bitcoin microtransactions and everyday payments, turning ‘digital gold’ from a dependable store of value to a viable medium of exchange. It’s also popular with hardcore bitcoiners, who appreciate that it upholds the chain’s core principles. In fact, as long as chains support the same cryptographic hash function, it’s possible to use Lightning to make transactions across networks without placing trust in a third-party custodian. EOS: Building Bridges to Bitcoin One of the original big beasts of the blockchain world, EOS has demonstrated admirable foresight in its approach to Bitcoin integration through exSat, a sophisticated ‘Docking Layer’ designed to enhance interoperability between Bitcoin and various Layer-2s. For evidence of the integration’s success, look no further than EOS’s steadily growing Total Value Locked (TVL) which has risen to a cool $259 million. Launched earlier this year, exSat extends Bitcoin’s consensus mechanisms, favoring a combination of Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake, all while maintaining its security and scalability. By letting users bridge BTC to EOS’ expanding DeFi playground, it has also opened fresh opportunities for investors to trade, swap, save, lend and borrow. Rootstock (RSK): Smart Contracts Meet Bitcoin As one of the earliest Bitcoin Layer-2s, Rootstock has established itself as a vital bridge between Bitcoin and the world of smart contracts. Its compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) makes it attractive to developers who can leverage existing Ethereum development tools and knowledge to build apps on Satoshi’s chain. Recent data from Messari underscores Rootstock’s growing adoption, with new accounts increasing by 111.9% quarter-over-quarter and active accounts growing by 61.0%. The total accounts now exceed 90,000, with users drawn in by a broad range of DeFi apps, DEXs, stablecoins, wallets, and bridges in the Rootstock ecosystem. Users appreciate the value of a platform combining Bitcoin’s security with smart contract functionality. ZeroSync If Bitcoin has an Achilles heel, it’s where privacy is concerned: all BTC transactions are public, traceable, and permanently stored in the network. Step forward ZeroSync , the world’s first zero-knowledge (ZK) light client for Bitcoin. With such a light client, it’s possible to run a full Bitcoin node on a smartphone. Privacy isn’t the only goal of ZeroSync; it also aims to level up Bitcoin’s scalability and accessibility, with its proof system capable of syncing with Bitcoin’s chain state instantly. The ultimate mission is to enable an ecosystem in which developers can apply Zero-Knowledge proofs to their own products and services. Recently, ZeroSync announced its involvement in the BitVM Alliance, a group dedicated to bridging BTC to second layers like sidechains, rollups and zkCoins. The Power of Bitcoin Alignment The success of the aforementioned projects reflects a crucial trend in blockchain development: alignment with Bitcoin’s ecosystem provides serious advantages, particularly in terms of sustainability and adoption. By building bridges to Bitcoin rather than trying to compete with it directly, these solutions have positioned themselves to benefit from its powerful network effects, security, and brand recognition. At the same time, they’ve set the scene for a DeFi-enabled Bitcoin wonderland.",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/4-blockchain-projects-aligning-with-bitcoins-ecosystem-for-future-growth/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37535005,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51945,1733988863,XRP Bots Are Back. Here’s What They Did,"The cryptocurrency market recently witnessed a sharp downturn which has many in the community speculating. XRP was affected by this, losing the $2 support level briefly. Among the discussions surrounding XRP’s performance, a recent post on X by Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode), a crypto expert, caught the community’s attention. Van Code highlighted a series of unusual trading patterns involving XRP/USDT, suggesting the involvement of automated bots. Van Code shared an image displaying repetitive XRP/USDT transactions of three XRP each, executed within milliseconds. These trades, numbering about 200, occurred shortly after a large order was processed. The #XRP bots are back at it, this string of 3 XRP orders executed when on for about 200 trades. These are not market makers, I think designed to pull price down, they happen every time after a large order is executed. pic.twitter.com/fvu3xZkc2x — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) December 10, 2024 He speculated that such activity might be designed to pull the price down, distinguishing it from standard market-making operations. While such patterns are not uncommon in cryptocurrency markets, they often raise questions about market manipulation and its impact on asset prices. The Market’s Recent Decline This unusual trading activity coincided with a broader market crash, which was covered in detail in a recent report by Times Tabloid . Experts attributed the crash to liquidations triggered by a significant sell-off on Coinbase. The cascading effect resulted in $2 billion in liquidations within 24 hours, marking the largest event of its kind since 2021. The market’s thin liquidity worsened the volatility, particularly for assets like XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The widespread decline was not limited to XRP. Bitcoin and Ethereum also saw sharp losses, with retail and institutional investors scrambling to cut their losses. XRP’s downturn is particularly noteworthy due to its unique challenges. The asset had gained significant momentum, reaching its highest level since 2018, the decline discouraged many investors who were hopeful for a continued resurgence. However, XRP showed resilience. Despite the bot activity shared by Vincent Van Code, its price is recovering, currently trading at $2.44, up 5% over the past 24 hours. The crash also cleared out speculative positions, providing a path for the market to recover. Ethereum showed similar resilience, bouncing back after a sharp decline. What’s Next for XRP? Despite the challenges highlighted by Van Code and the broader market analysis, XRP remains a vital player in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Its ability to weather regulatory storms and market volatility positions it as a top contender in the crypto space. Despite the recent crash, experts are bullish on the digital asset, with a former regulated fund manager recently describing it as one of the greatest opportunities for generational wealth . While questions about trading irregularities linger, XRP’s long-term potential remains intact. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Crypto King Musk (MUSKKING), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKKING is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Crypto King Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crypto King Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Crypto King Musk launched with over $7,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crypto King Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Crypto King Musk by entering its contract address – v2jWiNpR1m8gHARdM39GosZ8muaxZpowpBgWgWTSCev – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKKING. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/solana-memecoin-crypto-king-musk-muskking-to-rally-13000-ahead-of-first-exchange-listing-as-bonk-and-doge-drop/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

This rebound has been attributed to rising confidence in the digital currency sector’s future regulatory environment under President-elect Donald Trump. Bitcoin Price Nears Record Peaks The regulatory landscape is poised for significant changes, particularly with Brian Quintenz emerging as a strong candidate to lead the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Quintenz, currently the head of policy at a16z Crypto—Andreessen Horowitz’s digital asset division—and a former Republican CFTC commissioner, is seen as a favorable choice for the crypto community. Related Reading: XRP Price Defies Bearish Crypto Trend, Rallies 6%: Key Drivers Revealed This follows the recent selection of pro-crypto Paul Atkins to lead the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), giving him the ability to turn the regulatory agency 180 degrees after years of leading a regulation-by-enforcement crusade led by its retiring chair Gary Gensler. Trump’s recent efforts to reverse a Biden administration crackdown on crypto have contributed to Bitcoin’s recovery, which reached an all-time high of $104,00 on December 5. Since then, Bitcoin has fluctuated around the six-figure mark, indicating sustained interest from investors. Alongside regulatory optimism, expectations for a potential reduction in interest rates by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) have also bolstered investor sentiment. Bullish Sentiment Grows Following reports that US consumer-price inflation met forecasts, speculators have increased their bets on a new interest rate cut. This shift in monetary policy expectations has had a positive impact on markets, propelling the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 stock index to a record high. Henry Elder, a principal at UTXO Management, noted, “The market likes seeing inflation come in within expectations,” adding that traders are currently assessing whether $100,000 will act as a ceiling or a floor for BTC prices. Trump has not only indicated a willingness to foster a more favorable regulatory environment but has also supported the concept of a strategic national Bitcoin stockpile. While the feasibility of this idea remains debated, Eric Trump recently expressed on Bloomberg Television that his father would be “an unbelievable ally to the industry.” Related Reading: Solana Price At $4,000? Cup And Handle Pattern Shows Why This Is Possible Since Trump’s election victory on November 5, Bitcoin has surged nearly 50%, buoyed by approximately $11 billion in net inflows into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Technical expert Ali Martinez has added to the positive view for the flagship cryptocurrency by stating that whales are aggressively buying dips. Notably, 342 wallets with more than 100 BTC were created when prices dropped from $104,000 to $90,000. This accumulation by major holders fuels the positive mentality, with Martinez projecting the Bitcoin price will hit $275,000 based on a cup-and-handle formation on its one-week chart.

Bitcoin Holds Firm Above $100K Amid Symmetrical Triangle Breakout Bitcoin remains above the key psychological support of $100,000, consolidating after a symmetrical triangle breakout on the 2-hour chart. The breakout triggered a bullish push, but prices are now testing critical resistance levels. Immediate resistance is seen at $101,930, followed by $103,700 and $106,500. On the downside, support levels are observed at $99,750, $98,850 (aligned with the 50-day EMA), and $97,800. Technical indicators suggest a cautious outlook. The RSI stands at 59.20, indicating neutral-to-bullish momentum but showing potential signs of exhaustion. The 50-day EMA at $98,850 provides strong technical backing, reinforcing upward momentum as long as Bitcoin remains above this level. The symmetrical triangle breakout signifies potential for further gains if Bitcoin can decisively break $101,930 resistance. However, failure to hold above $99,750 could signal a retest of lower support levels. Key Insights: Resistance Levels: $101,930, $103,700, $106,500.

This represents a sharp recovery from a September 2024 low of 2.716 million ETH. “This consistent accumulation by ETFs is a sign of renewed institutional confidence in Ethereum,” the analyst noted, further underscoring the upward pressure on ETH’s price. Controlled Supply Growth Amid Deflationary Trends Ethereum’s total supply has reached 120.44 million ETH, its highest since April 2023. However, supply growth has decelerated recently, primarily due to an increase in ETH burned via network fees. Since September, deflationary forces have intensified as higher network usage has led to more ETH being removed from circulation. CryptoQuant reports, “The balance between controlled supply growth and rising demand sets the stage for potential price appreciation.” Ethereum’s network activity is another key driver of its bullish momentum. Total daily transactions in 2024 have consistently ranged between 6.5 and 7.5 million, compared to just 5 million in 2023. Similarly, the daily number of contract calls—an indicator of decentralized application (dApp) and smart contract usage—has also climbed to 6-7 million this year, up from a daily average of 5 million in 2023. This heightened activity has contributed to increased ETH burning, further tightening supply, reports CryptoQuant. Price Target: $5,000 and Beyond The factors listed above indicate that Ethereum is primed for a rally. The report highlights that ETH’s realized price, a valuation metric reflecting the average purchase price of ETH holdings, currently suggests an upper price limit of $5,200. If the current supply-demand trends and network activity persist, ETH could soon break above the $5,000 threshold. With institutional demand, controlled supply growth, and thriving network activity, Ethereum’s fundamentals are aligning for a potential breakout to new heights. Ethereum price is still down about 7.5% from last week’s highs of $4,100.

The Australian operator of the Kraken crypto exchange, Bit Trade, has been fined AUD 8 million (around $5.2 million) for unlawfully issuing a credit facility to more than 1,100 customers, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission said in a Thursday press release , Dec. 12. The Federal Court ruled that the company failed to follow Australian laws requiring financial products to have a target market determination to ensure they are sold to the right customers. From October 2021, Bit Trade offered a margin extension product that “provided for margin extensions to be made and repaid in either digital assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) or national currencies such as U.S. dollars,” the regulator says. However, the product was marketed without a required target market determination, a key regulatory document meant to ensure financial products are offered only to suitable customers. You might also like: Kraken unveils broker offering in Australia for institutions The court found Bit Trade’s product breached design and distribution obligations requirements every time it was issued without a target market determination. Customers were charged fees and interest exceeding $7 million, with trading losses surpassing $5 million, the regulator claims. One investor reportedly lost nearly $4 million using the margin extension product. Justice Nicholas, in his ruling, described Bit Trade’s actions as “serious and motivated by a desire to maximize revenue,” adding that the company failed to address compliance requirements until flagged by ASIC. Commenting on the ruling, ASIC Chair Joe Longo called it a “significant outcome,” adding that “it is ASIC’s first penalty against an entity for failing to have a TMD and a reminder for digital assets firms to consider their regulatory compliance obligations.” In addition to the fine, Bit Trade was ordered to cover ASIC’s legal costs.

While some might dismiss these quirky coins as mere jokes, the right picks can deliver jaw-dropping returns, especially in the short term. Today, we’re diving into three of the best meme coins to buy and hold for the short term: BTFD Coin, Mog Coin, and Neiro. Leading the pack, BTFD Coin has smashed through the $3.4 million meme coin presale mark, selling over 50 billion coins and attracting more than 4,400 Bulls to its growing community. Mog Coin’s massive $1.5 billion market cap has firmly planted it in the meme coin hall of fame, while Neiro continues to soar, cementing its status as the spiritual heir to Doge. Whether you’re looking for short-term gains or want to ride the meme wave, these coins deserve your attention. BTFD Coin: $3.4M Raised, Beta Game Launch, and a Bright Future If FOMO had a mascot, it would be BTFD Coin. Short for Buy the Dip, this cheeky yet ambitious coin is taking the crypto world by storm. With its presale tally crossing $3.4 million and over 50 billion coins already sold, the project is gathering serious momentum. Here’s the big news: BTFD Coin’s Beta game is now live! It’s your first chance to dive into the Bulls’ universe—a vibrant, gamified ecosystem featuring the beloved Bulls Squad (Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull). While the Beta version doesn’t offer rewards just yet, it’s the perfect way to explore what’s coming in the full Play-to-Earn release. But let’s break down the numbers for today, shall we? At its current presale price of $0.00012, a $1000 investment in BTFD Coin would get you 8,333,333 tokens. If the coin hits its projected post-launch price of $0.0006, your investment could skyrocket to $5,000—a 5x return. That’s the kind of dip-buying action we can get behind! Unlike many meme coins, BTFD Coin offers more than just hype. Its roadmap includes staking with an average APY of 90% , a full-scale game release, and a robust community-driven approach. With its playful branding and solid utility, BTFD Coin is positioning itself as a meme coin with staying power. Mog Coin: A $1.5B Market Cap and Meme King Status It feels like Mog Coin is the undisputed heavyweight champion of the meme coin world right now. Boasting a jaw-dropping $1.5 billion market cap, Mog Coin has transcended meme status to become a major player in the crypto space. The meme coin even overtook Popcat’s market cap, which means it’s set to grow even further. In other words, it’s your chance to get your hands on a bunch of Mog tokens before they skyrocket. Mog Coin has captured the imagination of internet culture. Its rapid ascent is fueled by a mix of meme-based marketing, celebrity endorsements, and a dedicated fanbase. But it’s not all hype—Mog Coin has a robust liquidity pool, ensuring stability in a notoriously volatile market. Analysts suggest that Mog Coin’s recent partnerships with prominent NFT artists and upcoming plans to integrate utility within Web3 platforms could provide even more short-term investment opportunities. While its explosive growth might slow down, there’s still plenty of room for gains, especially for those who jump in early. Neiro: A Moonlit Launch and Community-Driven Revival Last but not least, we have Neiro, the Doge-like underdog with a backstory straight out of a feel-good movie. Launched on Ethereum during the August 2024 New Moon, Neiro has quickly risen to fame thanks to its community-driven ethos and a sprinkle of Vitalik Buterin magic. Shortly after Neiro’s launch, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin donated over $500,000 to an animal welfare fund in honour of the project. This marked only the second time Vitalik had publicly interacted with a meme coin, adding an undeniable layer of credibility to Neiro’s mission. Today, Neiro stands as a testament to resilience, with plans for charitable donations, Ethereum-first innovation, and long-term growth. Its live price is $0.05682, showing potential for growth by early 2025 (analysts forecast an impressive 222.27% rise by January). Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out In a world where memes fuel million-dollar market caps, the opportunities for short-term gains are endless. BTFD Coin, with its $3.4 million presale tally and Beta game launch, offers an exciting entry point for investors ready to buy the dip. Mog Coin continues to dominate with its $1.5 billion market cap, while Neiro proves that even the underdog can shine. Ready to dive in? Don’t let these opportunities pass you by—join the BTFD Coin presale today and explore the Bulls world while it’s still early. Short-term gains are just a dip away!

According to data from SoSoValue, the majority of inflows on Dec. 11 went into Fidelity’s FBTC, which saw $121.9 million in new investments, extending its inflow streak to ten days. ARK and 21Shares’ ARKB fund and Grayscale’s GBTC also contributed significantly, with inflows of $52.67 million and $20.13 million, respectively. Additionally, Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust, Biwise’s BITB, and VanEck’s HODL funds received more modest inflows of $15.74 million, $12.16 million, and $2.87 million, respectively. However, Valkyrie’s BRRR fund was the only outlier, reporting outflows of $2.44 million on the day.

As of the report, total net inflows into the 12 BTC ETFs amounted to $34.58 billion. These inflows coincided with Bitcoin’s recent rally, which saw the crypto asset surpass $100,000, reaching a high of approximately $102,000. This increase came as recent U.S. inflation data raised expectations of a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve .

37537503,https://cryptonews.com/?p=318878,1733987620,Senate Delays Vote on SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw’s Re-Nomination,"A Senate committee vote on the re-nomination of Democratic Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been postponed. Originally scheduled for December 11 as part of a U.S. Senate Banking Committee hearing, the vote was delayed just minutes before it was due to begin, according to a report from Bloomberg . Senate Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown called for the delay, but his request to reschedule the vote for later in the day was blocked by Republican Senators. Brown later criticized what he described as a “disgusting smear campaign” against Crenshaw, attributing it to corporate special interests. No New Date Yet Set for Crenshaw’s Renomination No new date has been set for Crenshaw;s renomination. The delay opens the door for the potential creation of a three-person Republican-led SEC once Donald Trump assumes office next year. It also raises the possibility that President-elect Trump could nominate Republican Paul Atkins to replace Crenshaw. On December 4, Trump nominated Atkins for SEC Chair, with pundits predicting that Congress may confirm his appointment between March and April 2025, depending on the progress of other nominees. In a recent appearance on the Unchained Crypto podcast, Cody Carbone, President of The Digital Chamber, suggested that Trump might further consolidate his influence over the agency by nominating an independent commissioner, potentially shifting the SEC’s composition to a 4-1 Republican majority. Currently, the SEC is composed of two Republicans—Hester “Crypto Mom” Peirce and Mark Uyeda—and three Democrats, including Crenshaw, Gary Gensler, and Jaime Lizarraga. If Crenshaw is re-nominated, she would remain the only Democrat on the SEC’s commission. In November, SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced that he would step down on January 20, 2025. Additionally, Commissioner Jaime Lizarraga is set to depart on January 17 to care for his wife, who is battling breast cancer. These departures could shift the SEC’s dynamics further, depending on how nominations are handled in the coming months. Crypto Community Criticizes Crenshaw Crenshaw’s tenure at the SEC has been met with criticism, particularly from the crypto industry. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, in a December 9 post on X, described her as a “failure of an SEC Commissioner.” He criticized her opposition to Bitcoin ETFs, claiming she was even more detrimental to the crypto space than Gensler. Caroline Crenshaw was a failure as an SEC Commissioner and should be voted out. She tried to block the Bitcoin ETFs, and was worse than Gensler on some issues (which I didn't think was possible). The Senate Banking Committee should take note – the crypto community is watching… https://t.co/JQyp2zYaY2 — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) December 9, 2024 Cody Carbone also expressed concerns about Crenshaw’s stance on crypto in a December 11 letter to Brown and Republican Senator Tim Scott. Carbone argued that Crenshaw’s dissent on spot Bitcoin ETPs was based on outdated data and failed to recognize improvements in market structure and oversight. As Cryptonews reported earlier , President-elect Donald Trump is considering selecting Paul Atkins as SEC Chair. Atkins, who previously served under SEC chairs Richard Breeden and Arthur Levitt, is “crypto savvy” and has a “deep understanding of the inner workings of the agency.” Trump, who most recently launched his family’s crypto platform, World Liberty Financial, has regularly vowed to enact a crypto-friendly regulatory framework upon returning to the Oval Office. As of late, the SEC has been facing growing criticism due to its “regulation-by-enforcement” approach to the crypto industry.

Combining cutting-edge artificial intelligence with degen culture, iDEGEN has captivated traders and investors alike. With a dynamic pricing model that fosters volatility and an innovative approach to community engagement, this token has become a standout contender in the crypto landscape. A dynamic pricing model designed for traders iDEGEN’s presale employs a unique dynamic pricing mechanism that creates a fast-paced and exciting trading environment. Prices are adjusted every five minutes based on market activity, offering three potential scenarios. If at least one purchase occurs within a five-minute interval, the price remains steady for the next cycle. Consecutive purchases across two intervals trigger a 5% price increase, rewarding consistent demand. Conversely, inactivity during an interval results in a 5% price drop, providing opportunities for bargain hunters. This dynamic approach appeals to traders seeking volatility and quick gains, driving significant interest in the presale. Since its launch on November 26, 2024, iDEGEN has raised over $4.2 million and sold more than 943 million tokens, demonstrating strong market enthusiasm. The presale will conclude on January 1, 2025, and the token’s listing price will be 10% higher than the final presale value, adding further incentive for early adopters. AI-powered community engagement Besides the dynamic presale pricing model, the other thing that sets iDEGEN apart is its integration of artificial intelligence (AI) to foster community engagement and adapt its development. Dubbed the “fatherless AI” born from a mix of a degen’s sock and an Nvidia chip, iDEGEN embraces a humorous yet innovative identity. Its AI actively learns and evolves by absorbing data from tweets directed at it. This interaction-driven model enables iDEGEN to respond to every tweet and post hourly updates without moderation or training guardrails. This highly interactive approach has cemented iDEGEN’s place as a community-centric project. By leveraging X (formerly Twitter), iDEGEN ensures its development aligns with user feedback and the ever-changing dynamics of the crypto space. The slogan “AI Born. Degen Raised.” encapsulates its ethos, combining technological innovation with the chaotic spirit of crypto degen culture. As the presale nears its end, all eyes are on its listing in January 2025, where its value is expected to climb even higher. For investors seeking a mix of cutting-edge technology and high-risk, high-reward opportunities, iDEGEN offers a compelling proposition.

37537502,https://cryptonews.com/?p=318877,1733987371,ASIC Imposes $8M Fine on Kraken Crypto Exchange Over Regulatory Breach,"Crypto exchange Kraken’s Australian arm is facing an AU$8 million (US$5.1 million) fine from the country’s corporate watchdog. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has imposed a hefty fine on Kraken for “unlawfully” offering a credit facility to over 1000 Australians. Kraken, which operated under Bit Trade in Australia, had issued a ‘margin extension’ product to its customers since October 2021. However, the exchange offered the product without a target market determination (TMD), the regulator noted. “Target market determinations are fundamental in ensuring that investors are not inappropriately marketed products that could harm them,” ASIC Chair Joe Longo said. Kraken apparently charged customers over US$7 million for issuing its margin extension product, without considering whether the product was appropriate. “Those customers Bit Trade targeted suffered trading losses of more than US$5 million, including one investor who lost almost US$4 million.” This marks the ASIC’s first penalty against an entity for failing to have a TMD. Further, the watchdog has warned crypto asset service providers to consider their regulatory compliance obligations. The penalty comes 4-months after the Federal Court found that Bit Trade’s product was a credit facility without a TMD. In August, the court deemed that the company breached its design and distribution obligations each time it offered the product. Kraken Criticizes Aussie Regulator In September, the crypto exchange platform raised concerns against the regulator over unclear crypto regulations in Australia. It accused the ASIC of having a “confusing and uncertain regulatory environment.” The exchange further noted that the Federal Court’s decision in August “underscores the broader issue of regulatory ambiguity.” “This ruling makes it clearer than ever that bespoke crypto regulation is urgently needed.” ASIC’s Industry Consultation with Crypto Sector Last week, the ASIC invited feedback on its proposed updates on crypto guidance. This includes decreasing the focus on the role of initial coin offerings and considering the design and distribution obligations. The aim is to offer greater clarity to the existing law, the ASIC release said. “We want to promote the growth of responsible financial innovation while ensuring consumer protection,” ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland noted. “A well-regulated financial system benefits everyone in the community as it supports consumer confidence, market integrity and facilitates competition and innovation.” Meanwhile, the ASIC has taken action against various financial service providers for violating design and distribution obligations. For instance, multi-asset broker eToro faced a similar action from the regulator for lapses in its contracts for differences.

37537501,https://cryptonews.com/?p=318879,1733987264,A16z Crypto Lead Brian Quintenz in Talks for CFTC Chair Role,"Brian Quintenz is a leading contender to head the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), potentially driving a major shift in crypto regulation under President-elect Donald Trump. Bloomberg reported on Thursday that Quintenz has been interviewed for the role. Brian Quintenz leads the Policy division for a16z Crypto, part of Andreessen Horowitz. Previously, he served as a Commissioner at the CFTC. President Obama initially nominated him, and President Trump later re-nominated him. The US Senate unanimously confirmed his appointment in Aug. 2017. His tenure concluded in Sept. 2021. Brian Quintenz’ Background in Crypto, Prediction Markets At the CFTC, Quintenz pushed for lighter regulation in cryptocurrency and DeFi. He led the Technology Advisory Committee, promoting in-depth policy discussions on crypto. He also played a key role in the launch of the first US-regulated Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts. Since joining a16z, Quintenz has actively advocated for more welcoming regulatory policies for both industries. Additionally, he joined the board of Kalshi, which stands as one of the first CFTC-regulated prediction markets. Trump Eyes CFTC as Key Crypto Regulator, Announcement on Chair Looms Many in the digital asset industry view the CFTC as the ideal regulator for crypto exchanges in the US. Consequently, Trump reportedly aims to expand the CFTC’s authority by granting it oversight of the digital asset market, while simultaneously planning to curb the SEC’s influence over this sector.

In just 24 hours, the total market cap has skyrocketed by 5.35%, reaching a massive $3.64 trillion, as Bitcoin surges back above the $100K mark. Not only that, but trading volume has also jumped 35%, hitting $225 billion, signaling strong momentum for December. Altcoins aren’t left behind either, with Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin all experiencing impressive gains of 5% to 9%. CPI Report Boast BTC To $100K Bitcoin, the leader of the market, has bounced back above $100,100, reflecting a rise of 3%. A key factor behind Bitcoin’s rise is the release of the U.S. November Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which showed a 2.7% increase, just as expected. This data suggests that inflation is under control, which has led to growing speculation that the Federal Reserve may soon cut interest rates. A rate cut would make riskier investments, like cryptocurrencies, more attractive, further driving demand for Bitcoin. Bitcoin ETFs record $439.5m inflows In addition to positive economic data, institutional interest in Bitcoin is growing. On December 11, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States marked their 10th consecutive day of inflows, with total net inflows surpassing $34 billion. According to Lookonchain data, these 10 Bitcoin ETFs attracted $538.45 million in inflows, with BlackRock leading the charge at $302.89 million, followed by Fidelity, Galaxy, and Grayscale.

The round is led by HSG (HongShan Capital Group) and Peak XV Partners. A number of high-profile angels, partners of DST Global, and Goodwater Capital also joined the round. “For most countries and over half of global GDP, banking does not match the openness and speed of the Internet, it’s fundamentally broken. Stablecoins are the clear solution, but the user experience wasn’t great. We are building KAST to change this”, adds Raagulan Pathy, KAST’s Co-Founder. Pathy is a stablecoin expert, formerly the VP for Asia Pacific & CEO for Singapore at Circle, best known for USDC. KAST offers payment cards and USD-denominated accounts to people in over 150 countries, the ability to receive and send cash, and working with partners such as Bridge (recently acquired by Stripe). KAST will soon launch savings and other remittance products — all without the need to touch fiat directly. The maturing of stablecoin regulation and acceptance has led to rapid integration with traditional finance networks, enabling users to send money faster, cheaper, and more securely.

Drake called out Cardano’s security model, claiming it puts users’ assets at risk. Hoskinson said that Cardano is built on Bitcoin’s decentralized model. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of the Cardano blockchain, criticized Ethereum researchers for failing to study the project’s advancements over the last seven years. His comments came after Ethereum researcher Justin Drake discussed Cardano’s security in an interview on the Paul Barron Network, a crypto-focused podcast . Drake claimed that Cardano’s consensus mechanism, Ouroboros, poses risks because it lacks penalties like slashing, where validators lose part of their staked cryptocurrency for malicious behavior. According to Drake, this allows attackers to act without consequences. Hoskinson refuted these claims in a post on X (formerly Twitter), stating that Ouroboros provides strong security without relying on slashing.

37533008,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51940,1733986370,XRPL Validator Explains Synergy Between XRP and RLUSD on the XRPL,"Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, and XRP, the native cryptocurrency of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), share a unique relationship as they work in tandem to enhance liquidity and trading efficiency across the decentralized network. While both assets are pivotal within the XRPL ecosystem, their unique characteristics and complementary roles make them critical components for fostering seamless transactions. Vet (@Vet_X0), a validator on the XRPL, recently weighed in on this, sharing crucial insight into the roles of both assets. Key Differences Between XRP and RLUSD The most notable distinction between XRP and RLUSD is in their nature. Vet pointed out that XRP is a neutral, decentralized digital asset with no counterparty risk. This neutrality positions XRP as a bridge asset, enabling efficient cross-border value transfers and reducing counterparty concerns for market participants. Conversely, RLUSD, as a Ripple-issued stablecoin, has Ripple as its counterparty. Stablecoins like RLUSD are pegged to fiat currencies—in this case, the U.S. dollar—providing price stability and is a reliable medium of exchange within the ecosystem. While RLUSD depends on Ripple’s backing and trust, XRP remains an independent asset with intrinsic liquidity benefits. Complementary Functions on the XRPL XRP and RLUSD complement each other by addressing distinct needs within the XRPL ecosystem. XRP’s neutrality and liquidity enable it to act as a bridge asset for transactions involving RLUSD and other tokens. This is particularly advantageous for market makers, as XRP minimizes counterparty risk and can streamline liquidity across diverse assets. According to Vet, “XRP will always be preferred by market makers” for most trading pairs due to its counterparty-free nature. However, direct stablecoin-to-stablecoin trades, such as RLUSD to RLCAD, will remain an option. Vet noted that the XRPL’s advanced algorithm automatically determines the optimal path for conversions, whether it involves direct offers or routing through XRP for better rates. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Long-Tail Assets and XRP XRP’s utility as a bridge asset becomes particularly pronounced for the “long tail” of assets with less liquidity or newly issued tokens. Market dynamics suggest that such assets often lack direct trading pairs with sufficient liquidity. In these cases, XRP can provide a cost-effective intermediary step, improving accessibility and reducing slippage for traders. RLUSD could play a transformative role in the ecosystem, and the community is excited about its launch now that it has been approved . Vet noted that the stablecoin would help Ripple merge its payment system with the XRPL. While some highly liquid trading pairs may bypass XRP entirely, the broader thesis is that XRP’s role as a neutral, liquid asset will ensure its relevance in most conversion scenarios. This capability makes XRP indispensable for maintaining efficiency across the XRPL. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

37533184,184239,1733986305,KAST Secures US$10 Million Seed Round Led By HSG (HongShan Capital Group) and Peak XV Partners,"Cayman Islands, George Town, December 12th, 2024, Chainwire KAST , a financial technology platform built on stablecoins to deliver a neobank-style experience, has raised US$10 million in seed funding. The round is led by HSG (HongShan Capital Group) and Peak XV Partners. A number of high-profile angels, partners of DST Global, and Goodwater Capital also joined the round. “For most countries and over half of global GDP, banking does not match the openness and speed of the Internet, it’s fundamentally broken. Stablecoins are the clear solution, but the user experience wasn’t great. We are building KAST to change this”, adds Raagulan Pathy, KAST’s Co-Founder. Pathy is a stablecoin expert, formerly the VP for Asia Pacific & CEO for Singapore at Circle, best known for USDC. KAST offers payment cards and USD-denominated accounts to people in over 150 countries, the ability to receive and send cash, and working with partners such as Bridge (recently acquired by Stripe). KAST will soon launch savings and other remittance products — all without the need to touch fiat directly. The maturing of stablecoin regulation and acceptance has led to rapid integration with traditional finance networks, enabling users to send money faster, cheaper, and more securely. KAST highlighted use cases such as holding USD stablecoins as an alternative to volatile currencies, enabling people to buy imports and travel with a card, and allowing remote workers globally to get paid. “The next generation of neobanks will be built on stablecoins and inherently global by DNA. They will differ fundamentally from the current generation of neobanks, which are limited in countries due to licensing, and struggle in integrating blockchain; their core systems and capabilities are just too different,” comments Daniel Bertoli, co-founder of KAST and former Partner at Quona Capital, a global FinTech fund that focuses on investments in neobanks. KAST has completed a $10 million seed funding round at an undisclosed valuation. Within its first four months, the company has demonstrated strong early traction in terms of user adoption and revenue. The team views this as a reflection of significant global interest in its platform. Stablecoins have experienced remarkable growth with over US$170 billion in supply, and US$8.5 trillion transaction volume in Q2 2024 by over 125 million users. Analysts predict by 2030; user numbers will exceed 1 billion and supply will surpass US$1 trillion. “KAST delivers real benefits to global users. Their USD-denominated accounts provide a safe haven for hard-earned income when local currencies decline, especially for those without access to traditional US accounts. As more digital nomads receive salaries in stablecoins, they can now bypass the hassle of legacy rails. International transfers that once took weeks can now be completed instantly and at virtually no cost,” said Alex Svanevik (CEO/co-founder of Nansen.ai, an early investor in KAST). Users can visit the KAST website to learn more about KAST and discover how their innovative offerings can transform financial experience.

37532207,https://crypto.news/?p=14318634,1733986248,4 reasons behind Aave’s rally to 40-month highs,"Aave recorded significant gains, emerging as the top gainer among the leading 100 crypto assets, amid the market-wide bullish momentum. Aave ( AAVE ) surged 34% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $355 at the time of writing. The native token of the leading lending protocol saw its market cap rise to $5.3 billion, making it the 31st-largest cryptocurrency. Source: crypto.news This is the first time since late August 2021 that Aave has broken the $350 mark. 4 main reasons behind Aave’s rally First, the broader crypto market, including Bitcoin ( BTC ), started rising right after Wednesday’s U.S. Consumer Price Index report. The U.S. inflation rate in November came at the expected 2.7% year-over-year, 0.1% up from October’s 2.6%, according to data from Investing.com. You might also like: Bitcoin price to hit $275,000, top crypto expert predicts Subsequently, Bitcoin crossed the $100,000 mark again as the global crypto market capitalization increased by 4%, reaching $3.82 trillion, per data from CoinGecko. Second, a set of new developments brought bullish sentiment to the second-largest decentralized finance protocol — Aave’s DeFi total value locked is hovering at $22 billion. Balancer announced to upgrade its decentralized exchange and automated portfolio management protocol to v3 in partnership with Aave, crypto.news reported on Wednesday. The lending protocol will optimize Balancer v3’s liquidity pools, allowing users to maximize yield. Moreover, Aave is set to launch on Linea, a zk-rollup network supported by Consensys, after getting the green light from its community. This will allow Aave to scale up and increase its transaction throughput with lower fees. Third, President-elect Donald Trump’s DeFi project, World Liberty Financial, accumulated $1 million worth of AAVE tokens at an average price of $297.8 earlier today. Last but not least, Aave’s whale accumulation strengthened as the price fell below the $260 mark on Monday. According to data from IntoTheBlock, the asset’s large holder net inflow reached 103,610 AAVE on Dec. 9.

37532108,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374383,1733986129,"Here’s What BTC, DOGE, XRP Whales Did During The Market Correction","TL:DR; The entire cryptocurrency market experienced sharp declines in the past few days before prices recovered, with BTC jumping above $100,000 once again. On-chain data shows that whales holding some of the biggest and most popular crypto assets used this opportunity to stack up. BTC Whales Buying Recall the price events that transpired since the start of the week. Bitcoin tried its hand at taking down $100,000 on a couple of occasions during the weekend, but each was met with a severe correction that pushed it south hard. In fact, the largest cryptocurrency dumped by over six grand twice and slipped to $94,400 on Monday and Tuesday, where it actually found the necessary support. It bounced off yesterday in a quite impressive fashion, gaining almost eight grand in less than a day from its aforementioned bottom to $102,000 (local peak on Bitstamp). These violent price swings liquidated over 500,000 over-leveraged traders at one point and they usually tend to push the so-called ‘weak hands’ out of the market. However, those with stronger convictions, usually larger investors, use these corrections to accumulate more of the asset. This was the BTC case, according to on-chain data shared by popular analyst Ali, who noted that 342 big wallets (containing at least 100 bitcoins) were created during this retracement. #Bitcoin whales are buying every dip! In fact, 342 wallets with over 100 $BTC were created as prices dropped from $104,000 to $90,000. pic.twitter.com/cMJRnshOAt — Ali (@ali_charts) December 11, 2024 Lookonchain said that even when BTC spiked above $100,000 once again, whales continued to accumulate, with a single one buying 201 BTC at such high prices. XRP and DOGE, Too But it’s not just bitcoin. It seems wealthy investors are highly bullish on other cryptocurrencies as well, such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP). Further data shows that whales bought over 100 million XRP during the asset’s crash, from over $2.4 to under $2. It was one of the poorest performers at one point during the market-wide corrections, but it managed to erase all losses and is back above $2.4 as of now.

Marking an end to speculations, yesterday, Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple Labs, confirmed that the company received approval from the NYDFS to launch RLUSD. Notably, crypto expert Vincent Van Code opines that Ripple’s stablecoin stands out over competitors such as USDT and USDC. Here is what you should know. What Makes RLUSD Special? Primarily, Ripple’s stablecoin now has the approval of the NYDFS, which is very important as it ensures high trustworthiness. US banks can hold #RLUSD on the XRPL/ETH ledger, and why USDC and USDT cannot. Here's an explanation of why RLUSD is so special and why it took years to get approved… READ ON Regulations Summary: U.S. GAAP/IFRS: Assets must have clear value, reliable measurement, and meet… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) December 11, 2024 Additionally, Van Code points out that the stablecoin is fully compliant with four important US financial regulations: US GAAP, Basel III, FDIC and Federal Reserve Rules and the Dodd-Frank Act. The expert states that RLUSD is backed entirely by onshore US assets like Treasury bonds, ensuring its compliance with US GAAP and Basel III. He adds that the stablecoin operates under real-time audits. RLUSD’s compliance with the US GAAP ensures that the stablecoin has clear value and passes impairment testing. GAAP is a set of accounting rules used in financial reporting in the US. The compliance with Basel III indicates that the stablecoin meets liquidity and risk-weighting standards. Basel III is a set of procedures designed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The procedures, which mainly target improving the risk management of banks, were originally developed in response to the 2007 US financial crisis. Van Code also notes that the assets of the stablecoin are held in regulated financial institutions, ensuring its compliance with FDIC and Federal Reserve directives. The stablecoin’s compliance with FDIC and Federal Reserve rules means that RLUSD secures assets under regulated custody. Finally, the compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act suggests that the stablecoin enhances transparency with oversight for financial instruments. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is legislation passed by the US Congress in response to the 2007 financial crisis. The core principle of the act is that markets should be transparent. Why USDT and USDC Fall Short Pointing to USDT’s lackluster approach towards the requirement of regular audits, Van Code alleges the stablecoin has failed to comply with the basic audit requirements. Emphasising the inability of the stablecoin to meet the US GAAP and Basel III standards, the expert also claims that the reserves of the stablecoin include high-risk or illiquid assets. The expert thinks that USDC is much better than USDT in terms of transparency. However, he strongly denounces its ability to compete with RLUSD for being partly offshore, mentioning that offshore operations make full compliance with US regulations impossible. In conclusion, RLUSD has set a new benchmark for stablecoins by meeting stringent US regulatory standards. As the first stablecoin US banks can hold, RLUSD paves way for a more secure and transparent stablecoin future.",POSITIVE,USDT | XRP | USDC,FIAT | REGULATION | USDT | XRP | USDC,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-news-now-why-ripples-rlusd-outshines-usdt-and-usdc/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

The motion, introduced by Mayor Ken Sim, was discussed and passed during a council meeting on Tuesday , marking a significant step toward integrating cryptocurrency into the city’s financial ecosystem. The proposal includes assessing the feasibility of accepting taxes and fees in Bitcoin and converting a portion of Vancouver’s financial reserves into the digital asset. Bitcoin Could Help Address Inflation Concerns According to the motion, holding Bitcoin could help safeguard the city’s purchasing power against the volatility, inflation, and debasement of traditional currencies. “Diversifying the City of Vancouver’s financial reserves and payment options to include Bitcoin would not only enhance the resilience of our City’s financial portfolio, it would ultimately benefit the city’s taxpayers,” the motion said. City staff have been tasked with evaluating the potential risks and benefits of this bitcoin strategy and are expected to present their findings by the end of the first quarter of 2025. Mayor Sim, a vocal advocate for cryptocurrency, has described Bitcoin as “the greatest invention in human history” during an interview with the Coin Stories podcast. The council’s decision aligns with broader pro-crypto sentiment, bolstered by the recent re-election of U.S. President Donald Trump, whose stance is expected to favor crypto-friendly regulations. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price surged 4.44% in the past 24 hours, reaching $100,791. #VanCityCouncil approves motion 3. Preserving of the City’s Purchasing Power Through Diversification of Financial Reserves – Becoming A Bitcoin Friendly City. — Vancouver City Clerk (@VanCityClerk) December 11, 2024 Sim first announced plans to diversify the city’s financial resources by adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet last month. At the time, he submitted a notice of motion to explore the possibility of Bitcoin becoming a reserve asset for the city. To advance this vision, Sim has requested a comprehensive report by the end of Q1 2025 to evaluate the feasibility and implications of adopting Bitcoin. The study will assess potential risks, benefits, and practical aspects such as asset management, storage, and liquidation strategies. It will also include consultations with stakeholders to build a robust framework for Bitcoin adoption. MicroStrategy Acquires More Bitcoin On Monday, MicroStrategy revealed that it has made another significant move in its Bitcoin accumulation strategy, purchasing 21,550 BTC for approximately $2.1 billion. The acquisition, conducted between December 2 and December 8, was executed at an average price of $98,783 per Bitcoin. With this latest purchase, the business intelligence giant now holds a total of 423,650 BTC, valued at around $42 billion. The latest acquisition marks the firm’s fifth consecutive week of Bitcoin investments. Just last week, MicroStrategy acquired 15,400 BTC for $1.5 billion at an average price of $95,976 per coin. In a related development, the National Center for Public Policy Research, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank advocating for free-market principles, has called on Amazon to consider adopting a Bitcoin-focused corporate treasury strategy.

Meanwhile, outgoing Senator Sherrod Brown warned about crypto's risks during his final Senate speech, while Senator Elizabeth Warren prepares to take on a critical Democratic leadership role. Alabama State Auditor Andrew Sorrell recently advocated for a state Bitcoin reserve to boost financial stability and attract more innovation, despite the slow legislative progress on crypto adoption in the state. World Liberty Financial Increases Ethereum Holdings World Liberty Financial, a crypto project that is backed by President-elect Donald Trump, recently bought $5 million in Ethereum (ETH). This raised its total ETH holdings to over $50 million. The purchase was made through a wallet linked to an Aave fork, which executed three transactions to receive 1,285 ETH from CoW Swap, a decentralized exchange. Currently, ETH is trading around $3,830. ETH price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The wallet seems to be using profits from the ongoing WLFI token sale to buy the ETH by converting stablecoin holdings. This strategy could indicate that World Liberty Financial is planning to engage more deeply with the crypto economy, and considers ETH as a better reserve asset than the U.S. dollar. Ethereum investor Eric Conner commented that the Trump family is actively converting stablecoins into ETH rather than holding them. World Liberty's terms state that the Trump family’s limited liability company will receive 75% of the WLFI token sale proceeds and manage the treasury as it sees fit. According to Arkham Research, the World Liberty wallet holds almost $73 million in cryptocurrencies, including over $50 million in ETH, $10 million in wrapped bitcoin, and various stablecoins. Since its inception, World Liberty conducted 146 swaps on CoW Swap. The Dec. 11 transaction was one of its largest in recent weeks. The project also purchased around 2,000 ETH nine days ago and nearly 3,000 ETH 12 days ago. Since its launch on Oct. 15, the project has sold more than $55 million in WLFI tokens. Although this is a pretty impressive number, it still falls short of its $300 million fundraising goal. The token sale accepts ETH, USDC, and USDT, but is limited to accredited investors in the U.S. with specific income or net worth requirements. Trump shifted away from being a Bitcoin skeptic to a supporter of the crypto industry. He has also made promises to enhance the crypto landscape, including appointing a “Crypto Czar” and advocating for the World Liberty platform to position America as the crypto capital of the world. Sherrod Brown Exits Senate With Warnings on Crypto and AI Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown delivered a parting message to U.S. lawmakers in the Senate Banking Committee as he prepares to leave office in January. In his prepared remarks for a Dec. 11 hearing, Brown warned against the influence of corporate interests under the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. The Ohio senator accused Trump of allowing corporate entities to exploit workers and customers. He also warned about the potential weakening of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and urged lawmakers to safeguard the institution. Brown specifically mentioned some emerging risks like algorithmic pricing, artificial intelligence, and cryptocurrency as threats to the financial stability of working Americans, and even accused these sectors of enriching corporate elites at the expense of ordinary citizens. Senator Sherrod Brown Brown’s departure was announced after his loss to Republican Bernie Moreno in the recent Senate race, a contest that was influenced by large financial contributions from crypto-backed political action committees. These PACs actually spent more than $40 million on ads. The outcome helped shift Senate control to Republicans. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is set to become the ranking Democrat on the Banking Committee. Both Brown and Warren have been very critical of the crypto industry, and consistently expressed skepticism toward its impact on financial regulation and consumer protection. Meanwhile, the Senate Banking Committee recently postponed a vote on SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw’s renomination. Crypto advocacy groups lobbied against Crenshaw by arguing that her potential continuation until 2029 could hinder industry growth. With SEC Chair Gary Gensler stepping down in January, Crenshaw will remain one of only two Democratic commissioners at the regulatory body, alongside Jaime Lizárraga. Democrats Finalize Leadership Roles As the 119th United States Congress approaches, Democratic lawmakers have finalized their ranking members for key committees in preparation for their shift to minority status. California Representative Maxine Waters will remain the ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee through 2025. This committee oversees legislation impacting the financial services sector, including cryptocurrency. Republican Patrick McHenry, the current chair, will leave office on Jan. 3. In the Senate, Republicans are set to take control of the Banking Committee as Democrats lose their majority. As mentioned above, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will serve as the ranking member after her reelection victory over Republican John Deaton. The committee oversees the SEC and other crypto-relevant regulators. South Carolina Senator Tim Scott , a pro-crypto advocate, is expected to take over as chair. Senator Elizabeth Warren Changes are also anticipated in the Senate Agriculture Committee, which oversees the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). With Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow retiring, Amy Klobuchar may step into the ranking member role, while Republican John Boozman is poised to become chair. The CFTC could gain some expanded authority over digital assets if the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act is enacted in the next Congress. This could potentially increase its influence relative to the SEC. Alabama Auditor Pushes for State Bitcoin Reserve Alabama State Auditor Andrew Sorrell recently advocated for establishing a state Bitcoin reserve due to the benefits of cryptocurrency for attracting business and enhancing financial stability. In an interview with 1819 News, Sorrell stated that early adoption of crypto-friendly tax and regulatory frameworks will position Alabama as a leader in attracting investment and innovation. He also argued that Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) now make it easier for states to invest in digital assets and they provide a better value proposition compared to traditional investments like bonds. Sorrell proposed that Alabama's Bitcoin reserve be modeled on the Federal BTC reserve suggested by President-elect Donald Trump. He recommended accumulating Bitcoin through monthly purchases over two years, and wants to take advantage of its resilience against inflation and the potential risks of relying heavily on the U.S. dollar as the global reserve currency. Despite Sorrell’s enthusiasm, Alabama’s progress on crypto adoption has been rather slow. The state passed legislation in May to establish the Alabama Blockchain Study Commission, which is tasked with examining issues like crypto regulation, taxation, and mining. The commission is set to report its findings to the Legislature by 2026. However, a bipartisan bill aimed at protecting digital asset storage, mining, and node operations from restrictive regulations and additional taxation failed to pass this year. On the federal level, Alabama is represented by pro-crypto Senator Tommy Tuberville, who is still active in advancing crypto-related legislation.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6501/world-liberty-financial-converts-stablecoins-to-buy-5-m-in-ethereum,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Pepe Loves Santa (PEPESAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Loves Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Loves Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Loves Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Loves Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Loves Santa by entering its contract address – 9FuN9o4pQgF3NF1v2saWvb7b9hNKDJ1DGU6LSbur437Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/pepe-loves-santa-pepesan-solana-memecoin-will-explode-19000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

More recently, BTC absolutely melted up from $68,000 at the start of November to a record high above the $100,000 level in about 30 days. But the brief pull-back may have only been the little orange coin taking a breath for its next sprint up the chart. While Bitcoin has massively outperformed stocks and bonds in 2024, it has also markedly outpaced price gains in spot gold markets. Legendary technical market analyst and futures trader Peter Brandt noted on Tuesday that a key BTC metric just flashed a promising bullish sign. Legendary Chart Analyst Notes Bullish BTC Metric , The Bitcoin/Gold $BT /$GC_F ratio has stumbled at a crucial level, with heavy resistance at 36-37 to 1 range pic.twitter.com/GZeYaGMTuf — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 11, 2024 While BTC’s price stutter-stepped into the inflection zone around the key trend line using the Bitcoin-to-Gold ratio, a decisive push past resistance here is more validation for long-term crypto bulls’ expectations of a prolonged bull run for the asset through 2025. Following a record-setting week for Bitcoin ETF inflows, the Wall Street crowd has never been more pumped for Bitcoin. Moreoever, BTC prices recovered handily Wednesday with a 24-hour candle above +5.5%, according to CoinMarketCap data. As a result, the market appears poised to cross the four-year Bitcoin-to-Gold resistance line, signaling a potentially massively bullish trend shift to even more bullish than the past 12 months. BTC’s Price Continues to Beat Schiff’s Favorite Asset Gold is up another $32 today, trading just below $2,700 per ounce. More significantly, it’s at a new record-high priced in Australian dollars. A lot of #gold mines operate in Australia. With their local labor costs falling relative to gold, profits should be considerably higher. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 10, 2024 Markets might expect BTC’s price increase in dollars because the Fed is always printing more. But the surge against gold is truly impressive, which is why this chart from a recent post to the Bitcoin subreddit is not exactly correct. Planet Earth has a scarce gold supply and there is no publicly-known method to create the metal that wouldn’t cost far more money than the gold’s market value, using nuclear fusion. So, Bitcoin’s market appreciation against spot gold valuations shows that its growth is about more than just dollar inflation. Euro Pacific Capital founder and chief strategist Peter Schiff is a vocal critic of Bitcoin and says gold is better.

The important support area to watch is between $0.83 and $1.06. There are two potential pathways for ADA from here. Pathway 1: Price Continues Higher In this scenario, ADA could continue rising directly in a five-wave move to complete wave five of the larger third wave. This move might push ADA to levels around $1.42, potentially even $1.72 before a larger correction begins in wave four. Afterward, a rally in wave five could occur. Pathway 2: Larger Fourth Wave Unfolding The second possibility is that ADA is already in the larger fourth wave. In this case, the price is forming an ABC structure as part of wave four. Both pathways are plausible, but the first option, with one more push higher, seems to be the preferred outlook. Key Support Level to Watch The key support level to watch is $0.64, which is a 50% retracement of the rally that began in November. If ADA drops to this level, it would mean a more significant pullback before the next move up. The price could also move higher in the short term before this support is tested. Short-Term Movements and Market Influence In the short term, ADA may show some fluctuations, as it is closely tied to Bitcoin’s performance. Bitcoin dominance is currently decreasing, allowing altcoins like ADA to recover. However, ADA’s next resistance zone is between $1.15 and $1.27. This area could cause some resistance, as it aligns with previous price levels and volume profiles. Resistance and Future Targets If ADA faces rejection at the $1.15 to $1.27 area, a possible decline in a five-wave structure could lead to a C-wave down. In that case, ADA might find support around $0.76.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/cardano-price-prediction-today-ada-bulls-target-1-72/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Speaking about Uphold’s innovative approach, Beaton highlighted the use of RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin, as a prime example of the exchange’s commitment to flexibility and user convenience. In a video shared on X by blockchain researcher and crypto enthusiast Collin Brown (@CollinBrownXRP), Beaton described Uphold’s “anything to anything” trading model, which allows users to directly exchange a wide range of assets without being restricted by conventional pairings. She pointed out that RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin, can be easily swapped for Bitcoin, gold, or other financial instruments. This model aims to streamline the trading experience, offering users greater autonomy over their transactions. Seamless Trading Across the Market Uphold’s unique pairing system is part of a broader strategy to enhance transaction efficiency and bridge traditional financial tools with digital assets. By simplifying the trading process, Uphold has positioned itself as a leader in improving the accessibility of cryptocurrency markets for both experienced traders and newcomers. The launch of RLUSD aligns with Uphold’s goal of expanding asset choices while catering to users seeking stability amid volatility in the cryptocurrency market. The stablecoin has been a focal point for many crypto traders as it recently received final approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Uphold’s support of this stablecoin reflects its broader mission of fostering interconnected financial systems and advancing the role of blockchain technology in traditional markets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Potential Benefits for XRP As part of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) ecosystem, RLUSD could play a critical role in boosting XRP utility. XRP is the primary bridge asset for transactions on the XRPL, facilitating rapid and cost-effective exchanges between different assets. The synergy between RLUSD and XRP adoption is expected to have far-reaching implications. With RLUSD’s integration, XRP’s usage for fees, liquidity, and network operations is expected to grow, further solidifying its position in the broader blockchain space. In his post, Brown stated, “With XRP as the auto-bridge asset, the future is looking GOLDEN!” With RLUSD’s launch approaching, its potential impact on the cryptocurrency landscape is becoming increasingly apparent. Uphold executives have previously shown support for RLUSD and its role in global finance, and this forward-thinking approach positions the exchange as a key driver of innovation within the industry, paving the way for a more inclusive and efficient financial ecosystem.

The project made huge moves in the crypto world by buying millions of dollars worth of Ethereum, Chainlink and AAVE. These purchases not only got the ecosystem interested but also helped the prices to soar. Let’s dive into the details to see what they are doing. Ethereum’s Big Day WLFI spent a whopping $10 million in USD Coin (USDC) to buy 2,631 Ether (ETH). At the time, Ether was priced at an average of $3,801 per token. This massive purchase caused the price to have a sudden spike of 2.36%. By the end of the day, ETH had already jumped by 6.86%. This gives a clear idea of how just one big transaction can send ripples throughout the market. Source : Arkham Intelligence But that wasn’t all. WLFI’s move boosted investor confidence, proving how much influence this DeFi project has on the crypto scene. Chainlink and AAVE Get Their Moment It wasn’t just Ethereum feeling the love. WLFI dropped another $1 million USDC to snag 41,335 Chainlink (LINK) tokens at $24.2 each. This caused LINK’s price to shoot up by 20.56%, reaching $26.72 in just 24 hours. That’s a serious surge, even for a volatile market. AAVE didn’t miss out either. WLFI spent $1 million on 3,357 AAVE tokens at $297 each. While the market impact wasn’t as dramatic as with LINK, it still cemented WLFI’s role as a heavy hitter in the DeFi space. Justin Sun’s Big Bet Adding to the excitement, Justin Sun, founder of Tron, announced a $30 million investment in WLFI . This makes him the project’s largest investor. He’s also taken on an advisory role, bringing his years of blockchain experience to the table. Exciting Announcement!

This uptick followed a tough Wednesday, where leveraged traders incurred losses amounting to $1.5b due to a bearish beginning of the week. Crypto Market Gains Momentum Amid Hopes for Lower Interest Rates The market’s surge followed positive US CPI data that signaled expectations for a less aggressive monetary policy, boosting the appeal of risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. Wednesday’s data showed that the CPI rose by 0.3% last month, the highest increase since April, following four months of 0.2% gains.

Lower interest rates cut borrowing costs, boost market liquidity, and encourage investors to move funds into higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies. As a result, investors may shift funds from safe-haven assets like bonds to the volatile cryptocurrency market, seeking higher returns. Crypto Market Turns Around as Bitcoin Finds Support, Analysts Predict Growth Aave , Sui and Chainlink led the gains among cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, Bitcoin and Ether increased by 3.5% and 6.8%, respectively. It marks a turnaround for the market as Bitcoin is recovering after dropping below $96,000 earlier this week due to investors cashing in profits at peak prices, which increased selling pressure and drove prices down. Buyers regained control when Bitcoin’s price fell below $95K, leading to a recovery, said Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro’s chief market analyst. “The meaningful round level has prompted long-term private holders to sell. At the same time, there is a growing appetite for corporations to buy on their balance sheets. Then, there is the key to how governments holding impressive amounts of confiscated Bitcoins will behave,” he said. Kuptsikevich further noted that Bitcoin is currently facing psychological resistance, reminiscent of 2020, when it was reluctant to surpass $20K at year-end but ultimately broke through, shortly doubling in price thereafter. “In this cycle, we see upside potential to $120-140K in the next couple of months before the next major shakeout,” the analyst said. Altcoins Show Rally Potential According to Avinash Shekhar, co-founder and CEO at Pi42, Bitcoin’s rebound points to bullish trends in the market. “Optimism is that BTC might target $112,000 and could go up another level to hit $125,000. Resistance at $104,088 could keep volatility in check in the shorter term as market can see consolidations,” Shekhar said. “Ethereum and XRP will also look at further upward moves, as ETH targets $4,500 if a key breakout is above $4,000 and XRP on rebound support at above $2.30 puts the aim at $3.50. Meanwhile, Dogecoin climbing from oversold territory shows renewed demand and improves optimism in the market. This could indicate a wider rally among altcoins and keep the bullish sentiment alive in the crypto market as investors wait for clearer signs of the macroeconomic stability.” The post Crypto Market Gains 4% in 24 Hours as Bitcoin Holds Firm Above $100K appeared first on Cryptonews .",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-market-gains-4-pct-bitcoin-holds-firm-above-100k/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37537495.jpeg

World Liberty Financial is a unified platform where users can borrow and lend cryptocurrencies, create liquidity pools and transact with stablecoins. WLFI serves as a governance token for the platform.  President-elect Donald Trump is ""chief crypto advocate"" of the project. Two of his sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr., are ""web3 ambassadors,"" while Barron holds the title of ""DeFi visionary.""  Data shows the project purchased $10 million in ether (ETH), and $1 million each in aave (AAVE) and Chainlink’s LINK tokens early Thursday. ETH prices surged 7% in Asian morning hours after the purchases, while AAVE and LINK prices surged 30% on the bullish sentiment.  The wallet has additionally spent $30 million to buy 8,105 ETH at an average price of $3,700 in the past 12 days, per Spot on Chain.  Well-followed crypto trader @TheFlowHorse speculated that the tokens were likely part of bigger plans in the coming months: “Trump’s account is buying the crypto pairs that are set to benefit heavily from his plans.”  World Liberty Financial uses data provider Chainlink's services for better integrating with the wider crypto ecosystem. Chainlink supports the platform by providing crucial pricing data and cross-chain interoperability infrastructure, per a November report.  “With Trump’s World Liberty Financial DeFi platform adopting the Chainlink standard for data and cross-chain connectivity earlier this year, the recent onchain purchase of $1M in LINK only further strengthens the long-term alignment between the two ecosystems,"" Chainlink community liasion Zach Rynes said in a Telegram message to CoinDesk.   ""As the new administration brings regulatory clarity for crypto in the US, Chainlink and WLFi are well positioned to scale DeFi to the masses in a way never seen before,"" Rynes added.  Last week, the platform’s DAO proposed deploying a World Liberty Financial Aave v3 instance. This instance will be managed through external risk managers, built on the existing Aave v3 infrastructure, and released on Ethereum.  An instance refers to a specific deployment or version of a protocol, application, or service on a blockchain network.

After juggling below the levels for a couple of days, the token raised, squashing the bearish possibility This shook up the entire market, while positive rounds around the popular tokens like ETH, LINK, & AAVE attracted double-digit gains. As per the reports, the company owned by the new president-elect Donald Trump, World Liberty Financial, swapped over $5 million USDC for Ethereum, Chainlink, & Aave. With this, the ETH holdings reached $55 million, and LINK & AAVE reached above $1 million each. Soon after this, the prices of LINK & AAVE triggered a massive upswing, attracting over 15% gains; meanwhile, the ETH price continues with its consolidated gains. The LINK price has attained levels not seen since January 2022, suggesting a strong influx of bullish volume onto the token. Donald Trump’s win had triggered the markets and the round of LINK accumulation is expected to elevate the LINK price rally towards new highs. The LINK price rally has surpassed the crucial resistance zone between $27.32 and $28.26 with huge backing from the bulls. While the weekly RSI surged above the upper threshold, the MACD shows the rise in the buying volume. Moreover, the token underwent a bullish ‘Golden Cross’ that may offer more momentum. The next level to watch is around $34.39, which may clear the path to $40 if the zone between $37 & $37.5 is cleared. The current trade set-up suggests the Chainlink price has just entered a bullish range and a bullish yearly close above $40 could trigger a massive bullish wave towards a 3-digit figure. On the other hand, AAVE, in which Trump’s company holds over $1 million, also demonstrated a similar rise, suggesting a huge confidence of traders over the token. The AAVE price is about to reach the neckline of the parabolic recovery curve that could further push the price towards the final resistance zone between $516 and $566. With this, the weekly RSI has surpassed the upward threshold for the first time since inception. Moreover, the token may experience the very first weekly Golden Cross that could push the price beyond the current ATH at $668. Once these levels are reached, then the AAVE price is expected to surge and reach the milestone at $1000 during the upcoming Altseason.",POSITIVE,AAVE | ETH | LINK,AAVE | ETH | LINK | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/chainlink-link-aave-aave-explode-as-trumps-firm-buys-1m-worth-of-tokens-each-a-new-ath-at-100-1000-is-loading/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Analyst Cites Cup And Handle Formation","Bitcoin (BTC) fell to $94,500 yesterday after Microsoft shareholders decisively rejected a Bitcoin treasury proposal to allocate 1% of the company’s total assets to buy BTC as an inflation hedge. However, analysts are still confident of further appreciation of the BTC price. Bitcoin May Surge As High As $275,000 According to data from Coinglass, over $478 million worth of contracts – primarily long positions – were liquidated in the past 24 hours following the plunge in BTC and other cryptocurrencies. Interestingly, liquidation volumes were higher in altcoins compared to Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Resets Open Interest, Targets $100,000 After Holding Key Support – Details However, some analysts view this price dip as a buying opportunity. Seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez took to X to highlight a long cup and handle pattern forming on Bitcoin’s weekly chart. For those unfamiliar, the cup and handle pattern is a bullish technical formation that resembles a rounded “cup” followed by a brief consolidation period or “handle.” It typically signals the potential for a continuation of an uptrend, often leading to significant price gains. Martinez noted that the pattern suggests Bitcoin could surge as high as $275,000, based on its technical structure. However, he also urged traders to exercise caution and avoid overleveraging their positions. On the other hand, prominent crypto analyst @Trader_XO warned that Bitcoin must maintain its support at $90,000 to avoid further downside. Should BTC lose this critical level, it could drop as low as $85,000. Conversely, holding above $90,000 would allow the cryptocurrency to rebound and resume its uptrend. BTC Takes Another Jab At Breaking Through $100,000 Despite yesterday’s dip, Bitcoin recovered swiftly, trading near $100,000 at the time of writing. The flagship cryptocurrency has remained in an overall uptrend, likely bolstered by today’s US inflation data for November, which largely aligned with market expectations. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Peak In 200 Days, Before US Recession In Mid-2025, Report Says Bitcoin recently hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $103,679, according to data from CoinGecko. However, its price has fluctuated above and below the pivotal $100,000 mark, leading to over $1.5 billion in liquidations in the past week. Several factors could drive Bitcoin’s price to a new ATH. For instance, BTC reserves on cryptocurrency exchanges have hit multi-year lows, reflecting rising demand for the digital asset. American financier and former investment banker Anthony Scaramucci recently predicted China might establish its own Bitcoin reserve if the US proceeds with its strategic Bitcoin reserve plans. National BTC reserves are expected to reinforce Bitcoin’s supply scarcity narrative, potentially driving prices higher. At the same time, BTC adoption among corporations continues to rise, as Canadian video-sharing firm Rumble became the latest company to unveil a BTC treasury strategy.

37537493,https://cryptonews.com/?p=318844,1733982717,US Bankers Are Cautious Towards Cryptos Despite Upcoming Pro-Crypto Administration,"Some executives from major US banks have taken a cautious approach to cryptos, regardless of President-elect Trump’s crypto-friendlier stance and pro-crypto promises. Speaking at the Reuters NEXT conference in New York, bankers stressed that they are still skeptical about the regulations surrounding the asset class. David Solomon, Goldman Sachs Chief Executive, told Reuters that the crypto regulatory framework “has to evolve”. “Everyone’s speculating as to how that regulatory framework will evolve, but it’s still unclear.” The President-elect, Donald Trump, branded himself as a pro-crypto president, making several promises , including a strategic national crypto stockpile. Recently, Trump nominated seasoned Washington attorney Paul Atkins to chair the SEC , a move welcomed by the crypto community. Meanwhile, venture capitalist and ex-PayPal COO David Sacks has been nominated as Trump’s administration’s “AI and crypto czar.” Despite all these developments and the regulatory easing, banks are not in a rush to “head-first into the volatile asset.” Solomon further said that Goldman Sachs would first “evaluate” dealing with highly speculative assets like Bitcoin if the rules change. Additionally, he stressed that the banks’ ability to act in these markets is “extremely limited at present.” Another banker, Robin Vince, CEO of the Bank of New York Mellon, stressed the need for appropriate guard rails before developing anything new in crypto policy. Any new regulations must be “battle-tested through a few macroeconomic cycles,” he added. “We’ve seen a couple of cycles already in crypto. We’ll have to see how some of these assets evolve.” Past Crypto Turmoils Hold Back Bankers from Dealing With Crypto The biggest crypto turmoil in the crypto industry – the FTX exchange debacle – has left bankers uncertain about dealing with cryptos. Bank regulators have also become more vigilant after last year’s collapse of lenders Silvergate and Signature Bank. “One of my biggest fears for any administration is that they forget the lessons that we were meant to have learned from many previous crises,” Johnson noted. Johnson also said that Client demand for crypto remains limited, even with regulatory easing. Matt Gellene, Bank of America’s head of Consumer Investments and Employee Banking & Investments agreed to johnson. “Bank of America offers some clients exposure to cryptocurrencies via exchange-traded funds, but there was ‘not an overwhelmingly large amount of interest.’” The post US Bankers Are Cautious Towards Cryptos Despite Upcoming Pro-Crypto Administration appeared first on Cryptonews .",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/us-bankers-cautious-towards-cryptos-despite-pro-crypto-admin/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37537493.jpeg

37531079,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51936,1733982456,"Here’s Why XRP, ADA, ALGO, and HBAR Will be Tax Free As Confirmed By Eric Trump","The cryptocurrency market is abuzz with speculation following Eric Trump’s recent comment about a notable policy from the incoming administration. Shawn (@oroogle), a prominent cryptocurrency enthusiast on X shared Eric Trump’s comments. If the proposed policy is enacted under the coming Donald Trump administration, it could significantly alter the dynamics of the global cryptocurrency market by offering substantial tax advantages to U.S.-based crypto assets. According to Shawn’s initial report from November, the policy aims to eliminate all capital gains taxes on cryptocurrencies created by U.S.-registered entities. This change would apply to prominent digital assets such as XRP, ADA, ALGO, and HBAR, as their issuing companies are headquartered in the U.S. By contrast, non-American crypto assets could face up to a 37% tax on gains, putting them at a distinct disadvantage in the U.S. market. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? Shawn’s analysis highlights the potential for this policy to drive significant investment into American crypto projects. He noted that this would make all profits Americans make on holding cryptocurrencies tax-free. He further suggested that the proposed framework would incentivize non-U.S. crypto projects to relocate their operations to the U.S. to benefit from the tax exemption. This initiative appears to align with a broader strategy by the Trump team to establish the U.S. as a global leader in cryptocurrency innovation. As Trump stated earlier in the year, the U.S. will become the “ crypto capital of the world ” If enacted, this policy could cause a migration of blockchain and fintech companies to the U.S., fostering economic growth and innovation while creating a competitive edge for American digital assets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Widespread Support From the Community The proposed policy has garnered support within the crypto community. Shawn started a poll on the matter, receiving over 14,000 votes, with 88% of participants expressing support. Many see this as a long-overdue correction to what they perceive as unfavorable cryptocurrency policies under the Biden administration. This policy could provide a dramatic boost for assets like XRP. The digital asset has faced regulatory challenges recently, including its high-profile legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A tax-free environment could enhance its appeal to U.S. investors and help drive adoption. Moreover, this policy could spur innovation in blockchain technology by increasing competition among U.S.-based projects. It could also stimulate broader adoption of cryptocurrencies, as investors are drawn to the financial incentives associated with holding tax-free digital assets.

Satoshi Nakamoto Predicted 15 Years Ago,"Concerns about the security of Bitcoin’s private keys have resurfaced following developments in quantum computing, particularly discussions about the capabilities of the quantum chip “Willow.” However, cybersecurity expert Yu Xian, founder of blockchain security firm SlowMist, assured the crypto community that there is no immediate cause for alarm. Quoting crypto researcher Jeffrey Scholz, Yu Xian said, “Current tens of gates in quantum computing are at least millions of gates away from being able to crack Bitcoin private keys. Quantum gates are incredibly difficult to scale, as higher gate counts result in higher noise and error rates, rendering the machine useless in real-world scenarios.” “Don't worry about Satoshi Nakamoto's private key, at least not for the next few decades,” he added. The renewed focus on quantum computing has drawn attention to comments made by Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto in 2010 regarding the robustness of Bitcoin’s cryptographic hash algorithm, SHA-256. Satoshi had said: “SHA-256 is very strong. It’s not like a gradual step from MD5 to SHA1. It can last for decades unless there’s a major breakthrough attack.” Related News: After Today's CPI Report, Former FED Member Mester Shares Prediction on Rate Cuts Satoshi also outlined contingency plans for a possible cryptographic breakthrough, emphasizing the adaptability of the Bitcoin protocol. He suggested an orderly switch to a new hashing algorithm in case SHA-256 is compromised. Despite advances in quantum computing, researchers agree that the technology is far from a credible threat to Bitcoin. Current quantum computers are limited in scale and face significant hurdles, such as error correction and noise reduction, before they can tackle complex cryptographic problems like cracking Bitcoin’s private keys. *This is not investment advice.

37531077,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51891,1733981446,Is The 2024 Bull Run Over? These 3 Projects Continue To Rally,"The recent pause in the crypto market has many investors wondering if the 2024 bull run is over. However, experts are pointing out that crypto casino Rollblock (RBLK) and meme coins Floki (FLOKI) and Pepe (PEPE) continue to rally. Rollblock’s project is catching the most attention as it races toward the conclusion of its crypto presale. This top altcoin recently had its 2025 growth estimates increased to over 100x after its successful listing on CoinMarketCap. Floki’s GameFi Expansion Promises Further Explosive Growth The Floki price is actually trailing in the meme coin sector this bull run, with only 90% growth last month. However, this week saw the Floki price rocket ahead with almost 30% in GameFi-driven growth. Floki just began offering its flagship play-to-earn game, Myr, in the enormous Indian market. The rapid success of this play-to-earn expansion has led to explosive demand for Floki tokens. Experts believe that this is just the beginning for Floki’s rally, as it combines GameFi and meme coins into viral success. Whale Activity Sends Pepe Soaring Toward Top 10 Tokens Pepe is another meme coin that continued to charge ahead this week despite the downturn in the overall market. The Pepe price added another 35% this week, bringing its monthly return to over 150%. This sudden surge in the Pepe price has been caused by a significant increase in whale activity. Pepe saw over $300 million worth of its tokens taken off crypto exchanges this month, which usually indicates enormous whale purchases. Pepe has already seen over 1,500% growth so far in 2024, and experts think it could break into the top 10 tokens by 2025. CoinMarketCap Listing Puts Millions of Investors’ Eyes on Rollblock’s Astronomical Potential Rollblock made an even bigger splash than Floki and Pepe this week when it cracked an over 300% total return over the course of its crypto presale so far. This top altcoin’s fresh listing on the famous CoinMarketCap platform sent it racing through the final tokens in the eighth stage of its crypto presale and saw a significant increase to its post-ICO growth estimates. A listing on the CoinMarketCap platform means millions of potential crypto investors will now be able to find Rollblock in their research. This listing was one of the last targets in Rollblock’s ambitious white paper, and now it is almost ready for its big ICO. Rollblock also recently added a sports betting platform to its offering of over 7,000 of the industry’s top provably fair games. This expansion gave Rollblock full coverage of the $500 billion gambling industry and set the stage for its current astronomical growth estimates. Experts are most excited about Rollblock’s plans to share its profits through weekly buybacks funded by the casino’s own revenue. These buybacks will either be burned to maintain market pressure on RBLK or used as staking rewards to further incentivize holders. Rollblock’s recent listing on CoinMarketCap sent most growth estimates for its post-ICO price to 100x or higher from its current $0.041. This ICO could occur as soon as January of 2025, with only three stages remaining in Rollblock’s crypto presale. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

He said his firm only allowed its clientele to put up to 10% of their total assets into crypto. Peterffy believes that everyone without Bitcoin should find ways of owning some, but not too much, due to the associated risk of price fluctuations. He was, however, concerned that cryptocurrencies were just as worthy as paper currencies since they carried no intrinsic value. Having grown up in a socialist society, Peterffy was convinced that a free market economy was the only way to run a society efficiently. Peterffy believes everyone should invest a little in Bitcoin but remain cautious Thomas Peterffy, the billionaire founder of retail brokerage Interactive Brokers Group, said investors should own some Bitcoin though limit their holdings given the asset’s volatility. https://t.co/CJdDesLYbg — Bloomberg (@business) December 11, 2024 Peterffy, the chair of the retail brokerage firm Interactive Brokers, said investing a small portion in Bitcoin was advisable. He, however, cautioned against having too much exposure to cryptocurrencies in general because it was ‘dangerous’. Peterffy, who was initially critical of Bitcoin, argued that Bitcoin should be separated from the ‘real economy’ as the CME prepared to launch Bitcoin futures. The Interactive Brokers chair went on to predict that Bitcoin could bring down the whole economy. Peterffy was surprised that the rapid implosion of the FTX crypto empire in November did not cause a steeper Bitcoin correction. He also forecasted a market downturn, although he predicted it would not be ‘very violent’ or ‘go very far’. Speaking with Bloomberg’s Sonali Basak from the Goldman Sachs Inc. conference, Peterffy revealed that he had invested ‘just a little’ in crypto since July 2021. He added that there was a small chance of crypto emerging as a dominant currency back then. “Even I myself have put a little bit of money into crypto, because even though chances are, I think, that this is not going to be a viable market, I think that there’s a small chance that this will be a dominant currency, so you have to play the odds.” – Thomas Peterffy Peterffy remained unsure about Bitcoin’s worth, saying that its price could either spiral down to zero or skyrocket to a million dollars. ‘I have no idea,’ he said. He, however, advised investors to use crypto as a hedge against plummeting fiat currencies. Peterffy claimed that his platform was the most efficient for crypto trading, other than Robinhood. Interactive Brokers introduces AI-generated news for faster investment decisions Interactive Brokers introduced AI-powered functionalities to help investors make smarter and faster decisions. Steve Sanders, the EVP of Marketing and Product Development at Interactive Brokers said AI enabled the retail brokerage firm to deliver valuable insights in seconds. He said the new feature would help Interactive Brokers’ investors understand how breaking news affected their portfolios. Leveraging the power of AI, the tool extracted market-relevant information, which allowed clients to scan for important updates quickly and gave them more time to make informed decisions about managing their portfolios. According to Interactive Brokers, the ability to filter news-related asset classes in portfolios and wish lists made it easy for investors to stay up-to-date, which directly impacted their investments. Sanders clarified that the AI-generated news summaries feature gave investors a powerful way to pinpoint the information that mattered most, making research fast, impactful, and accessible.

The SEC's solicitation of public comments on Bitwise's proposed Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETF signals a growing interest in diversified crypto investment products, while BlackRock and Fidelity's recent $500 million ETH purchase show the increasing role of institutional capital in shaping the market. Ethereum Surges as BlackRock and Fidelity Acquire $500M in Ether Through Spot ETFs Financial titans BlackRock and Fidelity have collectively purchased $500 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) over the past two days. The acquisitions, executed primarily through Coinbase and its institutional service platform Prime, were reported by the crypto data tracking platform Arkham. The massive purchases coincide with record-breaking inflows into BlackRock's Ethereum spot ETF (ETHA) and Fidelity's equivalent, FETH. On Dec. 10 alone, ETHA and FETH reported trading volumes of $372.4 million and $103.7 million, respectively. These ETFs have cemented their positions as market leaders, contributing significantly to the all-time high inflows witnessed on Nov. 30. The momentum is partly fueled by the US Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) approval of eight Ethereum spot ETFs earlier this year, including those from BlackRock and Fidelity. The regulatory green light, granted on May 23, marked a pivotal moment in legitimizing cryptocurrency investments for institutional players. Ethereum’s Price Action Reflects Growing Demand Ethereum's price surged over 6% to $3,931.16 in the last 24 hours, with trading volumes surpassing $39.3 billion during the same period. The cryptocurrency’s robust performance signals strong market confidence, driven by the massive institutional inflows. BlackRock and Fidelity's combined $500 million purchase represents a strategic investment in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The acquisitions are a strong indicator of the increasing adoption of digital assets by traditional financial institutions. The ripple effect of these transactions extends beyond Ethereum. The influx of institutional capital often bolsters market sentiment, attracting retail investors and further driving demand. Ethereum’s ecosystem, known for its robust DeFi and NFT frameworks, stands to benefit significantly from this increased liquidity. The broader cryptocurrency market also saw gains, with major indices reflecting a positive trend. For instance, the GMGM Top Gaming Tokens index rose by 17.78%, while the GMSMALL Small Caps index jumped 12.13%, signaling renewed optimism across the digital asset space. Ethereum ETFs like ETHA and FETH have revolutionized how institutions and retail investors access Ethereum. These funds offer a regulated, simplified avenue to invest in the cryptocurrency without the need for direct custody, addressing key concerns around security and compliance. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, and Fidelity, a global financial services powerhouse, have been at the forefront of this transformation. Their aggressive positioning in the Ethereum ETF market suggests they have a long-term confidence in the cryptocurrency’s potential as a store of value and a key driver of decentralized applications. Overall, the $500 million Ethereum acquisition by BlackRock and Fidelity marks a significant milestone in the evolution of institutional crypto investment. As Ethereum’s price and trading volumes continue to climb, the cryptocurrency solidifies its status as a cornerstone of the digital economy. With record-breaking inflows into spot ETFs and increasing regulatory clarity, Ethereum’s future appears brighter than ever. The backing of financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity not only validates the asset’s potential but also paves the way for further adoption in traditional financial markets. As 2024 draws to a close, Ethereum’s ascent showcases the maturing relationship between cryptocurrencies and institutional finance. SEC Seeks Public Input on Bitwise Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF Listing In other ETF news, United States regulators are advancing the application process for the listing of a proposed Bitwise ETF holding both BTC and ETH. According to a Dec. 10 filing , the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is soliciting public comments on NYSE Arca’s request to list the innovative ETF, signaling progress in the regulatory review process. Bitwise, a prominent crypto asset manager, first submitted the ETF proposal alongside NYSE Arca on Nov. 26. The fund aims to offer investors “balanced exposure to the two largest crypto assets in the world in an easy-to-access format,” Bitwise noted in a post on X. The ETF would operate as a spot cryptocurrency index fund, providing direct exposure to BTC and ETH rather than relying on derivatives or futures contracts. This design aligns with a growing demand for transparent and straightforward investment vehicles in the digital asset market. The Bitwise Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF enters a market increasingly crowded with similar products. Industry analysts highlight that crypto index ETFs are becoming the next frontier for issuers, building on the momentum of funds holding single assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which launched earlier this year. “The next logical step is index ETFs because indexes are efficient for investors — just like how people buy the S&P 500 in an ETF. This will be the same in crypto,” said Katalin Tischhauser, head of investment research at crypto bank Sygnum, in an August interview. In addition to the Bitwise Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, NYSE Arca has filed to list the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund, which would include a broader selection of cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, Grayscale, Hashdex, and Franklin Templeton have also submitted proposals for similar index funds, intensifying the race to dominate the burgeoning market. Regulatory Developments: A Changing Landscape The SEC’s request for industry comments signals a shift toward increased engagement with stakeholders regarding cryptocurrency ETFs. Under current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, the agency has taken a stringent approach to crypto regulation, launching more than 100 enforcement actions since 2021. However, this regulatory climate is poised for significant change with the incoming US administration. President-elect Donald Trump, who assumes office on Jan. 20, 2025, has promised to make the United States the “world’s crypto capital.” Trump is reportedly assembling a crypto-friendly leadership team to oversee key financial regulatory agencies. Gensler, whose term has been marked by friction with the crypto industry, confirmed his departure once Trump takes office. This transition could herald a more accommodating regulatory environment for cryptocurrency products, spurring optimism among issuers. The timing of Trump’s pro-crypto platform has coincided with a flurry of ETF applications, ranging from spot crypto funds to staking-based ETFs, reflecting growing confidence in a supportive regulatory future. If approved, the Bitwise Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF would mark another milestone in the integration of cryptocurrency into mainstream financial markets. ETFs offer a regulated, user-friendly gateway for retail and institutional investors, addressing common concerns about custody and compliance. Moreover, the approval of index ETFs could revolutionize how investors approach cryptocurrency portfolios. By diversifying holdings across multiple assets, these funds lower risk and simplify exposure to the broader digital asset market, mirroring traditional index strategies like those seen with the S&P 500. Despite optimism, challenges remain. The SEC has historically been cautious about approving spot cryptocurrency ETFs due to concerns about market manipulation and insufficient regulatory oversight of underlying assets. The solicitation of public comments represents a step forward, but ultimate approval will depend on whether issuers can address these longstanding issues. Competing ETF proposals also highlight the competitive nature of the market. With major players like Grayscale, Hashdex, and Franklin Templeton vying for approval, Bitwise will need to demonstrate clear advantages in terms of fund structure, transparency, and investor benefits.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6502/ethereum-gains-momentum-as-black-rock-and-fidelity-invest-500-million,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Crypto King Musk (MUSKKING), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKKING is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Crypto King Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crypto King Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Crypto King Musk launched with over $7,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crypto King Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Crypto King Musk by entering its contract address – v2jWiNpR1m8gHARdM39GosZ8muaxZpowpBgWgWTSCev – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKKING.

37529226,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392060,1733980405,Why Peanut the Squirrel ($PNUT) Is Up Today: The Meme Coin’s Latest Surge,"The post Why Peanut the Squirrel ($PNUT) Is Up Today: The Meme Coin’s Latest Surge appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto world has gone nuts over Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT), a Solana-based meme coin that’s stealing the spotlight. Following Coinbase’s announcement of plans to list $PNUT for trading, the token skyrocketed 19% in just an hour, hitting $1.27 with a market cap of $1.27 billion. Inspired by the internet-famous squirrel Peanut, the coin has gained extra attention after the squirrel’s controversial euthanization by New York authorities. After an X post from Elon Musk, the Peanut meme coin (PNUT) skyrocketed, with its market cap leaping from $3 million to $140 million in just 24 hours. While its price saw steady growth since mid-November, it recently dipped 9.7%, now trading at $1.11. This drop appears to be part of a broader market downturn rather than specific to PNUT. While Bitcoin is circling the $100K mark with recent ups and downs investors are taking a chance with new coins especially the low-cap assets to divert the portfolio to minimize risk. We have seen many such pumps in the memes and altcoins sector in the last few weeks. Yet Another Meme Rises with “Coinbase Effect” The memes saw a massive surge in the crypto space after Donald Trump’s win. Leading the pack is Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) which pumped with effect from Coinbase’s plans to list it, echoing the exchange’s newfound focus on meme tokens like Mog Coin (MOG) and Turbo (TURBO). Recently GIGA hit an all-time high of $0.077, while TURBO jumped 15% after its listing was announced. Known as the “Coinbase Effect,” such announcements often spark price surges, with PNUT gaining 19% recently. Risky Yet Rewarding Despite its highs, PNUT is still 45% below its November peak of $2.44, achieved after a Binance listing. However the Binance officially listed PNUT, it went up by 320% surge in its value. The listing cemented its position as the top meme coin on Solana’s Pump.fun platform, where over four million meme tokens have been created. While meme coins like PNUT can deliver massive gains—one trader turned $16 into $3 million—they remain highly volatile and risky, often swinging wildly in value.

This approval gives RLUSD a high regulatory standard, and the transparency offered by audits will be appealing to users. Experts believe stablecoins will play a key role in cross-border payments and solve many of the problems with traditional payment methods. Stablecoins are fast, available 24/7, borderless, and transparent, which makes them a strong option for the future of payments. XRP Meme Tokens: Could Listings Be Coming Soon? On the other hand, XRP is starting to see increased activity with meme tokens, raising questions about whether these tokens might eventually be listed on platforms. Nancy Beaton, President of Uphold U.S., confirmed that Uphold has already listed several meme tokens. On The Paul Barron Network, she explained that Uphold has a thorough process for listing tokens. They actively seek out tokens in the market, and people can also submit their tokens for review. However, only around 30% of the tokens they review get approved for listing. Beaton also encouraged meme token creators to reach out to Uphold so they can begin the due diligence process and potentially make their tokens available to Uphold customers. XRP’s Higher Token Launch Costs Could Reduce Scams An X user pointed out that creating a meme coin on XRP requires 123 XRP, and as the price of XRP increases, it will become more expensive to launch a token. For example, if XRP hits $10, it would cost $1,230 to create a token. This increase in cost could reduce the number of scams and promote more legitimate projects. In comparison, launching a token on Solana is much cheaper, which has led to many low-quality and scam tokens. The user believes that while there may still be some bad projects on XRP, the higher cost will likely reduce scams and contribute to a more trustworthy market.",POSITIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-news-rlusd-stablecoin-approved-is-xrp-meme-coin-listing-next/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

The motion was approved on Wednesday to explore Bitcoin’s municipality use cases, such as accepting it as a payment method or directly investing in the asset. One of Canada’s largest cities, Vancouver, is considering exploring Bitcoin’s municipal use cases. On Wednesday, the Vancouver City Council passed a motion to make the city a Bitcoin-friendly municipality. Although the motion seeks to explore the regulatory acceptance of BTC, it may mean something other than the municipality accepting BTC as a payment method or directly investing in the asset anytime soon. However, it could pave the way for the municipality to accept tax payments in BTC or convert part of the city’s reserves into Bitcoin. Mayor Ken Sim proposes to make Vancouver a Bitcoin-friendly city Vancouver city council approves Mayor Ken Sim's motion to explore becoming a ""bitcoin-friendly city,"" including accepting Bitcoin for taxes/fees and possibly converting part of reserves into crypto. Sim also donates $10K in Bitcoin to the city. 🚀💰 But concerns over volatility,… pic.twitter.com/6cajLVMbZg — Crypto Spy Fox 🦊🪙 (@CryptoSpyFox) December 12, 2024 Mayor Ken Sim initiated and championed the proposal and later supported by his ABC Vancouver councilors, while two Green councilors opposed it. Ken Sim said during a phone interview that he had longed to initiate the proposal for a while but felt the public needed more time to be ready to have the conversation. Ken Sim mentioned that he decided to be more vocal about his pro-crypto stance after seeing the recent developments in the United States and other nation-states showing signs of embracing Bitcoin’s utilities. Sim announced the motion in late September titled “Preserving the City’s Purchasing Power Through Diversification of Financial Reserves—Becoming a Bitcoin-Friendly City.”. The motion states that integrating BTC into Vancouver’s finances could shield the city from the volatility, debasement, and inflationary pressures of fiat currencies and preserve its purchasing power. It also highlights that embracing Bitcoin is a pro-innovation agenda that supports emerging technologies. Since then, Sim has been vocal about Bitcoin and its underlying technology. He called the asset the “greatest invention” in the history of mankind and stated that fiat currency would depreciate to zero. The official believes Bitcoin is undervalued and currently only worth a fraction of its future worth but emphasized that he was not in a position to give financial advice. Ken Sim promises to donate 10,000 in Bitcoin to Vancouver In an interview with Global News, Ken Sim said he used to be skeptical about BTC and digital currencies until he spent 10,000 hours researching the topic. He said he changed his mind, and digital assets are now part of his family’s investment portfolio. The mayor’s financial disclosure revealed he has investments in Coinbase Global, a publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange, and the Canadian Bitcoin exchange-traded fund Purpose BTC ETF. Before the vote, the official promised to donate $10,000 in BTC to the city regardless of the council’s outcome. Although most of the council voted in favor of the motion, some, like Green Coun. Pete Fry expressed their criticism, citing BTC’s potential use as a money laundering tool, which is a major problem that underpins Vancouver’s drug and housing turmoil. The West Coast Canadian city is considered one of the crypto hubs worldwide. The city claims the title of having the world’s first Bitcoin ATM, which was installed back in 2013.

That's putting a bigger focus on nuclear energy, and with it — according to one venture capital company — the need for better ways to trade the fuel that makes fission possible.  For crypto-focused VC firm Portal Ventures, the answer was downright radioactive. The firm is leading a $1.7 million round in Uranium Digital, a startup that tokenizes uranium ore for easier trading than was ever possible in the highly regulated metal's surprisingly underfinancialized market.  A ""major nuclear renaissance from AI"" is afoot, predicted Portal Ventures General Partner Catrina Wang. Her firm wrote the biggest check for Uranium Digital after concluding the startup was using crypto rails to more effectively tap into a ""latent market.""  Uranium Digital isn't the only effort to shake up the tightly controlled market for the most critical component of nuclear fuel. Just last week a separate startup started selling exposure to yellowcake (a form of powdered uranium) atop the Tezos blockchain.  According to Uranium Digital's founder Alex Dolesky, his firm is the best-positioned to get the job done. He realized trading commodities years ago that, perplexingly, this commodity didn't have a mature and robust market on par with gold, silver and other metals. Because of its tight controls, it traded solely in opaque deals across OTC desks manned by institutional players — inaccessible to retail traders.  Enter tokenization. Tokens alone can't power a nuclear reactor. But Uranium Digital represents yellowcake with tokens that anyone can trade. To keep things kosher the underlying metal sits in storage, inaccessible to anyone but buyers with the right licensure to claim physical settlement.  ""What we're creating is the first vector where you have an actual functioning commodity contract underlying spot uranium, and a vector where both retail and institutional volume can converge,"" Dolesky said.  He said the increased participation will be a boon for efficiency and price discovery.  This is where Uranium Digital differs from many of the crypto startups that CoinDesk covers in 2024. It isn't going to issue its own ""token"" to represent decentralized governance, or whatever. Instead, it's a pure-play blockchain-as-a-solution company.  ""Its kind of a traditional VC equity-style play in the way that value accretes,"" Dolesky said.  For his part, Dolesky is playing the AI bet a bit more conservatively than his startup's biggest backer. He says that uranium trading is at such an early stage that ""we first need to establish a financialized market.""  But he's well aware that the Microsofts, Googles and other tech majors of the world are leaning into an AI future that will, inevitably, need massive amounts of power that nuclear power is well-equipped to deliver.  ""They need uranium for reactors and we want to be part of the procurement solution,"" he said.",POSITIVE,없음,FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | XTZ,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/12/12/power-hungry-ai-fuels-crypto-vc-s-bet-on-tokenized-uranium-startup,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/69a381448da79a5c7ae90f99434be71680253550-1980x1321.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

He advised investors to allocate between 2% to 3% of their net worth to Bitcoin. However, he cautioned against exceeding 10%, warning that doing so “would be very dangerous.” In a Bloomberg podcast published on Thursday, Peterffy admitted that he’s “scared” of cryptocurrencies due to their volatility. Furthermore, he described them as “basically just a figment of imagination.” “So it doesn’t have any underlying volume. The only value it has is the same as the paper dollar, which is nothing,” he said. Bitcoin Hits $100K as Regulatory Optimism Rises, but Overleveraging Looms Bitcoin has soared since Donald Trump’s election victory, driven by hopes for a more lenient cryptocurrency regulatory environment. It last traded around $100,959, up nearly 15% in a month. Thomas Peterffy voiced concerns about the risks of overleveraging as margin balances grow rapidly. He warned that a sharp Bitcoin drop could cause widespread bankruptcies, burdening clearinghouses with the fallout. Interactive Brokers began offering Bitcoin futures trading on the CBOE Futures Exchange in late 2017, and shortly after announced plans to include the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. By Sept. 2021, Interactive Brokers expanded into crypto trading through a partnership with Paxos Trust Company, enabling US clients to trade and hold Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash. Bill Miller Predicted Advisors Will Recommend 1-3% Bitcoin Allocation in Portfolios Thomas Peterffy’s recommendation for crypto portfolio allocation aligns with advice from other prominent figures. In October, renowned investor Bill Miller predicted that within three to five years, financial advisors would start suggesting a 1% to 3% allocation to Bitcoin in investment portfolios. Miller pointed to Bitcoin’s unique economic characteristics, saying it’s the only economic entity where the supply is unaffected by the demand or the price. He further explained that belief in Bitcoin’s future only requires the conviction that its demand will outpace its supply. Moreover, Miller highlighted Bitcoin’s resilience, noting that unlike traditional financial systems which needed central bank interventions during crises, Bitcoin has never required a bailout to maintain its functionality.

A brand-new sports betting feature will further boost Rollblock’s revenue at a time when its hugely varied offering of over 7,000 casino games is already bringing in enormous amounts of profit. This gaming token has a hard cap of a billion coins, meaning that no dilution can take place thanks to the kind of token printing so common in the crypto gaming niche. In fact, Rollblock’s supply is deflationary, as regular buybacks will see 60% of these purchases burned forever and the remaining tokens sent to staking rewards for committed community holders. This will lead to an extremely bullish lack of selling pressure in the markets. The coming supply squeeze will be glorious to behold. To learn more about Rollblock, visit the website and socials.

37528201,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=312435,1733978423,"In AI’s Data Divide, Blockchain Finally Empowers the Have-Nots","HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post For far too long, we’ve all been data have-nots. Our personal information has been hoarded in silos, owned by corporations and sold to the highest bidder. As we transition into the artificial intelligence (AI) age, this problem is not only persisting but intensifying. LLMs (large language models) are now learning from our data without compensating or even acknowledging the rightful owners. If data is indeed ‘the new oil,’ then we all deserve to tap into our reserves and share in its value. Blockchain offers a solution by ensuring transparency, fair compensation and immutable traceability. This approach effectively tackles some of AI’s most pressing challenges related to data privacy, accessibility and copyright. By solving the data ingestion problem, blockchain protocols and platforms promise ethical evolution while ensuring we all get our fair share of the AI pie. The state of play in AI AI’s come a long way in a short time. But almost two years after the much-hyped debut of mainstream generative AI, there’s already a data shortage on the horizon. Research indicates a growing mismatch between the availability of training data and the rapid advancement of computing power. This imbalance suggests that leading language models could exhaust their supply of fresh, high-quality data as soon as 2026. Despite an insatiable appetite, new and novel data sources are proving harder to come by, especially as critics question the information’s provenance and privacy. Data is therefore in great demand, evolving beyond mere fuel for innovation into a new asset class poised to generate trillions of dollars in value over the coming years. The next frontier is to harvest the unharvested and integrate workplace and personal information at scale while maintaining compliance. Unlocking these information reserves represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity that blockchain can spearhead and in which users can – and should – share. From data silos to shared successes Blockchain offers a compelling solution to AI’s data dilemma. Various protocols and platforms not only register and track information on-chain but also bring users into the data economy from the ground up. Take Sahara AI. The startup – which raised more than $40 million in August 2024 – incentivizes the users, data sources and AI trainers crucial to the technology’s success. Unlike other players, the company rewards rather than ignores the data contributors that power its decentralized blockchain platform. Story Protocol is another project furthering this concept – using blockchain to allow creators to establish ownership of their work, set rules for how it can be used and ensure they get paid when their content is utilized. We can see this ethos in action in blockchain gaming. Modular data layers in this sector empower users to own, control and monetize their data, unlocking new possibilities for AI-powered experiences both within gaming and beyond. This approach unifies gaming identities and allows players to selectively share their information with companies and advertisers for compensation. In turn, their data produces smarter systems and better outcomes. Further, beyond collecting new data, we need this larger pool of decentralized information to scale securely. Here, too, blockchain shows promise. Aethir , for example, unlocks enterprise-grade GPUs – strategically distributed to compute closer to users – to refine complex algorithms, process vast datasets and interface in real time. Whichever way you look at it, blockchain solves some of AI’s greatest pain points at a time when the sector needs to deliver on inflated expectations. Our data is the key, and we deserve compensation It’s important to solve these issues now. Three-quarters of consumers are more concerned about data privacy than ever before, and 70% believe they should share in profits from their data. While AI promises important strides, we risk repeating past mistakes if the sector doesn’t acknowledge and integrate the humans behind the insight. Also remember that the potential of AI, impressive as it is today, can be vastly expanded through ethical data inclusion. As more users control and share their data through blockchain, AI systems will gain access to high-quality, privacy-preserving datasets essential for training and optimization. This creates a virtuous cycle where AI drives genuine value while facilitating trust, privacy and ownership. Expect this to accelerate the development of AI agents and other new and improved integrations. This is a nascent sector, and it’s not too late to right data wrongs. Decentralizing from corporate control, acknowledging information sources and compensating rightful owners is a major step toward digital equality. Not only can we then bridge the AI data divide but we can also empower individuals to become active participants rather than passive subjects of data exploitation. By doing so, we wrest power from the data-haves and elevate the data-have-nots, creating a truly user-owned internet.

Dogecoin, XRP, & Bitcoin Recently Saw A Decline In Mean Dollar Invested Age In a new post on X, Santiment has discussed the latest trend in the Mean Dollar Invested Age indicator for a few of the top coins in the cryptocurrency sector. Related Reading: Crypto Suffers $1.6 Billion Liquidations As XRP, DOGE Down 10% The “Mean Dollar Invested Age” keeps track of the average age of every dollar the holders have invested into the cryptocurrency. This metric is similar to the Mean Coin Age, an indicator that measures the average age of tokens in the entire circulating supply. The Mean Coin Age uses on-chain data to determine when every coin was last moved on the network and calculates the mean for the supply based on it. The Mean Dollar Invested Age works on the same data, except that it converts the coins to their USD value based on the price at their last movement. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Mean Dollar Invested Age for five top digital assets: Bitcoin (BTC), XRP (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), Ethereum (ETH), and Chainlink (LINK). As displayed in the above graph, the Mean Dollar Invested Age has registered a decline for all five of these cryptocurrencies recently, but the scale of the drawdown has been quite small in the case of Ethereum and Chainlink. On the other hand, Bitcoin, XRP, and Dogecoin have witnessed a very significant decrease in the indicator. As for what it means when this metric trends down, Santiment explains: When a network’s Mean Dollar Invested Age line is moving down, it indicates that older, stagnant wallets (particularly from large key stakeholders) are circulating their dormant coins back into circulation, increasing network activity. While this suggests that the older hands are potentially participating in selling, another way to look at it could be that new capital is flowing into the market, buying up these dormant coins and bringing the average age down. Related Reading: Litecoin Not To Be Overlooked, Analytics Firm Says: Here’s Why Indeed, it seems historically, the pattern has proven to be bullish, as the analytics firm has pointed out: This is one of the key indicators throughout the history of each coin’s lifespan that helps validate that a bull market can and should continue. The 2017 and 2021 bull markets similarly did not come to a halt until assets’ mean ages started going “up” (getting older) again. Out of the three assets that have seen a sharp decline in the Mean Dollar Invested Age, Dogecoin has particularly stood out for both the scale and the speed of the drawdown; the average dollar invested into the memecoin has become 31% younger over the last eight weeks. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.403, down almost 2% in the last seven days.

37527858,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374323,1733977717,"Ripple Whale Deposits to Binance Reach 6-Month High, Over 2.66 Billion XRP Transferred","Whale deposits into Binance have surged to a six-month high, with over 2.66 billion XRP tokens moved to the exchange in the past 30 days. According to the latest analysis by CryptoQuant, this figure marks the largest influx of XRP by large holders since April 2024, indicating a notable uptick in activity among whales. These large inflows suggest that big XRP holders are actively transferring tokens across the network and engaging with Binance as a key exchange. Meanwhile, crypto whales purchased over 100 million XRP amidst the recent market volatility. These large investors capitalized on XRP’s drop below the $2 support threshold, likely due to signs pointing toward a possible price increase. The significant volume of XRP acquired suggests these market participants have strong faith in the token’s future performance despite the ongoing price fluctuations. XRP’s price has since recovered, and the asset was trading near $2.42 at the time of writing, surging by approximately 10% over the past day. This rebound is believed to be influenced by Ripple’s successful regulatory approval to launch RLUSD, its new stablecoin. Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed the approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) after a lengthy review process. In a December 10 X post , Garlinghouse mentioned that Ripple would soon reveal RLUSD’s exchange listings and partnerships.

37527838,https://crypto.news/?p=14318609,1733977636,Vancouver City Council passed motion to make the city “Bitcoin-friendly”,"On December 11, Vancouver city councilors voted in favor of Mayor Ken Sim’s motion to make the city “Bitcoin-friendly” and authorize staff to look into holding cryptocurrency in reserve. Mayor Ken Sim, who has been serving as mayor of Vancouver since 2022, said to CBC that he thinks investing in Bitcoin ( BTC ) is financially responsible in an era of inflation and market volatility and even agreed to donate $10,000 worth of BTC to the city from his personal holdings. City officials will now work to see if BTC can be incorporated into the city’s financial strategies and whether it can invest in cryptocurrency by converting a portion of Vancouver’s current financial reserve . The motion’s passing is in accordance with the city’s 2025 budget plan. The motion, which was filed in November, stated that it would be “irresponsible” if the city did not evaluate the “merits” of incorporating BTC into its strategic assets, in order to stabilize the city’s financial standing. This would cover accepting taxes and fees in BTC. Capped at a supply of just 21 million coins, BTC has frequently been described as a digital version of gold, one that may serve as a store of value that shelters from inflationary pressures.

Leading the way were several speakers, including experts such as Victoria Lemieux, head of the Blockchain research cluster at the University of British Columbia, for whom support for the council’s decision was a no-brainer. However, there have been concerns over the environmental footprint of BTC mining, as well as the volatility of cryptocurrency, making it a questionable option for city financial reserves. Lemieux also said, “ Mining BTC would take a lot of energy ” to CBC. You might also like: SEC charges 3 people in $2.9m Bitcoin scam Can Bitcoin be used as a reserve asset in Vancouver? The Bank of Canada’s Currency Act prevents cities from being able to send BTC as payment for local expenditures or even hold it as a reserve because they are confined to investments which do not come with financial risk. It goes on to explain that the only legal currency is physical money such as notes and coins, made and issued by the Bank of Canada or the Royal Canadian Mint. Crypto is considered a commodity and not money under Canadian law, according to the Canada Revenue Agency . However, Section 27.1 of the Bank of Canada Act permits the Bank to create a special reserve fund to absorb unrealized valuation losses resulting from movements in the fair value of the Bank’s investment portfolio. Although this provision does not directly address cryptocurrencies, it creates leeway regarding the assets the Bank of Canada could evaluate. While legislative changes would be required, Vancouver’s motion signals a potential shift toward integrating BTC into official financial portfolios. The motion, therefore, could indicate a readiness for Vancouver to contest the current status quo.

Meanwhile, Avalanche enjoys a spotlight moment, buoyed by Trump-era optimism and big players like David Sacks championing them. Amid all this optimistic chaos, a quiet revolution is brewing with presale success, adding a dose of excitement for investors hunting for the next big thing. Enter Qubetics ($TICS). With a revolutionary Multi-Chain Wallet and jaw-dropping presale stats, Qubetics is turning heads for all the right reasons. Let’s dive into why these projects are among the best altcoins to invest in right now. Qubetics ($TICS): Redefining Simplicity with Multi-Chain Wallets Have you ever juggled multiple crypto wallets, passwords, and networks just to manage your investments? What a drag, right? Qubetics Multi-Chain Wallet is more than just another wallet—it’s your one-stop shop for seamless crypto management. With this wallet, even small businesses get a leg-up. A bakery in Denver could accept Solana for cookies, while a non-profit in LA tracks donations in Tether—all without switching platforms. The wallet syncs transactions across major networks, making crypto integration less of a hassle and more of a delight. The Multi-Chain Wallet eliminates fragmentation and provides simplicity wrapped in robust security. The Qubetics presale is currently in its 12th stage, selling tokens at $0.0311. With over 305 million tokens sold to over 8,400 holders, the project has already raised $5.5 million. That’s momentum you don’t want to miss. If you’re not snagging $TICS before the weekend’s 10% price hike, so do you plan to invest wisely? For more information, refer to this AMA session . Avalanche ($AVAX): Can It Reclaim Its Lost Glory? Avalanche is flexing its scalability muscles, and it’s hard not to notice. With the recent rollout of the Avalanche 9000 update, this blockchain is solidifying its spot in the Web3 world. It’s now faster, leaner, and capable of handling a broader range of DeFi services. That’s no small feat in a space where being relevant feels like running on a treadmill cranked to full speed. What really gets people talking, though, is Avalanche’s uncanny knack for scoring big-name supporters. This token’s political backing is practically unprecedented with Vice President JD Vance openly holding AVAX. Not only has it gained a whopping 37% in the past month, but it’s also showing signs of long-term potential as a key player in decentralised finance. Think of it as the underdog that’s finally punching above its weight. Despite these wins, Avalanche still faces an uphill battle to reclaim its former glory of $54 highs. Its future hinges on developers embracing the updated ecosystem and, of course, the regulatory winds favouring decentralised solutions. Bitcoin: A Dramatic Price Decline Amid Trump Frenzy Ah, Bitcoin. The OG. The icon. While some naysayers might say its best days are behind it, let’s not forget its resilience. Bitcoin’s ability to bounce back is practically legendary. It’s still the barometer of the entire crypto market, dictating trends and sentiment. The recent slump below six figures isn’t entirely bad news. Savvy investors know dips are just dress rehearsals for the next bull run. With MicroStrategy dropping a cool $2.1 billion on Bitcoin recently, the smart money hasn’t left the building yet. Add to that the likelihood of more supportive policies from the incoming Trump administration, and it’s clear the king isn’t giving up its throne without a fight. The Clock’s Ticking—What’s Your Move? Whether it’s the revolutionary Multi-Chain Wallet from Qubetics, Avalanche’s sprint towards DeFi dominance, Bitcoin’s steadfast market influence, the crypto market is bursting with opportunities. But here’s the kicker: the time to act is now. Qubetics’ presale stage is closing fast, and every delay could mean missing out on gains that could change your life. So, what’s the game plan? Simple. Dive in. Explore. Invest. The best altcoins to invest in right now aren’t going to wait forever. Join the Qubetics’ top crypto presale and make it count.

These coins are on fire and analysts can’t stop talking about them — and let me tell you, they’re not just hype. Whether you’re into adorable memes, chilled-out vibes, or revolutionary new tech, there’s something for everyone on this list. Let’s start with BTFD Coin, because seriously, it’s hard to talk about meme coins without mentioning this red-hot presale that’s currently shaking the crypto world. With $3.4M already raised and a staggering 50 billion tokens sold, BTFD Coin is the real deal. And if you’re looking to get in before it takes off, you better move fast. The hype? It’s electric. The future? Absolutely explosive. Hold on tight as we dive into the best new meme coins to invest in December 2024 — the ones analysts are raving about, and that you won’t want to miss out on. Trust me, you’ll be seeing dollar signs in your sleep. Let’s get to it! 1. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Everyone’s Talking About There’s no denying it — BTFD Coin is sprinting to the top of the meme coin charts. With its $0.00012 presale price, BTFD Coin is practically begging to be part of your portfolio. Analysts are losing it over the $3.4M raised in presale funds, and the numbers just keep growing. Over 50 billion tokens sold and counting — this coin is hot enough to melt your screen. The community buzz is deafening, and with staking rewards offering a massive 90%+ APY, you can bet this one’s going to reward the early birds. Investing $1,500 at the current presale price will snag you 12.5 million $BTFD tokens, and if that $0.00012 price rises to $0.0006 (which it very well might), you’re looking at a potential $7,500 return. That’s 5x your investment, and let me tell you, it’s not out of the question. And that’s just the start — BTFD’s P2E game and the Bulls Squad are bringing more utility and fun to the table. This coin is a full package, and it’s coming for the top spot. Why this meme coin made it to this list: BTFD Coin is a no-brainer for anyone who wants to get in on next-gen meme coins. The presale success, high staking rewards, and future P2E potential make it a must-have. 2. Just a Chill Guy: The Laid-Back Meme Coin Everyone Needs in Their Life We all know a guy who’s just, well, chill. He doesn’t rush, he doesn’t sweat the small stuff, but he knows exactly when to seize an opportunity. Enter Just a Chill Guy — the ultimate meme coin for those who want a relaxed vibe with big potential. This coin is literally the embodiment of the “cool guy” meme, and it’s making waves for its easy-going yet effective approach to cryptocurrency. Experts are particularly excited about the potential for steady growth, thanks to its low supply and exclusive content drops that have generated insane interest. Talk about a coin that keeps things simple, but effective. Why this meme coin made it to this list: A low supply, strong community, and long-term vision make it a gem in the making. 3. Popcat: The Meme Coin That’s Popping Off Everywhere The Popcat meme has been one of the most viral on the internet — and now it’s a coin. If you’re not familiar, Popcat is a super simple meme involving a cat whose mouth opens and closes to a weird beat. Sounds silly, right? Popcat Coin knows how to turn goofy fun into something with real staying power. Analysts are calling it one of the best meme coins to invest in December 2024, and here’s why: Popcat Coin is a force to be reckoned with. With an already expanding community and an exploding presence on social media, Popcat Coin is proving that a silly meme can be seriously profitable. Keep an eye on it — the gains could be explosive. Plus, Popcat’s deflationary mechanics mean that as more people get involved, the supply shrinks, which could drive up the value. Why this meme coin made it to this list: Popcat Coin is the perfect storm of viral meme culture and crypto. 4. Neiro: The Meme Coin Carrying on Doge’s Legacy with Heart If you’re into memes with meaning, Neiro is your new go-to. Think of Neiro as Doge’s little sister, continuing the meme coin legacy but with her own twist. Adopted by the same woman who once owned Kabosu (the dog behind the Doge meme), Neiro’s journey is about more than just memes — it’s about community and purpose. Neiro’s Ethereum debut was no accident. On August 4th, 2024, exactly at 11:59:59pm UTC, during the New Moon, Vitalik Buterin showed his support, donating $500k to an animal welfare fund — the second time ever he’s interacted with a meme coin. Talk about a significant endorsement! Originally abandoned and placed in a stray dog shelter, Neiro’s story is all about resilience. After being rugged by the original devs, the community took over and made it 100% community-owned.

Pepe MAGA (PEPEMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe MAGA by entering its contract address – C3zan7DDUAxZDSLnSxpptmyARsvGAbah4KWQB5QokoFM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEMAGA.

A planned vote by the Senate Banking Committee was postponed after Senate Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown delayed the vote just minutes before it was set to occur on Wednesday morning, after the committee’s GOP members had arrived. Republican senators blocked Brown’s request to waive procedural rules and hold the vote later in the day, according to a Senate aide. The delay pushed Crenshaw’s vote into the afternoon, conflicting with a Senate rule that restricts committees from meeting after the Senate has been in session for two hours or past 2:00 p.m. EST. A waiver could have allowed the vote to proceed, but Republicans, under the direction of Ranking Member Senator Tim Scott, blocked the waiver. As a result, Brown will need to reschedule the vote, though it is unclear when this will happen. The request for comment is pending. As reported by Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett, Brown said, “This is why people hate Washington. Corporate special interests have run a disgusting smear campaign against Caroline Crenshaw, an Army reservist and public servant who has been nominated and confirmed by a Republican President and Republican Senate. She has been thoroughly vetted and has gone through every step in the nomination process. Republican Senators are doing the bidding of corporate special interests and standing in the way of her confirmation.” Crenshaw literally advocated for ignoring the Court of Appeals that oversees the SEC.

Its massive 665% rise this year has caught everyone’s attention. From dominating Solana’s decentralized exchange to smashing revenue records, Raydium has positioned itself as a key player in 2024. What brought so much fuel to the token, let’s find out. RAY Token’s Stunning Surge RAY has served its believers with incredible returns of 665.45% this year. With this, it became one of the top performing crypto. As Raydium is not a memecoin, this surge was not some pump and dump. It reflects the growing market confidence in the altcoin and its amazing role in the Solana ecosystem. Source : Dune Raydium now controls almost half of all Solana DEX volumes . In a single week, from December 2 to December 9, it processed $23 billion in trades. That’s more than what all its competitors—Orca, Pumpfun, Meteora, and Lifinity—achieved combined. This boost wasn’t random. The sudden spike in meme coin trading brought massive attention and activity to the platform. Breaking Records and Building Momentum Raydium isn’t just leading in volume. Over the past month, it generated $226 million in fees, outpacing giants like Uniswap and even Solana itself. Only Ethereum and Tether have done better. These numbers show the platform’s profitability and its growing importance in the DeFi space. Source : Tradingview But it’s not just about revenue. RAY’s technical indicators reveal strong buying interest. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for RAY shot up from 26 to 70 in just two days. While that level suggests a possible price correction, it also confirms the intense market momentum behind the token. What to Expect It looks like Raydium still got some fuel and the bullishness might not be over yet. If it could hold to its trend, RAY might hit $6.46 soon, however the resistance levels at $5.85 and $6.46 could be challenging. On the opposite side, if the momentum falls and price sinks, support levels between $5.26 and $5.19 can be very helpful. Source : Tradingview All eyes are on RAY to see if it can climb back to its ATH of $16.93 and break it. This is a long journey without any doubt, however with growing Solana ecosystem and memecoin hype, there are still hopes for a new All Time High. What’s next for RAY?

37526318,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623839,1733974200,Ethereum Whales Fuel December Hype for This Blockchain That Could Transform DeFi,"Cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors alike are buzzing with anticipation this December. But it’s not just about Ethereum or Bitcoin. A revolutionary new blockchain protocol is stealing the spotlight and positioning itself as a game-changer for the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) landscape. Enter Lightchain Protocol AI —a blockchain powered by AI that boasts groundbreaking technologies like Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). Ethereum whales—the biggest holders of ETH—have been making moves, and their confidence in Lightchain is fueling the excitement. But what’s behind the buzz and why could it shake up DeFi? Let’s explore. Ethereum Whales Are Betting Big Before we get into why Lightchain is grabbing attention, it’s important to understand Ethereum’s role in DeFi. Known as the backbone of decentralized applications, Ethereum has long reigned supreme in the blockchain ecosystem. However, challenges such as gas fees and scalability have left room for innovation—and that’s where Lightchain comes in. Reports from blockchain data analysts suggest that Ethereum whales have quietly started diversifying their holdings into the upcoming Lightchain Protocol AI’s token sale . These savvy investors are known for spotting disruptive blockchain technologies early—and betting on their long-term value. 💡 Here’s why this matters Whale activity often indicates strong belief in a project’s viability, and Lightchain is delivering the kind of innovation that gets these heavyweight investors excited. What Makes Lightchain a DeFi Game-Changer? Lightchain isn’t just another blockchain. It’s a leap forward in how AI meets decentralized technology. With features like the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the AI Virtual Machine (AIVM) , Lightchain is tackling the inefficiencies some DeFi platforms have struggled with for years. Here are four reasons why Lightchain could transform the DeFi space: 1. Proof of Intelligence (PoI): A Smarter Consensus Forget Proof of Work (energy-intensive) and Proof of Stake (exclusivity-dependent). Lightchain’s PoI rewards nodes not just for security tasks, but for performing valuable AI computations such as model training and optimization. This creates a more efficient system that incentivizes meaningful contributions while maintaining blockchain integrity. 2. AI Virtual Machine (AIVM): A Seamless Frontier One of Lightchain’s crowning features is the AIVM, a computational layer built to execute AI-specific tasks on the blockchain. Developers creating DeFi applications can now harness the power of AI to optimize user experiences, enhance security, and automate processes—all while benefiting from blockchain decentralization. This is innovation at its finest. 3. Decentralized Governance Built for Intelligence Token holders in the Lightchain ecosystem actively participate in governance decisions. Unlike traditional systems, Lightchain integrates AI to streamline these processes, making decision-making fair, transparent, and community-driven. 4. Privacy Meets Scalability Numbers matter in DeFi, and Lightchain balances the need to scale with the fundamental value of user privacy. By combining AI with blockchain, it ensures both are well-protected as the network grows. Why the Hype Matters The crypto space has seen its fair share of ambitious claims and projects. What sets Lightchain apart—and fuels its hype—is the credibility of its roadmap and the backing of industry leaders. Ethereum whales have recognized Lightchain’s potential to overcome Ethereum’s existing challenges (high gas fees and scalability bottlenecks). Adding to the excitement are key features that align with the future needs of DeFi users, whether they’re individuals or entire enterprises. 🌐 Lightchain’s Revolutionary Potential Experts predict Lightchain could enable the next wave of DeFi innovation, catalyzing projects that integrate AI into lending, staking, and liquidity pools. Imagine smarter algorithms determining optimal interest rates or LP strategies in real-time? Lightchain is making that future possible. December Presale Token Opportunity Timing is everything. Lightchain’s presale is officially live , giving both everyday investors and seasoned cryptocurrencies enthusiasts an opportunity to secure discounted tokens. With Ethereum whales signaling their belief in this blockchain, early adopters have a rare chance to invest in the future.

The Bigger Picture—DeFi’s Transformation Ethereum may continue to reign supreme in the short-term, but projects like Lightchain symbolize a shift in the DeFi ecosystem. Blockchain platforms that incorporate AI aren’t just disrupting the market—they’re redefining it. From enabling smarter transactions to fostering community-driven governance, the possibilities are just beginning to unfold. For those looking to do more than watch from the sidelines, the opportunity to participate in Lightchain Protocol AI offers an exciting and rewarding path forward. Imagine being part of a movement that bridges AI innovation with the decentralized ethos of blockchain.

Ready to explore why these three coins are the best meme coins to join this month? Let’s dive in. Own the Dip with BTFD Coin’s $3.4 Million Presale Let’s talk about BTFD Coin, one of the best meme coins to join this month. Standing for “Buy the F***ing Dip,” BTFD has captivated the crypto community with its aggressive growth and utility-driven features. With over $3.4 million raised in its presale and 50 billion tokens sold, this coin isn’t just riding the wave—it’s creating one. The Beta Game launch is the latest feather in BTFD’s cap. While the Beta version doesn’t yet reward players, it’s paving the way for an innovative play-to-earn ecosystem that promises big gains in the future. Combine that with 90% APY staking rewards, and you’ve got one of the most compelling meme coin investment opportunities on the market today. Now, let’s crunch some numbers. Imagine investing $3,000 in BTFD at the current presale price of $0.00012. That would get you 25 million tokens. Once the coin lists at $0.0006, your investment would soar to around $15,000—a stunning 400% ROI. With staking and gaming potential layered on top, BTFD is proving it’s not just a coin—it’s a movement. The Bulls, as the BTFD community is affectionately called, are running strong, and the momentum shows no signs of slowing. With the Beta Game live and staking rewards unmatched, now is the perfect time to join the dip. Floki Inu: Turning Utility into a Meme Coin Superpower Floki Inu has come a long way from being just another dog-themed cryptocurrency. This month, it took a giant leap forward by introducing debit cards in 31 European countries, including powerhouses like Germany, France, and Italy. The cards, which support both physical and virtual formats, allow users to spend cryptocurrencies such as FLOKI, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana at millions of merchants worldwide that accept Visa or Mastercard. What makes this launch even more impressive? Zero transaction and exchange rate fees—a true game-changer for users. While virtual cards are accessible globally, the rollout of physical cards is gradually expanding, setting the stage for Floki’s utility to grow even further. For a coin that started as a community-driven meme, Floki has redefined expectations by seamlessly blending fun with functionality. Is Floki shaping up to be the ultimate utility meme coin? With this launch, it’s certainly making its case. Brett: The Meme Star of Base Chain If you thought meme coins were all about quirky names and dog mascots, Brett is here to prove you wrong. Dubbed as “Pepe’s best friend,” Brett has emerged as one of the most talked-about tokens on the Base Chain. As the ecosystem rapidly expands, Brett is riding the wave of new projects and applications being built on this blockchain platform. In the past month, Brett’s value has surged by 59%, with analysts predicting its price could reach $0.50 by 2025 and $1.31 by 2030. This coin’s rise isn’t just about market performance—it’s a cultural icon representing the growing popularity of the Base Chain. As new projects continue to enrich the ecosystem, Brett’s position as a symbol of meme coin innovation is only solidifying further. Will Brett be the face of Base Chain’s meme revolution? It’s already making a strong argument. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, Floki’s utility-driven innovation, Brett’s cultural impact, and BTFD Coin’s explosive presale make this trio standout among the best meme coins to join this month. If you’re seeking a blend of functionality and fun, Floki is leading the charge. Brett’s rise on Base Chain signals a bright future for ecosystem-focused meme coins. But for those looking for unparallelled growth potential and community-driven energy, BTFD Coin is the ultimate choice. Don’t miss the chance to own the dip.

37525571,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392038,1733972984,XRP Price Prediction For December 12,"The post XRP Price Prediction For December 12 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple’s XRP is currently up by more than four percent and is trading at the $2.40 levels. The current chart for XRP remains largely unchanged and the primary outlook suggests that XRP could be in the later stages of a bullish structure. The question now is whether this is the breakout to new all-time highs or if the price will test the previous all-time high around $3.30. Key Support and Resistance Levels A reaction has been observed at the previous breakout point, which occurred at the 2021 high. The green line on the chart, representing this breakout point, was tested from above yesterday. It’s possible that XRP is still in wave three, with one more potential high before the market moves forward. Even if the price dips below the green line, indicating short-term weakness, there is a Fibonacci support zone between $1.5 and $1.7. However, the smaller-time frame support levels are more critical for the short term. Larger Time Frame Outlook The outlook remains that XRP is in the third wave of the cycle. This remains the case until the market shows significant deviation from this pattern. If this scenario plays out, after the completion of wave four, wave five could potentially take the price into the $5-$10 range. Critical Support Levels For the bullish scenario to hold, the price should ideally maintain the $1.99 level, which represents the 78.6% retracement of yesterday’s rally. In a more bullish case, the price should not dip below this level. Additional support levels are found between $2.20 and $1.99, including levels at $2.14, $2.07, and $1.99. This is the key zone where the price should hold before potentially pushing higher. While there is no guarantee that the pullback will happen, it’s also possible that waves A or one will form another high, leading to a five-wave move upwards. If the pullback occurs, the critical support area is where buyers should ideally step in.",POSITIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-december-12/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37525262,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=660936,1733972456,"Hidden Driver Of Bitcoin’s Rally: Coinbase Dominance Fades, Binance Takes The Lead","While Bitcoin (BTC) has previously shown significant momentum in this market cycle, recent insights suggest that liquidity sources beyond Coinbase may be driving the trend. A CryptoQuant analyst, Mignolet, specifically provided a detailed analysis of Bitcoin’s market, shedding light on the role of major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance in the ongoing bull cycle. Related Reading: Anthony Scaramucci Foresees China Bitcoin Strategic Reserve In 2025 Shifting Liquidity Dynamics And Exchange Roles In a recent post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform titled “Coinbase Dominance Remains Low,” Mignolet examined the trajectory of Coinbase’s influence on Bitcoin’s price movements. The analyst highlighted that while Coinbase played a crucial role in the initial stages of this year’s Bitcoin rally, its dominance has since diminished. This shift indicates a broader distribution of liquidity across the market, with Binance emerging as a significant player in sustaining the bullish momentum. Coinbase dominance remains low “However, just before the rise in September-October, Coinbase dominance actually declined and has not significantly increased even now (red box).” – By @mignoletkr More details 👇https://t.co/nmnPGuz3WK pic.twitter.com/mBSImH8MwD — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 11, 2024 Mignolet’s analysis points to a critical observation: Coinbase’s dominance in spot trading has notably declined during the second phase of Bitcoin’s current rally. His analysis revealed that Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were approved earlier this year, spurring a surge in Coinbase’s trading activity. This influx of liquidity was instrumental in driving Bitcoin prices upward and disrupting the traditional halving cycle expectations. However, as the rally progressed, Coinbase’s influence waned. The analyst emphasized that while Coinbase remains a pivotal source of liquidity, Binance has assumed a more prominent role in the current market phase. Mignolet wrote: Let me reiterate: I’m not saying that Coinbase liquidity is unimportant or insignificant. It’s incredibly important. What I am highlighting is that there’s an even more critical source of liquidity at play. = Binance Notably, Binance’s growing dominance suggests that liquidity flows from a wider array of participants, contributing to a somewhat decentralized and strong market structure. This redistribution could indicate broader institutional and retail interest in Bitcoin as traders and investors diversify their platforms. Bitcoin Sees Sharp Rebound Following a few days of correction dropping below the $95,000 price mark, Bitcoin has now seen a sudden rebound. Related Reading: As Bitcoin Trades Above $100K—Analysts Reveal What Could Be Next Particularly, at the time of writing, the asset has reclaimed the $100,000 price mark with a current trading price of $100,625, marking a 4% increase in its price.

Analyst Bluntz predicts Shiba Inu (SHIB) will see a parabolic break as DTX Exchange (DTX) and Ethereum (ETH) ride the bullish wave. Table of Contents Bluntz makes bullish Shiba Inu price forecast Early buyers of DTX Exchange see 500% gains with more ahead Analyst remains optimistic on Ethereum SHIB vs. DTX vs. ETH: Evaluating the first to skyrocket Bluntz recently boldly stated that Shiba Inu (SHIB) is set to soar high, which has excited many traders. In an environment where the crypto market looks ready to shine, DTX Exchange (DTX) and Ethereum (ETH) are also gaining traction. While ETH shows green price charts with technical indicators suggesting bull control, DTX is ranking among the top new ICOs. The phase six presale star has provided early buyers with a 500% return and further gains are expected. Bluntz makes bullish Shiba Inu price forecast Shiba Inu is among the best meme coins. Data shows that the price of Shiba Inu increased nearly 10% in the past 30 days. Its value fluctuated between $0.000020 and $0.000030. Crypto analyst Bluntz remains optimistic about Shiba Inu. In a recent X post, he said that the meme coin currently looks very strong. He noted that a parabolic break is coming soon, which may see SHIB reach $0.000080. This positive Shiba Inu price forecast is supported by its technical analysis. The meme coin is currently trading above its 30-day EMA of $0.000026 and its 50-day EMA of $0.000024, suggesting a continued uptrend. Early buyers of DTX Exchange see 500% gains with more ahead The DTX Exchange has also been making headlines, with many traders gravitating to it as it ranks among the hottest presales. The DTX token price has jumped 500% from its beginning, and its ICO event is now in phase six, this percentage will soon increase. The hype for DTX Exchange is growing since it could transform online trading. It aims to launch a hybrid trading platform with the best of CEX and DEX. Users will get access to over 120k asset classes, including bonds and crypto coins, at up to 1,000x leverage and no sign-up KYC checks. This will allow users to easily and anonymously tap into many markets, like the $133T bonds market. Those who own the DTX token will get governance voting rights, a percentage of the trading fee revenue made by DTX Exchange, and more. Currently, DTX is worth $0.12, but phase seven will bring a price jump to $0.14. A Tier-1 crypto exchange listing could also trigger a rally to $0.20, a 66% spike from its current price. You might also like: NVIDIA millionaire bets on SOL recovery as DTX eyes 55,000% gains Analyst remains optimistic on Ethereum Ethereum is one of the top 5 cryptocurrencies and is showing good price growth. In the past 30 days, the Ethereum price surged from around $3,200 to over $4,000, a near 20% increase. Market analyst Captain Faibik made a bullish Ethereum price forecast. In a new X post, he told his followers that this altcoin could reach $10,000 soon. The technical analysis for Ethereum supports this prediction. ETH is trading above its 20-day EMA of $3,637 and its 30-day EMA of $3,495. Its bull-bear power sits at -86 in the buy zone, suggesting that bulls could push this value up. SHIB vs. DTX vs. ETH: Evaluating the first to skyrocket Experts believe SHIB, DTX, and ETH are all altcoins to watch as they could see big price increases soon. However, many think that DTX Exchange stands out. This rookie will have a smaller market cap than its peers, which means potential faster price growth with less money. As such, some experts suggest that this altcoin may experience an 800% price surge in 2025. To learn more about DTX, visit their presale , website , or Telegram .

Per the Russian media outlet Naked Science , the solution is the brainchild of researchers at the Moscow Technical University of Communications and Informatics (MTSUSI). New BTC, ETH-powered Crime Fighting Tool? The research team was led by Anna Vanyushina, who published her findings along with two co-authors in an academic paper . Vanyushina et al explained that their solution involves tools that let investigators “visualize the Bitcoin blockchain.” The Moscow Technical University of Communications and Informatics in Moscow, Russia. (Source: Vissionery [CC BY-SA 4.0]) This could help police officers “find evidence of crimes related to cryptocurrency,” the researchers wrote. The scientists say they can help police conduct more sophisticated transaction analysis. And this will let investigators identify “connections between network participants and analyze cash flows.” Vanyushina et al said their tools “create graphs” that “visually show how assets are transferred between addresses.” This can make it easier for police and prosecution officials to understand blockchain network data and combat BTC and ETH-powered crime. Exclusive: The US is weighing harsher oil sanctions against Russia just weeks before Trump returns to office https://t.co/bMxQrzieia — Bloomberg (@business) December 11, 2024 The researchers say they piloted their solutions and algorithms on both the “Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain networks.” Researchers Used Bitcoin Node to Pilot Solution Vanyushina et al said they tested their solution using “real data from the Bitcoin and Ethereum protocols.” The resulting algorithm, they said, “can be adapted to various forms of blockchain data analysis” and “used to develop tools to combat criminal activity” in the crypto sector. Andrey Osin, a co-author of the paper, noted that the solution generates directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). In the mathematics world, a DAG is a graph with vertices and edges with no directed cycles. Here, each edge has a defined direction. Following these directions will never result in a closed loop. DAGs, Osin noted, “help improve the quality and interpretability of visualizations.” These, he claimed “are especially important for investigations of crimes related to the use of cryptocurrency payments.” “Graph visualization methods allow us to clearly show how assets are transferred from one crypto wallet to another on a blockchain. They let us achieve higher performance and scalability.” Anna Vyacheslavovna, MTSUSI researcher Co-author Marat Kiyamov explained that the team “set up a local Bitcoin node” to conduct its pilot, and “collected about 25.7 MB of data, including 46,700 blocks and their corresponding transactions.” Industrial facility damaged in missile attack on Russia's Taganrog, officials say https://t.co/92QYRN265h pic.twitter.com/P33S1xf1m5 — Reuters (@Reuters) December 11, 2024 AI-powered Innovation Kiyamov said that the team downloaded ETH data from the “Ethereum XBlock pro dataset,” including “blocks, transactions, contract, and call information.” The researchers explained that their method allowed them to convert binary format data from the Bitcoin network to “easy-to-understand” diagrams.

Pepe Loves Santa (PEPESAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Loves Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Loves Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Loves Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Loves Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Loves Santa by entering its contract address – 9FuN9o4pQgF3NF1v2saWvb7b9hNKDJ1DGU6LSbur437Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESAN.

The Tokyo-headquartered exchange now runs under the ticker “ CNCK ,” with warrants of trading under “CNCKW.” The listing was made possible by a now-consummated $1.3-billion SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) deal with Thunder Bridge Capital Partners IV. Coincheck Group Executive Chairman Oki Matsumoto celebrating the exchange’s listing on Nasdaq Wednesday. Oki Matsumoto, Coincheck Groups’s Executive Chairman, rang the opening bell in New York on December 11 to celebrate the occasion. “Going forward, [Coincheck] will leverage the strengths of a NASDAQ-listed company to further expand its cryptocurrency/web3 business through global recruitment, corporate acquisitions, and capital and business alliances,” a translated Japanese press release states. While some congratulated the custodial exchange, others on Japanese social media see the listing as a sign that talent is heading overseas due to the country’s high crypto taxes , and complained of high fees on the exchange.

It indicates that these assets are being transferred with the intention of being sold, which can create selling pressure and lead to price declines. Dogecoin (DOGE) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, DOGE appears bearish as it has formed an inverted hammer candlestick pattern at the crucial resistance level of $0.42. Additionally, it has also begun to show downside momentum, which partially confirms this bearishness. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action and historical price momentum, if DOGE remains below the $0.42 level, there is a strong possibility it could decline by 20% to reach $0.35 in the coming days. However, this bearish thesis is only valid as long as DOGE is trading below the $0.42 level, otherwise, it may fail. Despite this bearish outlook, the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on a daily time frame indicates that it is in an uptrend. Traders Bearish Outlook However, this bearish outlook is further supported by on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Data from DOGE’s long/short ratio indicates that short sellers are currently dominating.

The collection was trading at 27 ETH, equivalent to $102,600, outranking Bitcoin’s price of $101,000. Pudgy Penguins has been upbeat since it reached its highest point last week, trading at almost $62,000. After the NFT hit a record high, the project team said that Pudgy Penguins’ ecosystem token, PENGU , will shortly be released on Solana. The coin would benefit the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem and other stakeholders. Generally speaking, the floor price is the lowest price an asset sold on an NFT marketplace can fetch. Lil’ Pudgys and Pudgy Rods (also known as Rogs), two of the NFTs’ companion collections, have increased by over 90% in the past seven days, indicating a significant uptick in the Pudgy ecology. Pudgy Penguins is the second Largest NFT after CryptoPunks With the floor price rising above $100,000, Pudgy Penguins has become one of the largest NFT collections. It only plays second to CryptoPunk, the NFT powerhouse with a floor price of 39.5 ETH, translating to ($150,000). The Pudgy Penguins collection has 8,888 distinctive NFTs, which have experienced widespread buying sprees. CoinGecko says its price has grown to 194% over one month. It is unclear why the price of the NFT is rising this fast, but analysts are citing the announcement of PENGU as the reason. Although the release dates for PENGU tokens have not been mentioned, they will likely be launched before the year ends. The PENGU token supply will be capped at 88,888,888,888, leading to a significant cross-chain expansion for Pudgy Penguins. The Pudgy ecosystem of NFTs will remain on Ethereum, while the PENGU will be based on Solana. This move indicates the project is committed to leveraging different networks for opportunities. PENGU tokenomics are here already According to Pudgy Penguins’ official post on X, there is clarity on tokenomics. For starters, 25.9% of the token will be shared with the Pudgy Penguins community, and 24.12% will be set aside for the other communities and new members. 17.8% of the tokens will be allocated to current and future team members, subject to a one-year cliff and three-year vesting period. The company will remain holding 11.48% under the same vesting conditions. The Pudgy ecosystem of NFTs was launched in 2021. However, it faced several hurdles, and some people gave up.

Crypto King Musk (MUSKKING), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKKING is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Crypto King Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crypto King Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Crypto King Musk launched with over $7,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crypto King Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Crypto King Musk by entering its contract address – v2jWiNpR1m8gHARdM39GosZ8muaxZpowpBgWgWTSCev – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKKING.

Stacks (STX) is making waves with its recent upgrades, despite a dip in price, while Kaspa (KAS) continues to impress with its bullish momentum and innovative tech stack. Both coins are trending among top performers, drawing attention from investors and traders alike. Meanwhile, Qubetics ($TICS) is turning heads with a presale campaign that’s smashing records, solidifying its reputation as a game-changer in the digital payments space. While Kaspa and Stacks are each carving out their niche in the crypto space, Qubetics is tackling some of the most persistent problems in crypto. With its non-custodial, multi-chain wallet and a suite of innovative features, Qubetics is simplifying how people use and manage digital assets. Currently in Presale Phase 12, Qubetics has raised $5.5M from over 8,400 holders, and the momentum isn’t slowing down. Let’s dive into why these three projects deserve a spot on your watchlist for the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Qubetics ($TICS): A Giant Leap for Crypto Payments Qubetics is here to shake up how we handle digital payments. At the heart of the project is its non-custodial, multi-chain wallet, designed to make crypto transactions as simple as swiping a card . Whether you’re a die-hard Apple Pay user or swear by Google Pay, Qubetics has you covered. Here’s the real kicker: Qubetics integrates a smart contract conversion mechanism that automatically converts crypto to fiat at the point of sale . This feature is a game-changer for businesses and consumers alike. Say goodbye to price volatility and complicated conversions. Imagine you’re at a local café that only accepts USD, but you want to pay in Bitcoin. Qubetics handles the conversion instantly, so your coffee gets paid for without any extra steps. Take Sarah, for instance. She runs a boutique and loves that Qubetics ensures her customers can pay with any crypto while she receives her earnings in dollars, free of market swings. Or think about Jake, a freelance designer working with clients across the globe. He uses Qubetics to get paid quickly without dealing with wire transfer fees or delays. Currently, $TICS is priced at $0.0311, with a 10% price increase set to kick in soon. With over 305M tokens sold, investors are eyeing the post-presale price of $0.25, offering a jaw-dropping 900% ROI. If you’re looking for a crypto project with real-world utility and explosive growth potential, Qubetics should be your top pick. Stacks (STX): Building on Bitcoin’s Foundation Stacks (STX) is taking Bitcoin to the next level by enabling smart contracts and decentralized apps (dApps) on its blockchain. This innovation adds layers of functionality to Bitcoin’s rock-solid foundation, making it more than just a store of value. The recent Nakamoto Upgrade is a big deal. It decouples Stacks’ block production from Bitcoin’s block times, making transactions faster and more scalable. This upgrade couldn’t have come at a better time, as demand for efficient blockchain networks continues to grow. However, despite the tech advancements, STX’s price has faced challenges recently, mirroring broader market trends. Let’s take Emma as an example. She’s a digital artist using a Stacks-powered dApp to sell her NFTs. The upgrade means her transactions are faster, and she gets paid almost instantly. Meanwhile, large corporations are tapping into Stacks’ smart contracts to automate supply chains, cutting costs and boosting efficiency. While short-term volatility might worry some investors, Stacks’ long-term potential makes it one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. With the Nakamoto Upgrade setting the stage for broader adoption, STX could be poised for a major comeback. Kaspa (KAS): The Underdog Turned Contender Kaspa has been quietly gaining momentum and is now stepping into the spotlight. Known for its blockDAG architecture, Kaspa offers faster and more secure transactions, solving scalability issues that plague many other cryptocurrencies. Recently, Kaspa’s price surged, fueled by growing adoption and a bullish sentiment in the market. According to a recent analysis, KAS has the potential to climb even higher in 2024, supported by its strong fundamentals. The community is buzzing about Kaspa’s innovative approach to blockchain, which prioritizes speed and efficiency without compromising decentralization. Think about Alex, a developer who’s been frustrated with slow transaction times on other networks. Kaspa’s tech allows him to build apps that process transactions in seconds, creating a better experience for users. Meanwhile, traders are loving Kaspa’s price action, with many predicting it could break new all-time highs in the coming months. If you’re on the hunt for an up-and-coming project with solid tech and a passionate community, Kaspa deserves a spot in your portfolio. Its unique approach to scalability and security makes it one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Your December 2024 Crypto Watchlist To wrap it up, all three projects—Qubetics ($TICS), Stacks (STX), and Kaspa (KAS)—bring something unique to the table. Qubetics is revolutionizing how we use crypto for everyday transactions, while Stacks is enhancing Bitcoin’s capabilities with smart contracts. Kaspa, on the other hand, is tackling scalability issues with its cutting-edge blockDAG architecture. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics ($TICS), Stacks (STX), and Kaspa (KAS) as the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 . Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a crypto newbie, these projects have the potential to deliver massive returns. Don’t wait—this could be your ticket to the next big bull run!

Here’s Why Qubetics Could Be Your Ticket to the Next Big Crypto Jackpot!,"Ethereum has been making headlines yet again. As the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, Ethereum has proven it’s more than just a cryptocurrency—it’s a movement. With its continuous upgrades, expanding ecosystem, and adoption by big players, it’s no surprise Ethereum has cemented its place as a giant in the crypto world. But let’s be real: if you didn’t jump on the Ethereum train early, those massive gains feel like a distant dream. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a revolutionary project that’s turning heads with its presale success and unique focus on Real World Asset Tokenisation (RWA). While Ethereum paved the way for decentralized apps and smart contracts, Qubetics is stepping up to solve real-world problems, creating opportunities for both crypto enthusiasts and everyday people. Let’s dive into why Qubetics is shaping up to be the best crypto to buy in December 2024. Qubetics ($TICS): Your Second Chance at Crypto Gold Missed the Ethereum craze? No sweat. Qubetics is here to give you another shot at life-changing gains. As the world’s first web3 aggregator, Qubetics isn’t just riding the crypto wave—it’s making waves of its own. Focused on bridging the gap between the digital and physical worlds, Qubetics enables users to tokenise real-world assets. Imagine transforming your property, artwork, or intellectual property into blockchain-based tokens. It’s not just innovative; it’s a game-changer. Here’s the exciting part: Qubetics is currently in Presale Phase 12, with $TICS tokens priced at just $0.0311. Over 305 million tokens have already been sold, and the presale has raised a whopping $5.5 million. With over 8,400 holders on board, the buzz around Qubetics is impossible to ignore. And with each phase increasing the token price by 10%, this is the moment to act. By the time the presale ends, $TICS is projected to hit $0.25, offering early investors a staggering 900% ROI. But Qubetics isn’t just about numbers. It’s about impact. Whether you’re a small business owner tokenising assets for funding or an artist selling digital creations globally, Qubetics provides the tools to make it happen. It’s not just another crypto project—it’s a solution for the real world. Ethereum: The Trailblazer There’s no denying Ethereum’s place in the crypto hall of fame. Known for its smart contracts and decentralized applications, Ethereum revolutionized the blockchain world when it launched in 2015. It introduced a whole new way of thinking about cryptocurrency—not just as a store of value, but as a programmable network. Ethereum’s journey hasn’t been without challenges, from high gas fees to network congestion. However, its recent transition to Ethereum 2.0 has been a game-changer, improving scalability and reducing energy consumption. Ethereum remains the go-to platform for developers, with countless projects building on its robust infrastructure. But here’s the catch: much like Bitcoin, Ethereum’s early days of astronomical returns are behind us. While it remains a strong investment for those seeking stability, the kind of explosive growth that made millionaires overnight is harder to come by. For investors looking for the next Ethereum-sized opportunity, it’s time to look elsewhere. Why Qubetics Offers What Ethereum Once Did Remember when Ethereum was the new kid on the block, promising transformative technology and massive returns? That’s exactly where Qubetics is right now. Just like Ethereum disrupted the way we think about crypto, Qubetics is doing the same by tokenising real-world assets. Here’s the kicker: while Ethereum’s ecosystem is vast, its primary focus is on digital applications. Qubetics, on the other hand, is grounded in real-world utility. It’s not just for developers or tech enthusiasts—it’s for everyone. From entrepreneurs raising capital to artists protecting their creations, Qubetics is opening doors that Ethereum never could. And let’s not forget the presale advantage. Ethereum’s early adopters reaped the rewards, but most of us missed that boat. With Qubetics, you’re getting in at the ground floor, with massive growth potential still ahead. Analysts predict $TICS could climb well beyond its post-presale price, making it the best crypto to buy in December 2024 for anyone chasing significant returns. Real-Life Scenarios: How Qubetics Makes an Impact Let’s put it into perspective. Imagine a struggling small-town bookstore owner tokenising their rare collection to attract investors and keep the doors open. Or picture a freelance designer in Chicago using Qubetics to turn their portfolio into a tokenised asset, enabling them to sell rights without losing ownership. It’s not just about profits—it’s about empowerment. For businesses, professionals, and individuals alike, Qubetics offers a lifeline. It’s about taking assets that were once illiquid and turning them into opportunities. This isn’t just crypto—it’s the future of finance. And with the presale still ongoing, there’s no better time to secure your stake in this revolutionary project. Conclusion Ethereum showed us what’s possible in the world of blockchain. It built a foundation, set the standard, and changed the game. But if you missed out on its meteoric rise, you don’t have to dwell on what could’ve been. Qubetics is your chance to get in on the next big thing, a project with the potential to surpass expectations and deliver life-changing gains. With its focus on Real World Asset Tokenisation, accessible presale pricing, and incredible growth potential, Qubetics is shaping up to be the best crypto to buy in December 2024 . Don’t sit on the sidelines and watch another opportunity pass you by. Join the Qubetics presale today and be part of a revolution. The future is calling—are you ready to answer?

Take Josh, for example—a small business owner who wants to accept crypto but doesn’t want to deal with market volatility. With Qubetics, Josh gets paid in his preferred currency, hassle-free. Now imagine Clara, a digital nomad working abroad. She uses Qubetics for cross-border transactions, avoiding hefty transfer fees and long delays.

Zignaly’s social investing platform allows users to follow expert traders and copy their strategies—a huge win for newbies who don’t have time to deep-dive into charts. But what’s the real kicker? Zignaly’s profit-sharing model means you only pay a fee if your chosen trader earns you money. That’s transparency and accountability rolled into one! This month, Zignaly has been ramping up with new features aimed at enhancing user experience and expanding its reach. Imagine this: Lisa is a college student dabbling in crypto.

As its user base grows and its ZIG token gains more utility, this one’s worth watching closely. Stacks (STX): Unlocking Bitcoin’s Potential While Bitcoin is the granddaddy of crypto, it’s not exactly known for its flexibility. That’s where Stacks comes in. Built on the Bitcoin network, Stacks uses smart contracts and decentralized apps (dApps) to bring new functionality to the OG blockchain. The big news? Stacks recently rolled out the Nakamoto Upgrade, which reduces transaction times and boosts scalability. This upgrade is a game-changer, making Stacks faster and more efficient. However, the price of STX has faced headwinds recently, partly due to market-wide corrections and competition in the Layer-2 space. Take Emma, a digital artist who’s started selling her NFTs on a Stacks-powered dApp. She loves how the platform lets her keep full control of her work and earn royalties automatically. Meanwhile, businesses are exploring Stacks’s smart contracts to streamline supply chains and other operations. Despite its current challenges, Stacks’s tech advancements make it one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, especially for those who believe in Bitcoin’s long-term dominance. If Stacks can overcome short-term market hurdles, its future looks bright. Your Move, Crypto Investor So, what’s the takeaway? Qubetics ($TICS) is a trailblazer, turning crypto payments into something even your grandma could use. Zignaly (ZIG) is empowering regular folks to grow their wealth with minimal effort.

After a sharp price decline, SOL found support at $205.5 and resumed its upward trajectory. It is poised to continue its upward momentum in the coming days. Solana (SOL) Bullish On-chain Metrics The on-chain metrics, trading volumes, and traders’ rising interest in the altcoin indicate that SOL is poised for short-term upside momentum. According to the on-chain analytics firm DefiLlama, traders’ interest and liquidity in the SOL chain appear to be rising. Data shows that SOL’s daily trading volume has skyrocketed from $2.91 billion on December 7, 2024, to $6 billion on December 11, 2024, reaching its highest level since November 2024. Additionally, Coinglass’s SOL Long/Short ratio has reached its highest level since the beginning of November 2024. Although it currently stands at 1.05, this notable rise in the long/short ratio indicates strong bullish sentiment among traders. When combining these on-chain metrics, it appears that bulls are back and continue to dominate the asset, supporting the upcoming rally. SOL Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to the expert technical analysis, SOL appears bullish as it has successfully retested the crucial support level of $205. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action and historical momentum, the SOL rally could continue if it breaks through the resistance level at $240. If SOL breaks through this level and closes a daily candle above $241, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 10% to reach $269 in the coming days. At press time, SOL is trading near $227 and has registered a price surge of over 7% in the past 24 hours.

Cornerstone Of A Financial Revolution Eric believes that Bitcoin being traded at $1 million per coin may happen soon, describing the crypto as the “cornerstone of a financial revolution.” COMMENT: Eric Trump is confident that Bitcoin will hit $1M. https://t.co/iFb5cmzpFz — BSCN (@BSCNews) December 10, 2024 Trump’s son made the fearless forecast as he talked to the attendees of the Bitcoin MENA 2024 conference in Abu Dhabi on December 9, delivering his prediction to the audience without any taint of doubt on the capability of Bitcoin to hit that milestone. “I can tell you a hell of a lot more eyes are going to be opened when Bitcoin hits $1 million. And I’m confident it’s going to hit $1 million. I think we’re all confident in this room that it’s going to hit a million,” Eric stated. According to Eric, he sees Bitcoin as a “global asset”, pointing out the global significance of the crypto in a time wherein the threat of inflation, political instability, and natural disasters is rampant. For the Trump Organization’s vice president, the future of finance is Bitcoin, arguing that the crypto is a powerful hedge against the traditional financial system’s inefficiencies because of its decentralized quality and fixed supply of 21 million coins. “Bitcoin eliminates the need for tens of thousands of bankers pushing paperwork for exorbitant fees,” he added. More Accessible Financial Tool Eric noted that what makes Bitcoin successful as a global asset is its accessibility, adding that crypto does not need intermediaries such as banks or brokers in its transactions. Trump’s son stressed the global appeal of cryptocurrency and how user-friendly is the digital asset as compared to traditional real estate investments. “Unlike real estate, Bitcoin is not tied to geography. It’s global, instantly liquid. You can buy or sell it while having dinner with your spouse,” Eric explained. Moreover, Eric emphasized that Bitcoin could empower people in developing nations. “Bitcoin gives everybody the opportunity around the world to participate in ways they never otherwise would have thought, no matter their wealth, no matter their location,” he remarked.

Crypto strategist Ali Martinez tells his 97,000 followers on the social media platform X that DOGE appears to be in the phase of the cycle when it pauses before skyrocketing to new record highs. The trader shares a chart suggesting that DOGE is mirroring its price action during the 2017 and 2021 market cycles while trading in a large ascending channel. “Check out where we are in the Dogecoin DOGE bull cycle! Very early, right? For that reason, I’m thankful for the dip and will buy more between $0.40-$0.30. The target remains $3, and if things go wild, $18!” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, DOGE is trading for $0.391, down nearly 5% on the day. Turning to the layer-1 protocol Cardano ( ADA ), Martinez says that the altcoin can find support at the $1 level based on the In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) metric. IOMAP classifies crypto addresses as either profiting, breaking even, or losing money – to determine support and resistance levels for ADA. According to the metric, 41,720 addresses have accumulated over one billion ADA at $1. Source: Ali Martinez/X Zooming out, Martinez says Cardano appears to be following its 2020 price action when it witnessed a period of retracement before soaring to fresh highs. “Cardano is doing the same as it did in 2020, which is why I’m buying! Even if it dips down to $0.76, I’m buying more and plan to book profits between $4 and $6.” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, ADA is trading at $1.

Pepe MAGA (PEPEMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe MAGA by entering its contract address – C3zan7DDUAxZDSLnSxpptmyARsvGAbah4KWQB5QokoFM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEMAGA.

If you missed the FLOKI Inu hype train back in the day, here’s your shot at redemption. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is not just another meme coin; it’s attracting the bulls with its lucrative presale, already raising over $3.4 million and selling more than 50 billion coins to over 4,400 holders. At just $0.00012 in its 11th presale stage, BTFD promises massive gains for early investors. But why is BTFD creating such a buzz? For starters, it’s all about turning market dips into opportunities. With features like staking, a P2E game, and an incredibly loyal Bulls Squad community, BTFD is carving its place in the meme coin hall of fame. Let’s dive into why BTFD is set to dethrone FLOKI as the meme coin to watch. BTFD Coin: The Rise of the Dip-Seizing Movement The phrase “Buy the F***ing Dip” (BTFD) is a rallying cry in the crypto world, and BTFD Coin embodies this ethos like no other. Born from the concept of turning price dips into opportunities, BTFD Coin is designed for savvy investors who want to grab low-priced coins before the next market surge. The presale started at $0.000004 and has already climbed to $0.00012, showing an 11th-stage presale momentum that’s hard to ignore. With a total supply of 173 billion coins, BTFD is primed for scarcity-driven price growth. Imagine investing $1,800 today at $0.00012 per coin. You’d snag 15 million coins. By the time the coin hits its listing price of $0.0006, your investment will be worth $9,000. That’s a 400% gain without even factoring in potential bull-run profits. BTFD isn’t just about flipping coins; it’s about community and innovation. The Bulls Squad—a core group of crypto enthusiasts—drives engagement through memes, market insights, and community support. Plus, the BTFD Play-to-Earn (P2E) game’s beta version is live. While rewards aren’t active yet, players are raving about the immersive experience and potential for future earnings. Staking is another big draw. With an average APY of 90%, BTFD rewards holders who play the long game. Stake $10,000 BTFD, and in a year, you could see your holdings nearly double. Combine that with the upcoming listing on major exchanges, and it’s clear why analysts are bullish on BTFD hitting $0.002 by late 2025. How to Buy BTFD The presale process is straightforward. For $1 USDT, you can grab 8,341 BTFD coins. If you’re holding Ethereum, Bitcoin, Binance Coin, or Solana, you’re in luck. Just one Ethereum gets you 30,507,083 BTFD coins, while a single Bitcoin lands you over 813 million coins . The entry points are accessible, and the rewards are potentially massive. With over $3.4 million raised so far and only a few presale stages left, now’s the time to act. Don’t let FOMO keep you from securing your stake in the Best Ongoing Meme Coin Presale. FLOKI Inu: The Meme Coin You Wish You Hadn’t Missed FLOKI Inu emerged in 2021 as part of the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu-inspired meme coin frenzy. Named after Elon Musk’s pet Shiba Inu, FLOKI combined the power of internet culture with a solid community-driven approach. Early adopters saw astronomical returns, with FLOKI’s price skyrocketing by over 10,000% in its initial run. FLOKI’s roadmap has been anything but ordinary. From launching FlokiFi, its DeFi ecosystem, to developing Valhalla, a blockchain-based metaverse game, FLOKI has consistently delivered on its promises. Today, it’s trading at $0.00003456, boasting a market cap of $325 million. While the price may seem small, the returns for early investors were anything but. A modest $100 investment during FLOKI’s infancy could’ve turned into a small fortune. But as they say, hindsight is 20/20. Despite its success, FLOKI hasn’t been without challenges. The crypto market’s volatility and competition from newer meme coins have tempered its growth. Still, FLOKI remains a strong contender in the meme coin space, particularly with its push into NFTs and metaverse gaming. Why BTFD Could Be the Best Overall While FLOKI has already established itself, BTFD is just getting started. Its presale price offers incredible upside, and the project’s innovative features —from staking to its P2E game—are already generating buzz. With FLOKI, the ship might’ve sailed for 1,000x returns, but with BTFD, the journey is just beginning. The Verdict: Don’t Miss Out Again Cryptocurrency is about timing, and if FLOKI taught us anything, it’s that early birds truly get the worm. BTFD Coin’s presale is shaping up to be the Best Ongoing Meme Coin Presale of 2024, with analysts predicting explosive growth. Whether you’re looking to play the P2E game, stake your coins for long-term rewards, or simply ride the next meme coin wave, BTFD has something for everyone. Don’t let this opportunity slip through your fingers. Sign up today and secure your stake before the presale ends. Your financial future might just thank you.

Inspired by the animated Netflix series Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix, the game will debut on Arbitrum. Ubisoft, known for publishing popular franchises like Assassin’s Creed and Just Dance, has featured a cast of characters from its previous titles, including Far Cry: Rayman, Assassin’s Creed, Blood Dragon, Beyond Good and Evil, The Crew, Rainbow Six, Splinter Cell, and Watch Dogs. Ubisoft has a free NFT mint for the game While gamers await the launch in a week, a free NFT mint is happening today. Niji Warrior, the games’ NFT collection, is launching today on the Magic Eden Marketplace . The NFT allows holders to make inputs into game mechanics, map designs, and storylines. Holders of these tokens will have access to exclusive perks and the leeway to participate in community governance. They could also evolve their NFTs based on how deeply they engage. Ubisoft’s Technical Director and Executive Producer, Didier Genevois, spoke on the project: This project represents a new frontier in collaborative game development, where players become co-creators. ~ Didier Genevois All the 10,000 Niji warrior NFTs portray a pixel of a robot or creature. The art is similar to the artwork for Warlords NFTs, released earlier by Ubisoft’s Champions Tactics last year. Web3 gaming continues to gain momentum The Web3 gaming space has taken an upward trajectory, and there are signs that it’s not stopping anytime soon.

37523458,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=660636,1733961652,XRP Price Prediction: Last Phase Of ABC Wave Points To A Bounce To New ATH At $5.85,"Crypto analyst Dark Defender has revealed a target to watch out for as the XRP price targets a new all-time high (ATH). The analyst made this prediction based on his wave analysis, which showed that XRP is still bullish. XRP Price To Hit New ATH At $5.85 In an X post, Dark Defender predicted that the XRP price could reach a new ATH of $5.85 based on his ABC wave analysis. The analyst stated that XRP set the ABC wave when the crypto was at Wave A. He further noted that XRP has bounced back from the $1.88 support level. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Prediction: Here’s What The 91-Day Pattern Says Could Happen Next With this development, the analyst is confident that the XRP price rally to $5.85 has begun. The analyst recently revealed that a bull flag appeared on XRP’s weekly chart, which showed that the crypto could reach as high as $11 by early 2025. Based on his Elliot Wave theory, the analyst had also previously predicted that the XRP market top could be around $18. In the meantime, the goal is for the XRP price to surpass its current ATH of $3.80 and reach $5.85, as Dark Defender has predicted. XRP has witnessed a price correction following its parabolic rally of over 200% last month. However, the crypto looks well primed for its next leg up. From a fundamental perspective, the XRP price boasts a bullish outlook, especially following New York’s approval of the RLUSD stablecoin. Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed that exchange and partner listings are set to follow and that RLUSD will launch soon. This development caused the price to experience a significant bounce. Meanwhile, crypto analyst TheXRPguy listed the RLUSD launch as one of the events that market participants wait for before they consider selling their coins. The stablecoin launch would inject more liquidity into the XRP ecosystem, which could spark a significant surge in the XRP price. The Stars Are Aligning For XRP In an X post, crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto said that the stars are aligning for a massive bull run for the XRP price. He made this statement while alluding to the fact that experts predict that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could dismiss its appeal against Ripple when the new administration comes in. Related Reading: This Analyst Correctly Predicted The Bitcoin Flash Crash To $94,000, But There’s A New Target He noted that the SEC lawsuit is the last “lone cloud” lingering above the XRP community. As such, dismissing the appeal could boost investors’ confidence in the crypto, providing a bullish outlook for the XRP price. CrediBULL Crypto suggested that XRP could reach as high as $10 in this bull run while stating that there should be more than one wave of upside remaining. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.34, up over 8% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The transaction was executed by swapping approximately $5 million in USDC for ETH. This move has sparked discussions and speculation about Trump's interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly Ethereum, amidst his son Eric Trump's vocal support for Bitcoin at the Bitcoin MENA 2024 conference in Abu Dhabi. Eric Trump has predicted that his father will be the 'crypto president,' positioning the U.S. as the global 'crypto capital' and forecasting Bitcoin to reach $1 million.
