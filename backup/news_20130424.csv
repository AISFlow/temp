42397145,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYtK6,1366822413,"Volatile bitcoin has limited usefulness, profs say","Bitcoin's value is likely to remain volatile, which will limit the digital currency's usefulness, according to a select group of economics professors across the US.  The IGM Economic Experts Panel -- 38 academics from Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Princeton, the University of Chicago, the University of California-Berkeley and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology -- tackles a different public policy issue in a weekly email poll. In this latest poll, they were asked the following question about bitcoin:  ""A bitcoin's value derives solely from the belief that others will want to use it for trade, which implies that its purchasing power is likely to fluctuate over time to a degree that will limit its usefulness.""  A full 61 percent of the panelists said they agreed with the statement, while 18 percent responded that they ""strongly agreed"". Only 5 percent disagreed. The rest were uncertain or expressed no opinion.  ""It is already trading like a speculative asset and (there is) no reason why that will cease,"" replied Anil Kashyap, professor of economics and finance at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Kashyap noted that most successful forms of money have some baseline value because of government sponsorship or some other intrinsic value:  ""Federal Reserve notes can be used to pay taxes, which is useful and the government tries to responsibly control the supply,"" he said. ""Gold has other uses besides serving as money.""  Kashyap -- who ranked the confidence of his response as a ""7"" on the poll's scale of 1 to 10 -- added, ""Bitcoins exist in a vacuum; they only have value because you assume when you get one, you can pass it along to someone else and the supply is uncertain. So their value is more like a painting than traditional money: if they fall out of favor there is nothing that stops them from losing a high fraction of their value.""  In the poll itself, fellow Chicago professor Austan Goolsbee was even more confident (ranking his ""strongly agree"" response as a ""10"") and succinct. His response? ""Hahahaha. ROTFL.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Doug Watt,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/04/24/volatile-bitcoin-has-limited-usefulness-profs-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397148,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYtN3,1366821854,'Shock and awe' DDoS campaign does neither,"A much-hyped distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on several bitcoin exchanges failed to materialize this week.  A post (since deleted) on the text-sharing site Pastebin.com over the weekend had promised a massive attack on the bitcoin infrastructure for Monday, April 22. The stated goal was to bring the price of bitcoin down to $30 (US).  The promised attack, set to start at 15:30 UTC, was to involve the distribution of bogus press releases suggesting that the bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox was under investigation for securities fraud. Shortly afterward, the story was to be spammed on Reddit and updated with fake accounts.  ""Several sellers lined up for a co-ordinated dump of 250,000+ BTC which will crash the price to under 100 to correlate in time with publication of bogus AP reports,"" the attack blueprint stated. The dump was to be followed by a massive DDoS attack on nine major exchanges, including Mt. Gox.  The attacker(s) then promised to buy bitcoins from the Bitstamp exchange, which would be spared a DDoS attack, but would have been used earlier to dump bitcoins.  ""You all know your stations, distribute this paste to the rest of the group as it won't last long on the hidden wiki,"" the text concluded. ""Don't let this get out to the public, we need the price to remain high at 120 leading up to the event for maximum effect.""  There were few reports of any extraordinary DDoS activity on Monday, and the price didn't fall anywhere close to $30. In fact, Mt. Gox pricing finished slightly up on the day, at $127.50.  ""It was a troll to begin with,"" Mikko Hyponnen, chief research officer at the security software company F-Secure, told CoinDesk. ""I don't think there was any attack at all.""  Prior to the promised attack, Hyponnen had tweeted:    ""Troll: 'Operation Shock And Awe … Goal: Bring bitcoin price < $30 US dollars … '      ""pastebin.com/raw.php?i=QAPx…    ""pastebin.com/raw.php?i=xetD…    ""#DistributedF5    ""    Perhaps coincidentally, the AP news service's Twitter account was hacked the following day (April 23) and used to post a fake story about bombs exploding at the White House. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted by around 3 percent in value in just minutes before rebounding, and someone clearly made money from it. This was a rare case in which a regulated market suffered from a hack, while an unregulated, volatile one remained largely unaffected.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/04/24/shock-and-awe-ddos-campaign-does-neither,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42397150,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYtP1,1366817356,Butterfly Labs' Jalapeno aims to spice up bitcoin mining,"The ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) wars are heating up. Butterfly Labs -- the US-based company that has been promising a low-powered, low-cost ASIC mining rig for months now -- has finally shipped one to a US blogger and bitcoin specialist.  David Perry, who owns the technology blog Coding in My Sleep, took delivery of a Jalapeno ASIC mining rig from Butterfly Labs on April 20, and filmed an ""un-boxing"" video, along with a short review.  Perry measured the unit hashing at 5 Ghashes/sec, with an energy consumption rate of 30 watts when working ... which is in line with Butterfly's specifications. The rig sucks up 13 watts when idle.  Perry, who had seen some initial designs for the Butterfly kit (he's known to the company as an active bitcoiner), says the initial specs for the Jalapeno called for a small, USB-powered device with a 2.5-watt load. The rig released this month, however, not only has a higher power load but comes with both a USB cable and its own power brick.  Perry says he was disappointed the device was larger than originally envisioned. (Butterfly Labs had initially promised something the size of a cup warmer, he says.)  Competing ASIC rig vendor Avalon, which offers its units on a per-batch basis and is in between batches right now, offers 60 Ghashes/sec with its device, which is the size of a desktop PC. Getting the same output with Butterfly's rig would require bolting 12 of the 5 Ghash/sec Jalapenos together ... which still makes the Butterfly unit a little more compact, although far from svelte.  What makes the Butterfly Labs unit more power efficient than Avalon's?  ""The primary difference is the nm (nanometer) process of the chips,"" Perry tells CoinDesk. ""The transistors in Avalon's chips are about twice the size of the ones on Butterfly Labs', which makes the device larger and causes it to consume more electricity and put off more heat.""  Perry's early delivery was a one-off. Butterfly Labs says on its site that the ASIC mining units won't be shipping until later in April 2013, and orders will be processed on a first-come, first served basis. There is already a queue, and the firm predicts wait times of up to two months. (Butterfly Labs did not respond to several requests for comment early this week.)  This makes the hardware payback difficult to predict. At a BTC/USD exchange rate of $130, the 5, 25 and 50 Ghash/sec options on Butterfly Lab's website all offer roughly the same payback period of around seven t0 eight days (you can do the calculations yourself here or here). But who knows where the volatile currency will stand eight to 10 weeks from now?  ""If I knew in January that it would (be) end of April and still no jalapeno, I wouldn't have bought one,"" said one impatient Butterfly Labs customer on the IRC chat for the BTC Guild mining pool. ""Live and learn, I'll only order an ASIC now from someone that has them shipping.""  The customer added, ""If i had just bought a gpu with that $175, I would have mined 3+ btc by now with it, rather than having nothing to show for it other than promises of delivery.""  Assuming he had a Radeon 7970, he's right (we checked). At today's BTC/USC rate, that device's payback is around 99 days at today's rates, even though the Radeon costs approximately $120 more than a 5 Ghash/sec Jalapeno. So the question is: do you want your mining rig now, or do you want it later, but better?  There could be a comfortable middle ground: Avalon accepted trade-ins on FPGA mining gear for its second ASIC batch. If it continues that policy, you could buy into the mining game with what's available now, and then upgrade later while minimizing your capital loss.  Unlike some  , Perry doesn't think that ASICs will replace GPUs:  ""I don't see GPU mining dying off, I see it migrating to Litecoin,"" he says. ""I think FPGA may eventually fall off, but probably not from this generation of ASICs.""  While he waits to see if that pans out, he's mining himself a nice little collection of bitcoins.
