In a statement Tuesday, Linda Lacewell, the newly appointed superintendent, announced the Research and Innovation Division at the Department of Financial Services will track emerging financial technologies and be ""responsible for licensing and supervising virtual currencies.""  This will include licensing approvals made under the state’s BitLicense, a regulatory regime that governs firms buying, selling or issuing cryptocurrencies to consumers in the state, the agency affirmed in a follow-up request for comment.  ""This division will oversee the virtual currency licensing process and will encourage development in the area,"" the NYDFS said.  Lacewell's predecessor, Maria T. Vullo, opposed regulatory experimentation for non-banking financial firms when leading the agency, marking this research and innovation division as a reprieve from the regulator's formerly heavy hand.  Lacewell said:  “The financial services regulatory landscape needs to evolve and adapt as innovation in banking, insurance and regulatory technology continues to grow.""  The NYDFS has been regulating companies in the crypto space in 2015, when its BitLicense program came into effect. The regime has been attacked by industry entrepreneurs including ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees, who once said: ""Here we are two miles from the Statue of Liberty and you cannot sell CryptoKitties in the state without that license. That’s the absurdity of what’s happened here.""  The agency reportedly only granted eight BitLicenses in the first three years following its implementation. Currently over 20 licenses have been granted to cryptocurrency firms.  Lacewell most recently approved two subsidiaries of the crypto exchange Seed CX to operate in the state under the BitLicense framework.  Named executives  Four executives were named in the announcement, all with backgrounds in governmental work.  At the helm of the organization is executive deputy superintendent Matthew Homer, who most recently worked at fintech startup Plaid.  The current director of research, Olivia Bumgardner, will also join the division as deputy superintendent. In her tenure at the state’s financial watchdog, Bumgardner has led initiatives involving digital assets and cybersecurity. Matthew Siegel, attorney in the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, will serve as a deputy superintendent, and Andrew Lucas, director for the Office of Financial Innovation, will serve as counsel.  Speaking to the appointments, Lacewell said:  “This new division and these appointments position DFS as the regulator of the future, allowing the Department to better protect consumers, develop best practices, and analyze market data to strengthen New York’s standing as the center of financial innovation.""

42403107,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdefzV,1563897611,South Korean Financial Overseer Who Banned ICOs Abruptly Quits,"The head of South Korea's Financial Services Commission (FSC) abruptly resigned last week, according to a July 18 report from The Korea Times.  Former Chairman Choi Jong-ku reportedly left his office one day in advance of his second anniversary, amid a period of governmental reorganization.  He told reporters he resigned ""before the expected reshuffle"" to ""widen the scope"" of President Moon Jae-in's search for new cabinet members. Choi’s predecessors have typically resigned at the two-year mark under similar circumstances.  The top candidates to replace Choi as chairman include Eun Sung-soo, who took over as CEO for Korea’s Export-Import Bank when Choi abdicated the post in 2017. Yoon Jong-won, former Blue House secretary in Korea’s executive branch, and Kim Yong-beom, former FSC vice chairman, among others, are also being considered.  During his tenure, Choi navigated conflicting cryptocurrency proposals issued by various financial regulators, but came down hard against the ICO boom. In March 2018, he called the speculative investments ""irrational,"" when working with Chinese and Japanese financial authorities to ban the investment vehicle.  He added:  “[A] fever of speculative investment in cryptocurrencies is ongoing … however, cryptocurrencies are unable to play a role as a means of payment.”  Despite this hard line approach to ICOs and cryptocurrency, Choi enacted what is seen by some as favorable legislation towards small and medium sized blockchain businesses.

42403104,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdefyW,1563893125,Bitfinex Investor Raising $21 Million for Binance-Style Exchange Cryptocurrency,"RenrenBit, a China-based crypto peer-to-peer lending and wallet startup founded by well-known over-the-counter (OTC) trader Dong Zhao, has lined up commitments worth $21 million for its own token sale.  The lending platform kicked off the sale of 21 million RRB tokens on Monday, each priced at 1 USDT, the dollar-pegged cryptocurrency issued by Tether. It's yet another example of a notable Chinese crypto startup capitalizing on the craze of exchange platform tokens following the significant growth of Binance's BNB.  According to a notice posted on RenrenBit's mobile app, the sale was fully subscribed within about four hours with all 21 million RRB spoken for. The firm allows a two-day window for investors who might have second thoughts to withdraw their orders so the eventual amount raised could vary.  According to the white paper, RRB is an ERC-20 token that runs on top of ethereum and can be used to offset transaction fees for crypto-to-crypto and OTC trading on RenrenBit. It can also be pledged as collateral for the platform's crypto lending services. The firm said the token would initially be tradable on its own app.  The 21 million tokens in the public sale account for half of the total issuance. The other half will be held by RenrenBit's team, of which 2.1 million will be unlocked initially and available for trading.  Based on an ethereum address screenshot provided by Zhao, one of the company's ethereum wallets saw some $19 million worth of ERC 20-based USDT flocking in over the weekend. Prospective investors would first need to deposit at least 1,000 USDT into their RenrenBit account to prove eligibility.  Ordinary users with at least 1,000 USDT on RenrenBit were able to buy up to 1,000 RRB, while others with higher net worth investors could buy as much as 75,000 RRB.  Fresh funding  The sale came just after RenrenBit revealed its $3 million Series A round led by notable VCs such as Dragonfly Capital and Zhao's DFund, as well as crypto exchange Bitfinex, of which Zhao is a shareholder. He said in RenrenBit's official Telegram channel that the round valued the firm at $16 million.  Some users questioned the legality of RenrenBit's token sale in China, as the country's central bank notably banned initial coin offerings (ICOs) and token fundraising in 2017.  Zhao responded in the Telegram channel:  ""RenrenBit held talks with the financial regulators and the central bank as early as January this year. We are clearly aware of the legal boundaries.""  However, he declined to further clarify what these boundaries are when contacted by CoinDesk.  Founded in late 2018, RenrenBit operates like a broker for lenders and borrowers who need to borrow Chinese yuan or crypto assets with other crypto assets pledged as collateral. It emerged as part of the growing landscape of crypto lending businesses in China and worldwide.  Early adopter  One of the earliest bitcoin investors in China, Zhao entered the crypto industry around 2012 with about $1.5 million after selling his earlier startup Moji, a mobile weather forecast app.  He rode the bull run in 2013 but fell into debt of over $10 million after his bitcoin futures position got forcibly liquidated when the price tanked in early 2014 following the Mt.Gox hack.  Zhao shifted to OTC trading over the past few years, the profits of which helped him accumulate capital to repay the debt.  He then founded DGroup, which runs an OTC trading desk and the cryptocurrency fund DFund.

42403115,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeg7N,1563886805,Genesis' Lending Surges Again in Q2 – and Not Just in Crypto,"Genesis Global Trading's crypto-related lending business remains on a growth tear – especially its loans of U.S. dollars and blockchain substitutes.  According to statistics published by the over-the-counter trading firm Tuesday, Genesis' ""cash"" lending doubled in the second quarter from the previous quarter to about $186 million. These loans, denominated in fiat or the dollar-pegged USDC, PAX, TrueUSD or USDT stablecoins, were introduced in last year's fourth quarter and now account for 23.5 percent of the firm's outstanding loans.  Tellingly, the majority of these loans were written in June, when bitcoin’s price climbed to nearly $14,000.  Two forces converged to make fiat an attractive borrowing option in a bull market, Genesis CEO Michael Moro told CoinDesk.  First was the forward price curve exceeding the spot price of bitcoin as the market turned bullish. Moro said investors responded to the phenomenon by pledging their bitcoin as collateral to borrow cash to buy more bitcoin – capturing the spread between the forward and spot markets.  Second is the growing global demand for dollars. Where firms were once stymied by a lack of access to U.S. bank accounts, they can now purchase stablecoins through Genesis in a frictionless currency swap.  Record originations  All told, Genesis originated $746 million in loans in the second quarter, up 75 percent and a record for the company since it began lending in March 2018.  Genesis' outstanding loans increased 149 percent to $452 million. The majority of this portfolio, 62.5 percent, remains denominated in bitcoin.  This was the fifth straight quarter of growth for Genesis, which says it is the largest (at $2.3 billion in cumulative originations) institution-only crypto lending firm.  ""The momentum of lending has continued into the bull market,"" Moro said.  The ratio of domestic to international counterparties has shifted to around 60/40, whereas last year nearly 80 percent of borrowers were based in the US.  Moro said a second-order effect of institutions buying stablecoins is that they on-board to other cryptocurrencies. The increased institutional knowledge of opening up a wallet and learning how to trade removes the barriers to buying an unpegged digital asset such as bitcoin.  Despite the uptick in first-time borrowers in the bull market, Moro said Genesis has yet to have a loan go into default or delinquency.

Purporting to be sent from British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, the email touts a ""guaranteed chance to earn"" via cryptocurrency, FT Advisor reports Tuesday.  The message is dressed up with FCA and Bank of England logos, and sports a photo of physical cryptocurrencies – bitcoin, litecoin and XRP – over the British Union Jack flag.  A tell-tale that the email likely isn't from the FCA is that the caption for the proceed button comes with the misspelled text ""Click her"".  Dominic Thomas, founder and principal of London-based Solomon’s Independent Financial Advisers, warned the FCA of the potential scam on Twitter, saying he'd received the email multiple times in several days.    Dear @TheFCA here is an email I have now had 5 times since Friday.

It's not clear whether the message contains a virus as Thomas suspected or is a phishing attempt.  FT Advisor indicates that the FCA is now aware of the email.  The use of the regulator's branding in the scam message is perhaps ironic, as one of its tasks is to warn the British public over such schemes.  The news comes just days after one of CoinDesk's editors had his identity stolen by another suspect crypto scheme and posted on its website as a supposed ""advisor.""

42403116,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeg8M,1563879648,Bitcoin Drops Below Long-Term Price Support at $10K,"View  Bitcoin has violated the support of the trendline connecting the April and May lows, having charted a bearish lower high at $11,100 over the weekend.  A bearish volume divergence indicates prices could fall back to the July 17 low of $9,049.  Daily chart indicators are also indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside.  A UTC close above $11,100 is needed to invalidate lower highs setup on the daily chart.      Bitcoin (BTC) fell below key support above $10,000 earlier today and could suffer a deeper drop, according to price and volume analysis.  The top cryptocurrency by market value violated a trendline representing the recent four-month bull run with a move below $11,017 at 06:30 UTC and went on to a hit a low of $9,897 on Bitstamp.  With the pullback from Saturday's high of $11,140 to sub-$10,000 levels, BTC has established yet another bearish lower high – the most basic of all bearish technical patterns – on the daily chart.  As a result, the bears are expected to dominate proceedings in the short term. In fact, BTC could fall all the way back to the July 17 low of $9,097, erasing the low-volume bounce from that level to $11,120 seen in four days to July 20.  Popular cryptocurrency trader and mentor Chonis Trading took note of the bearish volume divergence on a 12-hour chart on July 21. A bearish volume divergence occurs when trading volumes drop, creating lower highs as opposed to higher lows (an uptick) on the price chart.  A low-volume lift could be referred to as a ""dead cat bounce"" – a temporary recovery caused by the unwinding of shorts (profit taking).  And the bitcoin market seems to have experienced a dead cat bounce over the last few days.  A sudden unwinding of shorts on July 19, as reported by bot-powered twitter handle @WhaleCalls, pushed prices back above $10,000. The cryptocurrency remained bid over the next two days, only to face rejection above $11,000 over the weekend amid weak trading volumes and fell back below $10,000 earlier today.  While volume analysis favors a drop to recent lows, technical indicators are also painting a short-term bearish picture.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $9,970 on Bitstamp, representing a 3.5 percent drop on the day.  Daily and 4-hour charts  The Chaikin money flow index (above left), which incorporates both prices and trading volumes, has dropped below zero for the first time since the end of April. It means BTC is facing sell pressure for the first time in nearly three months.  The 14-day relative strength index is reporting bearish conditions with a below-50 reading. Notably, the indicator failed to rise above 50.00 over the weekend, reinforcing the short-term bearish view.  So, the stage looks set for a drop to recent lows near $9,049. Note that a UTC close below the rising trendline connecting April 1 and May 29 lows would mean an end of the rally from lows near $4,000.  The outlook would turn bullish if prices invalidate the bearish lower-highs pattern on the daily chart with a UTC close above $11,120. That level could come into play if BTC sees a high-volume falling channel breakout on the 4-hour chart (above right).  A stronger confirmation of bull revival would be a weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $12,000, as discussed earlier this month.

42403097,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdefqe,1563879643,Utah County to Offer Blockchain Voting App in Municipal Elections,"Utah County is to pilot the mobile voting app from Voatz in its municipal primary election in August.  According to a press release on Tuesday, the county will offer the blockchain-based voting service to active-duty military, their eligible dependents and overseas voters. The pilot is a collaboration between the Utah County Elections Division, Voatz, Tusk Philanthropies and the National Cybersecurity Center.  As part of the Tusk Philanthropies effort to increase voter turnout, Voatz has previously been trialed in municipal elections in Denver, as well as two primaries in West Virginia – the first time a U.S. state has offered blockchain-based mobile voting in federal elections.  The pilot is primarily targeting troops serving abroad, who normally to rely on absentee paper ballots, which can prove an obstacle to voting. The press release cites the U.S. Elections Assistance Commission as saying that nearly 300,000 overseas voters had requested ballots in the 2016 elections, but had not been able to return them to the county clerks in time.  “Utah’s pilot is another sign that the momentum for mobile voting in our country is very real and supports our theory that when you show people a much better way to do something, there becomes a demand for it,” said Bradley Tusk, founder and CEO of Tusk Philanthropies. “As we enter into a Presidential election year, we have to continue to remove as many barriers and hurdles as possible so a lot more people are able to participate in our democracy.”  Voatz's mobile app is supported by ""military-grade"" security tech, as well as biometrics and blockchain infrastructure, according to the announcement. The startup has now conducted more than 40 pilots including from state party conventions and student government elections. Utah County is a jurisdiction within the U.S. state of Utah.  “The upcoming Utah County pilot will be an exciting opportunity to build off the learnings we gained in Denver,” said Forrest Senti, director of business and government initiatives at the National Security Cyber Center. “This next pilot is a great showcase of how public/private partnerships can innovate to push the envelope of what it means to have ease of access and security for all voters everywhere.”  In June, Voatz raised $7 million in funding from investors including Overstock's Medici Ventures and Techstars.

42403099,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdefsc,1563876050,Indian Panel Proposes Fines and Jail Time for Cryptocurrency Use,"A panel reporting to India's Finance Ministry suggested the country's regulators have an ""open mind"" about a governmental cryptocurrency and, at the same time, proposed fines and up to ten years in prison for general use of crypto in the country.  The panel, created by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, and the Reserve Bank of India, found that there was serious concern with the ""mushrooming of cryptocurrencies almost invariably issued abroad and numerous people in India investing in these,"" according to the report.  ""All these cryptocurrencies have been created by non-sovereigns,"" they complained.  “Therefore, the Committee is of clear view that the private cryptocurrencies should not be allowed. These cryptocurrencies cannot serve the purpose of a currency. The private cryptocurrencies are inconsistent with the essential functions of money/currency, hence private cryptocurrencies cannot replace fiat currencies. The Committee recommends that all private cryptocurrencies, except any cryptocurrency issued by the state, be banned in India. The Committee endorses the stand taken by the RBI to eliminate the interface of institutions regulated by the RBI from cryptocurrencies.”  On the other hand, they saw a cryptocurrency created by the RBI could be a boon for the country and that regulators should consider creating a sovereign cryptocurrency.  ""The Committee recommends that the RBI examine the utility of using DLT based systems for enabling faster and more secure payment infrastructure, especially for cross-border payments,” they wrote. “The Committee recommends that blockchain based systems may be considered by MEITY for building a low-cost KYC system that reduces the need for duplication of KYC requirements for individuals.”  The committee also saw value in the use of distributed ledgers in land deeds that could be ""beneficial for removing errors and frauds in land markets if the technology is implemented for maintaining land records.""    What this means in practice is unclear although these recommendations are in line with a conservative view of DLT and cryptocurrency use. Land deeds, for example, are a popular distributed use case and Medici Ventures and Patrick Byrne have been exploring the creation of these registries as a solution to civil unrest.    That said, 10 years in jail for stacking some sats sounds like a decidedly unlikely - and unfair - outcome of the committees' assessment. Perhaps Indian authorities will soon discover that crypto, like the internet, tends to route around damage.

42403109,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeg1T,1563873657,"Justin Sun Surfaces in San Francisco, Contrary to Chinese Media Reports","UPDATE (July 23, 22:00 UTC): This article has been updated several times since initial publication as new information became available.      If, as the saying goes, any publicity is good publicity, then Tuesday was a great day for Tron CEO Justin Sun.  The 28-year-old entrepreneur has been the talk of the crypto community for the last 24 hours, starting with Monday night’s announcement that a bout of kidney stones led him to postpone a long-awaited lunch with finance titan Warren Buffett.  Then came reports suggesting that the rescheduling was due to legal rather than medical problems. For a few hours, seemingly everyone on crypto Twitter believed Sun was in China, barred from leaving by the government amid accusations of lawbreaking.  But that narrative was seemingly debunked in the afternoon, when a live video broadcast showed Sun in what appeared to be a San Francisco high-rise, the Bay Bridge in the background, joking that he wished he were in Miami.  It was a roller-coaster ride befitting the volatile crypto space, where it's often hard to know what's real, even by 2019 standards.  Crossover event  Stepping back, the lunch was the prize for winning a charity auction. Sun bid $4.6 million earlier this year and seemingly intended to introduce the notoriously crypto-skeptical Buffett to a number of influential figures in the space. The Glide Foundation, which helps the homeless of San Francisco, received the money on June 5, according to Tron.  As of Monday, Sun had lined up Circle’s Jeremy Allaire, Huobi’s Chris Lee, eToro’s Yoni Assia and litecoin creator Charlie Lee to join him with the Oracle of Omaha on July 25.  The specific subjects to be discussed during the steak meal were not disclosed; however, Buffett has famously called bitcoin “rat poison squared,” and made a number of other unflattering remarks about cryptocurrencies.  Sun, himself a controversial figure, is the creator of the Tron blockchain protocol and head of its namesake foundation. He persuaded Buffett to move the charity lunch from its traditional New York location to the Bay Area.  Then, late Monday, the Tron Foundation announced the postponement, saying Sun had fallen ill with kidney stones and that the parties had “agreed to reschedule at a later date.”  Reports from China  Hours later, a Chinese business news outlet suggested that the matter might not be so straightforward.  The 21st Century Business Herald published an article accusing Sun of illegal fundraising via the Tron project. It also alleged the Tron network operated illegal gambling services accessible to Chinese residents and further took aim at Sun's early startup Peiwo, a social app, accusing it of illegal involvement in the pornography business.  The media outlet stated that it has confirmed with multiple sources that Justin Sun was inside mainland China.  ""Without a clear answer to these questions raised, will Justin be able to have this $4 million meal?"" the article asked, implying Sun may not be able to leave the country without addressing the alleged issues.  Shortly afterward, Sun responded via his Weibo account to deny the allegations made by the 21st Century Business Herald.  ""The illegal fundraise accusation is wrong. Tron complied with regulators and refunded investors on Sept. 20 in 2017, immediately after the order [of a ban on initial coin offerings] from seven ministries in China,"" Sun wrote, adding:  ""The Tron foundation is based in Singapore in compliance with local regulations and laws ... and does not involve any flow of capital, or any crypto or fiat currency onramp.""  Sun's response did not include any detail regarding his whereabouts, however, and he did not respond to CoinDesk's inquiry about his current location.  ‘Totally inaccurate’  Then came a second story out of China, this one from an outlet that is often widely cited by Western media.  Caixin, based in Beiling, reported that Sun was under Chinese government control, meaning he was not facing formal charges but was not allowed to leave the country. The article, later published in English translation, repeated some of the allegations from the earlier 21st Century Business Herald story. CoinDesk cited and linked to Caixin’s article in our coverage, as did other news outlets.  A collective groan could be heard throughout the industry.    Guys, seriously. We look ridiculous rn        — Hailey Lennon (@HaileyLennonBTC) July 23, 2019        nice job everybody        — Neeraj K. Agrawal (@NeerajKA) July 23, 2019      But according to Cliff Edwards, director of global communications at the Tron Foundation, the Caixin story was bunk.  “That report’s totally inaccurate, and we posted a photo, several photos today of Justin in San Francisco,” Edwards told CoinDesk.  Live from SF  To put the matter to rest, Sun broadcast a Periscope video, in which he panned the camera around as evidence of his location, showing off the Bay Bridge – not the Golden Gate Bridge, he noted – in the background.  “I'm not feeling quite well but I think we gonna postpone [the lunch] but definitely looking forward to it,"" Sun said, adding:  ""It's pretty comfortable in San Francisco.""  Describing Sun's current kidney stone episode, Edwards told CoinDesk, ""some moments you're in excruciating pain, some moments you're fine.”  Tronix, the native token of the Tron network, slid 11 percent Tuesday amid all the confusion. Stellar's XLM just passed it to become the 10th largest crypto by market capitalization – $1.68 billion versus $1.67 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.  Tron had scheduled Thursday's lunch with Buffett to coincide with a party to celebrate the anniversary of the company's acquisition of BitTorrent. A slate of events is still planned for Thursday, sans Buffett, Edwards confirmed.  Zack Seward contributed reporting.

42403113,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeg3R,1563872454,German Regulators Approve $280 Million Ethereum Token Sale,"Fundament, a blockchain startup coming out of stealth mode, has received the green light to issue the first tokenized real-estate backed bond that can be widely offered to individual investors.  Announced Tuesday, the Berlin-based firm has obtained approval from Germany’s financial regulator, BaFIN, for the 250 million euro ($280 million) offering. By virtue of being regulated, the token will be open to any retail investor anywhere with no minimum investment restriction.  In other words, someone in, say, Indonesia will be able to buy 100 euros worth of ethereum tokens and thereby indirectly invest in German commercial property.  A BaFin representative told Coindesk:  “We can confirm that we granted approval for a Fundament Group prospectus. It has indeed been the first time we have approved a prospectus regarding blockchain-based real estate bonds, but not the first time in respect to blockchain technology as such.”  The token, which Fundament will start marketing next month, will run on the public ethereum blockchain using the ERC-20 standard popularized by the 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) explosion.  Blockchain real estate is a busy space. Florian Glatz, co-founder of Fundament Group, said typically what has been seen in the past are private placements that have not required a prospectus or a financial market authority's approval.  In March of this year  , for instance, Inveniam Capital Partners tokenized some $260 million in four private real estate and debt transactions, starting with a WeWork-occupied building in downtown Miami, Florida.  Other examples include Templum Markets, which sold a security token representing shares in a Colorado ski resort last year, accepting U.S. dollars, bitcoin and ethereum. Beyond real estate, firms like U.K.-based Nivaura has explored tokenized debt and equity, done in a fully regulated context, allowing for trading on secondary markets.  Glatz told CoinDesk:  “The reason we went through this long tedious process with regulators was to get rid of any restrictions. Normally these projects are limited either by the minimum investment amount, which would be north of €100,000 or limited heavily in the amount of investors you could have. So it's the first really like mass-market tokenized real estate for the world.”  Compliance challenges  Fundament's token will be backed by five separate construction projects, three in Hamburg, one in Frankfurt and one in the university town of Jena. The portfolio, including residential, commercial and hotel properties, would total more than 680,000 square feet upon completion. The company projects a return on the projects in the mid-to high single digits.  “Holding a token enshrines a legal claim of the holder against the issuer of the bond to pay them an annual dividend of around 4-8 percent, and obviously once the run time of the fund is over and there is an exit, then the token holders get the complete value that was within this fund,” Glatz said.  To comply with know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) regulations, IDnow will verify prospective token buyers’ identities. The vendor's process takes three minutes on average before a user can purchase tokens, Glatz said.  Fundament will not use an investment bank but will distribute the securities itself to lower issuance costs and increase returns for investors, said Robin Matzke, another Fundament co-founder.  Buyers can pay for their tokens with bitcoin, ether, U.S. dollars or euros. For those who pay fiat, Fundament says it will deliver the tokens on a hardware device.  Fitting the project within the strictures of MiFID II – a European regulatory framework that was drafted with other things in mind – was a challenge.  “We handed in the prospectus in December 2018 and got approval last week. So it was 6 or 7 months of work,” said Matzke. “Every two or threee weeks you get 20 pages back from the regulator of things you have to change, and so on, back and forth over a period of months and it ends up being like a book. Ours has close to 100 pages.”  It would have been impossible if the founding team had not comprised so many legal as well as technical experts; in other words, they didn’t have to spend a lot on lawyers' fees because they are lawyers.  “We saved on that big time,” Matzke said.

42382373,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rSjn,1563870342,AT&T Fails to Win Dismissal in $24 Million Crypto SIM-Swap Lawsuit,"Crypto investor Michael Terpin has won an early victory in his attempt to sue telecom giant AT&T Mobility over a SIM-swapping hack that saw him lose a claimed $24 million.  In court documents published Friday, Los Angeles federal judge Otis Wright II ruled that AT&T must answer a lawsuit brought by Terpin for enabling the theft millions of dollars of cryptocurrency by giving access to his SIM card to hackers.  While the telco had requested that the court dismiss the lawsuit in its entirety, the judge decided that AT&T should answer to Terpin's claims of violation of the Federal Communications Act, breach of contract, and other legal violations.  Terpin is seeking $23.8 million in compensatory damages and a further $200 million in punitive damages.  The case was first brought in August 2018, with Terpin claiming that AT&T’s employees have been complicit in a SIM swap fraud. In this type of scam, criminals pose as the owners of a victim's mobile phone number, convincing telecom providers to grant them access to the SIM card.  Adding insult to injury, this was said to be the second time Terpin had suffered a SIM swap hack via AT&T, and he claims to have specifically told the firm that his account was high-risk and set up extra levels of security after the first incident.  In the court documents filed July 19, Judge Wright ruled that Terpin has ""sufficiently alleged that the criminal acts of a third party were reasonably foreseeable by AT&T.""  Terpin further claimed declaratory relief on the grounds that some provisions of the agreement contract with AT&T were illegal.  The judge wrote in the document:  ""He seeks to declare AT&T’s wireless customer agreement as unconscionable, void against public policy, and unenforceable in its entirety. ... Specifically, he objects to the exculpatory provision that exempts AT&T from liability from its own negligence, acts or omissions of a third party, or damages or injury caused by the use of the device; the damages restriction clause that exempts AT&T from certain forms of damages; the indemnity provision requiring customers to indemnify AT&T for claims arising out of the services provided by AT&T; and the arbitration provision requiring Mr. Terpin to arbitrate his claims.""  While the company sought dismissal on the ground that the claim was not ripe for litigation, Judge Wright said Terpin had sufficiently alleged the claim and ruled out the motion to dismiss.  However, Terpin's claim that AT&T caused him to lose $24 million in cryptocurrency came into some doubt. The judge said:  ""Based on the allegations of the Complaint, Mr. Terpin asserts that AT&T assisted the hackers with a SIM card swap, thus granting the hackers access to Mr. Terpin’s phone number. This allegedly resulted in Mr. Terpin losing $24 million in cryptocurrency. However, Mr. Terpin does not explain how the hackers accessed Mr. Terpin’s cryptocurrency account(s), whether they sold Mr. Terpin’s cryptocurrency then transferred the money, or whether they transferred the cryptocurrency to a cold wallet. At this stage, the Court is left to speculate how having access to Mr. Terpin’s phone number resulted in the theft of cryptocurrency.""  That claim was dismissed with right to amend within 21 days.  “Judge Wright strongly repudiated AT&T’s audacious bid to prevent Michael from demonstrating to a jury the carrier’s contempt for consumers’ privacy and utter disregard of its legal obligations to prevent this very type of SIM swap and financial crime,” said Terpin’s lead counsel, Pierce O’Donnell, in a press release. “The evidence will show that AT&T not once, but twice allowed hackers posing as Michael to obtain his SIM card.”  Terpin said:  “I am grateful that Judge Wright is allowing my case to proceed. We must hold AT&T accountable. If AT&T demonstrated the same zeal to totally revamp its porous security system as it does to suppress the damning evidence of its callous indifference to its customers, we would not be in court.”  Back in May, Terpin won another case brought against the perpetrator of the $24 million SIM hack.  Terpin had filed the case against 21-year-old Nicholas Truglia early this year, saying the Manhattan resident had defrauded him of cryptocurrencies after gaining control of his cellphone number. The California Superior Court ordered Truglia to pay Terpin $75.8 million in compensatory and punitive damages.

42382364,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rSXD,1563856210,Congress Drew a Fine Line Between Libra and Crypto – That's a First,"Congress might actually get crypto.  That was a key takeaway from last week’s contentious hearings in on Facebook’s Libra project in Washington, D.C.. While giving Facebook executive David Marcus the third degree, lawmakers took pains to distinguish between the social network’s project and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.  For example, Sen. Brian Schatz (D.-HI) asked Marcus to explain why Facebook specifically had to build a cryptocurrency, and not just argue what the benefits of a cryptocurrency network could be in general. Rep. Denver Riggleman (R.-VA) hammered Marcus on the security implications of using the RUST programming to implement Libra. And Rep. Warren Davidson (R.-OH) famously asked CoinShares chief strategy officer Meltem Demirors to explain the difference between bitcoin and “shitcoins.”  ""Whatever their thoughts on Facebook and Libra, they didn’t paint their thoughts of bitcoin and crypto with the same brush,"" said Omer Ozden, CEO of Rocktree Capital, a blockchain-focused merchant bank.  And while some elected officials – cough, Brad Sherman (D.-CA) – may have trotted out reliably anti-crypto tropes such as that Libra would be worse than 9/11, for the most part last week’s hearings indicated a sort of maturity about how lawmakers are approaching the space now.  Even among the members of Congress who were ""less knowledgeable"" about the space, ""I was really impressed to see they knew enough to say 'we know the hearings are separate from crypto,'"" Ozden said. ""They at least knew enough to separate that.""  It was a far cry from last year, when lawmakers called for strict regulatory protections in the crypto space, even if those calls ultimately did not result in action.  ""We've come a long way in terms of the understanding of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies in Congress,"" said Perianne Boring, founder of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, which held a blockchain education event with lawmakers the day after the second hearing.  ""It was encouraging to see that there are more members of Congress ... that are able to make that distinction between different types of products and services and applications that are available and also being able to understand they’re different,"" she said.  Taking action  The Digital Chamber’s Blockchain Education Day saw representatives from just under 120 companies in the crypto space meet with staffers or elected officials from 70 different offices in both the Senate and House of Representatives.  ""It is clear that lawmakers are aware of the great potential of this new industry,"" said Matthew Trudeau, chief strategy officer at crypto derivatives exchange ErisX. ""We were pleased with the depth of discussion and quality of questions we received during the meetings ErisX participated in.""  Likewise, Anthony Tu-Sekine, partner at the law firm of Seward & Kissel LLP, told CoinDesk that the staffers he met with had a ""genuine interest"" in blockchain, as well as some level of understanding.  ""I think it is fair to say that most of their perceptions are formed based on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,"" he added. ""I think it is important that the community take every opportunity to educate the staff about other blockchain applications, to avoid a situation where all of the discourse (and potential legislation) is driven by concerns associated with cryptocurrencies or their issuers.""  In the days before Congress held its hearings, a draft bill began circulating which would prevent companies with more than $25 billion in assets from providing financial services, written by members of the House Financial Services Committee. Rep. Ted Budd (R.-NC) told CoinDesk that in his view, the bill seemed overly broad.  While the bill appeared targeted at Facebook in particular, it could possibly also impact Apple and Google, both of which offer payment services, he said.  Despite Rep. Maxine Waters (D.-CA), chair of the House Financial Services Committee, saying the bill would be discussed during Wednesday’s hearing, the matter did not actually come up for any substantive discussion.  Chen Arad, chief marketing officer of compliance Solidus Labs, said the way the committee appears to be handling the potential legislation was a positive sign.  ""I particularly appreciated Chairman Waters repeatedly admitting the committee doesn't understand the issue well enough, and that they're looking to learn before they can take legislative action effectively,"" he said.  Congress seems interested in taking some action, Boring said. Her hope is that any legislation or other action is informed, with industry stakeholders taking part in the conversation. She concluded:  ""We want to make sure whatever that is is not just a knee-jerk reaction to one company.""
