42386484,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTScb,1618441200,ePIC Blockchain Raises $7.5M to Manufacture ASIC Crypto Miners in North America,"Toronto-based ePIC blockchain has wrapped up a $7.5 million series A funding round to bring ASIC manufacturing to North America.      “North America excels in a lot of chip technology, so there’s no reason that North America shouldn’t excel in Blockchain ASIC design and manufacturing,” ePIC CEO Henry Quan told CoinDesk. “There’s a lack of supply. New entrants can’t come in and get access to technology, so it’s kept a lot of players out.”    Read more: The Rise of ASICs: A Step-by-Step History of Bitcoin Mining    So-called application specific circuit (ASIC) miners are built specifically for mining cryptocurrencies, typically bitcoin, because they produce the hashes needed to mine blocks at a much more rapid rate than graphics cards or normal computer processors. ePIC currently builds ASICs for altcoins.      ASIC manufacturing is a sub-industry that, like crypto’s larger mining industry, is concentrated in China. As the only ASIC manufacturer in North America with a live product, ePIC’s expansion, (and any other’s that follow it) could relieve a supply-chain bottleneck that has plagued North American miners particularly during this bull market, causing a lack of access to mining machines.      “Having a North American ASIC manufacturer is critical for the long-term security of the Bitcoin network given supply chain constraints coming out of China and the need for more hashrate based in NA,” Ethan Vera, the CFO of North American mining pool and technology company Luxor, told CoinDesk.      “The growth of the Chinese mining ecosystem was a partial result of proximity to ASIC manufacturers. We can expect the same relationship to hold true with a North American ASIC manufacturer.”    Read more: How Bitcoin Mining Works    The mining manufacturer’s customers include Argo, an American miner with a foothold in Texas, and CoreScientific, the largest mining datacenter provider in North America. ePIC will use the funding to produce its 3rd generation ASIC model which will be used to mine a “top 10 cryptocurrency,” according to Quan. The new rig is codenamed Amnesia and is forthcoming in Q4 of this year.      ePIC currently produces ASICs to mine decentralized storage project Siacoin. With a team stacked with alumni from microchip manufacturer AMD, Quan told CoinDesk that developing Bitcoin ASICs is on the company’s roadmap.    Bitcoin miners hungry for hashrate    Over the past year, miners have been in a mad dash for the metal, energy and warehouse necessary to expand their operations to cash in on the digital gold rush.      But the demand has meant that many miners, particularly those an ocean away from the foundries that source the machines they need, have to wait to access hardware. This has sent the price of old machines skyrocketing, as even machines as old as 2014 were in profit, leading into Bitcoin’s largest difficult adjustment this month.    Read more: Bitcoin Hashrate Surpasses All-Time High as Even 2014 ASICs Stay Profitable    Investment into North America’s mining sector has shown no signs of slowing, with some major players attempting to increase their hashrate as much as tenfold by the end of the year.      Manufacturers like ePIC could correct the lopsided supply chain logistics these miners currently face.      “North America could be a mining powerhouse but three key pieces need to come together for that to happen. There’s a lot of cheap energy here, commercial miners and a favorable political climate, so that’s the first thing. Mining pools are another piece, which we have with Luxor and DCG. And now, we have the third piece with ePIC and ASIC manufacturing,” he said.      Quan would not specify when the company will begin producing ASICs for bitcoin mining. He commented that “bitcoin ASICs are the holy grail,” but to “compete in that market, one needs a lot of capital and access to leading edge foundry nodes such as 5 nanometer,” perhaps something for series B round, he intimated.      Luxor’s Vera commented that “starting with altcoin miners is an interesting way to approach creating a new bitcoin ASIC company as often it is less competitive and can be a good testing ground before entering the major leagues.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/14/epic-blockchain-raises-75m-to-manufacture-asic-crypto-miners-in-north-america,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0bb650454ad66db06a2faff3573254777cd98112-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386478,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTSXZ,1618436170,$623M in Bitcoin From 2016 Bitfinex Hack Moved Under Cover of COIN Hype,"Over $623 million worth of bitcoin (BTC) stolen from Bitfinex in 2016 was moved on Wednesday, according to Twitter account Whale Alert, coming on the same day the whole market celebrated a milestone in crypto history: Coinbase's direct listing on Nasdaq.    Trade The Chain, a real-time crypto data service, confirmed the number of bitcoin moved, and said it amounts to about 10% of the total 119,756 BTC stolen from Bitfinex in 2016's hack.  The activity came as cryptocurrency exchange giant Coinbase went live with its direct listing on Nasdaq and analysts told CoinDesk the timing may not be a coincidence.  ""We believe that the BTC transfers started during the trading for Coinbase's direct listing,"" Nick Mancini, research analyst at Trade the Chain, told CoinDesk in an interview. ""The media shields allows them to at least get less publicity, considering there are fewer people tracking their movements or reporting it ... everyone's focused on the Coinbase listing.""  As Decrypt previously reported, over 5,000 BTC was also moved on Nov. 30 from the same stolen fund.  The November move of the funds came as bitcoin's price headed toward $20,000, a record high price at the time.  But some suggested the move is unlikely to create any near-term risks to bitcoin's price.  ""The 2016 Bitfinex hack BTC are some of the most tracked and blacklisted funds in the world,"" Adam Cochran, a partner with Cinneamhain Venture, wrote in a tweet. ""No exchange will process them. They can basically never be cashed out.""  However, with the rise of decentralized exchanges, Mancini said that there might be ways for the ""bad actors"" from the hack to obfuscate the addresses of the stolen bitcoin through popular crypto fundraising methods such as initial DEX offerings (IDOs).  ""Although it is time-consuming, difficult and somewhat trackable, we have seen with the wallets of where the money was transferred, they are already trying to obfuscate everything as best as possible,"" Mancini said. ""I suspect that this is not the final destination for these coins but a first destination for a path of many ways that these bad actors will take to eventually extract value out of the bitcoin.

42386488,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTSit,1618433676,The World Is Watching as Coinbase Goes Public,"Coinbase's public listing will have an impact on cryptocurrency adoption, regulation and acceptance worldwide, executives at international crypto exchanges told CoinDesk.      The U.S.-based Coinbase began trading shares at $381 on Wednesday, making it the largest direct listing of all time. Exchanges around the world are paying close attention.      “Everyone is watching this IPO – the direct listing precisely. Its implication is more than a pure IPO, but for the first time a crypto exchange [is] to be listed publicly,” Lennix Lai, director of Financial Markets at Seychelles-based crypto exchange OKEx, told CoinDesk via a written statement.      According to Joel Edgerton, Director of Japan’s largest crypto exchange bitFlyer (with subsidiaries in the U.S. and Europe), bitFlyer sees the Coinbase listing as an early milestone for the crypto industry that will hopefully set a precedent for other countries to accelerate the adoption of crypto globally      “As one of the most widely recognized crypto brands in the West, Coinbase's IPO underscores a major shift in the global financial infrastructure as more and more people embrace digital assets. We've seen this shift accelerate in many of the markets we serve but this moment marks the dawn of mainstream crypto adoption,” Du Jun, co-founder of Huobi group told CoinDesk via a statement.      Coinbase financials are now available to the public for analysis so there’s a higher chance of attracting potential investors to crypto, according to Konstantin Anissimov, executive director at U.K.-based CEX.IO.      “We’ll see an influx of former bankers, consultants and entrepreneurs trying to build in this space,” Anissimov told CoinDesk, adding that for bankers and consultants who are usually conservative in their career choices, this assurance will ease the decision to enter the industry.      “Entrepreneurs are often inspired by good stories of creating something larger than themselves. Coinbase, certainly, can serve [as] an example of that,” Anissimov said.      The public listing is sure to attract institutional investors, propelling the entire industry forward, according to Vitaliy Kedyk, head of Strategy at U.K.-headquartered Currency.com. Digital assets will soon become an important component of every diversified portfolio just like gold, bonds and other alternative assets, added Jun.      But, Kedyk added, Coinbase may need to win a battle against decentralized exchanges (DEXs) that allow direct peer-to-peer trading of crypto assets without an intermediary, which are also on the rise.      “Centralized exchanges like Coinbase are in an interesting position. They are bringing awareness to the decentralized economy and acting as a gateway for the general public to enter this new and emerging space. So it will be interesting to see how Coinbase fares against DEXs going forward,” Kedyk said.    Regulation    Huobi’s Jun anticipates the attention around the Coinbase listing will drive regulators around the globe to get more involved with digital assets, which he believes will benefit the industry.      “A move toward a more standardized and defined regulatory landscape will make it easier for exchanges like ours to provide users with a safe, secure, and reliable trading experience and ensure the industry's long-term sustainability,"" Jun said.      Lai from OKEx added that the institutional acceptance conveyed through this public listing means a lot to regulators, and it could be a good reference for other countries in allowing crypto exchanges to be listed on their exchanges like Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Singapore Exchange and Börse Frankfurt.      “This is a qualitative shift, demonstrating acceptance of a crypto player in the traditional finance territory. Big validation point!” Anissimov said.      Anissimov also believes that because Coinbase will now be subject to public scrutiny, it will set new ""standards of behavior” for other aspiring industry participants, which also may also wish to go public one day.      “Given the standards publicly traded companies are held to, the higher standards will transpire to the crypto industry at large,” Anissimov said.    First of many    Other crypto exchanges are indeed looking to follow in Coinbase’s footsteps.      Kris Marszalek, chief executive officer of Crypto.com – which is headquartered in Hong Kong – said he is watching Coinbase’s market debut closely because it will provide a reference point for Crypto.com’s own valuation as the first publicly traded comparable.      “For reference, while Coinbase has approximately five [times] more users than Crypto.com, we are growing faster and are looking to largely close this gap in the next 18-24 months,” Marszalek said.      A lot of exchanges on the market could potentially be listed on local stock exchanges, like Bithump in South Korea, bitFlyer in Japan, Kraken in Europe, or Bitrrex and OKCoin in the U.S. Lai said, adding that Huobi or his own firm OKEx could get onto Asia-Pacific exchanges as in HKEX (Hong Kong) or SGX (Singapore).      “However, there should be standards in place similar to those applied to Coinbase, especially on the listing requirements, the audit statements, and everything related to crypto exchanges,” Lai said.      Lai assumes the next crypto exchange that goes public would be in the U.S. because Coinbase has already set an example.      “So, I think moving forward other exchanges would consider investing in the U.S. first and then other global markets,” Lai said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/14/the-world-is-watching-as-coinbase-goes-public,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1c98b64c19534e9f00b1a2800cee9cbb7632b0bc-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Slipping 1.38% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $61,400.28-$64,829.14 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC trades between its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a sideways signal for market technicians.    Fundamentals seem to be taking the back seat to the hype of the moment; Coinbase’s direct listing today on Nasdaq looks like the one thing that is driving up the whole crypto market. Nonetheless, there are indeed fundamental factors at play as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies trade near all-time highs.      Bitcoin, the No. 1 cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rose to near $65,000 during early trading hours in the U.S. on Wednesday, hours before Coinbase shares began trading on the Nasdaq.      Spot trading volume on eight crypto exchanges tracked by CoinDesk, although slightly lower than a day ago, continued to show increased activity and was near $4 billion at press time.      While it may seem like Coinbase’s Nasdaq listing has been pumping prices in bitcoin and other cryptos, Mati Greenspan, founder and CEO of Quantum Economics, views it the other way around. According to him, Coinbase timed the listing with bitcoin bull’s run. “Coinbase isn’t pumping bitcoin. Bitcoin is pumping Coinbase,” he said in his newsletter Wednesday.      At press time, 98 cryptocurrencies on Messari are worth more than $1 billion – the number was 100 during early trading hours in the U.S. on Wednesday.      Coinbase’s direct listing “is timely,” wrote Philip Gradwell, chief economist at blockchain data firm Chainalysis, in his newsletter on April 14. “The market has radically changed in the last six months with the entry of new, often very large, institutional investors, who have paid high prices for their cryptocurrency.”      Indeed, despite the hype, bitcoin’s market fundamentals may give a more meaningful explanation on why bitcoin’s price has continued to triumph.      More than 2 million BTC have changed hands on the blockchain at prices above $50,000, according to Gradwell, while about 608,000 BTC were acquired at prices at or above $57,000.      “It demonstrates the level of investment in cryptocurrency: those 2.3 million at or above $50,000 for bitcoin cost $125 billion,” Gradwell wrote. “Such levels of investment require large companies that can face the scrutiny of the public market.”      At the same time, the so-called coin years destroyed (CYD) metric tracked by Glassnode also indicates that bitcoin long-term holders (“HODLers”) are still in the accumulation phase, providing further bullish support to the price.

Ether’s 24-hour range: $2,268.57-$2,399.61 (CoinDesk 20)  Ether trades between its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a sideways signal for market technicians.    Ether, along with many other alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), also logged more gains on Wednesday.      Besides ether, which is the No. 2 cryptocurrency by market capitalization, one of the most staggering growth spurts was seen with dogecoin (DOGE), the beloved meme cryptocurrency that was created back in 2013.      As a result, dogecoin now has a market capitalization of more than $16 billion, surpassing that of bitcoin cash (BCH) and chainlink (LINK), per Messari data.      Dogecoin’s sudden price surge also came with escalating trading activity: data from CoinGecko also shows that dogecoin is the No. 5 most traded token of the day, only behind tether (USDT), bitcoin, ether and XRP.      Other digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly lower on Wednesday.

42386490,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTSmf,1618429386,Privacy Will 'Become a More Popular Investing Theme': Barry Silbert,"In his first public interview in eight months, Barry Silbert, co-founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group (CoinDesk’s parent company), placed an emphasis on privacy and privacy coins when discussing what protocols and areas he was following closely.      In an appearance this morning on CoinDesk TV’s ""First Mover,"" Silbert said he believes privacy will be a draw for investors and mentioned two privacy coins he’s particularly excited about and focused on: zcash and Horizen's zen.      “Thematically, I think privacy is – and is going to become – a more popular investing theme,” Silbert said.      Zcash, currently the 51st largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was developed by Electric Coin Company (ECC). It recently announced a timeline for launching a variety of upgrades to the protocol that include privacy enhancements.    Read more: Zcash Announces ‘Halo Arc’ and Timeline for Protocol Privacy Update    The Horizen protocol, whose token, zen, is the 101st largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is a sidechain platform that “focuses on scalable data privacy and enables businesses and developers to custom build their own public or private blockchains using its unique sidechain technology, Zendoo,” according to its website.      “Privacy is at the core of what we’re all building for our collective future. It’s the most significant threat to those who wish to control others, and the most significant hope for a fair and open economy,” said Josh Swihart, ECC’s vice president of Growth in a message. “It’s at the center of everything regulators are wrestling with right now – from self-hosted wallets to [decentralized finance]. It is the key issue, the critical feature.”    How privacy coins have performed    Justin Barlow, research analyst at crypto data firm The Tie, told CoinDesk in a message that compared to other sectors, privacy coins have performed relatively well this year.      ""The average privacy coin is up about 550% year to date. For comparison, the average smart contract platform is up only about 350% and the average currency is up only around 175%,"" said Barlow. ""Privacy coins have underperformed DeFi (~875% YTD) and exchange tokens (~1,250% YTD).""      Barlow said there is an argument for privacy coins as people value the untraceable transactions they offer for both legitimate and illicit activity.      ""Over time, as bitcoin has become more mainstream, many in the community have realized that BTC transactions easily traceable,"" he said. ""Those that have been proponents of the anonymity or now psuedo-anonymity of the Bitcoin blockchain might gravitate towards privacy coins. Keep in mind that Chainalysis has found that only 0.9% of zcash transactions are fully shielded so it isn't entirely clear how much demand is out there yet.""    Privacy increasingly under scrutiny    Silbert’s comments come amid both an exciting and troubling time for privacy and cryptocurrency. As bitcoin is booming and the non-fungible token craze continues, attention around cryptocurrencies is increasing generally – and privacy is a question that will again come to the forefront of a variety of debates.      In the first report from the Cryptocurrency Council on Innovation, a newly formed trade group, a former acting director of the CIA, Michael Morrell, wrote that ""the broad generalizations about the use of bitcoin in illicit finance are significantly overstated"" and ""blockchain analysis is a highly effective crime-fighting and intelligence-gathering tool ... a 'boon for surveillance.'""      While the report was largely seen as a boon for bitcoin, in a Twitter thread on the report, Swihart noted, “That bitcoin crimes are overstated seems to be consistent with data. However, the argument that it's good that the U.S. can surveil everything is fatally flawed, and ironically, not even in the best interest of a surveillance state.”    Read more: Brave Acquires Tailcat to Create Private Search Engine Competitor to Google    “If U.S. law enforcement can trace and exploit public financial data, so can China, N. Korea, Russia and even the very ransomware attackers who the report claims demand ransom in something that protects privacy,” he tweeted. “This is a massive national security issue.”      Swihart said the report seemed like an attempt to shift risk from BTC to so-called Anonymity Enhancing Cryptocurrencies (AECs).      A week ago, the Quadrennial Global Trends report from the National Intelligence Council also warned that privacy will “effectively disappear.”      Moving forward, how the cryptocurrency world and regulators interact around privacy and privacy coins will be an ongoing question that has no easy answer.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | ZEC,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/04/14/privacy-will-become-a-more-popular-investing-theme-barry-silbert,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9eaac566de66c141758ed2c4e773b0fe8839704f-1600x1065.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

After opening at $381 at around 1:30 p.m. ET, Coinbase shares (NASDAQ: COIN) soared to as high as $429.54 before dropping more than 100 points over the next hour and a half to close at $328. That was below the $348 price where the shares last changed hands in private markets.      ""There's always a lot of excitement that builds up to this moment,"" FundStrat analyst David Grider told CoinDesk. ""That excitement rolled over a little bit.""      Even with their dizzying drop, Coinbase shares were well above their $250 reference price assigned Tuesday evening by the Nasdaq. Compared to the first trade of $381, however, COIN closed down 14% on the day.      At a share price of $328, Coinbase would have a valuation of about $65 billion, assuming 199.2 million shares outstanding. Using the fully diluted share count of 261.3 million, the implied market capitalization would be about $86 billion.      Earlier in the day, Coinbase had achieved a valuation over $100 billion, based on the higher share count.      ""The uninformed were driving price on it more than the informed,"" said Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at the cryptocurrency asset manager Arca.

Apple, worth $2.2 trillion, is worth about 6.5% of the entire index. Now, imagine if it were instead worth $20 trillion and were two-thirds the S&P 500. That's the situation bitcoin is in relative to all other cryptocurrencies.      However, it is important to categorize crypto assets by size. The Digital Large Cap Index (DLCX) covers what might be considered the large-cap segment of the crypto asset universe: the top 70% by cumulative market cap. (This is the threshold MSCI, an index provider, uses to define the large-cap category.)      ""Bitcoin dominance"" is a metric that measures bitcoin's share of the aggregate market cap of all cryptocurrencies. It's also often used to measure investor interest in altcoins. The chart above shows the minimum bitcoin dominance rate in each quarter.      As bitcoin reached all-time highs, crypto's total market cap rose above $2 trillion just at the end of the first quarter. However, bitcoin dominance slid to lows not seen in two years because the value of every other cryptocurrency combined rose faster than the first crypto. This underscores the need for an index capable of covering market dynamics like this.      Last quarter saw changes in the composition of the index for the first time since its inception in 2018. On Jan. 5, we excluded XRP, after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued the currency's issuer, Ripple, alleging the asset is an unregistered security. Regulatory risk is one of the subjective index composition criteria.    Chainlink market cap surged in Q1    Last month, I wrote about how a newer generation of altcoins has been outpacing some of the stalwart large-cap alts in returns.      Chainlink (LINK) was one of the top assets for the quarter by returns. The chart above shows how its average quarterly market cap reflected the gains, more than doubling, to cross the $10 billion mark.    Read more: ‘Altcoin Season’ Leaves Some Bitcoin Alternatives Frozen    That put the chainlink token into large-cap territory, but market cap is not the only criterion for inclusion. The index is designed to be replicable by U.S. financial institutions: firms that use it to trade or create financial products must be able to access liquid markets for the constituent assets.      The chart above shows chainlink's sum quarterly volume in U.S. dollar trading pairs on exchanges that are accessible to U.S. financial institutions. This picture of chainlink's liquidity is distinct from one that might include volumes reported by offshore exchanges and volumes in pairs against stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies. As the chart shows, chainlink's volume on institutionally viable exchanges also doubled its previous quarterly high in Q1.      When bitcoin trades in a band, as it has for the past month, some investors begin to anticipate a dramatic break, in one direction or another. As chainlink’s data shows, Q1 brought dramatic changes in the altcoin landscape. That change is reflected in the DLCX. It's just a hunch, but I feel it's possible further shifts may be in store in Q2.",NEUTRAL,LINK | XRP,ALTCOIN | BTC | LINK | MARKET | XRP,Galen Moore,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/14/how-chainlink-replaced-xrp-in-the-digital-large-cap-index,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d74d9f6668ec79d2e69ff44d2af81ef708fb9c0d-2106x1424.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413317,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8MOo,1618421310,Coinbase Direct Listing Gets $100B+ Valuation as Share Price Jumps in Nasdaq Debut,"Coinbase, the biggest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, went live with its direct listing on Nasdaq, on a day when bitcoin rallied to a fresh all-time high.  The shares fluctuated in the first hours of trading, starting at $381 and initially jumping above $400 but dropping as of press time to about $378.  “The price of COIN will be very volatile,” said James Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University who specializes in financial-market structure. “We can expect it to fluctuate along with the prices of cryptocurrencies. Investors should buckle up their seatbelts and expect a wild ride.”  Analysts, traders and economists characterized the share sale as a milestone for cryptocurrencies, with the biggest U.S. exchange now getting exposure to mainstream stock-market investors. The event has also been tabbed as a catalyst that might drive adoption of digital assets.  “This is a watershed moment for the digital asset industry, as it signifies a larger moment of credibility for a market that is maturing rapidly,” said Hunter Merghart, head of U.S. for rival cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp.  Based on the latest trading price, Coinbase would have a market capitalization of $76 billion, based on an outstanding share count of 199.2 million. The figure would be $99 billion using the fully diluted share count of 261.3 million.  The initial trading price was 52% above the reference price of $250 a share published late Tuesday by the Nasdaq. But it was well below some of the price targets issued recently by stock analysts, with some estimates ranging as high as $600 a share.  A home on the Nasdaq  Coinbase, which has no official headquarters, opted to avoid an initial public offering (IPO) and instead directly list its shares on the Nasdaq stock exchange, without relying on Wall Street investment banks serving as underwriters to set the pricing.  “The reason we’re doing a direct listing is that it’s going to get all market participants,” Coinbase CFO Alesia Haas told CoinDesk in an interview. “We’re not allocating shares to just 10 institutions. This is going to be a robust, deep price discovery. And we’re excited to see where that market ends up.”  Prices for bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency by market value, soared Wednesday to a new all-time high above $64,000, settling back to about $63,500 as of press time. Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second-biggest overall, also rose to a record price of around $2,400.  “COIN listing is the validation of an investment thesis that crypto is not a niche market anymore,” said Campbell Harvey, a professor of international business at Duke University. “It is a new mainstream market.”  Even Coinbase’s competitors are getting in on the action: Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, announced Wednesday it will list a digital token backed by Coinbase shares.  “Coinbase has enormous scarcity value, as a one-of-a-kind, pure expression of the secular cryptocurrency trend,” Lisa Ellis, an analyst for the brokerage firm MoffettNathanson, wrote Tuesday in a report recommending a ""buy"" on COIN shares, with a one-year price target of $600 a share. “We are bullish on cryptocurrency technology. While still nascent, we believe it is one of the most disruptive technology innovations in decades.”  Coinbase has consistently created new venture capital funding records in crypto, so it was befitting that the exchange would move forward with the first direct listing in the space.  See also: The Definitive Guide to Coinbase Going Public  The company’s growth prospects have become the subject of a great deal of analyst speculation after a blowout first-quarter earnings presentation last week that showed off the profitability of the company but also the volatility of its business model.  The exchange reported $1.8 billion in revenue for the quarter (versus $1.27 billion for the full year 2020). Coinbase gave no revenue guidance (as a publicly traded company normally would), but instead gave scenarios for user growth depending on different outcomes in the crypto market. It reported 6.1 million active users in the first quarter, more than double the number during the final quarter of 2020.  ‘Difficult to justify’  Some industry analysts were skeptical of Coinbase’s sky-high valuation.  “It does seem difficult to justify these numbers,” Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics. “There is the old saying that in a gold rush, the ones who make the most money are the guys selling picks and shovels. This certainly applies to Coinbase.”  Coinbase requires investors to not only have a view on the future of bitcoin but also on other crypto exchanges and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) that will be competing with it for market share, Duke’s Harvey said. (The Duke University endowment was an early investor in Coinbase.)  “To simply extrapolate from past results ignores the competition,” Harvey said. “Most people are operating in the world of centralized finance and [decentralized finance] is not just a novel cryptocurrency. It’s reinventing financial infrastructure.”  While many equity analysts are looking at how Coinbase is turning its large pool of users into active users that trade on the app every month, some have said that COIN could end up trading like a proxy bitcoin ETF, as some investors are now possibly using MicroStrategy (MSTR) shares.  It also means that pension funds and endowments will be looking at other early-stage private companies in the crypto space that have the potential to follow Coinbase’s growth history, Harvey added.  “Developments like this help bring confidence to this still nascent, but as the last year has demonstrated, resilient, asset class,” David Mercer, CEO of the LMAX crypto exchange, said in an emailed comment.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Damanick Dantes",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/14/coinbase-direct-listing-gets-100b-valuation-as-share-price-jumps-in-nasdaq-debut,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1407a51ae87cc1ba5533cf4de194ad70956032e0-1400x785.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386493,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTSpB,1618419914,Bitcoin Uptrend Intact as HODLers Seem Less Tempted to Sell,"The near two-fold rise in bitcoin (BTC) over the past year has rewarded long-term holders (hodlers) who are still in the accumulation phase. This suggests that, following bitcoin’s break to an all-time high above $63,000, bullish activity is just getting started.      BTC is roughly 3% lower at the time of writing after reaching an all-time high around $64,800. But despite short-term profit taking, the long-term uptrend is intact.      ""It is likely that the coins purchased by institutions in late 2020 and early 2021 are starting to mature,” according to a recent report by Glassnode, a cryptocurrency analytics firm. “The HODLer Position Change metric is trending higher and if these institutional buyers did HODL, it is likely to continue in this trajectory over the coming months.”    Glassnode’s ""coin years destroyed"" (CYD) metrics track the number of days represented by each hodling ""streak"" within a 365-day period before that streak ends or is ""destroyed."" CYD is currently trending higher at a level like the 2013 BTC price top, but still well below the 2017 top.  “Given the bitcoin network is older, and coins in supply have had more time to accumulate, if many HODLers were spending their coins, we would expect a relatively large CYD reading.”  In general, HODLers are not spending their old bitcoin, which suggests the current bull market still has legs.    Macroeconomic factors could be a driving force for long-term bitcoin holdings. Many investors see bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and continued dollar debasement. And the search for yield could encourage greater flows into bitcoin.      “We could see flows out of fixed income and into cryptocurrencies as rates rise,” said Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, a market analysis and advisory firm, during an interview with CoinDesk. This could usher in a new generation of HODLers seeking high-yield potential.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Damanick Dantes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/14/bitcoin-uptrend-intact-as-hodlers-seem-less-tempted-to-sell,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a8b656ef7eb0889df12731f48b2866ae95e392ca-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386495,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTSqR,1618418313,The Fundamentals of Crypto's $2T Market Cap,"Crypto isn’t magic. It’s math. Two trillion dollars worth of math.      We are still, often, asked incorrect questions about the crypto currency markets, like “but what is the fundamental value?”      You have to unpack the word “fundamental.” That word signals a Warren Buffett view of the world: There are companies out there, they have equity shares well specified by corporate law in a particular jurisdiction, some are expensive while some are cheap, and that bargain-shopping can be determined by a spreadsheet analysis of their cash flows relative to others. It’s so fundamental!    Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is Global Fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his Fintech Blueprint newsletter.    The story of such fundamental truth is anchored in our cultural and social history. We can point to the intellectual tradition of rationalism and classical economics, and talk about the theory of the firm, and its production function. We can point to how these things grew out of governance by religion, and natural rights as granted by a deity, and all sorts of other non-empirical hand waving.      We can talk about supply and demand, and equilibria, and describe some agents in a perfect market with perfectly formed property rights. And some of these agents, surely, will be “good” (i.e., cheap relative to performance) and some will be “bad” (i.e., expensive tulips).      Then we look at the real world and learn that markets are imperfect and deceptive, that humans behave irrationally because of their evolutionary biology programming, that top-down rationalist models don’t square with reality, that some of Warren Buffet’s best investments are in fact political and derive from monopoly market structure, and that the whole machine is careening off a cliff into imagination land.    Read more: Lex Sokolin - How Coinbase Is Worth $100B    That doesn’t mean that equities traded on a stock market, as circumscribed by their full supporting human history, can’t be valued relative to each other. On the contrary, they demonstrate that having people agree on a mathematical framework for structuring economic exchange can create that specific economic exchange. But we are living in a system that exhibits complexity, and which appears random not due to some underlying randomness, but because of the exponential interaction of underlying mechanisms. Any math that we put around it is an approximation.      And so the financial models we trade on the markets are not companies; they are beliefs derived from financial models correlated to the promise of legal enforcement. The models represent real world activities, and it is that representation that is being priced, bought and sold.      Let’s assume that we’ve budged your conviction about what is financially real. Turning to crypto networks, we can see that many of the elements of “assets traded on a stock market” do not apply to them. They are not always companies duly organized in Delaware, but often a global smattering of individuals across the Twitterverse. While some deliver cash flows, it is not always the financial attributes that networks seek to grow but economic or operating ones.      So instead of using questions like “How can we maximize profit to accrue to owners?,” they use questions like “How can we get this industry to create a virtuous cycle for storing data for itself on this network?”    Read more: Lex Sokolin: The Revolution You’ve Been Awaiting: Fintech + DeFi    This is the type of question that a community manager or online game designer may ask. It is also the type of question that a well-cultured traditional company may ask if it has a Steve Jobs or Jeff Bezos customer orientation, supplanted with an open source ethos.      This is what is worth two trillion dollars.      Sometimes things fail, even though they were the right idea at the time: Morgan Stanley robo-advisers from 2001, machine learning algorithms from the 1970s, video streaming in the mid-2000s. The surrounding infrastructure was not the right soil for that particular idea to grow at the time. All you get is a bunch of salty entrepreneurs.      When the first token offering wave hit in 2017 and 2018, smart people began to establish a formal practice of token engineering, sometimes called crypto economics or tokenomics. It is rooted in rigorous game theory, mechanism design, and mathematical simulation. There was a notable difference in the quality of thinking across the industry. Some teams used terms from this field as if they were magic summoning words, and that in saying those words, correct outcomes would simply appear. Other teams built concepts for the long term with system design in mind.    Read more: Lex Sokolin: How the OCC Is Building Crypto America    There was a lot less data around in 2017 about what would end up working. Overly mathematical papers looked like nonsense in an environment where Telegram and EOS were raising over $1 billion each based on business logic and hype. Much of that vapor would dissipate, and the unpopular inventors went onto new frontiers.      Yet, over the long run, there are stark differences between successful and unsuccessful token design. This practice is the closest “truth” we get to the concept of fundamentals in the crypto ecosystem. You can create a network or protocol with incentives that drive usage and value into the ground — a Nash equilibrium with bad pay-offs.      Sometimes those paths to a bad equilibrium come from edge conditions, such as too much demand and popularity. The Fei protocol, which attempts to create an algorithmic stablecoin with punishing mechanics for selling the pegged coin, ran a fund-raise recently that attracted over $1 billion of capital, but quickly lost its mark-to-market value. While we are not endorsing any particular view on this asset, the following threads are instructive in showing how incentive design created the opposite of the desired outcome, and is now resulting in emergency action.    Crypto isn’t magic. It’s math. Two trillion dollars worth of math.    In a counter-example, we can look at Ocean Protocol and The Graph. Both projects had spent years sweating their tokenomics and openly discussing design ideas (not that Fei hasn’t). The result looked over-engineered during the summer of decentralized finance (DeFi) growth and downright unnecessary in the crypto winter of 2018-2019. But it was built for the long run. And when these projects launched, their machines ground into gear, generating purpose-built economic activities.      In a counter-example, we can look at Ocean Protocol and The Graph.

And when these projects launched, their machines ground into gear, generating purpose-built economic activities.    Read more: Berg & Davidson: DeFi Governance Needs Better Tokenomics    It is imperative to have clarity and insights into what exactly one is trying to grow and optimize. In the parlance of linear programming or machine learning, you have to know your objective function – the exact equation, and thereby outcome, that you want to maximize. And as a corollary, you have to know how that function actually works: its inputs, its outputs, and how the gears turn to generate the outputs. This is the opposite of meme-based investment frameworks, and should be comfort to asset allocators looking for “fundamentals.”      You also need to think about where the incentives are plugging in. Some will be nested into the actual legal and economic system, or equivalently the underlying blockchain network. Others will live at the equivalent level of the firm, and be structured as protocols or platforms. Such projects will have incentives focused on particular digital assets, their adoption and customer behaviors. Yet, other digital assets will be self-contained products, like the art non-fungible tokens now coming to market, and power only the asset itself.      This approach to growth sounds novel but can be actually found internally at companies with strongly articulated cultures, like Amazon or Bridgewater Associates, accomplished through social and compensation mechanisms. Software has much higher precision around the specification of what agents can do with the software itself. Therefore, network-orchestrated organizations are currently more quantitative rather than the qualitative human social norm. It is this mathematics that is creating the $2 trillion of value now attributed to digital asset ecosystems. And it is this practice that will be a core part of valuing our future economies.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Lex Sokolin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/04/14/the-fundamentals-of-cryptos-2t-market-cap,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/97a85961183f73bd19c98908bd03c81c660b9ae7-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386481,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTSbL,1618417718,Senate Confirms Gary Gensler as Next SEC Chief,"It’s official: Gary Gensler is the new chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after a 53-45 vote by the U.S. Senate on Wednesday.      Gensler, who was nominated to the position by President Joe Biden in January, previously ran the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), overseeing the implementation of new regulations around derivatives in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. As SEC chair, he’ll have ample opportunity to shape regulations addressing the cryptocurrency industry – or determine how existing regulations should apply.      “Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have brought new thinking to payments and financial inclusion, but they’ve also raised new issues of investor protection that we still need to attend to,” Gensler said during a confirmation hearing held by the Senate Banking Committee last month. “If confirmed at the SEC, I’d work with fellow commissioners to both promote the new innovation, but also at the core to ensure investor protection.”      Gensler will take office as his agency grapples with a number of high-profile actions in the cryptocurrency space, including its ongoing lawsuit against Ripple, which the SEC has accused of violating federal securities laws, and nine bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications, which industry participants have clamored for for years.      He has already weighed in on some of these issues as a private citizen lecturing at MIT. In 2018, he called XRP a “non-compliant security,” and said other initial coin offerings might violate U.S. securities laws.      The SEC will also be watching as Coinbase goes public on Wednesday, following the agency’s deeming its form S-1 effective (essentially a tacit approval).      Gensler will also have to deal with a number of issues around the existing stock market, including the Gamestop volatility from earlier this year.

42386487,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTShd,1618414387,The Node: Coinbase Is the Listing to End All Listings,"Coinbase going public today is the last stock listing that will ever matter.      That may not be true, but isn’t it kind of odd that that sentence doesn’t sound entirely off base?    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Coinbase, the Silicon Valley-based cryptocurrency exchange, today plans to directly list 114,850,769 existing shares on Nasdaq. Its valuations range from $65 billion and $100 billion and beyond. That would make it more valuable than traditional exchanges like New York Stock Exchange parent Intercontinental Exchange and the exchange Coinbase’s stock (COIN) will trade on.      The listing is a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency industry. Once shunned by financial giants, crypto is now marching inexorably to mass adoption bringing institutions along with it.      Coinbase’s pitch to potential investors is largely that of crypto itself: That decentralized, open financial technologies will disrupt the way we do business. Founded in 2012, Coinbase’s mission has been to make crypto trading as easy as sending email.      By most accounts, it has succeeded. The second-largest exchange by trading volume, according to CoinMarketCap, Coinbase boasts 56 million users globally and $223 billion assets on its platform. It’s garnered over $3.4 billion in total revenue since its inception. What started out as merely an onramp has grown into what some call a crypto-native bank.      The road here has been bumpy. Coinbase reports that 95% of its revenue comes from trading fees. In times of market exuberance, the exchange is remarkably profitable. With BTC and ETH rising to all-time highs, Coinbase reported revenues of $1.8 billion in Q1, more than double what it saw throughout 2020.      There have also been lean times; the exchange ran a $45 million deficit in 2019. Other years, it made existential decisions. The unpredictability of the crypto markets is one of the many risks Coinbase cited in its going-public prospectus – along with the reemergence of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto.      Apart from an industry downturn, skeptics think Coinbase might find itself in a race-towards-the-bottom scenario related to its core business. Right now, Coinbase charges a significant premium for trading on its platform – attributed to its status as a regulated, and historically-secure exchange.      As Fortune noted, even though volumes on Nasdaq and ICE far exceed those on Coinbase, the crypto exchange’s margins are about 50 times higher. But as other exchanges enter the fray or look to compete – be they centralized competitors like Binance or decentralized protocols like Uniswap – Coinbase could be forced to reduce fees.      Stock research firm New Constructs compared the situation to what happened to brokerage fees when Robinhood entered the picture. “The firm’s competitive position will inevitably deteriorate,” the researchers wrote.      Still, Coinbase’s central position to an industry that is reshaping the world means it’s not going anyway. Institutions that are unable or unwilling to buy cryptocurrencies directly may view the exchange’s stock as a way to gain exposure to the sector.      Crypto itself is just beginning. Coinbase is just the first major crypto firm to go public in the U.S. There will be many more. Wallets, custodians, payments firms are building a new digital-first financial system that are out-disrupting the disruptors.      Fintechs are still media darlings, but their attachment to the legacy system that crypto is eating may be their demise. Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal reported Stripe had a banner pandemic year. It’s now reportedly valued at $95 billion.

The indication, which is far from definite as it only reflects the progress made between buyers and sellers as they work to assign a price, is 52% higher than the $250 reference price per share that Nasdaq and Goldman Sachs released yesterday afternoon.  It's only about 10% higher, however, than what the crypto exchange last traded at in the private secondary market, $343.58 per share.  As the first indication was at $345 and has steadily increased, it's a sign the price could go even higher before trading begins.  Different media are reporting various market values for Coinbase. At $380 per share, using the number of shares currently outstanding, 199.2 million, Coinbase would have a valuation of $76.0 billion, just bigger than Duke Energy.  However, if one used the number of shares if all options were exercised, 261.3 million, the value of the exchange would balloon to $99.3 billion. By that measure, Coinbase would be bigger than CVS Health and that much closer to the headline-grabbing figure of $100 billion.

For instance, MicroStrategy, the data intelligence firm that has added huge amounts of bitcoin to its balance sheet saw its shares up 18.5% over the past few days, tracing a 7.8% jump Tuesday morning that mirrored bitcoin’s rise.      The emergence of bitcoin proxy stocks in recent months has created a cottage industry among investors who want crypto’s upside but don’t (or can’t) hold crypto itself. Indeed, JPMorgan filed to launch a “Cryptocurrency Exposure Basket” in March. The need for backdoor access to bitcoin is only heightened in the U.S., where the Securities and Exchange Commission has been extremely reticent to approve a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).      Also up in global trading was Colorado-based bitcoin mining company Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ: RIOT), which saw a 15% increase; and Canaan (NASDAQ: CAN), another mining firm that saw an 11% bump over the past 24 hours.      Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was near all-time highs above $64,000 at press time.    In steps Coinbase    Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN), whose fortunes are closely wedded to the price of bitcoin, was slapped with a reference price of $250 ahead of Wednesday’s listing – somewhat lower than trading on private markets in the weeks running up to its debut.      Coinbase coming to market is a rising tide for all crypto players, said Jonathan Rowland, CEO of London-listed cryptocurrency firm Mode, whose shares are up around 12% in the past few days.      “I don't think we have seen an uptick as high as I might have expected,” Rowland said in an interview. “We think that a lot of the crypto community who invest in shares may have taken some money off the table with some of the smaller holdings like Mode in order to buy Coinbase.”    Read more: Crypto Exchange Binance to List the Coinbase Stock Token COIN    The journey Coinbase completes today will likely bring its market cap in line with the likes of Uber, BlackRock and other prominent firms.

42386491,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTSnv,1618401451,Coinbase Direct Listing: What's Happening Right Now,"UPDATE (April 14, 18:07 UTC): COIN shares started trading around 1:28 p.m ET. Read this post for the latest updates on Coinbase stock movement and valuations.      UPDATE (April 15, 4:09 UTC): Coinbase shares closed at $328 Wednesday after climbing as high as $429 in first-day trading. Read this post for a recap of COIN's Nasdaq debut.      Coinbase appeared headed for a valuation of $100 billion or more as analysts and onlookers awaited the trading debut of shares in the leading U.S. cryptocurrency exchange.      While historical experience with such direct listings suggested that trading might not go live until later in the day, financial news services were reporting early indications of the pricing.      Around 1:04 p.m. ET, Reuters reported that Coinbase was indicated to start trading at $380, well above the reference price of $250 published late Tuesday by Nasdaq. The stock ticker is COIN.      “The price of COIN will be very volatile,"" said James Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University who specializes in financial-market structure. ""We can expect it to fluctuate along with the prices of cryptocurrencies. Investors should buckle up their seatbelts and expect a wild ride.”      Coinbase, which has no official headquarters, opted to avoid an initial public offering (IPO) and instead directly list its shares on the Nasdaq stock exchange, without relying on Wall Street investment banks serving as underwriters to set the pricing.      “The reason we're doing a direct listing is that it's going to get all market participants,"" Coinbase CFO Alesia Haas told CoinDesk in an interview. ""We're not allocating shares to just 10 institutions. This is going to be a robust, deep price discovery. And we're excited to see where that market ends up.”      Such offerings are unusual, and market makers have typically needed hours to determine the appropriate opening price. When Slack, the business communication software, went public via a direct listing in June 2019, it took about two and a half hours to start trading. ""The stock opened just after noon,"" according to a Wall Street Journal story at the time.      The Coinbase listing is shaping up as a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency industry, with the biggest U.S. exchange now getting exposure to mainstream stock-market investors. The event has also been tabbed as a catalyst that might drive further adoption of digital assets.      Prices for bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency by market value, soared Wednesday to a new all-time high above $64,000, settling back to about $63,500 as of press time. Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second-biggest overall, also rose to a record price of around $2,400.      ""COIN listing is the validation of an investment thesis that crypto is not a niche market anymore,"" Campbell Harvey, a professor of international business at Duke University, told CoinDesk. ""It is a new mainstream market.”      Even Coinbase's competitors are getting in on the action: Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, announced Wednesday it will list a digital token backed by Coinbase shares.      Another venue, FTX, which recently signed a $135 million deal to take over the naming rights of the American Airlines Arena, the home court of professional basketball's Miami Heat, has listed a ""pre-IPO contract"" to track Coinbase shares. It's currently signaling a share price of $432.      The latest share-price indication, assuming 199.2 million shares outstanding, would imply a market capitalization for Coinbase of about $76 billion – roughly the same amount as BP, the oil company, and General Motors, the automaker. Using the fully diluted share count of 261.3 million, the implied market capitalization would be about $99 billion. (Coinbase is only listing its 130.7 million of Class A shares.)      Late Tuesday, the reference point for Coinbase's hotly-anticipated direct listing was set at $250 a share. The reference point is the low end of the expected opening trading range in a direct listing such as Coinbase's.      Given how that's almost $100 below the $343.58 the shares had been trading at in the private secondary market, it's almost certain that the opening price for the Coinbase shares will be far above $250 after buyers and sellers eventually assign a value to the shares of the leading cryptocurrency exchange.      As Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert succinctly put it in a tweet: ""I will not be selling any of my Coinbase stock to you at $250. Try again."" DCG, the world's largest digital asset manager, is the parent of CoinDesk.      Haas, the Coinbase CFO, said Nasdaq set the reference price and that the company wasn't involved.      “I learned about the reference price 10 minutes before the market learned about the reference price,"" said Haas. “The company is sort of, frankly, a little bit ignoring it. Because it's not an indication of anything other than what is needed to open a system.”      Lisa Ellis, an analyst for the brokerage firm MoffettNathanson, published a report Tuesday recommending COIN shares a ""buy"" with a one-year price target of $600 a share.      ""Coinbase has enormous scarcity value, as a one-of-a-kind, pure expression of the secular cryptocurrency trend,"" Ellis wrote. ""We are bullish on cryptocurrency technology. While still nascent, we believe it is one of the most disruptive technology innovations in decades.""      Given COIN's conservative reference price, it may take even longer for buyers and sellers to agree on an opening price.      This could mean traders might not see robust trading in COIN until well into the afternoon even though U.S. stock markets opened at 9:30 a.m. ET.          Coinbase has consistently created new venture capital funding records in crypto, so it's befitting that the exchange might now move forward with the first direct listing in the space.      The company's growth prospects have become the subject of a great deal of analyst speculation after a blowout first-quarter earnings presentation last week that showed off the profitability of the company but also the volatility of its business model.      The exchange reported $1.8 billion in revenue for the quarter (versus $1.27 billion for the full year 2020). Coinbase gave no revenue guidance (as a publicly traded company normally would), but instead gave scenarios for user growth depending on different outcomes in the crypto market. It reported 6.1 million active users in the first quarter, more than double the number during the final quarter of 2020.      Some industry analysts were skeptical of Coinbase's sky-high valuation.      ""It does seem difficult to justify these numbers,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics. ""There is the old saying that in a gold rush, the ones who make the most money are the guys selling picks and shovels. This certainly applies to Coinbase.""      Coinbase requires investors to not only have a view on the future of bitcoin but also on other crypto exchanges and decentralized exchanges that will be competing with it for market share, Duke’s Harvey said. (The Duke University endowment was an early investor in Coinbase.)      “To simply extrapolate from past results ignores the competition,” Harvey said. “Most people are operating in the world of centralized finance and DeFi is not just a novel cryptocurrency. It’s reinventing financial infrastructure.”      While many equity analysts are looking at how Coinbase is turning its large pool of users into active users that trade on the app every month, some have said that COIN could end up trading like a proxy bitcoin ETF, as some investors are now possibly using MicroStrategy (MSTR) shares.      It also means that pension funds and endowments will be looking at other early-stage private companies in the crypto space that have the potential to follow Coinbase’s growth history, Harvey added.

42386499,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTSuD,1618399800,Valid Points: Close to $9B Worth of Ether Is Now Staked on Eth 2.0,"The first quarter of 2021 has officially ended, and by most measures, Ethereum had an outstanding quarter.      The native cryptocurrency of the network, ether, outperformed bitcoin and traditional macro assets by a wide margin in terms of price, appreciating 156% during the quarter. Several ETH investment products were also launched, paving the way for greater institutional involvement in ether markets.      The quarter also contained several milestones related to Ethereum’s technology roadmap and the progress of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade.    Checking in on Zelda, our Eth 2.0 validator  Read more: Ethereum 2.0 Explained in 4 Easy Metrics    In the first quarter, the total value locked in Ethereum 2.0 more than doubled, rising from 1.5 million ETH staked to 3.6 million by the end of the period.      As the number of users depositing their ether in 32 ETH increments grew during the quarter, so did the number of active validators securing the network. The number of active validators crossed 100,000 by Feb. 27, and has since passed 118,000 as of April 12.      In dollar terms, total value locked in Eth 2.0 surpassed $8 billion in the beginning of April, just as ETH price broke past a $2,000 per unit valuation in the markets. This makes the Eth 2.0 network the fifth-largest proof-of-stake (PoS) network by staked value.    Not so fast, 'Ethereum killers'    In the span of roughly four months, Eth 2.0 has grown to be a sizable competitor to other more established and long-running PoS networks such as Tezos and Cardano. However, one important difference about Eth 2.0 compared with other PoS networks is that the vast majority of ETH supply is not used for staking.      Only roughly 3% of ether supply has been locked in Eth 2.0 as of April 12. Compared with other PoS protocols, which boast nearly 80% of their coin supply staked, Eth 2.0 ranks the lowest by a wide margin.      Why?      Because the majority of new ether supply is issued on a parallel Ethereum blockchain secured by miners and a proof-of-work consensus algorithm. Moreover, Ethereum has a thriving decentralized application (dapp) ecosystem that competes with the use case for ether as a staking asset.      For other PoS protocols, native tokens are used in large part by validators to earn rewards on the network. For Ethereum and Ethereum 2.0, ether is put to work in a number of different ways by users, dapp developers and, more recently, institutional investors.    More use cases for ether    There were several new use cases for ether that attracted the attention of deep-pocketed investors and institutions in Q1.      First on the list is ether as a medium of payment for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Buying NFTs with ETH has always been possible on Ethereum and had attracted mainstream attention to some extent already through the game CryptoKitties back in 2017. But the recent hype around digital collectibles seen in the first quarter of this year has reached new extremes.      Writers, artists, athletes, businesses and even robots have issued digital art pieces on Ethereum over the past three months. While the sheer number of people engaging with this piece of technology is significant, what sets this frenzy for NFTs apart from the 2017 CryptoKitties craze is the participation and endorsement from high-profile individuals and organizations.      One of the world’s leading auction houses, Christie’s, hosted the sale of an NFT for $69 million on March 11, and accepted payment for the artwork in ether. One day after this auction, New York-based news agency the Associated Press sold NFT artwork for $180,000 worth of ether.      Trading volume for NFTs overall has skyrocketed by over 25 times since December.      Apart from the growing use case for ether as a medium of payment for NFTs, we also saw the early beginnings of what could become an industry trend: ETH as a reserve asset for corporations.      Software firm Meitu reportedly bought $22 million worth of the crypto asset to hold on its corporate balance sheet on March 7. A few weeks before that, digital asset merchant bank Galaxy Digital launched an Ethereum fund for institutional investors. It raised $32 million by March from deep-pocketed clientele seeking to gain exposure to ETH without physically holding the asset in custody.      Finally, the last use case I want to highlight for ETH that caught the attention of institutions this past quarter is staking. As we saw in the Pulse Check, over $8 blllion worth of ETH is currently locked in Ethereum 2.0. That's compared with $2.4 billion in the beginning of January. In the past quarter, validators earned up to 0.25 ETH per month, worth roughly $570 at time of writing.    Institutional investors eye Ethereum    How do we know any of this has sparked the attention of some institutional and accredited investors? Well, because on March 25, an investment product was launched by staking-as-a-service provider Staked targeted just toward them.      The new Staked ETH Trust gives investors direct exposure to ETH and the ability to earn roughly 8% interest annually from staking rewards on their investment. The minimum investment amount is $25,000 with a 12-month lockup period.      According to Tim Ogilvie, the CEO of Staked, products like the Staked ETH Trust are front-running the institutional interest that has started to naturally spill over to Ethereum and Ethereum 2.0 in the last few months.      “As you see a lot of institutional interest in bitcoin, I think a very natural next step is how does Ethereum work? There are a bunch of investors who believe that the risk/return on Ethereum is significantly higher than that on Bitcoin,” Ogilvie told CoinDesk in an interview.      The first quarter highlighted several possible use cases for ether. ETH could be held as speculative investment, put to work in a decentralized finance (DeFi) application, used to buy a non-fungible token, staked on Ethereum 2.0 for interest or purchased as a corporate balance sheet reserve asset. Any of these use cases has the potential to break out as the dominant one for Ethereum and its native token ether in the coming months.      Which are you betting on to take the lead this year?
