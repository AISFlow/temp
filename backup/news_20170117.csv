42427256,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK17vh,1484694609,Bitcoin's Price Breaks Out of Range to Reach $900,"The price of bitcoin surged today, rising more than 9% and exceeding $900 for the first time in nearly a week.  Average prices across exchanges breached this level at 17:45 UTC, rallying to as much as $906.38 by 20:00 UTC, the highest total observed since 11th January on CoinDesk's USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) reveals.  Overall, bitcoin prices climbed into the low $900s after gaining more than $50 earlier in the session, rising to $896.75 by 08:15 UTC after opening at roughly $830.  By climbing more than 9% during the session, bitcoin prices broke out of the relative calm they had enjoyed for several sessions, when the digital currency’s price repeatedly fluctuated between $800 and $840.  New optimism  Yet, under the surface, there have been changes in sentiment.  Following the decisions by China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBoC), to meet with major exchanges last week, nobody knows for sure whether China’s central bank will take further action.  Such uncertainty, it seems, has given way to positivity.  ""It seems the PBOC is not going to do anything further damaging than limiting leverage,"" Kong Gao, marketing manager at China-based trading firm Richfund, told CoinDesk.  Other China-based traders, when surveyed, acknowledged that there is a perception the central bank will take no further action.  Fear and doubt  However, there were signs that the absence of any news has given way to speculation.  Rik Willard, founder and manager of Agentic Group, for example, theorized that the wider belief that the PBoC's actions may have been a way of the bank testing its market influence.  ""If I were the Chinese government, I'd be testing the power that my words (regulatory or otherwise) have over the global marketplace,"" he said.  Petar Zivkovski, COO for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, emphasized that traders are less confident than usual, a statement that is backed up by Whaleclub data showing the market is 78% long.  This compares to the three weeks through 4th January, when the market was at least 90% long during nearly every session.  He noted how this nervousness makes the recent rally vulnerable, concluding:  ""This price rise is fragile from that perspective.""

Backers of the event, runninghttps://www.interpol.int/en/News-and-media/News/2017/N2017-002 between 16th and 18th January, include Interpol, Europol (the European Union’s top police agency) and the Qatar National Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing Committee, a unit of the emirate’s central bank. The event is being held in Doha, the capital of Qatar.  Local news sources report that during the event, deputy central bank governor Sheikh Fahad Faisal Al-Thani (who also chairs the AML committee) called for more collaboration among law enforcement agencies worldwide during investigations involving the tech.  He was quoted by The Peninsula as saying:  “We expect from this conference to contribute in enhancing the capacity of the relevant competent authorities in conducting investigations in any crimes related to virtual currencies; and in establishing a network of practitioners and experts of this field.”  Interpol has held similar events in the past, and the organization has even created its own digital currency to assist in training exercises.

42427260,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK185h,1484682307,Estimating China's Real Bitcoin Trading Volumes,"Willy Woo is an entrepreneur, angel investor, derivatives trader and cryptocurrency enthusiast.  In this guest feature, Woo takes aim at the prevailing notion that China's bitcoin markets account for 98% of trading, suggesting that the real number is closer to 80%.      Today, China's exchanges report 98% of global volume, a figure that would suggest a huge dominance by its markets.  Unfortunately, we know that most of this volume is fake.  Unlike the rest of the world, China-based exchanges are unique in that they do not charge fees on bitcoin trades. Instead they make money via withdrawal charges out of the exchange. Further, these fees reduce as your trading volume increases, so this incentivizes traders to bolster this figure by buying and selling from themselves at zero cost.  Still, there's a ocean of data coming from the markets, and they hold hidden secrets.  In this study, I'll peer into the data and attempt (as far as I know) the first estimate of true China-based volumes using data driven methods.  Starting points  For this post, I'll define ""true volume"" as what the volumes would have been, had the exchanges charged a trading fee.  Prior estimates (really just educated guesses) have put Chinese volumes at 50% of the global market. Let's see how well this compares with the data.  To begin, we must remember that China was not always a zero-fee market.  BTCC, the first China-based exchange, started with 0.3% fees on trades. Likewise the second Chinese exchange, OKCoin, initially charged 0.3%.  Then, on 24th September 2013, BTCC instigated what was to be a three-month experiment in zero fees. This started an arms race between all the domestic exchanges, heralding in an era of zero fees from which China has never returned.  But, how do we know the effect this had on volumes?  For one, there was an immediate spike. Expressed as a ratio to non-Chinese volume, it went from 17% to well over 100% in barely six weeks.  This visualization is useful in one other aspect.  We can see China's exchange volume growth was steadily increasing at a predictable rate (of about 4% week on week) before the introduction of zero fees.  This becomes our first tool to estimate true volume, as we can use this steady growth to extrapolate what volumes may have been like had this trend continued.  'Legit volumes'  Now, there is one market in China where the volumes have never been faked, LocalBitcoins, a decentralized marketplace where buyers and sellers connect and trade.  Here’s what its volumes look like:  LocalBitcoins  was founded in June 2012, and you can see it gained traction rapidly. By Q4 2013, we can see it began tracking global on-exchange volumes quite well.  The exchange is also available in many countries globally, meaning each market has a ratio between “on the streets” volume and what volume their local online exchange is doing.  This ratio differs depending on local conditions, but the two will track each over over time.  This will be our second tool in our estimation strategy.  We can use LocalBitcoin's volume to show local market demand, and scale it up to estimate exchange volumes.  Putting it together  We are now ready to reconstruct real Chinese exchange volume.  The historical estimates has three phases:  Real Chinese volume before the zero fees era  Chinese volumes were in a predictable growth pattern prior to the zero fees era, so we can extrapolate the growth for long enough to get us to the next phase  Once LocalBitcoins entered the picture, and was given enough time for it to gain adoption, we can scale up its volumes to estimate what the exchanges should have been doing as the two are tightly correlated.  The final composite looks like this:  From this composite, we can reconstruct the true global market volume.  Here's the estimated true volume vs the reported volume. The differences are significant:  Expressed as Chinese marketshare of global exchange volume, it looks like this:  ￼  Expressed as a ratio of fake volumes to true volumes, it looks like this:  Yes, it's been almost 40x overreported at times.  Still dominant  Previous educated guesses have put the real marketshare at 50%, but the data implies it's much higher, around 85%.  China is still the dominant players controlling bitcoin volume, but not nearly as dominant as reported volumes suggest, about 10-40x less dominant, depending on the week.  Data from CoinDesk Research, for example, based on publicly available data, indicates the reported figure to be 95%.  It's also worth mentioning that exchange volume doesn't make up as much of global bitcoin trade as one might assume.  The exchanges may set the prices, but most of the volume happens off exchanges in over-the-counter trades, so true globally traded volume is (supposedly) hidden.  Using similar methods to these here, I can probably make an estimate of OTC trade, but I'll leave that to another day.  Visit Woo's blog to read more cryptocurrency markets coverage.

42427243,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK17Th,1484676041,Bitcoin Exchange Coinbase Receives New York BitLicense,"The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has awarded cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase a formal license to do business in the state.  Though Coinbase has been allowed to serve New York customers under a safe-harbor provision while the application process was being conducted, the formal award of the so-called ""BitLicense"" solidifies the exchange's operating status.  Coming at a time when the exchange has been waging what could be an expensive legal battle with the IRS to protect its customer data, the license is being described as a ""validation"" of Coinbase’s aim to be compliant with regulatory considerations.  Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said in a statement:  ""At Coinbase, our first priority is to ensure that we operate the most secure and compliant digital currency exchange in the world. We're thrilled to have obtained the BitLicense and look forward to expanding our business in New York.""  The license was granted after a ""comprehensive"" review of Coinbase’s anti-money laundering, capitalization, consumer protection and cybersecurity policies, according to a statement provided to CoinDesk by the NYDFS.  The company will be subject to ongoing supervision by the regulator.  San Franscico-based Coinbase is one of the most heavily funded startups in the industry, having raised $117m in venture capital.  Adding to history  Formally released  in June 2015, the BitLicense was designed to provide a framework for companies looking to custody bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for their customers or trade the cryptocurrency.  However, after an initial 22 applications were sent in, the controversial license proved too expensive for many startups. In fact, this is only the third BitLicense to be awarded to date, with multiple applications have been denied.  In September 2015, Boston-based Circle was granted the first BitLicense, though by December 2016 the company had pivoted away from its bitcoin exchange to focus more on payments.  Last July, San Francisco-based Ripple was awarded the second BitLicense.  In addition to the BitLicense, the NYDFS has granted banking charters to bitcoin startups Gemini Trust Company and itBit Trust Company.  Financial Services Superintendent Vullo concluded in the statement:  ""New York is committed to fostering and encouraging the long-term growth of new industries throughout the state while enforcing all necessary safeguards to protect our markets and consumers.""

42427252,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK17ph,1484671284,Bitcoin Startup SatoshiPay Nets €640k in New Funding,"Bitcoin micropayments startup SatoshiPay has secured nearly $700k in new capital as part of a broader fundraising effort.  Blue Star Capital announced this week that it was investing €640k (roughly $684k) in the startup. SatoshiPay develops content monetization tools for processing tiny transactions denominated in bitcoin.  According to statements from Blue Star, SatoshiPay is in the midst of completing a €1m funding round that, if successful, will value the startup at a reported €6m. The startup later said it expects to close the round this week.  The funding comes more than a year after the firm raised €160k, and months after it unveiled a new micropayments project with Visa Europe that connected the card issuer’s infrastructure with a SatoshiPay wallet.  Blue Star’s portfolio, according to materials published in November, is largely focused on digital media and services, including a biometrics-oriented payments startup called Sthaler.  ""We are delighted to be investing in SatoshiPay at this exciting stage in its development. We believe the market opportunity for SatoshiPay is potentially vast and we look forward to working with SatoshiPay's management to help maximise this opportunity,"" Tony Fabrizi, Blue Star CEO, said in a statement.

42427261,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK183h,1484661612,First Look: Deloitte's New Wall Street Lab is a Blockchain Playground,"Sitting conveniently between the New York Federal Reserve bank’s 500,000 bars of gold and Wall Street you will now find consulting firm Deloitte’s newly launched blockchain laboratory.  Measuring approximately 3,000 square feet, the latest in a planned series of such locations now offers a one-stop shop for the increasingly crowded field of companies looking to turn shared distributed ledgers into enterprise grade applications.  Staffed by a diverse team of blockchain coders, UX/UI designers, tax attorneys and compliance experts, the location on the 49th floor of a dark skyscraper is no accident, according to Deloitte’s head of global financial services, Joe Guastella.  The space overlooks the Empire State Building, Brooklyn and New Jersey, placing it not only a two-minute walk from Wall Street, but only a short train ride from Chelsea’s Fashion District, Brooklyn’s new-wave of industrial manufacturers and the shipping avenues of both New York’s East River and the Hudson.  According to Guastella, who on Thursday helped formally open the laboratory, the site was chosen because of its unique access to many of the 23 different industries he believes Deloitte’s blockchain products can serve.  In conversation with CoinDesk at the launch, Guastella said Deloitte generated a record $36.8bn revenue last year, and that it hoped to use the lab to stay competitive as a wide range of firms fight for blockchain dominance:  ""We want to be in the field with our clients. We want to be right there to make it easier to get here, easier to work with.""  Gathered for the launch event were about 100 people, including representatives of legacy banks like Goldman Sachs, industry advocates from the Digital Chamber of Commerce and startups such as Loyyal, whose blockchain-based loyalty rewards software was integrated into one of four proofs-of-concepts being demoed at the event.  Drinks and demos  Drinks and hors d’oeuvres were served, at this second launch of what the consulting firm calls a “Grid by Deloitte” lab.  The lab is currently staffed by 20 people, a number that Deloitte principal Eric Piscini expects will grow to 50 people by the end of the calendar year.  Many of those employees – selected specifically to help professionals build blockchain products in diverse industries – were on hand to demonstrate some of around 30 proofs of concept (PoCs) from Deloitte's ""library"" that was also unveiled at the event.  Four of those PoCs were demonstrated in different rooms of the lab, which is housed within Deloitte Digital, a practice that supports a wide range of consulting services, including behavioral economics, human design and a creative ad agency.  Demonstrated, was a trade finance application using the Nuco platform to simplify the way trade loans are issued, a cross-border payments application that was built using Stellar, a reinsurance application built using Monax, and a loyalty rewards app created with software from Loyyal.  Loyyal co-founder Sean Dennis says that since he and four other startups formally partnered with Deloitte last year, most of the work has occurred remotely or at different Deloitte locations.  But with the opening of the laboratory, he and his New York-based team believe the consulting firm has ""solidified"" its commitment to the blockchain industry.  He explained that Deloitte is now using the lab to pitch his and other applications to clients from the diverse set of industries at home in the city, adding:  ""The nice thing about that is, though it’s one application, it’s a nice easy way for companies to get to know and get comfortable with the technology with very low risk.""  Tech transformation  There's a catch, however: as more and more industries embrace blockchain, Deloitte itself is being transformed.  As a result, the firm – the revenue of which grew 9.5% last year – will likely look dramatically different when next year’s annual report is filed.  Even so, blockchain’s impact on Deloitte has been inconsistent, according to Guastella, who said different divisions have implemented the technology with varying success.  The most heavily impacted division within Deloitte’s financial services practice is capital markets, followed by banking, he revealed.  One of the fastest growing divisions, though, is insurance, which Guastella said was ""much less impacted"" six months ago, but is now being disrupted with services such as the reinsurance demo built with Monax’s open-source software.  ""There’s different degrees of how much impact [blockchain's] had based on different lines of business,"" said Guastella.  Among the least affected were the property and casualty insurance divisions, while some, such as asset management, are barely being impacted by blockchain at all. Instead, those divisions tend to focus on other solutions in Deloitte Digital, such as so-called 'robo-advisors' that use AI investing algorithms, for example.  Expanding the grid  Though the New York blockchain lab is ultimately to be part of Deloitte's 'grid' of labs, the network is currently more of a straight line.  The first dedicated blockchain facility was launched in May 2016 in Ireland, with similar plans to grow to 50 employees by the end of this year.  In the future, according to Deloitte principal and owner Eric Piscini, a location is possible on the west coast of the US.  Piscini, who also helped kick off the lab's opening, hinted to CoinDesk that Silicon Valley or another industry center on the other side of the country might be next.  ""The west coast isn’t as active as here because it’s financial services driven,"" said Piscini. ""But tomorrow other industries are very active, and they may want to be active in places other than New York.""  Ultimately, the next location will be determined by market demand, he added.  Blockchain fatigue  In an opinion piece for CoinDesk last week, Piscini described 2017 as a ""make or break"" year for the blockchain industry.  If real-world applications don’t start making actual industry improvements, leaders in potentially disrupted sectors could face ""fatigue"" and lose interest, he wrote.  To make matters more dire for Deloitte, the consultancy firm is relatively late to the game when it come to expanding its grid.  Last June, IBM opened a ""blockchain garage"" in the hip New York neighborhood known as SoHo. That lab is part of a network of 'Bluemix Garages' that had already opened across the globe. Then, last September, French bank BNP Paribas opened its own 'Innovation Zone' in New York City with a specialty in blockchain.  In fact, going as far back as October 2015, British bank Barclays had already opened its second 'Rise' FinTech accelerator, and even signed contracts with two startups that had passed through the program.  But Deloitte principal and one of the leaders of Deloitte Digital, Thomas Jankovich, told CoinDesk that considering the rapid rate the distributed ledger technology has matured, he and his fellow executives hare ""very happy"" to be ""late to the game.""  Jankovich concluded:  ""What we’re doing at this lab is we’re developing real, working, solutions, that have the highest potential for industrial scale. We’re not looking at shiny objects, we’re not trying to see if it works, we’re looking for platforms that work for a client.""

42427249,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK17hh,1484659986,Accenture: Blockchain Could Save Investment Banks $12 Billion Annually,"A new report from Accenture posits that large investment banks could cut operational costs by as much as $12bn annually by implementing blockchains in their business.  Released today, the report (co-written with benchmarking consultancy McLagan) focuses on the kinds of cost savings investment banks could potentially achieve through use of the tech to streamline various office functions.  Financial reporting expenses, for example, could fall by at least 70%, whereas compliance costs could drop between 30% and 50%, according to Accenture.  Overall savings, the firm suggests, could be between $8bn and $12bn a year.

42427257,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK17xh,1484657503,"Miami's Third Bitcoin Hackathon Was All (OK, Mostly) Fun And Games","Gamification took center stage at the third annual Miami Bitcoin Hackathon this week, with the first place winner demonstrating a Pokemon Go-inspired, location-based game that earned its team a 15 BTC grand prize.  Using GPS and BLE technology, the BitTag app facilitates virtual games of ""tag"" based on distance, rewarding players with small amounts of bitcoin while enabling local business exposure. The team consisted of seasoned developers who impressed with their ability to ship a working prototype.  Members included David Hartmann, Emanuel Guerrero, Rob Doischen, Ryan Pineo and Vasilii Muravev.  Discussing the effort, Hartmann, team lead and CEO of development firm The SilverLogic, told CoinDesk:  ""We wanted a fun and simple way to get people into bitcoin.""  Judges included Bitstop ATM co-founder Doug Carillo; Bitcoin Uncensored co-host Joshua Unseth; Satoshi Labs CEO Alena Vranova; Breadwallet CMO Aaron Lasher; and local developer and tech educator Nelson Milian.  Fun, fun, fun  The focus on making bitcoin easier to use was common among hackathon attendees.  Second-place winner Coinbar, for example, demoed an app that enables the querying of various types of bitcoin data using the unique interface of the new Macbook Pro Touch Bar.  The finished prototype could also be used to set price alerts, and the team plans on even adding on-chain bitcoin transactions to the app's future functionality.  Breadwallet's Aaron Lasher noted its potentially addictive appeal and remarked, ""I can see myself just messing around with this all the time.""  Other strong showings in gamification included Swolebit, which uses wearable technologies to track fitness stats, and help users achieve daily goals by rewarding or penalizing them with small bitcoin rewards depending on performance.  Elsewhere, Crypto Ranks perhaps attempted to take the idea of gamification the farthest by building a first-person shooter using an open-source gaming engine and assets.  Designed as a type of onramp for gamers attempting to enter the professional circuit, the game deducts a small amount of bitcoin for every shot fired in a multiplayer match and places it in a pot. At the end of the round the top performer wins the pot.  While the prototype was unfinished and unable to place, judges and notable attendees expressed interest in the unique dynamics the incentives of the game would create.  Big ideas  While a major focus of the event was adoption through ""fun and simple"" gamification, others continued to focus on solving hard problems through the unique functionality made possible with bitcoin's underlying technology.  Setbounty won third place doing just this with a Chrome app that interfaces with GitHub to allow users to place bounties for features and bug fixes in open-source projects.  Users can also set bounties for the same tickets, aggregating the funds and incentivizing developers to focus on the most in-demand requests while rewarding them for their effort.  Like BitTag, the Setbounty team consisted of full-time development firm co-workers, in this case, a team that had previously won first place at the Miami Hackathon.  ""Originally, we wanted to build it using a system of smart contracts… but that was pretty ambitious,"" remarked team lead and CEO of Setmusic Jesus Najera. ""With the current prototype, we're the middlemen, but the goal is still to build this out as a totally decentralized bounty system for developers.""  Fourth place winner Rigid sought to use bitcoin's secure and time-tested blockchain to tackle the clinical trial industry, which consists of a labyrinth of consent and other legal paperwork.  The prototype aims to allow easy proof of record using the blockchain to streamline the paper trail and organization of records.  Another notable entrant included Quick VPN which sought to purchase VPN uptime in bulk and sell it to users for flexible custom slots of time, say 15 minutes, in exchange for the exact proportional amount of bitcoin and a small fee.  Serious, too  But, if the event lacked for anything, it wasn’t lack of creativity.  Ask a room full of developers and bitcoin enthusiasts what the ecosystem's biggest challenges are and you'll get many answers, and even more possible solutions.  Attendee Austin Alexander, an employee at bitcoin exchange service said it best when he remarked:  ""Adoption is hard, and it’s not just one thing… there's been a lot of progress but bitcoin is still complicated and insecure for most people.""  Perhaps more essential to the growth of the bitcoin ecosystem than any one project or potential ""killer app"" then, is the combined efforts of many entrepreneurs and developers of different backgrounds contributing in their own small ways.  While it tends to be the fun projects that attract the attention and win the prizes, they can also distract from much more basic problems which continue to persist.  That was the goal of long-time enthusiast Kyle Kemper and his BitHedge team:  ""For people just getting into bitcoin there’s always this question of 'How much bitcoin should I buy?', and the standard response is always, 'However much you're willing to lose'. The problem with that answer is that it immediately frames things in a negative light, and doesn't give the newcomer anything actionable to do,"" he said.  Kemper's entry, Bithedge, asked users to enter their current or desired net worth, finding the equivalent amount of bitcoin needed to own the same percentage of total bitcoin wealth.  ""It’s a pretty good and achievable starting point,"" Kemper said.  Still, there was a feeling that the diversity in approach inspired by events such as the Miami Bitcoin Hackathon ensures that many paths are taken and use cases attempted.  Surely, this is a vital need for such a new and nascent technology, one where success may come from anywhere and everywhere.

42427259,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK17zh,1484654432,CoinDesk's 2016 in Review Reviewed: The Best of the Series,"Pete Rizzo is the editor of CoinDesk, where he oversees editorial production on CoinDesk.com, as well as the startup's research arm, CoinDesk Research.  In this final CoinDesk 2016 in Review feature, Rizzo teams with guest editor and author William Mougayar to recap the series, reviewing the best of what its 50 articles and 60 contributors had to offer over its month-long run.  After publishing more than 1,500 news stories and features, how do you sum up an entire year?  That was the tall task facing CoinDesk at the end of December, and our second annual Year in Review was our best effort to do just that. Boasting 50 full-length opinion articles from 60 industry contributors, the goal of the month-long conversation was to showcase the sheer depth and breadth of industry thinking.  From security to regulation to marketing and history, we strived to offer something for everybody. Armed with so many contributors, we admit we may have gone a bit overboard with the possibilities.  From listicles and best-ofs penned by CoinDesk staffers to sprawling think pieces, our year-in-review wasn't exactly light reading.  Kicking off with author and Guest Editor William Mougayar's 20-point deep dive into blockchain's burning questions, and ending with ex-Barclays blockchain guru Simon Taylor's assessment of 2017, there was plenty to see (and perhaps overlook).  At least, we were reminded to retain a sense of self-awareness and realism about the blockchain’s possibilities.  We'd argue each entry in the collection is worth its words (and encourage you to check out the series again in full). But as we officially mark the end of our run, we'd also like to invite you to look back at some of the highlights that still have us thinking days and weeks after their first reading.  Below, we share some of our favorites:  Ferdinando Ametrano – ""Why 2017 Will Prove 'Blockchain' Was a Bad Idea""  Love it or hate it, it was a capital-O opinion.  Given extra weight by his status as the former head of Intesa Sanpaolo's blockchain program, Ametrano minced no words about how he believes institutions have piggybacked off bitcoin's creation of the world's first 'blockchain' to tout technologies that are little more that databases.  While the verdict is still out on his assessment, Ametrano's piece was effusive in its praise for bitcoin's development team, level-headed about its challenges ahead, and most importantly, bold in its predictions.  https://www.coindesk.com/2017-will-prove-blockchain-bad-idea/  Jeffrey Billingham – ""What 2016 Taught Us About Smart Contracts""  It wasn't exactly for the 101 crowd.  Though one of the shorter entries in the series, Billingham's overview of how MarkIt has shifted its thinking on smart contracts was revealing and insightful.  In an industry where so much thinking occurs behind closed doors, Billingham's willingness to state his findings left a commendable trail of breadcrumbs.  Though that might be the wrong wording – readers will find food for thought here.  https://www.coindesk.com/2016-taught-us-smart-contracts/  Wayne Vaughan – ""2017's Big Question: Who Pays for the Blockchain?""  They say brevity is the soul of wit.  That may be most true of this submission from Tierion CEO Wayne Vaughan, a simple three-part examination of how major blockchain networks pay to keep the lights on.  Yet, while some criticized it as brief or elementary, the piece reveals itself to be meditation on immutability that's surprisingly strong given all the talk of mega-consortiums and financial collaborations. As its image alludes, getting a table for 20 is the easy part. The hard part is splitting the check.  https://www.coindesk.com/2017-question-who-pays-for-blockchain/  Gideon Greenspan – ""Why Blockchain Won't Be Connecting Banks in 2017""  With seminal pieces penned on privacy and indusry use cases, Multichain's Gideon Greenspan always seems to be a bit ahead of the thought leadership curve.  So, it came as a surprise when his submission focused solely on why he believes the number of true enterprise blockchain use cases is set to shrink in 2017.  Overall, his submission was decidedly downtempo. We wondered, was it a sign of technology or entrepreneur fatigue?  Either way, when Greenspan puts his weight behind a trend, bearishly, we would argue it bears consideration.  https://www.coindesk.com/why-blockchain-wont-be-connecting-banks-in-2017/  Angus Champion de Crespigny & Andrew Beal – ""The Resurrection of Public Blockchains""  From the original pitch, we had high hopes for this submission – and it didn't disappoint.  Though not one of the more visible consultancies in the space, EY tends to tread softly and carry a big stick, and the piece was a reminder of how much thought work it has ongoing behind the scenes – even as it eschews PoCs and PR.  At a time when many institutions still dismiss bitcoin and other open blockchains, EY's salvo was a rare entry that championed collaboration and open-mindedness.  https://www.coindesk.com/resurrection-public-blockchains/  Ajit Tripathi – ""A $2,000 Bitcoin (and 9 Other 2017 Blockchain Predictions)""  Boasting 10 predictions, Tripathi approached his piece more like an all-you-can-eat buffet.  Still, there was something refreshing about seeing a director of FinTech at PwC speak so candidly about so many subjects. From central bank blockchains to ethereum's inner-workings, Tripathi showcased just how closely enterprises are paying attention to the blockchain industry and its many experiments (not to mention the nuance and humor with which they can speak about them).  Varied in tone and expansive in presentation, Tripathi's piece is one that we hope helps encourage more free dialogue in the years ahead.  Juan Llanos - ""Preparing for Blockchain Regulation in the Post-Obama Era""  Not all updates are based on progress, though.  In his entry, Llanos reminded us that when it came to US regulation in 2016, it was largely a year of inaction.  But, it also noted how regulation is a multi-faceted undertaking, further warning about the potentially disastrous effects of flawed regulatory changes. Regardless, the Trump administration will certainly have a direct or indirect effect on blockchain regulation.  We should prepare to expect it.  https://www.coindesk.com/blockchain-regulation-post-obama-era/  Eric Piscini – ""Why 2017 is Blockchain's Make or Break Year""  It wasn't a pour-your-heart-out kind of read, but the catchy title summed it up.  In short, there may have been no piece that summed up more clearly how the industry (publicly at least) is looking to portray the year.  Is it really 'do or die'? Or is this just good marketing?  Time will tell, but like personal resolutions, every end of year, it’s easy to say next year will matter more.  https://www.coindesk.com/why-2017-is-blockchains-make-or-break-year/    **CoinDesk would like to thank all of our contributors for their thoughtful contributions**    Interested in keeping the conversation going? CoinDesk is seeking to launch similar short-run discussions this year. Email news@coindesk.com for more details.

42427247,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK17dh,1484652631,UAE 'Virtual Currency' Restrictions Cast Uncertain Shadow on Bitcoin,"While the world waits to see how the People’s Bank of China moves to regulate bitcoin and digital currencies, another central bank is quietly putting its own rules in place.  The Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) released a new regulatory framework earlier this month, aimed at providing a basis for the development of a new digital payments ecosystem as part of a broader modernization drive.  The framework, published on 1st January, applies to companies that offer withdrawals and deposits to payment accounts, debit and credit services (both retail and government), remittances and peer-to-peer payments.  Yet, buried in the text of the framework is the stipulation that ""all virtual currencies (and any transactions thereof) are prohibited"" for businesses that fall under these categories. In the framework, virtual currencies are defined as ""any type of digital unit used as a medium of exchange, a unit of account or a form of stored value"", excluding loyalty points and other similar digital products.  To be sure, the UAE central bank’s steps aren’t as direct as the ones taken by the PBoC, which has met with bitcoin exchange representatives in recent days and intends to scrutinize exchanges more closely.  But the framework indicates that applicable payment service providers (PSPs) in the UAE are prohibited from handling or conducting digital currency transactions – echoing, in some ways, a statement from the PBoC in 2013.  On the other hand, sources in the region say the wording of the framework leaves it open to interpretation by central bank officials who have broad latitude over the movements of money within the UAE.  Simply put, it’s not entirely clear at this time how far-reaching the decision may be, and such clarity will come only when the central bank begins to put the rules into practice on a case-by-case basis.  Sally Sfeir-Tait, a partner for Clyde & Co, who has a special focus on regulatory issues in the region, told CoinDesk:  ""What is being discussed now? Is it an all-encompassing prohibition of virtual currencies of any form, or is it only in the stored value and electronics payments space?""  The central bank release comes after months of growing momentum for blockchain tech in the region, both in the public and private sectors.  A state-backed development effort in Dubai has attracted particular interest as officials look to digitize a range of government sources, though the non-financial nature of those projects suggests that they will fall outside the scope of the UAE central bank’s framework.  No surprise  According to at least one observer, the move didn’t come as a shock.  Raza Rizvi, a counsel for Simmons & Simmons, who specializes in the region, said that the move fits with its ""regulatory style"".  Indeed, sources say that the central bank’s prohibition is in line with a stance that errs on the side of caution when it comes to financial monitoring.  ""While governments have a palpable excitement about the underlying technology and are 'digitally awake', they are not so comfortable with the absence of central control that comes with cryptocurrencies,"" Rizvi told CoinDesk.  Sfeir-Tait suggested that, in this case, the central bank's actions are largely in line with its mandate as the UAE’s chief monetary watchdog.  ""At the end of the day, the central bank's main objective is financial and monetary stability, and that’s how they’d be looking at it,"" she said.  But what about those businesses that could be potentially affected?  Ola Doudin, CEO of bitcoin exchange startup BitOasis, highlighted to CoinDesk that the regulation ""is specific to companies that fall under the new PSP licensing"", meaning startups like hers aren't affected.  Moving further, there are only a handful of startups operating in the region, with Doudin's being a rare one to focus on the bitcoin blockchain.  ""To date there is still no clear regulatory framework for digital currency companies and exchanges locally and regionally,"" Doudin said, adding:  ""We welcome suitable regulations by officials and we always strive to do our part to continuously educate and set a high standard for the industry in UAE.""
