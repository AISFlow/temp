42382481,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rqzB,1565300484,tZERO to Open Security Token Market to Retail Traders Next Week,"Overstock is opening up trading on its security token market, tZERO, to all comers.  Retail investors will be able to trade on the platform starting Aug. 12, tZERO CEO Saum Noursalehi told CoinDesk. At that point, the one year lock-up period for tZERO's 2018 security token offering (STO) will pass.  While the platform went live in January, only accredited investors – wealthy individuals and institutions – have been allowed to trade on it until now.  At the moment, only two tokens are available on this alternative trading system (ATS): tZERO's own private equity token, TZEROP, which was issued in the STO; and Overstock's digital voting series A-1 preferred stock, which was listed in June. The latter is the successor to the first-of-its-kind blockchain preferred stock the company issued in 2016.  To boost trading activity on tZERO, its parent company Overstock previously announced a plan to issue more of these digital shares to all its shareholders as a form of dividend over the next two months.  ""It’s a nice bonus to our shareholders and it serves the purpose of getting a lot of adoption on the platform,"" Noursalehi said, adding:  ""There is a lot of focus on liquidity.""  He reiterated these comments on the company's second-quarter earnings call Thursday, saying, ""getting that initial adoption is key, as well as getting additional brokers to the table.""  $10 million Q2 loss  Overall, Overstock is slowing its expansion of Medici, the blockchain investment unit that includes tZERO and several other startups.  ""We don’t expect to grow the keiretsu as aggressively as we have in the past,"" Jonathan Johnson, president of Medici, said during Thursday's earnings call. (Keiretsu is a Japanese word for a group of interlocking businesses.)  While Johnson highlighted a few companies during the earnings call, including Bitt, Voatz and Medici Land Governance, he said this did not indicate that the other businesses ""aren’t making progress.""  Rather, the different portfolio companies have been working with each other, he said, adding:  ""The symbiotic nature of the keiretsu model is really blossoming.""  According to Overstock's quarterly filing, tZERO saw a net loss of $10 million, more than double the 2018 Q2 loss of $4.6 million.  tZERO is currently working to acquire one of the New York Department of Financial Services' virtual currency licenses, Noursalehi said.  ""The New York BitLicense is challenging to get, we are working on it, we're hoping to get it in the next six months,"" he said during the call. The company's 10Q said tZERO's wallet subsidiary Bitsy, which is being referred to as tZERO Crypto, is applying for money transmitter licenses in the U.S.  Traders in waiting  According to Noursalehi, tZERO is expecting up to 50,000 investors who previously bought Overstock's shares to get on board with digital securities trading.  Although no sharp uptick in sign-ups has registered so far, the broker-dealer community got interested, Noursalehi said.  ""We had a lot of broker-dealers, about 30 or 40, reach out to us that want to get involved in this ecosystem,"" he told CoinDesk. ""We’re working on these requests. Investors have been sending questions as well. They are excited and they are trying to understand it.""  Daily volume on tZERO has been fluctuating this summer from several thousand dollars to $245,547 at the peak on July 23, according to the website SecurityTokenCap. Tokens that were expected to be issued on tZERO by outside companies are not here yet.  Earlier-announced deals with prospective issuers like the Dubai-based real estate firm Emaar are still in negotiations, Noursalehi said, although tZERO recently announced it's going to tokenize a movie by the Vision Tree company.  In the meantime, the company remains under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for tZERO's STO. The SEC sent another request for information in the May-June time period, Noursalehi said, asking for ""emails and content like that.""  The investigation, it was earlier revealed, has derailed the plans to sell Overstock's flagship retail business, CEO Patrick Byrne told CNN. ""That destroyed the auction. It's awful hard to sell a company when you have any pending SEC matter,"" he said.  Johnson addressed the investigation in response to a question during Thursday's earnings call, saying the company regularly meets with the SEC, but he did not have a timeline on when the investigation might conclude.  ""I have personally met with the SEC enforcement team. The SEC, good as it is engaging with regulator dialogue, will not put a shot clock on itself,"" he said.  Patrick Byrne at Consensus 2019, image via CoinDesk archives.  Update (Sept. 5, 20:30 UTC): Saum Noursalehi now says tZERO has ""not received any follow-up requests into the security token offering from the SEC since December of 2018."" The company, he said through a spokesman, ""routinely interact[s] with both FINRA and the SEC,"" so his comment about requests for emails in the May-June time period ""was likely referring to one of these instances"" and ""was not related to the SEC inquiry of our security token offering.""",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,"Anna Baydakova, Nikhilesh De",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/08/tzero-to-open-security-token-market-to-retail-traders-next-week,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/21fdd879112e403f89bd5d3951cdc871fe269388-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382493,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rrEH,1565299816,Israeli Cryptocurrency Traders Locked Out of Banking System: Report,"After being unable to deposit profits, Israeli cryptocurrency traders are looking for answers from banks and regulators.  Still unfamiliar with the technology, some $86 million in unpaid taxes on cryptocurrency trade earnings have piled up as banks refuse to touch deposits writes Israeli media Haaretz.  ""The tax authority is aware of the problem, but they say the ball isn’t in their court. I’ve tried working with almost all the banks, but the minute they hear the word ‘Bitcoin’ they freeze up,"" Gross told the Haaretz.  Gross said he has paid his tax bills to the Israeli Tax Authority consistently since 2011, but after 2017 things went sour with his bank. Israel currently taxes virtual currency profits at a capital gains rate of 25% rate for individuals and 47% for corporations.  The issue is not the tax authorities, however.  Another trader Haaretz spoke with said banks lock up funds due to anti-money laundering and know-your-customer concerns. Paying taxes with trading profits is made near impossible by banks not wanting to be mixed up in the emerging market.  In May, an Israeli court ruled that bitcoin is an asset and not a currency. The court ruled against the founder of DAV.Network Noam Copel saying cryptocurrencies count as taxable events. Copel said his bitcoin holdings were foreign currency and therefore non-taxable.  ""Zero Crypto Tolerance""  Seemingly, the Israeli banking industry is taking a risk-averse position. Speaking with CoinDesk, the Israeli Bitcoin Association's Legal Counsel Jonathan Klinger says all major banks operate under a tight cryptocurrency policy. Trading deposits are not permitted. Fintech firms working with cryptocurrencies are similarly blackballed.  For Israeli policy advocates, the core issue remains in question. While some blame policy, Klinger says its in bank's interest to keep cryptocurrency at arms reach:  ""[C]ooperation from banks seems almost impossible. These actions might have been made if the policy did not originate from concerns of money laundering, but in order to eliminate competition that the cryptocurrency world has with banks.""  Gidi Bar Zakay, former Deputy Commissioner of the Israeli Tax Authority and current Bittax CEO, says the banking industry's pace is set by regulators. Without proper guidance, banks do not want the additional responsibility of anti-money laundering snafus.  ""In the past, crypto-related capital could be transferred to some banks in some cases, but in recent years, the banks tightened their self-policy on businesses or individuals operating in the field,"" Zakay told CoinDesk. ""They are now waiting for guidelines from the Bank of Israel.""  Retail banks are hardly friendlier, with 20 percent holding a ""zero crypto tolerance"" policy per Bits of Gold's Youval Rouach. The remaining 80 percent make the process a headache.  For frustrated firms, most are taking their assets abroad. Even Zakay's Bittax, a bitcoin tax firm, cannot open an account in the country. Zakay says many are sending assets to Switzerland.  In many respects, Israel's private sector acceptance of cryptocurrencies mirrors the larger Middle East. Regulatory opinion has often been slow to date, involving governmental oversight like sandbox programs. Cryptocurrency exchange Rain, for example, launched last month in Dubai following a two-year program with the central bank.

42382486,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rr6j,1565294424,Rhode Island Will Regulate Crypto Under Money Transmitter Laws,"Rhode Island has become the latest U.S. state to add specific money transmitter guidance for crypto firms.  According to a report published August 5 from Alston and Bird, an international law firm, any business that accepts fees for currency transmissions, or maintains control over virtual currencies for others will fall under the new law beginning January 1, 2020.  Part of Rhode Island’s licensure for crypto firms are strict compliance metrics, anti-money laundering and anti-fraud protocols, and security requirements. Firms must also demonstrate an operational ability to “protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of any non-public personal information or currency transmission it receives, maintains, or transmits.”  Many of these requirements are adaptations from the standing money transmission legislation in the state. What’s new is a firm must maintain holdings of cryptocurrencies in kind and quantity equal to amount being transmitter by clients.  In the bill, cryptocurrencies are defined as “a digital representation of value that is used as a medium of exchange, unit of account, or store of value, and is not legal tender, whether or not denominated in legal tender.”  Outside the purview of the law are digital currencies that are not exchangeable for fiat, or that exist solely on a gaming or blockchain platform. This stands in line with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s recent decision that enables an ERC-20 token to be legally sold on a gaming startup’s blockchain.  Additional licensing exemptions exist for “personal, family, or household” uses of virtual currencies, academic purposes, and certain escrow services, among others.

This represents the fourth emergency action taken against a cryptocurrency firm since the Enforcement Division of the State Securities Board restarted a sweeping investigation of the industry in June.  According to a statement published August 7, the New York-based Forex and Bitcoin Trader advertised 900 percent gains for two week investments. The firm stated a $2,000 investment in cryptocurrencies, foreign currencies, or commodity-based derivatives would see returns of $20,000, not including fees, through their guidance.  The firm also claimed to be a licensed broker-dealer with an insurance policy and sufficient capital to guarantee returns.  Investigators found the company is not registered as either a dealer or agent with the state’s Securities Commissioner. Additionally, the firm had not supplied information regarding its purported insurance policy.  The Securities Board first launched a regulatory sweep of the crypto industry amid the market exuberance of late 2017. Though the pace of emergency actions slowed in the following year, the watchdog has found ""the number of suspect cryptocurrency offerings being promoted to Texas investors increase along with the run-up in the price of cryptocurrencies and volatility in the cryptocurrency markets.""  To date, the agency has filed 24 administrative orders involving 62 individuals and entities, including an Australia-based cloud mining firm, a faux crypto exchange, and a crypto promoter who duped investors with falsified endorsements from the likes of Jennifer Anniston, Prince Charles, and former Finland prime minister Matti Vanhanen.

42382500,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rrN5,1565286027,Bitcoin Outshines Gold Amid Risk Aversion in Financial Markets,"Bitcoin is outperforming gold amid heightened uncertainty in the global markets.  The world's most valuable cryptocurrency is currently trading at $11,700, representing 16 percent gains on a month-to-date basis. Meanwhile, gold, the traditional safe-haven asset, has added 6 percent this month.  The precious metal picked up a bid at $1,400 on Aug. 1 as the U.S. President Trump's decision to escalate trade tensions with China triggered a flight to safety. The S&P 500, a global benchmark for riskier assets, fell 0.90 percent on the same day.  The risk aversion worsened earlier this week when China began allowing the Yuan to depreciate beyond the major psychological level of 7 per U.S. Dollar.  As a result, the S&P 500 fell to a two-month low of $2,822 on Monday and gold extended gains to hit a fresh 2019 high of $1,510 yesterday. Interestingly, bitcoin also found takers near $9,900 on Aug. 1 and rose to a one-month high of $12,325 on Tuesday.  Bitcoin rising along with gold during times of stress in the global markets indicates the top cryptocurrency is being accepted as a new safe haven, according to CNBC Host Ran NeuNer.  Further, the recent rise in the leading cryptocurrency coincided with a sharp uptick in the S&P VIX index – Wall Street's fear gauge, as seen in the chart below.  Bitcoin does seem to have found some love as a safe haven if recent price action is anything to go by.  However, there is no long-run correlation between bitcoin, stocks and the US Dollar, as noted by prominent analyst Mati Greenspan.  In fact, gold and bitcoin have moved in opposite directions in the past.  For instance, BTC dived below the long-held support of $6,000 on Nov, 14, reviving the bear market which had come to a halt near that psychological support in five months to October. By mid-December, BTC was changing hands at 15-month lows near $3,100.  During the same time frame, gold went from $1,200 to $1,300 and further extended the rally to $1,346 (Feb. 20 high). Further, BTC remained in a bear market throughout 2018 despite the trade tensions between the US and China.  All-in-all, it is still too early to say that bitcoin has taken up the role of a safe-haven asset.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42382496,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rrI3,1565276427,Korean Fintechs Are Creating a Blockchain for Trading OTC Securities,"A blockchain platform for the trading of unlisted securities is being developed in South Korea, according to a report in the Chosun Ilbo.  The goal is to take transactions that are now expensive, slow and insecure and make them efficient and accessible to a wider range of investors. Six local participants are involved in the project, including Koscom—the IT arm of Korea Exchange—KEB Hana Bank, Hana Financial Investment, Daejeon Technopark, Amicus Lex—a startup—and an association for accelerators. They are aiming to have the system in place by the second half of the year.  The trading of shares in smaller companies is said to be a ""blind spot"" in Korea, as the costs associated with the securities value chain can be prohibitive for companies not yet large enough for the Kospi main board, the Kosdaq secondary board or the Korea New Exchange (Konex). To date, unlisted shares have changed hands in an OTC manner, with humans taking orders by phone or messenger and initially recording transactions on Excel spreadsheets. The process is laborious and subject to error, while most investors are unable to access to these brokerage networks and have little chance of buying early-stage equities.  This is seen as a bottleneck in the development of innovative companies in the country. They cannot cheaply and quickly raise capital, and if they do manage to sell stock, liquidity is poor given the lack of a diverse and active investor base.  The consortium assembled for the project believes that blockchain can help address the gaps in the market. They say it will allow for transactions to be made transparently and a record of these trades and the resulting holdings maintained in a stable, cost effective way until the shareholder registry is formally updated.  KEB Hana will handle escrow. Hana Financial Investments will provide support to the unlisted companies. Amicus Lex will offer legal advice, while the accelerator association and the techno park will do the marketing and promotion for the platform.  Koscom, which is 76.6% owned by the Korea Exchange, has been working for some time on blockchain-related developments. Last month it signed an agreement with Samsung Electronics, the three South Korean mobile carriers and two banks to develop a mobile digital identification system using the blockchain. In late 2018, it said it was developing a collateral checking system using blockchain.  The unlisted securities platform has been in the works since at least May, when Koscom received approval from the Financial Services Commission (FSC) to create the system under a so-called sandbox program, which allows for the real-world testing of innovative services by exempting them from some existing laws and regulations.

In 130 pages, Kik went point- by-point through the SEC's case, and Wu went through page-by-page and indicated which ones readers of her blog should take in, skim or just skip.  ""That's what I do for fun,"" she told CoinDesk later that morning.  And now Wu is once again employed to dig deep, into startups.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Wu has been named a principal at Notation Capital, a venture capital firm that invests across the technology sector, including parts of the crypto industry.  Founded by Nicholas Chirls and Alex Lines, Brooklyn, N.Y.-based Notation invests based on its teams' areas of interest, which has included several blockchain-related investments, such as Filecoin, Livepeer and Bison Trails, to name a few. Notation is also known for investing in the very early stages of a company or project.  In a draft blog post shared with CoinDesk in advance, the company writes:  ""We weren’t hiring for this role – and then we met Katherine. For anyone that’s been fortunate enough to spend some time with K-Wu, it’s clear within minutes that she has a unique talent to bring people together, ask the right questions, and then get shit done in a way that is very much her own.""  Last month, the firm hired crypto mining veteran Thomas Bailey. Wu makes it a team of four.  Down the rabbit hole  A graduate of the Cardozo School of Law in New York, Wu discovered crypto while studying to be a securities attorney.  ""I fell into crypto first and then fell in love with the tech world later, which I feel like is the opposite of most people,"" Wu said. ""When I first got into crypto was when SAFT was starting to become a thing and ICOs were starting to become a thing.""  The legal questions raised by those token sales interested her first, but then she became more interested in the technology. ""It was simply the most intellectually challenging topic I'd ever come across,"" Wu said. ""You're constantly being questioned on every assumption you make.""  She was a member of the founding team at Messari, where she served as director of business development before leaving the crypto data firm in March.  While Wu will not be exclusively crypto-focused at Notation, she does expect to help the company source some of those deals. She's reluctant to identify specific areas of the industry she's on the lookout for.  ""Because of how quickly the landscape changes and how quickly your assumption changes, it's sometimes hard to hold onto one cool idea at a time and look at it on a long term horizon,"" Wu said, concluding:  ""It's definitely really exciting for me to be given this role to write checks and support businesses if I really feel strongly about that.""

Calling it a ""concrete pilot project,"" the German bank worked together with its incubator research and development unit and Daimler Trucks on the system that it said ""deals with fully automated payment processing of charges between a tank charging station for electricity and a lorry system.""  The partners have already proved the system works, according to an announcement on Thurday. In test transactions, Commerzbank put euros on the blockchain system and and sent it to Daimler Trucks for the settlement of the payment.  The bank doesn't explain much of the detail, however, for example how euros are transacted on the system or how the charging station would receive and process the payment.  It does say that, as machines are becoming ""increasingly interconnected and increasingly autonomous,"" there's a growing need to allow mutual settlement with ""no payment triggering by a human actor.""  ""Current payment systems can not yet map such a fully automated payment process,"" the bank said.  According to Stephan Müller, divisional board member of transaction banking at Commerzbank, the new blockchain platform is part of his institution's increased focus on blockchain tech. He said:  ""Following the recent digitization of securities transactions and the use of blockchain technology, we are now focusing on DLT-based payment structures. As a bank, we naturally also see our mission as creating new digital payment architectures for our customers.""  Commerzbank said that the pilot has ""proved"" that in future the payment process for automated machines can proceed fully autonomously. The advance could offer efficiency improvements in the short term, it added, and also has possibilities across other industries where machine-to-machine communication may be applicable  Concept automated truck courtesy of Daimler",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/08/no-humans-required-commerzbank-develops-blockchain-payments-for-automated-trucks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/be0362180e6f1a4930b8e66310f4aeb19c697e6d-1000x577.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382501,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rrLp,1565262052,Bitcoin Price Looks Poised to Retest Highs Above $13K,"View  Bitcoin is looking north, with the daily chart reporting a bearish channel breakout following a six-week-long correction. A retest of highs above $13,000 could be in the offing.  The bullish case would strengthen if prices rise above $12,145, invalidating consolidation or exhaustion signaled by Wednesday's candlestick pattern. A stronger confirmation of a bull revival would be a weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $12,000.  A break below Wednesday's low of $11,388 would weaken the bullish case. That level could come into play in the next 24 hours if the symmetrical triangle seen on the hourly chart is breached to the downside.      The bitcoin (BTC) market appears to have ended its six-week-long correction on Wednesday, making way for a retest of key resistance at $13,200.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value closed just above $11,940 on Bitstamp yesterday, confirming an upside break of the falling channel represented by trendlines connecting June 26 and July 10 highs and July 2 and July 17 lows.  Put simply, Wednesday's UTC close confirmed an end of the pullback from the June 26 high of $13,880 and a revival of the bull market.  Hence, the doors look open for a rise to $13,200 – a bearish lower high created on July 10.  So far, however, BTC has not been able to capitalize on the bull breakout. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $11,850 on Bitstamp, having hit a high of $12,031 earlier today.  Traders may want to see BTC settle above $12,000 before hitting the market with fresh bids. After all, the cryptocurrency has repeatedly failed to hold onto gains above $12,000 in the last six weeks, as discussed yesterday.  Daily chart  The bearish channel breakout indicates the path of least resistance is to the higher side.  The breakout would gain credence if prices clear Wednesday's high of $12,145. That would invalidate exhaustion or mark an upside break of consolidation represented by yesterday's inside bar pattern.  An inside bar occurs when the high and low of a candlestick falls within the preceding day's price action. Essentially, it represents consolidation after a big move (or bull exhaustion).  The bullish case put forward by the channel breakout would be invalidated if BTC prints a UTC close below the inside bar's low of $11,388. That would confirm a bearish inside bar reversal and allow a deeper drop toward $10,000.  Crypto trader and analyst Josh Rager argued on Twitter ""it's far riskier being bearish at this point in time,"" suggesting only a break below $11,000 would shift risk in favor of a drop to $9,000.  BTC has carved out a symmetrical triangle (narrowing price range) on the hourly chart.  A move above the upper edge of the symmetrical triangle, currently at $12,000, would imply a continuation of the rally from lows near $9,100 seen on July 28.  Symmetrical triangle breakdown, if confirmed with a move below $11,693, would expose support at $11,388 (the inside bar's low).

After an investigation by the Financial and Cyber Crime Group, State Crime Command, detectives allege that three men and two women duped over 100 investors into handing over A$2.7 million (around US$1.83 million) believing that they were generating significant profit.  That was not the case, however, according to a warning from Queensland police on Thursday.  From 2017, victims were said to have been persuaded to invest cryptocurrency in a legitimate-seeming firm called Exmount Holdings Group, which had a website, call center and sales staff.  The victims were allegedly lured into making a trial investment, with promises of high returns after they had invested more funds. They were provided website accounts where they could monitor the growth of their investment over the trial period.  Detective Superintendent Terry Lawrence of the Financial and Cyber Crime Group, said:  “When victims attempted to withdraw their capital, they could not. Their money had gone and any attempt they made to contact one of the companies or their staff was unsuccessful.”  Other entities and websites alleged to have been linked to the fraudulent scheme included ""Exmount Holdings Ltd,"" ""The Quid Pro Quo Foundation,"" ""The Atlas Group,"" ""AFG Associates Pty Ltd,"" ""tradex123,"" ""exmounttrading,"" ""atlasfxgroup"" and ""amazonqus,"" the police said.  The five individuals from Australia's Gold Coast have now been charged with fraud and money laundering and will separately appear before a magistrates court on 9 August, 22 August and 5 November.

42382490,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rrBl,1565227800,State-Sponsored Chinese Hacking Group Targeting Crypto Firms: Report,"A Chinese espionage operator is attacking crypto firms during state-sponsored campaigns, according to a FireEye Threat Intelligence report published August 2.  The intelligence company “assesses with high confidence” that APT41, a hacking collective, has moved on from financially motivated attacks of video game companies to working alongside the Chinese government. The report was first uncovered by CoinTelegraph.  Reportedly, the hacker group “targets industries in a manner generally aligned with China's Five-Year economic development plans.”  In addition to targeted attacks of healthcare, telecoms, fintech, and film and media companies, evidence suggest APT41 has infiltrated and phished a number of firms operating in the crypto industry.  In June 2018, APT41 sent spear-phishing emails that prompted targets to join a cryptocurrency-denominated decentralized gaming platform to game studios.  The same month, a crypto exchange was targeted by the same email address, reportedly operated by one Tom Giardino.  Furthermore, in at least one instance, the hacking group deployed malicious code that uploads a monero mining bot on a target’s computer, in what is developing into a common form of cyber extortion.

42382498,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rrJJ,1565226058,Cryptojackers Making Secondary Income Off Security Data Seizures: Report,"In the wake of lower cryptocurrency prices, ghost mining hackers are turning to metadata seizures.  In a report issued today, cybersecurity firm Carbon Black says a well-known 2018 monero crypto mining botnet contained a secondary component capable of seizing IP addresses, domain info, usernames, and passwords. Dubbed “Access Mining,” Carbon Black researchers Greg Foss and Marian Liang say the 2018 botnet campaign has been collecting secret data for the past two years, making millions in the process.  According to reports at the time, 500,000 machines were trojanized with a monero cryotojacking mining protocol, XMRig, collecting 8,900 monero. Most infected machines resided in Russia, Eastern Europe, and Asian Pacific.  Unbeknownst at the time, the 500,000 computers were not only hacked with the ghost protocol but also data collection software. A patchwork of programs taken from open-source code on GitHub like Eternal Blue and Mimikatz implemented on XMRig helped the hackers innovate, the report states.  The hackers turned the security data into a secondary source of income. With one infected machine selling for an average of $6.75 on dark web markets, the 500,000 haul is worth $1.69 million. Infected machines can even be rented for 24 to 48 hours as a source of passive income for hackers. Depending on the machine’s location and owner, machine values can skyrocket.  At $90 per monero coin, the group’s assets sit near $3.29 million Carbon Black says.  Foss and Liang say Access Mining is more than likely the result of dropping monero prices following the 2018 bear market. Following their report, the firm issued a series of tips for addressing possible concerns.
