So this report will take a look at where the price of Dogecoin will realistically be if the meme coin’s market cap were to reach the current market cap of Bitcoin or Ethereum. Dogecoin With The Market Cap Of Bitcoin Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, has a market cap of $521 billion. This is over 2x the market cap of the second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum, and makes up around half of the total crypto market cap. While this is interesting, a more interesting fact is where the price of Dogecoin would be if it were to reach the market cap of Bitcoin. Related Reading: Ethereum Surges Ahead Of Bitcoin In Active Addresses, What Does This Mean? CoinGecko’s Coin Comparison feature allows users to input two different cryptocurrencies and show how much one would trade for if they had the market cap of the others. Using this feature, NewsBTC has been able to determine how much a single DOGE token would be at a market cap of $521 billion. DOGE would trade at $3.70 with Bitcoin's market cap | Source: CoinGecko A single DOGE token at such a market cap comes out to $3.70 per token, an over 59x (5,900%) increase from its current price. Inversely, Bitcoin at the $8.8 billion market cap of Dogecoin would put each BTC at a price of $448. Where Will DOGE Trade With Ethereum’s Market Cap Ethereum is currently the second-largest cryptocurrency in the space with a market cap of $196 billion. With this market cap, the price of Ethereum’s nice ETH token is sitting at $1,635 with a circulating supply of 120,225,429 ETH. Now, using CoinGecko’s Coin Comparison feature and checking the price of where Dogecoin would be if it reaches the $196 billion market cap of Ethereum, it comes out to a $1.39 price point for the meme coin. DOGE would trade at $1.39 with Bitcoin's market cap | Source: CoinGecko From its current price of $0.06192, it comes out to a 22x or 2,200% move. On the flip side, Ethereum falling to the market cap of DOGE at $8.8 billion would see the digital asset’s price trade at just $72.53, a long way from its present value.

42419583,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEza1,1695076323,‘I Just Want to Keep Things Moving’: Judge Makes No Ruling in SEC-Binance Document Dispute,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – A U.S. judge declined to order Binance.US to make its executives more available for depositions, or for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to back down in its demands for more documents during a hearing Monday.  Rather, Magistrate Judge Zia Faruqui urged the two parties to work on the various discovery requests together, asking the SEC to narrow its request for information but allowing it to depose certain shard holders to establish whether Binance.US’s funds are safe. The crypto exchange, a branch of the global Binance entity, should share more information about its relationship with Ceffu, its service provider, he said.  “I’m not going to order from the bench right now that they produce or not produce things. Let’s continue to try to work this out,” he said. “I just want to keep things moving.”  At the heart of the SEC’s argument is a concern that Ceffu is far more closely related to Binance Holdings Limited, its global entity, than is permitted by a mutually agreed upon order requiring Binance.US and its parent company BAM Trading to keep all U.S. customer funds in wallets accessible only by U.S. personnel.  Matthew Martens, an attorney with Wilmer Hale representing Binance.US, said the regulator’s requests for documents were so broad it would be impossible to produce them. “Chasing down exactly how that software works is neither here nor there,” he said.  Read more: Binance Is Supposedly Separate From Crypto Custodian Ceffu. The SEC Has Questions  The judge said Binance needs to provide more information about its current custody solution: “I think we need more than we’ve got right now,” adding as an aside that he wasn’t “super confident that BAM has total control of their assets.”  SEC attorney Jennifer Farer said part of the issue is “we don’t know what we don’t know,” in arguing that the regulator needed large amounts of information about Binance.US’ new wallet arrangement.  “That is foolishness. It’s not serious litigation,” Martens said later on in the hearing.  In June, the SEC sued Binance and founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, accusing them of running an unlicensed securities exchange. Since then, the regulator has been working to ensure that assets from U.S. customers would stay in the U.S.  The judge set an October 10 deadline for a joint status report and a follow-up hearing for October 12.

Will He Sell?,"An Ethereum initial coin offering (ICO) participant and one of the earliest supporters of the smart contract platform has moved 6,000 ETH worth $9.96 million to Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange, recent data from Lookonchain on September 18 reveals. The unidentified whale received 254,908 ETH when each traded for 40.31 during the crowdfunding in 2014. This amount is currently worth over $466 million at spot rates. Ethereum Whale Transfers Over $9.96 Million To Kraken The anonymous nature of public blockchains, including Ethereum, makes it harder to decipher the owner’s identity. Determining whether an entity or an individual controls the address is also more complex. Whale transfers to a crypto exchange are usually considered bearish since the ramp provides an easier swapping option for token holders to cash out. Typically, crypto whales have the potential to impact the market due to the sheer size of their holdings. Accordingly, their trading decisions can influence prices, increasing volatility. Therefore, the recent deposit to Kraken may suggest that the whale plans to sell, taking a profit. Related Reading: Coinbase’s BASE Shows Teeth As TVL Nears Solana On the brighter side, the whale could be moving their coins via an intermediary, in this case, Kraken, before transferring them to other platforms like Rocket Pool or Lido Finance for staking. In the current proof-of-stake consensus algorithm used by Ethereum, whales can earn annual staking rewards if they lock at least 32 ETH. While the whale can set up a node and stake, liquidity staking providers like Rocket Pool allow users to stake coins and earn staking rewards using their infrastructure. As of September 18, there are over 804,000 validators, that is, users who have locked at least 32 ETH operating an Ethereum full node. Cumulatively, over 25.7 million ETH have been locked. ETH Prices Recovering As of this writing, the transfer on September 18 is amid the broader recovery in the crypto market. Of note, Ethereum (ETH) prices are up roughly 6% from September lows. Overall, supporters are bullish, expecting more growth in the days ahead. The pump also means bulls have reversed some of the losses of September 11, and the current formation may anchor the next leg up that could propel the coin above $1,750, or August 29 highs, and later peel back sharp losses recorded on August 17. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Metric Continues To Retest Bear-Bull Junction, Will A Break Happen? From the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, ETH remains under pressure, dropping 23% from 2023 highs of around $2,140. However, since bears didn’t reverse losses of the June to July leg up, buyers have a chance following the rejection of lower lows from around the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the Q3 2023 trade range. Presently, the September and August 2023 lows remain critical support levels for ETH, with the retest of August 17 lows on September 11 causing concern for optimistic traders.

42419592,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEzkL,1695072753,"Bitcoin’s Crypto Market Dominance Rises to 50% and It Could Go Higher, Say Analysts","Bitcoin (BTC) has been running in place for the last month – its current price of $26,700 essentially flat from 30 days ago – but its market dominance has been on the rise as risks rise for the rest of the cryptocurrency sector.  The Bitcoin market dominance rate, which tracks the largest cryptocurrency's share of the total digital asset market, rose to 50.2% earlier on Monday, its strongest level in a month and near a 26-month high of 52% reached at the end of June.  Taking a broader view, bitcoin’s market dominance was in a range between 39% and 49% for more than two years before it broke out to that 52% level in June after asset manager BlackRock’s filing for a spot BTC exchange-traded fund spurred hopes about unleashing massive inflows into the asset.  Markus Thielen, research head at crypto services provider Matrixport, explained in an interview Monday with CoinDeskTV that BTC enjoys more “potential buying pressure” from the ETF listings, while alternative cryptocurrencies – also known as altcoins – may be on the brink of breaking lower. He noted bankrupt exchange FTX’s token sales, declining Ethereum protocol revenues and upcoming token unlocks – which allow venture capital investors to sell tokens – among risks on the altcoin market.  “BTC peaked so far this year in July, while ETH peaked in April,” Thielen said. “All these [ETF] announcements haven’t really benefitted altcoins, not even ether.”  Macro analyst Noelle Acheson noted that bitcoin would likely benefit from the latest regulatory changes proposed by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYFDS) Monday, including stricter rules to list cryptocurrencies on exchanges while simultaneously green-listing BTC as a digital asset that license holders can list or custody without further regulatory hurdles.  “The immediate impact on crypto markets could be further rotation into BTC, as it consolidates its status as the ‘safe’ crypto asset,” Acheson wrote in a newsletter.",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | FTT | TOKEN SALE,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/18/bitcoins-crypto-market-dominance-rises-to-50-and-it-could-go-higher-say-analysts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cefe05422322c49313fda23bedd28668aa3eff14-5700x3800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While the market’s momentum has wavered for several crypto, a few resilient assets stood firm. Digital asset investment products witnessed a decline for the fifth straight week. Last week alone saw outflows amounting to $53.5 million, accumulating to nearly half a billion in aggregate outflows over the past nine weeks. Market Leaders – Bitcoin And Ethereum Feel The Brunt Bitcoin (BTC), often dubbed the “king of cryptocurrency,” bore the brunt of these outflows. Roughly 85% of the outflows stemmed from Bitcoin funds, translating to a decrease of $45 million last week. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Move: Crypto Analyst Predicts $45,000 Price Ahead Of Halving This happened amid Bitcoin’s grappling to recoup some of its prior losses. The cryptocurrency rose from a little over $25,000 at the start of last Monday to end the week above $26,000 by Saturday. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $27,117, marking an 8.3% increase over the past 7 days Furthermore, the outflow scenario wasn’t particularly rosy for Ethereum (ETH) either. Despite its traditionally appealing investment fundamentals, according to the report, and a booming demand for its staking yield, ETH also, saw outflows to $4.8 million. Other notable assets like BNB and MATIC also experienced minor outflows. As James Butterfill, the head of research at asset manager CoinShares, highlighted in their recent report, the last two months have been especially challenging, with eight out of the previous nine weeks reporting outflows. Yet, according to the report, the U.S. seemed to be the primary catalyst behind this negative sentiment, accounting for 77% of the outflows. Other regions, such as Germany, Canada, and Sweden, weren’t immune, registering significant outflows over the last week. Year-to-date net inflows have plummeted to a meager $51 million post this outflow spree, a startling revelation given the optimistic start to 2023. Solana, Cardano, And XRP: The Silver Lining Solana, Cardano, and XRP emerged as beacons of hope in this seemingly gloomy backdrop. Unlike their counterparts, these assets saw inflows: Solana led the pack with $700,000, followed by Cardano and XRP with inflows of $400,000 and $100,000, respectively. Their performance offers a glimmer of optimism in an otherwise challenging digital asset market, indicating that pockets of resilience and investor confidence remain. Additionally, trading volume surged by a significant 42% on the brighter side, rising from the previous week’s $754 million to $1 billion. While blockchain equities, too, felt the sting with their sixth consecutive week of outflows, the increased trading volume indicates the active participation and engagement of traders in the crypto sphere.

In the filing, BAM Trading’s lawyers alleged the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s document requests are “overbroad” and too much of an “inconvenience” for the exchange to honor. The SEC is requesting the documents to build its case against BAM (the operating company for Binance.US), which it sued in June for allegedly operating an unregistered securities exchange.  “BAM objects to the [SEC’s] requests to the extent that they are vague, ambiguous, overbroad, lacking in particularity or oppressive,” BAM’s lawyers wrote in the filing.  The SEC has requested a wide range of documents from BAM, from records of the company’s handling of customer assets to statements attesting to the company’s reserves and general financial health. But, those requests have been duly ignored, the regulator alleged.  One of the requests was tied to the exchange’s alleged use of a custodying service called Ceffu to move U.S. customers’ funds abroad in violation of the firm’s agreement to refrain from doing so.  Read more: Binance Is Supposedly Separate From Crypto Custodian Ceffu. The SEC Has Questions  BAM’s lawyers, however, alleged those requests were “unduly burdensome,” forcing BAM to take on “significant expense[s],” according to the filing. In addition, some of the documents are either not in the exchange’s possession or fall “outside the scope” of what is pertinent to the SEC’s investigation, the lawyers alleged.  It is common for firms under investigation by federal agencies to deny requests for information on the grounds that they are too broad or cumbersome for their staff. And, while the pushback is not always successful, it can create significant delays in a case.  Still, regulators have not yet shown signs of letting up on their demands.

17807109,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551789,1695067209,"Incoming Milestone Could Be Very Bullish For XRP Price, Here’s Why","Since Judge Analisa Torres’s ruling back in July that programmatic XRP sales do not qualify as securities, the token has been on an upward trajectory in terms of growth. This time around, the XRP Ledger is close to another enormous milestone, which could spell good news for the XRP price going forward. Accounts On XRP Ledger Near 5 Million Mark In an interesting turn of events, the number of accounts that are present on the XRP Ledger has been rising rapidly. This has seen the metric barrel toward the 5 million total accounts milestone as it is currently sitting at an impressive 4,781,844 million accounts, according to data from XPR Ledger Services. Related Reading: Ethereum Holesky Testnet Already Seeing Issues, What’s Wrong This Time? The site’s data also shows other impressive metrics about the blockchain such as only 1,116 accounts on the Ledger are carrying a 0 balance. This means that only 0.023% of the entire XRP holder base on the ledger is carrying a 0 balance. XRPL accounts near 5 million | Source: XRP Ledger Services Of the 100 billion total XRP supply, 58,682,136,692 (58.6%) are currently sitting in holder accounts, with 41,306,191,412 (41.3%) still held in escrow. This amount held in escrow is released periodically and was designed that way to last until the total XRP supply is exhausted. Going further, a significant number of XRP tokens are also sitting as reserves (tokens in wallets that cannot be spent). The current Total Account Reserves came in at 47,818,440 and Total Owner Reserves is sitting at 13,608,012. How Will It Affect The XRP Price? The rapid rise in the number of accounts on the XRP Ledger points to an increase in interest from crypto investors. In this case, as interest rises, so will demand for the XRP token, which would, in turn, lead to a rise in the XRP price. Analysts have also been incredibly bullish on the XRP price. In one instance, a Wells Fargo Manager forecasted that the price of the altcoin could rise as high as $500, citing Ripple capturing the cross-border payments sector by 2027. Related Reading: Jordan Peterson Sparks Debate On How Bitcoin Can Solve Major Banking Problem Another interesting forecast put the XRP price at $10,000, once again, citing Ripple’s rising market share in the payments sector as a driver. A more conservative crypto analyst put the token’s price at $130 after it formed a rare triangle pattern on its chart. Despite these very bullish predictions, the XRP price continues to struggle at this point. It is still trading well below the $0.5 resistance which has become the important level to beat. At the time of writing, it’s sitting at $0.49, recording meager gains of 0.03% on the daily chart. Although there is a more significant 5.52% gain on the weekly chart.

42419584,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEzc5,1695067039,Can Regulators Ever Keep Up With Crypto Markets?,"The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) is setting out to tackle a massive regulatory object: How crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Gemini and others list – and perhaps more importantly, delist – tokens. According to a new public service announcement, the call to update the agency’s guidance builds upon and will try to formalize existing working standards.  But the move is much more than just government incrementalism, and could have nationwide and even global implications.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  My colleague Jack Schickler does a good job breaking down today’s announcements. In short, the agency laid out three aims: set policy so NYDFS licensees are more proactive in assessing legal, reputational and market risks during the coin listing process, update the number of “greenlisted” coins (today limited to bitcoin, ether and stablecoins from PayPal and Gemini) and open a public comment period for industry participants to say their piece.  While “just” a state financial regulator, whatever the NYDFS does often makes an imprint worldwide. Even in an increasingly globalized world, New York remains a main hub for economic activity and capital formation, and so the agency is a leading organization in setting reporting and communication standards that echo across the financial landscape. If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.  So too for crypto, in an interesting way and despite The Blockchain’s globalized nature (some might say “geographical decentralization,” but you don’t have to). Take just the NYDFS’ track record when bringing regulatory enforcements: a few of these cases have quite literally reshaped the industry, like in the case of Tether that reset the bar for stablecoin transparency.  It’s true the agency’s so-called BitLicense didn’t quite become the model for crypto oversight that its architect, the lawyer and former public servant Benjamin Lawsky, set out to achieve. But the collected bundle of rules, recommendations and guidance has been a major influence on the development of the digital asset industry in the U.S. – with many insiders thinking it set the pace for regulators to try to squeeze crypto inside the box of established rules, rather than address crypto’s particularities head on.  Its legacy is certainly mixed. It’s arguable the NYDFS has protected New Yorkers from countless crypto business failures and bankruptcies over the years, and especially during the year of pain in 2022 when now-defunct crypto lenders like Celsius and BlockFi imploded. These firms were barred from offering services in the state, and just anecdotally I know more than a few people who were attracted by the (now obvious) unsustainable interest rates, who are now thankful not to be a bankruptcy estate creditor.  But the highly restrictive Bitlicense system hasn’t always paid off, (even putting aside the hypothetical profits would be Celsius users might have seen riding the bubble up). Licensees including exchanges like Xapo, bitFlyer and the U.S. wing of Bitstamp, aren’t exactly known for their major foothold in the New York or U.S. crypto trading markets.  Worse, despite the fact there are only 30-odd firms with a BitLicense, it doesn’t even have a 100% hit rate when it comes to protecting businesses and consumers. The now shuttered Genesis Global Trading unit of CoinDesk sister company Genesis operated under the aegis of New York State, for instance, with seemingly no practical benefit.  Either way, measuring whether regulations are “worth the cost” is a futile act. Especially in the world of crypto, where all of the real use cases are essentially ungovernable and where all excitement takes place well outside of walled gardens like Coinbase and Gemini. Mass market crypto has so far come around on a four-year timetable, and it’s only during bull markets that centralized retail crypto lending, crypto credit cards, et cetera can sound like a good idea.  The reason why the NYDFS’s recent announcement could have a global impact is because it deals with whitelisting and blacklisting tokens and because crypto trading is a global phenomenon. In the grand scheme of token prices, it doesn’t really matter whether this or that custody firm is awarded a BitLicense, but it sure does matter whether Coinbase will list or delist a token (even if the “Coinbase bump” is today muted).  The agency has seemingly taken a special concern for market stability when it comes to delisting tokens. In the announcement, NYDFS Superintendent Adrienne Harris noted that on occasion certain tokens will slip through or change, so that if they were once thought to be “OK” to list now need to be removed without further damaging consumers.  To my mind, that seems challenging if not impossible – and not because crypto firms are unwilling to comply or that regulators are incompetent. Just in terms of market structure, when something is both globally distributed yet also illiquid (i.e. a cryptocurrency) it’ll be prone to price spikes. Token prices are abjectly tied to reputation and it seems hard to imagine a world where Coinbase being required to delist some such token wouldn’t be read as a death knell, if only temporarily.  Further, changes to how companies “self certify” the tokens they list may mean fewer bad apples get in to begin with, but when it comes to spinning up regulatory working groups and delisting coins with an “Department-identified weakness or vulnerability,” it seems hard to imagine The Compliant will be able to move quick enough to delist tokens that are actually a problem.  This is especially true because the process of delisting a token requires several steps to remain aboveboard, like announcing the announcement and giving the public appropriate time to react.  See also: Kill the BitLicense | Opinion  Take BALD, the recent pump and dump token that inaugurated Coinbase’s L2 network, which launched on a Sunday, amassed a market cap of over $50 million by evening and then popped the following Monday morning. How could a regulator predict something like that?  Well, the simple fact is that they’re not even going to try – instead they’re limiting their essentially limiting their purview to overseeing a supposed “greenlist” of pre-approved tokens rather than taking an actual swing at the on-chain tokens that pop into existence and can actually do harm.  By lengthening both the listing and delisting processes, consumers aren’t really being benefited. These rules will likely only mean domestic bucket shops like Coinbase continue to lose out to overseas bucket shops like Binance.  It just seems that, at least in this very narrow sense, the aims of regulations aren’t square with the realities of crypto trading. And that there’s a difference between good intentions and good policy.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/09/18/can-regulators-ever-keep-up-with-crypto-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ba7b94e75194bcc7a85a2fbe9f75020291208dd-2319x1304.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Open Interest Has Exploded During The Past Day The “Open Interest” indicator keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin futures contracts currently open on all derivative exchange platforms. When the value of this metric rises, it means that the investors are opening up new positions on the market right now. Generally, the cryptocurrency becomes more likely to display volatility when this happens, as new contracts usually imply an increase in the total leverage in the sector (“leverage” naturally being the loan amount holders can opt to take against their positions). On the other hand, the indicator going down implies that a net amount of contracts are either closing up or getting liquidated. The asset may become more calmer following such a trend. Related Reading: Jordan Peterson Sparks Debate On How Bitcoin Can Solve Major Banking Problem Now, here is a chart from CoinGlass that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Open Interest over the year 2023 so far: Looks like the value of the metric has shot up over the past day | Source: CoinGlass The above graph shows that the Bitcoin Open Interest has registered a rather sharp surge today. The main instigator behind this futures rush appears to be the surge in the cryptocurrency’s mark beyond the $27,000 level. Before this rise, the indicator had a value of $11.04 billion, but now it has hit the $12.81 billion mark, suggesting an increase of a whopping $1.77 billion (about 16%). This rapid growth in the Open Interest can naturally lead to the asset becoming more volatile, although it’s hard to say in what direction this volatility might appear. If this rise has come from shorts jumping in to bet against the asset, a further rise would result in their liquidation, thus fueling the price increase even further. If, however, the contracts being opened are long, then it may not end very well for the rally. The chart shows that the Open Interest had a similar spike back during the Grayscale rally last month, but the longs that had opened then had ended up finding liquidation, as the price had returned to lower levels. The funding rate, which measures the periodic fee that futures traders pay each other, may provide hints about whether the new positions are shorts or longs. The value of the metric seems to have been green in recent days | Source: CoinGlass As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin funding rate is positive currently, but it hasn’t changed much with the Open Interest rise, implying that long and short positions are spread more evenly in this increase.

LINK climbed to $6.83 on Monday, gaining just over 10% over the past 24 hours, outperforming the wider crypto market. Bitcoin also gained on the day by 3%. Fundstrat analyst Tom Couture attributes the rally to optimism surrounding Chainlink’s deal with the interbank messaging system SWIFT to scale tokenized asset adoption.  On Monday, Chainlink’s co-founder Sergey Nazarov spoke at SWIFT’s global financial services networking event Sibos. Nazarov and Nigel Dobson, banking services lead at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), dove into cross-chain settlement using Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP).  Chainlink and Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), which processes much of the trading in U.S. markets, announced a collaboration on Swift’s Blockchain interoperability project back in June. Chainlink's CCIP will enable complete interoperability between the source and destination blockchains.  On Wednesday, ANZ also used Chainlink’s CCIP to complete a cross-chain purchase of tokenized assets with A$DC, an ANZ-issued stablecoin tied to the Australian dollar. “This new development builds on the lessons learned from the recent Swift blockchain interoperability initiative and further showcases how financial institutions can utilize CCIP to facilitate cross-chain transactions across public and private blockchains,” Chainlink said on X (formerly known as Twitter).  On-chain data from spotonchain shows that four Chainlink wallets unlocked and transferred out 18.75 million LINK (worth around $117 million) over the weekend. About 15 million LINK tokens were deposited to crypto exchange Binance and 3 million were sent to a multisig address starting with 0xD50f.

42392575,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg8LRX,1695062222,What I Learned Managing a Crypto Fund for Five Years,"I’ve been running a crypto fund for 1,825 days.  Arca just achieved a major milestone, reaching a five-year track record of managing outside capital in our liquid hedge fund.  Five years in any other industry may not seem like a long timeframe, but in crypto we often joke that one crypto year is equivalent to five normal years, and with 24/7 trading hours, it’s not untrue. During these past five years, I have seen many of our peers come and go, leaving a bit of survivorship bias as it pertains to crypto asset management.  Jeff Dorman, a CoinDesk columnist, is chief investment officer at Arca where he leads the investment committee and is responsible for portfolio sizing and risk management. He has more than 20 years of trading and asset management experience at firms including Merrill Lynch and Citadel Securities.  As chief investment officer overseeing this fund, as well as three others under the Arca umbrellas, I experienced first-hand the evolution of this industry, through good times, bad times and constant innovation. The five-year anniversary provided a natural timestamp to reflect upon what I learned about managing money, and about the industry.  Here are five of the most important takeaways from managing a crypto portfolio for the last five years.  In short: Investing in these markets is very challenging.  Tweak assumptions and risk models  This perhaps goes without saying to any person who has invested in this market, but this is not an easy asset class to invest in. For starters, the frequent booms and busts creates a false sense of liquidity and an oft-inaccurate depiction of expected beta and returns. All risk models, expected loss provisions, and sizing parameters are based on historical data and correlations, which change incredibly quickly. There is a reason why most funds in this space are early stage venture funds, where many of these real-time market related issues are not relevant. For those (like ourselves) who manage liquid funds, it is a constant game of tweaking assumptions and risk models.  Interpretation over speed  Contrary to popular belief, just because crypto markets trade 24/7 globally does not necessitate 24/7 trading coverage. Overtrading every tick is costly in any asset class, and the additional hours of crypto trading often try to lure you into more activity. But the reality is that the fragmented, global investing landscape actually gives you more time to react to news and information. While there will always be bots and algorithms that react immediately to news, much like after-hours equities trading post-earnings, these initial knee-jerk reactions are often wrong. And since one-third of the world is sleeping at any given time, it often takes days for the true market reaction to play out. A correct interpretation of information is much more important than the speed with which you react.  Careful documentation is crucial  On the flip side, the 24/7 work-day does lead to difficulties not seen in traditional markets. In TradFi, even your worst day/week eventually comes to an end, giving you ample time to reset and think through decisions while markets are closed without price gyrations clouding or influencing your thought process. In crypto, these natural resets often don’t exist.  Take the events of Terra/Luna for example. The entire unwind of a $30 billion ecosystem happened within three days, with continuous trading and new information flow over this 72-hour period. We made decisions during this stretch that in retrospect would not have been made with more of a grace period, and we have since learned how to better implement risk management during a future period like this.  In hospitals, mistakes don’t often occur because doctors are overworked or tired, but rather because of improper handoffs to the next doctor who lacks that full set of information because the previous doctor failed to document fully. Crypto asset management requires similar knowledge handoffs and documentation.  Balance between short and long  In debt and equity markets, quiet periods of time (summer, holidays) often lead to slow grinds higher in price. It is expensive to stay short, and dividends and coupons continue to accumulate, adding more buy interest to the market. The opposite is true in digital assets. Since the majority of crypto projects accrue value through network activity, slower periods of time tend to slow momentum of an asset. And since most assets have no distribution of cash flows, the cost to short is minimal. As such, negative price action tends to be more prevalent when markets are slow, leading to difficult decisions with regard to hedging and long exposure.  As a result, active management continues to trump passive indexes. Rules-based passive index strategies simply cannot keep pace with the innovation and changes to these markets. Similarly, these indexes can’t take advantage of the volatility, which creates quite a bit of alpha. Over time, this will likely change as the market matures. But we’re not there yet.  Building a good team is fundamental for success, and incredibly challenging  I’ve worked for seven different financial firms over the past 25 years. I’ve seen thousands of resumes and have interviewed hundreds of people. I’ve worked personally in just about every financial department (banking, trading, research, sales, business development). If a TradFi Wall Street firm asked me for a candidate, I could find them one pretty easily that best fits their needs.  Hire people passionate about the industry  But what are the best attributes and qualifications for a research analyst in crypto? What makes the best Trade Ops person? Who is best suited to handle investor relations? These are still not easy questions to answer in crypto. During the first few years of our fund, we took what we could get – which is to say, whoever wanted a job. The pay sucked, the hours were long, and the future was very uncertain. Anyone who wanted a job in this industry in 2018 shared a true passion for blockchain’s success, and was willing to learn any part of the job necessary to succeed. Most people who joined this industry pre-2020 are still working in this industry, and their job responsibilities evolve in real-time. But in 2021, I could have hand-picked any person I wanted from every major bank, brokerage and hedge fund, who all had zero crypto experience but saw big money ahead. The resumes were pouring in. Many of these employees didn’t work out. In 2023, we’re back to the passionate souls who will do anything to work in this industry.  Everyone wears multiple hats  This is a very hands-on business, where research analysts have to test functionality of applications, challenge status quo financial modeling, and network live with other industry veterans at conferences. Traders have to navigate back and forth from US macro, to Asian currency markets, to crypto-specific on-chain wallet movements depending on the current correlation du jour. Back-office employees have to test new service providers every three weeks to keep up with changing regulation, best practices, and LP demands while navigating constant bankruptcies, closures and hack attempts.  The common denominator seems to be a real willingness to test new theses. If you give 10 equity analysts the same inputs, they will give you largely the same answer and will present the same homogenous modeling techniques to arrive at this answer. If you give 10 crypto analysts and traders the same inputs, they will most likely give you 10 different answers using entirely different analyses. That’s refreshing, and often leads to outsized alpha, but also creates challenges when it comes to creating a repeatable formula for success.  Trade ops is the most important department  When I worked at credit and equity funds, the back office was overlooked. They were usually young kids, eager to move into a “real” trading role as soon as they could. The job was basic blocking and tackling - make sure trades settled, make sure your brokerage statement was accurate, and make sure the fund admins did their job.  Compliance teams were there simply because they had to be – we all knew the rules, we obeyed them, and if there was any doubt we checked with compliance but knew the answer would be “don’t do it.”  We should be so lucky in crypto.  Trade operations is the single most important job in crypto. You have to touch the assets every single day, and a single mistake could cost the firm millions of dollars. As a result, not only do these need to be the most trustworthy people in the firm, but they need to build redundancies that can still operate even if they themselves vanish. Getting into a Trade Ops role is more glamorous than getting out of Trade Ops, and those who build their careers in this subset of the fund business end up learning the most about blockchain.  Similarly, compliance is not an afterthought in crypto. Unlike in TradFi, it cannot be assumed that your employees know the rules, as most come from completely different backgrounds than Wall Street. Constant education and monitoring is a must. Further, a compliance officer can’t just read the rules and assume compliance, since there are few clear rules to follow (despite Gary Gensler telling us otherwise). To do your best as both a fiduciary and a law-abiding company is a herculean effort.  The sell-side is getting better  In traditional finance, the sell-side offers a pretty valuable role. They underwrite new transactions, create novel financing ideas, advise companies on how best to participate in the capital markets, facilitate trading in existing securities, write research on new and existing securities, and pass along market color between participants. Both full-service investment banks and niche broker/dealers exist, but regardless of whether you use a one-stop shop, or piecemeal the services with multiple firms, the services themselves are all covered.  While the sell-side is getting better in crypto, it is still incredibly fragmented and many of these services still do not exist. As a result, fund managers are often on an island, forced to manufacture its own deals, structure its own financings, and do its own research from scratch. Written research from OTC trading shops has greatly increased in volume and improved in quality, providing a necessary channel check on the state of the markets. But the trading itself continues to be very exchange-based (black box) and therefore lacks natural axes between investors. Trading color about flows and activity has improved, but there are fewer market participants to glean information from. There is still no full-service investment bank, and in fact, true investment banking services for underwriting and advisory of token launches is probably the biggest white space going forward.  I’m constantly shocked at how few well-known Wall Street capital markets tools are utilized within crypto. Most token launches are doomed from the start. From low float / high fully-diluted valuation (FDV) token launches, to direct listings at insane prices, to poorly written tokenomics – token issuers (who are often developers and lack financial knowledge) continue to have to come to market without the assistance of those who know how to do this best, which subsequently leads to worse investment opportunities for asset managers.  Some service providers are getting a lot better, like custody solutions, OTC Trading and options liquidity. Still, others are getting worse, like fund admins and auditors, who in the wake of FTX are pulling back from these offerings.  On the tech and research side, it’s amazing that Bloomberg’s crypto services continue to be irrelevant. The coverage list, their index, and all functionality is still from 2017 and does not take into account how much this industry has grown and evolved. Fortunately, newcomers like Nansen, Messari, Glassnode, Dune Analytics, Telegram and others have innovated fast enough to take this corner, and we are grateful for these companies. It is entirely possible to run a crypto fund in 2023 without ever logging into a Bloomberg Terminal.  Overall, fund management is still challenged by the lack of sell-side tools. As the sell-side improves, so will the number and breadth of funds.  The investor base is getting smarter  When we began our fund five years ago, we knew the educational journey for prospective LPs would be slow. We were learning constantly as we invested, and doing our best to educate interested investors in real-time, but it was not practical to expect anyone who wasn’t focused full-time on this industry to keep pace. Questions from prospective LPs tended to focus more on how we invest versus what we invest in, and there was definitely a bit of a leap of faith by investors.  Fast forward to today and the script has completely flipped. LPs are getting much smarter about the asset class and the investment universe, thereby asking better questions. In some cases, the LPs now know more than we do as they are exposed to different areas of the industry that may not be in our everyday focus. That said, the amount of bad information that continues to flow effortlessly through the media and “influencer” accounts continues to reach LPs as well, often surprising us in regard to certain topics of interest that we deem irrelevant, but our investors believe are topical.  As investors start to become more digital assets savvy, they want far more control over investments and specificity has increased. Asset managers in this space have launched highly specialized funds based on investor demand including DeFi focused funds, NFT funds, etc. Many asset managers, including Arca, have started creating ""Funds of 1"" that allow for more specificity but provide the professional team to manage the investments.  In 2018, if you asked us, we would recommend going with a professional investor. But as information is more readily available and UI/UX of projects get better, we encourage retail investors to research and invest. However, to generate alpha where information asymmetry exists, it’s still valuable to have professional fund managers who can take advantage of the 24/7 news cycle, market volatility, and a murky regulatory environment.  Conclusion  Overall, running a fund in this new and innovative space has been incredibly rewarding, and we look forward to the next five years. Fund managers will continue to straddle the line between “becoming more TradFi-like” and adopting best practices of Wall Street, versus finding ways to take advantage of crypto-only opportunities (yield farming, airdrops, testing new applications).  The most important factor for success in the digital assets space is faith in the future. We have to believe we are at the frontier of building a new financial system that has the capacity to transform society. While we fully expect bumps in the road, and pushback from incumbents benefiting from the status quo, we know that as long as we continue to move forward, fight for the necessary changes, and adapt as needed, this industry will succeed.

Why A Bitcoin Price Surge to $28,500 Could Lead To A Crash","The crypto market is finally seeing some green during today’s trading session, with the Bitcoin price rising above $27,000 for the first time since late August. Similar to that occasion, the cryptocurrency stands at a crossroads, but bulls should remain cautious, new data suggests. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Metric Continues To Retest Bear-Bull Junction, Will A Break Happen? As of this writing, the Bitcoin price trades at $27,200 with a 3% profit in the last 24 hours. Over the previous week, the cryptocurrency experienced a 9% gain, with the rest of the top 10 by market cap displaying similar price action but lagging BTC. Bitcoin Price Fractal Spells Doom For Bulls Pseudonym trader Rekt Capital has been closely monitoring a Bitcoin price fractal, forecasting a re-test below $20,000 for the cryptocurrency. The operation believes that BTC formed a double-top price pattern. This technical indicator predicts downside pressure for the Bitcoin price. However, the spike in selling pressure seen in the chart may take some time to gain strength. If the Bitcoin fractal above holds accurate, and if the cryptocurrency completes the double top, there is a high chance of a brief relief rally. In this scenario, the price of BTC could continue on its current trajectory and hit the $28,500 to $29,000 levels before declining into critical support. The fractal could be invalidated if bulls can push the price of Bitcoin above $31,000 and into yearly highs, Rekt Capital believes. Other bullish scenarios in the long term involved a weekly close above the resistance created at around $29,000 and for $19,000 to hold as support in case of further downside. No Liquidity, No BTC Rally Additional data from crypto analytics firm TheKingFisher indicates that the current Bitcoin price rally could lose steam. As the chart below shows, upside liquidity for the current price action is limited. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin Price Up Today? BTC Climbs Above $27,000 On the contrary, big liquidity pools are sitting on the downside, waiting for big BTC traders to push prices into those levels. In the short term, $26,700 is a potential critical support in a spike in selling pressure.

42392582,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg8Lm3,1695059278,Binance Is Supposedly Separate From Crypto Custodian Ceffu. The SEC Has Questions,"This afternoon in a Washington, D.C., courtroom, lawyers will argue over a seemingly straightforward question: Is Binance.US a client of crypto custody provider Ceffu or not?  Regulators are concerned over the apparent use of Ceffu by the U.S. arm of the world’s largest crypto exchange, because they’re wary of giving a foreign entity control over American customers’ assets.  In June, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Binance.US, the exchange’s international arm Binance Holdings and Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao for allegedly operating an unlicensed securities exchange. The agency is now seeking to ensure American users’ assets won’t be squirreled overseas before judicial proceedings conclude.  As the case progresses, the parties are making claims that are difficult to reconcile.  ‘Not a Binance entity’  Ceffu was launched in December 2021, originally as Binance Custody. It rebranded in February 2023, with a new name inspired by Binance’s Secure Asset Fund for Users, which was in turn a play on the crypto term SAFU, or “safe,” and with a logo now distinct from, if vaguely reminiscent of, Binance’s.  At the time, the company’s users were assured that this evolving identity wouldn’t affect products or user experience – but now it’s at the center of legal proceedings, and the custody unit is apparently going one step further, claiming there’s no relation to Binance.  In documents filed in August and unsealed in September, the SEC expressed concern that Binance.US’ use of Ceffu could breach a previous legal deal intended to ensure only local U.S. staff have access to funds. That agreement prohibits Binance.US from using any other entity affiliated with Binance or Zhao for custody, though it can use third-party U.S.-based providers.  In a Sept. 12 legal filing, Binance.US said the SEC’s concerns are “much ado about nothing,” as the wallet provider doesn’t get control over customer money. Rather than distancing itself from the custodian, it said that Ceffu is merely the market name of wallet custody software that Binance Holdings developed and subsequently licensed to the U.S. arm.  Those claims appear to have been undermined by Ceffu itself, which in a Friday post said it excluded the U.S. from its operations, and that it “strongly reject[s]” the SEC’s claim that it provided third-party “wallet custody software and support services” to Binance.US.  Binance.US did not immediately respond to a request for comment on that apparent contradiction.  A spokesperson for Ceffu went further, telling CoinDesk that it is “factually incorrect” that Ceffu was provided by or offered by Binance or Binance Holdings, as it’s a “fully independent third-party technology service provider.”  “Ceffu is not a Binance entity,” said the spokesperson, who refused to identify themselves. “Prior to rebranding in February 2023, our entity was always run independently from Binance activities, and thus fully separate from Binance.”  Blurred lines  But delving deeper into legal documents suggests a different story. According to its own terms and conditions, Ceffu is known as Bifinity UAB. Bifinity’s registration in Lithuania – allowing it to provide crypto exchange and wallet services – is still listed on Binance’s website among the various regulatory recognitions Binance holds.  A November 2022 SEC filing describes Zhao, chief executive officer of the Binance group, as Bifinity’s sole shareholder, and says that two of Bifinity’s three board members also worked for Binance. A June affidavit filed by the SEC says the company is still ultimately owned by Zhao.  It’s just possible that Ceffu – after its February rebrand – also made a clean break from the Binance mothership, and that Binance.US has indeed had no dealings with that newly independent company or its products. A spokesperson for Ceffu would not discuss its current ownership or management.  But if Ceffu has significantly changed governance over recent months, that’s left no trace on the public record. The SEC, and indeed Ceffu's institutional users, could be forgiven for feeling confused about the company's exact status.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | BNB,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/09/18/binance-is-supposedly-separate-from-crypto-custodian-ceffu-the-sec-has-questions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/28864b4031f4e99c0b047c2557050e7890e04ea4-1582x890.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

17802237,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551759,1695056448,"This Bitcoin Metric Continues To Retest Bear-Bull Junction, Will A Break Happen?","On-chain data shows a Bitcoin indicator has continued to retest the bear-bull transition point recently, but is yet to obtain a break. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder SOPR Is Retesting The Break-Even Level As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the short-term holders have continued to sell at a loss recently. The relevant indicator here is the “Spent Output Profit Ratio” (SOPR), which tells us whether the average investor in the Bitcoin market is selling at a profit or at a loss right now. When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means that the overall market is realizing more profits than losses with their selling currently. On the other hand, values under the threshold suggest the dominance of loss-taking in the sector. The SOPR being exactly equal to 1 implies that the total amount of profits being realized by the investors are exactly canceling out the losses, and thus, the average holder can be thought to be just breaking even on their sales. Related Reading: Glassnode Co-Founders Weigh In On Bitcoin (BTC) Path To $30,000 Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin SOPR over the last couple of years: Looks like the value of the metric has been near the break-even mark for both of these metrics | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the bottom graph in the image, the Bitcoin ASOPR has been consolidating around the 1 mark recently. The ‘A’ in front of SOPR here refers to “Adjusted,” since the indicator has been adjusted to filter out the sales of coins that were sold within one hour of their previous sales. From the graph, it’s visible that the Bitcoin ASOPR has constantly remained slightly inside the loss region recently as it has been retesting the break-even mark from below. This means that the average holder can be assumed to be selling at a slight loss right now. The indicator has made many attempts to break into the profit territory, but it hasn’t found any success so far. Historically, the ASOPR has been inside the red zone during bearish periods, while it has been in the green region during bullish periods. An indicator that displays this relationship even more closely is the short-term holder SOPR. The “short-term holders” (STHs) here refer to investors who have been holding their coins for less than 155 days. As is visible in the graph, whenever the Bitcoin SOPR for these investors has entered inside the profit zone, the price has experienced some uptrend. Much like the metric’s value for the overall market, though, the STH SOPR has also been inside the red zone recently, with these holders in fact registering more losses than the rest of the sector. Related Reading: Jordan Peterson Sparks Debate On How Bitcoin Can Solve Major Banking Problem Currently, the indicator is once again sitting at the break-even mark. This retest could be one to watch for, as if a break is found, a bullish trend could follow, much like it did during the instances during the past few months.

42392556,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg8KCb,1695052961,"SEC Rips Into Binance.US Over 'Shaky' Asset Custody, Asks Court to Order Inspection","In a scathing Monday court filing, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) urged a D.C. court to approve an inspection into Binance.US, doubling down on previous accusations that the firm had failed to produce documents sought by the regulator in ongoing legal proceedings.  In June, the watchdog sued Binance.US, the exchange's global parent Binance Holdings and founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, alleging they ran an unlicensed securities exchange. The SEC's findings in the case so far demonstrate ""the urgent need for an inspection,"" Monday's filing said, as the regulator restated its worries about Binance's use of custody platform Ceffu.  The SEC believes Ceffu, rebranded earlier this year from Binance Custody, may also be serving Binance.US, and therefore being used to shift U.S. customer funds out of the country in violation of a previous agreement to not do so.  The agreement was entered into because Binance.US' holding company BAM Trading Services failed to convince the SEC that it controlled its customers' assets, the filing said, adding that such conclusions were ""undermined by BAM’s own documents and inability to keep its story straight, [which] did not actually establish that BAM exercised exclusive control over its customers’ assets.""  ""The SEC seeks an order compelling BAM to produce documents and communications concerning any entity providing it wallet custody software and related services,"" the filing said, referring to BAM's ""evolving"" explanations for Ceffu.  The regulator further accused the company of providing ""inconsistent representations about key facts, slow-rolled small productions of documents and information, and stonewalled on entire categories of information that would likely shed light on its shaky assertions concerning the custody of customer assets.""  While calling Zhao ""an individual who views himself outside the jurisdiction of any court,"" the SEC asked the court to reject Binance's ""half-hearted claims of irrelevance, prejudice, and burden,"" and instead compel the exchange to provide the depositions, communications and other information the regulator is requesting.  Meanwhile, Ceffu has said it is a ""fully independent third-party technology service provider,"" and not a part of Binance, although its ties to the crypto exchange remain somewhat unclear.  A hearing on the case is set to take place later Monday, at 3:00 p.m. EDT.

Coinbase’s BASE Has Outperformed Solana Coinbase’s layer 2 blockchain network, Base, has seen an upward trajectory movement since it was introduced to the public, outperforming some of the notable blockchains in the crypto market. The network is now drawing close to Solana in terms of TVL, indicating remarkable growth within the network. Related Reading: Ethereum Holesky Testnet Already Seeing Issues, What’s Wrong This Time? Data from DeFiLlama shows that the blockchain network now sits a little above $407 million in TVL, while Solana sits a little above $650 million in TVL. The uptick in Base’s TVL is due to the significant number of users and developers currently settling on Base for their decentralized applications (dApps) and other financial protocols. BASE TVL crosses $400 million | Source: DeFiLlama The blockchain network also managed to surpass Solana in terms of transaction volume and number of unique addresses. In the past two months, the blockchain network has experienced an immense increase in transaction volume and number of unique addresses more than that of Solana. Data from IntoTheBlock shows an impressive increase of 1.88 million daily transactions on September 16, 2023. Base’s immense increase in transaction volume and number of unique addresses can be traced back to the growing user base of Base’s Friend.tech, a social platform that allows users to buy and sell shares in public figures. “In just 2 months, Coinbase’s Base L2 has skyrocketed, topping the charts in transactions and unique addresses. Much of this growth is fueled by the new social app, FriendTech,” IntoTheBlock stated on X. Base operates as a layer 2 network on Ethereum that came about due to the combined effort from Coinbase and Optimism. Incubated by Coinbase, Base was created to provide its users with a faster transaction process, improved scalability, and lower gas fees. Currently, Base surpassing Solana in transaction volume, and the number of unique addresses is one of the most impressive achievements of the blockchain network, due to Solana being one of the most notable blockchains in the crypto ecosystem known for its speed and scalability. During the first week of its mainnet launch, the blockchain network also surpassed Cardano in terms of TVL, transaction speed, and number of successful transactions. The blockchain saw more successful transactions in one week than Cardano’s successful transactions in one month. SOL price tops $19.8 | Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview.com Social App Friend.tech Attributed To Base’s Achievements You can’t rule out Friend.tech when talking about Base’s achievement in the crypto market. The social app is well-known among users and investors and has become an eminent topic of discussion in the community. Related Reading: Jordan Peterson Sparks Debate On How Bitcoin Can Solve Major Banking Problem During its official launch on August 10, 2023, the invite-only social app recorded over 4,400 ETH ($8.1 million) in trading volume in just 24 hours after its launch.

42392564,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg8KHj,1695051268,Senator Warren’s Crypto Money Laundering Bill Builds Momentum as More Sign On,"One of the U.S. Senate's top crypto critics, Elizabeth Warren, has drummed up some high-profile names to back her crypto legislation meant to target money laundering.  The bipartisan bill hasn't yet made any further steps forward, such as an approval by the Senate Banking Committee.  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has enlisted more support from key lawmakers in a growing coalition pushing for a law to crack down on money-laundering and sanctions abuses in crypto, with new sponsorship from the top Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security and Judiciary committees.  Though the prominent Massachusetts senator is gathering sponsors for this latest version of her Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act, including Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), who leads the Homeland Security panel, the bill’s path toward passage remains murky, with a divided Congress heading into a divisive election year. Though the House of Representatives has made progress on two crypto bills, neither of them is a match for Warren’s.  Crypto lobbyists have been putting up a fight against the legislation that the Chamber of Digital Commerce argues would “eradicate digital asset innovation from the United States at the expense of market security.”  The wide-ranging bill, introduced in July, would – among other things – extend anti-money-laundering requirements from the Bank Secrecy Act to providers of digital assets wallets, crypto miners, validators and other network participants. One of its original co-sponsors was Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.V.), who has often occupied a middle ground between the parties on important legislative issues, and two Republicans also supported it from the start: Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).  Warren’s effort also has backing from a group that more often draws her ire: Wall Street bankers. That industry’s lobbyists, including the Bank Policy Institute, have weighed in with support.  While the bill may not go far this year, some of Warren’s money-laundering concerns have been addressed in another piece of legislation – an amendment to the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).

42392576,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg8LHH,1695049200,Crypto VC Firm Blockchain Capital Raises $580M for 2 New Funds,"Blockchain Capital, a crypto-focused investment firm, has defied the depressed market to raise $580 million for two new funds.  The funding is split between $380 million for its sixth early-stage fund, which will focus on newer companies and protocols in pre-seed and Series A rounds, and $200 million for its opportunities fund, which will target late-stage investments from Series B onward.  The amount raised suggests there remains an appetite for investment, despite the relatively subdued state of the digital asset market for much of the past year. After the crypto market declined throughout much of 2022, coming to a head with the collapse of FTX in November, digital assets have struggled to escape a narrow trading range in recent months after a robust start to 2023. Bitcoin (BTC), for example, has spent almost the entire last six months locked in the $25,000-$30,000 range.  Most of Blockchain Capital's limited partners are traditional institutional investors, including university endowments, private foundations, financial institutions, sovereign wealth funds and U.S. pension plans, the firm's head of capital formation Jason Di Piazza told CoinDesk in an emailed statement.  ""Additionally, we have non-traditional, strategic investors who are category leaders within their specific sectors,"" Di Piazza said. ""While these investors are generally more tactical in their fund commitments, the long-term nature of our funds lead to long-term partnerships that can help accelerate growth opportunities and improve competitive positioning for our fund's companies and protocols.""  These include payment giants Visa and PayPal who joined Blockchain Capital's fifth early-stage fund in 2021. They have yet to commit to either of the new ones, the firm told CoinDesk.  Among the recent funding rounds that Blockchain Capital has led are a $115 million Series C into Worldcoin developer Tools for Humanity and a $40 million Series A into crypto infrastructure provider RISC Zero.

17799273,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551783,1695048323,"Why Is Bitcoin Price Up Today? BTC Climbs Above $27,000","The Bitcoin price is sustaining its bullish momentum from the previous day. Today, it surpassed the $27,000 threshold, a level not seen since August 31. Notably, BTC recorded its first green weekly closing candle in five weeks yesterday. As of press time, the Bitcoin price has reached an intra-day high of $27,267. Why Is Bitcoin Price Up Today? One major indicator that has captured analysts’ attention is the rapid increase in Open Interest. DaanCrypto, a noted figure in the crypto space, commented on the Open Interest of Bitcoin: “Bitcoin Open Interest has been ramping up like crazy these past few hours. Up +$850M in hours.” According to him, this can be an issue if spot bid disappears which could cause for a full retrace similar to before. “This would then be due to underwater positions that entered near the top. If spot bid remains then these positions are obviously fine. Open Interest is now back to post Grayscale pump levels,” Daan stated, further noting the resilience in the spot premium at the moment, “Longs are comfy as long as spot bid is present.” Maartuun, the community manager at CryptoQuant Netherlands, also highlights the rapid surge in Open Interest: “Fasten your seat belts. The Open Interest goes bonkers on this break-out attempt. It has increased by $600 million (7%).” Related Reading: Jordan Peterson Sparks Debate On How Bitcoin Can Solve Major Banking Problem Interestingly, Coinglass data reveals that as of press time, short liquidations for BTC remain modest, with just about $20 million in shorts being liquidated. At press time, OI skyrocketed further, up almost $1 billion (from $11.04 to $12.03 billion). Renowned analyst @52kskew emphasized the trading behavior on Binance: “Majority chasing shorts aggressively from what I can see so far. Binance Open Interest: Binance perp OI starting to moon again with minimal price difference ~ big move brewing. OI up and insignificant change in perp delta (positions opening into price). Takers still aggressively selling into price, bulls want to see constant limit chasing on the bid here. $26.7K pivotal price for direction.” Ali Martinez, another analyst, pointed towards Bitcoin’s 3-day chart and noted a buy signal by the TD Sequential yesterday. “A boost in $BTC buying pressure might drive prices to the channel’s mid or upper boundary – targeting $28,000 or $31,000. Still, watch the TD Risk Line at $24,500. It’s the key invalidation point.” From macro perspective, renowned analyst Ted (@tedtalksmacro) indicated a correlation between USD liquidity and Bitcoin price movements: “If you can track/forecast USD liquidity, you’ll have a solid idea of where price is headed.” He went on to highlight a divergence between the rise in USD liquidity and the previous stagnation of BTC, emphasizing the recent shift which might be driven by returning liquidity. Monthly Close Will Be Crucial As NewsBTC reported, September is historically one of the worst months of the year for the Bitcoin price. However, this year could be different if BTC continues its trend of the last few days. Rekt Capital highlighted the potential significance of the upcoming monthly candle close for Bitcoin in a recent tweet, stating: “The upcoming Monthly Candle Close will be pivotal.” According to the analyst, Bitcoin often produces long upward wicks when it transforms old Monthly supports into new resistances. Related Reading: Glassnode Co-Founders Weigh In On Bitcoin (BTC) Path To $30,000 In simple terms, an upward wick on a candlestick chart indicates price levels where Bitcoin traded during a period but didn’t close. A long wick suggests a strong rejection from those higher price levels. This could mean that while buyers tried to push the price up during the month, by the close, sellers had brought it back down, leaving a long ‘wick’ on the candlestick. Rekt Capital suggests that these wicks can extend up to +8% beyond the candle body. The analyst notes that if the monthly candle close produces an upside wick of +7% beyond the ~$27,100 level, it could mean the price might go beyond the weekly lower high. This could be a positive sign if the monthly close remains above $27,100, indicating it as a support level. However, if the price closes the month below $27,100 after reaching higher levels, it may confirm $27,100 as a new resistance, hinting that the recent price movement might be just a temporary upward rally. At press time, BTC stood at $27,241.

Licensees would need to assess legal, reputational and market risks of any new coins, and they'd also have to set out how they would reverse the process by de-listing a token, according to the consultation, proposed by NYDFS Superintendent Adrienne Harris.  “Since joining DFS, I have made it a priority to ensure the Department’s regulatory and operational capabilities keep pace with industry developments to protect consumers and markets,” Harris said in a statement, citing a team of more than 60 staffers and over $132 million in fines levied on virtual currency companies.  In April, the regulator – which has previously sanctioned companies such as Coinbase and Robinhood – set out how crypto firms will be analyzed for money laundering and cybersecurity norms.  As part of the September move, the regulator also updated its list of greenlisted coins which licensees can list or custody without further regulatory hurdles – and which now includes bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), and stablecoins issued by PayPal and Gemini.

17798092,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551764,1695045609,Solana Seeing Dark Clouds? Trader Predicts Steady Bottom Formation,"Solana (SOL) has been making positive noise recently with a surge in its price. However, one crypto strategist known as Altcoin Sherpa on the social media platform X, believes that the euphoria may be short-lived. Despite last week’s notable rally, Altcoin Sherpa argues that Solana is still trapped in a downtrend, casting doubts on the sustainability of its current momentum. Altcoin Sherpa points out a critical resistance level at approximately $19.50 that Solana must overcome to change its trajectory. The crypto analyst highlights a concerning pattern: Solana has been consistently forming lower highs since reaching its 2023 peak of $32.30 back in July. This pattern suggests that each attempted rally has been met with increasing selling pressure, raising questions about the strength of the recent recovery. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Outlook: Could We See A 10% Dip Due To Supply Pressure? Altcoin Sherpa advises caution for those considering entering the market, stating: “It’s nice to see some recovery, but every rally in the last few weeks has resulted in just a lower high. Regardless, if you’re in it for an investment, it can’t be bad to accumulate sub-$20.” Currently, Solana is trading at $19.12, according to CoinGecko, showing a modest 1.1% gain in the last 24 hours and a seven-day rally of 4.5%. Solana Support Hinges On FTX Liquidation In the event that SOL’s latest rally loses steam, Altcoin Sherpa identifies the $14 level as a potential support zone. However, he underscores a crucial factor that could influence Solana’s fate in the short term—the imminent liquidation of a massive Solana stash held by the troubled crypto exchange FTX, amounting to a staggering $1.16 billion. The outcome of this liquidation could significantly impact Solana’s price stability. SOL market cap currently at $8.08 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Supporting Altcoin Sherpa’s bearish outlook is an analysis of key technical indicators. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is indicating a decline in momentum, hinting at a potential downturn for Solana. Furthermore, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) has ventured into the negative territory, providing additional validation for the bearish sentiment. Related Reading: Toncoin Shatters Bearish Predictions With 40% Rally – What’s The Story? If selling pressure continues to intensify, Solana’s price could test the psychological level of $18.00, hovering around the midline of its current trading channel. In a more dire scenario, SOL could plunge even further to reach the lower boundary of the channel at $17.29. The quantity of long positions that have already been liquidated is 45 times that of short positions, according to the liquidation statistics provided by CoinGlass. Source: Coinglass Potential Turning Point However, there is a glimmer of hope for Solana investors. In the worst-case scenario, if the downtrend persists, Solana’s price could eventually find support in the demand zone, marked by the last candlestick before the remarkable July uptrend began. This area tends to attract buyers and might serve as a potential turning point for SOL’s fortunes. While Solana’s recent rally has generated excitement, caution is advised, as technical indicators and market dynamics point towards a possible continuation of the downtrend. The crypto world remains as unpredictable as ever, and investors should carefully consider their options before diving in. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

One of the factors likely to affect LINK’s price growth in the coming days is the massive movement of tokens from the network’s wallet to exchanges. On September 16, four wallets associated with Chainlink transferred 18.75 million LINK tokens across various platforms, amounting to $119 million. Related Reading: Toncoin Shatters Bearish Predictions With 40% Rally – What’s The Story? These wallets were originally intended for holding tokens that were not yet in circulation. But recently, around 15.7 million LINK tokens (approximately $100 million) left these wallets headed straight to Binance. Furthermore, 3.05 million LINK tokens (roughly $19 million) left the wallets in a multi-signature wallet identified as 0xD50f. Following these significant on-chain activities and potential implications, investors are eager to see how LINK price will react. LINK Breaks Above $6.3 Resistance Level LINK is in an uptrend, forming a bullish engulfing pattern to break above the $6.3 resistance level. Although LINK is still below its 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), today’s green candle has broken above the 50-day SMA, showing increased pressure from buyers. The buyers at the $6.1 support level have forced the crypto coin to rally after the brief retracement between September 16-17. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) displays a value of 58.00, rising from the neutral zone and approaching the overbought region of 70. LINK has overcome the $6.3 resistance level today. Therefore, the buyers will likely sustain the rally in the coming days. Furthermore, the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence displays a strong buy signal confirmed by its green Histogram bars. The cryptocurrency will likely record more price gains in the coming days if the buyers continue to accumulate the tokens. However, the unlock and transfer of 21 million LINK tokens on September 16 could lead to a brief retracement in the long term when the buyers relent. Whales Increase Holdings After Swift Test Since August 31, when Chainlink entered into a partnership with Swift and other companies, LINK has exhibited positive market moves. The interbank communication system Swift and Chainlink, successfully transferred tokenized value across various private and public blockchains in an experiment. The positive development boosted investors’ confidence in buying more LINK tokens, potentially pushing the token’s value up. On September 7, Santiment noticed that Chainlink’s top-tier holders, those with 10,000-100,000 LINK tokens, were actively increasing their holdings. The number of wallets holding 10,000 to 100,000 LINK tokens increased to 3,127, the highest since December 3, 2022. These wallets collected $9.6 million worth of LINK in just three days, 0.154% of the total supply. Additionally, Santiment’s report showed that 98 new wallets in this category were created. Related Reading: Jordan Peterson Sparks Debate On How Bitcoin Can Solve Major Banking Problem On September 9, a crypto expert, Ali, revealed that these whales bought more than 4 million LINK coins, amounting to $24 million in just 10 days. These accumulations show heightened investor interest in Chainlink and will likely drive demand, thereby increasing the token’s price in the coming days.

42392579,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg8Lgv,1695039000,First Mover Americas: Friend.tech Drives Up Coinbase’s Base Blockchain Activity,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Coinbase’s layer 2 blockchain, Base, which launched in early August, has seen its daily transactions hit an all-time high, according to data from IntoTheBlock. Base saw 1.88 million transactions on Thursday, higher than layer 2 rivals Arbitrum and Optimism combined, which saw 780,000 and 370,000, respectively. “Interestingly, it is not decentralized finance (DeFi) applications nor non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces driving the surge in Base's activity. Instead, a significant portion of usage can be attributed to a new social application, FriendTech,” said Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock. Decentralized social network platform Friend.tech is built on Base and calls itself “the marketplace for your friends.” The platform saw increased usage over the last week, with its daily transactions also reaching an all-time high. Friend.tech’s transactions reached 529,000.  The sale of tokens held by bankrupt crypto exchange FTX will not result in a market shock due to several mitigating factors, Coinbase (COIN) said in a research report Thursday. For a start, the sale of tokens won’t flood the market because liquidations are limited to $50 million per week in the first phase and then increase to $100 million in the following weeks, the report said. Coinbase notes that committees representing FTX debtors need to approve a permanent increase to a maximum of $200 million a week. According to a recent court filing, the crypto exchange holds about $1.16 billion in solana (SOL), $560 million in bitcoin (BTC), $192 million in ether (ETH) and a further $1.49 billion in other tokens. It can now sell and invest these holdings to pay back creditors, the court ruled last week.  The U.S. Department of Justice thinks FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s proposed jury questions are “unnecessarily intrusive” and may be intended to support his defense. Bankman-Fried and the DOJ both proposed voir dire questions earlier this week, ranging from standard queries about whether potential jurors were familiar with the case to more specific questions about whether they knew people with ADHD. These questions will help the prosecutor and defense determine a fair and impartial jury. Several of Bankman-Fried’s proposed questions are “intrusive,” prosecutors wrote in the letter to Judge Lewis Kaplan of the Southern District of New York. They called out questions that probed potential jurors’ opinions toward FTX, the allegedly fraudulent crypto exchange that collapsed in spectacular fashion last November.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the recent pop and drop in HIFI, the native token of Polygon-based project Hifi Finance.  The token surged over 450% in the past two weeks only to turn lower after Binance listed HIFI perpetual futures on Sept. 16 at 14:30 UTC.  Tokens often rally into the listing on major exchanges and then sell off on heavy profit-taking, empirical evidence discussed in the book ""Crypto Titans"" suggests.

Ethereum Holesky Testnet Riddled With Misconfigurations The crypto community and Ethereum enthusiasts are presently waiting for the return of Ethereum’s Holesky testnet which was scheduled to launch on Friday, September 15. The Holesky testnet which was created to replace Ethereum’s Goerli testnet after its deprecation in 2024 encountered an unexpected technical hiccup on the day of its release. The release date marked a significant date in the Ethereum community’s history, commemorating the one-year anniversary of Ethereum’s Merge to a Proof of Stake (PoS) network. Related Reading: Jordan Peterson Sparks Debate On How Bitcoin Can Solve Major Banking Problem Ethereum developers have labeled the technical flaw as a “misconfiguration in the ExtraData field.” Reports reveal that the misconfiguration was identified by an Ethereum Researcher named Protolambda. Holesky launch update! Due to a misconfiguration in the ExtraData field (applied to EL configs but not to CL ones), #Holesky didn’t initiate properly. A consensus has been reached among the EF DevOps and client teams to relaunch a week from now. — Nethermind (@NethermindEth) September 15, 2023 One of the DevOps at the Ethereum Foundation, Parithosh revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post the details of Holesky’s launch delay and misconfigurations. Parithosh explained that the flaw was found in one of Holesky’s Genesis files, the el Genesis file. He stated that validators are currently working on the testnet and have succeeded in starting the chain; however, modifications on the network have not been completed so more time will be required to get the testnet back up and running ready for a relaunch. “We had a misconfiguration in the el genesis file and that led to the Holesky network improperly launching.

The testnet was loaded with more than 1 billion Holesky Ether (HETH) to ensure that the network was large and strong enough to handle complex tests on upgrades and developments in the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum’s Holesky testnet has now been rescheduled for release in two weeks. However, no proper date has been announced regarding the relaunch. “It’s extremely likely that we relaunch the network with new genesis files and have the network up two weeks from now,” Ethereum developer, Parithosh stated. Related Reading: Ethereum Merge Is One: Here Are The Highlights So Far While the delay is undoubtedly disappointing to many users, developers have vowed to integrate more validation steps and better docs to make the Holesky testnet stronger and prevent future misconfigurations. The delay in Ethereum’s Holesky testnet has not overly affected the price of its native token, ETH. Presently Ethereum developers are working vigorously to resolve the issue as fast as possible. The Ethereum community also remains hopeful that the delay will result in a more robust and reliable testing environment that will greatly benefit the Ethereum ecosystem.

42392603,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg8Lbn,1695037863,Bitcoin Tops $27K a Week After Death Cross Formation With Fed Likely to Extend Rate Pause,"BTC has gained 8% since the death cross appeared on the daily chart on Sept. 11.  The rally comes as traders see the Fed holding rates steady through the rest of the year.  Bitcoin advanced Monday as U.S. rates traders penciled in greater odds of the Federal Reserve keeping borrowing costs unchanged later this week and through the rest of the year.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value jumped to $27,220, the highest since Aug. 31, having climbed almost 8% since the ominous-sounding death cross pattern appeared on its daily price chart a week ago. The advance since that bearish crossover of the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) below the 200-day moving average reinforces the measure's reputation as an unreliable standalone indicator.  The bounce comes as Fed funds futures indicate a 99% probability the U.S. central bank will leave rates unchanged between 5.25% and 5.5% this Wednesday. The futures also show a 69% chance of no action in November and a 58% probability of the same in December. The central bank has raised rates by 525 basis points since March 2022 to tame inflation, a so-called liquidity tightening that's seen as partly responsible for the past year's crypto crash.  ""No one really expects a change in the policy rate or balance sheet guidance at this meeting,"" Scotiabank said in a preview note to clients on Friday. ""Instead, it will focus upon tweaks to forward guidance on the policy rate, updated macroeconomic projections and guidance that [Fed Chair Jerome] Powell provides. This one is likely to be about buying time.""  The Fed will deliver a policy decision on Wednesday at 14:00 ET accompanied by a statement and full forecast update in the Summary of Economic Projections, including a new ""dot plot"" of interest-rate estimates. Powell will follow with a press conference thirty minutes later.  Scotiabank said the dot plot is likely to keep the door open for one more rate hike before the end of the year, considering the potential for a rebound in inflation and markets' tendency to jump the gun in pricing renewed liquidity easing.  ""The FOMC is likely fully aware of the fact that there have been three prior inflation soft patches during the pandemic that were subsequently followed by a reacceleration of inflationary pressures,"" Scotiabank wrote, referring to the Federal Open Markets Committee.  ""Another reason is to manage markets because the minute the FOMC signals conviction that hikes are definitely done is when traders with their itchy fingers pounce on the front-end and start pricing amplified easing bets. Now is likely too soon for the FOMC to consider such a move,"" the team added.  Analysts at ING do not expect the Fed to carry through with the final forecast hike. It's possible this bounce in bitcoin stems from the belief the Fed's tightening cycle is over. The cryptocurrency is widely considered a pure play on liquidity and is more sensitive to changes in interest-rate expectations than equities are.  According to ING, ""the greater risk might be the Fed scaling down its dot plot median forecast of a 100 basis points easing cycle in 2024.""  A hawkish scenario might put a bid under the greenback and stall the bitcoin's bounce.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/18/bitcoin-tops-27k-a-week-after-death-cross-formation-with-fed-likely-to-extend-rate-pause,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/40a9ef1a2627a73b072edd4e5e4843b3fbeecefc-1724x1069.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

17793039,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551723,1695034806,Was The SEC In Bed With Ethereum? ETH Gate Explained,"Conspiracy theory or one of the biggest scandals in crypto? The term “ETH Gate” has been on the lips of every XRP supporter in recent months and, increasingly, the broader cryptocurrency community. At the heart of this issue is the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision to classify Ethereum (ETH) as a non-security, contrasting sharply with its ongoing legal action against Ripple and the XRP token. What is ETH Gate “ETH Gate” refers to a theory alleging that the Ethereum Foundation and ConsenSys have fostered close relationships with key individuals within the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other entities like JP Morgan, thereby ensuring a favorable regulatory environment for Ethereum. One cornerstone of this theory are the Hinman emails which were released earlier this year. In these emails, Hinman, who made the landmark speech in 2018 declaring that Ethereum was not a security, interacted with Ethereum’s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin right before the speech. Hinman reportedly consulted Buterin to “understand the operational dynamics of Ethereum.” Related Reading: Ethereum Merge Is One: Here Are The Highlights So Far Remarkably, Bill Hinman rejoined the law firm Simpson Thacher in 2020 after leaving the SEC. The significance? Simpson Thacher is associated with the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance. Therefore, the XRP army believes that Hinman’s decision to deliver a speech giving Ethereum a regulatory “free pass” may not have been impartial. Speculations By XRP Army John E Deaton, an outspoken figure in the XRP community and a keen observer of the SEC’s dealings, has painstakingly put forth allegations suggesting a deeper web of interlinked relationships that hint at possible conflicts of interest. (There are so many that it is not even possible to highlight them all in one article.) His assertions have become pivotal in the “ETH Gate” theory, and here we’ll delve deeper into these connections. 1. Joseph Lubin’s Strategic Moves: Joseph Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and founder of ConsenSys, is at the core of Deaton’s claims. According to Deaton, within just two months of Jay Clayton’s appointment as the SEC Chairman, Lubin made a potentially strategic hire, bringing on board Patrick Berarducci from the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell. This move is seen by Deaton and many in the XRP community as more than coincidental. Deaton has drawn attention to this connection in the past, positing that it might have provided Ethereum an inside track or at least a more favorable disposition from the SEC. Sullivan & Cromwell is also notable because Jay Clayton himself was a partner there before his stint as the SEC Chairman. 2. The Hinman-Lubin Email Exchange: Deaton frequently refers to the now-infamous email exchange between Bill Hinman and Joseph Lubin. For Deaton, this correspondence underscores a problematic level of proximity between a regulatory figure and a significant player in the crypto sphere. The fact that Hinman reportedly emailed Lubin directly is seen by Deaton as a potential sign of collaboration or at least a peculiar level of familiarity. More so, given Hinman’s subsequent public remarks about Ethereum being a non-security, despite warnings against such pronouncements from the SEC’s Office of General Counsel. 3. Jay Clayton and One River Digital Asset Management: After his tenure at the SEC, Jay Clayton joined One River Digital Asset Management. Deaton emphasizes this move as a point of contention. One River is known for its large holdings of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Deaton hints at a potential conflict of interest, questioning if Clayton’s decisions during his time at the SEC may have been influenced by future career prospects or associations that favored Ethereum. 4. Simpson Thacher, Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, and Hinman: One of the most significant points of contention brought forth by Deaton involves Bill Hinman’s associations with the law firm Simpson Thacher. This firm played a role in the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance. Deaton suggests that Hinman’s connection to Simpson Thacher and, by extension, the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, could have influenced his decision to publicly declare Ethereum a non-security. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominates Ethereum In Daily Active Addresses Despite Lagging In TX Count Similarly, an XRP community member known as Mr. Huber has been extremely vocal and is raising compelling questions: “ETH Gate is a conspiracy theory that the SEC tried to create a monopoly for Ethereum?” He goes on to argue that this is a concerted attempt by powerful Wall Street banks like JPMorgan to “control the global crypto market by bribing the SEC to gain a monopoly for Ethereum.” Latest News On ETH Gate Yesterday, John E Deaton indicated that new, potentially damning, information about ETH Gate might soon be disclosed. “I’ve always said that one day we will get the full truth. Today is one day closer,” Deaton tweeted in response to Steven Nerayoff’s lawyer, Michael Scotto, who indicated that Nerayoff is prepared to make his facts known “at a time and manner that serves the interests of justice and the people.” Steven Nerayoff, an early adviser to Ethereum, had extortion charges against him dismissed in May this year. Deaton speculates that Nerayoff could be a significant source of insider information, possibly related to Ethereum’s regulatory free pass. “I have the map,” was Nerayoff unequivocal response to Deaton’s speculative tweets about the matter, as Bitcoinist reported today. The “ETH Gate” controversy calls into question the impartiality of the SEC in its treatment of different cryptocurrencies. Although allegations remain unproven, the gathered evidence paints a picture of inconsistent regulatory approaches and potential conflicts of interest. Whether these allegations hold any water remains to be seen, but they have certainly fueled a sense of urgency and scrutiny around the SEC’s policies. If the hints dropped by Steven Nerayoff and John E Deaton materialize into something substantive, ETH Gate could become a pivotal chapter in the annals of cryptocurrency regulation. At press time, ETH traded at $1,635.

42392560,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg8KRz,1695032386,Tether Co-Founder Sizes Up PayPal’s Stablecoin Ambitions,"Tether co-founder Quigley says PayPal’s stablecoin ambitions are driven largely by potential savings on trillions of dollars worth of multicurrency transactions.  When he helped found Tether, Quigley, who also invested in PayPal, thought of it as “a charitable contribution to the open-source blockchain community.”  William Quigley, one of the co-founders of Tether, said that while he believes privately issued stablecoins are “a benefit to society in every respect,” the recent arrival of PayPal’s PYUSD token is unlikely to bring much innovation.  “I don’t think much innovation will come from PayPal,” Quigley said in an interview with CoinDesk. “I think PayPal will see this principally as a cost saving. They may or may not pass on a portion of that to their end users.”  The stablecoin market is dominated by Tether (USDT), far and away the largest and most liquid of the dollar-pegged tokens, followed by Circle’s USD Coin (USDC). Still, nobody would doubt PayPal’s ability to shake up the stablecoin leaderboard, given its reach into hundreds of millions of wallets around the globe.  Quigley, who left Tether in 2015, was also an early investor in Paypal though he no longer holds any of its stock. He said he knew PayPal had been looking at stablecoins for seven or eight years, driven largely by the potential savings on the many multicurrency transactions carried out by hundreds of millions of PayPal users.  The payments world is blanketed by financial intermediaries, each extracting a toll for their services. Creating a stablecoin involves PayPal buying a basket of currencies and holding these yen, euros, rupees, won and so on in banks across the world. Once PayPal tokenizes the currency backed by those bank deposits, it has a private, multicurrency money supply that exists outside the global banking system and is free of any third-party toll collectors, Quigley explained.  This means when an American consumer with dollars purchases a product from a German merchant needing euros, PayPal doesn’t have to use a financial institution to settle the transaction because it already owns both currencies.  “All transactions are now done on its private blockchain outside of the Visa network and the banking system,” Quigley said. “There are no financial intermediaries anymore – just PayPal. There is no third-party FX intermediary taking margin because real currency is not being swapped. It’s just one token being exchanged for another. There’s no FX or interchange fee.”  Quigley said PayPal, which charges consumers and merchants 200 basis points and higher to exchange currencies on cross-border transactions, can exploit its new stablecoin network in one of two ways.  “PayPal can continue to assess consumers' and merchants' currency conversion fees on each transaction even though it no longer incurs those fees, and retain 100% of those fees as profit. Or, it can eliminate the currency conversion charges it has heretofore assessed its customers and lower their overall cross-border transaction costs,” he said.  Large stablecoin operators today, who hold dozens of billions of dollars in things like U.S. Treasury bills, earn impressive yields on those reserves thanks to interest-rate increases in recent years – a potential earner Quigley admits he didn’t see coming.  “When we did Tether, I thought of it as a charitable contribution to the open-source blockchain community,” he said. “I remember someone said, ‘What if we got like $500 million in deposits?’ Keep in mind, interest rates were basically zero at that time, and of course, I never thought it would get to $50 billion.”  Tether’s market cap is now about $80 billion, CoinMarketCap data show.",NEUTRAL,USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | USDT,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/09/18/tether-co-founder-sizes-up-paypals-stablecoin-ambitions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e9f30a332fd003aeb456a114e3b91bf8892e5f72-795x447.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A sudden dip in DOGE’s price sent shockwaves through the market, breaking a pivotal support trendline that had historically bolstered the coin’s recovery phases. This breach raised concerns of a continued decline, but recent developments suggest that the meme-inspired cryptocurrency may be gearing up for a fresh rally. One glimmer of hope for DOGE came in the form of newfound support at the $0.06 price level. This development, combined with the broader market’s bullish sentiment, contributed to a modest recovery earlier today. Related Reading: Dogecoin Key Challenge: Will The $0.06 Support Level Hold? However, it’s important to note that the price has since experienced some corrections, highlighting the ongoing volatility in the cryptocurrency space. At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.061802 on CoinGecko, reflecting a 1.0% decline in the past 24 hours and a 0.6% loss over the past week. DOGE’s Bearish Threat Looms Despite the recent positive movement, DOGE remains vulnerable to potential bearish pressures. If bears manage to establish dominance around the overhead trendline, particularly at the $0.064 price level, the meme coin may face renewed selling pressure. In such a scenario, a decline of 10-12% could be on the horizon, potentially pushing DOGE prices toward the $0.057 region. DOGE market cap currently at $8.7 billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com Meanwhile, in a surprising turn of events over the weekend, Billy Markus, the creator of Dogecoin, took to Twitter to express his thoughts on the state of the Dogecoin community. Responding to a user’s lament about the decline in community engagement, Markus did not hold back. He declared the Dogecoin community as “dead” for over a year, placing blame on its most active members for creating unnecessary drama rather than fostering a positive environment. I’ve observed a decline in the Dogecoin community recently. It appears that many are prioritizing ad revenue over engaging with our own community. It’s disheartening to see making $10-15 become more important than nurturing the community. 😢 — Tyler Milgate (@MilgateTyler) September 14, 2023 DOGE Continues To Shine While Markus’s words may seem harsh, they carry an air of irony. Dogecoin, with its iconic Shiba Inu mascot, remains a beloved figure in the meme-cryptocurrency landscape, transcending traditional expectations for digital assets. This ironic twist adds an element of intrigue to the ongoing Dogecoin narrative, as enthusiasts and traders eagerly await the next chapter in this rollercoaster journey. Related Reading: Algorand (ALGO) May Have A Chance At A Bullish Streak – Here’s How Dogecoin’s recent price fluctuations, combined with the candid remarks of its creator, have ignited speculation about the cryptocurrency’s future trajectory.

42392567,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg8Krd,1695029242,"Bitcoin Punches Above $27K, but Analysts Have Bearish Price Predictions","Bitcoin (BTC) zoomed above the $27,000 price level in European afternoon hours on Monday, with ether (ETH) holding above support levels, though interest-rate decisions due later this week may introduce downward pressure.  Markets remained generally tepid over the weekend, with overall capitalization growing just 0.4% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data. Crypto futures liquidations clocked in at just $48 million – their lowest level since mid-August – while open interest, or the amount of futures contracts, grew 4%, suggesting a low sentiment.  As of Asian afternoon hours, the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) rose 0.3%, mirroring low gains among alternative currencies.  Toncoin (TON) led losses among major tokens, dropping 1% in the past 24 hours, most likely as traders took profits on a 40% increase last week after messaging giant Telegram said it would integrate a TON-based app on its platform.  Meanwhile, some traders are awaiting key decisions in traditional markets they say could be bearish for the crypto environment.  “Markets could move nervously in the next few days as we await major data prints from the U.K. and U.S., with both countries’ central banks due to announce new rate decisions later this week,” said Simon Peters, a market analyst at investing platform eToro, in a note to CoinDesk.  “Despite inflation falling in both economies, signs are there that this retreat might not be fully felt yet. Like other risk assets, crypto assets are sensitive to rate expectations so any hardening in tone could leave investor sentiment bearish,” he wrote.  Elsewhere, analysts at the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant pointed out recent price moves have not impacted the estimated leverage ratio on bitcoin and ether.  The ratio is a measure of an exchange's open interest divided by their coins reserve which shows how much leverage is used by users on average.

For a start, the sale of tokens won’t flood the market because liquidations are limited to $50 million per week in the first phase and then increase to $100 million in the following weeks, the report said. Coinbase notes that committees representing FTX debtors need to approve a permanent increase to a maximum of $200 million a week.  According to a recent court filing, the crypto exchange holds about $1.16 billion in solana (SOL), $560 million in bitcoin (BTC), $192 million in ether (ETH) and a further $1.49 billion in other tokens. It can now sell and invest these holdings to pay back creditors, the court ruled last week.  Additionally, there are “strict controls in place for selling certain ‘insider-affiliated’ tokens that require 10 days advance notice to these same committees,” wrote David Duong, head of institutional research.  A large part of FTX's solana holdings are locked up until 2025 as part of the token’s vesting schedule, as are some other tokens that need to be sold, the note said.  Lastly, FTX will be able to hedge its sales of bitcoin, ether and other tokens through an investment adviser once it has received committee approval, the report added.

42392574,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg8L71,1695023912,New Avalanche Dapp Lets Traders Swap Hundreds of Different Tokens in Single Transaction,"A developer team building on the Avalanche blockchain has introduced a trading tool that lets users swap up to 300 different tokens in the same transaction.  Multiswap, by the team at CavalRe, has recorded the highest number of token swaps in a testing period at 340 different tokens, developers said during a panel in Seoul last week.  Decentralized exchange (DEX) liquidity pools usually let traders swap one token type for another. Multiswap’s code creates a liquidity pool containing many different tokens that can be easily traded with each other, enabling multiple trades to occur in a single transaction.  A liquidity pool is a pile of cryptocurrency locked in a smart contract. This results in creating liquidity for faster transactions. Users supplying tokens to the pools are referred to as liquidity providers (LPs).  The new tool allows users to set up more complex trading strategies, such as those that involve various tokens and must be conducted quickly at low fees.  “Think of it like a new kind of decentralized ETF,” said CavalRe founder Eric Forgy in a message to CoinDesk. “On testnet, we have a pool with over 500 tokens representing a mockup of the S&P 500 for demo purposes, which represents over 125K trading pairs with zero fragmentation of liquidity.”  “The entire liquidity for each token is available for trading against any other token in the pool. You would need 125K separate pools to replicate this on Uniswap, which just splinters any available liquidity,” Forgy said.  Nevertheless, security risks due to the inherent nature of sophisticated blockchain-based applications remain and users must be wary, Forgy said.  “No piece of software whether on blockchain or not could ever claim to be free of security risks. For example, there was a recent exploit due to certain contracts being written in an older version of Vyper, a Python derivative, due to a bug in the compiler. These things are very difficult to defend against,” Forgy told CoinDesk.  “We feel confident about Solidity and the security of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) used by Avalanche's C-chain where we have deployed initially,” he said. Solidity is the programming language used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.  In the coming months, Multiswap will explore expansion possibilities in the form of tokenized foreign currencies, commodities and equities.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/09/18/new-avalanche-dapp-lets-traders-swap-hundreds-of-different-tokens-in-single-transaction,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/75b0fa4496e566ec8e4e93612e6b13ac062e0a82-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In support of this, Best-selling Author and Clinical Psychologist Jordan Peterson has suggested that customers should abandon the banking system and probably adopt Bitcoin. Jordan Peterson Says Bitcoin Over Banks Peterson was making this suggestion in response to a news report that Macquarie Bank, Australia’s fifth largest bank, was planning to transition to a digital-only banking system by November 2024. In line with this, the bank will begin phasing out cash, cheque, and phone payment services as part of its offerings. Related Reading: Ethereum Merge Is One: Here Are The Highlights So Far The psychologist quoted the report and stated, “Maybe it’s time to scrap Banks,” and further quizzed, “Could Bitcoin fix this?” Maybe it’s time to scrap Banks Could Bitcoin fix this? https://t.co/j6wldXMv7P — Dr Jordan B Peterson (@jordanbpeterson) September 14, 2023 For one, Macquarie Bank’s decision has been widely criticized as it potentially excludes certain customer groups. Furthermore, this move also highlights one of the problems that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin aim to solve by giving customers more control over their money. It is believed that these financial institutions shouldn’t be able to have so much control over people’s finances and decide how they spend their money as these banks could easily implement policies that do not favor or cause difficulties to certain customer groups. Additionally, Macquarie, in a statement, described digital transactions as being a “safer, quicker, and more convenient way to bank.” However, crypto advocates beg to differ as, in response to Peterson’s tweet, some responded that networks like the Bitcoin Lightning Network, XRP Ledger, and Bitcoin Cash are a better alternative than the banks’ digital systems. Lightning Network To The Rescue Many, including Republican presidential candidate Aaron Day, seem to be against the idea of Bitcoin replacing banks. In response to Peterson’s tweet, Day stated that the traditional banking system could do between 50,000 and 100,000 transactions per second (TPS), unlike Bitcoin, which has a TPS of seven. He also elaborated that the CBDC pilot in the US can do 1.7 million TPS. No, it couldn’t. The traditional banking system can do 50k-100k transactions per second. The CBDC pilot in the US can do 1.7 million TPS. BTC can do 7 TPS. You need to do some research before you spout BTC. You might think you are in the in crowd but you’ve actually taken a… — Aaron Day 2024: Truth and Transformation (@AaronRDay) September 14, 2023 Following this, crypto supporters quickly responded that the Bitcoin Lightning Network helps to solve this problem as it boasts a TPS of up to 1 million, making it faster than the traditional banking system, which Day argues for.

42392577,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg8LWf,1695020002,"Ether Trading at 27% Discount to Fair Value, New Research Shows","Ether is trading at a 27% discount to its fair value, according to research firm RxR's blended Metcalfe law-centric valuation model, which incorporates active user adoption of layer 2 scaling networks.  Traditional models that focus exclusively on the active user adoption of the Ethereum layer 1 might be misleading.  Ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, is trading at a 27% discount to its fair value, according to analysis by RxR, a research-focused joint venture between Republic Crypto and Re7 Capital.  RxR's fair value projection is based on a blended version of the Metcalfe law, which includes the active user base on the ever-growing Ethereum scaling networks and active users on the Ethereum mainnet to gauge the network's fair value. Traditional Metcalfe law models tend to focus only on the active user base on the mainnet.  Per the Metcalfe law (ML), the value of the network is directly linked and proportional to the square of the number of users it has. Ether enables users to transact on the Ethereum blockchain, earn interest, and participate in network security through staking, store non-fungible tokens and much more. Thus, ether's value proposition has long been closely tied to Ethereum's network usage.  ""Ethereum’s network valuation tracks the updated ML index better when the active user base of Ethereum’s scaling networks is factored into the model than when omitted,"" Lewis Harland, analyst at RxR, said in the research note published last week.  ""The updated model, which does factor in these networks, puts ETH’s valuation at $275 billion (current MCAP trading at a 27% discount), assuming no further user growth in perpetuity,"" Harland added.  Ether's market cap looks undervalued compared to the RxR's ML Blended Model, represented by the red.  It's more reliable than the while line, representing the traditional ML model, which ignores the increasing activity on the layer 2 networks or offchain solutions built on the top of the mainnet to reduce bottlenecks with scaling and data. In other words, ether is not necessarily overvalued, as the traditional ML Model suggests.  Layer 2 has become one of the most exciting areas in the market, with key protocols finding their niche. Per IntoTheBlock, Coinbase's BASE has the most unique addresses and transactions, while Arbitrum dominates transaction volume and Optimism is focused on its superchain vision.  In two years, the total value locked in the layer 2 protocols has increased more than tripled to over $9 billion, according to data source L2Beat.  ""A key change in April 2021 was when scaling networks started contributing to Ethereum’s blockspace at scale. For example, Curve, Sushiswap, Decentraland, and Aave launched on Polygon (PoS) between April and May 2021 - these collectively drove the total value-bridged to Polygon to $10 billion."" Harland said.  ""Fast forward to today and over 250 applications on Ethereum have a total value-locked of >$1m. Nearly 30 layer 2 networks have an aggregate TVL of $10 billion due to the advent of rollup-centric solutions."" Harland added, stressing the importance of incorporating the layer 2 activity in the ML fair value models.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/18/ether-trading-at-27-discount-to-fair-value-new-research-shows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/45495d3891ecc894a9984f4b66038644407ea5dd-1814x1074.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Such attacks are extremely common in the crypto industry, as users may fail to check the source of requests on a crypto wallet, or unknowingly download a fake application that mimics the original – one that exists only to steal holdings.  Cuban’s wallet was drained of U.S.-pegged stablecoins, staked ETH (stETH), SuperRare (RARE) tokens, and some Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domains, blockchain data shows. These movements were first spotted by on-chain sleuth @wazzcrypto.  Later, Cuban was likely alerted of these transactions and managed to save over $2.5 million worth of Polygon’s MATIC tokens by logging into the wallet and transferring the tokens to a Coinbase exchange address.  The phishing attack apparently seemed to stem from a fake MetaMask wallet application downloaded by Cuban, he told DLNews.  This was the second phishing attack to hit a high-profile person in as many weeks. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s X account was compromised in a phishing attack in early September.

Hong Kong-based JPEX has been operating in the territory without a license, the Securities and Futures Commission, Hong Kong's market regulator says, and police have received over 1,408 complaints about the platform. Local media reports that the amount involved in the complaints totals $128 million.  “Recently, due to the unfair treatment by relevant institutions in Hong Kong towards JPEX, a cryptocurrency trading platform, and a series of negative news, our partnered third-party market makers have maliciously frozen funds,” the exchange said in a blog post early Monday Hong Kong time. “They demanded more information from the platform for negotiation, restricting our liquidity and significantly increasing our daily operating costs, leading to operational difficulties.”  Amid these liquidity challenges, JPEX said it will delist all transactions on its Earn Trading interface as of Monday while ensuring ongoing orders and adjusting withdrawal fees. The exchange also said it is considering restructuring as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).  The exchange also promised to continue operating and criticized the SFC for its actions.  ""As an operator in the cryptocurrency industry and a promoter of the Web 3.0 concept, JPEX expresses extreme disappointment at the SFC’s unfair practices that disrupt market order,"" the exchange said in a post. ""Not only does their attitude contradict the government’s policy development direction of making Hong Kong a Web 3.0 city, but their biased stance also does not fulfill their role as a fair and impartial regulator, let alone protect the multitude of investors in Hong Kong.""  JPEX has been on the SFC's investor alert list since July 2022.  Local media in Taiwan report that JPEX’s Taipei office was recently vacated, and authorities have reportedly questioned Taiwanese influencers hired by the exchange.  On its website, JPEX says it is licensed by securities authorities in Australia and has registration with the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a Money Services Business (MSB).  Attendees who visited JPEX’s booth during the recent Token2049 conference in Singapore reportedly found it abandoned after the first day.  JPEX's thinly traded exchange token, JPC, is down 21% during the last 24 hours.
