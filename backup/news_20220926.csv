42422266,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0jRRh,1664225002,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Pushes Higher as Traditional Markets Decline,"Price Action  Bitcoin and ether start the week trading higher following a downturn over the weekend. Both currencies sank below key psychological levels before reversing course on Monday.  Bitcoin’s (BTC) price rose 1.9% on strong volume, regaining a portion of the 2.52% it lost over the weekend. The uptick in volume on Monday’s push higher is an additional positive sign. Still, BTC continues to trade in a relatively tight range, alternating between up and down days. Currently BTC is trading above the psychologically important $19,000 mark.  Ether (ETH) rose 2.6% and is maintaining a strong 30-day correlation coefficient (0.78) to BTC’s price. Correlations range between 1.0 and -1.0, with the former implying a direct relationship, and the latter implying a completely inverse relationship. Given their strong relationship, it’s unsurprising that ETH moved in tandem with BTC both in direction and in volume over the weekend. ETH reclaimed the psychologically important $1,300 mark. The supply for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has now increased by 8,400 ETH since transitioning to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Absent the switch, estimates indicate that ETH supply would have grown by over 140,000 ETH over the same time frame  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures performance across a basket of cryptocurrencies, rose 1.6% on the day.  Economic Calendar: the calendar was relatively quiet for Monday, ahead of traditionally more impactful data for durable goods and home sales to be released on Tuesday.  In fixed income markets, two-year Treasury yields increased to 4.3%, reaching levels last seen in August of 2007. The yield curve between the two-year and 10-year Treasurys remain inverted, as rates for the former are higher than the latter.  An inverted yield curve implies that investors are placing a higher degree of risk on short-term lending than they are longer-term lending.  Historically, inverted yield curves have been precursors to economic recessions that negatively affect all risk assets, cryptocurrencies included.  U.S. equities: Traditional equities dropped, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), tech-heavy Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 declined 1.1%, 0.6%, and 1%, respectively.  Commodities: WTI crude oil fell 2.4% and now trades below $80 per barrel. European Brent crude fell 2.3%, declining below $85, while natural gas was 3% higher. Copper, often used as a barometer for economic health, fell 1.3%, while safe-haven asset gold declined 1.3%.  Latest Prices  ● Bitcoin (BTC): $19,164 +1.3%        ● Ether (ETH): $1,327 +2.6%        ● CoinDesk Market Index (CMI): $956 +1.1%        ● S&P 500 daily close: 3,655.04 −1.0%        ● Gold: $1,630 per troy ounce −0.9%        ● Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.88% +0.2        Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  BTC Trades Higher as Traditional Markets Decline  Despite turmoil in traditional financial markets, bitcoin is holding up relatively well on Monday. Its resilience is interesting given its tendency to trade in concert with the Nasdaq Composite, which is down 0.8% Monday.  Traditional financial markets are trading lower Monday largely because of global recession fears. The British pound has declined to record lows following news that the Bank of England may raise its interest rates aggressively.  The Bank of England would join a growing list of central banks that have adopted hawkish monetary policies, including steep interest rate hikes.  BTC still appears decidedly neutral and is essentially trading where it was in mid to late June. The short-term price peak realized in mid August ($24,000) has been followed by a persistent decline to current levels.  The current price level of $19,000 sits approximately 20% below the August peak, representing an opportunity set of sorts to bullish traders.  Derivatives markets, however, are not signaling much optimism at the moment. As mentioned in Friday’s Market Wrap, options open interest by strike price showed some appetite for risk, but even that appears to have waned as call open interest at the $20,000 strike price has decreased.  A call option represents the right but not the obligation to purchase an asset at a particular (strike) price. Open interest refers to the number of active contracts that would allow investors to do so.  The option open interest put/call ratio has also moved higher, implying an increase in bearish sentiment for BTC in the short term.  Technically, there doesn’t appear to be cause for alarm, but not much in the way of celebration either. BTC’s relative strength index (RSI) indicator is 42 which is a neutral reading.  RSI is a technical indicator that measures an asset’s momentum. Readings above 70 imply that an asset is trading above fair value, while readings 30 and below imply the opposite. As it stands, the market sees BTC as fairly valued.

""Badinage,"" my English teacher would say sternly. ""Mindless chatter."" The thing was, I was a solid student eager to do well but I just didn't enjoy classroom learning. Sitting still while being lectured was so painful at times. I even tried unsuccessfully to talk my parents into letting me skip college.  In the middle of my senior year at Dartmouth I realized I had finally had it with school. I went to the dean and asked to withdraw. He referred me to the school psychologist because, he said, he was concerned that I didn't love school. We quickly came to an agreement and I finished one term early and still got my diploma.  This article is part of Education Week. Read CoinDesk's third annual Best Universities for Blockchain Ranking.  The thing is, I have found my own way to become a lifelong student without ever stepping in a classroom again: I became a journalist, and my workplace is like a school without lectures.  Blockchain, and especially its application as cryptocurrency, is a fascinating example of something I can relate to: ordinary people practicing autodidactism. Most people who mine or buy or makes a purchase with crypto had to learn about crypto on their own. What was that first pizza purchase, anyway, but a test of a theory found in a white paper?  As blockchain and crypto have grown over more than a decade, the ecosystem has become increasingly complex. Think about the policy issues that must be addressed legally. What about the environmental issues, creative applications and the promise of reshaping a more equitable society?  Plus the number of people eager to learn about crypto has grown exponentially. According to Bankrate.com, by last year 60 million Americans alone owned crypto.  All these people and the ones to come will not all teach themselves. As teens go to college, they are forming crypto clubs and showing interest in being taught blockchain. But university curriculums are slow to change, and blockchain is transforming every day. That’s why we’re seeing blockchain research centers and industry/university collaborations on projects. Universities are doing what they can to keep up.  There’s a sense of futility for some critics, who think universities are the wrong institution for teaching blockchain given the industry's anti-establishment bent. But for others, universities make sense, with adjustments.  Crypto is a place for students like me who had trouble with the formalities of school, but also for those who thrive. Open source technology welcomes all kinds.

42411348,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNHwB,1664220654,Why Rankings – Including University Rankings – Are Crap,"While rankings (especially university rankings) have non-zero value, they have significantly less value than we, as a society, seem to ascribe to them. What we’ve compiled here is a collection of data (based on arbitrary criteria) that has been assigned a weight (based on arbitrary values). At best this is subjective, and at worst it’s fundamentally flawed. Ultimately, I feel strongly that any rankings generated by humans are much closer to the “fundamentally flawed” end of the spectrum. There are reasons for this that exist on both the universal scale and a more granular scale that is specific to our project.  This post is part of Education Week.  Starting with the macro, most rankings are limited simply because they force an order on things that, inherently, have no order. Blanket statements are rarely correct in all circumstances; we live in a world of edge cases. The common example leveraged in discussions about why university rankings in general should be abolished (a position that may have merit) is that the No. 1 school (say, Oxford, in the 2022 Times Higher Education rankings) ought not be everyone’s number one choice. Individual circumstances, future goals, personality types, etc. all create a complex landscape in which Oxford is not a universally good (or even mediocre) choice. What being ranked No. 1 is really signaling is that someone out there thinks that Oxford possibly (but not certainly) has more of the things they personally value than most other schools. This is an interesting data point that many people internalize as absolute truth.  For a more visceral example, it would be pretty easy for someone to create a ranking of food (or, alternatively, “insert your preferred highly subjective thing here”). If I were the one to create it, my own biases and thoughts would guide these rankings to a degree that I hope people would find unacceptable. I’d gather objective data on things such as likelihood of an allergic reaction, cost, ease of commercial availability, environmental impact and so on. I could quantify these data points into a cute little spreadsheet, run similar normalization and generate an “objective” ranking of the best food. Nobody, with few exceptions, should change their eating preferences based on this list. The underlying data might be useful (perhaps if all you care about is environmental impact, you could change your eating based on that narrow dataset), but it's highly unlikely that your specific values along every dimension of the data will be reflected in the methodology. People intuitively recognize the futility of ranking something as subjective as food. What we fail to recognize is that school rankings are no different.  The same subjective preferences that underpin thoughts about ranking foods ought to be applied to universities: Just as some humans value taste or health or allergies to varying degrees in a food context, different people value different things in a university experience. In fact, I’d go so far as to say, with a high degree of confidence, that the best, most useful rankings aren’t actually rankings at all. Instead, it would be little more than an interface into the data, allowing each person to adjust the methodology to suit their own individual needs. Unfortunately, not only does this not produce any kind of order, it’s also not particularly flashy or newsworthy.  On a micro scale, our rankings are also flawed in their own unique way. We suffer from all of the issues set out above (with the notable exception that here we know exactly whose biases are slipping into the methodology and who to blame, and that person is me, as the originator of and consultant for the CoinDesk Best Universities for Blockchain rankings since 2020), plus some new ones that are unfortunate artifacts of our limited size and scope. While it’s always a bit humbling (bordering on humiliating) to reflect on the ways in which one’s own study/analysis fell short, it’s more important that any reader keep these in mind when reading through the rankings. If nothing else, I hope this drives home some skepticism about rankings as anything more than a rough-hewn guide to what schools are doing something close to what I, personally, think they should be doing to promote blockchain education.  CoinDesk's Education Week: The Best Universities for Blockchain 2022  While not diminishing the other shortcomings of our research, there are two metrics that are causing particular concern due to data collection challenges, and I highlight these to point out the kinds of challenges that pervade research of this nature. The first is employment data. In my mind, this represents the largest delta between the relative importance of the data (here, favorable student outcomes) and the ease of gathering said data (for many reasons, not least of all the lack of tracking student outcomes with the required granularity). At the moment, we rely on a combination of school outreach, which receives about zero response rate, and manual data collection. The best way (and main way) we’ve found to get a reasonable proxy for this data is to look at large international companies on LinkedIn and see where their employees have gone to school. Whether you’re concerned about the Western bias of LinkedIn, the subjective nature of choosing companies to scrape, the skewed sample found on LinkedIn or something else entirely … you’re absolutely right. We’ve increasingly lowered the importance of this metric year after year to help combat an overrepresentation of skewed data, and have found increasingly useful proxies for this data so we’re less reliant on LinkedIn. Still, this should give a rational reader pause.  The second metric of concern is our entire qualitative section (another metric that has been rendered less and less important in our methodology every year). To some extent, this one is the most upsetting to me because we reasonably could gather strong data. The problem is a lack of creative problem solving on my part. We put out a very public survey every year to try and gather a robust view of how the public (students, academics, industry stakeholders, etc.) sees different universities and get a sense of which universities are perceived as having the most impact. All of the expected worries are highly valid (CoinDesk is skewed towards the U.S., etc.), but the biggest issue, by far, is that I can’t figure out how to properly incentivize accurate responses.  Every year, we make the same request of survey participants: Please tell us which schools you think are doing the best work in the blockchain space. And every year, the results indicate that everyone is simply sharing the schools that, if they were to be ranked highly, would most benefit the individual responder. Of course, I’m editorializing quite a bit, but the overwhelming majority of responses that we get follow the highly predictable pattern of single-school answers, clumped together by school, within 0-5 hours after a school tweets about our survey. There’s some amount of logic to the idea that students/faculty/alums think their school is doing great work (perhaps that’s why they chose that institution), but the shocking number of responses we get following this pattern, occasionally even suggesting that a school that has no discernable blockchain activity is the single best school in the space, implies to me that perhaps we are not incentivizing the right thing. In the future, I hope to experiment with other mechanics (Keynesian beauty contests, etc.), but for now, I consider this data to be highly skewed. What we’ve incentivized to date seems to be a popularity contest, not objective analysis.  That said, these problems plague rankings of all kinds. I don’t share these facts to diminish the value of our rankings, because I still believe that, properly contextualized, some combination of the rankings and the underlying data have at least some value. If not properly contextualized, however, they are crap. Ultimately, perhaps the most helpful thing we can do is remain committed to being open and transparent with our methodology, our data, our processes and, most importantly, our failures. Our rankings are not perfect; all we can do is improve upon them year after year and caution people to apply a reasonable amount of context when evaluating the list. Please reach out if you’d like to talk about these rankings, how they can be improved, or why they should be abolished.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | RESEARCH,Reuben Youngblom,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/09/26/why-rankings-including-university-rankings-are-crap,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/47bc543287059b46bc5fab797ce9418e29ccd731-1500x866.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393956,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brdENl,1664220529,Autodidacts Welcome!,"If you hang around long enough in the crypto space you’ll soon hear the word “autodidact.” As defined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary it means simply “a self-taught person.” The space is chock-full of autodidacts.  “Ninety-five percent of the people in the space are self-taught,” said Isaiah Jackson, an autodidact and author of “Bitcoin & Black America.” “They do their own research and they find their own sources.”  This article is part of Education Week. Read CoinDesk's ranking for the best universities for blockchain in 2022.  Just a few examples: Craig Wright is an autodidact, once described by Wired as “an almost obsessive autodidact and self-claimed double-Ph.D.” Nick Szabo is an autodidact, once telling Tim Ferriss that “my smartest teachers, mentors, peers these days are all on Twitter and blogs and they’re mostly autodidacts.” Vitalik Buterin is an autodidact who learned about bitcoin when he was still in high school, explaining that “I was definitely curious and read a bunch of books.”  Buterin was such a promising self-learner that in 2014 he received a grant from Peter Thiel, another crypto-friendly autodidact (among other things), who awards annual $100,000 grants that are, essentially, juicy prizes for autodidacts. Thiel neatly summed up the ethos of autodidactism, saying at the time: “We hope the 2014 Thiel Fellows inspire people of all ages as they demonstrate that intellectual curiosity, grit and determination are more important than credentials for improving civilization.""  See also: The Educator-Entrepreneurs of Crypto  Why is there such a strong overlap between crypto and autodidacts? “It’s a natural filter,” said Erik Voorhees, a longtime bitcoin bull and the founder of ShapeShift. “Crypto couldn’t be learned in institutions until recently,” he said over email, so anyone who chose this path by definition did so with their own grit and hustle. Or as he put it more elegantly, they’re “self-motivated enough to enter an unexplored pasture with no shepherd.”  A classic autodidact story: Isaiah Jackson was a high school teacher in 2013. He heard about Bitcoin from a roommate, then he immediately read the white paper. He then read it “100 more times.” He lurked on websites like Reddit and Bitcoin Talk Forum. “There wasn’t a lot of information in 2013,” said Jackson. “You really had to search for info.”  Magdalena Gronowska learned the same way. “Most people got into this space through being self-taught,” said Gronowska, aka @Crypto_Mags. “Whether that’s through podcasts or tinkering or experimenting with the technology themselves.” Learning by doing: Setting up wallets, running their own nodes, sending and receiving tiny transactions just to see how it all works.  This brand of self-learning gumption, said Gronowska, even serves as its own kind of credential for employment. Gronowska cheekily calls this “Proof of Work,” meaning that people prove they’ve done their own self-education homework. “They [crypto companies] want to know that you actually understand it,” said Gronowska, who added that when she’s interviewing candidates for jobs, she’ll sometimes ask them to point to a Twitter thread they wrote about a crypto topic, or even a Medium post they felt compelled to write.  Those who are crypto-curious tend to also be just plain curious. The autodidactism can be sprawling. Vitalik Buterin taught himself to speak Chinese, Nick Szabo is both a cryptographer and legal scholar, and Isaiah Jackson is a history buff who’s now geeking-out on the philosophy of Marcus Aurelius. “Anything that I wanted to learn, I always start with myself,” said Jackson. As a high school teacher he tried to impart that mindset to his students, telling them, “If you have a question, ask yourself first. You do realize you have a $1,000 computer in your pocket.”  Sometimes these interests feed directly into a broader understanding of crypto – such as Erik Voorhees devouring books on Austrian Economics – but sometimes they’re just for kicks. “I don’t feel like anything I do is very useful,” said Des Dickerson, the CEO of THNDRgames. She’s kind of joking but kind of not, saying that she gets obsessed with “weird things.”  One of these weird things is “urban snail farming,” as Dickerson explained that she loves to eat escargot but in the United States, “the escargot is [crap].” She was curious to find out the reasons why, then she did a deep dive into the international shipping and transport of snails, and then she even acquired her own snails on the back market to develop her own urban snail farm. (“Don’t come for me, government!” Dickerson said with a laugh.)  Dickerson said she went “so hardcore into this” that she even approached a Michelin-starred restaurant, who invited her to source their snails. Then the coronavirus pandemic happened, she moved, and in the process all her snails died. The point of this little vignette is that Dickerson, like so many crypto autodidacts, is a self-starter who easily gets addicted to learning and questioning and even experimenting. “I get very addicted to things,” she said. “That’s why I don’t do drugs.”  Or consider the autodidacts who believe so strongly in self-teaching – and also in crypto – that they instill this practice in their children, even when traveling around the world as nomads. “As a father, homeschooling allowed me a much closer view of my children’s educational development. I knew what they were learning and could be an active agent in their learning process,” writes Daniel Prince in “Choose Life: The Tools, Tricks, and Hacks of Long-Term Family Travellers, Worldschoolers and Digital Nomads.”  Prince has four kids that he home-schools while he hops around the globe, and he’s also a bitcoin bull who runs a bitcoin podcast. He views home-schooling and bitcoin as linked: They’re both ways of empowering yourself without relying on a centralized (and potentially compromised) institution. “Homeschoolers are bitcoiners that just don't know it yet,” he once tweeted. “And vice versa.”  But for all the virtues of self-learning, is autodidactism itself a kind of privilege? Can you spend hours nerding-out on self-custody wallets and Lightning nodes if you’re a working mom, say, who’s trying to make ends meet? Jackson understands the criticism, but he views the self-education of bitcoin as a way to address privilege and reduce income inequality. “If you get into the space and you think that it’s important, you will find the time to learn about it,” he said. “Thirty minutes in the morning listening to a podcast when you’re working out, or when you’re getting ready, that can help tremendously, and it adds up over time.”  Questions of privilege aside, now the space is at something of an inflection point. As Voorhees pointed out, for most of crypto’s history the only way to truly learn was to teach yourself. This is changing. Universities are now incorporating blockchain and crypto into formalized programs (See: Best Universities for Blockchain 2022) and for the autodidacts this is a source of some ambivalence.  Jackson acknowledges that crypto’s new home in the education system is just a natural reflection of the space’s maturity. It happened in tech, too. “Now it’s regular for somebody to say, ‘I’ve majored in Computer Science,’” he said. “Whereas if you said that in 1992, it didn’t exist. You’d just say, ‘I know what I’m doing because I’ve tinkered around with computers.’” He believes that “once it enters the school system, it’ll just be a formalized way for businesses to have a pipeline of students.”  See also: Introducing Education Week: How to Learn About Web3  Then again, Jackson likes that even if you earn that formal degree in crypto, “that doesn’t guarantee a job. It’s still about, what can you do? You still have to show an impetus to be self-taught.” Gronowska agrees, believing, “It’s not enough to take a course.” And she’s skeptical of the potential biases that could seep into a formalized blockchain education. “Imagine if Greenpeace were to write a course on crypto, or if [the World Economic Forum] were to write a course on crypto,” she said. “I’d rather see the [crypto] industry coming up with their own courses, because they might be a bit more objective.”  Voorhees shares those concerns. “Crypto has been a frontier industry, laughed at or ridiculed by most traditional institutions,” he said, which meant that he had no choice but to be self-taught. “Perhaps there’s an important lesson that anything you’re taught in school is already not cutting edge or innovative. You can learn the status quo from institutions, but nothing radical.”  Ultimately, Voorhees connects self-education with the underlying ethos of bitcoin and decentralization itself. “There are technical skills related to blockchains and cryptography which can absolutely be taught in schools,” he said. “But the soul of this industry is one of rebellion against state-capture of money, and the drive toward rebellion must come from within.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/09/26/autodidacts-welcome,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7700f504cd7ad70960c1d41905cbcbdf37086cd1-3600x2400.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The lender advertises the accounts as ""high-yield,"" and California noted the company offered annual interest rates as high as 36%.  “These crypto interest accounts are securities and are subject to investor protections under the law, including adequate disclosure of the risk involved,” said Clothilde Hewlett, commissioner of California’s Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. California claimed that as of July 31, more than 18,000 of its residents had $175 million in such accounts.  Crypto firms BlockFi, Voyager Digital and Celsius Network Inc. have been subjected to similar regulatory actions. While BlockFi resolved state and federal actions with a $100 million settlement, lenders Voyager and Celsius have been immersed in bankruptcy, with Celsius shareholders filing last week to secure a share of the firm’s remaining assets.

The LUNC price jumped as much as 60% on the news, reaching as high as $0.00032, according to cryptocurrency price tracker CoinGecko. The token was changing hands at around $0.00029 at press time.  The sudden rally caught many traders by surprise, especially because many of them had bet that the LUNC price would fall on the news that Interpol had issued a “red notice” for Terra’s founder, Do Kwon. Some $1.5 million of short positions have been liquidated during the day, the highest in at least three months, according to Coinglass.  The Terra ecosystem’s collapse in May was one of the most dramatic implosions in the crypto market. It wiped out $60 billion in market value and caused some crypto firms to become insolvent. Earlier this month, South Korean authorities issued an arrest warrant for Kwon on charges of fraud.  Many developers who were building applications on the original-and-now-abandoned blockchain have moved over to the newly rebooted Terra blockchain or to other networks like Polygon or Kadena that are seen as having more staying power. At least one analyst has suggested that LUNC is now a “meme coin,” with few use cases beyond providing traders with speculation and quick profits (or losses).  Read more: Luna (LUNA) vs. Luna Classic (LUNC): What Is the Difference?  Earlier this month, the LUNC token surged in anticipation of a community-approved plan to reduce the token’s hyperinflated supply.  The so-called “supply burn plan” aims to destroy – burn in crypto terms – 1.2% of every LUNC transaction on the blockchain. The mechanism doesn't apply to buying and selling tokens on exchanges, but some crypto exchanges such as MEXC voluntarily decided to adopt the supply reduction mechanism.  The burn scheme Binance just announced, however, may have less of an impact than many traders hope.  According to a statement, the crypto exchange will destroy the equivalent of the trading fees when a trader sells or buys LUNC. Traders on Binance may opt for applying the 1.2% “burn fee” voluntarily. Given that trading fees on Binance range from 0.1% to as low as 0.02% for large traders, the burn rate is just a fraction of the 1.2% transaction burn rate.  Traders who move the most volume on the exchange, such as market makers, are unlikely to voluntarily choose the 1.2% fees, crypto trader Ogle pointed out in a Twitter post. Binance’s burn scheme “is almost totally useless to LUNC folks, but they don’t realize it,” he told CoinDesk.",POSITIVE,LUNC,EXCHANGE | LUNC | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/26/luna-classic-remnant-of-terra-collapse-jumps-60-as-binance-unveils-burn-scheme,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b9c489fb091796801bf1630331fd08d333a7eaa1-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411353,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNI66,1664213731,Does the US Government Have a Monopoly on Trust?,"In remarks earlier this month, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler argued the crypto economy “will not take off unless you have some trust."" Then, last week, in a report issued in response to the White House Executive Order on crypto, the U.S. Department of the Treasury noted that one benefit of a potential Federal Reserve-created central bank digital currency (CBDC) is that it would be issued by a “trusted source.”  Implicit in both statements is a belief that trust is automatically achieved via the involvement of a government entity.  As someone who has worked at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the USAID and New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) – often with the goal of supporting responsible innovation – I’ve observed first-hand how government intervention, including through regulation, can help ensure the integrity of financial markets, prevent bad actors from harming consumers and incentivize entrepreneurship and innovation in financial services.  Matthew Homer, a CoinDesk columnist, is executive in residence at Nyca Partners. He previously served as executive deputy superintendent at New York State Department of Financial Services.  Still, I’ve become increasingly concerned by statements like the ones quoted above that assume that public trust in government can always be taken for granted. In my experience, trust in government-imposed solutions is not a natural endowment but a privilege that government regulators must earn and actively maintain.  Public concerns  One of the most intellectually exciting aspects of crypto is the opportunity to revisit the foundational principles regarding money, including the source of our trust: Why, for example, do we trust that a piece of paper with a president’s face printed on it has value? Ask most people, and those who have an answer at all will likely say it’s because our money is issued by the government, and the banks and intermediaries that manage it are subject to strict laws and oversight.  See also: If Money Is Speech, CBDCs Should Be Tools for Freedom | Opinion  But that sort of trust in the government can’t be taken for granted, a fact that has been documented by the Edelman Trust Barometer, an annual report on a regular survey of societal indicators of trust. According to the most recent edition, 48% of people globally say that government is a dividing force in society, compared to only 36% who say it is a unifying force. Government is also ranked behind business, non-governmental organizations (NGO) and the media in the perceived ability to solve societal problems. And “government leaders,” in particular, are trusted the least of any type of societal leader. In the United States, specifically, only 39% of people express trust in government.  What happens if public trust in the government continues to decline, as the Pew Research Center says it has done for the past 60 years? Will peoples’ trust in financial products or services still be as heavily influenced by whether or not the provider of those products or services is regulated by the government?  As a former financial services regulator, I’ve become convinced that the public’s trust in our traditional financial system is coming under significant threat as a result of the loss of public confidence in government writ-large and in government-regulated institutions like banks.  The striking successes of cryptocurrency illustrate the fact that this threat is not illusory: If people don’t trust their government or government-supervised private institutions to look out for them, they can, and will, vote with their feet and turn to alternative products and services that they believe are more deserving of their trust – and money.  Historian Yuval Harari has said that money is “​​a system of mutual trust, and not just any system of mutual trust: Money is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised.” This innovation has allowed us to move beyond the limitations of a barter society, permitting things like urbanization, specialization of labor and commerce at a distance. It has thus made possible the co-mingling of different peoples – unconnected by familial, religious, or other bonds that might normally engender trust – giving rise to the complex, mobile civilization we know today.  Trustless applications  If trust is key to determining the success of a financial or economic system, and we are seeing an enduring deterioration of public trust in governments both in the U.S. and abroad, how can crypto help fill the void? I believe there are at least four key considerations that will determine whether or not crypto is an ephemeral experiment or the next great system of mutual trust in financial services:  First is the reliability and security of the crypto products themselves. Do the products, whether centralized or decentralized in their design, promote trust through transparency and resilience? Are they reliable and predictable? What safeguards are in place to give the public confidence that they won’t lose their money to a rug pull or a governance hack? While bleeding-edge crypto enthusiasts may have been happy to undertake their own due diligence (giving rise to the term DYOR), cryptocurrency is not going to fill the trust void if everyday users have to audit lines of computer code or peruse Discord or Telegram threads to understand whether a product is secure and reliable.  Second is the public’s faith in the competence and honesty of those who build and maintain the ecosystem, whether they are developers, infrastructure providers, virtual asset service providers (VASP), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), investors or others. Even if it is a goal to automate as much of the system as possible and distribute ownership and control across as many people as possible through smart contracts, recent experience has shown us that crypto remains subject to the fallibility of human beings. What can be done to objectively monitor those participating in the ecosystem and shed light on those actors who exercise a disproportionately large amount of influence over it?  Third is the reaction to crypto by government policymakers and regulators. Will government view crypto as a threat to the centrally controlled monetary system and use statutes designed for a bygone era, and often ill-suited to the realities of cryptocurrency markets, to stifle innovation? Will it focus only on crypto’s shortcomings, ignoring its promise, to justify draconian rules that scare away entrepreneurs and venture capital? Or will policymakers take a holistic, forward-looking approach, recognizing that crypto may have a very constructive role to play particularly if trust in the government continues to erode?  See also: The Infuriating Patchwork of Crypto Regulations Is Good for Crypto | Opinion  The fourth factor determining whether crypto emerges as a lasting system of mutual trust may depend on how society is changing and the preferences of the next generations of consumers. This is undoubtedly the most important part of the equation, even if it is the one least frequently discussed. America’s population is changing. Gen Z, or those born after 1996, is the most racially and ethnically diverse generation in American history. And the first to grow up in an entirely digital age. It may also be the generation most consistently failed by the dominant institutions of its time.  Just consider what this generation has lived through: 9/11, the Great Recession, the alarm bells of climate change, the scourge of opioids, school shootings, COVID-19, record-high inflation, the bifurcation of society into red and blue communities and the rolling back of women’s rights. Not surprisingly, this generation is also one of the least trusting in institutions generally – including but not limited to the government.  Decentering institutions  Years from now, it would not be surprising to look back at the early 2020s as the time when consumers started to place more trust in decentralized software to manage their money than in government-regulated financial intermediaries.  Based on this framing of the issues, two realities are clear: Money is inherently a social construct built on trust, and public confidence in the institutions that historically have provided that trust is at a monumental low, and continues to decline.  Will crypto be the solution that overcomes this gap and becomes a trusted provider of everyday financial products and services? While it is likely still too early to answer this question, it seems clear the financial services system of 2030 and 2050 will look different from what exists today, and that trust in that system may be motivated by very different factors.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Matthew Homer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/09/26/does-the-us-government-have-a-monopoly-on-trust,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54cdc6cdf0b8c5012bad183e960969c3657587fd-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In the SEC’s investigation of Friedman LLP’s audits of two publicly traded companies, Chinese grocery chain iFresh and another, unnamed company, the auditor was found to have lied about conducting its audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.  The SEC’s order, issued Friday, details sloppy accounting practices that were common at Friedman LLP from 2015 to 2020, including its failure to “respond to fraud risks” and “exercise due professional care and professional skepticism,” among other things, the order said.  Though the SEC’s order against Friedman LLP makes no mention of Tether, the stablecoin issuer retained the New York-based accounting firm from May 2017 to January 2018, when the professional relationship was “dissolved.” At the time, a representative for Tether told CoinDesk that the firm was fired for not providing an audit quickly enough.  The question of Tether’s reserves is one of the crypto industry’s most persistent mysteries, spurred on by the stablecoin issuer’s own secrecy. Though Tether has taken recent steps toward increased transparency, publishing semiregular attestations verifying its reserves, it has closely guarded other information about its holdings, including their actual composition.  Last year, Tether paid $18.5 million to settle a 22-month investigation by the New York attorney general’s office (NYAG) into whether it sought to cover up the loss of $850 million in customer and corporate funds held by a payment processor.  Tether’s attorneys have also petitioned the New York Supreme Court to prevent the NYAG from providing the public with documents detailing its reserves, after CoinDesk filed a Freedom of Information Law request seeking access to some of the documents generated by NYAG’s investigation.  In its settlement agreement with the SEC, Friedman LLP has agreed to train its staff in proper auditing procedures, and will pay a $1 million civil penalty and $564,138 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | USDT,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/26/tethers-former-auditor-fined-1m-by-sec-for-sloppy-accounting,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0a54c0be88b38a823128a145c8b4854b0cdf6607-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422262,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0jRBh,1664208435,"New Cosmos White Paper Revamps Cosmos Hub, ATOM Token","A new white paper released at the Cosmoverse conference in Medellín, Colombia, proposes major expansions to the utility of the Cosmos Hub – the blockchain that sits at the center of the Cosmos blockchain ecosystem. The paper also spells out a new vision for ATOM, the Cosmos Hub’s native token.  Today, the Hub’s primary role is to serve as a template for building blockchains into the Cosmos “interchain” – a web of individual blockchains that can easily share information and assets.  The Cosmos Hub 2.0 white paper outlines a revamped role for the Hub as the heart of interchain security – meaning other chains will be able to use the Hub to secure their own networks. The white paper also proposes changes to the utility and issuance schedule of ATOM – changes that the paper’s authors think will back up its informal role as an index of the broader Cosmos family of blockchains.  ATOM was trading at $14.60 at press time, down 1.43% in the past 24 hours.  With its newly refined vision, the “Cosmos Hub is taking its place within the interchain,” says Ethan Buchman, the Cosmos co-founder and head of Cosmos research and development shop Informal Systems. “[The Hub] is still not going to dominate the interchain or own the whole interchain or bring everyone under its umbrella,” explained Buchman, but “it's trying to offer services to the larger interchain that help enable it, help support it, [and] help it thrive and grow.”  The Cosmos Hub  The Cosmos Hub has, historically, struggled with a bit of an identity crisis. People can stake the Hub’s native ATOM token to help secure the network, but the network itself isn’t really used for much.  “You would maybe just copy and paste all of the Cosmos Hub codebase, and then you would add your feature to it,” explained Billy Rennekamp, the Cosmos Hub product lead at Interchain GmbH, which helps fund the development of the wider Cosmos ecosystem.  The Hub was the only Cosmos chain when it launched in 2019, but its code has since been used as a template by dozens of other interconnected blockchains, each dedicated to a specific product or use case.  The app chain Osmosis, for example, used the Cosmos Hub’s code as a template to enable decentralized finance (DeFi) activities like exchanging between currencies. Regen, another app-chain, used the Cosmos Hub’s code as a model for its on-chain carbon credit market. Terra, the ill-fated stablecoin operator, was a Cosmos chain, too.  As the wider Cosmos ecosystem has grown, the Cosmos community has rejected changes to the Hub’s code that might sully its role as a clean template for other chains to build upon. The community has also shunned upgrades that would place the Hub on a pedestal relative to other Cosmos chains – the fear being that such upgrades could challenge the “sovereignty” of other chains in the ecosystem.  As a result of its conservative track record, if Cosmos as a whole is a neighborhood, the Hub has been relegated to the role of a model home – a cookie-cutter example of what a Cosmos chain should look like sans any real utility or inhabitants.  Rennekamp uses this analogy of a model home to describe where the Hub is headed next: “At the beginning, it's the only home in the neighborhood. And once there's a flourishing neighborhood around they might decide to convert it to a school, or a police station or something that's specifically valuable to the neighborhood, rather than just a proof of concept for other houses.”  Interchain security  The Cosmos 2.0 white paper proposes interchain security, an upcoming Cosmos feature, as a core element of the Hub’s value proposition moving forward.  All Cosmos chains use a proof-of-stake system similar to the one that Ethereum transitioned to earlier this month. Under this system, chains are secured by validators: people that stake a chain’s native token in order to help process transactions. Osmosis validators, for instance, stake OSMO tokens. Regen users stake REGEN tokens.  Read more: What Is Proof-of-Stake?  Chains are generally considered more secure if they have a large, diverse pool of validators. If a single attacker amasses enough of a given network’s stake, they can potentially make malicious network upgrades or meddle with how transactions are processed.  By virtue of its maturity and visibility as the first Cosmos chain, the Hub has generated a more diverse validator set than any of its Cosmos peers. With the launch of interchain security on the Cosmos Hub, other Cosmos chains will be able to borrow the Hub’s validators to secure their own networks rather than find their own.  “Interchain security is not only like a high market cap, for preventing attacks,” explained Rennekamp. “I think, actually in the long run, the real value of interchain security is [being] legally, defensibly decentralized.”  According to Rennekamp, “I think the days are numbered for [layer one blockchains] to be launched, and be legally classified as decentralized networks. And I think that the Cosmos Hub has a really great position through its integrity, history and degrees of decentralization to provide decentralization as a service.”  Increasing ATOM’s value  The white paper also introduces mechanics aimed toward accruing value to ATOM, the Cosmos Hub’s native token.  Today, speculators trade ATOM like an index of the Cosmos ecosystem as a whole, but there’s not much rhyme or reason as to why this needs to be the case. According to the new white paper, the investment narrative behind ATOM changes when the Cosmos Hub – with the ATOM token at its core – is used to secure a wider swath of the Cosmos ecosystem via interchain security.  Read more: Cosmos' ATOM Gains, Bucks Post-Merge Lull on Outlook for New Uses, Better Security  For chains that choose to borrow the Hub’s security, said Buchman, “it gives them direct alignment with Cosmos with the ATOM. It allows them to inherit the security of the ATOM and be part of this sort of economic community being built around the Cosmos blockchain, the ATOM token, and the superior security that that chain provides.”  Another way the ATOM token will accrue more value, according to the white paper, is by leveraging liquid staking.  ATOM holders can earn interest today by staking their tokens with validators, but doing so involves locking the tokens up in an address on the blockchain where – at least for a time – they cannot be sold. Third-party apps offer “liquid staking” solutions that free up users to trade their staked assets via a derivative token representing their stake.  The Cosmos Hub will soon bake liquid staking into the core of the network’s code. “With the native liquid staking module, it provides a better [user experience] for entering one of those liquid staking providers,” explained Buchman.  “Now that the [ATOM] token can start to become more liquid, even while it's providing security, we can similarly start to offer new ways to connect the security and liquidity of the ATOM token to other tokens that are launching in the ecosystem,” he continued.  The white paper also details other changes to ATOM, including major long-term reductions to the number of tokens that are issued to the network.

And sign up for First Mover, our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) was trading up slightly on the day after reaching lows of $18,635 over the weekend as concerns over a potential global recession triggered by higher interest rates and energy shortages heightened.  The British pound crashed to a record low against the U.S. dollar on Monday as fears grew about the stability of U.K. government finances. British government officials said that the Bank of England may need to step in with an emergency rate increase to calm market nerves about the government’s economic plans.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down 1% on the day to about $1,300 after hitting lows of $1,200 over the weekend.  Altcoins also struggled Monday with Algorand’s ALGO down 7% and Chainlink’s LINK down 3.5%.  In the news, Bank of America said in a research report that cryptocurrencies continue to act as risk assets. The report said that positive signs of an eventual recovery include stablecoin inflows.  Last week, those inflows jumped 58% from the previous week to $490 million, the report said, as “real-world use cases like payments/remittances are adopted and real-world data providers like decentralized oracle networks increase functionality.”  And the Reserve Bank of Australia is expecting to complete its central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot program by mid-2023, according to a white paper published on Monday.  The purpose of the testing is to ""explore innovative use cases"" that could be supported by the issuance of a CBDC, a media release said.

Market Moves  Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Hits Lows on Less Institutional Interest  By Lyllah Ledesma  The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) discount, a key crypto market metric, has sunk to a record low as institutional interest in Greyscale wanes.  The trust, often referred to by its stock-trading symbol GBTC, is a type of investment vehicle that allows U.S. investors to gain exposure to price movements of BTC.  On Monday, GBTC was trading at a 35.18% discount compared with the value of its underlying assets. GBTC began trading at a discount after the first North American bitcoin exchange-traded fund in Canada in February 2021 launched.  Grayscale, whose parent company Digital Currency Group owns CoinDesk, attempted to convert its fund into an ETF in June 2021, but the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rejected the application. Grayscale filed a lawsuit against the regulatory agency shortly after that.

42393763,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpAmjZ,1664200862,CFTC’s Ooki DAO Action Shatters Illusion of Regulator-Proof Protocol,"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed and settled charges last week against a blockchain protocol and its founders that could have an enormous ripple effect on the crypto industry.  At first blush, the action seems straightforward: Blockchain protocol bZeroX (bZx) and two of its founders were accused of offering illegal, off-exchange tokenized margin trading and lending services. The company and founders Tom Bean and Kyle Kistner were charged with operating as an unregistered futures commission merchant (FCM) and failing to meet Bank Secrecy Act requirements for gathering customer information.  Bean and Kistner settled for a relative slap on the wrist – a $250,000 civil monetary penalty and a promise not to violate the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) or other CFTC regulations again. Though violating the Bank Secrecy Act can sometimes land lawbreakers in prison, Bean and Kistner did not face any criminal charges at this time.  The CFTC’s action against bZeroX was fairly routine, except for one thing – the CFTC filed a simultaneous federal civil enforcement action against Ooki DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) they say was a “successor to bZeroX that operated the same software protocol … [and violated] the same laws” as bZeroX and its founders.  The CFTC’s enforcement action against Ooki DAO is the first of its kind, and crypto lawyers – including one of the sitting CFTC commissioners – are concerned that it sets a legal precedent for DAO regulation that could have a significant impact on the wider crypto industry.  Piercing the veil of decentralization  In the CFTC’s complaint, the agency argues that bZeroX and Ooki DAO are essentially the same organization, despite Ooki DAO’s language of decentralization. After operating from June 2019 to August 2021, bZeroX transferred control of its protocol to Ooki DAO.  The CFTC seems to take particular issue with Bean and Kistner’s repeated representations of the DAO-ification of their protocol as something that would put it beyond the reach of regulators.  “By transferring control to a DAO, bZeroX’s founders touted to bZeroX community members the operations would be enforcement-proof” the complaint reads. “The bZx Founders were wrong, however. DAOs are not immune from enforcement and may not violate the law with impunity.”  New York-based crypto lawyer Max Dilendorf told CoinDesk the CFTC’s position does not come as a surprise to those paying attention to crypto regulation trends.  “This notion that a founding team can hide behind a veil of decentralization, it falls flat on its face,” Dilendorf said. “Even if a company or a protocol is able to reach the requisite level of decentralization, the regulators will still be going after the individual founders if the product that is being offered on those smart contracts violates either CFTC or [Securities and Exchange Commission] regulations.”  Though, as an attorney, Dilendorf found the action predictable, he acknowledged that it might surprise DAO participants.  Speaking to CoinDesk from the Messari Mainnet conference in New York City, Dilendorf said he was “blown away” by the number of people speaking on DAO-related panels at the conference that were either unaware or did not acknowledge existing guidelines from the SEC on DAO governance.  “The [SEC] sort of rolled out guidance as to how a governance protocol should look if the DAO were to take a position that it was fully decentralized, literally going step-by-step,” Dilendorf said. “I don’t see a single DAO out there that was able to hit all those issues and comply with guidance… It’s shocking.”  Who is responsible for a DAO’s bad deeds?  What did surprise many crypto lawyers, however, is that the CFTC’s complaint indicates the regulator sees all voting governance token holders as potentially culpable members of a DAO.  Drew Hinkes, a Miami-based crypto lawyer, told CoinDesk that this distinction was not made in the SEC’s 2017 action against The DAO – the only other regulatory action related to an unincorporated DAO.  “On one hand, it’s a very appealing way to determine who should be thought of as ‘governing’ a DAO, given that there is a readily available forensic record on a blockchain of which wallet addresses voted their tokens,” Hinkes said.  However, Hinkes also stressed that such a crude method of determining involvement would also capture token holders who may have voted against potentially illegal actions, or who only voted on irrelevant things, like what to name the DAO.  This issue was at the heart of a dissenting statement from CFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger, who called the enforcement action “arbitrary and unfair.”  “The Commission’s approach … affirmatively disincentivizes voting participation in DAO governance generally – and particularly those who may want to vote in a manner that effectuates change to comply with the law,” Mersinger wrote. “The Commission’s approach will have a chilling effect that discourages voting, thereby hindering good governance and the development of a culture of compliance in this setting.”  Though the enforcement action opens the door to who can be held responsible for a DAOs bad deeds, how to identify those participants – many of whom are pseudonymous even to fellow members – is another question.  “This was an easy case for the CFTC, because they already knew who the two founders were for the purposes of attaching liability, but it obviously has far-reaching implications for future cases,” Illinois-based crypto lawyer Grant Gulovsen told CoinDesk.  “At the same time, if the authorities in question really wanted to find out who the members [of a DAO] were, I think they could,” Gulovsen said.  ‘Regulation through enforcement’  Many in the crypto industry have decried the CFTC’s action against Ooki DAO as a form of “regulation through enforcement” – an accusation that has more often than not been lobbied at the SEC, which has been engaged in a years-long tug-of-war with the CFTC for the role of top crypto regulator.  Jake Chervinsky, head of policy at crypto lobbying firm the Blockchain Association, called the Ooki DAO action “the most egregious example of regulation by enforcement in the history of crypto. … The CFTC has put [the SEC] to shame.”  In her dissenting statement, Commissioner Mersinger echoed the industry group’s concerns, calling it “regulation by enforcement, plain and simple.”  While, as Dilendorf pointed out, the action was a “wake-up call” for crypto founders who think a DAO is a shield from regulation, attorneys have also pointed out that it’s a wake-up call for industry participants who have groused about crypto regulation under the SEC, assuming that the CFTC would make a more favorable regulator.  “The fact that the first real enforcement action brought against an unincorporated DAO was by the CFTC, rather than the SEC, is somewhat surprising as the CFTC has generally been viewed as being less aggressive in bringing enforcement actions against participants in the digital asset space than the SEC,” said Glen Chen, a Los Angeles-based attorney at international law firm Ropes & Gray.  “This is a reminder that merely swapping regulators won’t absolve all issues,” attorney Collins Belton tweeted.  Not settled yet  Though most crypto lawyers CoinDesk spoke with agreed that the CFTC’s enforcement action against Ooki DAO could, and likely would, have broader implications for DAO regulation, they also stressed that it was just one action – and not even a settled one, at that.  “There is a tendency to overreact to the latest enforcement action, especially one that appears novel,” Hinkes said. This complaint represents the “best version of the facts as to one specific claim, and those facts are not established at this stage. It is unclear how much of what the CFTC alleges will be accepted by the court.”  “It's too early to conclude that DAOs or other decentralized ventures that govern service protocols and other similar technology systems are dead simply because of this one action,” Hinkes added.  Gulovsen also cast doubt on wider concerns that the action against Ooki DAO would dissuade people from joining or participating in DAOs.  “As long as the DAO isn’t doing anything which violates any laws that would subject the members to personal liability, then it shouldn’t be an issue,” he said. “[The enforcement action] is a big deal, but only to the extent that I believe a lot of folks had gotten complacent because this sort of case hadn’t really been in the headlines yet. Now it has.”  Many people involved with DAOs share the same views as the bZx founders about decentralization making them enforcement-proof, Gulovsen said.  “And just like the CFTC said, ‘That’s wrong.’”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/26/cftcs-ooki-dao-action-shatters-illusion-of-regulator-proof-protocol,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b22ef584b1979b618ea77422ba322981ccf4efa2-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This notification will be revised every week until further notice with the precise quantity of LUNC to be burnt, its equivalent in USDT, and the on-chain transaction ID.

42393936,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brdCyZ,1664192881,Best Universities for Blockchain 2022: Where In the World Is the Most Research Being Produced?,"CoinDesk’s 2022 Best Universities for Blockchain Rankings, which CoinDesk announced this week, examines a university’s blockchain educational infrastructure using four key metrics: campus blockchain offerings, scholarly impact, employment and industry outcomes and academic reputation.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Education Week  To get a more granular view of the blockchain ecosystem, we mapped out specific datasets to see what insights we could glean from individual dimensions of our research. One of the most interesting was research paper concentration. When looking at where research is being published, Asia dominates the landscape – and it’s not even close. Sixty percent of the top 10 paper producers are located in Asia, and out of the 24 Asian schools that are in the top-100 paper producers, only seven of them are outside of the top 50.  Read More: The Best Universities for Blockchain 2022  When taking this more holistic view of research, the U.S. arguably falls short of expectations with a grand total of zero schools in the top-20 paper producers. The first U.S. school to appear on the list is MIT at #23, and only four other U.S. schools even crack the top 50 (at #36, #38, #46 and #47).  In terms of regions punching far above their weight in scholarly impact, Oceania, and more specifically Australia, has a strong showing in scholarly impact. Five Australian schools show up in the top 20 schools by research paper publications, about half the rate of Asia despite having less than 2% of the population (an imperfect metric, but a fascinating one). Schools like University of New South Wales and University of Technology, Sydney are in the top 10 schools by paper publications, with UNSW registering as second overall, beaten only by Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

42393947,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brdDnr,1664192804,Best Universities for Blockchain 2022: CoinDesk’s Methodology,"The third year of the CoinDesk Blockchain University Rankings is still, at heart, an attempt to both recognize the role that academic research has played in the development of blockchain technology as well as quantify the impact of individual schools. Our goal has not wavered in these three years: offer the most rigorous and nuanced window into universities’ impact on the blockchain field. Again this year, we’ve ranked schools across the globe with a final total of 240 universities, 15 of which came from outside nominations.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Education Week  Above all, we want to ensure that these rankings do what they’re intended to do: offer a holistic snapshot of the intersection between this transformative technology and institutions of higher education. It is our hope that, rather than being seen as canonical, a transparent, intellectually defensible ranking can help condense what ends up being an incredible amount of difficult-to-find information (with innumerable factors) down into a more manageable format.  Sample size  Our official sample size for these rankings, at 240 individual schools, is not nearly the total number of universities that exist around the world. To determine which institutions to focus on, we added schools to the list according to their ability to meet any one of three criteria.  First, we included any school that was listed in the top 150 of any one of the U.S. News and World Reports (USNWR) Best Global Universities (2022), the QS World University Rankings (2022), the ShanghaiRanking's Academic Ranking of World Universities (2022), or THE World University Rankings (2022). This gave us a large initial sample.  Read More: The Best Universities for Blockchain 2022  This setup, however, if limited to just this criteria, could pose a problem: What if a lower-ranked school (as judged by USNWR, QS, ARWU or THE) is doing amazing work, but fails to be considered simply because a few outside sources happened to overlook them in their global rankings? This is far from a desirable outcome. On the other hand, we simply don’t have the resources to closely examine every school in existence, especially when relatively few of them are engaged in the kind of impactful blockchain work that is likely to lead to a place on our rankings.  This might be a good time to give a nod to schools that are vocational in nature, that aim to prepare their students for job skills including blockchain operational ability that are intended to enable a solid middle class life. These schools may not rank high in scholarly impact or global reputation, which likely prevents them from being captured by our initial screening process, but they are doing a great service to their students and society, and their existence should not go unmentioned.  To balance these considerations, similar to last year we added an additional criteria: We also included a call for any school, anywhere in the world, to request inclusion/consideration in our rankings. By opening up our criteria but placing the burden of requesting to be included on the schools themselves, we were able to remove artificial limitations on which schools were considered, while simultaneously maintaining a high level of confidence that any school that took the affirmative step of asking to be evaluated would ultimately be worth our time and resources to examine closely.  The 240 institutions that constituted our sample this year represent some of the best schools in existence today, including a mix of large, traditionally “elite” research institutions and smaller schools, from public to private, from free to expensive, with every continent (with the exception of Antarctica) represented.  Methodology  To determine final scores, we looked at four primary categories: (1) an institution’s strength in research and academic contributions to advancing the field; (2) the existing blockchain offerings on campus, whether in the form of classes, educational centers, clubs, etc.; (3) employment and industry outcomes; and (4) overall academic reputation.  Each category comprises multiple sub-categories, offering a holistic picture of a university’s presence in the blockchain space. For a final score, we assigned points to each institution proportional to their performance in each category, and normalized their final point totals on a scale from 0-100.  Scholarly impact  To determine a school’s scholarly impact score, we relied primarily on the Clarivate Web of Science database. We took the total number of publications (all subjects) from each school, and narrowed them to include only blockchain- or cryptocurrency-related papers published between 2018-2022 (including forthcoming papers slated for 2023). From this set we generated citation reports and created subsets in which the first author of the publication was affiliated with the university in question.  Read More: Best Universities for Blockchain 2022: Where In the World Is the Most Research Being Produced?  The resulting data gave us the key metrics of (1) total blockchain research papers published by university affiliates, (2) how often these papers were cited, and rough numbers on (3) how often the primary researcher on a paper comes from a given institution (the “first author” convention being, of course, discipline-dependent).  Raw numbers, however, don’t always tell the full story. A bigger school with a larger faculty and a hefty endowment, may be putting out more blockchain research overall (while still managing to devote a relatively small percentage of its resources to the field), while a tiny school that dedicates a much more impressive percentage of its overall resources to blockchain research may end up with fewer papers simply due to a smaller overall headcount.  To account for this, we also normalized each data point (where applicable) against the total institutional output. When normalized in this way, a smaller university that is devoting a larger proportion of its research to blockchain will be rewarded relative to a more massive university who is able to pump out a greater quantity of research with less investment. In recognition of the fact that both raw output and targeted output are valuable metrics, both are factored into our rankings, along with the aggregated H-Index of a school’s blockchain publications. For anyone interested in reproducing our dataset, please ensure that a) you have full access to the Web of Knowledge and all Clarivate subscriptions; and b) use our query to filter the results: “cryptocurrenc* OR ‘smart contrac*’ OR blockchai* OR bitcoi* OR ethereum OR stablecoi*”  Campus blockchain offerings  To arrive at a school’s blockchain offerings score we examined multiple facets of their existing campus infrastructure. Campus course offerings are the largest single subcategory that we looked at. The number of available classes (especially when spread over multiple departments, providing an opportunity for a more robust education) shows a deep investment into the space both in the present and for the future. Faculty must be hired, curricula must be developed and administrative buy-in must be achieved. These are not done on a whim, and are usually quite permanent.  The second-largest factor in our rankings is the presence of a dedicated blockchain research center, although we also separately considered smaller initiatives and student-run clubs. Research centers and initiatives often offer unique opportunities for students to get involved in academic work or obtain hands-on experience, and can serve as a gravity well for novel ideas and thinkers (especially when these entities take the additional step of organizing conferences, summits, or other educational events). Research centers, initiatives and clubs all allow students, faculty and the larger community to connect with other enthusiasts, and tend to provide a crucial tether between academia and industry.  Lastly, to round out this category, we gathered data on the nascent but ever-growing set of universities who offer blockchain-related degrees, whether at the graduate or undergraduate level, and sometimes as a concentration within another degree. As a whole, the Campus Blockchain Offerings category is the most consequential component of our methodology.  Employment and industry outcomes  A university’s ability to place students into relevant jobs is an important metric for two reasons: One, it says something about an institution’s cache in the industry, either due to name recognition, personal connections, or institutional pipelines; and two, this is of particular importance to current and incoming students.  A student’s primary goal in obtaining a college education is, after all, often to secure a job in industry. To discover which schools are placing the most graduates in the blockchain field, we looked at the LinkedIn footprint of the largest and most influential companies in the space, as well as their thousands and thousands of employees. To mitigate biases we factored in both raw and normalized numbers wherever possible. Raw numbers are useful for highlighting schools that are placing a high number of graduates into jobs, but larger schools in larger countries will tend to have an advantage simply because of sheer size.  To gather qualitative data, we also surveyed industry stakeholders and other non-students, non-academics to get a sense of how institutions are (subjectively) viewed by those who consider themselves to be outside of academia. This data was quantified numerically, as was information about the number of active industry partnerships (including sponsored research) maintained by each university.  Academic reputation  In a perfect world, rankings would emphasize merit, and anonymized, quantifiable data would be sufficient to judge a university's impact in the blockchain space. Realistically, however, the intangibles of a school have an outsized impact on everything from a student’s job prospects, to their ability to get a foot in the door of an internship, to the caliber of speaker that will spend their limited time giving a talk at any given school.  To pretend that reputation doesn’t matter, that history is insignificant, is to do a disservice to our rankings. The effect of a school’s academic reputation on our methodology, however, is dwarfed by every other category except for cost, reflecting both the recent shift away from credentialism and the greater weight that we assign to more tangible, productive metrics.  To determine an institution’s reputation score, we looked at two criteria: (a) existing, overall reputation as calculated by USNWR, THE, ARWU, and QS; and (b) reputation as determined by our own qualitative surveys, which asked both practicing academics and current students to evaluate schools. This data was split according to whether it came from a student or an academic, and quantified numerically.  Similar to last year, there are two common threads in our methodology. First, in keeping with our goal of rigor, defensibility and reproducibility, we used externally verified, quantitative data (e.g., Web of Science) whenever such data was available and normalized this data where appropriate to add as much nuance into our rankings as possible. When we required qualitative data, we sent out open, public, shareable surveys through all available channels and did our best not to limit participation in any way, constructive or otherwise.  Second, we made every attempt to examine each data point from as many angles as possible. As is often the case, any given data point can be seen as a positive in some situations but a negative when seen through a different lens. Normalization is one tool to combat this, but so are things like common sense and a dispassionate analysis of the landscape. Data tells a story, and our goal was to let our data tell as complete a story as we could.  Help us improve our data  In important ways, rankings are incredibly useful for showing very specific data or reducing large amounts of information down into a digestible format, but are also both narrow and inherently malleable (yet another flaw, but perhaps one that can be discussed down here as it’s slightly, but only slightly, less panic-inducing).  Even small changes to the methodology can have outsized effects on the final result, as can outlier data or even researcher-introduced errors. To state that rankings are vulnerable to criticisms of subjectivity and malleability is not intended to marginalize our data or the larger project at hand; rather, we hope that by highlighting the limitations of our output, these rankings will be more useful to a greater number of individuals.  In the open-source spirit, we’d also like to reiterate our commitment to integrity and data transparency. We are more than happy to discuss our methodology, share data, answer questions and address concerns. Interested readers are encouraged to contact Jeanhee Kim.  We hope that these rankings serve as the foundation for a living, breathing resource that goes well beyond an ordered list of schools. We have started and will continue to do this research, but we’re not naive enough to hold the impression that we can build this particular monument alone.  But we believe this resource illuminating one small corner of the blockchain universe has tremendous value – for students seeking a more traditional path into the industry, for academics hoping to collaborate with like-minded individuals, for companies wondering where specific research is being done. As a first step, we’ve started filling out profiles for some of the top universities, but we’d eventually like to have every school represented.  Students can contribute to this by checking their school(s) and having an authorized university representative (e.g., a member of the media/communications/etc. team) contact us if any information is outdated or missing, or if their school does not yet have a profile. Individuals can help by highlighting important research and projects or novel approaches to blockchain education. Schools can help by examining these rankings and using them as a signal for how to improve. Ultimately, what we can all do to help the space as a whole is simple: devote resources to educating students, faculty, and the community about blockchain technology.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Reuben Youngblom,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/09/26/best-universities-for-blockchain-2022-coindesks-methodology,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/09b0852aebc48f5c11d4d4a0974ba7ba1bbfd7f2-1500x1043.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42393940,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brdDDx,1664192779,Best Universities for Blockchain 2022,"CoinDesk announces our 2022 ranking of the 50 universities with the biggest impact on blockchain. We examined each of 240 schools based on metrics that include the number and influence of its research publications, the number of courses, degrees, conferences, clubs and industry partnerships or grants, where graduates get jobs, its reputation and many other measurements.

Read more about how we defined and measured ""scholarly impact,"" ""campus blockchain offerings,"" ""employment and industry outcomes"" and ""academic reputation.""  CoinDesk embarked on this months-long project even as well-known rankings of universities are being scrutinized, especially after Columbia University's data was called into question on the U.S. News and World Report's (USNWR) 2022 and 2023 lists.  Our methodology, while not perfect, avoids some of the problems massive university rankings often do. CoinDesk pulled its own data from publicly available databases and the websites of the universities themselves, rather than relying on self-reported responses from our sample of 240 schools. While our data retrieval method could be incomplete, it's unlikely it could be manipulated.  We also had to reflect on the meaning of ranking universities for their research and pedagogy in the emerging technology of blockchain. Our readers are unlikely to be teens – or their parents – looking for the best schools to attend as undergraduates. We know our audience to be older and with jobs, whether in crypto or a related field, or not. So why rank universities for our audience? For one reason, fair or not, universities are graduating the people who will be working in blockchain for years to come. Employers may find our research useful. For another, we measured whether schools offered graduate degrees and non-degree certificates, and included those details in each of our stories for the crypto curious who want to take their education further.  Finally, taking one of the most traditional institutions in the world for measuring professional success, the university, and measuring how it is adapting to teach and study a transformative emerging technology, is illuminating. For instance, the tiny nation of Singapore, which covers just 283 square miles (733 sq. km) and a 2021 population of 6 million people (similar to Johannesburg), had two of its universities in this year's top 10.  This result may be due to the city-state's crypto-friendly regulatory environment (though that stance may be undergoing a change). But it also may reveal something positive about blockchain generally.  ""Singapore is punching way above its weight on the global stage,"" said MIT researcher Reuben Youngblom, who advised CoinDesk on the methodology for these rankings. ""It's a fun commentary on what blockchain is capable of, being somewhat of an equalizer.""  ""At this point in these rankings, something like adding one class could add a significant bump,"" he said. ""Adding a degree program would have a huge impact. It speaks to how nascent this field is in education.""  Our rankings are an opportunity to take a step back from the unrelenting news and attention-grabbing events of this fast-moving industry to provide yet another lens for looking at the crypto universe as a whole, and taking stock.

The white paper, which is a document produced by the bank that can later be used to inform future laws, said the project was also looking into regulatory considerations associated with a CBDC.  The paper did not reveal a commitment from the RBA to issue a CBDC but the bank is seeking feedback from industry participants that will ""contribute to ongoing research."" The experiment is expected to end in the beginning of next year with results to be published in mid-2023, according to the document.  Australia's CBDC research project kicked off in July and the pilot commenced in August. The document was published in the wake of Australian opposition politician Andrew Bragg criticizing the current government, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, on its ""inaction"" when it came to crypto. The Albanese government has meanwhile announced it will use ""token mapping"" as a framework for regulation.

42422273,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0jUXh,1664190149,ECB Exploring Distributed Ledger Technology for Interbank Settlements: Panetta,"The European Central Bank (ECB) is looking at ""the potential"" of distributed ledger technology (DLT) in improving the efficiency of interbank settlements, said Fabio Panetta, a member of the executive board.  After listing the many benefits of DLT, Panetta also highlighted some drawbacks, and made a case for a system that builds on the ECB's existing infrastructure for wholesale settlements instead of building a new one based entirely on DLT.  A distributed ledger is a decentralized database that is maintained and updated independently by individual participants in a large network. Wholesale central bank digital currencies (CBDC), which are typically framed as a new type of DLT-based central bank digital currency that can be used exclusively for settling interbank transfers, have actually existed ""for decades"" according to Panetta.  ""But wholesale CBDC is not synonymous with DLT, as it can be based on any digital technology,"" Panetta, who is a vocal critic of crypto, said during a Monday speech. In the European Union, banks can already settle wholesale digital transactions using the ECB's own TARGET Services on a centralized ledger, he said.  Cryptocurrency markets reached a market capitalization of around $3 trillion in 2021, which prompted central banks around the world to consider how to keep up with the crypto world and the DLT technology that backs it. Around 100 countries around the world are exploring retail CBDCs, which are consumer and payments-focused digital currencies, while The Bahamas and then Nigeria became the first countries to issue them. The ECB is also in the middle of its own two-year investigation into a retail CBDC.  Read more: 9 Out of 10 Central Banks Exploring Digital Currency, BIS Says  However, wholesale CBDC experiments have been progressing faster – something Panetta attributes to the ""narrower set of stakeholders"" involved in interbank settlements compared to retail payments. France recently kicked off the second stage of a wholesale CBDC experiment while numerous monetary authorities around the world are working with the Bank for International Settlements (an association of central banks) on multiple wholesale CBDC experiments.  Panetta says DLT can enable the instant settlement of transactions in a wider range of assets around the clock ""with a broader spectrum of participants, potentially including non-financial corporations."" Although he said DLT could also be more secure than existing systems, Panetta outlined some drawbacks as well.  He pointed to the ongoing debate around the efficiency and scalability of the Bitcoin network powered by the proof-of-work consensus mechanism, and the environmental implications of the large amounts of energy needed to power the system. Bitcoin's distributed ledger is permissionless – meaning anyone can participate – which ""may still compare unfavorably"" to centralized infrastructures according to Panetta.  ""Importantly, the governance of major DLT technologies and networks is dominated by actors who are either unknown or based outside Europe, which raises concerns about strategic autonomy,"" Panetta added.  Despite these drawbacks, Panetta says the ECB must be prepared for a scenario where market players ""adopt DLT"" for wholesale payments as well as securities settlement. But a system that builds on the ECB's existing TARGET Services could be ""implemented more rapidly"" than a system ""based entirely"" on DLT, Panetta said.

42422280,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0jUjh,1664180265,Bank of America Says Cryptocurrencies Continue to Act as Risk Assets,"Digital assets continue to act as risk assets, falling as global interest rates rise, Bank of America (BAC) said in a research report Friday.  Still, positive signs of an eventual recovery include stablecoin inflows. Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold.  Last week these inflows jumped to $490 million, 58% higher than the previous week, the report said, as “real-world use cases like payments/remittances are adopted and real-world data providers like decentralized oracle networks increase functionality.”  The four largest stablecoins had exchange net inflows for the third week in a row, the report said, noting that large Binance USD (BUSD) inflows/USD coin (USDC) outflows could be the result of investors “preemptively rotating” into BUSD from USDC to avoid disruptions following Binance’s decision to auto convert some stablecoins into its own stablecoin.  Bank of America expects regulatory clarity to support decentralized finance adoption. DeFi is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain without the use of traditional intermediaries.  The jump in ether’s (ETH) price from mid-July to mid-August continues to reverse as investors digest that the Ethereum blockchain’s switch to proof-of-stake (PoS) does not fix scalability concerns or high fees, and these investors shift to a “wait-and-see approach regarding future upgrades,” the note said.  The transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to a more environmentally friendly proof-of-stake consensus mechanism is the first of five upgrades for the Ethereum blockchain, a process that was called the Merge.

42422274,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0jUVh,1664174429,File-Sharing Crypto Project Filecoin Reports Strong Fundamental Growth Ahead of FVM Launch,"Decentralized file sharing protocol Filecoin saw a nearly sevenfold growth of data suppliers since the start of 2022, ahead of plans for a major upgrade in early 2023.  At the FIL Singapore event on Monday, attended by CoinDesk, Colin Evran, co-lead at Filecoin development lab Protocol Labs, said the network’s storage providers were increasing at a rate of 20% each month, with most activity in North America, Korea and Hong Kong. Evran said that some 7,000 new developers were currently building applications on the Filecoin blockchain.  Filecoin (FIL) is a cryptocurrency that enables users to buy and sell computer storage on a system for decentralized storage of data and files. The latter is said to help support a truly decentralized ecosystem, where blockchain data itself is stored on networks such as Filecoin, instead of centralized providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).  Some crypto analysts have wondered aloud whether the growth is sustainable.  Protocol Labs founder Juan Benet said some 20,000 individual users were currently using Filecoin to store over 50 million data objects, all of which are used to run decentralized applications (dapps). A data object is a storage term that denotes a value or group of values that help any system to operate.  Such reported growth comes ahead of the launch of the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM), slated for an early 2023 release. FVM is a software platform, or “virtual computer,” that would be used by developers to create decentralized applications based on the Filecoin network.  Protocol Labs head of development Molly Mackinley said a testnet, or a testing blockchain that mimics real-world usage, was due for a November 28 launch. Mackinley added that prototypes for layer 2 – or individual blockchains that run atop the main blockchain – were already in initial testing phases and would allow for a more scalable Filecoin network after launch.

A Red Notice is a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender or similar legal action.  Kwon has yet to issue a statement via Twitter, but in prior tweets he has maintained that Terraform Labs is defending itself in multiple jurisdictions.  In response to a question on Twitter, Kwon tweeted on Monday that ""I’m writing code in my living room."" On Sept. 17, he tweeted that ""Unless we are friends, have plans to meet, or are involved in a GPS-based Web3 game you have no business knowing my GPS coordinates.""  It was thought that Kwon was in Singapore, where he maintains a residence, but police have confirmed that he's not there.  Prosecutors in South Korea have previously said that Kwon was ""obviously on the run"" and not cooperating with investigators.  Read more: First Mover Asia: Where in the World Is Do Kwon?

Bitcoin Sticks Near $19K as Most Cryptos Spend the Weekend in the Red  By James Rubin  With a couple of brief detours higher, bitcoin remained below $19,000 throughout the weekend.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $18,800, down slightly less than a percentage point over the past 24 hours. The decline capped a turbulent week of steep interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks and shrinking economic indicators that point increasingly toward recession.  ""Bitcoin remained under pressure due to the macro economic environment, and we maintain that below $20,000 remains a strong accumulation opportunity for mid- to long-term horizons,"" said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital.  Post-Merge ether spent a similarly dreary weekend almost entirely in the red. The second largest crypto in market value was recently changing hands at about $1,300, down more than a percentage point from the previous day, same time. ETH has been trading lower over the 10 days since the Merge, the technological shift of the Ethereum blockchain to a more energy efficient, proof-of-stake protocol. Other major cryptos were largely in the red with SOL and popular meme coin DOGE each down more than 2%.  The CoinDesk Market Index, which tracks the performance of 20 major cryptocurrencies, remained largely unchanged at approximately 940. The crypto Fear & Greed Index measuring investor sentiment has inched down again from fear to extreme fear territory.  Stocks  Crypto price decreases dovetailed with equity markets and other assets – riskier and more safe haven – that closed down during a dismal Friday. The tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500, which has a strong technology component, tumbled 1.8% and 1.7%, respectively. Those indexes have plunged five of the past six weeks amid ongoing investor fears about inflation and the economy. Cryptos have largely tracked stocks this year.  After chewing over the Federal Reserve's hawkish, 75 basis point rate increase and deteriorating housing numbers, markets will be scrutinizing U.S. durable goods orders for September, the U.S. Conference Board's latest consumer confidence index and August, new home sales. Economic observers widely expect durable goods orders to resemble last month's total, and a drop in new home sales. On Friday, the University of Michigan releases its next consumer sentiment index, which measures consumer attitudes about business conditions and personal finance, among other criteria.  Meanwhile, the dollar's recent surge has suggested that cryptocurrency prices are likely to continue languishing, although CoinDesk's Lawrence Lewitinn also noted in a Sunday column that cryptos, similar to equities, have been more nuanced in their response to events.  For example, in the seven days following the release earlier this month of a disappointing consumer price index, the CoinDesk Smart Contract Platform Index (SMT), which includes ETH, ADA and SOL, plunged almost 20%, while the CoinDesk Culture and Entertainment Index (CNE) – filled with non-fungible token (NFT)-related and metaverse coins like ApeCoin’s APE and The Sandbox’s SAND – slipped by “only” 6.9%. (Lewitinn noted that the Smart Contract Index's fall stemmed at least partly from ether's decline following the Merge.)  ""Crypto is still in its nascent stages compared to other asset classes,"" Lewitinn wrote. ""It has its own idiosyncrasies and prices move for reasons other than, say, dollar strength.""  He added: ""For traders, thinking about crypto in terms of segments means, among other things, coming up with more sophisticated ways to trade in a rising rate environment.  Despite bitcoin's fretful behavior last week, BitBull's DiPasquale noted optimistically that ""the $18,000 level has continued to provide decent support.""  ""If BTC doesn't break down in the coming days, we could see upward movement in October with $24K and $26K being initial levels to watch,"" he wrote.

Days after The Merge, one graphics card manufacturer took the coming glut of cards (which are already not that profitable to produce) to quit the business altogether.  Despite this, there are still proof-of-work tokens on the market. These aren’t exactly blue chip tokens on the front page of CoinGecko, but altcoins like BitcoinGold, Neoxa (which has a market cap of $4 million) or Cortex.  But the numbers aren’t going to work for miners looking to snap up some now-plentiful, used GPUs for mining. The best case scenario, using the GeForce GTX 1060, which goes on the second-hand market for $100, sees the card’s value being recovered in mined crypto in 35 months or almost three years.  And that’s based on a lot of assumptions. There’s not a rug pull with the token. The card doesn’t break down – a possibility with months of constant use – and the token’s value stays the same or increases (that’s asking a lot in the world of crypto).  Absent from these assumptions are power costs. Adding them to the calculation is beyond the scope of the tool from 2cryptocalc’s abilities.  But what if you wanted to mine a semi-useful token? For that, consider WhattoMine, which gives us the ability to calculate mining profitability based on hashrate and power cost.  Our trusty GeForce GTX 1060 has a hashrate of 23Mh/s for Etchash, the algorithm used for Ethereum Classic.  Run the numbers, and it's pretty grim. Using one card, and the average cost per kilowatt hour in the U.S. of $0.17, the card makes $1.80 in profit per month. Meaning that it won’t break even for 55.5 months, or 4.62 years.  If this was scaled a hundred-fold, where the hashrate was now 2300 Mh/s, 100 of these cards would generate $182.6 per month in profit.  Even with ASICs, specialized silicon that’s built for mining, the math isn’t much better unless you have extreme scale. Data now shows that the most profitable ASIC miner for retail miners, the Bitmain Antminer L7, generates $8 in profit per day as part of the Nicehash pool.  It’s more profitable to just own stocks of listed mining companies.
