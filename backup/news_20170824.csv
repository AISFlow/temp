42379823,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Kp5H,1503602310,"Bernanke, Berners-Lee to Headline Ripple's 'Sibos-Killer' Conference","Distributed ledger startup Ripple is stepping up its attempt to disrupt Swift, the infrastructure provider that today connects over 11,000 banks around the world.  On the same day, in the same city as Swift's flagship event Sibos, Ripple has announced it will host Swell, an event also aimed at bringing the world's financial leaders together to network and discuss trends and strategies.  But while similar attempts might fall short for some startups, what could set Ripple's event apart is its stakeholder buy-in. Keynoting the three-day conference in October is none other than the former chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, Ben Bernanke, and the inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee.  Taken together, the competing events represent an opportunity of sorts for attendees, many of whom could do business with Ripple and Swift, to cast a vote about their interest.  Ripple vice president of marketing Monica Long said Ripple still intends to be a sponsor of Sibos, and will continue to host a vendor booth there, but that the startup's aspirations were bigger than the vendor platform.  Long said:  ""Our vision for what we could do as an exhibitor exceeded what we could do on the floor at Sibos. The ideas that we had in mind around programming, you can’t accomplish that on a show floor in a booth.""  Prior to speaking at Swell, Bernanke was among blockchain's early supporters, writing in 2013 that the technology behind cryptocurrencies might hold ""long-term promise."" Likewise, Berners-Lee has long been rumored to be exploring the technology.  Other Swell speakers listed as confirmed include the CEO of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, the managing director of GE Capital's treasury operations, Kristen Michaud and the head of innovation at Banco Santander, Ed Metzger.  To be held in Toronto, Canada, Swell will take place from October 16 to October 18. While this year's Swell won't provide vendor-booth opportunities similar to Sibos, Long said that could change.  She concluded:  ""I don’t know what the future will hold for this.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple.

42379806,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Km7b,1503598514,Russian Deputy PM Says He Supports a State-Backed Cryptocurrency,"A senior Russian official has thrown his support behind a state-backed cryptocurrency.  In an interview with Russian broadcaster RBC, First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov said that he is in favor of a ""crypto-ruble"" – provided that certain measures are put in place on the security front.  ""This theme will develop,"" he said in translated statements. ""But it should develop in such a way that the national economy cannot be put under attack, but rather make it stronger.""  Shuvalov isn't the first Russian official to opine on the subject of a blockchain-based ruble. Indeed, the deputy chief of the Bank of Russia remarked in February that the implementation of a national cryptocurrency was ""only a question of time."" Skorobogatova stated that, after extended discussions within the central bank they were finally ready to move forward with initiative.  The Russian government is exploring blockchain on multiple fronts, including work by health officials to test possible methods that utilize the tech for exchanging patient information. And earlier this summer, President Vladimir Putin briefly met with ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin.  During the RBC interview, Shuvalov confirmed that the government is considering investing in cryptocurrency mining resources, a disclosure that comes after word emerged that an advisor to Russian President Vladimir Putin is putting together a bitcoin mine of his own.  The idea that Russia would potentially fund construction of cryptocurrency mining facilities is in itself notable, given that at one point, lawmakers in the country once debated harsh measures – including prison terms – to deter the creation and spread of so-called ""money surrogates"".  Still, movement on this front is in the earliest stages, according to Shuvalov.  ""But while this is a discussion, there are no concrete projects yet. In order to develop such centers, it is necessary to prepare appropriate legislation and its regulation,"" he told the broadcaster.

42379797,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KlsV,1503594955,Bitcoin Cash Returns to Profitability Amid Mining Adjustments,"The relationship between bitcoin and bitcoin cash continued to evolve today, with the two blockchain networks competing for miner interest and computing power.  At press time, the bitcoin cash blockchain has seen five downward difficulty adjustments after struggling to produce blocks yesterday.  Blocks 481,878 through 481,882 each pushed down the difficulty (the mechanism that regulates reward release) under the network's ""emergency difficulty adjustment rule."" When triggered, the mechanism adjusts difficulty down 20%, making it easier for miners to find blocks and claim rewards.  As a result, the difficulty adjustments succeeded in bringing the hash rate to about 10% of bitcoin's hash rate, which made bitcoin cash more profitable to mine – even with the extra fees that bitcoin offers from its increased user base.  Miners have responded, in turn, with those using mining pool platforms like BTC.Top, F2Pool and Antpool once again switching to mine bitcoin cash. At time of writing, blocks were being found every two minutes.  A coming difficulty adjustment is expected in about two days, at which point bitcoin cash should once again be much less profitable to mine than bitcoin.

42379794,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Klv1,1503590734,Canadian Regulators: 'Many' ICO Tokens Meet Securities Definition,"Securities regulators in Canada have released a wide-ranging statement on initial coin offerings or ICOs.  The staff notice  on ""Cryptocurrency Offerings"" from the Canada Securities Administrators (CSA) – an umbrella group composed of the country's regional and local securities watchdogs – provides the clearest indication yet as to how regulatory bodies plan to oversee the emerging funding model.  The release comes after regulators in Ontario published an advisory on ICOs in March, and just under a month after the US Securities and Exchange Commission stated that its rules may apply to some token sales.  The notice outlines the requirements for companies involved in the launch and management of ICOs, as well as the exchanges that later list those assets for trading. Perhaps most notably, it reveals that ""many"" of the digital tokens investigated by regulators in Canada fall under the definition of a security, thereby triggering a range of legal requirements.  As the notice states:  ""We have received numerous inquiries from fintech businesses and their legal counsel relating to ICOs/ITOs. With the offerings that we have reviewed to date, we have in many instances found that the coins/tokens in question constitute securities for the purposes of securities laws, including because they are investment contracts. In arriving at this conclusion, we have considered the relevant case law, which requires an assessment of the economic realities of a transaction and a purposive interpretation with the objective of investor protection in mind.""  This sentiment – that such tokens are more likely to fall under the definition of a security – is echoed elsewhere in the notice, where staffers point out that some ICO promoters have ""[taken] the position that the coins/tokens are not subject to securities laws.""  ""However, in many cases, when the totality of the offering or arrangement is considered, the coins/tokens should properly be considered securities,"" the CSA wrote. ""In assessing whether or not securities laws apply, we will consider substance over form.""  The notice, which is republished below, also includes guidance for firms looking to create cryptocurrency investment funds in Canada. It further invites firms that are interested in launching an ICO to consider signing up for a so-called regulatory sandbox, through which new financial products can be tested in a limited setting.  ""In order to avoid costly regulatory surprises, we encourage businesses with proposed cryptocurrency offerings to contact their local securities regulatory authority to discuss possible approaches to complying with securities laws,"" the notice states, adding:  ""We welcome digital innovation and we recognize that new fintech businesses may not fit neatly into the existing securities law framework.""

42379796,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KlxX,1503585330,SEC Suspends Trading of Publicly Listed Bitcoin Firm,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a temporary suspension on the shares of publicly traded bitcoin firm First Bitcoin Capital.  In a statement, the SEC said that the suspension, which began at 9:30 a.m. ET this morning, would last until at least 11:59am ET on September 7. First Bitcoin Capital's shares are traded over-the-counter, and prior to the suspension were trading at $1.79 apiece, according to data from Bloomberg.  The SEC said that it was moving to suspend trading because of concerns over the information published by First Bitcoin Capital, including the value of the assets it claims to possess.  The agency wrote in its suspension notice:  ""The Commission temporarily suspended trading in the securities of BITCF because of concerns regarding the accuracy and adequacy of publicly available information about the company including, among other things, the value of BITCF's assets and its capital structure. This order was entered pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Exchange Act.""  According to its website, the Canada-based firm operates a number of cryptocurrency-related business lines, including a bitcoin exchange and a network of ATMs. First Bitcoin Capital did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The move represents the second cryptocurrency-related suspension initiated by the SEC this month.  As CoinDesk previously reported, the agency issued a suspension on the shares of CIAO Group, an OTC-traded firm, over concerns about statements regarding an upcoming initial coin offering (ICO).

REX ETFs, founded in 2014, filed to create the ""REX Bitcoin Strategy Fund"" yesterday, according to a new submission with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Instead of investing directly in the cryptocurrency itself, the fund intends to buy bitcoin futures contracts and exchange-traded notes in a bid to create exposure to market.  The firm's initial prospectus states:  ""The fund does not expect to invest directly in bitcoin. Instead, the Fund will invest directly or indirectly in financial instruments that provide exposure to the price movements of bitcoin, including futures contracts linked to the price of bitcoin or an index thereof and that are traded and/or listed in the United States (""Bitcoin Futures"").""  Ahead of the filing, REX announced that it was creating a subsidiary dedicated to the development of investment products built around digital assets like bitcoin. In statements, representatives of the firm indicated that it would look to create multiple products in the years ahead.  ""We believe cryptocurrencies are a phenomenal innovation that will impact finance and investing for decades to come,"" REX CEO Greg King said.  The filing represents latest effort to capitalize on the growing momentum behind bitcoin derivatives.  Earlier this month, options exchange CBOE announced its plans to launch bitcoin derivatives. Further, CoinDesk also reported this month that US-based money manager VanEck is looking to launch its own bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).  At the same time, the SEC has displayed a degree of reticence when it comes to approving at least some bitcoin-tied investment products, as shown perhaps most notably in its rejection of an ETF proposed by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.  The SEC has since moved to review that decision, though it's unclear at this time whether the agency will ultimately approve it.

42379804,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Km03,1503579604,Manufacturing Giant Midea Wants to Put Bitcoin Miners in Household Appliances,"Midea Group, a major manufacturer of electrical appliances in China, is seeking to patent a method for mining bitcoin with household items, public records show.  The previously unreported application was submitted last November and published earlier this year by the State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) of the People's Republic of China.  The company's application calls for appliances ranging from air conditioners, dehumidifiers and TVs to be built with specialized mining chips embedded inside. Once programmed, the products would connect to a cloud-based service and contribute their hashing power in the background.  As the patent application's abstract explains:  ""The method comprises the following steps: controlling network access of the household appliance, and logging in a bitcoin account via the household appliance, wherein the bitcoin account is an account preregistered in a bitcoin [mining] website; driving a controller of the household appliance to [mine] coins in the bitcoin [mining] website, and storing the ... bitcoins into a bitcoin wallet corresponding to the bitcoin account.""  According to the method proposed by the patent, running the mining software would not impact the normal function of the device, and the system works even when the appliance is not in use. As a result, ""the service range and commercial value of the household appliance is increased,"" while also generating some extra income for the product owner.  The concept itself has been explored over the years, by companies such as bitcoin startup 21 Inc., nor is Midea the first firm in China to weigh the idea as well.  The viability of software patents in China is also a little unclear. Computer programs cannot be patented, but are eligible for some copyright protection. According to SIPO, software may be patentable if the combination of code and hardware constitutes something that is truly innovative.  Midea Group, which employs more than 125,000 people, was ranked 450 on the Fortune Global 500 list for 2017. In financial statements from earlier this year, the company reported more than $22 billion in revenue for FY2016 – with $2 billion in profits.

42379795,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KlrF,1503576005,Drivechain Developers Hold First Meeting on Future of Sidechains Project,"While other sidechain proposals seem to be running into hurdles, Drivechain is shifting into gear.  The disparate open-source developer group behind the project came together for the first time last week to organize and plan how it will evolve a proposal to upgrade the bitcoin blockchain with new technology that could increase its functionality.  And while it still requires an update at the protocol level, Drivechain has recently emerged as the favorite sidechain proposal among some bitcoin developers for its supposed ability to link multiple blockchains and offer a way to test new features – say, MimbleWimble for anonymous transactions – with real bitcoin, but before those features are integrated into bitcoin itself.  During the meeting last week, a few of the project's contributors, including Drivechain inventor Paul Sztorc, pseudonymous developer CryptAxe, Bitcoin Core contributor Chris Stewart and BitPay head of design Jason Dreyzehner, discussed the half a dozen documents Stewart and Sztorc have written, sketching out possible technical details of Drivechain.  While Sztorc, Stewart and other developers have already been contributing to the Drivechain project, they're now formally and publicly coming together to combine resources. Sztorc has published documentation about how the process might work, and Stewart has proposed a bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP) for the same.  Describing the meeting, Stewart told CoinDesk: ""We discussed the pros and cons of the various proposals.""  He further explained that there are two components that a sidechain implementation needs: 1) how sidechains will be mined in relation to the main chain, and 2) how money will be moved from the sidechain back to the bitcoin blockchain, when users want to do so.  And deciding how best to accomplish these technical elements is arguably the hardest part of getting any proposal to primetime.  But Drivechain's developers are determined, agreeing to meet each Wednesday from here on out, with any and all open-source developers invited to participate or listen in.  While this is potentially a step forward for the project, as it shows increased interest in formalizing the proposals, the results of these discussions are not necessarily set in stone. Further, since the meetings have been small so far, Drivechain's developers will also request feedback from the broader developer community.  And that's an important factor, as Drivechain remains a controversial idea, with some bitcoin developers indifferent about the technology, and others worried it could negatively impact the main bitcoin network.

42379802,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Km3p,1503572409,No SegWit Bump? Bitcoin Price Shrugs Off Upgrade with Sideways Trading,"""SegWit is old news for the market.""  So says crypto analyst Petar Zivkovski, and there's evidence to suggest traders largely agree. Despite just completing perhaps its most significant technical upgrade ever, the price of bitcoin is down just under 1% over the last 24 hours of trading.  To Zivkovski, this shows that bitcoin's upgrade, no matter how impactful, was for traders a classic ""buy the rumor"" event. He speculates much of the price activity in recent months was due to the upgrade – prior to it being clear SegWit would be activated (thereby increasing and redefining network capacity), he notes bitcoin was trading below $2,000.  But before the network adopts the top-level payment networks and other next-generation features enabled by SegWit, Zivkovski expects a run of profit-taking.  Others are less certain here. Arthur Hayes, CEO of bitcoin derivatives exchange BitMEX, said that while the price will likely decline slightly in coming days, he expects it to ""zoom higher"" in the aftermath of the activation.  ""My upside price target is $4,500 then $5,000,"" he told CoinDesk.  Elsewhere, comments hint that traders are just beginning to understand how cryptographic assets broadly respond to issues related to their technology. Charles Hayter, founder of exchange service CryptoCompare, for instance, chose to view it as the latest data point in an ongoing experiment on the matter.  Though he said it's likely to provide a ""positive catalyst"" long term, he hinted at an uncertain outlook in the coming days, remarking:  ""With litecoin we saw a fall after the enaction of SegWit, but with bitcoin cash we saw a price rise on 8MB blocks being mined – its half a dozen of one and half a dozen of the other for bitcoin.""  Eyeing future changes  Among analysts there was also a feeling that prices could be locked into the current range until November, when another technical change is anticipated for the network.  Given the controversy around the plan, and the possibility that it could result in the creation of a third major bitcoin asset, Hayes put forward this idea, arguing that while the price could creep above $5,000, it's not likely to go much higher.  Elsewhere, developer and trader Jacob Eliosoff agreed that uncertainty is likely ahead as the market looks to price in those coming changes.  ""I predict will be a huge mess and will do at least temporary damage to the price – around the split itself,"" he said.

42379789,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Kloj,1503568812,Finnish Police Launch OneCoin Investigation Amid Global Crackdown,"Police in Finland have launched an investigation into OneCoin, a digital currency scheme widely considered to be fraudulent.  Local reports  indicate that Finnish authorities are currently looking into the firm, with Antti Perälä, an official leading the investigation, stating that criminal reports against the operation are being filed by both private individuals and tax authorities.  The scheme – through which individuals are sold investment token ""packages"" which can then be redeemed for OneCoins in an online platform – has been on Finland's radar since 2015. One report indicated that as many as 20,000 citizens had invested ""tens of millions of euros"" in the scheme, per conservative estimates.  The case is ultimately expected to reach the prosecutorial level, suggesting that Finland's government may pursue court action against promoters in the country, as well as others involved with the scheme.  It's a strategy that mirrors one taking place in India, where police and national prosecutors have been building a case against OneCoin promotors. A number of individuals have been arrested in recent months in connection with that investigation.  And, in Italy, promoters of the scheme were fined almost €2.6 million in mid-August, after it was ruled that OneCoin was operating a pyramid scheme.  The Italian Antitrust Authority said at the time: ""OneCoin's dissemination took place through a pyramid sales system as recruitment of new consumers was the sole purpose of sales activity and was strongly encouraged by the recognition of various bonuses, the only real and effective remuneration of the program.""  Authorities in Germany, Italy and Vietnam, among others, have also moved to investigate or crack down on OneCoin since the start of the year.

42379792,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Klpz,1503565202,Segwit2x Developers Label Controversial Bitcoin Code 'Production Release',"The code for the controversial bitcoin scaling proposal Segwit2x is nearing completion.  At least, that's what BitGo CEO and project leader Mike Belshe has claimed in new a mailing list update.  Segwit2x, which aims to initiate a hard fork as part of a bid to increase capacity, has released several code iterations since it launched in May, but software version 1.14.5, the group says, may be close to what is ultimately released and is now being called the ""production release.""  ""The software is working as intended and there have been no bugs or faults,"" Belshe wrote.  Further evidence of the software's stability, he claimed, is that it survived through both BIP 91 and SegWit activations, two of bitcoin's biggest and most-watched upgrades in recent months.  The claims contrast with voices from some well-known developers in the space, who have argued that software has been created on a rushed timeline and without enough user and bitcoin developer support.  Still, Belshe added that some changes will be allowed. ""Only bug fixes and documentation changes that contribute to the success of the November upgrade will be included. Maximum stability and minimum changes are the goal,"" he wrote.  Perhaps the most-discussed possible change is the addition of so-called ""replay protection,"" which would help prevent users from possibly losing funds should the Segwit2x hard fork fail to convince most users to adopt its changes and abandon the current version of the bitcoin software.  In this light, Belshe went on to urge Segwit2x developers to keep tabs on the project, despite the hard fork not happening until November:  ""The Segwit2x project now enters its quiet period as we prepare for the November upgrade. Only software changes absolutely necessary to ensure a safe November upgrade should be considered as changes. During this time, it may seem like nothing is happening or that we don't need to persist. But we do.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which helped organize the Segwit2x agreement, and has an ownership stake in BitGo.

42379808,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KmA7,1503561614,Standpoint Founder: Bitcoin Asset Class Will Grow Into $2 Trillion Market,"Forget $5,000.  At a time when many are making short-term bets on the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, one bitcoin bull is going a step further. Ronnie Moas, founder of Standpoint Research, is making the case cryptocurrencies will not only be a decade-long trend, but a viable asset class.  In fact, he's going so far as to call for a massive rise in the market cap of cryptocurrencies. His prediction? The total value of all cryptographic assets, today valued at $150 billion, will soar to $2 trillion over the next 10 years.  And in a new interview, Moas walked CoinDesk through his forecast, explaining how it stems from his fundamental analysis of the capital markets and the broader macroeconomic trends he now sees in place.  The Standpoint founder's view stands in stark contrast to the highly bearish analysis of Peter Schiff, who called cryptocurrency a bubble, a speculative frenzy and a natural Ponzi scheme driven by ""just plain greed"" last week.  In the broadest sense, Moas sees the current state of the cryptocurrency market as a direct parallel to Silicon Valley during the 1990s, when a massive surge of innovation created new technologies that transformed the way we work and live and ushered in a period of massive wealth creation.  He explained:  ""I am not any more concerned with bitcoin being at a record high than Amazon or Google investors were concerned when those share prices jumped hundreds of percent and hit $100 and $200 many years ago. Today, both of those stocks are above $900. The question is not where we are at – it is where are we going? I do not think we are in a bubble.""  Roadmap to $2 trillion  How does Moas get to the $2 trillion market cap for cryptocurrency in his forecast?  He begins by looking at the $200 trillion that is currently invested in global capital markets today, including all major asset classes: cash, stocks, bonds and gold. Moas, who also does traditional equity analysis, begins his market breakdown with stocks, which he believes are currently overvalued.  According to Moas, three-quarters of the names in the S&P 500 are trading at least 18 times earnings, which is higher than his value threshold of 12 times earnings. He also adds that we haven't had a stock market correction in 20 months.  On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is currently losing 1 to 2 percent per year due to inflation. Moas also points out that the dollar has lost half its value since he was in high school 35 years ago.  From a global perspective, where most people don't have access to U.S. dollars, Moas believes the case for cryptocurrency is even more compelling:  ""Now, imagine what they think of their own local currencies elsewhere in the world. Imagine you live in Venezuela and you're keeping your money under the mattress. Would you rather leave it there in Venezuelan bolivar or would you rather put it in bitcoin? It's not going to take you very long to make that decision.""  Breaking his thesis down further, Moas believes that a conservative estimate is that at least 1 percent of the $200 trillion now tied up in stocks, cash, gold and bonds will migrate into cryptocurrencies over the next decade.  In that case, he says, ""Bitcoin could end up with a market capitalization that is more than Amazon and Apple combined.""  Under this scenario, that would mean that the current market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies would naturally grow.  And if Moas's market capitalization targets are correct, investors would then receive a 1,250 percent return on their cryptocurrency investments made today.  Diversified strategy  But he adds one major caveat to that prediction. Simply, ""You've got to be in the right names.""  Assuming you accept Moas's basic bull market thesis for cryptocurrencies, how do you know if you are invested in the right ""names"" in the cryptocurrency space? And, if the market boom in cryptocurrency is analogous to the roaring years of the 1990s tech boom, how can you avoid investing in the next Pets.com?  As Moas frames it:  ""A lot of people say there is a bubble out there. I see a bubble when you get down below the top 50 cryptocurrencies. There are more than 800 names right now. In my view, what happens outside the top 50 is irrelevant.""  Moas goes on to point out that 91 percent of the nearly $150 billion market cap is invested in the top 20 names and 70 percent is invested in bitcoin and ether alone.  He recommends, for the purposes of portfolio diversification, retail investors should hedge their bets and invest across the top 10 or 20 cryptocurrencies.  In Moas's view, the 800 cryptocurrencies that are now trading are analogous to the 800 stocks that were available on the Nasdaq at the height of the dot-com bubble nearly 20 years ago. While Amazon and Apple and Microsoft emerged to become among the most valuable companies of all time, there were many companies from that time period that died slow and painful deaths.  Or, as Moas more colorfully puts it: ""Back then, there were hundreds of pump-and-dump, small-cap junk names just as there are in crypto today. Today, the crypto market is giving you the same signals with names like dash, ripple, litecoin, monero, bitcoin, ethereum, neo, nem, iota and others.""  He went on to add that while there are certainly risks involved in investing in cryptocurrency, those risks are, in his view, outweighed by the possibility of 10-to-one or 20-to-one payout to the upside experienced by tech stocks.  The bull case  Of all the major cryptocurrencies, though, Moas seems especially bullish in his view of bitcoin. Unless there is a major shakeup in the underlying confidence, he believes that investors are going to want to buy-and-hold for their portfolios for 10 years or more.  Moas points out that there are currently only about 16 million bitcoins that have been issued of a possible total 21 million coins that will be created.  In his analysis, this could lead to tens of millions of people trying to get their hands on just a few million coins.  When asked for a specific price target, Moas summed up as follows:  ""At the beginning of July, bitcoin was trading at $2,500. I believe in the next three years you will probably see $15,000 to $20,000 for bitcoin. It could double twice from here in the next 36 months.""
