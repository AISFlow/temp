Blockchain technology has been touted by many in the community as a way to make the monetization of art and music fairer in the digital age by giving creators more ownership of their work, as well as by clarifying the licensing and metadata issues that cause music to be taken down from online platforms. Audius’ rapid expansion is a sign that artists and fans alike are increasingly finding value in blockchain-based streaming.

42407153,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAfExKH,1628196107,Market Wrap: Ethereum Hard Fork Rally Outperforms Bitcoin,"Ether, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was in the spotlight on Thursday as the latest hard fork upgrade, which wasa dubbed “London,” officially activated on the Ethereum blockchain network. The upgrade contributed to bullish price action as ether rose about 5% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 3% rise in bitcoin during the same period.      Despite ETH’s rally, some analysts expect widespread institutional adoption to take a few years. Institutional interest boosted bitcoin’s investment appeal over the past year, which contributed to a crypto rally during the fourth quarter of 2020.      “I think Ethereum might flip the bitcoin market cap in the long term, but not this year,” CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, said in an interview with WuBlockchain.      “I met Goldman Sachs, Fidelity and other big institutional asset management firms in Miami a few weeks ago and they said they're still struggling explaining what Ethereum/DeFi (decentralized finance) is to their bosses,” Ju said.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $41143, +2.83%  Ether (ETH) $2806.8, +4.11%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4429, +0.6%  Gold: $1814.2, +0.21%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.217%, compared with 1.16% on Wednesday.    Meanwhile, some institutions remain active across the crypto market either directly or indirectly. On July 22, Fidelity Investments acquired a 7.4% stake in crypto miner Marathon Digital Holdings for about $20 million.      On Thursday, French asset manager Melanion Capital won regulatory approval to launch an exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking the price of bitcoin and several crypto-related stocks.      Also on Thursday, Invesco, a U.S.-based asset manager, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list an ETF with indirect exposure to bitcoin via futures and other investment vehicles.      Large institutions are easing into the crypto market with a bitcoin-first approach. It will likely take some time, however, before investors fully embrace altcoins such as ether as regulatory hurdles must be cleared first.    Ethereum London hard fork    Ether was initially steady after the London hard fork was activated, but it started rallying about an hour later. As of press time, ether was changing hands at around $2,807, up from about $2,600 right before the changes took effect, CoinDesk 20 data shows.      Many crypto traders are focused on one component of the upgrade, called Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, which changes the network’s fee structure so that a certain amount of the cryptocurrency’s supply will be “burned,” or removed from circulation. The bet is that the blockchain’s net issuance of new units of the cryptocurrency will slow as a result of the change, ultimately helping to set a floor under the price.      Analysts at Stack Funds and elsewhere have compared the London hard fork and implementation of EIP 1559 to the Bitcoin blockchain’s “halvings” that occur every four years in the sense that major changes in the cryptocurrency’s supply growth are deployed at specific moments in the blockchain’s lifecycle. Some investors believe Bitcoin’s halving events in the past have helped to increase the price of the underlying cryptocurrency.      As of 15:06 UTC, some 585 ETH of fees had been burned, or roughly 43% of the block rewards issued since the Ethereum hard fork took effect at data block No. 12,965,000, according to the website ultrasound.money.    Ether technicals    Ether is now above the 100-day moving average for the first time since June. The price rally has cleared a significant technical hurdle, although the price could find some resistance at the $3,000 level.      ETH’s rally has outperformed bitcoin after a few months of consolidation. The ETH/BTC ratio is testing initial resistance at 0.06, but could see further upside as momentum improves.    Bitcoin seasonality    Similar to stocks, bitcoin is approaching a seasonally weak period, which could encourage buyers to take profits. The table below shows, on average, relatively weak returns in August over an eight-year period. September tends to be the worst month. Buying picks up in October and February.      Seasonal patterns can vary, especially as bitcoin departed from its historical trends when it tumbled in May.    Stablecoins as collateral    The margin assets for bitcoin futures trading has been shifting from bitcoin to stablecoins, according to Delphi Digital, a research company that focuses on digital assets. The shift has become especially significant as cash margined open interest soared after bitcoin’s price crashed in May.      “The most important implication of this is that longs don’t have the added boost of holding both spot BTC and BTC futures while it goes up, but they’re no longer exposed to deeper losses when their position turns against them (because their margin is in stablecoins, not BTC),” Delphi wrote. “For shorts, they can take advantage of downtrends without their margin value eroding, but they lack protection when BTC moves up.”    Altcoin roundup  TRU soared following TrustToken’s fundraising news: The price of TRU, the native token of TrustToken’s DeFi lending protocol TrueFi, rose 414% to $0.863. CoinDesk reported that TrustToken had raised $12.5 million in a new funding round led by BlockTower Capital, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and Sam Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research. TRU is trading at $0.65 as of press time. (Bankman-Fried is a billionaire, who also founded the FTX crypto exchange.)  HUSD reserves all held in cash: The reserves backing HUSD, the eighth-largest stablecoin by market cap, are all held in cash in money market accounts in the United States, the token’s issuer, Stable Universal, told CoinDesk. It’s the first time the issuer has released such information. (EideBailly, an accounting firm, publishes monthly attestations that the HUSD token is backed 1-to-1 with dollars, but has never provided a reserve composition.)

42407142,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAfEx8T,1628195096,Gensler’s Preference for Bitcoin Futures Products Is Likely Bad News for a Spot BTC ETF,"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler’s comments this week have some digital asset managers realizing that the excitement in the first half of the year for a true bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) may have been premature.      In remarks at the Aspen Security Forum on Tuesday, Gensler noted that he would be partial to ETFs based on bitcoin futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).      “I think his comments are pretty clear that a pure spot bitcoin ETF isn’t coming soon and that futures products would potentially be considered,” Steven McClurg, chief investment officer for Valkyrie, which has filed an application with the SEC for a bitcoin ETF. “I think it’s certainly going to direct our conversations and our product road map.”      While many in the crypto world suspected that Gensler would favor investment vehicles that include bitcoin futures, this is the first time that Gensler has confirmed his preference explicitly, said James Seyffart, ETF research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.      Some industry participants have said that this could lead to a spate of applications that include bitcoin futures. On Thursday, Atlanta-based asset manager Invesco applied for an ETF that would include exposure to futures, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Canadian bitcoin ETFs. (Grayscale is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk’s parent company.)      The benefit of prioritizing bitcoin futures over bitcoin spot ETFs is unclear, McClurg said.      “It’s a really bizarre world where you can launch a bitcoin ETF in Canada, U.S. people can buy it through their brokerages, and you can create a U.S. ETF that includes Canadian ETFs, but a bitcoin ETF isn’t available in the U.S.,” McClurg said.      Gensler may believe that an investment vehicle based on federally regulated bitcoin futures may offer more regulatory cushion than one based on bitcoin from spotexchanges that are regulated on a state-by-state basis, Seyffart noted.      “I don't really buy that, because ... there's a definitive relationship between spot bitcoin and the futures market, so no matter what you do here, there's going to be some overlap [in] related markets,” Seyffart said. “I think the biggest thing here is that it’s basically a delay.”      Bitcoin futures products would not only be more complex and costly to manage, but the market may not want them, Seyffart said.      Historically, institutions have flocked to closed-end funds such as GBTC over trading bitcoin futures on the CME, Seyffart said.      “Bitcoin futures are growing and they’re growing at a healthy clip, but they still don’t see anywhere near GBTC trading,” Seyffart said. “We’re talking about $25 billion in GBTC after a drawdown and trading at a discount.”      Aside from surveys showing that investors want a bitcoin ETF, MicroStrategy’s stock acting as a proxy for a bitcoin ETF is also evidence that the market wants an investment vehicle based on bitcoin’s spot price, Seyffart added. MicroStrategy is a software company that holds a large amount of bitcoin in its treasury.      Commodity futures also have the potential to trade with a negative premium, Valkyrie’s McClurg said.      “I would argue that [a futures ETF is] not as safe for retail investors given that futures don’t always accurately track what’s happening in the spot market,” McClurg said.      After Gensler’s comments this week, it’s likely that the SEC will continue to approve bitcoin futures mutual fund applications and then approve ETFs based on bitcoin futures, Seyffart said.      “The benefit of the mutual fund is that if they get out of control or the size gets too big or whatever happens, you can close a mutual fund, but you can’t close an ETF,” Seyffart said.      ETF provider Teucrium is the only issuer to have filed an application for an exchange-traded product (ETP) based solely on bitcoin futures, Seyffart added.But Teucrium has only filed its S-1 and has yet to kick off a review period at the SEC by filing a Form 19b-4.      The SEC has 240 days after an issuer files its 19b-4 to make a decision on an application. The first expiration of one of those regulatory windows is coming in November with VanEck’s 19b-4, and Seyffart said he expects the SEC to reject VanEck’s application and possibly other applications throughout the rest of the year and early 2022.      VanEck was one of the first issuers to file for a bitcoin futures ETP before bitcoin futures existed, and has filed for a bitcoin futures mutual fund, according to Gabor Gurbacs, director of digital-asset strategy at VanEck.      “Managing futures is expensive and the margin requirements are extremely high at an exchange level like the CME,” Gurbacs said. “You also have to roll the futures contracts every month which incurs costs and adds volatility.”      Gurbacs would not comment on VanEck’s future strategy, but said he expects to see more bitcoin futures-based ETF applications in the future despite the costs and complexity associated with futures.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/08/05/genslers-preference-for-bitcoin-futures-products-is-likely-bad-news-for-a-spot-btc-etf,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a28f86cee428f8887a652fce9a8b56468993b2ef-1500x1075.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407155,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAfExEN,1628188666,The Node: I Don’t Understand Bitcoin Maximalism,"I don’t understand bitcoin maximalism. I understand Bitcoin: the grace of its design, its founding myth and principles, the community’s dogged pursuit of a sound monetary system. I like Bitcoin and own a bit of the currency. But I don’t understand the insistence that it’s the only cryptocurrency project past, present or future worth supporting.      Bitcoin maximalism is a phrase often attributed to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin who – as a bitcoiner in 2014 – described the emerging belief that the only desirable outcome of this “quiet revolution” is a Bitcoin monopoly. All other coins are at best a distraction and at worst a wrench in the chain.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Then, as now, the phrase is a pejorative. It’s meant to evoke a certain closed-mindedness or lack of imagination in the Bitcoin community. Sometimes it suggests that “maxis” are only out to maximize their profits.      But it’s been embraced by the Bitcoin community, worn by those who are skeptical of anything “crypto” that is not BTC. At the recent Miami BTC conference, organizers hosted a “""Toxic Maximalism: A Feature, Not A Bug,” panel. I asked a number of self-described bitcoin maximalists to give their side in this ongoing war with those who seek to minimize Bitcoin’s importance.      In general, the best arguments break down into a few categories, including network effects (networks tend toward one), social impact (superfluous, silly or scammy “altcoins” denigrate Bitcoin’s reputation) and opinions about the historical circumstances of Bitcoin’s creation, adoption and purpose.      “Network protocols tend toward one, and Bitcoin won the race long ago,” Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, said in an email. Klippsten is a Bitcoiner’s bitcoiner, who is preparing and advocating for a world where the cryptocurrency is adopted as the global, base monetary standard. His service allows customers to buy and hold – but not sell – bitcoin.    Read more: It’s 2031. This Is the World That Crypto Created | Dan Jeffries    The history of technological adoption is often one of picking and choosing between standards, the theory goes. Consumers chose VHS over BetaMax, the World Wide Web over Xanadu, Facebook over MySpace. The same will be true of the choice between Bitcoin and the U.S. dollar.      I know what you’re thinking, didn’t MySpace outcompete other social networks only to become irrelevant? Isn’t Facebook also losing people’s attention? Does anyone besides the artist Sarah Zucker use VHS?      “The appropriate comparison for a global digital monetary protocol is another protocol we all use, the internet, not a company or an application,” Klippsten said. This was a point echoed by Till Musshoff, a bitcoin evangelist active on YouTube, who compared the cryptocurrency to the foundational TCP/IP protocol needed to communicate over the internet.      Bitcoin was the first system to solve the double-spend problem, which in effect was a solution to how to securely transmit value digitally. “You only need one protocol for value communication,” Musshoff said. “Every other implementation takes away resources from the main one.”      Apart from competing for resources, like developers or capital, bitcoin maximalists also believe other cryptocurrencies steal mindshare from the original coin or provide an excuse for governments to try to shut the whole crypto industry down.      Crypto, like the internet, is a place for scams and ridiculous projects. Many consumers lost money trading “dog tokens.” It’s difficult to grasp why jpegs could sell for millions of dollars. The word “token” conjures up images of carnivals. For hardcore bitcoiners, “crypto” is damaging to Bitcoin’s brand.      “​​Bitcoiners are deeply troubled by fraud and unreliability. We are creating and joining a system of unstoppable, unbreakable, honest money,” Klippsten said. It sounds self-serious, but he has a point about dishonest actors and unreliable code.      Trust is engendered in Bitcoin by its near-immaculate conception and history of development. Bitcoiners are wont to note that Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous founder, stepped away from the project without profiting from their work. Bitcoin was released into the world without anyone premining or a series of founders hanging around with money at stake.      “By contrast, we know the names of all of the founders of all major altcoin projects, who hold tremendous power over the participants in their projects,” Klippsten said. Even “well-intended” projects run into this problem.      All of these points can be argued. The idea that BTC is the TCP/IP for sending “value” is confronted by the general acceptance that bitcoin is more of a “store of value” than a currency. Bitcoin is just as often a means to speculate and gamble than something like DOGE. And is it fair to say that Buterin today has more influence on Ethereum than, say, Greg Maxwell, who suggested the Taproot upgrade, on Bitcoin?      The final point Klippsten made supersedes all of this: “Everything Bitcoin does should not be reinvented, and the things altcoins” claim to do could be attained by using a database. “The essence of the Bitcoin vs. ‘crypto’ debate"" amounts to a wholesale refutation of the entire crypto complex, he said      That means attempts to create an intermediary-free financial system like decentralized finance (DeFi) is redundant. That general purpose technologies like non-fungible tokens, which make digital goods besides money scarce, pointless. And a competing field of secure, freely tradable digital currencies moot.

As Eric Voskuil, one of the developers of Libbitcoin, the first implementation of Bitcoin, said: “Speculation on BTC has led maximalists to lose sight of the reason for Bitcoin. ... I don’t generally spend much energy on [the question of bitcoin maximalism], because it is moot. Other coins are here, there is no reason to conclude they are going away, and they are limitless substitutes for each other.”      Sometimes bitcoin maximalism is meant metaphorically rather than literally: It's a stand-in phrase for open-protocol money rather than literally about the Bitcoin network/asset.

42407140,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAfEx6V,1628188275,What Crypto Analysts Are Saying About the Ethereum Hard Fork,"Ether prices rose in digital-asset markets on Thursday after the Ethereum blockchain's ""London hard fork"" went live, and cryptocurrency analysts are now weighing in on the impact of the network upgrade.      At press time, ether was trading at $2,802. The world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is up more than $300 from its daily lows, with a 4.83% gain over the past 24 hours.      Martin Gaspar, research analyst at CrossTower:    The apparent success of the upgrade is getting priced in.  ""The notion of ethereum becoming a deflationary cryptocurrency in the future is now tangible, and the effects on ethereum’s valuation could be profound.""    Alex Svanevik, co-founder & CEO at Nansen:    It will take a while, possibly even weeks, to see any real impact from the upgrade.  Currently, he is focusing on a metric that looks at the percentage of EIP 1559 transactions, which is currently very low.  ""As wallets, bots, etc. start making use of the EIP 1559 features, we will know more about how this upgrade affects Ethereum long term.""    Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital:    ""Overall, the reaction is more or less as expected. It is very rarely that ethereum benefits from any immediate upside following such network upgrades, although a bias tends to materialize over time.""  These occasions are typically well documented heading into the event, given the transparent discussions on various forums and conferences, he said.  That's ""unlike, for example, the [Federal Reserve] meeting, where slight nuances with regards to language used may have a more pronounced impact on reaction by different asset classes,"" Vinokourov said.    Laurent Kssis, managing director of exchange-traded products at 21Shares AG:    Kssis sees a possibility of a short-term correction as the network stabilizes, before resuming an upward trend.  He said he can't see a definite trend in the short term, but a relative value trade could be implemented between ether and bitcoin.  ""With [non-fungible tokens] in full swing, we see a consolidation as demand remains strong in the [decentralized finance] segment.""    Alexandre Lores, analyst at Quantum Economics:    Increased scarcity of ether will bring longer-term value to supply/demand factors.  “Short term, this is another reason to be bullish,"" Lores said.  Lores also said that bitcoin is looking bullish on the 15-minute and one-hour candle charts.  “I believe this is anther supporting factor in the ETH rally; however, in this case it does not appear to be the dominant factor,” he said.  Normally, bitcoin is the main influencing factor, but in this instance it is merely adding fuel to the “bullish fire,"" according to Lores.    Tom Salter, digital asset analyst at ByteTree:    “This is the most extensive upgrade to Ethereum in years. Part of me thinks Ethereum maximalists did not expect it to be implemented. Clearly, hype has a part to play.”  “Bear in mind this rise has taken [ETH] to a 30-day relative high against BTC. That alone will give this breakaway legs.”  In terms of what is next, Salter hopes that several debates will be settled in the Ethereum community: whether EIP 1559 will give Ethereum a deflationary supply, and whether fee tips will be enough for ""greedy miners.""    Rick Bensignor, president of Bensignor Investment Strategies:    Bensignor attributes ether's rise in price after the London upgrade to a combination of the theoretical bullishness that comes from the ""hard fork"" (i.e., lower transaction costs along with slightly reduced supply).  He also said the uptick is because crypto traders tend to trade the news of the day, and ""it's not a developed enough market to really know what the long-term fundamentals truly are,” said Bensignor.

42407174,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAfExIJ,1628186146,Challenges of Dealing With Cryptocurrencies in Israel,"While Israel prides itself on a thriving high-tech industry and is home to many blockchain-related startups that export their goods and services, doing business locally with cryptocurrencies is an exercise in futility.      The difficulties began with a decision by the Israeli tax authorities in 2017 to define cryptocurrencies as ""assets."" That decision, which was designed to increase short-term tax revenue, has single-handedly killed any prospect of ever developing a viable cryptocurrency industry in the country.    Lior Yaffe is co-founder and director of Jelurida, and has 20+ years of experience in design, development and deployment of enterprise applications for large organizations. CoinDesk's Crypto State: Middle East virtual event is Aug. 11.    The “asset” definition – made all the more absurd by the widely used Hebrew term for cryptocurrency, “מטבע דיגיטלי,” meaning ""currency"" – also failed to provide any serious reporting guidelines. Businesses and private individuals dealing with crypto face an unpredictable tax exposure composed of a toxic mix of a capital gains tax (25%), income tax (up to 50%), value added tax (17%), corporate tax (23%), high revenue tax (3% on top) and who knows what else depending on the whims of the tax collectors.      According to the tax authorities, trading crypto to crypto using a bot on a decentralized exchange is considered a barter deal, like exchanging milk for eggs between farmers, and is taxed the same way. This implies some draconian reporting rules (that of course nobody ever follows) and an unknown tax exposure for years to come. Good luck trying to report cryptocurrency exchange transactions to your local tax office using forms designed in the 1980s. You did not report? You might be exposed to unspecified criminal charges.      Then there are the anti-money-laundering (AML) regulations that cast a wide net around anything related to crypto with very little risk management. Software companies and drug cartels alike are suspect until proven innocent. A dysfunctional government keeps hundreds of fintech companies in limbo for years by not approving their AML procedures.      Further muddying the waters, the Israeli banking sector monopoly strictly refuses to deal with cryptocurrencies or accept fiat funds from crypto exchanges. Some even refuse to accept salaries paid by foreign blockchain companies to their Israeli contractors. It seems like bankers, perhaps viewing crypto as a competition, enjoy making the lives of anyone dealing with crypto miserable.    Read more: What the Holy Land Reveals About Bitcoin    Considering our tax burdens, we might expect something from the state. But law enforcement entities provide very little security and support for cryptocurrency holders or the poor fellows who got scammed or suffered a ransom attack, or both. While Israel does have agencies dedicated to cybercrime, these agents are more concerned with fighting terrorism and seem to be ineffective with helping small businesses and individuals. Typically, if you're hacked, you will be directed to the local police station to file a complaint and never hear back.      In a country like Israel where democracy and civil rights are constantly under pressure, you would expect the media to understand the potential and power of blockchain technology and decentralization. Alas, most media mentions focus on cryptocurrency prices, scams and scandals, which this industry (unfortunately) provides on a daily basis.

42407137,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAfEx4X,1628185336,Why US Government Yanked BitGo’s Contract and Gave It to Anchorage,"BitGo’s hard-won deal to be the custodian of cryptocurrency seized by the U.S. government was a victim of the company’s own success.      The $4.5 million, six-year contract with the U.S. Marshals Service, which CoinDesk revealed in April, fell through late last week. Instead, Anchorage, a smaller competitor, secured an even larger USMS contract – $6.6 million – that expires after five years.      BitGo got disqualified on a technicality. USMS spokeswoman Lynzey Donahue told CoinDesk the firm was simply too big to win a small business contract, and so the Small Business Administration (SBA) nixed the original deal.      The turnabout is the latest development in a contract saga that stretches back to 2018, when the USMS first hinted it needed help storing criminal coins. A division of the U.S. Department of Justice, USMS is responsible for disposing of millions of dollars in crypto that its sister agencies have seized.      Fifteen companies pitched USMS beginning in June 2020, public records show. Some were excluded from consideration – the government says being too big for a small business contract is the most common reason – but BitGo and Anchorage both survived the cull. BitGo signed the contract on April 21. CoinDesk broke the news the next day, and BitGo trumpeted the victory the day after that.      That win began to teeter within five days when at least one of the contract’s 14 losers cried foul to the SBA.      “BitGo was their first choice and it was protested by competitors,” BitGo CEO Mike Belshe told CoinDesk.      Who that protester was remains a mystery, but it kicked off a bureaucratic review that caused BitGo to lose the contract and runner-up Anchorage to win it.      “We are unable to comment on BitGo, but Anchorage participated in more than a yearlong process, and in the end, we were chosen,” Anchorage said in a statement. It declined to comment on what happened behind the scenes.    Lucre and glory    The competitive world of federal contracting is awash in cash, private sector suitors and more than a hint of prestige. Especially in crypto, an industry with a robust criminal underworld, getting to boast of a law enforcement partner that perhaps counteracts the shadow is itself a prize.      Some crypto firms avoid that megaphone. For example, Chainalysis, the largest crypto tracing company, does not trumpet every million-dollar deal it receives from a government agency. It has secured more than 100 federal contracts from agencies such as the Drug Enforcement Administration, Immigration and Custom Enforcement, Internal Revenue Service and the FBI since 2015.      BitGo and Anchorage have each had only one record in the public databases – the same USMS custody deal. Both quickly marketed their contract wins.      “We see this as a validation” of BitGo’s service, one company exec crowed in the April press release. Three months later, Anchorage declared more or less the same.      Losing the contract will likely make little difference, financially speaking, for BitGo, which two weeks after declaring pre-emptive victory in April agreed to a $1.2 billion acquisition by financier Mike Novogratz’s crypto conglomerate, Galaxy Digital.      Galaxy’s certainly no small business, and few in the crypto world would consider pre-buyout BitGo or Anchorage, which holds a BitLicense from New York state that allows it to conduct digital asset business in the state, to be mom-and-pop shops either. But the SBA sets the line for small businesses in the “commodity contracts dealing” industry at those with less than $41.5 million in annual revenue.      SBA press officer Clements Tiffani told CoinDesk the agency checked a “snapshot” of BitGo’s financial records from May and June 2020 and found the firm’s revenue was too high for an SBA contract.      “BitGo has the option of appealing our determination, so far they haven’t,” she said in an email.      If BitGo had appealed, then a trove of documents detailing its size, salaries and revenue could be made public, according to Shane McCall, a partner at the law firm Koprince McCall Pottroff, which specializes in challenging SBA rulings.      Belshe, who will become Galaxy’s deputy CEO and a board member once the merger closes, said he’s decided to just walk away from this.      “We’re busy with the business,” he said.

It does not do crypto.      To make this clear, the company announced Thursday it is changing its New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) ticker symbol from “ETH” to “ETD” to avoid confusion with the cryptocurrency ether.      The Danbury, Conn.-based company’s stock soared earlier this year, which many analysts attributed to retail traders confusing its symbol with the identical abbreviation for ether, the native currency of the Ethereum network.      “We’ve definitely seen a massive increase on a percentage basis in mistaken activity on the Ethan Allen stream,” Rishi Khanna, CEO of Stocktwits, told the Wall Street Journal in May.      Clearly, the retailer had had enough. “This change will better differentiate Ethan Allen news from Ethereum news in search results, as Ethereum is often abbreviated as ETH,” CEO Farooq Kathwari said in the press release.      Farooq said the ""D"" in the new ticker symbol stands for “design.”      Ticker confusion is not unique to Ethan Allen. Similar confusion has been seen in the stock market as retail traders mistake unrelated companies for chat application Clubhouse or encrypted messaging application Signal. Researchers have been finding correlations between corporation name changes and internet-related “dotcom” names for decades.      In fact, Ethan Allen’s management could have perhaps been forgiven for going the other direction and trying to increase its association with the cryptocurrency. After all, while the furniture retailer’s stock price climbed nearly 80% since last August, the price of ether soared about 580% during the same time period.      The change to “ETD” will take place on Aug. 16, ending 28 years of “ETH” for Ethan Allen since the company’s initial public offering in 1993.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | TRADING,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/08/05/furniture-retailer-ethan-allen-tired-of-its-search-traffic-going-into-the-ether-changes-stock-ticker,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/657f7a82074e50520cc4e12f2622a60dbe3f8633-2560x2259.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407135,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAfEx2Z,1628182800,Chainlink Unveils Crypto ‘Keepers’ and Anti-Fraud Blockchain Bridges,"Chainlink, the market-leading provider of data feeds to blockchain-based smart contracts, is expanding its services to include decentralized off-chain computation – a job done by a network of node operators known as “Chainlink Keepers.”      Chainlink Labs is also standing up cross-blockchain bridges that come with an anti-fraud risk monitoring component.      Announced Thursday at Chainlink’s annual event, SmartCon, Keepers is a kind of service layer to tell smart contracts how and when to behave. The feature is now live on Ethereum and being adopted by Aave, Synthetix, PoolTogether, Barnbridge, Bancor and Alchemix.      The evolution of decentralized finance (DeFi) is a cross-pollination of on-chain logic in the form of smart contracts and real-world data that lives outside the blockchain.      Chainlink allows inputs – such as market data for DeFi, random number generators for gaming or sports scores for prediction markets – to be piped into blockchains via decentralized oracle networks that are maintained by a committee of Chainlink nodes.    Keeping time    The next step, as outlined in the Chainlink 2.0 white paper, is to offer computation as well as data inputs via the same decentralized network. To illustrate what is meant by computation in this context, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov picked the simplest use case.      “A smart contract can’t know what time it is,” Nazarov said in an interview. “It doesn't have a conception of time. So if you want a smart contract to settle at midnight on Tuesday, you need a Keeper.”      A common sort of computation used in DeFi applications would be the triggering of limit orders, or it could be more advanced things like the monitoring of certain debt pools for under-collateralized loans. What project teams currently do is build this computation layer in-house. But that’s antithetical to the whole decentralization narrative, said Nazarov.      “We’ve created an end-to-end decentralized application,” he said, adding:    “It has decentralization of the code and it has decentralization of all the systems controlling the code. Because if you arrive at partial decentralization of the code but not everything controlling the code, that’s where you can have flash loan attacks and all these other attacks.”    Chainlink keepers will be selected from the network’s existing pool of reliable node operators, said Nazarov, and the profit they earn will ensure they provide computation at any level of congestion or cost scenario. Going forward, more enterprise-grade keepers will be added to the network, like Deutsche Telekom’s T-Systems.    Missing links    Slightly further down the Chainlink roadmap, but something the team has been working on for the last two years, is the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). Chainlink also announced a Programmable Token Bridge that will be built atop the CCIP. The bridge can be used to send tokens and computational commands to any blockchain network, opening the door to more advanced cross-chain applications.      Crypto lender Celsius announced Thursday it has committed to using the CCIP.      The time is ripe for this, Nazarov said, pointing to last month’s high-profile THORChain exploit.      “When other people make cross-chain [bridges], they have two fundamental problems,” Nazarov said. “Either they haven’t designed a secure system, or they don’t have a relationship with the other blockchains that will result in adoption of the bridge.”      Under the hood, Chainlink’s CCIP leverages something like multi-signature security, Nazarov said, but done in a way that efficiently aggregates signatures from hundreds of reliable Chainlink nodes.      In addition, a new anti-fraud network will run parallel to the Chainlink cross-chain bridge, and monitor every single signature, transfer and addition or reduction of a node, Nazarov explained. The anti-fraud network has the ability to lock the bridge at any moment completely unilaterally, he added.      “This creates a critical layer of risk management and anti-fraud management,” Nazarov said, adding:    “If you look at any system out there in the world that moves value and transacts value, they all have anti-fraud, and anti-risk departments. They have huge investments in anti-fraud systems. But for some reason, we want to move around billions of dollars in all these bridges without a risk management system.

42407145,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAfExCP,1628182442,Sen. Portman Announces Support for Narrowed Crypto Tax Rule,"CORRECTION (Aug. 6, 2021, 21:55 UTC): Sen. Rob Portman said he supports clarifying the language in the bill, but did not explicitly support the Wyden/Toomey/Lummis amendment.      U.S. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), one of the leaders of a bipartisan negotiation team that drafted a $1 trillion infrastructure bill, said he supports clarifying the tax reporting requirements on crypto businesses.      The original provision, which sought to raise about $28 billion from the industry, would have enforced wider information reporting rules on crypto brokers and broadened the definition of brokers to any entity that provides digital asset transfer services. Industry participants worried that the provision would include miners, node operators/validators, software developers and hardware manufacturers, among others, rather than just trading platforms like exchanges or over-the-counter trading desks that actually provide the transfer services.      Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Pat Toomey (R-Penn.) proposed an amendment on Wednesday that would exempt the non-custodial business functions.      Portman – who previously defended the original provision and said it wouldn't affect companies like miners – tweeted his support for clarifying the language on Thursday, and called on the Senate to vote on the move.      However, the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), which projected the original $28 billion figure, reportedly said the amendment could knock about $5 billion off the actual amount of tax revenue generated.      It's unclear when the Senate might vote on the amendment. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) is looking to close up all amendments by Thursday and set up a vote on the actual bill by Saturday, Politico reported.      Should the Senate vote to advance the bill by next week, it would move to the House of Representatives for a vote this fall before. If the House passes the legislation, it would then be sent to President Biden's office to signed into law (or vetoed).

It's the first time the issuer has released such information. (EideBailly, an accounting firm, publishes monthly attestations that the HUSD token is backed 1-to-1 with dollars, but has never provided a reserve composition.) The disclosure comes at a time when an increasing number of stablecoin issuers have started revealing the breakdown of their reserves, as investors and regulators demand more transparency.      ""The reserves backing HUSD are currently backed 100% by cash held in money market accounts,"" the company said in an email. ""The current asset composition does not contain 'cash equivalents,'"" such as ""U.S. government Treasury bills, bank certificate of deposits, bankers' acceptances, corporate commercial paper, and other money market instruments.""      Money market accounts are deposit accounts at a bank or credit union that pay interest based on the market for short-term funds. They should not be confused with money market mutual funds, which are mutual funds that invests directly in debt securities such as U.S. Treasurys and commercial paper.      Stable Universal did not give a date for the breakdown.      In May, the largest stablecoin issuer, Tether, released a breakdown of its reserves for the first time, following a settlement with the New York Attorney General's office. Roughly half of Tether’s reserves were invested in commercial paper, the company said. To this day it has not identified any of the issuers.      In June, Circle, the issuer of the No. 2 stablecoin that plans to go public, revealed the assets backing USDC, after CEO Jeremy Allaire pledged to improve transparency. That disclosure said 13% of the stablecoin's collateral was invested in Yankee certificates of deposit (CDs issued by non-U.S. banks), 12% U.S. Treasuries and 9% in commercial paper; the remaining 61% was in ""cash and cash equivalents"" but that figure was not broken down further.      Paxos also revealed a breakdown of assets backing PAX and BUSD for the first time, with 96% in cash and cash equivalents and the remaining 4% backed by U.S. Treasury bills.      Though USDT and USDC still capture the largest market share, issuers of smaller stablecoins, such as BUSD, HUSD and GUSD, are releasing more information to bolster investor confidence.      “The HUSD stablecoin ensures that each HUSD is backed by 1 U.S. dollar, held in its safest form,"" Stable Universal said in the statement. It aims to ensure ""sufficient liquidity and guarantee for customers to redeem their stablecoin assets for fiat in real-time, regardless of market volatility,” according to the company.      “The plan is to hold these reserves in only cash, cash equivalents and short-term, low-risk financial instruments to ensure that the balance of assets held in reserve either meets or exceeds the volume of HUSD in circulation at all times,” said the statement.      Created in 2019, HUSD is a Huobi-branded stablecoin (though technically, the ""H"" in HUSD stands for ""hot"") created by Stable Universal, a British Virgin Islands company. On June 24, Stable Universal appointed Nevada-licensed retail trust company Huobi Trust as its custodian, replacing Paxos Trust, which was the custodian when the token launched.      HUSD has a market cap of $499.6 million and a 24-hour trading volume of $46 million as of Aug. 4, according to CoinGecko.",POSITIVE,USDT,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT,Frances Yue,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/05/huobi-branded-husd-reveals-breakdown-of-reserves-all-held-in-cash,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f3ec9849909c479e35edf5869f14ca05cb4536e4-1920x1278.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The supply-focused update could result in a the start of a spectacular show that could last another several months. A fractal has potentially appeared that mimics the price action just ahead of the most recent explosive Ether rally, which took the top altcoin by market cap from below $1,000 to more than $4,000 at the peak. And it all is happening as the London hard fork is implemented into the most important blockchain in the space. What Is EIP-1559 And Why Does It Matter? Today, Ethereum Improvement Protocol 1559 will be set live as part of the London hard fork. The upgrade will help to normalize ETH gas fees that during the peak NFT and DeFi boom of 2021, sent costs skyrocketing. Base fees will be algorithmically determined by the network, however, the user can also increase the fee to in essence &apos;tip&apos; a validator. To prevent validators from artificially flooding the network to keep fees high, validators don&apos;t get this base fee, instead it is burned. By destroying coins and taking them out of the circulating supply, investors believe this can further impact the ongoing &apos;supply shock&apos; or lack of ETH reserves on exchanges currently. In addition to this new EIP-1559 upgrade that could impact supply, it is part of a greater Ethereum 2.0 update.

Polygon's NFT-centric and gaming and metaverse hub Polygon Studios announced the integration on Thursday, stating it would help drive mainstream adoption of digital collectibles.  Users can now connect their Polygon wallet to Lazy.com, which also supports Ethereum-based NFTs.  Launched in March, Lazy.com is a digital art gallery designed to showcase NFTs as traditional art galleries work.  NFTs are all the rage this year, with sales volume surging to $2.5 billion in the first six months. That's a 180-fold increase from the sales figure of $13.7 million in the first half of 2020.  The trading volume of NFTs on Ethereum reached a record high of $171 million last week, up 338% from the equivalent week in the previous month.  ""NFTs still have their adoption hurdles, but none are as consequential as transaction fees and efficiency,"" Cuban said in the press release shared with CoinDesk. ""Polygon's structured and easy-to-use scaling solution obliterates these barriers. I'm excited to see how the NFT space develops from here.""  Polygon is a scaling solution facilitating faster and cheaper transactions by running sidechains or tangential networks alongside the main Ethereum blockchain. Scaling refers to increasing the throughput of the system, as measured by transactions per second.

42407133,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAfEu4a,1628169548,Ethereum Hard Fork Sends Price Jumping as Fees Start to Burn,"Ether's price popped in cryptocurrency markets after the underlying Ethereum blockchain underwent one of its biggest upgrades in the network's six-year history.      The upgrade, known as the London hard fork, took place on Thursday just after 12:30 coordinated universal time (8:30 a.m. ET), according to websites set up to track the blockchain.      Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value after bitcoin (BTC), was initially steady afterward but started rallying about an hour later. As of press time ether was changing hands around $2,780, up from about $2,600 right before the changes took effect, CoinDesk 20 data shows.      Crypto traders had been hotly anticipating the upgrade while monitoring the deployment for signs of how the changes might affect the pace of new issuance of ether by the blockchain – a key factor in determining the balance between supply and demand. Analysts had also noted the risk that something might go amiss as the new technology is implemented.      Ether staged an impressive rally in the weeks leading up to the London hard fork, breaking out of a two-month consolidation relative to bitcoin. The ether price has more than tripled this year, vastly outperforming bitcoin's 31% gain.      ""This adds to the already bullish trend and mood in the Ethereum community,” said Alexandre Lores, analyst at Quantum Economics.      Many crypto traders are focused on one component of the upgrade, called Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, which changes the network's fee structure so that a certain amount of the cryptocurrency's supply will be ""burned"" or removed from circulation. The bet is that the blockchain's net issuance of new units of the cryptocurrency will slow as a result of the change, ultimately helping to set a floor under the price.      Analysts at Stack Funds and elsewhere have compared the London hard fork and implementation of EIP 1559 to the Bitcoin blockchain's every-four-years ""halvings"" in the sense that major changes in the cryptocurrency's supply growth are deployed at specific moments in the blockchain's life-cycle. Some investors believe Bitcoin’s halving events in the past have helped to increase the price of the underlying cryptocurrency.      As of 15:06 UTC, some 585 ETH of fees had been burned, or roughly 43% of the block rewards issued since the Ethereum hard fork took effect at data block No. 12,965,000, according to the website ultrasound.money:      And as noted by Twitter user eric.eth, at least one data block mined after the hard fork resulted in more fees burnt (2.078 ETH) than new cryptocurrency issued (2 ETH):      But just as in prior Bitcoin halvings, it may take time before the full impact of Ethereum's London hard fork is known, so any resulting price in ether moves might be slow to materialize.      Once the upgrade takes effect, it will activate a mechanism to ""burn"" a portion of fees paid to miners. Although it might help to support the price of ether, this aspect of EIP 1559 is seen as controversial because of its potential to reduce Ethereum miners' revenue.      Until now, Ethereum's gas fee has been determined by a free market that operates freely. Users set aside a certain amount of ETH for their transaction to be processed and the highest priority goes to the highest bidder.      According to Compass Mining, miners will see their revenues dip by 20% to 30% after the upgrade because part of their fees will be burnt.    Big milestone    The Ethereum network has gone through a number of upgrades in the past, but this is arguably set to be one of the most significant in the network's history.      In 2016 the DAO Hard Fork took place, which was a major event in that it changed the face and community of Ethereum. The launch of the ETH 2.0 beacon chain in December 2020 was also a major event; although not a hard fork, it established the new version of Ethereum that would be using Proof of Stake (PoS).      In 2015 and 2019 the network underwent two slightly more obscure upgrades coined ""Constaninople"" and ""Ice Age.""      Ice Age in 2015 introduced the difficulty bomb, which refers to a mechanism built into Ethereum that increases the difficulty of mining over time. That difficulty bomb has been delayed repeatedly since then. In fact, one of the EIPs in London pushes the Ice Age to December 2021.      Constantinople in 2019 consisted of several proposals to make the blockchain more efficient and pave the way for a move to Proof-of-Stake in future Ethereum updates. There ended up being a serious bug in the code after this got executed and the developers had to release a second hard fork to patch the bug, delaying the upgrade.

Oracle service provider Chainlink said Swisscom is the second telecom company to enter DeFi. Deutsche Telekom, Germany’s largest phone company, is already one of the main data providers to Chainlink.  Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov told CoinDesk, Swisscom ""has very high security standards, which is important for being a high-quality node operator. But what is even more important is that you now have a trend of multiple enterprises beginning to see the value in running nodes.”  Headquartered in Ittigen near Bern, Swisscom is 51% owned by the Swiss government and has around 19,000 employees.  The Swiss firm’s digital asset division will head up the program and make sure the oracle node is continuously feeding digital asset price data into the Chainlink network.  Blockchain applications, or smart contracts, require off-chain data such as price data for financial contracts or information for an insurance policy. Oracle nodes continuously send data from the outside world into the Chainlink network, where it is then merged and made available in aggregated form for blockchain applications.  “We believe that making reliable off-chain data available on decentralized networks is a critical success factor for the future development of digital assets,” said Dominic Vincenz, fintech innovation manager at Swisscom’s digital business.

While small in dollar terms, the grant represents an investment in the further decentralization of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Other crypto startups, ranging from the lender Nexo to the Kraken exchange, have supported open-source software developers to strengthen the networks underpinning their businesses.      Block explorers are like special goggles, they let members of the public easily see what is happening on cryptocurrency networks without having to download and parse gigabytes of data. But they are typically hosted by centralized services like Blockchain.com or Etherscan, an arrangement that reintroduces the risk inherent in trusting third parties that Bitcoin was designed to avoid. To address that problem, mempool.space, a project run out of Japan, lets users run their own local versions of its block explorer.      Foundry said mempool.space is particularly appealing for miners because it shows the fees that senders have offered to pay for transactions awaiting confirmation and models what the next block may look like based on the mempool (a sort of waiting room for Bitcoin transactions).

42407124,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAfEtvj,1628166873,Ethereum's Hotly Anticipated 'London' Hard Fork Is Now Live,"At 12:34 UTC, at Block 12,965,000, Ethereum’s latest hard fork upgrade, dubbed “London,” officially activated on the network.      This latest backward-incompatible hard fork also marked the rollout of five new Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). EIPs 1559, 3554, 3529, 3198 and 3541 are code upgrades that aim to improve the Ethereum network’s user experience, value proposition and more.      It is fair to say that the London hard fork has received more media attention than previous upgrades. The growth of crypto markets this year has helped bring Ethereum to the forefront of the news, and investors are interested in the potential effect that the new EIPs could have on the network as a whole.    Ethereum's London hard fork EIPs, in brief  EIP 1559    In the words of CoinDesk’s Christine Kim, EIP 1559 replaces “Ethereum’s auction-style fee market with an algorithm that automatically sets the gas price.” According to a report from Kim, there are four significant purposes for the proposal, including counterbalancing ether’s increasing supply, preventing economic abstraction of ether, reducing fee volatility and increasing fee market efficiency.    Read more: EIP 1559: Ethereum’s Fee Market Upgrade Explained    All stakeholders of the Ethereum network will be affected by EIP 1559 to some degree. Users of the network will now have a new fee market that will change how their transactions are prioritized and will add predictability to transaction fees.      EIP 1559 will also introduce greater block size variance, meaning block sizes can fluctuate up to two times the current maximum limit during times of high network congestion. When it comes to the amount of transaction data able to fit in a block, this flexibility is intended to improve fee market efficiency and help alleviate some of the pain points caused by Ethereum’s limited transaction throughput, or how fast the network can process transactions.      Perhaps the most widely debated change that EIP 1559 implements is one that affects miner rewards. With the upgrade, miners will receive reduced transaction fees and become more reliant on block rewards, transaction tips and potentially ""maximal extractable value"" (MEV) for rewards.      Finally, long-term investors will see an update to ether’s emission schedule and enforcement of ether’s use case as a form of payment for block space.    And the others    EIP 3554 delays the “difficulty bomb” that is coded to make mining more difficult, essentially “freezing” it in preparation for Ethereum’s transition away from a proof of work model. Also called the “Ice Age,” the difficulty bomb is intended to disincentivize miners from using proof of work once Ethereum 2.0 is ready by making block rewards much harder to come by. EIP 3354 pushes the Ice Age back to Dec. 1, hinting that the merge with Ethereum 2.0 may happen at the end of the year. This is the fourth time that the difficulty bomb has been delayed, and unless the network is finally ready to move to proof of stake by the end of the year, it’s likely to be delayed once again in yet another network upgrade.      EIP 3529 reduces gas refunds, which were typically used to incentivize developers to reduce or delete unused smart contracts and addresses on Ethereum. However, “gas tokens” like Chi and GST2 gamed the system by taking up space on the network when gas fees were low and reaping the benefits by deleting their data when gas fees were high. With the implementation of EIP 3529, these tokens will become obsolete.      EIP 3198 allows users to return the base fee ""opcode,"" which makes it easier for developers to call and use any given block’s base fee for decentralized application estimations and efficiency.      EIP 3541 sets up future upgrades to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) by removing the ability to start new contracts with “0xEF or Executable Format.” Although it won't have an immediate effect on the network, it sets up future changes and restricts the EVM from consuming specific data types.    Things to keep an eye on  A potential chain split    The London hard fork is exciting, but it also comes with risks and ventures into uncharted territory. Backward incompatible upgrades depend on the many distributed computers, also called “nodes,” connected to the Ethereum network to upgrade their software at the same time. If a large share of nodes run by exchanges, miners and other network stakeholders don't upgrade, it may cause a chain split and disrupt block production on Ethereum.      While testing the London hard fork on the Ropsten testnet, a miner using the most popular Ethereum software client, Geth, approved a faulty transaction that led to a temporary chain-split. Ethereum developers and clients have worked together to ensure that a bug like that is not likely to occur again on the main network. To track the status of the Ethereum blockchain and identify chain splits in real-time, stakeholders can use node monitoring websites such as forkmon.    MEV and front-running    “Burning” the base transaction fee takes away revenue that once belonged to miners. In order to gain back the revenue lost, miners will have to rely on increased ether prices or extract greater value through MEV.    Read more: Valid Points: Yes, Front-Running Will Still Exist on Ethereum 2.0    MEV has caused users on decentralized exchanges to be ""front-run"" on trades, have transactions cancelled and face higher transaction fees because of frequent transaction reordering. Keep an eye on how the value of total MEV extracted on Ethereum is affected through the Flashbots Dashboard.    Fee market performance    Finally, it will also be important to watch how effective the new Ethereum fee market is in bringing predictability to transaction fee estimations and how much total ether supply is burnt through base fees. This can be tracked through websites such as Watch The Burn.

In a filing Thursday Invesco stressed that the ETF will not invest in bitcoin directly.  Instead, it will seek to have full exposure to bitcoin futures and at times may have exposure to other investment vehicles, including bitcoin ETFs listed outside the U.S. and investment trusts such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (Grayscale is a subsidiary of CoinDesk's parent company Digital Currency Group).  According to Invesco's filing, the fund is ""non-diversified,"" thus is not required to meet diversification requirements under the Investment Company Act of 1940.  SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has been vocal about regulation of the crypto industry in recent days, including the possibility of approving a crypto ETF, for which the agency has received well over a dozen applications.

Short-term buyers responded to oversold conditions on Wednesday but failed to push past $40,000 resistance.

42407131,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAfEu1d,1628161975,Bitcoin Again Falters at $40K as Ether Retreats From Two-Month High,"Bitcoin and ether erased Wednesday's gains as Ethereum's highly anticipated London hard fork, or backward-incompatible upgrade, neared.      Having faced rejection at $40,000 early Thursday, bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market value, is currently trading near $38,000. The 4% drop has nearly reversed Wednesday's rally from $37,500.      Ether is also down 4% near $2,600 at press time after it jumped 8% to $2,770 on Wednesday and hit its highest level since June 7, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      The London hard fork, which includes four Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP), is scheduled for implementation around 12:30 UTC, according to etherscan.io. One of the proposals, EIP 1559, will introduce a mechanism to burn a portion of fees paid to miners, thereby curbing ether's supply growth over time and bringing store-of-value appeal to the native token of Ethereum's blockchain.      Some analysts have cautioned that the upgrade's positive effect will be seen over time and that there may be little or no immediate price action.      Ether has gained nearly 60% in the two weeks leading up to the upgrade. As such, it looks prone to a ""sell-the-fact"" trade. ""Buy the rumor, sell the fact"" refers to a situation where some traders buy an asset in the run-up to a supposedly bullish event and sell after it occurs.      Technical charts, however, are painting a bullish picture. ""A new oversold upturn in the weekly stochastics [indicator] suggests ether can clear a 38.2% Fibonacci resistance level near $2724 for a target of a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level near $3356,"" Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, said in the weekly research note published on Monday.      As for bitcoin, Stockton expects consolidation for a while longer before extending the recent recovery rally from $30,000. Bitcoin jumped over 12% last week, its best weekly performance in three months. The momentum, however, has faltered this week, with prices falling to $37,500 on Wednesday.      ""We expect the pullback to mature in 1-2 weeks near the 50-day MA (~$34,800), after which bitcoin is likely to clear $42,600 for a revised upside target of a secondary Fibonacci retracement level near $51,000,"" Stockton noted, referring to the 50-day moving average.      The options market seems to agree with Stockton's bullish view. While last week's aggressive call buying has cooled, the demand for puts, or bearish bets, remains low. The put-call open interest ratio continues to slide, hinting at fading fears of a deeper price drop, as Delphi Digital noted in its daily analysis.      News flow continues to be positive, highlighting traditional investors' growing appetite for cryptocurrency. JPMorgan has started pitching a passive bitcoin fund to clients of its private bank, CoinDesk reported early today.      Bitcoin's immediate prospects will turn bleak if the 50-day moving average support at $34,800 is breached, according to technical patterns.

42407128,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAfEtyg,1628129197,JPMorgan Launches In-House Bitcoin Fund for Private Bank Clients,"JPMorgan Chase began pitching an in-house bitcoin fund to its Private Bank clients for the first time this week, completing its transformation from the ""never-bitcoin"" mega-bank to a participant in the digital assets market.      The passively managed fund doesn’t have any investments from clients yet, according to two people familiar with the matter. That could soon change because advisers were primed about the fund only yesterday in a call with the bank. JPMorgan declined to comment. The fund is being offered in partnership with NYDIG, which is the bitcoin arm of asset-management firm Stone Ridge.      The fund, which CoinDesk revealed in late April, will be presented to clients as the safest and cheapest bitcoin investment vehicle available on private markets, the sources said.      JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a bitcoin skeptic, once said he would fire any JPMorgan employee who traded bitcoin, according to the Australian Financial Review. But more recently he has said that clients want to invest in them and therefore JPMorgan has a responsibility to deliver crypto investments safely.      “I am not a bitcoin supporter, I don’t really care about bitcoin,” Dimon told the Wall Street Journal in May. “On the other hand, clients are interested and I don’t tell clients what to do.”      The private fund would also act as a port to a bitcoin exchange-traded fund if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ever approves a crypto ETF, a source said.      JPMorgan doesn't have a bitcoin ETF bid before the SEC, but almost a dozen other firms do, including Grayscale, which is widely expected to eventually convert its high-fee Grayscale Bitcoin Trust product to an ETF. Grayscale is owned by the Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.      NYDIG has also filed for a bitcoin ETF application, which the SEC is reviewing.      All of JPMorgan's wealth management clients recently gained the ability to access bitcoin funds such as GBTC through JPMorgan brokerage account, according to Business Insider. The new bitcoin fund, however, is limited to JPMorgan Private Bank customers.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/05/jpmorgan-launches-in-house-bitcoin-fund-for-private-bank-clients,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e447c3ac335dc4802352bab9bbc5043af6d28a2b-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
