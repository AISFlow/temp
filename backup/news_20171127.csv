42411665,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gldBWi,1511821353,Crying Wolf? Why You Can’t Ignore Crypto Scam Claims,"Marc Hochstein is the managing editor of CoinDesk and the former editor-in-chief of financial industry publication American Banker.  The following opinion piece originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.  As children, we all heard the story of the boy who cried wolf and learned that the moral was not to raise false alarms, or else no one will believe it when you report a real emergency.  But there's another, less obvious and more unsettling lesson of the fable. It's the takeaway for the recipients of a distress call (the villagers in the story): Even if someone pulled your leg in the past about a supposed clear and present danger, there is still the possibility he might be dead serious this time. So if you write him off because of his track record, there's a chance your sheep will be devoured.  This is a big problem for anyone trying to simply make sense of the crypto space, much less make money in it.  Everything's a scam  Bitcoiners, especially bitcoin maximalists, have a habit of calling anything they find a little dubious, or that they simply don't like, a ""scam.""  It's a serious charge – fraud is a crime, after all, punishable with jail time – but on Twitter and in crypto forums it gets thrown around like high school kids in the locker room calling each other dorks and losers. Though, to be fair, the ""S"" word is sometimes used in a way that's unmistakably playful.  In a footnote to his hilarious and thought-provoking 2014 essay ""Everyone's a Scammer,"" Michael Goldstein of the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute writes, ""'scammer' is a heuristic, not an accusation.""  If you believe bitcoin is going to the moon, as Goldstein does, then a merchant who accepts it is a scammer, even if her alpaca socks are as warm and cozy as advertised, and a HODLer seeking to buy it off you is a scammer too, even if the fiat he's offering in exchange is real.  A scam, in this broad definition, is any attempt to part you from your bitcoin.  Another way to think about this issue is that perhaps telling mom-and-pop investors ""all altcoins and ICOs are scams"" is the equivalent of telling kids that porcupines shoot their quills. It's not literally true, but if they believe it, they'll steer clear of a hazard and you'll have done a mitzvah.  In crypto, those hazards may include bad ideas pursued in earnest, good ideas poorly executed and outright scams. Some argue that the first two categories might as well be subsets of the third, for all practical purposes.  Risk of defamation  That's all well and good for the Wild West of crypto, but in civil society, the word ""scam"" implies an intent to deceive. Calling someone a scammer can damage that person's reputation (unless, of course, the charge is leveled so often, at so many people, that no one gives it much weight anymore). Without solid evidence, the label is potentially defamatory.  It's possible to raise doubts about an idea or business model, or a team's ability to execute on it, without jumping straight to fraud accusations. (Sometimes those lines of inquiry might eventually lead to the uncovering of fraud; one of the first articles poking holes in Enron's facade merely suggested that the company's business was overly complex and its stock overpriced, understatements in retrospect.)  But a four-letter insult is the easiest way to make oneself heard in the shouting match of online conversation, which I suspect is another reason why it gets used so casually.  Plus, if the CEO of the largest bank in the U.S. can call bitcoin a fraud, while his institution is building a private blockchain based on ethereum (a protocol that probably would never have existed without bitcoin), then why should anyone bother choosing their words carefully?  Wolves not far  Getting back to the villagers who ignored the shepherd boy, though, there are a lot of dodgy schemes in this space.  Just this month, a startup raised $374,000 through an initial coin offering on ethereum, then disappeared, according to Vice. There's a long list of stories like that.  Often the first people to question the operators are the same ones using histrionic language on other topics. Which means that you can't just shrug your shoulders and roll your eyes when the trolls cry ""scam."" Sometimes they're right.  Sorting the signal from the noise may be harder in this industry than almost anywhere else.

That's no small statement from Wences Casares, the man often credited with waking up Silicon Valley to the opportunity of cryptocurrency. Indeed, Casares' loss for words appears to be one shared by early adopters and long-time technology enthusiasts as the price of bitcoin approaches $10,000.  A milestone long trumpeted as inevitable by the bitcoin faithful, those surveyed by CoinDesk expressed a range of emotions on what it would mean if and when bitcoin tops the key psychological barrier.  Charlie Shrem, entrepreneur and bitcoin advocate, responded by calling the prospect ""amazing,"" while Zane Tackett, a veteran of the exchange sector called it simply ""insane."" Others sought to put meaning to the charts, suggesting that bitcoin's likely milestone signals a shift in the mainstream understanding of cryptocurrencies.  Jeremy Allaire, founder of bitcoin broker and blockchain payments startup Circle, for instance, sought to frame the price increase as an early signal for institutional investment in cryptocurrencies, a development he framed as beginning in earnest.  He told CoinDesk:  ""It certainly feels like we are seeing a decisive shift from the early adopter phase of digital currency into the mainstream phase.""  Others, like author and investor William Mougayar, called bitcoin's growth ""expected"" given its positioning as an ""entry point"" into the world of cryptocurrencies for many investors, though he said interest is likely to spread into an increasingly diverse market.  ""Bitcoin has had an incredible momentum that is both psychological and technical. This might be the tipping point for mainstream adoption,"" he said.  Though most of those queried by CoinDesk suggested that they see the rising price as positive, there was also a sense – notable among experts – that the market is moving into a phase destined to buck predictions.  Thomas France, a multi-year veteran of the industry and co-founder of the Ledger wallet, didn't even go so far as to call himself a market expert in remarks, emphasizing that whatever might be said about the cryptocurrency, the numerical evidence is perhaps enough.  ""I see the global market cap of crypto as very, very small compared to its true potential,"" France said.  Too much too soon?  Still, less common were those who sought to suggest that the surging price of bitcoin, up nearly 900 percent on the year, may trigger increasing scrutiny on its markets and practices.  Guy Corem, a long-time bitcoin mining company CEO and the founder of a new alternative cryptocurrency startup, DAGLabs, couldn't quite shake his bad feelings about the market even with the $10,000 level in the offing.  While he acknowledged his excitement, and what he called the ""clear demand"" of new buyers seeking to allocate capital, Corem worried about possible reactions.  ""I am just worried that the rate of growth is too fast and may trigger government's response,"" he added.  In particular, he hinted at fears that cryptocurrency exchanges could be cut off from access to U.S. dollars, or other major fiat currencies that currently provide the avenue for onboarding to new users.  Micky Malka, a veteran investor in the sector and former board member of the non-profit Bitcoin Foundation, also struck a subdued tone, calling $10,000 largely a ""symbolic number"" – though one he said has arrived faster than his expectations.  ""[I'm] already surprised with the speed, especially knowing that it's still not ready for every person in the world to access it,"" he said.  Too early to count?  That said, more active traders were perhaps less convinced $10,000 will be a benchmark exceeded with any degree of ease, owing to the fact it has loomed so large in the sector's psyche.  Arthur Hayes  , founder of bitcoin derivatives platform BitMEX, said he believes that the price barrier is likely to be significant for traders because of this, and thus, is not one that will be breached lightly.  ""I don’t expect it to be convincingly taken on the first attempt. That being said, I do believe that by year-end, it will fall,"" he said.  BTC VIX, organizer of the bitcoin trading forum Whale Club, expressed his belief that the market is in ""bubble times,"" and hinted that he is looking to assess the next assets traders may identify in order to increase gains in the market.  Others, however, appeared content to let the market evolve come what may.  When asked if a push above $10,000 was likely, trader Tuur Demeester responded succinctly:  ""I wouldn’t bet against it.""

15989470,http://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/how-is-a-bitcoin-made,1511809206,How is a Bitcoin made?,"So far in this series, we've already talked about what Bitcoin is, about how you can buy it, and how you can spend it, but how is it actually made? Bitcoin vs. Gold The short answer is that new Bitcoins are mined. However, since that is just giving a label, rather than a definition, you’re probably going to want to know a bit more than that. It’s perhaps easiest to compare Bitcoin to its nearest physical equivalent: gold. Just as existent banking systems are (or at least were) based on the quantity and value of gold in a given country’s banks, the security and validity of Bitcoin based on the quantity of Bitcoins currently available in the network. Likewise, the production of new amounts of both gold and Bitcoin meet the same paradox. As mining equipment becomes more and more powerful, so the amount of material to be mined becomes less and less, meaning that more effort is being pumped in to get the same net returns. However, this leads to a predictable and sustainable growth of the amount of either resource in the real world. Of course, in the case of gold, this is just how it worked out. Gold is an element, and therefore cannot be produced or created out of something else, no matter what any budding alchemist might tell you. Recent estimates hold the total amount of mined gold in the world to be somewhere in the region of 187,000 tonnes, with a further 3,000 to 4,000 tonnes being produced as a result of mining every year. As it becomes ever more scarce, new mining techniques and equipment must be discovered and invented in order to maintain that level of production. Bitcoin follows the same pattern, and deliberately so. Being a cryptocurrency, creating new Bitcoins could have been as easy as pressing the hash key on your laptop, but that would have been pointless: a free, abundant, and infinite supply of any commodity leads to devaluation and hyperinflation, and your billions and billions of Bitcoins would be worth less than the laptop that allowed you to make them. As with gold, scarcity and reliability are the cornerstones of Bitcoin. In a white paper that he published in 2008, Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto stated that the availability of Bitcoins would be capped at 21 million. By best estimates, almost 17 million of those Bitcoins have been created (or mined) as of 2017. But what of the mining itself? We can picture the notion of mining for gold – massive drills and diggers clawing out a mountainside to release the gold ore within, and so on – but what are we actually mining for when it comes to a pseudo-currency? To understand that, we need to talk about transactions, blocks, and blockchains. Transactions A transaction is any activity involving Bitcoins. If you buy a Bitcoin from a vendor, then that is a transaction. If you sell a Bitcoin to a buyer, then that is a transaction. If you purchase goods or services with a Bitcoin, then that is also a transaction. Think of each of them as being a line in a physical ledger, denoting money in and money out. Blocks If a transaction is a line in a ledger book, then a block is a page in the same book, essentially a collection of transactions. In real terms, a block is 1 megabyte (Mb) worth of transactions on the Bitcoin network. As each block (or page) is completed, the next transaction to be undertaken will fall into the next available block. A block is a permanent record of transactions on the Bitcoin network, and one that cannot be erased, removed or amended. Blockchain Again, if a transaction is a line in the ledger and if a block is a page in a ledger, then the blockchain is the ledger itself. Every ‘page’ filled in is a new block, or a new link on the chain. This blockchain stretches all the way back to the beginning of the Bitcoin revolution and the Genesis block that Satoshi Nakamoto released in 2008. If you purchase a Bitcoin from a vendor, then it is entirely possible, given enough time and patience, to trace the life of that Bitcoin all the way back along the blockchain, working your way through blocks (or pages, to return to our ledger analogy), all the way to the point where your Bitcoin was first created, or mined. Which leads us back to our original question: how is a Bitcoin made, and what is Bitcoin mining? Mining First of all, it’s important to realise that mining is just a piece of Bitcoin terminology. What Bitcoin miners are actually doing is auditing and verifying transactions on the network, specifically preventing a thing called double-spending, whereby someone could create an electronic copy of a Bitcoin, and spend it twice. Because every single Bitcoin transaction is held somewhere along the blockchain, the blockchain itself becomes the verification of legitimacy. If a transaction has made it into a block, and that block has made it on to the chain, then the sale or purchase in question was, by definition, a legitimate one. So, in order to maintain that legitimacy, every single transaction must be checked, in detail and in depth, to confirm the provenance of the bitcoins being used in the transaction, which is where the miners come in. The miners perform two tasks – the first is for the good of the network, and it is the verification of Bitcoin transactions. Once they have verified enough transactions to fill up a block (that is, 1Mb of transactions, you’ll remember, which could potentially equate to hundreds or even thousands of lines in our virtual ledger), they will be eligible to win a crop of newly-generated bitcoins. This, then, is the second task. The Bitcoins are generated by the networks own protocols, and are essentially up for grabs. At the moment, each new block allows the miner the opportunity to go for those bitcoins (currently 12.5 bitcoins are being generated, or mined, for each new block), and this is where the competition steps up. You see, verifying a block’s worth of transactions is pretty easy stuff. The next stage, to win the bitcoins themselves, only happens if you’re the first miner who happens to arrive at the correct answer to a specific numerical problem. In the Bitcoin network, this principle is referred to as proof of work. Proof of work You’ll be glad to know that there is no need to have experience with advanced computation skills or mathematics in order to provide your proof of work, as it is all done by your mining software. What that software is attempting to do is to generate what is known as a hash. A hash is a hexadecimal number that is 64-digits long, with each digit being one of sixteen designations (hence the word hexadecimal, from the Greek hexa meaning six, and “deca”, meaning ten: six plus ten). For Bitcoin purposes, the sixteen possible designations are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, a, b , c, d, e, and f. Now, the Bitcoin network produces a target hash, completely at random, with no formula for calculation, and no way of predicting it based on previous hashes – rather like a National Lottery Draw, for instance. Every hash is unique, and prior hashes have no bearing on the future. When a miner manages to complete a box of transaction audits, then they are allowed to have a guess at the value of the target hash, by producing their own hash. If the miner’s hash is equal to or lower than the target hash, and that miner is the first one to do so, then 12.5 Bitcoins will be generated (or minted if you want to think in terms of regular currency) and added to the existing pool of Bitcoins available for all. More specifically, those 12.5 Bitcoins are awarded to the miner who guessed the hash correctly. Now, if that all sounds a bit too easy, it almost certainly is. The odds of a lone miner making any serious cash out of mining for Bitcoins are stratospheric. Indeed, the odds of anyone hash producing a result that is under the target hash is less than 1 in a trillion. What allows Bitcoins to continue to be generated, and at such a rate (the average clearance time for a block is 10 minutes, with 12.5 Bitcoins being generated each time to account for same) is that there are loads of Bitcoin miners out there, using very sophisticated equipment and, perhaps more importantly, thousands of linked computers to do the computational work for them. There is dedicated mining hardware and software out there, capable of producing billions of hashes per second, spread over thousands of computers and, even then, there is no guarantee of success. Your newly-generated hash, even if it does meet the criteria, simply might not get there in time. Some other miner, or mining syndicate might have snagged that same hash mere seconds before you but, in the world of Bitcoin mining, the winners get the spoils. Lottery As mentioned above, the odds of a single user just happening to come across the right hexadecimal code in time to cash in are pretty unlikely and yet, with all those Bitcoins being spawned at the rate of 75 bitcoins per hour, and up for grabs, someone has to win it, and it could be a solo user. Think of bitcoin mining as a lottery because, quite literally, that’s what it is. While Bitcoin as a currency is one of the strongest and the most stable, getting your hands on those newly-minted bitcoins is going to take more than a little luck. First, there is your work for the network – that is, your verification of previous transactions, or lines in the ledger, to return to a previous analogy. 1Mb of transactions means that you’ve filled a block and that is essentially your lottery ticket, your eligibility to partake in a spot of hashing. Each hash attempt is a line of numbers on your ticket, and each line has a chance of winning the jackpot, so long as the numbers fit into a certain hexadecimal pattern. The good news is that you can submit your hashes as many times as you like, thousands and millions, and billions of times per second, which sounds great, except you probably still won’t hit the magic number, as every single newly generated hash retains the same odds of over a trillion to one. Again, just like the lottery, many people think of joining a syndicate. The rationale here is the same. One person, even one person with a decent mining set-up stands an infinitesimal chance of matching a hash. Two people combining hashes stand a slightly better chance, a couple of dozen even better, and a few thousand? Well, you get the idea. More people combining their blocks results in more hash attempts made over a given period of time, and a greater chance of getting the desired result. Of course, whenever you do win, you’ll make less, having to share your Bitcoins, or the value thereof with all of your fellow syndicate makers. You may also owe an additional fee to the syndicate organiser, who will normally take a percentage or two of any earnings, on the grounds that he is ensuring the legality of the exchange, and corralling all of the mining efforts of any given syndicate. However, it is a path worth pursuing. With Bitcoin currently valued at around $5,000 per bitcoin, and 12.5 of them available (or $62,500) every 10 minutes a sufficiently large and well-equipped mining syndicate can see decent profits as more people jump on board, prompting more transactions, blocks filled up quicker, and a swifter generation of more Bitcoins into the cybereconomy.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MINING | WALLET,,0,0,Crypto Daily,http://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/how-is-a-bitcoin-made,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/15989470.jpeg
15990434,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/how-is-a-bitcoin-made,1511809206,How is a Bitcoin made?,"So far in this series, we've already talked about what Bitcoin is, about how you can buy it, and how you can spend it, but how is it actually made? Bitcoin vs. Gold The short answer is that new Bitcoins are mined. However, since that is just giving a label, rather than a definition, you’re probably going to want to know a bit more than that. It’s perhaps easiest to compare Bitcoin to its nearest physical equivalent: gold. Just as existent banking systems are (or at least were) based on the quantity and value of gold in a given country’s banks, the security and validity of Bitcoin based on the quantity of Bitcoins currently available in the network. Likewise, the production of new amounts of both gold and Bitcoin meet the same paradox. As mining equipment becomes more and more powerful, so the amount of material to be mined becomes less and less, meaning that more effort is being pumped in to get the same net returns. However, this leads to a predictable and sustainable growth of the amount of either resource in the real world. Of course, in the case of gold, this is just how it worked out. Gold is an element, and therefore cannot be produced or created out of something else, no matter what any budding alchemist might tell you. Recent estimates hold the total amount of mined gold in the world to be somewhere in the region of 187,000 tonnes, with a further 3,000 to 4,000 tonnes being produced as a result of mining every year. As it becomes ever more scarce, new mining techniques and equipment must be discovered and invented in order to maintain that level of production. Bitcoin follows the same pattern, and deliberately so. Being a cryptocurrency, creating new Bitcoins could have been as easy as pressing the hash key on your laptop, but that would have been pointless: a free, abundant, and infinite supply of any commodity leads to devaluation and hyperinflation, and your billions and billions of Bitcoins would be worth less than the laptop that allowed you to make them. As with gold, scarcity and reliability are the cornerstones of Bitcoin. In a white paper that he published in 2008, Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto stated that the availability of Bitcoins would be capped at 21 million. By best estimates, almost 17 million of those Bitcoins have been created (or mined) as of 2017. But what of the mining itself? We can picture the notion of mining for gold – massive drills and diggers clawing out a mountainside to release the gold ore within, and so on – but what are we actually mining for when it comes to a pseudo-currency? To understand that, we need to talk about transactions, blocks, and blockchains. Transactions A transaction is any activity involving Bitcoins. If you buy a Bitcoin from a vendor, then that is a transaction. If you sell a Bitcoin to a buyer, then that is a transaction. If you purchase goods or services with a Bitcoin, then that is also a transaction. Think of each of them as being a line in a physical ledger, denoting money in and money out. Blocks If a transaction is a line in a ledger book, then a block is a page in the same book, essentially a collection of transactions. In real terms, a block is 1 megabyte (Mb) worth of transactions on the Bitcoin network. As each block (or page) is completed, the next transaction to be undertaken will fall into the next available block. A block is a permanent record of transactions on the Bitcoin network, and one that cannot be erased, removed or amended. Blockchain Again, if a transaction is a line in the ledger and if a block is a page in a ledger, then the blockchain is the ledger itself. Every ‘page’ filled in is a new block, or a new link on the chain. This blockchain stretches all the way back to the beginning of the Bitcoin revolution and the Genesis block that Satoshi Nakamoto released in 2008. If you purchase a Bitcoin from a vendor, then it is entirely possible, given enough time and patience, to trace the life of that Bitcoin all the way back along the blockchain, working your way through blocks (or pages, to return to our ledger analogy), all the way to the point where your Bitcoin was first created, or mined.

Speaking with CNBC today, Nuveen's Bob Doll made the remark, becoming the latest traditional finance analyst to point to the speculation in the market. Doll's comments were driven by bitcoin's surge to a new all-time high, following its jump above $9,000 this weekend.  Speculative aspects aside, Doll added that ""it's been an amazing run"" for bitcoin.  He told the network:  ""I confess it's an area of that to me feels speculative, but you might call me old or old-fashioned. It's been an amazing run, has it not?""  Doll also indicated that the cryptocurrency price ramp has gotten some quarters of the finance world talking, though what that interest will lead to remains to be seen.  ""'With bitcoin, why do you need the stock market?' has been the saying of late,"" Doll quipped.  Doll isn't the first from Nuveen – which was founded in 1898 and boasts roughly $948 billion in assets under management – to comment on cryptocurrency markets.  In October, Nuveen announced plans to put some of its less liquid assets onto exchange-traded funds. According to Bloomberg, the firm remarked at the time that bitcoin's rise indicated an interest in new ways to transact currencies.  The firm also suggested that it sees blockchain providing ""some real usefulness and potential in the market,"" though it cautioned that any potential applications of the tech in the finance space remain in development.

42400694,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKQWZ,1511797544,Short-Lived Shine? Bitcoin Gold Could Fall Under $300,"Bitcoin gold (BTG) may have leapt up in the token rankings, but its gleam may soon dull, the price charts indicate.  Notably, the new cryptocurrency, a bitcoin spinoff with a protocol designed to make mining more democratic, has now become the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  Yet, despite a rally to a high of $413.74 on Nov. 24, and a doubling of prices since Nov. 19, BTG faces plenty of skepticism in the investor community over its real-world role. Comments on social media indicate the investors feel the token is overvalued, with few (or no) apparent use cases.  As a result, the gains to over $400 look to be speculative in nature, unless traders are anticipating use cases to appear.  The price action analysis, though, indicates a correction may be on the way.  At press time, BTG is at $361 – up 4.5 percent for the day, as per CoinMarketCap. Over seven days, the cryptocurrency is up 185 percent.  4-hour chart  The above chart shows:  A bull flag breakout followed by a rejection at the rising trendline hurdle.  The relative strength index is losing altitude, signals bulls are losing control.  A bull flag breakout is a continuation pattern ( i.e. an upside break yesterday meant the rally from the low of $150 has resumed). However, prices failed to cut through the resistance offered by the rising trend line.  View  The weak follow-through to the bull flag breakout indicates exhaustion, and suggests the potential for a drop to $250 levels in the short-run.  However, a break above $400 in the next 12 hours could yield a rally to fresh record highs above $480 levels.

42400700,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKQKl,1511791227,A Crypto Crystal Ball? What If Traders Settled Bitcoin Forks,"Any way you slice it, blockchain software upgrades are proving messy business.  And in some ways, this is by design. Due to the nature of blockchains as opt-in systems, changes to the rules of the code require broad agreement. Everyone with a stake in helping run the protocol must decide not to simply copy what's been created and start fresh, as they have with the ethereum classic and bitcoin cash forks.  But that's not to say technologists aren't searching for a better way, one that improves a process defined by death threats, name-calling, and increasingly, divisions that lead to splits.  So far, one idea that's beginning to attract attention is the use of prediction markets, where traders place bets on future events in an effort to inform the outcome. After bitcoin's most recent hard fork was abandoned, some argue similar markets could shed light on the outcomes of particular changes within the community.  For instance, during the run-up to bitcoin's Segwit2x hard fork, several cryptocurrency exchanges offered a market where traders could weigh in on whether bitcoin would remain the official bitcoin, or whether a Segwit2x chain would be created (and what it's value might be).  On Bitfinex, one of the exchanges that offered such trading tools, the Segwit2x coins traded at about one-tenth the value of bitcoin, leading some to take that as a sign that traders lacked confidence in its eventual approval.  Developer Anthony Towns even made an uncannily apt prediction during the Scaling Bitcoin event earlier this month before Segwit2x was suspended, saying:  ""You don't know if that's a low price because the Segwit2x coin is not going to be very valuable, or if it's because the market's kind of saying that everyone's going to back off and the fork isn't going to happen at all.""  And that prediction displays how futures trading within the crypto space could aid in measuring sentiment about proposed changes.  Towns told CoinDesk that prediction markets potentially offer better insight that other ways of measuring sentiment. For instance, Twitter and other social media polls can be easily manipulated when users create multiple accounts for which to cast a vote.  Plus, there are concerns about echo chambers.  ""Without a market, it's easy to get into a bubble where you're only hearing from people who agree with you,"" he said.  Leading the way  In advance of this year's bitcoin hard forks – leading to chain splits and new cryptocurrencies – a handful of bitcoin exchanges have launched sophisticated futures markets.  But Bitfinex began futures trading even earlier, launching a new kind of token on its site as the Bitcoin Unlimited software took hold in April (that fork never occurred).  Bitfinex also launched futures trading ahead of the bitcoin cash split, and the predictions were fairly accurate. The bitcoin cash futures tokens traded at between 10–20 percent of what bitcoin traded for on the exchange; today, the value of a bitcoin cash token is about 14 percent of a bitcoin.  Ahead of the Segwit2x hard fork, Bitfinex allowed their users to trade in a bitcoin for two futures tokens – one ""BT1"" representing legacy bitcoin and one ""BT2"" representing the new coin that could be created if the Segwit2x hard fork caused a split.  Users could then buy or sell these coins, betting on which one they thought would fare better after the split.  When launching its so-called ""Chain Split Token,"" Bitfinex argued it was offering the community a service (echoing Towns' sentiments) in a blog post, saying:  ""We hope that this innovation brings some much-needed price discovery for the future of the bitcoin ecosystem.""  Continuing disagreements  And in the case of Segwit2x, the futures market did, in a way, hint at the Segwit2x outcome.  Still, there remains uncertainty around what the prices actually mean, both in the short and long term.  What is certain, according to many developers, is that disagreements over future changes to the cryptocurrency protocol will continue, and futures markets could provide insight into the community's sentiment on those issues.  During his Scaling Bitcoin presentation, Towns said, ""I contend that disagreements aren't going to go away. We can't get everyone in the same room ... and come to agreement. No, I think we will continue to have disagreements, and those disagreements will result in a split.""  However, he also argued that prediction markets could be helpful, not only in determining how users feel about the backwards-incompatible hard forks, but also about less disruptive soft forks.  ""I think the way things are going, they'll be needed for the next soft fork as well,"" Towns said.  He points to Segregated Witness (SegWit), a scaling upgrade that was recently added to bitcoin, as a contentious soft fork. Plus, so-called user-activated soft forks (UASFs) can have similar outcomes – splitting the chain into two blockchains with competing cryptocurrencies – if there's substantial disagreement.  Better predictor  So, with prediction markets looking to become valuable tools for measuring support or opposition to protocol changes, at least one researcher is already trying to improve this fortune-telling mechanism.  In October, Bloq economist Paul Sztorc proposed a way to make markets more fair for those participating by allowing people to get their money back if a fork is abandoned.  When Segwit2x was put on hold, users that had bet on that coin lost all their money.  With Sztorc's proposal, though, rather than create two tokens, exchanges would create eight futures tokens ""arranged into two markets, in order to fully partition the space of possible outcomes."" These eight tokens are settled in cash rather than on the blockchain ""because they can allow users to speculate on scenarios/outcomes that may never actually happen.""  And with that, users would be given their money back if no split happened at all.  Towns said he was ""fond"" of Sztorc's proposal, but argued it could be too ""complex"" or could potentially ""draw in lawyers and regulators,"" since it relies on fiat money.  But still, more interest in these markets are likely to continue as crypto enthusiasts become more interested in how hard forks create new value.  When asked about the accuracy of these markets, Towns paraphrased a quote from former UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill, revealing a cautious optimism for how the mechanism could be used in the crypto community:  ""They're the worst thing to rely on, except for everything else that's ever been tried.""

The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization clocked a new lifetime high of $9,9731.51 at 09:00 UTC, as per CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. That came after blowing past $9,000 over the weekend for the first time – and just over a week after topping $8,000.  As of writing, the bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate is trading at $9,630 levels. Going by CoinMarketCap data, BTC has appreciated by 8.24 percent in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency is up more than 800 percent on a year-to-date basis.  Trading volumes  rose to $5.4 billion yesterday, the highest level since Nov. 13 – adding credence to the rally's sustainability. Further, Google search volumes for the term ""bitcoin"" have spiked again.  So, the technical chart looks more bullish than ever, with prices likely to soon test $10,000 levels – and perhaps beyond.  4-hour chart  The chart above shows no signs of stress, bar the overbought conditions indicated by the relative strength index (RSI). When above 70.00, the RSI indicates overbought conditions and could yield a minor pullback, although major tops are made usually on the back of bearish divergence (lower highs on RSI and higher highs on price) and not just overbought RSI.  The major moving averages – 50-Ma, 100-MA, and 200-MA – are sloping upwards in favor of the bulls.  View  With the rising trendline (pattern of higher lows on price chart) well and truly intact, bitcoin looks set to test $10,000 today, and may even extend the rally to $10,400 levels as suggested by the bull flag breakout discussed on Nov. 20.  Only a 4-hour close below the rising trendline would signal a short-term top has been set. At press time, the trendline support is seen at $8,570 levels.

In a research note to clients over the weekend, Mitch Steves of RBC Capital Markets argued that recent double-digit percentage increases in prices for some cryptocurrencies could drive more miners to enter the market, as well as drive established miners to expand their capacity by buying new GPUs.  Mining  – an energy-intensive process by which new transactions are added to a blockchain – has already resulted in notable sales boosts for companies like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), as previously reported by CoinDesk.  ""We are flagging this now, as the payback period has decreased materially which may lead to continued strength in GPU sales related to cryptocurrency mining,” Steves wrote, adding:  ""For illustrative purposes, when the price of ethereum was at $300 the payback period was approximately 9.4 months; today it is now approximately 5.6 months – a change we view as material.""  After bottoming out as low as $286 in early November, ethereum surged to $453 – a 58 percent increase – over the weekend. Monero has nearly doubled in value over the course of the month from $82 to $161, while zcash has surged 49 percent from $213 to $318 during November.  A resurgence in mining demand would be noteworthy because many observers – including Nvidia and AMD, the primary manufacturers of the GPUs used in mining – were predicting just weeks ago that the cryptocurrency mining boom – and thus GPU sales – was beginning to tail off after posting eye-popping sales figures and exhausting inventories in the first half of the year.  In its third-quarter earnings report, Nvidia noted that mining-related GPU revenues were down from $150 million in the second quarter to just $70 million and predicted that trend to continue. Lisa Su, AMD CEO, similarly told investors on her third quarter conference call that ""there will be some leveling-off of some of the cryptocurrency demand.""  According to Steves, that outcome may not be so certain anymore.  While noting that it’s still too early to assess the market's long-term sustainability, Steves said that it is likely due to a confluence of technology improvements and more traditional investors taking interest in mining.  He concluded:  ""The 'cat is out of the bag' so to speak and we wouldn't be surprised to see more and more institutional money and high-net-worth individuals invest in the rapidly growing space.""

The financial resources came from a group of investors which included an unnamed family office based in Europe. Also contributing to the round, according to Libra, was seed-stage VC firm Liberty City Ventures, cryptocurrency market maker XBTO and Lee Linden, an early-stage investor who previously worked for Facebook.      Of that group, Liberty City is a returning investor after putting in $500,000 in a seed stage round in 2014. Libra develops cryptocurrency and blockchain-oriented accounting and tax software, and the new funds will be put toward the development of its Libra Enterprise Platform, the startup said.  ""Libra's vision is to be the premier provider of next-generation accounting, audit, and tax software and data services for the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry,"" Jake Benson, Libra's CEO, said in a statement.              Founded in 2014, Libra first started with offering its LibraTax accounting software, an early entrant in the market for cryptocurrency-specific tax tools. That was the year the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) notably issued guidance stating that it would treat cryptocurrencies like bitcoin as kinds of taxable property.  More recently, the company has eyed the enterprise-level market, developing tools that are aimed in part at exchanges and other trading-oriented companies. Libra added a former chief risk officer from Siemens to its team in May as part of that enterprise push.

The push above $300 billion perhaps also showcases the pace at which the market has grown in recent weeks. On Nov. 3rd, the overall market capitalization rose above $200 billion for the first time.
