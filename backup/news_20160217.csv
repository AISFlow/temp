42378594,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7inQl,1455749156,Mt Gox Bankruptcy Trustee Issues New Details on Creditor Reimbursement,"UPDATE (17th February 23:23 BST):This report has been updated with additional information.      The bankruptcy trustee for the now-defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox has released a new update, offering fresh details on the claims submitted so far.  The report, published today by trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi, states that a total of 24,733 people have filed claims against the bankrupt exchange, 9,863 of which relate to bitcoin holdings lost when Mt Gox went bust in 2014.  The firm filed for bankruptcy just days after details of its insolvency first emerged, with the claims process beginning last spring. Kobayashi would later extend that deadline.  According to the report, creditors claimed ¥40,130,744,194 (roughly $350m) in lost BTC deposits, for which ¥12,583,717,791 (roughly $110m) has been either approved or denied on behalf of 7,952 claimants, according to the report. An additional ¥27,547,026,403 (about $241m) in claims submitted by 1,911 creditors awaits approval by the trustee.  The exchange rate used for the claims is pegged at $483, or¥50,058.12 per BTC. This number is tied to the price of the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index at 23:59 UTC, 23rd April 2014 – just before Mt Gox declared bankruptcy.  Combined bitcoin and fiat deposit claims totaled ¥2,695,239,249,594 (about $2.3bn), and of that amount, ¥25,702,801,244 (about $225m) has been accepted or denied thus far.  In a statement, Kobayashi said that the report’s results reflect an investigation that remains in progress, noting:  ""Although the investigation into Mt Gox claims is still ongoing, we have made significant progress for creditors.""  Kobayashi also disclosed that Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpeles, who was detained last fall on allegations of market manipulation and embezzlement, remains under arrest by Japanese law enforcement. The trustee added that he continues to cooperate with the police regarding their ongoing investigation of the Mt Gox collapse.  ""As matters now stand, investigations are underway, including investigations as to whether there are discrepancies between the activities of BTC on the database, which we are aware of at this time, and the records on the blockchain,"" he said.  Wait-and-see  In the meantime, San Francisco-based bitcoin exchange Kraken has been assisting with the claims and relief distribution efforts.  CEO Jesse Powell told CoinDesk that this week's report is good news for creditors but that many factors, including the outcome of the police investigation and civil lawsuits involving Mt Gox, will impact when creditors may actually receive funds.  Kraken told CoinDesk:  ""Unfortunately it's more wait-and-see. The trustee clearly has a lot more claims to work through and it’s not clear if they will be making a distribution ahead of settling the investigation or some of the pending lawsuits over some of the money.""  The bankruptcy of Mt Gox sent waves through the digital currency world, impacting its investment ecosystem and price, with the full implications of the exchange’s collapse arguably still being felt.  For example, the Japanese government, including officials from the country’s top financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency, have been weighing new rules for domestic bitcoin exchange services amid the investigation into Mt Gox and Karpeles.

42378601,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7inVn,1455744131,Researchers Argue Radical Redesigns Needed to Scale Decentralized Blockchains,"A new research paper has put forth the argument that fundamental changes are needed to the design of decentralized blockchain networks should any iteration of the technology serve as a transaction network for global consumers.  Entitled ""On Scaling Decentralized Blockchains"", the paper was authored by researchers at Berkeley, Cornell, ETH Zurich University, the National University of Singapore and the University of Maryland, including Christian Decker, co-author of the Duplex Micropayments Channels report; and Ittay Eyal, Adem Efe Gencer and Emin Gün Sirer, authors of the Bitcoin-NG proposal.  Though different in intent, both papers were focused on presenting new ideas for how decentralized blockchain networks could scale at a time when the conversation was dominating industry conversation both among major financial institutions, who are seeking to leverage the technology for existing high-volume transaction systems, and bitcoin developers, who are working on solutions to scale the digital currency's transaction capacity.  The increasing popularity of bitcoin as a digital currency has made scalability a ""primary and urgent concern"" for the bitcoin network, the authors say, touching upon a topic that has been hotly debated for months in the bitcoin space.  Overall, the position paper analyses how ""fundamental and circumstantial bottlenecks"" in decentralized, public blockchains like bitcoin limit the ability of its current peer-to-peer network of miners to support substantially higher numbers of transactions at lower latencies.  Likewise, the paper is not concerned with an analysis of permissioned networks, in which a group of entities or entity manages a blockchain-based ledger system in a more centralized manner.  The group's new analysis will be presented at the Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2016 conference, which is being held from 22nd to 26th February in Barbados.  Inherent problems  The statements in the paper echo previous comments from some of the team members, who have been critical about scaling issues they believe are inherent in bitcoin's current design and short-term improvement proposals.  Back in September 2015, some of the researchers spoke to CoinDesk about the ""inherent problems"" in blockchain design.  Ittay Eyal, for example, said then his work on Bitcoin-NG arose over fundamental issues with the design of blockchains that will make scaling any implementation, public or private, a challenge.  He told CoinDesk at the time:  ""For securities markets, for transacting digital assets, if you want to have all of these on a blockchain, you will need significant scaling.""  Notably, in the same month, Eyal also made an appearance at the Scaling Bitcoin event in Montreal, where he introduced Bitcoin-NG as a kind of radical attempt to scale decentralized blockchain networks to match the ambitious of those excited about the technology.  Scientific approach  Overall, the paper looks at whether decentralized blockchains can be scaled up to match the performance of a mainstream payment processors, and how they might achieve such functionality.  The team went on to make three contributions that illuminate the problem of scaling bitcoin and blockchains generally, and offer ways to achieve high-performance, decentralized systems:  'Measurement study and exploration of reparametrization' – the authors attempt to quantify current scalability limits via experimental measurements covering a range of metrics that characterize the resource costs and performance of the bitcoin network.  'Painting a broad design space for scalable blockchains' – concluding that ""fundamental protocol redesign is needed for blockchains to scale significantly while staying decentralized"", the authors suggest various technical approaches are discussed that could help blockchains scale in the future.  'Posing open challenges' – the authors call for better measurement techniques so the health of decentralized systems like bitcoin could be continuously monitored, and further look at the security and robustness of the network following various parameter changes.  Block size is just first step  Supported by their measurement studies, the authors suggest that ""more aggressive"" scaling will, in the longer term, require fundamental redesign to bitcoin's protocol.  They go on to suggest a variety of ""potentially successful"" approaches to such scaling, categorizing some recently proposed and new ideas, and posing a number of open technical challenges for the community going forward.  In conclusion, the paper suggests that the process of reworking the parameters of block size and transaction intervals is only a first step toward achieving ""next-generation, high-load blockchain protocols"", and that for bitcoin to make major advances it will require a ""basic rethinking"" of the underlying code.

42378609,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7injd,1455737596,Dubai Government Backs Expansive Blockchain Research Effort,"An innovation center established by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, vice president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and emir of Dubai, has announced the formation of a research council focused on blockchain technology.  Launched in 2015, the Museum of the Future was created with the mandate to encourage innovation and help foster investigation of new technologies within the Middle Eastern nation. The keystone of the project will be an architectural centre (estimated to cost $136m) and set to be completed in 2017.  According to the release, the Global Blockchain Council will consist of 32 members including government entities (Smart Dubai Office, Dubai Smart Government, the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC), international companies (Cisco, IBM, SAP, Microsoft) and blockchain startups (BitOasis, Kraken and YellowPay).  In the past, Museum of the Future has voiced support for emerging technologies such as drones, as well as the broader applicability of new technologies to education, healthcare and travel. Further, the announcement follows Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan’s declaration that 2015 would serve as a ""year of innovation"" for the Middle Eastern nation.  According to a press release from the government of Dubai’s media office, the Global Blockchain Council will explore and discuss potential applications of blockchain technology, with the goal of highlighting how it could come to impact domestic financial and non-financial business sectors.  In statements, Saif Al Aleeli, CEO of Dubai Museum of the Future Foundation, explained the importance of the initiative, given statistics he cited that suggest global blockchain investments could reach $300bn over the next four years.  Al Aleeli said:  ""The Global Blockchain Council will launch different initiatives under its umbrella to highlight and promote blockchain and digital currencies, and explore its advantages and disadvantages. It will also draw a roadmap for best uses of this emerging technology.""  He further stated that the group’s efforts will include the creation of an annual conference that will host “high-profile individuals, workshops, awareness sessions [and] hackathons"".  Dr. Aisha Bin Bishr, director general of Smart Dubai Office, an initiative overseeing Dubai's interests in smart cities, added that the Global Blockchain Council will seek to unite both public and private industry stakeholders for the efforts.  ""New technologies such as blockchain open significant opportunities for all service providers to reshape transactions, making experiences more seamless and secure for all customers,"" Bin Bishr said in the release.  Additional statements were given by the CEO of the Dubai International Financial Centre Authority (DIFCA), an agency that reports to the UAE’s president on “economic development and planning, registry of companies and administration of companies law and data protection law,” according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF); and the operator of Nasdaq Dubai, formerly the Dubai International Financial Exchange.  First pilot project  As part of the announcement, the Museum of the Future detailed pilot projects it will embark on for the initiative.  The first pilot project, according to the release, will find Dubai-based bitcoin services startup BitOasis working with the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC), which was created in 2002 to establish a commodities marketplace in Dubai.  BitOasis will work with the DMCC to ""secure flexidesk contracts and registration process using the blockchain ledger"" as a means to help the organization ""stay ahead of the curve"" while providing guidance on the technology to other market participants, according to Ahmed Bin Sulayem, Executive Chairman of Dubai Multi Commodities Centre Authority.  A second project will find the DMCC working with bitcoin exchange Kraken to ""help DMCC catalyze"" blockchain technology in select Islamic finance operations.  ""It is therefore a natural next step for DMCC to play our part in not only piloting the BitOasis and Kraken Bitcoin Exchange projects, but to do everything we can to bring more projects like these to market in the future in collaboration with the Dubai Blockchain Council,"" Bin Sulayem said.  Points of confusion  Despite the strong signal of interest from the UAE, there were signs in its release that suggest its views on the technology remain in early stages.  For example, language included suggested that ""Blockchain supports more than two million bitcoin wallets"", inferred that there may be confusion at the institution between the bitcoin wallet startup Blockchain, and bitcoin’s underlying distributed ledger, referred to as the blockchain.  ""Blockchain is available worldwide in more than 15 languages, and allows the user to send bitcoin by emails and text message, while still maintaining the user’s privacy and security,"" the release read. Notably, Blockchain was not one of the members mentioned as part of the initial Global Blockchain Council.  Elsewhere, the language similarly blurred the lines between bitcoin, the digital currency, and blockchain, a term often used to denote its distributed ledger applications.  ""The blockchain market reports that the average volume of bitcoin transactions in 24 hours is $105.6m, and the bitcoin market cap is averaged at $6.8bn,"" the release said.  Nonetheless, the ambitious program marks a milestone for the technology in a region where there have been few major industry announcements.

42378600,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7inZZ,1455728160,New Australian Political Party Seeks to Popularize Blockchain Voting,"A new Australian political party has proposed the introduction of a token-based political system based on the concept of decentralised blockchain technology.  Called the Flux Party, the new entity has already attracted more than the 500 members it needs to potentially place senate candidates on ballots in all the country's states. However, the party's immediate goal is to try and elect six senators, according to Reuters.  Notably, the Flux Party will be free of its own policies, instead opting for its senators to vote for or against legislation at the bidding of token holders.  Party co-founder Max Kaye told the news source:  ""If they didn't have to be senators, if they could just be software or robots they would be, because their only purpose is to do what the people want them to do.""  At election time, the bitcoin-like tokens would be issued to Flux members – as well as single-issue campaigners that support the party. The tokens can then be used either use to vote, trade with others or give to trusted third parties to carry out proxy votes.  The results of the voting would be distributed proportionately – for example, with an 80% to 20% vote in favor of a bill, five Flux senators would vote for and one against.  Suggesting that the current democratic system is too antiquated for the Internet era, Kaye told Reuters that, while ministers sometimes do not have expertise on all issues, they are trusted with making vital decisions on policies affecting environmental or monetary policy.  The Flux Party system would mean that large numbers of of voters could effectively grant their votes to experts such as scientists or economists on these issues.  Describing itself as a ""layer for the redistribution of political power"", Flux says on its website:  ""Our current system doesn't work well enough; politics gets in the way of policy. Flux is an incremental upgrade to democracy designed to redistribute political power, maximise participation, remove bad policy, and empower voters.""  Initial critiques  While Flux's proposed voting system is potentially workable, bitcoin expert Dr Adrian Lee from the University of Technology Sydney told Reuters the absence of a legal mechanism to ensure senators vote as directed could be problematic for the party.  The concept of blockchain-based voting systems is not a new one. Just days ago, stock market giant Nasdaq revealed it is developing an electronic shareholder voting system for the Estonian stock market based on blockchain technology.  And, almost exactly a year ago, the Bitcoin Foundation allowed members to cast votes in an election round directly on the bitcoin blockchain, though this test was not without issues.

42378599,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7inYJ,1455722106,European Central Bank Exploring Blockchain Tech Applications,"The European Central Bank (ECB) has said that it is investigating how it might apply blockchain technology for its own purposes.  The statement was made in a new consultation report on the technologies used to run the region's securities and payments settlement systems and how they can be improved.  The ECB said that, as part of its consultation process, it is looking at how blockchain applications could improve or hamper this market infrastructure.  The report notes:  ""As part of its vision, the Eurosystem intends to assess their relevance for the different services it provides to the banking communities (payments, securities settlement as well as collateral). This investigation will identify opportunities that these new technologies may provide, as well as the challenges that they create.""  The ECB has spoken out about digital currencies in the past, describing them as “inherently unstable” in a report published last March. At the time, the central bank acknowledged that the technology could have an impact on its ability to conduct monetary policy.  Yet officials from the ECB have previously expressed an openness to digital currencies and blockchain tech more generally.  Yves Mersch, a member of the central bank's executive board, told attendees at a banking conference last month in Paris that innovative new payments technologies like the blockchain have the potential to disrupt card-based payments and the broader financial system.  ""These technologies, of which Blockchain is probably the best-known example, can potentially have a profound impact on whole financial 'ecosystem',"" he said.

42378642,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7inm9,1455715206,IBM Goes Big on Blockchain Unveiling Services Suite and Strategy,"Weeks of public statements on blockchain tech culminated yesterday with IBM unveiling a comprehensive strategy that found the IT giant diving deep for the first time into how it will seek to deliver business solutions based on the emerging technology.  While IBM had previously gone public with its work with its leading role in the Linux-led Hyperledger Project, and had been open about its theses on the approach of other providers, the announcement can viewed as the opening salvo that signals its charge into the industry armed with a depth and overall presentation that are unique among its peers.  All told, IBM revealed the central pieces to what it said is a years-in-the-making strategy, including how its blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) offering will incorporate existing company assets such as IBM z Systems, its core IT system for top 100 global banks; the Watson Internet of Things (IoT) platform; and Bluemix Garage, its development workshop initiative.  With the news, IBM becomes the second major tech giant to launch a BaaS offering, alongside Microsoft, which has added a flurry of blockchain technology providers to its development sandbox since its unveiling in October.  In interview, IBM's vice president of blockchain technologies Jerry Cuomo expanded on the difference in his company’s market strategy, complementing Microsoft for its service and the ability of those who use it to quickly launch test blockchain networks, but stressing what he believes is a considerable, underlying difference.  Cuomo sought to position Microsoft as more open in its view on the available blockchain networks, whereas with IBM’s BaaS service, business clients will use the IBM Blockchain fabric, a public-but-proprietary offering he contends was crafted with a specific vision.  Cuomo told CoinDesk:  ""What we're doing is we’re picking a specific fabric and a specific point of view. We’re not interested in any fabric, we’re interested in one that can support business applications. We’re a bit more opinionated on what fabric is needed.""  Cuomo described IBM’s new consensus algorithm as offering improvements in privacy and auditability that would allow businesses to be able to create blockchain applications for a wide variety of specific use cases, with arguably unmatched speed and support.  Initial users of the platform include impressive brand names such as the London Stock Exchange (LSE), Kouvola Innovation and Japan Exchange Group, operator of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, suggesting the message is resonating to potential enterprise users.  Blockchain DNA  Perhaps given the number of announcements, Cuomo was keen to unpack the terminology surrounding the release, explaining the IBM Blockchain fabric and how it differs in aim from other available blockchain networks.  To Cuomo, the term ""fabric"" refers to the basic ""DNA of a blockchain"" as well as a business network across which transactions can be replicated and members can access a shared ledger.  ""The ledger has three properties,"" Cuomo explained. ""It is replicated, when you make an entry it is proposed to all the ledgers and committed at once, so all ledgers are in sync. It’s permissioned, while you have access you’re only allowed to see what you’re allowed to see based on permissioned, and you can perform business logic on the ledger.""  The latter attribute, he said, will allow users to create transactions that have logic, such as programmable contracts that would govern how an asset would be managed over a specific length of time or under certain conditions.  ""The fabric enables a ledger, it enables a network to be created,"" he added.  In its release, IBM elaborated on technical details, stating the service will feature a ""pluggable architecture"" to allow users to experiment with different software modules; cryptographic identity management tools and smart contracts written in Java and Golang; and privacy and confidentiality controls that allow users to specify who can view and execute smart contracts.  The functionality differs greatly from current public blockchains, such as bitcoin and Ethereum, in which any participant can join the network and participate in its operation. Further, its smart contract offerings are written in more familiar development languages, whereas Ethereum, for example, uses wholly new languages.  Intersection with Hyperledger  The BaaS offering also features some overlap with its work on the Hyperledger Project, a separate collaborative effort that has so far united 30 industry stakeholders, including startups, financial incumbents and potential end-users of the technology, all with the goal of creating an open-source blockchain offering.  IBM’s consensus algorithm, Cuomo remarked, will use 44,000 lines of code it has contributed to the Hyperledger Project as a founding member, but remain a distinct offering due to its value-added services.  ""Everything we use is all based on that code, other than the value on top of it,"" Cuomo said. ""What we’ve added is the ability to orchestrate and stand up a blockchain network, [and] a set of samples and we have another set of services planned.""  As an example of what this test environment allows, IBM included a sample blockchain application on its website in which developers can experiment with asset transactions.  ""We have a simple example called a ‘Marbles App’, that allows you to create an exchange for creating and exchanging marbles. This helps developers understand the basics for blockchain, the definition of an asset, in this case it’s a marble of different size and color, and the ability to exchange assets between members,"" Cuomo said.  IBM intends to launch additional demos on its website, with its page displaying as-yet-unlaunched demos including a ""Smart Contract Investigator"", which will allow developers to experiment with smart contracts; and a ""Car Lease Demo"" that will provide an overview of blockchain-based supply chain applications.  Open for collaboration  Cuomo framed the service as one that would enable users to collaborate within its cloud, stating that users can use the technology to connect with peers.  As with the Azure service, the offering is still in testing, opening to developers first with the goal of scaling it so that, eventually, production versions of blockchains created within the offering can be launched publicly.  Cuomo cited Japan Exchange Group as a company with such aims, working on proofs-of-concepts (POCs) aimed at innovating on systems for the exchange of low-liquidity assets. “They’re starting using our test services with the goal of graduating,” he added.  According to Nikkei, Japan Exchange Group intends to release a report on the initial fundings of the study based on its work with the service later this year, while LSE indicated it intends to create projects aimed at managing risk and promoting transparency in global markets  Here again, Cuomo acknowledged there is some overlap between Hyperledger and IBM’s work, as Japan Exchange Group is also working on the former project's technical committee, in part, because of its aspiration to include regulators in its projects.  ""The exchanges getting involved want to make sure their regulators have access to the code, so they’re involved in the Hyperledger Project. But we’re working with them with our hosted services,"" Cuomo said.  Cuomo went on to suggest that he sees such business activity around both IBM’s consensus algorithm and the Hyperledger Project sending a positive signal to regulators, as its clients want to ensure their projects meet the approval of global government agencies.  He added:  ""It's another reason why you want to be part of the open environment, regulators are not going to endorse all the fabrics out there, but we hope that with business rallying around certain ones, maybe they'll be able to endorse one or two.""  Quick to market  Key to IBM’s offerings, Cuomo said, will be their ability to leverage existing offerings such as IBM z Systems, its system of mainframe computers and distributed server technologies.  On its website, IBM touts that its z Systems offering could take blockchain performance to ""new levels"" given that the system can handle ""massive amounts of transaction data"".  ""Accelerate time to value and reduce complexity and cost by accessing System of Record transactional systems and data already on z Systems,"" the company’s ""How Can IBM Help?"" section of its blockchain domain reads.  Cuomo said that z Systems would allow users to ""tune their fabric"", encrypting transactions as they’re passed along the network and validated by peers.  ""z Systems has been known for its ability to perform cryptography at high scale, so the system should be able to scale more readily when run on z Systems. It looks like a platform that was made for this workload,"" he added.  Coming soon, the company plans to launch its IBM Blockchain DevOps service, which Cuomo said would allow clients to set up mini-blockchain networks in as little as 12 seconds.  To help its potential clients better understand these aspects of its technology in the meantime, IBM is launching IBM Bluemix Garages in London, New York, Singapore and Tokyo that will seek to provide in-person support to developers looking to design and implement blockchain POCs.  There, Cuomo said IBM will offer clients the chance to engage in “90-minute interactive sessions” with subject matter experts who can help them make their ideas actionable at impressive speeds. Telepresence and web conferences are also available to clients.  Cuomo believes clients will find value in that they will be able to use his team’s knowledge to quickly make the technology actionable.  He concluded:  “We bring our design team to bear… We exit garage with the plan to do a 30-60 day POC.”  More information on IBM’s full range of offerings can be found here.
