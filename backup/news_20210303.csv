42433784,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP5M3h,1614814229,Controversial Dapps Test Binance Smart Chain’s Decentralization,"Anonymous developers have built two controversial decentralized applications (dapps) on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), a smart contract-based blockchain backed by exchange giant Binance, daring the platform to censor the dapps.      The developers apparently hope the offensive and sensitive nature of the dapps would force Binance to get rid of them, proving BSC, unlike Ethereum, is not decentralized and can be controlled by a centralized institution, said Jason Wu, CEO and founder of decentralized crypto lending platform DeFiner. He noted that BSC has far fewer nodes than Ethereum.      One dapp with a token is called Tanks of Tiananmen. It appeared on Binance’s blockchain on Thursday. The name refers to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, which the Chinese government considers a very sensitive topic. The other dapp, Slavery, showed up on BSC on Saturday. It seems to liken the yield farming mechanism to slavery.      The two dapps are still on BSC as of press time.      Some in the Ethereum community have reason to resent BSC. “Binance Smart Blockchain is very similar to Ethereum in a lot of ways,” Wu said. “Some devs might feel [it’s] unfair that an Ethereum copycat is doing so well.”      The move comes at a time when BSC is gaining traction in hosting decentralized exchanges (DEX), some of which have migrated their business from Ethereum to BSC due to the latter’s lower trading cost. 1inch, one of the most popular DEX aggregators, expanded its businesses to BSC on Feb. 25, citing Ethereum’s high “gas” transaction fees.      “Transactions per second for Ethereum have reached their peak for a long time and the excessive demand will flow to other blockchains,” said Hongfei Da, founder of decentralized blockchain platform Neo. “BSC’s technical infrastructure and community are well positioned to take in the demand.”      High gas fees and transaction speed on Ethereum are not the only reasons why dapps are moving to BSC. The blockchain is backed by crypto exchange giant Binance, so automated market makers (AMMs) could get more liquidity from the exchange while getting more publicity from Binance promoting the DEX’s products, said Aries Wang, co-founder of crypto exchange Bibox.      “Many dapps, ranging from AMMs to lending platforms, could have a jump-start if they run on BSC with the preferential yield farming models offered by the platform to increase their native tokens to a high level even in these projects’ early stage,” Wang said.      PancakeSwap, a DEX native to BSC, has been closing in on Ethereum-based UniSwap in terms of total value locked (TVL). On Feb.19, Binance Coin (BNB) saw a 45% increase when PancakeSwap “flippened” Uniswap in 24 hours.      In a recent tweet, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhou said Ethereum could be its own killer and compared the network to some now-defunct social media companies.      “Perhaps social media is the best example,” Zhao said in his tweet on Saturday. Friendster and MySpace were hugely popular but couldn't keep up with the user/demand growth, he said.      “Demand is growing exponentially, performance of ETH [isn’t],” he said. The Ethereum 2.0 update would take years, while the other solution to Ethereum’s scalability problem, rollups, which are off-chain aggregation of transactions inside an Ethereum smart, is not user friendly, Zhao said.",NEUTRAL,ETH | BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/03/controversial-dapps-test-binance-smart-chains-decentralization,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2088085176c6dd202f253d0321e0057945ded247-1500x917.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433790,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP5MBh,1614812244,"Federal Credit Union Regulator Should Look at Crypto Rules, Official Says","The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) could be the next federal regulator to dip its feet into crypto-related rules.      Credit unions will want to look at digital assets and blockchain technology, said NCUA Vice Chairman Kyle Hauptman in a speech Wednesday. Speaking to the Credit Union National Association Governmental Affairs Conference, Hauptman said his regulatory agency may consider providing guidance around the treatment of digital assets.      Credit unions are nonprofit, member-owned financial institutions that provide similar services to banks in the U.S. While national banks are regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), credit unions are overseen by the NCUA.      “NCUA may want to look at the actions taken by another regulator, the OCC. That agency recently provided guidance around custody of digital assets and the use of stablecoins for payments,” Hauptman said during his speech. “Stablecoins, as you may know, are cryptocurrencies designed to minimize price volatility, and the OCC’s guidance moves the U.S. closer to the real-time payment systems already used in other countries.”      The NCUA may not want to recreate every piece of guidance the OCC published, but Hauptman said he looks forward to working with NCUA Chairman Tood Harper to see what can help credit unions innovate.      Hauptman told CoinDesk prior to his speech that the NCUA is the federal regulator and insurer for the more than 5,000 credit unions in the U.S., which collectively hold some $1.5 trillion in deposits.      ""At some point, we’ll speak with NCUA staff about doing a side-by-side with what the OCC did and see what we do or don’t want to adapt for credit unions. NCUA benefits a bit from ‘somebody else went first,’ so we can, where appropriate, build on the OCC’s experience,” he told CoinDesk.      He pointed to ATMs and remote deposits as examples of past innovative tools that credit unions implemented.      He likened decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoins to the introduction of smart phones and mobile banking.      “Smart phones didn’t exist 20 years ago and thus there weren’t regulations around mobile banking,” he said. “Policymakers then, obviously, had to provide clarity or risk seeing regulated institutions slowly lose business to new technologies.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/03/03/federal-credit-union-regulator-should-look-at-crypto-rules-official-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2b42cf7d5510b6a3fbdc2e8bab54554d1b942d16-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

SushiSwap, which has some $3.3 billion in liquidity and $300 million in 24 hour volume, was formerly only hosted on the Ethereum blockchain, which is currently suffering under increasingly high transaction fees. Many Ethereum-based projects have been scrambling for scaling solutions, such as Rollups or moving to another blockchain that supports ERC-20 styled digital assets.      The exchange first garnered attention after copying Uniswap's open source code, adding a token and then diverting liquidity away from Uniswap towards itself with the novel ""vampire mining"" program. Since then, the project has professionalized, particularly with the addition of Delong.      Delong said SushiSwap is eyeing an integration with Optimism’s Layer 2 solution, Optimistic Rollups. Optimism – closed a $25 million Series B with Andreessen Horowitz in February – is expected to go live on mainnet later this month.

The data was gathered from a survey of 1,800 respondents over the course of the last couple of days. Respondents included employees of Twitter, Amazon, JPMorgan and a variety of other companies.      The survey asked respondents whether they trust cryptocurrency, whether they own any and whether they would accept cryptocurrency as payment as part of their total compensation.      “The most surprising takeaway from this survey is that only half of survey respondents trust cryptocurrency,” said Fiorella Riccobono, who ran the survey and collected the data. “Given companies like Tesla, PayPal, Square, and Twitter have all shown their exposure to bitcoin, I expected their confidence to trickle into the tech industry and their respective employees more.”    Who trusts crypto more?    Interestingly, employees of big banks seemed to trust crypto more than those in tech jobs.      For example, 90% of professionals at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and 70% of Goldman Sachs professionals say they trust cryptocurrency. This seemingly is in line with a renewed interest in cryptocurrencies by institutional investors during the currency bull run, including Goldman Sachs re-launching of its crypto trading desk on March 1 after a three-year hiatus. Comparably, only 52% of professionals at Amazon and 50% of Apple professionals trust cryptocurrency.

Meanwhile, an Amazon professional posted that one of his or her concerns is that people who don't understand blockchains generally don't mentally separate blockchain utilization (e.g., cryptocurrency) from the underlying technology that makes everything possible (the blockchain itself).      “It's concerning because if people don't make that distinction, then the failure of one or more trending cryptos will cause people to mentally write off the benefits or the potential benefits of the underlying technology,” the anonymous professional wrote. “That's why I've been looking at investing in currencies that exist on underlying systems that I think are scalable beyond simple payment ledgers.”      And as one professional at LinkedIn put it:    Just bought around 100K worth of bitcoin.

The move is the basis of forthcoming product Brave Search, which Brave is pitching as a non-tracking alternative to Google Search on Chrome and mobile.    “The Tailcat search engine is built on top of a completely independent index, capable of delivering the quality people expect, but without compromising their privacy,” read a blog post announcing the acquisition. “Tailcat does not collect IP addresses or use personally identifiable information to improve search results.”  Brave Search is a new addition to the suite of Brave’s privacy products. In 2021, Brave has reached over 25 million active monthly users according to the company, and sees this growth in line with consumers moving towards privacy-focused products like Signal and others.  Brave Search is being developed with similar protections to the Brave Browser, including not tracking or profiling users, using open ranking models to “prevent algorithmic biases and outright censorship” and offering Brave Search to other search engines, among a number of other areas.  The blog post also noted that Brave will be exploring “blockchain-based options and new developments, including for e-commerce uses.”  “The only way to counter Big Tech with its bad habit of collecting personal data is to develop a robust, independent and privacy-preserving search engine that delivers the quality users have come to expect. People should not be forced to choose between privacy and quality,” said Dr. Josep M. Pujol, head of the Tailcat project, in a statement accompanying the announcement.  The move comes as privacy continues to grow in profile to a real market advantage.

42433804,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP5Mbh,1614809649,How to Buy Bitcoin at an 80% Premium From Michael Saylor,"Few people have captured the imagination of the cryptocurrency market quite like MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, a guest on Wednesday morning’s First Mover on CoinDesk TV.      His company’s purchases of bitcoin, first announced in August, validated a key narrative driving the current bull market: the “institutions” were joining the fray (companies fitting crypto’s definition of an institution can be far more modest in size, and commercial rather than financial in mission, than Wall Street’s). It took a couple of months more of bitcoin prices languishing around the $10,000 level before really taking off in the final quarter of 2020 but after that, it hasn’t looked back. Well, at least not yet.    Lawrence Lewitinn, CFA is CoinDesk's managing editor for global capital markets and a former fixed-income, currencies and commodities trader who began his career on Wall Street nearly three decades ago. This article first appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Subscribe here.    MicroStrategy's series of bitcoin purchases have been a triumph. As Saylor noted in a recent tweet, the company has thus far spent $2.186 billion to buy a total of 90,859 BTC. That puts its average cost at $24,063. At current prices, MicroStrategy’s bitcoin was worth $4.4 billion as of March 2.      A $2.2 billion gain in value for an asset on the balance sheet of a company that had been worth around $1 billion for the prior three years is usually considered a good thing.      Usually.    Back of the envelope    Yet, it should be noted that while MicroStrategy bought bitcoin at $24,063, which now looks like a bargain, it’s a different story for anyone buying MSTR stock now.      The company’s market cap is now about $7.2 billion. As of March 2, $4.4 billion of its assets were in bitcoin. Around the time it first announced its bitcoin buys, MicroStrategy's market cap was just $1.3 billion. To buy all that bitcoin it now owns, the company at first used some cash, somewhere to the tune of around $425 million. In recent months, it has issued a total of $1.7 billion in convertible notes that, if turned to equity, could add a couple million shares to the nearly 10 million already outstanding (that's another discussion).      Doing some paper napkin math – adding the value of the bitcoin and the underlying company while subtracting the debt and the cash spent (to avoid double-counting) – the sum is $3.575 billion. Rounding that up to $3.6 billion and it's still just half the current market cap.      The remaining $3.6 billion needed to get to a $7.2 billion valuation can be explained as … magic. Well, at least to some investors buying the stock now. Otherwise, that $3.6 billion premium is a bet on value that has yet to be unlocked. It’s a bet that Michael Saylor and the rest of management is able to do incredible things with the company, like buy a lot of bitcoin before everyone else.      So far, it's been a profitable bet for those who were lucky to get in at the right time. MicroStrategy shares have significantly outperformed bitcoin's price since the start of September.    Tfw no ETF    Indeed, the argument made for buying MicroStrategy’s stock right now is that it’s one of the few ways for institutional investors otherwise barred from getting into bitcoin because of regulatory issues (such as no bitcoin exchange-traded fund) to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies. However, it’s a very, VERY expensive way to do so.      That's because paying a $3.6 billion premium for MicroStrategy’s leveraged bitcoin hoard of $4.4 billion works out to roughly $88,000 per bitcoin, more than triple the $24,063 the company paid to acquire it over the past few months. Remember, buying MicroStrategy shares now isn't the same as buying shares back in August.      Thus, if anyone is buying MicroStrategy’s stock solely for the bitcoin play, that person (or “institution”) would be paying nearly double for the bitcoin and getting a flat-lining stock.      Will that premium still be there should a Gary Gensler-led Securities and Exchange Commission decide to approve a bitcoin ETF? Who knows? Weirder things have happened.      The stock may well continue to rally. In this environment, anything can happen. If shares in a declining video game retailer can skyrocket, what’s to stop investors from wanting to pay double for bitcoin?

A fourth defendant, Samuel Reed, was arrested last year and subsequently released on bond. A Vanity Fair profile on Hayes and the BitMEX saga was published on Feb. 4.      Hayes is currently in Singapore, Greenwood told District Judge John Koeltl, of the Southern District of New York, according to the transcript.      “We have discussed with counsel how to arrange for a voluntary surrender, and he has proposed appearing within the United States in Hawaii and having his initial appearance there and then,” she said in the transcript.      Greenwood said Hayes could continue to reside abroad, traveling to Hawaii for virtual appearances during the initial stages of the legal process. He would travel to New York if and when the case proceeds to the trial phase.      “That is the proposed bail package that we would be presenting for your Honor,” she said, according to the transcript. “It would include agreement by the government that he be permitted to continue to reside abroad and that he would be traveling to the United States, if necessary, for court appearances and meetings with counsel.”      Delo is planning to surrender in New York, Greenwood said in the court transcript, though he needs assistance entering the U.S. due to an ongoing travel ban for travelers from the United Kingdom, where he resides.

We are confident that justice will prevail,” said Pavel Pogodin, an attorney representing former BitMEX users suing the platform. Pogodin was the first to surface the potential surrender dates on Twitter on Wednesday.      100x Group, the parent firm to BitMEX, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York did not immediately return requests for comment.

42433801,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP5MXh,1614807511,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Reclaims $50K as Bulls Eye Uptrend Revival,"Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $50,500 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), gaining 6.4% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $52,636.22 to $47,332.82.  Continuing a strong start to the month, bitcoin finally reclaimed $50,000 as bullish investors hope for a revival of the uptrend from early February.    Bitcoin rose 5% on Wednesday to just above $50,000, and traders are speculating whether the move represents a resumption of this year’s powerful bull market or simply a rebound following last week’s steep plunge to around $43,000.      The largest cryptocurrency is now up 10% so far in March, and a gain this month would mark the sixth straight monthly increase, the first time that’s happened in seven years.      Read more: Why Cisco Should Buy Bitcoin      As of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), bitcoin was changing hands just above $51,000 on Coinbase. The largest cryptocurrency is still well off its all-time-high price above $58,000 reached late last month.      “A week is a long time in crypto: A $43,000 print and the retracement seen last week may as well have happened 6 months ago,” Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the digital-asset exchange firm EQUOS, wrote on Wednesday. “If the market can hold above support at $47,850, then a continued push at higher prices is the likely outcome.”      Market analyst Joseph Young tweeted the latest breach of $50,000 has come with signs the market is rejuvenated, with derivative-funding costs returning to normal from last week’s elevated levels, few signs of overcrowding in the futures market and blockchain data showing that institutional investors are preparing to hold for the long term.      In other words, the market now appears to have fully reset after last week’s comedown, which might make a fresh rally more sustainable.    Ether Up but a Troubling Sign    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rose along with bitcoin on Wednesday. It reached around $1,650, climbing 7% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      One potentially troubling sign: Despite the asset’s strong performance to start the month, shareholders of Grayscale’s ether trust don’t appear so bullish. The difference between the price of ether, as implied in prices for the Grayscale vehicle, and spot cryptocurrency prices turned negative on Tuesday after briefly flipping positive earlier this week.      Read more: ETH: Technology Play or Store of Value? A CoinDesk Research Report      According to data from Skew, the Grayscale ether trust had a premium of -4.62%, possibly a sign that investors are cashing out of their shares even as ether buyers accumulate via spot markets or other investment vehicles. (Grayscale is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which owns CoinDesk.)      Another explanation could be that the negative premium represents increased competition among providers of publicly traded ether products. An application was recently filed in Canada for what would be North America’s second ether ETF, CoinDesk reported Tuesday.      Along with ether, decentralized finance assets were in the green on Wednesday. The sector gained an aggregate 9.5%, according to data from Messari.

42433785,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP5M7h,1614804507,Regulation Could Actually Help Tether,"If you follow the cryptocurrency scene, by now you'll have heard about Tether's settlement with the New York Attorney General's office.      The settlement marks a big win for stablecoin users. For the next two years, Tether will be required to live up to some of the same regulatory standards as its licensed stablecoin competitors. That means tether (USDT) stablecoins will be safer for the public to use.    J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.    It might even be good for Tether, too. Of late, the company's blistering growth has been slowing – the market just doesn't seem to trust it. Some oversight might alter its trajectory.      For those who aren’t aware of either Tether or its settlement with the New York Attorney General, here’s a quick introduction. Tether's self-named stablecoin is the largest in the cryptocurrency universe, with some $35 billion tethers in circulation.      The New York Attorney General's office launched an investigation into Tether in 2019 for fraud. After months of picking through Tether documents, it finally settled with Tether last month.      See also: Questions About Tether Just Won’t Go Away. Does the Crypto Market Care?      In the settlement agreement, the Attorney General accuses Tether of being dishonest with customers by describing tether stablecoins as fully backed by dollars. Rather than keeping customer funds safely invested in dollars “safely deposited in our bank accounts,” Tether routinely diverted customer funds towards an assortment of risky assets. These included a potentially non-recoverable claim on Crypto Capital Corp, a fraudulent third-party payments processor, and a risky loan to an affiliate company, Bitfinex. Tether even deposited millions of dollars of customer money into a Bank of Montreal account held in its lawyer's name.      These misrepresentations would be less concerning if Tether was just a tiny run-of-the-mill payments company. It isn't. Consider this. Fintech behemoth PayPal had around $35 billion in customer balances at the end of 2020. Tether says it hit the $35 billion mark this month. That means it has accomplished in just seven years what took PayPal 23 years.      So Tether, a company that seems to be held together with spit and duct tape, has suddenly become one of the largest U.S. dollar payments platforms in the world ranked by customer balances.      No one ever worries about PayPal dollars falling below $1. But speculation that Tether could break its peg is routine in the crypto community. People have good reason to trust the stability of PayPal dollars. PayPal is regulated on a state-by-state level as a money transmitter. Tether is unregulated. That is, it is not beholden to any financial regulatory framework.    Tether says that it hit the $35 billion mark this month. That means it has accomplished in just seven years what took PayPal 23 years.    For instance, PayPal could never have lent its customers' funds to a dodgy third-party payments processor. If it did, it would have been breaking the law. As part of its licensing requirements, PayPal is prohibited from investing customer funds in risky assets. If it did make an illegal investment, PayPal couldn’t hide it. It is required to regularly submit audited financial statements to state financial supervisors.      For its part, Tether is incorporated in the British Virgins Islands, which does not have a financial regulatory framework for protecting customers of money transmitters. And so Tether can do things that PayPal can't.      See also: NY AG’s $850M Probe of Bitfinex, Tether Ends in an $18.5M Settlement      But the settlement changes this. It requires Tether to provide customers with plenty of useful information about how it invests their money. Specifically, each quarter Tether will have to inform the public about the percentage of reserves that are held as cash, loans, securities and amounts due from affiliates. And so for the first time, Tether customers may finally have enough information to verify whether their choice to hold tether is commensurate with underlying risk.      There are a few other measures Tether will have to take. Notably, it will have to provide the Attorney General’s office with proof that it is segregating customer funds from company and affiliate accounts. The commingling of funds is just one of many practices that made tethers unsafe. And Tether will also have to regularly provide the Attorney General with a list of its payment processors, along with location and contact information.      The settlement will expire after two years. But until then, unregulated Tether will be regulated-ish. And so, courtesy of the New York Attorney General, Tether users are all a bit safer.    Regulation for good    I'd argue that a bit of regulation, and the extra trust that it could engender, is exactly what Tether needs.      Regulated stablecoins like USD coin (USDC) and paxos standard (PAX) were first launched in 2018. Like PayPal, the issuers of these stablecoins are licensed and must abide by the rules set out in state financial regulatory frameworks.      But despite new competition, unregulated tether remained the most popular stablecoin. Its four-year head start had allowed it to become the standard dollar brand for Asian cryptocurrency exchanges and for inter-exchange arbitrageurs. Tether's new stablecoin competitors might be safer, but they couldn't replicate tether's liquidity. Tether usage was locked-in, much like how QWERTY remains the world's standard keyboard configuration.      But network effects don't last forever.      Over the last six months, Tether's dominance has been declining. Whereas there used to be 10 tethers in circulation against its largest competitor, USDC, now there are only four tethers for each USDC.      Much of tether's erosion can be attributed to the huge growth of decentralized finance, or DeFi, the set of financial tools created on the Ethereum network that allow for borrowing, lending and trading. DeFi tools require safe and stable collateral as grist. When DeFi began to take off in 2020, these tools began to ingest significant quantities of stablecoins.      DeFi has consciously tried to shut Tether out.      For instance, the largest DeFi protocol – MakerDAO – allows people to take out loans with stablecoins as collateral. People who submit stablecoins that are supervised under a financial regulatory framework (i.e., USDC, True USD, Gemini and PAX) currently pay a yearly borrowing rate of just 0%. But users that submit USDT as collateral are charged an usurious 8%.      There is another way that the deck is stacked against tether. Maker subjects all tether loans to a hefty 150% collateralization ratio. That is, a $100 loan from MakerDAO requires $150 worth of tether collateral. But regulated stablecoins like USDC enjoy slim collateral ratios of just 101%.      MakerDAO administrators say they treat tether this way because of its ""history of opaqueness and fractional reserve."" The result is there is almost $700 million in USDC collateral locked up in MakerDAO, almost 10% of all USDC in existence. But there are just a measly 709 tethers in MakerDAO.      See also: What a Transparent Tether Means for Bitcoin      Nor is MakerDAO the only DeFi protocol to discriminate against Tether. Compound and Aave, the two largest pure lending protocols, do not allow USDT to serve as collateral for loans. Compound's decision is based on reports that tether is ""undercollateralized"" and has the ""potential to collapse at any time."" Compound has over $2 billion in USDC. But it has just $320 million in USDT.      Against its wishes, Tether is now a New York-regulated financial firm. It will grudgingly have to make its financials public. Assuming they like what they see come reporting time, Tether skeptics may start to rethink their distaste. DeFi protocols like Maker and Compound may even lighten their tether penalties, thus gobbling up more tether.      And who knows, maybe Tether will, after a taste of oversight, try to come in from the cold and apply for a money transmitter license like everyone else. Whether it will qualify is another matter.

42421778,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpvqf,1614802074,Internet Deplatforming as Class Warfare,"Here at CoinDesk, we use the term “crypto-adjacent” to categorize stories that aren’t about cryptocurrency or blockchains per se but illustrate the problems these technologies attempt to solve.  By covering these stories, we are not necessarily claiming Bitcoin, crypto or blockchain ""fixes this” (it may well not, given scaling and other challenges). But they disprove the canard that decentralization is “a solution searching for a problem.” As I often say, blockchain may not always be the answer, but it asks the right questions.  In that spirit, I'd like to turn readers' attention to two passages I consider crypto-adjacent in a recent essay by Scott Alexander, the polymath whose return to blogging is one of the highlights of 2021 so far. Inferior writers to whom I will not link have taken sadistic delight in referring to him by the government name he failed terribly at keeping a secret. But he will always be Scott Alexander to me.  Marc Hochstein is CoinDesk's executive editor. The views expressed are his own, so please don't blame his colleagues. This article is excerpted from The Node (formerly Blockchain Bites), CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  For context, the essay's conceit is Alexander offering the U.S. Republican Party unsolicited advice: It should build on Donald Trump’s legacy by emphasizing the class differences between his blue-collar Middle American supporters, who now make up the GOP's base, and the coastal elites who now define the reigning Democrats. One suspects that Alexander is trolling his fellow Biden voters more than the opposition party.  But the mire of object-level politics is not why his essay matters to us. For our purposes, it’s just the MacGuffin.  Free the prediction markets!  The first crypto-adjacent part comes when Alexander proposes a policy agenda that would undermine the power of bogus experts who use fancy university degrees as a justification to lord it over the masses. He writes:  Your solution will be prediction markets. Yes, really. Repeal all bans on prediction markets and give tax breaks for participating in them, until they have the same kind of liquidity as the S&P500. You'll get a decentralized, populist, credentialism-free, market-based alternative to expertise.  Alexander goes on to make it clear that this part of the essay, at least, is not trolling:  I’m serious about this one. ... Prediction markets - an un-biasable, decentralized form of aggregating expert and non-expert opinion correctly - are the only solution I can imagine working.  What makes this crypto-adjacent, you may ask? As CoinDesk’s Ben Powers and Brady Dale wrote last year, prediction markets ""have much in common with those interested in cryptocurrencies and decentralized technology – a distrust of hierarchical systems, a penchant for iconoclastic thinking and the questioning of assumed authorities."" Plus, some fledgling PMs either run on blockchain systems (like Augur) or at crypto exchanges (like FTX).  As far as I can tell, there's no Beltway think tank or trade group lobbying for prediction markets – so it wouldn't be crazy for Coin Center or the Blockchain Association to diversify into this area. Alexander has already written the bare bones of a policy proposal for you!  A Louboutin, stamping on a human face forever  The other salient passage for CoinDesk’s audience comes when Alexander counsels Republicans to lean into their distrust of the mainstream media (which he impishly suggests they refer to as ""upper-class media""). From there it's a quick segue to egging on an ever-more-populist GOP against the big centralized internet platforms:  Insist that working-class people have the right to communicate with each other without interference from upper-class gatekeepers.  What a great line! It makes a delicious retort to the people who not only loathe and avoid forums like Gab or Parler (as is their right, and as Alexander almost certainly does) but go out of their way to prevent anyone else from using them. They do this by pressuring mobile app stores, payment processors or even web infrastructure providers to sever ties with the forums.  Granted, this is not violating anyone’s First Amendment constitutional rights. For all their outsized power, Twitter, Facebook, Google and their ilk have the right to freedom of association, even if they exercise it for the most spineless of reasons, and even if the modern-day Terri Rakoltas badgering them would not extend the same right to devout religious bakeries.  But as Alexander slyly suggests, much of the deplatforming that's happened lately, viewed through the lens of America's ongoing political realignment, is arguably a form of class warfare.  Protecting our democracy from misinformation and hate speech? Nah, dude, you're preventing everyday people from communicating with each other.  Does crypto fix this? Well, platforms like Twetch are trying to use the technology to that end. We shall see. This much is clear: Bitcoin is the only way Gab gets paid, apart from old-fashioned checks.  If Bitcoin is there for Gab today, it’ll be there for Antifa or BLM or Planned Parenthood if any of them needs it the next time the pendulum swings.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Marc Hochstein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/03/03/internet-deplatforming-as-class-warfare,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/88907d4c496b6b7cd30b31dc1d6b04428a93a492-1200x625.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Just two weeks after launch, the fund has become Bitwise's fastest-growing private placement ever, Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan told CoinDesk.      Despite the roadblocks inherent to private securities investment – satisfying accreditation requirements, filings reams of paperwork, wiring money – Hougan said investors are pouring into the DeFi fund at record speed, and ""the pace shows no signs of slowing.""

After all, DeFi protocols attempt to improve and innovate upon classic financial services like lending and trading with a permissionless backend.      But Hougan stressed DeFi's promise readily clicks with the investment mindset:    ""In many cases, it took months of education and discussion for our clients – mostly financial advisors, family offices and hedge funds – to wrap their heads around the core ideas of public blockchains and large-cap crypto assets like bitcoin and ether.

42406007,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAerHxh,1614795457,IRS Says Buying Crypto With Fiat Does Not Trigger Tax Reporting Rules,"The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) said Tuesday it will not require crypto investors who simply bought ""virtual currency with real currency"" in FY2020 to report that transaction on this year's tax returns.      Delivered on the tax collector's crypto FAQ page, the clarification effectively exempts taxpayers who, say, bought bitcoin with dollars, to check the crypto box on their annual 1040. That new question asks: ""At any time during 2020, did you receive, sell, send, exchange, or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?""      The exemption is narrow, however. Investors who swapped one crypto for another, sold their positions or received a token airdrop will still need to check the crypto box under the latest IRS FAQ update.      Taxpayers expressed confusion over whether ""otherwise acquire any financial interest"" in crypto included the act of buying with fiat, said Shehan Chandrasekera, head of tax strategy for CoinTracker. Even IRS officials have told CoinDesk that some of the agency's crypto regulations ""are not ideal.""    Read more: IRS May Make It Harder to Avoid Declaring Crypto on Tax Returns    ""Quite frankly, buying cryptocurrency using [U.S. dollars] is not a taxable event. So, I don't see any reason why taxpayers have to disclose that to the IRS by checking the box,"" Chandrasekera said.      Chandrasekera said the update will likely fail to clarify reporting burdens. For starters, the IRS unveiled its crypto question with little fanfare and has rolled out this new language update largely behind the scenes.      Taxpayers who are not familiar with the FAQ page will almost certainly interpret ""otherwise acquire"" to include buying with fiat, he said, and thus they'll check the box.      He also questioned the logic behind kneecapping what industry experts called a crypto tax cheat dragnet.      ""From just a collection standpoint it doesn't really make sense for the IRS to have this broad question that is, I guess, self-limiting. But then on the privacy standpoint it's much better for the tech privacy-focused taxpayers, that they don't have to divulge information over what is a nontaxable event,"" he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | AIRDROP,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/03/03/irs-says-buying-crypto-with-fiat-does-not-trigger-tax-reporting-rules,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/278f4b4ddc16ef7b295113589ee3451e8b97af77-1206x708.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42406005,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAerHvj,1614795454,The Decoder: ‘Have Fun Staying Poor’,"If you’ve sold your bitcoin too soon, someone on Twitter is going to tell you: ""Have Fun Staying Poor."" It's a phrase often attributed to bitcoin and virtual reality enthusiast Udi Wertheimer (who declined to comment for this article) but it has taken on a life on its own.      So, what exactly does ""have fun staying poor"" mean?    It is a plea for people to reconsider their finances    You’re most likely to encounter the meme as a response to someone that has just sold bitcoin, or has said he or she would never consider buying bitcoin. In this sense, “have fun staying poor” could be uttered as a genuine call to reconsider those decisions.      Read more: ‘It’s Part and Parcel of Crypto’: How Memes Drive Narrative and Value      As Coin Center’s Neeraj Agrawal explained over email, it’s meant to convey “that failure to open one's mind will make you miss opportunities.”      Key to the bitcoin mind is the idea that bitcoin can only go up, while the U.S. dollar (and all other fiat currencies) are destined to collapse. “Have fun staying poor” is shorthand for that idea.    It is a taunt    As Bloomberg columnist Jared Dillian recently experienced, being on the receiving end of the slogan is not always pleasant. After disclosing he sold his bitcoins, Dillian says he heard the four-word phrase for the next three days. “It went a little bit beyond normal Twitter playground trash-talk and crossed over into somewhat frightening territory,” he wrote in Bloomberg Opinion.      Like all other in-groups, the bitcoin community partially forms its identity around what it is not. If “hodling” defines being a bitcoiner, then everyone else necessarily has “paper hands.”    It’s a way to gloat    Over bitcoin’s illustrious 12 years, it has faced no shortage of detractors. Bitcoin’s obituary has been written and rewritten enough times that someone has already written the quintessential story on the “rise and fall” of the “bitcoin is dead” meme.      Add in bitcoin’s meteoric price rise over the past 12 months, rewarding those that have hodled, there might be reason to gloat. After all, bitcoin is certainly not dead.    It is a show of solidarity    In times when bitcoin’s direction is uncertain (nearly always), or even trending downwards, “have fun staying poor” is a way to rally the troops. Investing is a psychologically burdensome activity, even more so with assets as volatile as bitcoin. But the bitcoiner’s investment thesis is simple: buy, hold and forget about it until the world’s base currency is BTC. So in times of choppy waters, a simple call to action is required.    It is often misread    Agrawal notes the meme reverberates with meaning for those ""steeped in the lore."" It's a joke, it's a show of force, it's a life raft tossed to those drowning in the sea of ""melting fiat,"" as MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor is wont to say.      ""But I don't think an outsider, who is most often the recipient of the treatment, sees that nuance. From an optics perspective it's terrible,"" Agrawal said. ""I get what Bitcoiners are trying to do, but I think it hurts more than it helps.""    It is a way to criticize bitcoiners    There are some people who can stomach the abuse of bitcoiners in their mentions. Some may even draw strength from the attacks, secure in their own investment strategies. Take Nick Maggiulli, of the financial blog Of ""Dollars And Data"" and COO for Ritholtz Wealth Management, who sold half his BTC at $52,013 in February.      Maggiulli, a recent adopter of bitcoin, claimed a comfortable profit – 5x after taxes, he said. Despite this, he was told to have fun staying poor. As he notes in a recent blog, bitcoin's growth is all just numbers on a screen until you realize gains.      ""I agree that the U.S. dollar is a terrible investment and that printing more money will make the U.S dollar worth less. However, worth less is not the same as worthless. It’s a slight nuance, but it makes a world of difference,"" he wrote.    It is a way to say goodbye    Sometimes you must kill your heroes. In February, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, an idol among bitcoin enthusiasts, announced that bitcoin was overheated and he was selling. “A currency is never supposed to be more volatile than what you buy & sell with it,” he tweeted. “You can't price goods in BTC.”      Read more: Money Reimagined: Memes Mean Money      Taleb further chastised the bitcoin community as “[COVID-19]-denying sociopaths [with] the sophistication of amoebas.” For some, this really stung. Taleb, author of “Antifragile,” had defined key components of the bitcoin philosophy, namely that virtue only emerges through struggle.      “You should read 'Antifragile.' Great book,” Ark Invest analyst Yassine Elmandjra replied. “There is no long-term stability without short-term volatility,” he said, quoting Taleb.      For others, it was enough to say the obvious.

42406009,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAerI0e,1614790800,Blockchain Sleuthing Firm Calls Nigeria 'Focal Point' for Africa's Crypto Scams,"Israel-based blockchain analysis firm Whitestream has released a report uncovering four recent crypto scams originating in Lagos, Nigeria, going on to claim that ""it seems that Lagos is a central focal point in Africa for investor scams of this kind.""      Bitcoin and crypto use has been booming in Nigeria, but the dark side is the rise of scams. Whitestream's report speculates that Nigeria's Central Bank recently doubled down on cryptocurrency restrictions partly due to the rise of such scams.      Whitestream, which serves large institutions such as Israeli Ministry of Defense and global cybersecurity firm VERINT, discovered the scams on the social media platform Instagram. The Instagram accounts are designed to look like they're from America or Europe, but Whitestream was able to track down that they actually originated from Nigeria.      The scams, which target new crypto users, look very close to other widespread cryptocurrency scams. The scammers ask users to send bitcoin directly to them, promising profits, but instead run away with the money.      Facebook did not return a request for comment by press time.    'Fake reality'    The Whitestream report highlights Instagram photos featuring a fake broker living a luxurious lifestyle from her lavish crypto earnings.      The scammers draw in victims over chat, convincing them to send bitcoin, which the scammers will supposedly invest, promising high returns. But instead of investing the bitcoin as promised, they cash out.      They then typically transfer the bitcoin to the Binance exchange to convert it into fiat currency, Whitestream's analysis determined.    Read more: New to Bitcoin? Stay Safe and Avoid These Common Scams    The scammer used a virtual private network (VPN), which allows people to pick an IP address, to make it look like they were from the U.S. But through deeper investigation, including analyzing the Bitcoin blockchain for transactions and detecting the mobile device that was used, Whitestream found the scam originated in Nigeria.  Whitestream tracked down four similar Instagram scams in the fourth quarter of 2020. ""It may be the same entity that is running all of these scams at the same time,"" the report adds.    Instagram's role    Altogether these scams are raking in tens of thousands of dollars' worth of crypto a month, Whitestream determined.      ""The Instagram platform creates fake reality for young investors who are bored during the COVID-19 situation, and they are losing their savings because of these fake, imaginary accounts,"" Levy told CoinDesk.    Read more: ‘Crypto Instagram’ Is Becoming a Thing, Scams and All    Whitestream CEO Itsik Levy argues that Instagram and its parent company, Facebook, have a duty to stop these scams. The accounts have already been flagged as scams – but there's nowhere to turn to get them taken down.      ""The accounts are still active, and the scam is still attracting new people. It makes no sense,"" Levy said.      Scams can’t easily be controlled, but nor can crypto. Cryptocurrency will stick around, the report argues, despite efforts, such as by the Nigeria Central Bank, to stamp it out: ""It is not possible to block people or financial institutions from using digital currencies, as this is a natural global economical evolution.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/03/blockchain-sleuthing-firm-calls-nigeria-focal-point-for-africas-crypto-scams,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0e0ecdae4b924438226a2a46ebbb980b5bc76ed8-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405995,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAerHlt,1614789766,Why Cisco Should Buy Bitcoin,"Cisco’s (CSCO) outstanding shares are currently at 4.23 billion, down from 7.04 billion at the end of September. In 2021, Cisco plans to return at least 50% of its free cash flow back to shareholders in the form of $6 billion in dividends and $6 billion to $10 billion in stock buybacks.      The company has $10 billion remaining on its authorized buybacks, while another $6 billion is spent on research and development. However, Cisco’s revenue growth is anemic, so one has to wonder about the value of this spend.    Dan Weiskopf is co-portfolio manager of the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF and member of the Investment Committee at Toroso Investments, an exchange-traded fund asset manager with AUM of $5.4 billion as of Dec. 31, 2020.    As a leading company in the networking space, Cisco’s management needs to take risks and demonstrate it is prepared to embrace disruption. Its $30 billion in cash could be used to reduce the share count further and increase the per share free cash flow and earnings per share.      But after reducing the share count by about 3 billion shares since 2000, we can say that this use of capital does not solve the core problem. Cisco’s roots go back to the internet-of-things and its early success came from being at the core of connecting the globe through the internet. As the value of bitcoin reflects trends in blockchain, this should be at the core of Cisco’s future and should be at the core of the company’s ecosystem today.      Why?    Lead with technology    Technologists or futurists want to work where new, exciting things are invented. Let’s face it: high IQ minds enjoy the challenge of learning from each other. Cisco used to be a company that took risks and thrived on pushing the envelope on what could be done.      Cisco’s venture capital portfolio reflected this concept and at times represented $13 billion on its balance sheet. It was also a constant source of innovation and inspiration. Remember the $3.2 billion WebEx deal that was going to connect all people virtually? Oops: That became Zoom, which is worth $126 billion today.    Cisco used to be a company that took risks and thrived on pushing the envelope on what could be done.    Holding bitcoin for employees can be also about messaging. Look at what Michael Saylor has done with MicroStrategy. Bitcoin ownership by the company is run separately from software solutions and therefore it is about capital appreciation, diversification and, yes, inspiration. Remember: MicroStrategy’s mission is to make “every enterprise a more intelligent enterprise.”      Keeping the two separate as businesses means both corporate assets stand on their own merit. But they can still find synergies independently in the blockchain ecosystem.    Customers care    Customers in the emerging markets and Asia use bitcoin as a means to transact. We do not expect large U.S. companies to pay Cisco in bitcoin, but offering the option of doing so demonstrates Cisco is not limited by U.S. standards and embraces the change that is ubiquitous in the emerging markets and Asia. Companies abroad are looking for brands like Cisco and IBM to show leadership. Payment in bitcoin could even be accretive to the bottom line.      Cisco would not necessarily have to hold the bitcoin beyond a certain portfolio value. When payments are made, it could sell it and book a gain or a loss similar to currencies. Note that the futures markets are arguably developing into a deep enough market that hedging is possible in the case of such transactions. Cisco could limit bitcoin payments to between $50 to $100 million initially and easily accomplish hedging, especially given Cisco’s gross margins.    See also: Bitcoin + Ether: An Investor’s Perspective  Technology investors look for growth    Most investors in technology companies want risk and growth. They don’t want technology firms run by management teams who think of themselves as running banks or dividend growth stories. This is why Cisco did not pay a dividend at all for years.      Today, the stability of the dividend is clear and comforting for a certain type of investor, but to say the best use of capital is a continuation of the buyback while growth is not evident sends a message of defensiveness rather than confidence in the future.      See also: MicroStrategy Bets Another $1B on Bitcoin      A new, invigorated Cisco would excite and earn the confidence of investors willing to pay more in the form of a higher multiple. In 2012, Cisco’s free cash flow multiple was at its cheapest point at about 4.8x and today it is north of 11.5x. I understand that reducing the share count to increase the amount of the ownership of a company by its shareholders is tax efficient, but how does this help the company grow, innovate and lead in its industry?    Acquisitions better than BTC    Are there other companies for Cisco to buy in different verticals that make more sense than bitcoin? Maybe! Of course, that would require the company to take integration risk and shake things up. Should such an acquisition be aligned with the blockchain? Yes! We all agree blockchain will be a growth engine for technology. If that is true – and a blockchain acquisition makes sense – what should the follow-on value of bitcoin or even ethereum be as a result? However, why is an investment in bitcoin considered to be a diversifier rather than an investment in Cisco stock by the company? Isn’t diversification designed to lower risk?      I was a shareholder when Roger Biscay, Cisco’s current corporate treasurer and head of Global Corporate Security, joined the company in 1999. I know the pain of poor risk controls. At the time, Barron’s predicted Cisco was going to be the first company to reach a trillion-dollar market value. Clearly, it failed in this ambition so a change is necessary.    To say that the best use of capital is a continuation of the buyback, while growth is not evident, sends a message of defensiveness.    I do know that Scott Herren, the CFO, only joined the firm in December and CEO Chuck Robbins took over in 2017. My point is that something needs to change. The plan to buy back the company stock over the coming 10 years is not a strategy that enhances shareholder value any more than a plan to shrink and not innovate.      If Cisco continues to spend $6 billion in R&D, $6 billion in dividends and $6 billion in buybacks, it could still buy $2 billion to $4 billion in bitcoin. To spend $10 billion on buybacks only follows the path of reducing the share count for the benefit of value investors, who are a narrow section of the buyers in the stock market. Respectfully, I think value investing makes sense.      However, it must be followed by innovation to be really successful. A value investment that grows to become a growth investment is a recipe for a doubling in price. After spending hundreds of billions of shareholder money shrinking the float by three billion shares, management does not seem to be preparing the company for the future and is failing to take proper risk.

Aurum Capital Ventures U.S.A. (ACVU) claims it had previously agreed with Markus Schneider, landlord of its premises in Calgary, N.Y., to let him use its 600 Bitmain S9 mining machines in May 2020 at a time when it was planning to power some of them down.      The landlord allegedly agreed to waiving certain fees pertaining to surplus electricity usage in the premises in return.      According to Aurum, Schneider expressed an interest in purchasing the mining equipment, negotiations for which carried on after the lease agreement came to an end the following November.      Into the New Year, negotiations for a renewal had not come to fruition, resulting in Aurum giving notice of its intention to collect the equipment from the premises.

42406008,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAerHzf,1614783600,"Enjin to Tackle Soaring Gas Fees, Scaling With New Blockchain Products","Against the backdrop of soaring ""gas"" fees on the Ethereum network, blockchain platform Enjin is looking to tackle issues of scaling and interoperability.      According to a press release shared with CoinDesk on Wednesday, the platform will be releasing two new offerings it claims will redefine the non-fungible token (NFT) market.      Dubbed JumpNet and Efinity, the company says its two blockchain solutions will increase support for NFTs while removing Ethereum's expensive gas fees from the equation altogether.      Gas refers to the Ethereum's fee required to execute transactions on the network. The rising costs have prompted other networks to seek alternatives or create their own solutions. According to data from Glassnode, the average price of gas paid per transaction on the Ethereum network has risen roughly 16.5 times over a year from 10.6 in March 3, 2020, to around 175 today.      This has the potential to cause major headaches for a company like Enjin with developers building apps and games under a ""freemium"" monetization model.    Building bridges    JumpNet is an interoperable bridging network that will operate under a proof-of-authority (PoA) consensus mechanism. A PoA mechanismrefers to a solely permissioned setting on a private blockchain where only invited parties can participate as nodes.      The bridging network will be rolled out in two phases, with the first enabling users to move their Enjin Coins (ENJ) from the Ethereum network to JumpNet. By transferring the tokens onto JumpNet’s bridging smart contracts, users will be able to lock up their tokens on Ethereum and then unlock a corresponding amount of tokens on the other side.      From there, users will be able to mint NFTs using the Enjin-developed ERC-1155 standard without the gas usually required. Users can then send and receive those tokens via Enjin’s native wallet or trade them on its NFT marketplace.      “Under phase two, we will enable seamless bridging between Ethereum and JumpNet for ENJ and all ERC-1155 tokens,” said Simon Kertonegoro, vice-president of Developer Success via Telegram. “This will allow our users to choose if they want free transactions on JumpNet or trustlessness on Ethereum and Efinity.”    To Efinity and beyond    Meanwhile, Efinity, which is still currently in development, is expected to become Enjin’s public blockchain.      Enjin says the move provides an opportunity for creators on Efinity to mint multi-chain tokens and move them to other compatible blockchains.      The project also aims to enable users of different blockchains to move their tokens on to Efinity using trustless bridging smart contracts.      See also: Enjin Coin Becomes First Gaming Cryptocurrency Whitelisted for Use in Japan      “These technologies will enable developers to reach mainstream users and provide modern experiences without worrying about unpredictable business overhead caused by gas fees,” said Enjin CTO Witek Radomski.

Its hard supply limit in the face of unprecedented money supply increase is encouraging traditional fund managers to allocate funds to a bitcoin portfolio position, and corporations to hold it as a reserve asset.      But what about ether? Could the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain hold a similar position?    We know that institutional investor interest in ETH is increasing. The Grayscale ETHE trust had growth of over 40%https://grayscale.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Q4-Grayscale%C2%AE-Digital-Asset-Investment-Report.pdf of its almost $800 million 2020 inflows come in the fourth quarter alone. (Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.) A number of ETH investment products have come to market over the past few months, including several exchange-traded funds in Canada. And on Feb. 8, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which caters primarily to institutional investors, listened to increasing client demand and launched ETH futures.    See also: Crypto Long & Short: How Coinbase Going Public Is Reshaping Trust in Markets      This growing interest can be seen in ETH’s recent performance. Whether looked at for the year to date or over 12 months, ETH has significantly outperformed BTC.      Is that why are investors are becoming increasingly interested in ETH? Or are they seeing it as a cheaper store of value than bitcoin?      A new report from CoinDesk Research looks into the value propositions of bitcoin and ether, as well as the different market structures and on-chain data.      Our report found that while bitcoin is increasingly seen as an emergent store of value, ether is more of a technology play. For this reason, it is a riskier bet, which explains its outperformance.      However, the full story is not quite that simple. Bitcoin is also a technology play, and ether is also a potential store of value asset.      Both assets have considerable potential upside for this reason. Ether and bitcoin could end up being considered one, the other or both. Success does not depend on just one outcome.

42405996,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAerHms,1614780038,"Crypto Wallet Exodus Seeks SEC Permission to Tokenize Shares, Aims for $75M Raise","Cryptocurrency wallet Exodus has applied for permission from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to carry out a public offering of tokenized shares in the company.      Exodus announced Wednesday it filed its offering circular with the regulator, and upon approval will carry out a Regulation A Tier 2 offering (often called a Reg A+). By way of this novel equity token tied to shares in the company, Exodus hopes to raise some $75 million, tapping the million or so active users of its wallet.      The filing was made last Friday and the SEC will take at least 21 days to give it the stamp of approval, Exodus said. If approved, the wallet firm joins only a select few in the crypto ranks to go the regulated route, chief among them Blockstack and its $28 million raise in September 2019.      “We've been working on this submission for a long time, with the whole process of back and forth, back and forth,” Exodus CEO and co-founder JP Richardson said in an interview. “Obviously, it still needs to be approved and I can't speak to any certainties here. I can tell you how excited I am.”      Initial coin offerings (ICOs) were all the rage back in 2017, with many blockchain firms selling tokens over the garden fence to an eager audience of accredited (and, in some cases, credulous) investors.      Exodus says it wants to allow the average Joe to become an investor in the firm and owner of its equity via a regulated token offering. Most ICO raises that chose a regulated route did so via a Reg D exemption from the SEC, which means offering to only accredited investors, generally with over $100,000 in spare capital. Only a handful of blockchain companies chose the retail-friendly Reg A+ approach.    Exodus prep    Exodus began working in earnest on preparing a submission for the SEC back in May 2020, Richardson said. He estimated the cost of the process had come in at around $1 million. To get to the filing stage, Exodus enlisted the help of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati (WSGR), the same law firm Blockstack used to handle its Reg A+.      The Exodus offering will allow the firm to sell equity tokens for $27.42 a peice (the minimum investment is $27.42). The sale will all happen inside the app and be confined to bitcoin, ether and USDC. It’s worth noting that the $50 million limit for a Reg A+ changes to $75 million on March 15.    Read more: Blockstack’s Regulated Token Offerings Raise $23 Million    Exodus investors must first complete a know-your-customer (KYC) check with Securitize, a firm that specializes in security tokens.

42406011,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAerI1d,1614774600,Valid Points: What Coinbase's Public Listing Means for Eth 2.0,"There’s a lot riding on the success of Ethereum 2.0, including the crypto-industry’s largest U.S.-based exchange going public.      Last week, Coinbase released its S-1 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In it, the exchange listed potential adverse factors against its business, such as the doxxing of pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, negative perceptions of cryptocurrencies and the growth of cryto-native finance platforms generally referred to as decentralized finance (DeFi).      A failure or slowdown in “the development and launch timeline of Ethereum 2.0, including the potential migration of Ethereum to a proof-of-stake model” was also listed as a possible negative factor for the exchange going forward.      Data may make the point even better: Ether made up 15% of volume on Coinbase in 2020, compared to bitcoin’s 44%. Additionally, 13% of all assets stored on Coinbase are ether. By trading and storing ether, you necessarily take on exposure to the Eth 2.0 project in its entirety.    New stakeholders in governance of Eth 2.0    Governance structures for the two largest cryptos by market cap is also a concern to weigh, Coinbase said.      “Informal governance led by Bitcoin and Ethereum’s core [blockchain] developers that lead to revisions to the underlying source code or inactions that prevent network scaling, and which evolve over time largely based on self-determined participation ... may result in new changes or updates that affect their speed, security, usability or value,” the S-1 states.      It’s well known that Ethereum has a more flexible governance structure than Bitcoin. Being more flexible has some benefits, too, including the ability to respond to threats to the network such as high gas fees.      With Coinbase’s direct listing, it's necessary to ask where that social pressure will push the Eth 2.0 project. Eth 2.0’s roadmap has adjusted to investor and developer demands in the past, including the early launch of the Beacon Chain in December. Will Coinbase stock holders be more interested in governance of the underlying asset in which Coinbase has a large stake? How will that change the network’s progression?      The Ethereum community has a lot on the line, too. As of Saturday, there are now over 100,000 validators staking 32 ETH on the network. That’s more than $5 billion worth of assets at time of writing locked up for a project that is still very much in the Research and Development phase.      Yet, given a $100 billion valuation, a time may soon come when activist investors, developers and users butt heads on Eth 2.0 on a larger scale. We’ve seen it before among token projects themselves: Hedge fund manager Arca demanded developer house Gnosis change its business model or pay back users. With the public listing, the teams working on Eth 2.0 could face similar scrutiny. In other words, a Coinbase public listing brings a new group of entrants into Ethereum’s governance ecosystem.    Pulse check: Improving validator performance    If you’re new to Valid Points and the topic of Ethereum 2.0 in general, be sure to check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics to get up to speed about jargon and terminology used throughout this article.      It’s been two weeks since the CoinDesk validator node, dubbed “Zelda,” was activated on Ethereum 2.0. Since Wednesday, Feb. 17, Zelda has earned 0.10 ETH, worth roughly $150.58 at time of writing. Of the 102,000 active validators on Eth 2.0, Zelda ranks #73,164 by income earned, according to block explorer beaconcha.in.      It’s a little disheartening to see Zelda underperform against the large majority of Eth 2.0 validators. After speaking with others who also run their own Eth 2.0 node operations, I’ve learned there are tweaks and adjustments we can try to help improve node performance.      One of them is increasing the number of other peers to which Zelda is connected. Right now, Zelda communicates with about 50 other Eth 2.0 validators. Bumping that number up to 100 or even 150 peers will increase the chances of her receiving and propagating data about the Eth 2.0 network in a timely manner.      Speaking of data, there’s a wealth of information Zelda receives every minute about the consensus of the Ethereum 2.0 network. The one featured below, called the “Finalized Root,” tracks the value of the hash shown as an arbitrary number computed for each block created on the Eth 2.0 network.      This metric should always look crazy and random. It represents the cryptography that is securing Ethereum’s proof-of-stake blockchain. Should these values ever appear to have a discernable pattern or trend, there is reason to believe that someone has cracked the mathematical algorithm, also called a “cryptographic hash function,” securing the network.      The finalized root is one of several new metrics CoinDesk is able to track in real time through running our own Ethereum 2.0 validator. Over the next few weeks, I’ll highlight more abstruse metrics from the CoinDesk Data Dashboard that illustrate the health and activity of the Eth 2.0 network.      After all, the main purpose of the Valid Points project and spinning up the Eth 2.0 node in the first place was never really about maximizing our returns on investment. (Although the more we can earn for charity, the better!) The motivation for Zelda has always been to chronicle the development of Eth 2.0’s evolution by running our own hardware and gaining an unvarnished perspective of the network’s live development.

According to a report from the Lexington Herald on Tuesday, the House budget committee approved House Bill 230, which removes sales tax obligations from electricity purchased for use by cryptocurrency mining businesses.      The bill now moves to the state's upper legislative house for review, joining the Senate's own tax break for cryptocurrency mining operations: Senate Bill 255. Kentucky uses omnibus branch-wide budget bills, known as general appropriation bills, for its legislative process.      See also: Kentucky Bill Seeks to Lure Crypto Miners With Tax Breaks      The bill's fiscal note estimates a cost to the state's General Fund, which collects receipts from the likes of income and property tax, would be from $1 million a year. Still, committee members recognized the move comes as part of Kentucky lawmakers' larger plans to incentivize job creation and spur on industry growth.      The bill's shortcomings, however, were raised by some, who noted that mining facilities consume large amounts of electricity and it is not necessarily a good thing for the state, according to the report.      “Mining for cryptocurrency takes a lot of electricity,” agreed Rep. Steven Rudy (R), the bill's sponsor. ""It is not just a few people sitting in their mom’s basement or in their parents’ basement writing code. This is actually highly sophisticated, highly technical."" But the representative shrugged off concerns from other members such as those posed by Rep. Josie Raymond (D).

The top cryptocurrency by market value was trading near $51,600 at press time, up 6.3% on the day. It's still down from an all-time-high price above $58,000, though it's climbed from a low of $43,000 reached last week, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      ""The correction looks to have ended with a move above $50,000,"" John Ng Pangilinan, managing partner at Singapore-based Signum Capital, told CoinDesk. Securing a foothold above that level is key to the resumption of the broader uptrend and a move toward new record highs, he said.      Bitcoin's latest break above the psychological hurdle looks sustainable because the futures market is in a far healthier state than in mid-February when excess bullish leverage was seen. Further, institutional demand remains strong, as highlighted by the recent outflows from cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Pro.      ""This time it's at $50K with default funding, no overcrowded futures market, spot market parity with futures and high Coinbase premium, coupled with large outflows and institutional interest,"" market analyst Joseph Young tweeted.      The comments were echoed by Matthew Dibb, COO and co-founder of Stack Funds, who said the overall trend remains bullish, adding that a UTC close above $52,100 would pave the way for a move toward new lifetime highs above $58,332.      Also read: Institutions Are Making Bullish Bets on Bitcoin Rallying to $75K by May – Or Even Higher      However, a new record high could remain elusive if the U.S. bond yields resume their recent rally, pushing stock markets lower, he said.      ""From a fundamental perspective, we are still at the mercy of macro markets. Knee-jerk reactions in the bond market and volatile equities may continue to prove 'risk-off' correlations with bitcoin,"" Dibb told CoinDesk. ""We remain extremely bullish but would not be surprised to see further volatility in the short term.""

42386071,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBR3L1,1614758400,Insurance Giant Aon Is Testing the Waters of DeFi,"Insurance broker Aon is dipping a toe into decentralized finance (DeFi).      Announced Wednesday, the world's second-largest insurance intermediary has embarked on a pilot with Nayms, an insurtech platform that allows cryptocurrency holders to provide decentralized insurance cover against losses due to hacks or buggy software.      Also involved in the project are Relm Insurance, a Bermudian insurer that specializes in digital assets, and Teller Finance, an automated matchmaker between investors’ assets and crypto risk liabilities.      “The Nayms platform puts the tool of smart contracts in the hand of regulated underwriters (like Relm) and brokers (like Aon), to open up a new capital source when underwriting crypto risk,” Nayms CEO Dan Roberts said via email. “This could be in either crypto (ETH, BTC) or in fiat (via a stablecoin). Aon is assessing both options as part of longer-term programs.”      The firms did not elaborate on when the pilot might morph into something more like a live product.      Stepping back, the process of bringing together investors whose collateral will be used to insure specialized risks, is not so dissimilar to the way the Lloyd’s of London insurance market operates. Lloyd’s is backed by pools of underwriters, composed of both corporations and private individuals. (These private investors became known as “Lloyd’s names,” which “Nayms” is a play on.)      Decentralized insurance offerings already exist, as with DeFi insurance alternative Nexus Mutual, which created a community-owned asset pool allowing cover for certain crypto industry risks. Nexus recently began expanding its repertoire beyond decentralized exchange and finance.    Read more: Ethereum-Based Nexus Mutual Expands Its Decentralized ‘Insurance’ to Centralized Exchanges    Aon is familiar with the cryptocurrency space, most notably having worked with San Francisco-based exchange Coinbase. For the most part, the policies in which Aon and other brokers like Marsh are involved tend to insure crypto while at rest, held in cold storage and not connected to the internet.      “Aon is committed to embracing technology and is constantly developing its offering for our growing client base in the digital asset space,” Aon’s crypto specialist, Benjamin Peach, said in a statement. “By collaborating with Nayms and Relm to launch this pilot, we are taking the first step to creating a platform for digital asset companies to scale up their cover efficiently and cost effectively as the market continues to expand.”      Roberts of Nayms said the pilot is about creating more cover for the risks associated with DeFi platforms, but also the wider crypto space as well.      “In contrast to other insurance protocols, Nayms is a general marketplace, in the sense that any type of insurance product can be placed,” said Roberts. “This allows us to enable a wide variety of cover that’s needed in digital assets and beyond, instead of, for example, covering smart-contract risk exclusively.”",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/03/insurance-giant-aon-is-testing-the-waters-of-defi,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42386080,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBR3RJ,1614738600,"BC Group, VSAL Join Forces to Serve Institutional Bitcoin Market in Asia","BC Group, the owner of institutional crypto brokerage firm OSL, has partnered with Venture Smart Asia Limited (VSAL), a digital asset fund manager. Both BC Group and VSAL hold licenses from Hong Kong’s financial regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).      Announced Wednesday, the two parties have signed a memorandum of understanding: OSL will provide brokerage services, including trade execution and capital introduction services, for Arrano Capital, VSAL’s blockchain and crypto investing arm.      The collaboration, the first between an SFC-regulated trading firm and a SFC-regulated brokerage, is further evidence of an institutional crypto charge happening in innovation-friendly trading hubs like Hong Kong, Singapore and Switzerland.      VSAL launched a bitcoin tracker fund last summer, which currently has around $30 million in assets under management, according to Arrano Chief Investment Officer Avaneesh Acquilla. An actively managed fund offering exposure to the top 50 crypto tokens will launch imminently, with the first close of funds targeting around $25 million, Acquilla said.      “There's clearly a lot of interest in the Asia region, if you look at how Asia is represented with some of the exchanges, and obviously, the mining presence in China,” Acquilla told CoinDesk in an interview, adding:      “I think it is noticeable that the institutions [in Asia] have been a little bit slower than in North America to start allocating to the space. And so I think there’s potentially quite a good growth story here.”      OSL’s Matt Long told CoinDesk one difference between institutional investors in Asia and their U.S. counterparts is that the latter has more appetite to buy and hold long-term.      “Consistent with Asia's appetite for risk, we can see institutions and Asian family offices doing a little bit more trading around ranges in the underlying assets,” said Long. “As investors become more familiar and comfortable with the asset class, you will probably see portfolios turning over more often than in either the U.S. or Europe.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/03/bc-group-vsal-join-forces-to-serve-institutional-bitcoin-market-in-asia,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a244add903e12f35d20e8fb83542c860033fa668-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
