42398878,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh8YT,1455145145,Bitcoin Classic Publishes Code That Could Double Bitcoin's Block Size,"The first release for an alternative implementation of bitcoin that would double its transaction capacity has been published.  Today, bitcoin users run or rely on versions of Bitcoin Core, the descendent of the original bitcoin software developed by its pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto. Yet the ongoing debate on how to increase capacity has opened the door to other implementations of bitcoin to gain prominence, as previously demonstrated by the rise and subsequent fall of Bitcoin XT.  The release  of Bitcoin Classic, which constitutes a repackaging of the latest Bitcoin Core software with support for bigger blocks, indicates what could perhaps be a new phase in the ongoing debate whether or how to scale the bitcoin network’s transaction capacity. It follows the release of a second beta version last week.  For over a year, members of the bitcoin development community, users and business interests have engaged in a wide and often bitter debate about the block size.  The latest proposal, in the form of Bitcoin Classic, would raise the maximum size of transactions blocks from a 1 megabyte (MB) limit to a cap of 2 MB. If activated, the new software would constitute a split in the bitcoin network, each with its own divergent transaction histories after the point of divergence.  Since it was unveiled last month, Bitcoin Classic has attracted both supporters and detractors who, depending on their point of view, say it represents either the next phase for bitcoin development or a threat to its very existence.  So far, the proposal, which would effectively split the existing history of bitcoin transactions into two (one with 2 MB blocks and one with 1 MB blocks), has garnered significant support from startups working in the bitcoin space, as well as a number of bitcoin miners.  Discussions about the proposal, as well as the broader issue of whether to increase the transaction capacity on the bitcoin network, have raged on social media for weeks. The debate has effectively split bitcoin’s active Reddit community in two, and further debate has taken place on Twitter as well as individual Slack channels dedicated to Core and Classic.  What comes next?  Now that Bitcoin Classic has been released, one question remains: Will it actually be adopted?  Preliminary data suggests that the number of nodes running Bitcoin Classic is on the rise. According to node data site Coin.Dance, there are more than 500 nodes running the software at press time, compared to roughly 4,100 running Bitcoin Core.  Yet for the software to 'activate', the code requires that the last 751 out of 1,000 blocks be mined that support 2 MB blocks. Once that happens, a 28-day period will begin in which node operators and miners would need to replace their software in order to be compatible with Bitcoin Classic once the larger blocks start being processing.  On a conference call today hosted by bitcoin services startup Coinbase, which pledged its support to operate Bitcoin Classic nodes, original Bitcoin Core maintainer Gavin Andresen said that he expects miners that don't immediately support Classic will move quickly to do so as the anticipated support ramps up.  ""Once you get to 75% of miners, the remaining 25% come along very, very quickly,"" he said. ""We’ve done these...not exactly this type of upgrade but we’ve done similar types of upgrades in the past, so we do know what’s likely to happen. And so once miners see that all the other miners are going in a certain direction, they have an incredibly strong incentive to follow.""  Going forward, adoption depends on a majority of node operators and miners taking the step to break away from the existing network. To date, new versions of the bitcoin software have been rolled out via voluntary soft forks.  The Bitcoin Classic team, which counts among its members developers Andresen and Bloq CEO Jeff Garzik, said that it expects to release another version based on Bitcoin Core 0.12 in the next few weeks.  With the release also comes an updated list of developers and contributors. In addition to Andresen and Garzik, developers include Pedro Pinheiro, Tom Zander and Jon Rumion.  Jonathan Toomim, who was listed at the top of the developer list on earlier versions of the Bitcoin Classic site, is now listed as an ""external advisor"" alongside Ledger editor Peter Rizun.  Former Bitcoin Foundation board member Olivier Janssens is listed as a ""facilitator"", and Final Hash CTO Marshall Long is said to be providing support on the mining side, though his name was previously removed from the Bitcoin Classic site.  Debate to continue  Supporters of a block size increase say that a capacity boost is needed in the near-term to make room for more transactions and stave off what they call prohibitively high transaction fees.  Those backing Bitcoin Classic say that competition among implementations of bitcoin is needed in order to spur development and create a greater degree of choice for users.  Opponents say the changes proposed are too fast and too risky, given what they say are lingering questions about how a hard fork – wherein nodes are required to download new software or risk being effectively cut out of the network due to incompatibility – could be successfully conducted.  Questions have also been raised about aspects of the governance system proposed for Bitcoin Classic, the introduction of two functioning blockchains that share years of transaction history and each with its own network of assets, and the exact degree of support from bitcoin miners for Bitcoin Classic versus a broader block size increase, particularly those based in China.  At the same time, there appears to be support among developers in the bitcoin community for some form of capacity increase, including a raising of the block size.  Bitcoin Core developers and supporters have rallied around a proposal called Segregated Witness that changes how signature data is included in transactions. This proposal has its detractors as well, who say that it adds unnecessary complexity to the network.  Overall, the debate has proven to be as acrimonious as it has been divisive. Accusations that Bitcoin Classic essentially constitutes a coup, as well as allegations that Bitcoin Core is acting at the behest of the startup Blockstream, have thus far colored the nature of the debate in recent weeks.  Today’s release is unlikely to change this state of affairs.

42398892,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh8nE,1455135356,IBM Director Declares 'We’re All in on Blockchain',"Global tech giant IBM took its latest step in leveraging its existing brand power to position itself as an enterprise blockchain solutions leader today, appearing at the The Block Chain Conference in San Francisco.  There, IBM’s Global Blockchain Offering Director John Wolpert gave a keynote speech, his half hour talk covering the deficiencies in the approaches being taken by today’s blockchain developers and why he believes a more collaborative approach is needed to bring the tech to market.  The talk follows the news that IBM is participating in the Hyperledger Project, an open-source blockchain initiative being led by The Linux Foundation. Announced in December, the initiative boasts 30 brand-name tech and financial firms such as ABN Amro, CME Group and Red Hat, as well as select blockchain startups, among its ranks.  In his presentation, John Wolpert gave an overview of IBM’s thesis on the technology, labeling blockchain projects such as bitcoin and Ethereum as ""first generation"" versions of a concept that he believes suffer from deficiencies, both in technology and vision, that will hold back their ability to appeal to businesses.  Wolpert told the audience:  ""In this case, we said, we’ve been here before, and while we think these [projects] are awesome, we as a community need to get behind it and make it real.""  The keystone of Wolpert’s vision is that, contrary to the claims of supporters and developers of existing blockchain protocols, the bitcoin blockchain does not function similarly to the Internet.  Rather, he sought to position the ideas championed by bitcoin’s early adopters not as radical, but as misguided given that there are centralizing forces on the Internet. In this light, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICAAN), a non-profit created in 1998 to oversee IP addresses, was a frequent touch point.  “It’s amazing how many smart and genius people are behind bitcoin, but [they] miss some logic here. [You don’t need] to go from trusted to trustless on everything. I think that’s an honest disagreement … The Internet is a permissioned walled garden. Anyone heard of ICAAN? It’s permissive, but it’s permissioned.”  Wolpert framed the goal of the Hyperledger Project as a way to put “all the best ideas”, including those from bitcoin and Ethereum into one solution, a step he suggested is necessary given the needs a widely used transactional protocol would require.  “This ain’t email, this ain’t websites. This is your money, this is everything,” he said.  Trusted source  Wolpert spent much of his speech attempting to correct what he considered the misconception that IBM is not a company that embraces innovation, noting its history supporting the programming language Java and open-source operating system Linux.  “Our method of operations is open, and often to back not our thing,” Wolpert said. “Java was not our thing, [but] we put an army behind it.”  Wolpert went on to emphasize IBM’s expertise in the area of consensus algorithms and distributed computing, noting that some of its team members have been operating in the field for 30 years.  Though he described Ethereum’s developers as “genius”, he also cited firsthand struggles in IBM’s attempts to build projects on top of these versions of blockchain technology due to issues with confidentiality and privacy.  In contrast he sought to position bitcoin as the Napster or BitTorrent for an idea that will evolve to produce products such as Spotify or Netflix. Nonetheless, he praised the project for its ability to popularize blockchain as a conceptual breakthrough in computing.  “Bitcoin has woken them up to this,” he said. “It is disrupting the thinking, and maybe that’s all that’s necessary. I think bitcoin is hugely important if only for that reason.”  Design details  Wolpert hinted at the work of IBM and its peers on the Hyperledger project, which he described with arguably loose language.  ""It has to be immutable and modular,"" he said. ""It can’t be this is the consensus algorithm, this is the token, all of that has to be modular. It has to be scalable. Interledger-ing is important. You have to inter-op between chains and different things.""  Wolpert more successfully conveyed the building blocks that he sees as necessary to building an open-source blockchain platform that is as widely adopted for a variety of use cases as Linux.  He said:  ""You need a fabric that allows for lots of competition on platforms and huge competition on solutions. We need to evolve the Internet to become economically aware and this Internet is not going to be an application, it will be a fabric.""  Key to this development, he said, is bringing many different stakeholders to the table, something he contends the Hyperledger Project has already achieved due to the diversity of participants from both within the existing blockchain community and the many industries the technology touches.  ""We’ve been doing projects on every kind of blockchain. We’ve been doing that for a couple years and now we have a whole unit. We announced [we were working with] the Linux Foundation,"" he said, adding:  ""At that point, we went all in on blockchain.""  Opportunity boomtown  The message that perhaps most resonated from the conversation, however, was the sheer size of the appetite for blockchain solutions among major companies.  When the Linux Foundation announced the Hyperledger Project, Wolpert said, the organization received messages from 2,300 companies requesting to be part of the initiative, an amount that was four times greater than any previous announcement.  This rush to innovate, Wolpert suggests, will mean that traditional financial service providers are going to be compelled to innovate aggressively to survive.  ""A lot of bankers are smart. They’re not going to succeed in every case. But they are going to try to radically improve themselves ahead of the disruption,"" he said.  Given the increasing number of stakeholders represented, however, Wolpert acknowledged that the way forward would perhaps not be clear or easy.  Wolpert concluded:  ""It’s either going to be a holy mess or it’s going to change the world.""

42398880,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh8aR,1455131054,Princeton University Releases First Draft of Bitcoin Textbook,"The first complete draft of an upcoming Princeton University textbook on bitcoin is now available.  Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies takes comprehensive look at the technology behind bitcoin. The free download is the first complete draft of the book, with an official version expected to be published this summer.  Citing its ""conversational style"", co-author Arvind Narayanan, an assistant professor of computer science at Princeton, wrote in an introductory blog post:  ""If you’re looking to truly understand how bitcoin works at a technical level and have a basic familiarity with computer science and programming, this book is for you.""  In addition to Narayanan, the book was authored with Electronic Frontier Foundation technology fellow Joseph Bonneau; University of Maryland computer science PhD student Andrew Miller; Princeton University computer science PhD student Steven Goldfeder; Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering assistant professor Jeremy Clark; and Ed Felten, professor of computer science and public affairs at Princeton who was named as a technology advisor to President Barack Obama last year.  Homework included  The book assumes a basic understanding of computer science, and is aimed at students, software developers, entrepreneurs, and technology hobbyists.  The work addresses a number of questions about bitcoin, focusing on how the technology functions as well as what the future might bring for the network.  Further, the authors examine a number of other aspects of the cryptocurrency, including security, user anonymity, regulation and the types of applications that can be built using bitcoin as a platform.  For those that want to delve even deeper into the technology, the book's chapters also include a series of ""homework questions"". In addition, there are programming assignments with which readers can implement various components of bitcoin using simplified models.  ""After reading this book, you’ll know everything you need to be able to separate fact from fiction when reading claims about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,"" the authors say. ""You’ll have the conceptual foundations you need to engineer secure software that interacts with the bitcoin network. And you’ll be able to integrate ideas from bitcoin into your own projects.""

42398859,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh730,1455127339,Online Retailer Overstock Spent $8 Million on Blockchain Projects in 2015,"Online retailer Overstock.com spent $8m last year on its blockchain-backed securities trading initiative.  In a statement to investors, CEO Patrick Byrne wrote that the firm spent $6m more than originally anticipated on its blockchain research. The firm said in November that it spent $3.2m during the third quarter on the initiative.  The disclosure came with the firm's Q4 2015 results, which were published yesterday after markets closed.  Byrne wrote:  ""OLabs (our growth and innovation group) contributed what we planned with one exception: though I began 2015 intending to spend $2 million working on blockchain applications for the capital markets, I spent $8 million directly (and perhaps >$12 million in the eyes of the Gods of Economics). Would that it had been $20 million.""  Retail applications  Last August  , the firm formally unveiled its blockchain-based securities trading platform, dubbed tø. The platform was used to issue a $5m 'cryptobond' in July.  Notably, Byrne suggested in the notice that Overstock is weighing possible blockchain applications for its online retail business. While few details were offered, the project would involve the trading platform in some capacity.  ""Incidentally, I am exploring a possible synergy between these two wings of our business (retail and our capital markets innovation), but if it does not prove out they will be separated,"" he wrote, adding:  ""Given our comfortable cash position, strong cash flow and consistent profitability, I would describe my approach to this as, 'brisk but not scrambling.'""

42398870,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh7Eo,1455125164,Have We Reached Peak Blockchain Hype?,"Not so long ago, there was an almost constant flow of stories on digital currency's many use cases, its acceptance by notable merchants and its role in dark web payments, but like the tales of Silk Road's rise or the ""Bitcoin Millionaires"", those days seem to have passed.  The industry, as well as those seeking to help it grow, are increasingly interested not in bitcoin's use in payments, but in its underlying technology, the blockchain, a distributed ledger that provides real-time insight into asset ownership in the $5.6bn bitcoin market.  In this light, bitcoin is now perhaps best considered not just as an investment vehicle or currency, but as the longest-running proof of concept for how blockchain-based systems, those that both use its tech and innovate on its concepts, may improve finance.  However, there has been an increasingly enthusiastic discussion about blockchains or distributed ledgers that many industry observers fear is reaching dangerous levels.  Wall Street and its associated media have lined up to tout the technology's potential power to create faster, leaner trading systems. Bank after bank has headed down the path of, firstly, finding that blockchains offer intriguing possibilities, then, secondly, initiating their own research projects or joining consortia to develop proofs of concept en masse.  But in the general positive hubbub of late, there have been a small but growing number of sceptical voices calling out the burgeoning blockchain space and the media for over-hyping the potential of distributed ledger technology.  By doing so, they warn that banks could be falling into the same pattern of overpromising and underdelivering that seems to have stalled digital currency efforts.  Talking 'amazeballs'  Writing in the FT's Alphaville blog, noted blogger on all things financial, Izabella Kaminska recalls that the blockchain conversation was pervasive at Davos this year.  However, in her reporting, she sought to paint such discussion as juvenile and uninformed, writing:  ""On the streets of Davos this year there are only three discussions being had. One: robots are going to take over our jobs. Two: blockchain is amazeballs and three: FinTech is like blockchain amazeballs, but with even more possibilities to control and mould the behaviours of the common man,""  Kaminska is not convinced about the cost benefits of blockchains, however.  It is ""imprudent"" to make that claim, she writes, without there being any real proof of a working private blockchain and ""the nearest candidate, the bitcoin blockchain, encountering ever greater cost and scaling challenges by the day"".  The comments are a reference to the ongoing debates about how to best scale the bitcoin network, up from the three-to-seven transactions it processes a second today.  Further, she points out that all blockchains have thus far been subsidised by funding rounds or speculative investors and eventually those investors will want returns.  ""The jury’s still out on whether they’ll get that,"" she says.  Overstated scope  ""It’s getting out of control,"" says David Birch of Consult Hyperion, who makes a plea for some rationality in the dialogue on distributed ledgers in a new piece for Finextra.  In an article titled ""It's time to take a stand against all the blockchain crap out there"", Birch writes:  ""It seems to me that in a relatively short time the word blockchain has become detached from its technological roots and from its location in the spectrum of shared ledger implementation options to become one of those almost generic chromewash terms, like, 'big data' or 'cloud' (there is no cloud, remember, it’s just somebody else’s computer) to deliver a superficial veneer of futurism.""  As well as a general lack of understanding over the terminology, Birch raises concerns over the utility of blockchains, which are widely touted as being able to disrupt a wide range of industries and potentially to change the world for the better.  While conceding that there is ""no doubt"" that blockchains are an interesting way to implement ""one particular kind of shared ledger"", and the permissionless innovation environment unleashes tremendous creativity, ""it’s a big step from that to ending world hunger"", he says.  Hammers and nails  A trio of authors over at the Open Data Institute (ODI), the UK-based non-profit dedicated to preserving an open tech culture, have come to a similar conclusion.  They recognise in a recent response to the UK government's Chief Scientific Advisor's blockchain report, that blockchains do have potential in building confidence in government services through audibility, and also have a place in the collection and publishing of distributed data. Smart contracts are further singled out for their potential.  However, they suggested that some people may be trying to shoehorn the technology into places where it is not necessarily needed, or in use cases where it is not appropriate or possible for a successful marriage of systems and concepts.  Putting personal data into blockchains could also create significant new privacy issues if misused, they add.  ""New technologies go through a hype cycle,"" they write. ""The challenge near the beginning of that cycle is to identify the uses and applications that will stand the test of time. Like most new technologies, blockchains could cause significant damage if used indiscriminately.""  The ODI team concludes:  ""Blockchain technology is a new tool in our toolbox. We need to use it when it is the right tool for the job at hand.""  Investors unimpressed  R3 research director Tim Swanson has put forth a similar criticism, suggesting that the technology has ""jumped the shark"" in a January slide deck, the phrase a reference to an episode of ""Happy Days"" that is viewed as the point where the series was no longer creatively relevant.  Swanson told CoinDesk that the message of the deck is aimed at the new community working on permissioned blockchain solutions, which he fears may run into the same ""expectations management"" issues as the bitcoin industry has.  ""If we’re responsible in the statements we’re making publicly, we’ll avoid the over-promising, under-delivering of the virtual currency space,"" he said.  Swanson cautioned that those seeking to popularize blockchain tech's use in database management should pass on this caution to their clients.  Should the blockchain space fail in this regard, Swanson worries that the industry could face a funding crunch.  Investors, he said, are already wary of the space given the sky-high funding rounds of the bitcoin industry, and what he characterized as a lack of movement on those deliverables.  He added:  ""If we as an industry don’t have deliverables by the end of this year, you’ll have the goodwill of financial institutions burned and they’ll think twice about joining the industry.""  Blockchain fallacies?  There seems to be little doubt that blockchains will play some part in our future systems, or at least inform the future of database systems.  Major institutions such as Nasdaq and the Australian Securities Exchange are already undertaking blockchain projects that could see real-world usage in the very near future. Other blockchain services like the timestamping of documents and media are already out there as usable apps.  Yet, perhaps the sceptics have a point when they say that the technology is generally yet to prove itself.  For all the talk of disruption, many proofs-of-concept remain stuck in the lab, and it remains to be seen if their expectations can live up to the reality.  Pete Rizzo contributed reporting.

42398873,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh7Dp,1455114972,21 Inc Launches Bitcoin Transaction Fee Prediction App,"21 Inc, maker of the Bitcoin Computer, has launched a free web app that can help bitcoin users determine what level of fee will ensure a transaction is confirmed in a given amount of time.  The new service, which can be found at bitcoinfees.21.co, provides a real-time guide to the fee levels currently being paid on the bitcoin network, along with the estimated delay in blocks and estimated time until confirmation. Fees are set in satoshis per byte, a reference to the smallest denomination of bitcoin.  The launch comes amid a time when transaction levels are increasingly hitting all-time highs, and the community at large has been split on the question of expanding the network's ability to accommodate more transactions per block. To send a bitcoin transaction, users generally must include a transaction fee, which rewards the miners that process transactions and secure the bitcoin blockchain.  For obvious reasons, miners generally prioritise higher fees first, so the larger the fee, the more quickly the transaction will be written to the blockchain and confirmed.  It is not always clear what is the optimum fee level to set, though.  21 Inc said:  ""[E]xactly how large a fee you need to get rapid transaction confirmation can be hard to predict in advance, because everyone else sending a bitcoin transaction at the same time is effectively competing with you for the speed of inclusion into the blockchain.  To counter this issue, the company created the web interface for bitcoin users who are manually sending transactions, providing users with a fair idea of the optimum fee to set for their transaction.  21's fee predictions are based on blockchain data for the last three hours, along with the current pool of unconfirmed transactions (mempool).  ""From the simulations, it can be seen how fast transactions with different fees are likely to be included in the upcoming blocks. The predicted delay shown here is chosen to represent a 90% confidence interval,"" the firm said.  21 stressed that including a fee the app suggests does not guarantee that transactions will end up in the next block, and that the app/API provides a recommendation based on recent performance.

There, Llanos will be charged with establishing partnerships for the blockchain intelligence startup and working with customers at all stages, from initial engagement to onboarding to developing new solutions on top of the platform.  The role ""is a convergence of my passion with an opportunity,"" Llanos said, noting he has been studying data mining and machine learning for transaction monitoring, even helping to build some of these monitoring programs.  The hiring comes at a time when blockchain analytics platforms are gaining momentum, with Barclays partnering with Chainalysis in October and Coinalytics raising a $1.1m seed round in September. In August, Elliptic won ""Security Project of the Year"" after launching a blockchain visualization tool for the bitcoin blockchain.  Currently, Coinalytics is allowing several companies to use and test its API, which parses the bitcoin blockchain for easy querying.  But Llanos said the company is developing machine learning systems to analyze any blockchain as the industry expands to include public, permissioned and private ledgers.  While Coinalytics is focusing on its AML compliance product targeted at any companies processing bitcoin transactions today, it sees its analytics platform used in many verticals, including capital markets, the Internet of Things and law enforcement.  Tested hire  As a former co-founder and compliance officer at remittance provider Unidos Financial Services, Llanos brings significant experience to the role. While Unidos worked only in traditional remittances, Llanos continued to write about bitcoin, emerging as a certified anti-money laundering expert on the subject during his tenure.  As the bitcoin industry started to gain more attention from regulatory agencies, alongside its increased consumer adoption and investor interest, Llanos was pulled to work for the industry.  For a little more than a year and a half, he was the executive vice president of strategic partnerships and chief transparency officer at BitReserve (today, Uphold). He has also advised a number of bitcoin companies, including BitPagos, BitWage and Mexican bitcoin exchange startup, meXBT.  Llanos' most high-profile role, however, was as a risk and compliance expert on the Bitcoin Foundation's regulatory affairs committee, where he was often its spokesperson on the subject.  Fabio Federici, Coinalytics co-founder and CEO, was also keen to stress how Llanos will move the company forward, however, adding:  ""Compliance and risk management will play a major role in fostering the adoption of blockchain technology across a variety of industries.""
