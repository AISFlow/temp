42384894,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlpmb,1602275474,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Tops $11.1K; Ether Traders Like $400 Options,"Bitcoin is making gains Friday while ether options traders on the Deribit exchange love $400 strikes.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $10,050 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 1.4% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $10,834-$11,111  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price is making gains Friday, rising as high as $11,111 on spot exchanges such as Coinbase before settling to $10,050 as of press time.      David Lifchitz, chief investment officer for quant trading firm ExoAlpha, says another rally could occur once the price gets over $11,200, but it could be difficult to hit new 2020 highs – bitcoin’s record this year was $12,483 on Aug. 18. “The first hurdle for bitcoin lies around $11,200, the lows before the Sept. 3 drop, then $12,000 and $12,500 before trying to retake the previous highs,” he said. “So there's still a long way to go.”      The last time bitcoin hit Friday’s $11,111 price level was back on Sept. 19. This recent run-up has been helped by exuberant market-related news, Lifchitz added. “Bitcoin was looking for a catalyst and partly found it Thursday when Square announced [it] bought ... $50 million worth of bitcoin, and today when President Trump tweeted that a [COVID-19] relief financial package was back on track,” Lifchitz said.      Read More: Bitcoin Must Now Beat $11.2K for Bull Revival, Say Analysts      Indeed, positive news, combined with short-oriented trader liquidations in the derivatives market, have helped push bitcoin higher. Over the past day, over $20 million in buy liquidations dominated the much-maligned BitMEX exchange, versus a paltry $1 million in long wipeouts, the equivalent of a margin call in the cryptocurrency world.      Constantin Kogan, a partner at crypto fund of funds BitBull Capital, notes spot volumes have been picking up, which could provide fuel for a further price upswing. “The spot market is very active,” he said. “From here we could see a potential bullish rise up to $13,000.” Volumes on major spot exchanges Thursday hit $371 million, much higher than the $277 million daily average over the past month. So far Friday, spot volumes are at $288 million.      “I’m happy to see bitcoin break $11,000,” said Henrik Kugelberg, a Sweden-based over-the-counter trader. Kugelberg said many traders will swap poorly performing alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, for more bitcoin, but that trend won’t send price skyrocketing. “I do have some hope it may lie around $10,500-$11,500 during Q4 as more money will move from altcoins to bitcoin – bullish, but no bull run this year I would say.”    Ether option traders prefer $400 strikes    Ether (ETH) was up Friday trading around $364 and climbing 3.4% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Opinion - Ethereum Is Manhattan and Everyone Is Moving to the Suburbs      Ether options traders on Deribit, one of the largest crypto venues in terms of daily volume, prefer betting at the $400 price point. According to Deribit data aggregated from Genesis Volility, options traders currently have over 75,741 ETH options on a $400 strike price, tops on the exchange. This is followed by 71,989 ETH on a $200 strike in second place, followed by 65,159 ETH on the $280 price point.      Greg Magadini, chief executive officer of Genesis Volatility, says the options market has seen a lot of $400 calls lately. “The $400 price point has become an inflection point for ETH recently,” he told CoinDesk.      Conversely, Magadini sees lots of puts on $200, although that price level hasn’t been touched on the ether spot market since way back in May. He added that “$200 is less logical as $250 is a more tested level, but for whatever reason the market likes being short $200 puts more.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly green Friday.

42384908,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlpa1,1602267044,"Yearn.Finance's Creator Says He's Quit DeFi, but Project Has Bench Strength","Yearn.Finance is managing a leadership transition right now and appears to be doing so effectively.      Andre Cronje, the prolific coder and creator of Yearn, said he's quit the project – and decentralized finance (DeFi) altogether – out of frustration with its realities.      ""I'm not building anything at all anymore,"" he told CoinDesk over Telegram on Oct. 1. ""I do it because I'm passionate, but if people are going to use my test environments, then lose money, and then hold me liable, it means there is 0 upside and only risk for me.""      Yearn.Finance is the leading robo-adviser for yield in DeFi and the progenitor of the ""fair launch"" concept that has proved so powerful this summer. However, when users piled into a smart contract he was building in late September that wasn't ready, got hit by an exploit and then blamed Cronje, that proved too much for the developer.      This is a complicated piece of news for a reporter to share. Cronje told CoinDesk of his decision over Telegram on Oct. 1, but then asked us not to report it. This falls outside of the typical protocol for reporters and sources (""off the record"" has to be stipulated up front), and yet we also appreciate that Cronje felt himself under enormous stress. Thus, we held off reporting.      So we've sat on the news, in something of a dilemma, because we were struggling to balance respect for his wishes and the public interest in knowing whether a revered creator is still around. Word has begun to trickle out about Cronje's move, however (including denials from others involved in Yearn), and the community has begun to sense his absence. It is no longer in the public interest to withhold this information.      While Yearn is clearly not directly comparable to Bitcoin, we think of this as something like the moment in 2010 when Satoshi Nakamoto moved on. Had CoinDesk existed then, we certainly would have treated that as news.      But it's also worth noting Bitcoin has persisted and thrived since then and, judging from the robustness of the Yearn community, it has a shot at longevity.      One investor who has been very long Yearn told CoinDesk the project would be able to handle such a transition.      ""Yearn's strongest asset is its incredible community that has coalesced in a short period of time,"" Spencer Noon, of DTC Capital, told CoinDesk over Signal. ""I'm extremely confident the project will continue to thrive, even if for some reason Andre decided to depart the project.""      As Cronje explained, thanks to the fee built within Yearn, which replenishes the token treasury, the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) has funding now to support a staff that can carry on his work.      ""Now the YFI team has to take it over,"" he wrote. ""I mean, they have ~20+ full-time employed and very well paid people.""      Cronje told CoinDesk he deployed all the code that runs DeFi's favorite portal, Yearn. He's become somewhat legendary in crypto, creating Yearn's governance token, YFI, which has been valued as high as $43,000 and is currently worth nearly 2 BTC.      In early September, the official Yearn.Finance Twitter account shared some members of that core team:    Transition    Cronje has gone silent on social media, and the Yearn community has taken notice.      For example, a Yearn user who goes by the handle Niffler started a thread called ""Love Letters for Andre"" in the Yearn governance channel.      ""We love and miss Andre,” Niffler wrote. “But it seems the most vocal individuals recently are the EMN degens that have taken things too far and sprayed some serious hate at Andre. Let’s let him know how much we love him and still appreciate him.""      (EMN is the token for Eminence, the project Cronje had undertaken that went awry; “degens” is crypto slang for “degenerates.”)      Among the 47 posts on that page, another user, whenmoon, wrote, tellingly, ""I saw your Eminence tweet that morning and thought to myself … I don’t know what it is but I want to be involved. ... the excitement and willingness to rush in is a testament to how much people believe in you and your ability to create cool things.""      Cronje told CoinDesk on Oct. 1 that he had informed the staff he was leaving some time ago, but he was clearly frustrated by something that had happened in the previous 24 hours. While he was building a smart contract for the Yearn community called Eminence.Finance, users found the contract and began sending funds to it, despite no one but Cronje knowing what it was.      That tells you how much of a rock star he was in the community. But Cronje was nonplussed.      He told CoinDesk he did not anticipate the DeFi community would ""put ~15m into [his smart contract] without any announcements, documentation, website or understanding [of] how it works.""      Previously, Cronje had been quite excited about the next phase of his project.      His decision to quit DeFi following the hack runs counter to an announcement he made on Sept. 29, saying he would continue working on the new project:      Following the hack, he said he's been getting threats from those who blamed him for an attack on code he hadn't declared live.      It was possible for Ethereum users to send funds to his smart contract because he worked on it on the Ethereum mainnet. In fact, Cronje's Twitter bio has always been: ""I test in prod"" (meaning production, that is, a live environment accessible to the public).      Cronje was astonished that people would be so rash as to send money to a smart contract before he had declared it ready. The fact they did is indicative of how maniacal some retail investors have become about seeking yield.      Reached by CoinDesk over Telegram Thursday, Cronje did not change any of his previous statements, saying he was focusing on his own best interests right now.      POSTSCRIPT (Oct. 9, 19:10 UTC): Shortly after this article was published, Cronje sent a tweet denying he had quit, contradicting what he had told CoinDesk on Oct. 1 and again Thursday.

From creating digital Social Security Number alternatives to building e-commerce tracing systems, the winners have up to six months to develop blockchain proofs-of-concepts for DHS' client agencies. S&T's Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP), essentially an equity-free tech accelerator within S&T, is funding the round.    Spherity GmbH received $145,000 to develop a ""digital twin"" record of inbound e-commerce packages. The German company's system would share critical information among parties without compromising privacy, SVIP said. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the client.  New Zealand-based MATTR LIMITED will build U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services a digitally issued essential worker license using its $200,000 prize. S&T officials said COVID-19's work shutdowns have proven the need for distributed, verifiable digital credentialing systems that get essential staff back to work.  Mesur.IO will retrofit its Earthstream environmental analytics platform for CBP's food-tracing efforts. With $193,612, the North Carolina firm plans to identify and track toxins, pathogens and other undesirables across the supply chain.  SVIP veteran SecureKey Technologies has now won an additional $193,000 to create a digital alternative to the Social Security Number that gives its holder full informational control. DHS is already under departmental order to phase out the highly insecure SSN, and Toronto-based SecureKey could play a part in that.  Mavennet Systems, also an SVIP regular, this time won $86,100 to digitally trace natural gas shipments between the U.S. and Canada, its home country. CBP said it aims to use Mavennet's Neoflow platform to give regulators a better look inside cross border gas exchanges in accordance with the USMCA trade agreement.

42384893,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlpk5,1602259397,Blockchain Bites: Bitcoin Crosses $11K While DOJ Takes Aim at Crypto,"Ethereum’s success drives imitation.      Just take a look at the latest report from the crypto-industry publication DappRadar: In the third quarter of 2020, Ethereum accounted for 96% of the total transaction volume over decentralized applications, including the blockchain-based trading and lending networks that have exploded in popularity in recent months.      Prices for ether (ETH), the Ethereum blockchain’s native token, have nearly tripled in 2020 to about $350. Such returns make better-known bitcoin’s 52% year-to-date gain look paltry.    CoinDesk is preparing for the invest: ethereum economy virtual event on Oct. 14 with a special series of newsletters focused on Ethereum's past, present and future. Every day until the event the team behind Blockchain Bites will dive into an aspect of Ethereum that excites or confuses us. Today's introduction was written by markets editor Bradley Keoun.    But success has brought a slew of problems, such as network congestion that has slowed down transaction processing and pushed up average fee rates to record levels.      Ethereum’s 2.0 upgrade is supposed to boost processing speeds to 1,000 to 4,000 transactions per second, but for now the grumbling abounds. “Scalability has been a critical issue for Ethereum,” the analysis firm IntoTheBlock noted this week in a blog post.      All this creates an opening for competitors that are nowhere near ready to concede Ethereum’s first-mover advantage as the dominant smart-contract blockchain.      The list of challengers isn’t short. In no particular order, there’s Tron, EOS, Neo, Polkadot, Algorand, Cardano and Avalanche, among others. According to the data firm Messari, no fewer than 17 of these blockchains have tokens that trade, with market values of at least $100 million each.      Over the past year, Zilliqa’s ZIL token has returned the most, gaining 73% versus ETH. On the other end of the spectrum, EOS’ EOS tokens are down 56% in ether terms.      Some rivals aren’t looking to take on Ethereum per se, but are keen on stealing lucrative parts of the franchise.      Radix DLT says it’s one such firm – a blockchain built with the express purpose of becoming a home for the fast-growing cryptocurrency subsector of decentralized finance (DeFi).      CEO Piers Ridyard told CoinDesk in an interview this week that Ethereum’s one-size-fits-all model probably doesn’t cut the unique technical requirements of DeFi, and that’s crucial if operators are going to scale their platforms to the point where they could plausibly start to challenge big banks and Wall Street trading firms.      Ridyard is scheduled to appear on a virtual panel on Thursday, Oct. 14, at CoinDesk’s invest: ethereum economy conference, alongside Roham Gharegozlou of Dapper Labs. CoinDesk tech reporter Will Foxley is hosting. It’s at 5 p.m. Eastern time.      Ridyard said he’s not worried about Ethereum breaking away. The industry still has a long way to evolve, and there’s plenty of time to catch up or overtake the market leader.      “Technology moves at a breakneck speed and mind-numbingly slow pace at the same time,” Ridyard said. “Fundamentally we are still in the concrete-pouring phase of the industry.”    Featured panel    The Fees Are Too Damn High: DeFi Pushes Ethereum to Its Limit Ethereum has delivered many mind-boggling innovations – some by design, others out of necessity. With DeFi pushing the ecosystem, existing infrastructure is being maxed out. Can Ethereum 2.0 address these pain points? Is this the opportunity for so-called ""Eth Killers""? We assess this critical fork in the road as Ethereum looks to level up.

A phenomenon that hardly existed at the beginning of this year has pushed the total value locked in bitcoin past $1.3 billion.      On Oct. 12, CoinDesk markets reporter Zack Voell discusses the yield farming phenomenon with Matt Luongo of Thesis, Jeff Garzik of Bloq, Loong Wang of Ren Project and Kiarash Mosayeri of BitGo.      Watch Bitcoin's $1 Billion Crop: Why Hodlers Are Harvesting Yield on Ethereum on Oct. 12, streaming on CoinDesk.com, Twitter and YouTube.    Ethereum 101    Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are the latest decentralized tools to send the Ethereum economy into warp speed. NFTs are ways to append real-world or digital objects to a blockchain, usually Ethereum.      First brought to public consciousness in 2017 with the success of CryptoKitties, the sector is still largely focused on the goofy and surreal – there’s a booming art world, gaming sector and now even a place to itch your NSFW desires.      Brady Dale was the first to break down why and how NFTs got roped into the decentralized finance craze.    NFTs meet DeFi    NFTs have not captivated investor attention until quite recently because lending, borrowing and risk management – what we now call DeFi – have taken up all Ethereum’s oxygen in 2020. So Ethereans largely lost interest in NFTs there for a while – and who could blame them? You could buy them and sell them, and sometimes games would come together, but they seldom held players’ attention for very long. There were more dynamic markets to game; art’s fine but money is money.      Even when there had been buzz, some projects would rise up only to fade away, revealing a weakness in the NFT specification. CryptoStrikers, for example, a sports memorabilia project launched during the World Cup is long gone (soccer-focused Sorare has emerged in its wake).      Why is the marriage of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) happening now? It’s debatable but you can make an argument that it comes back to DeFi’s favorite robo-advisor for yield: Yearn.Finance.      When the DeFi gateway created Y.Insure, a way to do KYC-free insurance on any crypto asset, it used NFTs to represent the policy with insurers. So, once reminded of ERC-721’s existence by DeFi’s top Chad, the industry ran with it.      That’s the short story, the long story involves the financialization of these tradable assets.      Financialization As much as people like owning expensive stuff in crypto, they like owning stuff they can sell whenever they want even more (call it a liquidity fetish). NFTs had managed to be expensive but they had not managed to be liquid, not until DeFi-thinking intervened.      The stranger products are emergent phenomena of that financialization. Brukhman gave the example of Ark Gallery, which is a DAO for CryptoPunks. The punks were made pre-ERC-721 and have become quite valuable as early, cool and rare (there are only 10,000 such punks, each completely distinct). Ark allows people to crowdfund a punk (owning a fraction of the token) and then voting on whether or not to sell it if there’s an offer.      If there is a successful offer, everyone gets a proportionate share of the payment, based on how much they own. This has made CryptoPunks trade at ever-higher prices, allowing more people to feel like they had a piece of one. It’s clear that the spikes in volume have gone much higher this year when viewed on NFT data site NonFungible.com.      NIFTEX has taken that even further. Launched early this year with funding from Digital Currency Group (CoinDesk’s parent company), NIFTEX started off creating indices for NFTs, such as digital real estate or digital cards. But the real innovation kicked off when the firm fractionalized expensive NFTs into what it calls shards (really, just ERC-20 tokens – fungible slivers of previously singular digital assets).      The shard system works somewhat like what Ark Gallery does, except only someone who holds one of the ERC-20 tokens that represents partial ownership of an item can make an offer. The offer automatically succeeds if it fails to receive enough objections in two weeks, with a clever strategy built in to punish low-ball bids.      NIFTEX did its first fractionalization in May and, like Ark, the firm is seeing a lot more liquidity. Shard holders own a fractionalized, extremely rare Axie Infinity card called Almace that saw over 1,000 ETH transacted in its first week after sharding. Joel Hubert, one of the two co-founders, estimated its liquidity all year would have been more like 300 or 400 ETH in a few trades, without sharding.      On NonFungible, Axie Infinity shows appreciably more dollars getting transacted even if the volumes are only bumped up slightly.      “I like where we’re at because Ethereum is all about experimentation,” Hubert said.      The larger point to all of this is that content is finding a path to fair remuneration on the internet.      Added Flamingo’s Desai, “When you start talking about how content creators are paid, that’s where DeFi comes in; and when you start talking about property of creators, that’s all NFTs.”    The ledger    While NFTs are usually written off as merely game pieces, like all decentralized technologies they have the power to bring financial services to the un- or underbanked. Just as the technology transcends particular blockchains, so too can it move beyond borders.      Leigh Callon Butler, a CoinDesk columnist and director of the consulting firm Emfarsis, wrote about an NFT game Philipinos turned to for making money during the coronavirus shutdown. (This excerpted essay was published first in August.)    Fun and games    In the Philippines, one popular blockchain-based game is even providing pathways out of poverty and helping spread the word about novel technology. Created by Sky Mavis, a Vietnamese startup, Axie Infinity is a decentralized application (dapp) on the Ethereum blockchain where players breed, raise, battle and trade adorable digital critters called Axies.      Ijon Inton, an Axie player from Cabanatuan City, which is about 68 miles north of Manila in the province of Nueva Ecija, first learned about it in February of this year when his friend stumbled across an explainer video on YouTube. Intrigued by the “Play to Earn” element of the game, he decided to give it a go.      “At first I just want to try its legitimacy, and after a week of playing I was amazed with my first income,” said Inton, who is currently earning around 10,000 PHP ($206) per week from playing the game around the clock.      Inton soon invited his family to play, too, and after a few weeks, he also started telling his neighbors. A crypto trader since 2016, Inton helped his friends set up a Coins.ph account so they could buy their first ETH and get started. Now, there are more than 100 people in his local community playing to earn on Axie, including a 66-year-old grandmother.      The COVID-19 crisis, which has confined people to their homes and limited the usual opportunities to earn an income, combined with the compelling nature of the Axie game itself, has encouraged people who might not usually play with dapps to do just that.      “To a crypto investor, gaining $300 or $400 a month might not mean that much, but for these people it means the world,” said Gabby Dizon, the Filipino co-founder of mobile app development company Altitude Games. “It’s food on the table, it’s money for their families and it’s saving them when they cannot even leave the house during this pandemic.”      There are a number of ways to make money with Axies. For new players, the most common method is by earning the utility token, small love potion (SLP), and selling it via a liquidity pool at the decentralized trading platform, Uniswap. Issued as a reward when Axies win battles, SLP is in demand because it’s required to get a couple of Axies in the mood to breed.      Chatting with me via Zoom, Inton explains how earning SLP became his full-time job. Before COVID-19, the plan was to move to Japan and take up a new career as a trainee butcher. This is a common story for many Filipinos. Faced with a lack of job opportunities, they are forced to leave their families and seek employment abroad.      Inton was due to fly out in May. But now, with international travel suspended, he is stranded back home in the province. Behind him, I can see his wife nursing their baby in one arm, and in the other she’s playing one-handed Axie on her mobile phone. Each day they play around 20 hours combined, taking it in shifts.      She does four hours in the afternoon and another six around midnight, while he plays in the morning for eight hours and another two before bed. Together, they can rack up around 1,500 SLP per day, while sharing the caring duties for their three children aged six, four and 18 months. Currently, SLP is trading for under 2 PHP, but on June 8 it went as high as 11 PHP.      For more seasoned players, or those with greater risk appetite, higher returns can be made by trading the Axies themselves. Inton has dabbled in this space, breeding Axies and selling them for as much as 2,000 PHP ($41). Just last week, two very rare Axies were sold for 60 and 90 ETH. The highest price ever fetched for a single Axie currently sits at 110 ETH.      To put this kind of money into perspective: Since the first round of quarantine was enforced on the main island of Luzon, national unemployment has risen to an all-time high at 17.7% (compared to 5.1% a year ago) and GDP shrank 16.5% for the same period.      Further, with more than 100,000 overseas Filipino workers repatriated, the Asian Development Bank has estimated remittance losses somewhere between $31.4 billion and $54.3 billion this year. Last year, remittances made up over 10% of Philippine GDP – acting as a crucial lifeline for poor families, especially during a crisis.    At stake    Back to the theme of Brad Keoun’s introduction: the competition between various smart contract blockchains. Ethereum is certainly the dominant player, but it would be a mistake to see all alternative base layers as vying for the same pie.      Brady Dale covered the run-up to the Ready Layer One conference last spring, which sought to find common ground between the base layers.    Base layers    Togetherness is the message of Ready Layer One, a conference put together by the Web3 Foundation, Near, Cosmos, Tezos, Protocol Labs and Polkadot, all entities involved in building new blockchains designed to serve as the primary layer for distributed applications. Other blockchain projects may yet join.      The website describes the virtual gathering as follows: “Think of it as the intersection between a hackathon, a conference, a MasterClass seminar and a vaguely anarchist festival for developers and builders of a decentralized web.”      Ready Layer One reflects a big-tent approach to blockchain gatherings, not unlike CoinDesk’s own Consensus, which is also going virtual this year. While most gatherings tend to be protocol-specific, Ready Layer One is taking a more agnostic approach.      The event represented a combined effort to galvanize those already in the ecosystem to work on some of their shared problems together. CoinDesk recently reported on the idea of blockchain interoperability as a vision in which there will be “one network, many chains.”      “We think of blockchain technology as a public good to build a more open and innovative world, but it’s unclear yet what technologies and set of trade-offs really works,” Illia Polosukhin, a co-founder of NEAR, said.      Featuring two of the best-known interoperability projects, Cosmos and Polkadot, Ready Layer One reflects a real-world example of at least part of the industry betting that a rising tide will lift all boats.      Chris Ghent, from the marketing team at TQ, an organization working to advance the Tezos blockchain, said, “We don’t need people to commit to one thing but to commit to blockchains [in general].”      The target audience for the event is developers, and there’s no cost to attend. Participants just need to demonstrate some skin in the game either by showing they’ve already done blockchain work or by participating in the testnets, hackathons, staking demonstrations and other open calls issued by the organizing protocols.      Hands on “The founding projects, they all have stuff that’s ready to go,” Zaki Manian, co-founder of a Cosmos-oriented staking company called Iqlusion said. “You can build with it and play with it right now.”      TQ’s Ghent sounded a similar note, saying the pitch really is to draw in what he called “qualified tinkerers.”      “If I want to build something on Cosmos, and Cosmos dies, can I build a similar thing on NEAR?” Manian said by way of example. The answer, he thinks, is yes, and if Ready Layer One can show that to developers, then those devs will see less risk in choosing to build on any of the Layer 1 networks.      There’s also going to be an element of dealing with cross-chain challenges, according to Ashely Tyson, who is helping to organize the event on behalf of the Near protocol.      “There are a few topics that cross all of the protocols that we’re going to be compiling themed workshops and mainstage talks around,” Tyson said. Before the world shut down, Near had been organizing small gatherings to discuss some of these issues, such as standards for using existing open source technology (like WebAssembly) in a blockchain context and efficiently keeping interoperability in mind.      There will be some updates on these topics and also calls for developers to get involved in research and development that should benefit all the projects.      Blockchains have potential but no one disputes that it’s not yet fully realized.      Poloshkin spoke to frustrations that the technology is not really ready to help in the current crisis. “The technologies we are all working on have an ability to help and change things in the coming months and years. But we are still far from the state where it can be used by the mass market,” he said.    Top shelf    Employees walk Coinbase has lost 60 people from its 1,200-person staff after an updated mission statement from CEO Brian Armstrong sparked fierce debate over how companies should respond to today’s charged politics. In a companywide memo obtained by CoinDesk, Armstrong informed employees that 5% of the company’s workforce had accepted the severance package offered last week. The deadline for employees to signal their interest in the package was Wednesday, and Armstrong said he expects the number to be higher after a “handful of other conversations” are completed.      Crypto framework Thursday, U.S. Attorney General William P. Barr announced the release of “Cryptocurrency: An Enforcement Framework,” a roadmap for policing the cryptocurrency landscape. The framework provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging threats and enforcement challenges associated with the increasing prevalence and use of cryptocurrency, Barr said. “Despite its relatively brief existence, this technology already plays a role in many of the most significant criminal and national security threats our nation faces,"" said Associate Deputy Attorney General Sujit Raman, chair of the Cyber-Digital Task Force, which wrote the report.      Bitcoin bites back Bitcoin broke through $11,000 on Friday, reaching its highest price in almost three weeks. The rise comes a day after payments company Square announced it had put 1% of its total assets into the largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The rally to $11,000 marked an upside break from the past two week's range of about $10,500 and $10,800, a range the cryptocurrency held despite news of the KuCoin exchange hack, U.S. regulators bringing criminal and civil charges against BitMEX and President Donald Trump's announcement he would end talks with Democratic lawmakers over a new fiscal stimulus package.      Core CBDC principles A group of seven central banks along with the “central bank for central banks” has released a report setting out the “core principles” for how national digital currencies can help implement monetary policies. Prepared by the central banks of Canada, the U.K., Japan, Sweden and Switzerland, as well as the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the report states CBDCs should work alongside cash and other current payments, support ""wider policy objectives"" and ""do no harm"" to monetary and financial stability, and ""promote"" innovation and efficiency. Meanwhile, the Dutch central bank gave its first approval to a crypto exchange.      Lightning strikes A vulnerability in LND versions 0.10.x and below has been disclosed to the Lightning Labs team, according to engineer Conner Fromknecht in the Lightning Network developer channel Thursday. In light of the disclosure, the firm is urging node operators to upgrade to versions 0.11.0 or higher as soon as possible. No known exploitations of the vulnerability have been found to date, but ""circumstances surrounding the discovery resulted in a compressed disclosure timeline,"" Fromknecht said. The vulnerability was ""partially"" disclosed with a detailed publishing of the findings promised Oct. 20.

42384895,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlplL,1602256196,Money Reimagined: Fixing the Internet's Big Flaw,"The Money Reimagined Podcast    After reading this newsletter, make sure you check out the latest edition of our podcast.      This week, Sheila Warren and I talk to Hyperledger Executive Director Brian Behlendorf about self-sovereign identity, the topic of the column below. A developer whose three-decade career has seen him deeply involved in efforts to foster a more open internet, Brian grasps, like few others, the nuances of how human beings should live within a rapidly changing digital economy.    Getting internet identity right, 30 years on    We tend to think of governments, with the data they collect on births, drivers licenses, tax returns and passports, as humanity’s primary identity managers.      Arguably, internet platforms have usurped that role. Some store more identifying records than China – Facebook has 2.7 billion active users; Google manages 1.5 billion email accounts. Just as important, they can tie those records to our online behavior and gather immense predictive power. Facebook’s algorithm even knows if you are going to break up with your partner – before you do.      This isn’t another Facebook-bashing column. It’s just that its all-knowing power highlights how the fundamental human question of identity has changed in the internet age.      It also illustrates why we need a new “self-sovereign” model of identity to match our digital existence and why the latest moves toward that deserve widespread support.    Flawed from the start    An original sin was committed at the internet’s conception: its underlying, decentralized architecture was built without an identity layer.      The internet’s founders had good intentions. To ensure universal availability, the system controlled access by assigning addresses to computers but was agnostic about the identities of the people, companies and devices using them. As a famous New Yorker cartoon quipped in 1993, “On the internet, nobody knows you’re a dog.”      This became a problem when entrepreneurs started building e-commerce businesses in the 1990s. Users needed to trust the person on the other side of a transaction, which, according to offline practices, meant identifying them to hold them accountable.      So a jury-rigged solution was installed at the internet’s application layer. Certification powers were introduced, allowing web-based companies to gather and verify users’ identifying information. Over time, this gave rise to a new class of immensely powerful gatekeepers.      We ended up with the worst of both worlds. On the one hand, end users still don’t know who’s controlling disinformation bots. On the other, as CoinDesk’s Ben Powers put it in a great contribution to our “Internet 2030” series, the centralized data gatherers “not only know you’re a dog, but also what breed you are, what your favorite kibble is and whether you’ve been microchipped.”      This power asymmetry has fueled a severe deterioration in societal trust, and solutions have been hamstrung by a pre-internet mindset. We’ve placed responsibility for policing behavior with intermediaries, which has further empowered centralized data gatherers.      This contradicts the internet’s decentralized, identity-free base layer, creating unique opportunities for abuse. Web sites accumulate giant honeypots of personal identifying information (PII), which are constantly breached by unidentified hackers.      Meanwhile, even though companies complain about the liability in storing user data, they find it hard to resist surveillance capitalism, the data-exploitation practice that has become the core business model of the internet.      We need a new mindset. Because the internet’s underlying architecture is decentralized, the identity solution must also be decentralized. Control over PII must reside with those to whom it refers – with you and me, in other words. This is the principle behind the “self-sovereign identity” (SSI) movement.    Controlling attributes, not identity    Let’s be clear: This isn’t easy. Identity is an extremely complex concept.      In the metaphysical sense of “who I am,” identity is at once highly personal and completely social. We value a unique selfhood, but it’s meaningless without reference to the society within which that self exists.      It’s also fluid and multilayered. We occupy – or ""perform”– different versions of our identity, or personas, depending on context. We all play a different persona in job interviews than the one we play at home with family.      And in the wider economy, where proofs of identity solve the deep-seated challenge of trust, allowing us to transact, what matters is not our selfhood but the distinct attributes that comprise it. Do you have a degree? A driver’s license? A credit score over 740? These are isolated attributes. They are not our identity per se.      With SSI, sophisticated cryptography allows individuals, as sole custodians of their data, to prove they have the credentials that describe their attributes and selectively reveal them in an encrypted form to service providers.      In an oft-cited example conceived by identity expert David Birch, you could legitimately enter a bar after furnishing a cryptographic proof that answers one question: Are you over the designated drinking age? The bar owner doesn’t need to know all the other information displayed on your driver’s license: not your name, your address, your license number or even your actual birthday.    ID ideation    A host of entities are working on SSI, from big players like IBM and Microsoft to startups such as Gataca and Hyland Credentials. Some governments, including the Canadian province of British Columbia, are supporting special ID apps for their constituents.      Still, standardization across the internet will be critical. An important piece is the decentralized digital identifier, or DID, being developed within the world wide web consortium, or WC3. Groups of tech and finance heavyweights have also formed associations to promote open-source collaboration, including the Digital Identity Foundation and the Trust Over IP Foundation.      Within the standard SSI model, blockchain technology plays an important but minor role currently. Some SSI projects have dabbled in tokenization to raise funds and incentivize stakeholders such as credential providers. But the troubles caused by the Sovrin Foundation’s token sale have quelled enthusiasm for that.      A blockchain is not used for storing identifying data. That’s up to the individual data owner, who could choose to store it on a hard drive, for example, or with a cloud account he or she controls. Rather, a blockchain is used as a public key registry and management system to prove the private keys with which a user enables access to encrypted credentials are associated with the right person or company. In this way, a hospital can decode and validate medical records shared by a patient, while keeping its privacy compliance officer satisfied the patient is indeed authorized to do so.      More important is how SSI could help other blockchain applications. If decentralized finance (DeFi) applications are to spread to traditional finance, for example, there must be a way to identify market participants without inserting a centralized authority into a necessarily decentralized environment.    Human empowerment    The most important use case for SSI lies in protecting our humanity. In an age when data leads to economic domination, shifting control to those who generate it is a really impactful way to empower individuals.      Instead of thinking of digital data as a sinister threat to our privacy, SSI could turn it into an asset sold or used to get credit or obtain other services. Think of people who live without credit cards and can’t generate credit scores but whose trail of internet connections – their so-called web of trust – show a history of fulfilling commitments.      Within an SSI framework, we can use our data to safely connect our identity to the society with which it is intrinsically associated. We could map and measure our social connections, capture that data as an attribute and then communicate it to others so they’ll trust us enough to transact.      Courtesy of COVID-19 and the public interest in contact tracing, there’s now an immediate use case for this kind of controlled measurement of social activity. It’s why Hyperledger Executive Director Brian Behlendorf, appearing in this week’s Money Reimagined podcast, argues the first prominent deployment of SSI would come next year in the form of a “digital yellow card” for vaccination records.      Whether we like it or not, society is digitalized and decentralized. We need an identity system that aligns with that.    DeFi’s Mini and Maxi Bubbles    The “phssssssttttt” sound you hear? It’s the DeFi bubble deflating.      After a stunningly buzzy summer for decentralized finance, when new wild-idea projects were being announced on a daily basis, bringing new speculative money surging into the DeFi ecosystem, the once-soaring prices for those projects’ tokens have fallen sharply and deeply. This chart of DeFi-wide market capitalization over the past six months, produced by CoinDesk’s Shuai Hao, tells the story.      It shouldn’t come as a huge surprise. This had all the hallmarks of a bubble, with some parallels to the initial coin offering (ICO) mania of 2017. (Though there was nowhere near the kind of speculative investment by retail crypto “newbies” that we saw three years ago, partly because this is an inherently more complicated space.)      But I for one think the DeFi bubble contained something very exciting, more so than the ICO bubble, though both are important for reasons that are lost when people dismissively focus on investors’ crazy excesses. (I subscribe to Carlota Perez’s theory of technological revolution, where excessive speculation is treated as a fundamental, unavoidable and even necessary element of how new technology is introduced to society, how it breeds innovation “waves” and “surges.”)      Among the most interesting aspects of it was how DeFi’s composability enabled “lego” innovation, where one new protocol became a building block for a new developer to build their next new innovation on top of it and how that new idea breeds its own new surge of speculation. In the process, an entirely new decentralized financial system is being organically created and incentivized.      That effect plays out if you look underneath the overall market DeFi bubble at the trends shown by individual governance tokens. In this second chart from Shuai, we zero in on the “DeFi summer” that began in mid-June and on two governance tokens in particular, Compound’s COMP and Yearn.Finance’s YFI. You can spot quite separate mini bubbles within the one maxi DeFi bubble. By the end of June, COMP had already peaked, before YFI had even been launched. Both are now down, but the chart shows that the timing of their respective mini-bubbles isn’t very correlated.      Will there be a revival of the DeFi? I think so. Hopefully in a more orderly way, through the long-tail consolidation phase. You can’t stop innovation. And who doesn’t like playing with Legos?    Global town hall    FCA FAIL. Crypto regulators might mean well. But sometimes they can be extremely out of touch with the realities of a market that’s global, nimble and easily enables entirely legal workarounds against the rules those regulators put in place. As commentator Ajit Tripathi points out, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority’s move to ban crypto derivatives seems to be an overzealous effort to save British residents from themselves – a rather pointless one, at that, because it will just drive them into unregulated overseas markets, where they can harm themselves to their hearts’ content.      As with the DeFI craze described above, it’s very hard to stop people from speculating in a way that’s more or less the same thing as gambling. And as Triphati observes from his home in the U.K., it seems to go against a British way of life. “We live in the country of racehorses and epic sports betting,” he writes. “We are legendary gamblers, and it’s one of the traits that made Britannia rule the seas for at least four centuries, and then run global investment banking for at least one. When asked to stop, we tend to simply gamble elsewhere (e.g., in shadow banking instead of banking).”      While derivatives in general have a reputation for being, as Warren Buffett said, “weapons of financial destruction,” they do ultimately serve a real purpose in fueling overall liquidity and enabling sophisticated risk management. If you believe, as I do, that blockchains, tokens, smart contracts and decentralized exchanges will eventually evolve to a point that they form the foundation of a new financial system, the emergence of that more mature derivative market structure will benefit everyone, not just crypto speculators. Since crypto markets are still in their infancy, the speculative part naturally gets more attention than that market structure aspect right now. But the only way to get to the latter is through the former. Banning it isn’t constructive.      MONEY MAXIGELISTS. It’s not uncommon for people to describe crypto believers as members of a cult. Typically, that reference just refers to their fanaticism.But this piece by a fan of the privacy coin zcash, who uses the name Sixten Hodler, takes it to an entirely different level. The writer coins the term “maxigelism” – a portmanteau of “maximalism” and “evangelism” – to describe the zealotry of early Christian missionaries, who combined an insistence on their being only one true God with the claim that any disbelievers would go to hell, and compares it with a logic that will eventually deliver mass adoption of zcash, or “HyperZcashization.” Whether you swallow the argument or not, it’s a wild read.      Sixten Hodler claims that Bitcoin’s protocol – and the most fervent supporters – are like Judaism, which the writer describes as a solely maximalist position. (And indeed, Bitcoin maximalism, which rejects the legitimacy of all other cryptocurrencies, is a term used by many diehard bitcoin believers to describe themselves.) Both are exclusionary in that they have no room for other gods or currencies yet, Sixten Hodler maintains, both are also “missing the terrifying incentive that made Christianity evangelist.”      It’s zcash, which establishes the value of its privacy features as protection against the impending threat of the “surveillance state,” that best captures that early expansion in Christianity after it was created as a “fork of Judaism,” a nod to the idea that zcash is a fork of bitcoin. Bitcoin maximalists, with their belief in “radical transparency,” do not want their religion/currency community to grow too far, as that would expose users to the encroachment of the surveillance state, much as the Hebrews were always eager not to give imperialists an excuse to oppress them.

42384883,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlpXV,1602252065,Ethereum Is Manhattan and Everyone Is Moving to the Suburbs,"Few predicted the swift acceleration in the decentralized finance (DeFi) economy this year. The fervent activity in the space has sent DeFi assets skyrocketing to almost $11 billion – equivalent to almost twice the size of the economy of Barbados. Similarly, assets under management held by Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) have hit bumper levels, supported in large part by the continued growth in the decentralized economy.      Ethereum, the rails on which most open finance and DAO governance runs, needs to keep pace. Soaring DeFi transaction levels are adding significant demand and strain to the current network, with many DAOs adversely impacted by higher voting costs and slower transactions.      As things currently stand on Ethereum, only the most liquid, hyperconnected protocols will be able to thrive under the current demand on the network.      Back when the Aragon project released its first on-chain voting implementation, it cost just a few cents worth of ether (ETH) to vote. Now, with Ethereum being congested, it can cost up to $30 for a user or token holder to place a single vote.      The network congestion on Ethereum inspired the Aragon community and Balancer Labs to devise a solution that offers off-chain voting with on-chain execution via the Snapshot DAO governance tool. The solution arose not out of choice, but out of necessity for the respective communities.      Before a scalable version of Ethereum arrives in Ethereum 2.0, it’s likely many social innovators, DAOs and DeFi protocols will look to off-chain systems to meet their needs.      See also: DeFi Dad – Five Years In, DeFi Now Defines Ethereum    Ethereum’s 'pull' factor    Running a smart contract on Ethereum is like renting an apartment in Manhattan – you are hyper-connected to “a cultural center and the world of finance” but you pay a lot for a 500-square-foot studio. As an alternative, you can move to a new borough, such as Brooklyn or Queens, or out to the suburbs to get a nice house with more space and cheaper rent, but you’ll need to commute and you’ll be less well connected to the center of activity.      Similar to Manhattan, Ethereum could be considered a hive of decentralized activity; congested, but an important economic “‘pull factor”’ for the many different DeFi protocols. While some DAOs want connectivity above all and will remain running on Ethereum, others will not need hyperconnectivity as much as they may need lower costs. That’s where solutions like Ethereum 2.0, Cosmos or Polkadot can shine.    The advancement of off-chain and layer 2 technologies – and eventually Ethereum 2.0 – comes at an important time for these social DAOs looking to scale.    DeFi protocols, predictions markets and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are among the most prominent users on Ethereum today. All seek hyperconnectivity to interoperate – a hub for where DeFi creditors, lenders and communities all interconnect to leverage each others’ products. In essence, hyperconnectivity on Ethereum allows a protocol to open a vault on Maker, get dai, lend that dai on Aave, and then offer yield to their users, just one of the many examples of the “money legos” that open up with hyperconnectivity on Ethereum.      Indeed, many of the bigger DeFi protocols running on Ethereum today will continue to operate just fine without needing an added functional layer to scale. But for the growing emergence of social DAOs, the current network infrastructure will not fit with their longer-term operational or governance needs. (That said, many of the long-tail social DAOs do not need to be hyperconnected.)      These rapidly evolving social DAO communities need space and room to thrive. The advancement of off-chain and layer 2 technologies – and eventually Ethereum 2.0 – comes at an important time for these social DAOs looking to scale.      Similar to the less-crowded streets of New York City’s suburbs, these solutions can offer these DAOs a cheaper, faster, alternative model in which to operate. The lower costs and faster transaction speeds that will arise from these technologies should, therefore, provide an important advancement in DAO governance standards and social innovation.      See also: Ready Layer One: Base Layer Protocols Team for Virtual Developer Event      Just as the suburbs of New York City expanded and evolved over time, so, too, will the rollout of Ethereum 2.0 take time. But in the meantime we shouldn’t discard other options, including blockchains built on Cosmos SDK or Polkadot. Off-chain solutions, like Snapshot, or layer 2 virtual machines, will go a long way to meeting the requirements of DeFi and social DAOs.      These will be available to us in the very near future as we wait for Ethereum 2.0 to offer decentralized communities the essential infrastructure necessary to escape the congestion.",NEGATIVE,ETH,ATOM | BAL | BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ETH,Luis Cuende,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/09/ethereum-is-manhattan-and-everyone-is-moving-to-the-suburbs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/46a5fc5a1a0ba7f08843d1e7083018683a422094-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a news release Friday, the company said its subsidiary SBI e-Sports Co., Ltd. will issue 1,000 shares of common stock, with SBI Holdings as the underwriter.  The STO will be conducted on a blockchain platform called Ibet from Boostry – a Nomura Holdings-owned company that specializes in digital security infrastructure.  SBI Holdings further said it may go on to launch a business managing public offerings of digital corporate bonds through SBI Securities, another subsidiary of the SBI Group.  SBI Securities may also take on business related to holding STOs for assets such as real estate, fine arts and intellectual property, citing copyrights for games and movies as examples.  This would allow investors to own smaller shares of such assets, the company said.  SBI said it views use cases of blockchain technology such as STOs as ""core technology"" of fintech and that it's focusing on building business lines in the field.  SBI Holdings recently agreed to acquire crypto exchange TaoTao, and is already a partner of U.S.-based blockchain payments tech company Ripple, having launched a joint venture to offer a cash transfer app called Money Tap.

42384889,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlphZ,1602248787,"Bitcoin Must Now Beat $11.2K for Bull Revival, Say Analysts","Despite bitcoin's rally to three-week highs, some analysts remain cautious and want to see the cryptocurrency topple key resistance at $11,200 before calling a bullish revival.    The biggest cryptocurrency by market value has risen by 3.5% to levels above $11,000 in the past 24 hours, confirming an upside break of a narrowing price range represented by trendlines connecting Sept. 19 and Oct. 1 highs and Sept. 8 and Sept. 23 lows.  Bitcoin is currently trading near $11,050 – up 6% from lows below $10,400 seen earlier this month and the highest level since Sept. 20, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  While the recovery and the range breakout looks impressive, chart analysts and traders say $11,200 is now the level to beat for the bulls.  ""We consider the breakout of the Sept. 19 high of $11,200 to be a more significant catalyst for further upside,"" Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack Funds, told CoinDesk. He added the price range of $10,000 to $11,200 may hold until more clarity surfaces going into November U.S. elections.  Bitcoin's rejection near $11,200 on Sept. 19 was followed by a four-day sell-off to $10,200. In other words, the cryptocurrency established a lower high (marked by a circle in the chart above) at $11,200 – a bearish pattern.  As such, a break above $11,200 would be more credible evidence of a bullish breakout, as pointed out by Neo.  Meanwhile, Simon Peters, a crypto market analyst at investment platform eToro, said bitcoin needs to hold or establish a new base above $11,000, in which case it could make a move toward the next psychological hurdle at $12,000.  That's because bitcoin failed multiple times in mid-September to absorb selling pressure above $11.000.  And while Neo and Peters remain cautious, Phillip Gillespie, CEO of the over-the-counter liquidity provider B2C2 Japan is foreseeing a pick up in volatility in the near term, as U.S. elections, a large systematic risk even, are scheduled for Nov. 4.  ""If we weren't weeks away from the U.S. election, I would think we have a bullish setup in bitcoin,"" Gillespie said while sharing his view on Thursday's triangle breakout.

42405135,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLR4x,1602247175,First Mover: Bitcoin Hits $11K as Square Exposes $2.3T Corporate Money Pot,"Payments company Square's announcement that it would put some $50 million, or 1% of its assets, into bitcoin has touched off speculation that more corporations might do the same.      Jack Dorsey, the Twitter CEO who also helms Square, is a longtime bitcoin bull, so it wasn't a huge surprise his company would put some of its corporate liquidity into the cryptocurrency. He's following the path of MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, who has invested at least $425 million of the company's assets in bitcoin.      None other than Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, CEO of Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, tweeted a question: ""Who's going to be the 3rd public company to hold #bitcoin in treasury?"" Guesses included Twitter, Tesla, Apple, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, even the burger chain Wendy's.      ""It's a bit surreal to see gigantic corporate entities now going knee-deep in bitcoin,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics, wrote to subscribers on Thursday.      One clever, enterprising soul even ginned up a spreadsheet to keep track of the corporate purchases and published it as a new website, bitcointreasuries.org:      Companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks have a combined $2.3 trillion in cash and short-term investments. So a 1% across-the-board allocation to bitcoin would amount to $23 billion of purchases. That's just over 10% of bitcoin's total market capitalization, currently about $200 billion.      A big bullish investment thesis for bitcoin is that large institutional investors are on the verge of diving into cryptocurrencies as an asset class, led by money managers like Fidelity Investments that have embraced the new technology and digital-asset markets.      Now it seems like corporate purchases might add to that buying pressure.      Dorsey tweeted out a ""whitepaper"" to his 4.7 million followers explaining just how Square had come to buy its bitcoin — noting that the transparency was intended ""so others can do the same.""      ""To maintain transaction privacy and price slippage on execution, treasury purchased the bitcoin over-the-counter with a bitcoin liquidity provider that we currently use as part of Cash App’s bitcoin trading product,"" according to the whitepaper. ""We negotiated a spread on top of a public bitcoin index and executed trades using a time-weighted average price (TWAP) over a predetermined 24-hour period with low expected price volatility and high market liquidity, in order to reduce risks associated with cost and pricing.""      Got that, corporate treasurers?    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin has jumped over 3% in the past 24 hours to set a three-week high above $11,000.    The move has confirmed a contracting triangle breakout on the daily chart.  Even so, some analysts remain cautious and want to see the cryptocurrency take out resistance at $11,200 before calling a bullish revival.  ""We consider the breakout of the Sept. 19 high of $11,200 to be a more significant catalyst for further upside,"" Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack Funds, told CoinDesk. He added that the price range of $10,000 to $11,200 may hold until more clarity surfaces going into November U.S. elections.  The rise comes a day after payments company Square announced that it had put 1% of its total assets into the largest cryptocurrency by market cap.  Prices hit $11,023 at 11:05 UTC – the highest since Sept. 20, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  The rally to $11,000 marked an upside break from the past two week's range of about $10,500 and $10,800.    - Omkar Godbole    Token Watch    Tether (USDT), Solana (SOL): Tether launches on Solana, the ""web-scale"" blockchain, designed to compete with Ethereum and hopes to increase its transaction speeds while lowering costs.

42405137,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLR3y,1602245494,Looking for a Job in Crypto? Here Are 5 Skills You Need,"So, you’re trying to get a job in crypto. Do you need a degree to showcase your mastery of blockchain technology?      “No,” said Columbia University adjunct professor Omid Malekan, “because that almost doesn’t exist.”    This story is part of the CoinDesk U series about blockchain at universities. See our ranking of U.S. universities here.    Blockchain was expected to be the top-demanded hard skill in the job market in 2020, according to a LinkedIn annual report in January. Malekan, a blockchain consultant for clients like Citi who teaches an MBA course on blockchain and cryptocurrencies, says demand far outstrips supply in job postings at both crypto and non-crypto-native companies.      While the job market may have shifted during the COVID-19 economic downturn, startups are “hiring super aggressively” for engineering help, says Philipe Forte, partner at The BlockVenture Coalition, which brings together 41 university blockchain groups and 44 funds. Businesses including Walmart and JPMorgan are increasingly experimenting with new blockchain initiatives where non-technical folks are needed, he said.      Professors, students, recruiters and startup founders alike say a formal education isn’t what it takes to get a job in this sector. The pandemic’s stress on the university business model has made the payoff of a blockchain education even more questionable.      Instead, what these companies look for in new hires, Malekan said, is firsthand experience like “interacting with the blockchain, investing in bitcoin or yield farming on Ethereum.”      Here’s what our sources say are the top five skills you need to get your foot in the door.    1. Know the fundamentals    In job interviews at crypto-oriented companies, “the first thing that you’ll hear is: How does Bitcoin work?” says Nir Kabessa, former president of the Columbia Blockchain Club and founder of Yup, which rewards users with tokens for social media activity.      Kabessa was directly involved in expanding Columbia University’s blockchain curriculum and was a teaching assistant for Malekan. But when it came to learning the fundamentals, “I learned a lot from teaching myself and listening to guest speakers we had,” he said.      Read more: Bitcoin 101: What is Bitcoin?      Unable to return to campus this fall, Janice Ng, head of education at Blockchain at Berkeley, a leading student-run university club, moved the course online and opened up to non-Berkeley students. This is just one of the many free online programs aiming to break down the barrier to entry to this space.      “Everyone has heard of blockchain and its related buzzwords, but they do not necessarily know what it brings,” says Ng. “Teaching the fundamentals is our goal to make blockchain more accessible.”    2. If you’ve got it, flaunt it    Portfolios and projects will become more important as part of a candidate getting hired, says Tyler Wellner, partner at BlockVenture Coalition. “We’ll see a trend over the next 10 years that resumes start to get a bit more outdated,” he said.      If you’re applying for a developer role, contribute to open-source projects and let your code speak for itself, says Scott Olson, director of blockchain integrations at Truffle Suite, a smart contract development environment. Olson says his company has seen so many cases where applicants claim to know Solidity, Javascript or Typescript but get caught in the coding test round.      “Highlight your GitHub contributions and let people evaluate your code,” said Olson. “If you make a claim about anything technical, make sure you can back that up.”    3. Speak to the masses    When former Latcha+Associates marketing intern Chase Chapman felt it was unfair that people were not getting paid for their data, she looked to blockchain technology as a solution. Eventually, she founded her own startup, Decentology, to help make building on blockchain more accessible for mainstream users and developers. But she says it’s very hard to find someone who can effectively market their company to those folks and skilled developers alike.      Read more: The Top Universities for Blockchain      “You need to speak the language of the crypto-native while empathizing with mainstream users’ general lack of caring about the fact your product uses blockchain,” she said. “When you’re able to hit that sweet spot, you unlock a lot of value.”    4. Get familiar with different use cases    Nisreen Bahrainwala, co-founder of the Midwest Blockchain Consortium, a network of universities, entrepreneurs, and corporate partners, advised taking a page from her failed blockchain startup, Viveca, which tracked prescription data in an effort to tackle the U.S. opioid crisis. “Our tech was fine on paper but no one was paying for it,” she said.      The challenge arose when selling new technology that would conflict with legacy systems. Amid the pandemic, “no one in the healthcare industry had bandwidth to deal with a new technology,” she added. “Just because something is broken or subpar, doesn’t mean there are incentives to fix it.”      Read more: The Best Blockchain University Programs Actually Pay Students to Learn      Anthony DiPrinzio, head of BASF Blockchain Lab, works to find the right use cases and business models around blockchain technology for the company to pursue. “A lot of people get caught up in the hype” of using the technology, he said, “but they need to understand blockchain doesn’t solve all the problems.” It’s essential to understand how blockchain is being used in the market before pitching a new idea.    5. Make connections – even virtually    Conferences, which bring together companies, investors, influencers and newbies, are major forums for the crypto community where new ideas are exchanged and decisions are made. Events have largely shifted online, from ETHGlobal’s ETHOnline to local-turned-virtual marathons like LA Blockchain Summit and NY Blockchain Week – as well as CoinDesk’s own Consensus: Distributed conference in May.      “Back in 2019, students like us in the Midwest couldn’t go to all these big conferences on either coast,” said Bahrainwala.      This year may have kept most of the world at home, but use that to your advantage.      “These conferences, especially being virtual, are great opportunities to chat with people, network and give you a point of reference,” said Olson from Truffle Suite. When reaching out to a speaker after the conference mentioning a note from their talk, “it shows you did some legwork.”      “We get a lot of those cold emails, but if somebody mentioned something about what I talked about in a podcast, video or conference I spoke at, I’ll respond back.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Doreen Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/09/looking-for-a-job-in-crypto-here-are-5-skills-you-need,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/926d834e11569062fb1752bf1d4aaa910dac7aaa-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Secondly, it should support ""wider policy objectives"" and ""do no harm"" to monetary and financial stability.  Thirdly, it should ""promote"" innovation and efficiency.

In an increasingly digital world, central banks have started researching the benefits and risks of offering a ""general purpose"" digital currency as a way to ""evolve"" and pursue public policy objectives.  The group has now agreed that to move to an issuance of a CBDC, a nation must meet the three core criteria.  ""A CBDC robustly meeting these criteria and delivering the features set out by this group could be an important instrument for central banks to deliver their public policy objectives,"" the report states.  While the group pledged to continue with research and collaboration on this topic, it said that study is not a commitment to any actual issuance.  In a separate report Thursday, the Bank of Japan said it would move on to tests looking at the technical feasibility of the core functions and features required for CBDC. That proof-of-concept may then be followed by a pilot program ""if necessary.""  South Korea's central bank also said this week it would conduct tests of a digital won through 2021.  The sudden spate of announcements from global central banks regarding CBDCs comes as China appears to be fast moving closer to a launch of its digital yuan.  The People's Bank recently revealed some of the results of real-world tests of the initiative, indicating that 3.1 million digital yuan transactions had been made in a commercial setting, for an amount worth $162 million.

Per a company press statement on Wednesday, the Amsterdam Digital Asset Exchange (AMDAX) said the registration with De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) meant it could now go ahead and process crypto transactions.  The firm will also be allowed to store and provide custody of digital assets under the European Union’s (EU) newly implemented AML5 guidelines that came into effect on May 21.  Those guidelines, which some argue are killing crypto firms across the country, passed the Dutch Parliament earlier this year.  Amsterdam-based AMDAX said it will support private investors with portfolios beginning at 2.5 bitcoin (about $27,000 or €23,000 at press time).  The Dutch implementation of the regulations is very strict, usually including additional criteria for client assessments and for tracing the origin of money users want to invest.  DNB ""justly applies"" these regulations, said Valentino Cremona, co-founder and director at AMDAX.  With bitcoin often being associated with crime, the market needs a ""clear legal framework,"" Cremona said.  The exchange's registration with the central bank demonstrates to investors that cryptocurrency is ""a mature asset class, not for criminals, but for smart investors,"" he added.

On Friday, the Silicon Valley-based fintech unveiled its Line of Credit for customers using its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service, per a company blog post.  ""This is our first time testing a product offering in the lending space,"" a company spokesperson confirmed to CoinDesk. ""We may decide to build out a more robust offering in the future.""  According to Ripple, the credit line will enable small to medium enterprises to expand their business where they would otherwise face ""stalled growth,"" inhibiting their ability to compete with larger companies.  Those companies using ODL on RippleNet, a network of payment providers, will be able to buy XRP from Ripple on credit and will be charged a fee on the amount borrowed.  The service is designed to facilitate lower-cost financing for cross-border payments compared to traditional means and has been trialed by RippleNet customers via a pilot program, the company said.  ODL uses XRP as a ""bridge currency"" to facilitate cross-border payments. For example, a Canadian business that needs to pay a supplier in Israel but can't find a foreign exchange dealer willing to exchange loonies for shekels can instead convert the money into and out of XRP, quick snap.  In that same example, the credit line means that the Canadian firm doesn't have to front the money – it locks in a rate at the time of payment and then repays Ripple ""when it’s convenient,"" the company says.  Ripple holds 6.2 billion XRP (worth about $1.55 billion at current prices). Its stash accounts for 6% of the total XRP supply when counting both the 45 billion in circulation and 48.6 billion in escrow. The company periodically sells XRP into the market.
