42424293,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2mnPh,1636932906,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Drifts Lower After Taproot Upgrade; Ether Drops,"Good morning, Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin’s highly anticipated Taproot upgrade fails to produce any noticeable price pop.  Technician’s take: Short-term upside appears to be limited given the loss of positive momentum.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $64,514 +0.4%  Ether (ETH): $4,562 -1.7%  Market moves  Bitcoin was trading flat after Taproot, the blockchain’s biggest network upgrade in four years, went live.  The upgrade, which took effect at 5:15 coordinated universal time (1:15 a.m. HKT/SGT), had been closely tracked by cryptocurrency traders and analysts as a supporting market factor, though many experts had told CoinDesk earlier this month that the phase-in was likelier to be seen as a long-term technological advance than a near-term price catalyst.  The tech milestone was celebrated by Bitcoin enthusiasts, with at least one pop-up “Taproot.watch” website posting a commemorative (and somewhat amusing) video to ring in the blockchain’s new era.  “Although the Taproot upgrade is generally a positive development, the verdict is still out if it will make a big improvement to the blockchain world,” Apifiny CEO Haohan Xu wrote in emailed comments.  The largest cryptocurrency has been trading mostly in the low $60,000′s since hitting an all-time high near $69,000 last week. Researchers at the crypto exchange Kraken wrote Friday that buy orders are concentrating around $62,000, while there appear to be interested sellers around $67,000 to $69,000.     Technician’s take  Bitcoin Decline Could Stabilize Around $60K Support  Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below $65,000 as buyers continued to take some profits. Lower support is seen around $60,000, which could stabilize the current pullback.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the four-hour chart is near oversold levels, similar to Oct. 27, which preceded a near 10% price rise. This time, however, buyers could face resistance around $65,000 given the loss of upside momentum this week.  Indicators suggest a period of consolidation could persist after upside exhaustion signals appeared on the charts last week. Further, a negative divergence on the daily RSI suggests limited upside over the short-term.  The weekly chart showed improving price momentum, although a decisive breakout above $69,000 needs to be confirmed before projecting upside targets.

The CBOE said in a notice on its website that the new VanEck Bitcoin Strategy Fund will start trading under the ticker symbol “XBTF” on Tuesday, with a new-issue auction to open trading around 9:30 a.m. ET followed by dissemination of index data.  VanEck confirmed the planned launch in a press release Monday.  The launch date announcement comes just after the SEC late last week rejected VanEck’s proposal for a “spot bitcoin ETF” – one that invests directly in bitcoin rather than the futures contracts. The agency had previously delayed its final decision on the proposal in September.  The VanEck ETF going live next week would join a growing roster of bitcoin futures-based ETFs launched over the past month following years of denials and deferrals by the SEC for a bitcoin ETF designed to track the cryptocurrency’s price. Some industry commentators have noted that an ETF backed directly by bitcoin would more closely track the cryptocurrency’s price than one backed by bitcoin futures.  The XBTF ETF has a net expense ratio of 0.65% and will invest primarily in bitcoin futures listed and traded on the CME, according to the VanEck press release.  “Both cost and tax treatment are two essential considerations for investors, and we have made both front and center in the design of XBTF,” VanEck director of digital assets product Kyle DaCruz said in the press release.  According to VanEck, the average daily open interest in the CME’s bitcoin futures has increased from $77 million in average daily open interest in the first quarter of 2018 to approximately $1.5 billion in the third quarter of 2021.  In October, the SEC greenlit the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (stock ticker BITO), which subsequently listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The fund quickly gathered more than $1 billion in investor assets, the fastest ETF ever to hit the milestone.  Following ProShares’ much anticipated ETF launch, Valkyrie Investments’ bitcoin futures ETF started trading on the Nasdaq a couple weeks ago.  VanEck bitcoin futures ETF won SEC approval in late October and made a regulatory filing at the time suggesting a launch date of Oct. 25, but company officials had declined to comment since then on why the new fund had not yet launched.

StarCoin is aiming to help artists seize this moment, maximize their revenues and increase their autonomy. StarCoin is the first cryptocurrency that offers a crypto-backed record label to artists. First, it&apos;s important to outline the issues of today&apos;s music industry to understand the value that a crypto-backed record label could provide. Generally, when artists sign onto record labels, the label provides the artists with a loan so that they create their album. Artists usually do not make any revenue from their album once it is released until they have paid back the loan. Even once the artist has paid back the loan, the label usually takes the majority of the revenue through an 80/20 or 90/10 ratio at the artist&apos;s disadvantage. A crypto-backed record label is superior to the traditional record label-signing industry for several reasons. StarCoin is the first cryptocurrency to partner with a record label, allowing a holder of the cryptocurrency to be signed to a contract. StarCoin&apos;s community will have the opportunity every month to vote for their favorite artists, with artists with the most votes being able to sign a record label deal.

42410963,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtkJH,1636908600,Will the Holiday Season Bring Gifts or a Lump of Coal for Bitcoin Investors?,"We’re approaching Christmas and many expect the art of window dressing to take hold.  No, not on the streets of our towns, where shops prepare far too early for holiday sales. Rather, we’re talking the lengths portfolio managers are said to go to make it look like they made all the right bets in 2021.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  Is that what could be coming for the cryptocurrency markets in the next few weeks? If past mutual fund behavior is any guide, window dressing may not be a driving factor but there are still things portfolio managers do – or don’t do – that help drive up asset prices in their portfolios before New Year’s Eve.  For those unfamiliar with the theory, window dressing is the idea that portfolio managers sell their losing positions and buy more of their winners ahead of year-end reporting so they look like they’ve been making all the right moves. Among other consequences, that could punish already-losing securities and pump winners even higher.  Many studies have been done suggesting that may be the case, but they usually use quarter-end data to come up with their conclusions.  However, one study published in 2014 in the Review of Financial Studies used actual mutual fund equity trading data from 1999 to 2010. While not finding evidence of typical window dressing, researchers Gang Hu, R. David McLean, Jeffrey Pontiff and Qinghai Wang found something more nuanced.  “We find that both abnormally high institutional buying and abnormally low institutional selling are associated with price inflation,” they wrote. “We further show that the portion of buy trades increases sharply on quarter-end, and especially year-end, days. Further analyses reveal that institutional buying declines at year end, whereas institutional selling has an even larger decline at year end, thereby creating the high portion of buys.”  Basically, funds were increasing buys of their bigger stock positions up to near the year end, but they stopped selling at an even higher rate. That, in turn, contributed to higher prices for those assets.  There may be a reason that happens, according to the researchers.  “We do not find evidence of targeted trading with year-end sales; the decline in selling is not greater for stocks of which institutions hold large positions. However, unlike buying a stock, delaying the sale of a stock is in most cases costless. It therefore makes sense for managers to not sell any stock at year end if they are concerned about year-end net asset values.”  Profit taking?  Yet, an institutionally driven sell-off may be in the cards for crypto, if one analyst is correct.  Edward Moya, senior market analyst at currency trading platform Oanda, expects fund managers will dump their winners to realize gains for the year. In his view, the recent rally, spurred on by higher-than-expected U.S. inflation data, makes it more enticing to managers to sell off their bitcoin.  “As inflation worries grow, that will actually become a negative for bitcoin, because what’s going to happen is you’re going to be approaching year end and all of Wall Street wants to show that they are profitable in trading cryptos,” Moya said on Wednesday’s “First Mover” program on CoinDesk TV. “With bitcoin up over 120%, [ether] over 550%, I think you’re probably going to see some decent profit taking. So, I think that is going to be a big risk that you’re going to have in the short term.”  Counter to the general narrative that bitcoin will rally because of inflation fears, Moya foresees that very argument working against the cryptocurrency, at least until Dec. 31.  If inflation continues to climb at current rates or faster, “you’re going to see, I think, some panic selling,” Moya predicts. “Typically, when we have a major risk reversal on Wall Street, because bitcoin has been one of the most profitable trades out there, you’ll probably see some weakness. So, at some point within the next few months, you’ll have a decent pullback, maybe 10% or possibly 20%. But then I think ultimately, the long-term bullish trend will reassert itself.”  What the data tells us  One thing to look at is average trade size on some of the exchanges. While this is an imperfect measure, one could make a couple of assumptions. If average trading sizes are rising as prices fall, then that may be an indication that large holders such as institutions are unloading. If the averages are rising during an upswing, that could signal larger buys.  While bitcoin has fallen a little under 6% since hitting all-time highs earlier last week, it’s still up about 13% over the past 30 days.  As it turns out, average trading sizes are generally up, according to data provider Kaiko. The firm looked at the average daily trading sizes on eight exchanges since 2017 – Coinbase, Bitstamp, Kraken, Bitfinex, Gemini, Bitrex, ItBit and LMAX Digital (for which it only has year-to-date data) – which are particularly popular with institutional traders. As the charts show, average trading sizes are down from their springtime 2021 peaks.  Yet, when using a weighted average it appears average trading sizes have rebounded over the past couple of months. They’re not near their peak of $3,000 or so earlier this year but they are up from a recent low close to $2,000 and are now around $2,376 over the past 30 days.  The upshot: If average trade sizes continue to rise with price, that could indicate institutions may be adding to their positions into the very end of the year.  Selling alts for bitcoin?  Of course, bitcoin isn’t the only game in town when it comes to crypto. And those who did well in the so-called altcoins may sell those instead and plow it back into crypto, according to Rich Rosenblum, co-founder and president of trading firm GSR. He said there are many other factors such as the new bitcoin futures-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that launched over the past few weeks that outweigh what funds are doing. Rosenblum also said his firm expects bitcoin to close the year at an all-time high.  “People are taking profits on their [alt] tokens [and] rolling it into bitcoin because bitcoin has been de-risked,” Rosenblum told “First Mover” this past Thursday. “It’s not a stablecoin, but rarely do I hear anyone thinking it could go below $50,000 ever again … If you’ve made a good amount of gains in other aspects of crypto, you might, instead of rolling back into a stablecoin or cash, you leave your money in bitcoin. So, I think that this past month, you’ve seen a lot of air go into bitcoin, because of the extreme strength that’s been into tokens.”  There are just seven weeks left in the year, and it seems there’s no consensus on which will win out: the HODLers (steadfast accumulators) or the profit takers. It’s at least worthwhile to keep an eye on average trading sizes in bitcoin and how the alts behave over the coming weeks for clues.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Lawrence Lewitinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/14/will-the-holiday-season-bring-gifts-or-a-lump-of-coal-for-bitcoin-investors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38e3467fb27063c5da31348485911a0daaa3ae56-5000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424278,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2mmzh,1636851892,Cream Plunges on News That Hack Compensation Will Inflate Token Supply,"The price of decentralized finance (DeFi) money market and lending service C.R.E.A.M. Finance’s token plunged Saturday for the second time in less than a month.  The first time came after an attack drained Cream’s coffers, the latest when Cream announced its plan to do right by the victims.  To recompense victims of the attack, Cream said it will issue to certain affected members 1.45 million CREAM tokens from the service’s treasury. While Cream has 9 million coins outstanding, per CoinMarketCap, only 150,000 of those are in circulation. By so rapidly expanding the supply of coins in circulation, it’s bound to affect demand and therefore the per-coin price.  And affect it it did. The price of the coin fell from around $88 to as low as $51.78, according to Messari, before rebounding to $56.44 in recent trading. Before the exploit on Oct. 27, CREAM was trading above $152.  Perhaps adding momentum to Saturday’s plunge is that most of the funds that had been exploited were in well-established cryptocurrencies such as Ether. To get paid back with a lesser-known crypto like CREAM might leave a sour taste in investors’ mouths even if the increase of coins in circulation wasn’t a factor.
