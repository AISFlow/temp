42427029,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyexh,1472080654,Moscow Government to Explore Blockchain Voting,"Government officials in Moscow today revealed plans to investigate applications of blockchain technology.  According to a report by Gazeta.ru, Deputy Head of the Department of Information Technologies (DIT) of Moscow Andrey Belozerov said that the agency is now exploring how to apply blockchain to various use cases, including voting fraud.  One proposal, according to the news source, would find Moscow incorporating blockchain into Active Citizenhttps://veliovgroup.com/article/yMCeuYPdubaeWeYDP/active-citizen, an in-progress e-government effort aimed at getting citizens more involved in local decision-making.  Sberbank  , one of Russia's largest banks, may participate in the effort.  The announcement is the latest to follow an apparent uptake in interest in the technology domestically, one that has mirrored developments globally.  Though elements of the government had previously pushed for a ban on cryptocurrencies, these positions have changed in recent weeks as major financial institutions have expressed interest in exploring its use.

42427037,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyf9h,1472069105,Settlement Coin Creators Seek to 'Liberalize' Central Banks With Blockchain,"Two resources available almost exclusively to central banks could soon be opened up to additional users as a result of a new digital currency project designed by a little-known startup and Swiss bank UBS.  One of those resources is the real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system used by central banks (it's typically reserved for high-value transactions that need to be settled instantly), and the other is central bank-issued cash.  Using the Utility Settlement Coin (USC) unveiled today, the five-member consortium that has sprung up around the project aims to help central banks open-up access to these tools to more customers. If successful, USC has the potential to create entirely new business models built on instant settling and easy cash transfers.  In interview, Robert Sams, founder of London-based Clearmatics, said his firm initially worked with UBS to build the network, and that BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank, ICAP and Santander are only just the first of many future members.  According to Sams, the offering of tools traditionally held tightly by central banks to more people wouldn't so much be disruptive, as it would be the fulfillment of a long-standing industry demand.  Sams said:  ""There's been conversations for years about liberalizing access to banks' RTGS systems. There's been a debate for a long time about if banks should liberalize access to central banks money. What we’re doing with USC is very much consistent with that renewed momentum.""  Digital assets  Perhaps what caught most of the attention with the project, however, was USC's use of not just a distributed ledger, but one that would find participants trading ""digital assets"" or blockchain-based code.  Whereas consortium R3CEV recently filed a patent for a distributed ledger with no digital tokens, Sams said the Utility Settlement Coin (USC) is a fundamental part of the settlement process in the system it designed.  The USC is built on top of the startup's Decentralized Clearing Network, a blockchain platform originally created to help members settle instruments and automate post-trade processes for OTC markets.  Now that the service is being shopped around to central banks, the digital coin is playing an increasingly important role  ""Cash is a leg to almost every trade,"" said Sams, who previously worked for nine years as a derivatives trader with Sanctum FI, also in London. ""In order to get most of the benefits of a distributed ledger in settlement, there has to be cash on a distributed ledger rail.""  How transactions might be processed, and who will own the nodes, has also not been shared. But what we do know based on a statement from the company is that Clearmatics described the USC as ""a series of cash assets"" for currencies, including US dollars, euros, British pounds and Swiss francs.  The digital asset is designed to be convertible at parity with a bank deposit in the corresponding currency, according to the same statement. Sams described USC as a form of digital cash that is ""fully backed by cash assets at the central bank"".  He added:  ""It’s like a form of synthesized central bank money, which is very different than commercial bank money.""  Over the coming months, the consortium plans to unveil different aspects of its effort, including further technological components of how it works.  A non-disclosure agreement prevented Sams from sharing details about who will custody the digital currency, he said.  Business opportunities  Months after raising $1.3m from Route 66 Ventures and others, the London-based startup partnered with UBS to begin work on the project.  The digital asset and the ledger have been built from the earliest stages with participation from various central banks, according to Sams, but he wasn’t able to name which ones, or how many. However, he did add that the focus of the work has been on OECD economies.  Sams described the network as a market-wide consortium utility ""that it is built to run a piece of market infrastructure"".  By synthesizing central banks cash and opening up access to RTGS systems, consortium member Deutsche Bank sees potential new business models that could be created.  Deutsche Bank’s head of global transaction banking, Ed Budd, said the bank is using its status as an early member of the consortium to search for undiscovered business opportunities, not just new technological capabilities.  On the capital market side, he says his colleague, managing director of Deutsche Bank’s Institutional Client Group, Paul Maley, is interested in how the digital currency will be treated as an asset from a balance sheet perspective. Budd is more focused on the potential of ""how this might lay out over the course of time medium and long term"".  Budd said:  ""Our focus is on how we can best apply technology to the businesses we operate in. The opportunity here was the use and access to a central bank digital currency, a key design principle for many of the markets that we work with.""  Growing the network  Over the coming months Budd says Deutsche Bank and the other consortium members will work to identify additional business opportunities on behalf of its clients, with new members to be announced.  According to Sams, there isn’t yet a solid timeline for development, but he says he expects ongoing conversations with multiple central banks to continue.  Sams concluded:  ""While there are now five entities involved in the project, the intention is that in a later phase that the consortium will include some of the major parties in the industry.""

42427034,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyf5h,1472058905,A Cryptographer Named After Harry Potter's Archenemy is Helping Solve Bitcoin's Biggest Problems,"In what could become the latest strange-but-true chapter in bitcoin’s history, an anonymous cryptographer named after Harry Potter’s arch nemesis has put forth a proposal experts believe could help solve major issues facing the network.  Authored by ‘Tom Elvis Jedusor’ (Voldemort's name in the French versions of the book), the Harry Potter references in the paper don’t stop there. The proposal itself, posted to chat channels earlier this August, is named ‘Mimblewimble’ after a tongue-tying curse meant to render an opponent silent.  Yet despite the allusions to the popular fantasy series, the paper has real-world implications, outlining how cryptographic privacy and signature techniques could be combined to enable new benefits. Experts soon saw past the imagery and began to take the ideas seriously, with Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra, for example, being one of the first to remark in IRC discussions that it didn’t seem like a “total crank.”  More serious conversation would follow, as bitcoin developers have been more broadly searching for a long-term scalability and anonymity solutions. Many of these same developers now feel that the anonymously posted idea could advance discussions of how these challenges can be solved.  Bitcoin Core contributor Bryan Bishop told CoinDesk:  “[We’re] talking very seriously about Voldemort as a serious cryptographer that submitted an obviously insightful development.”  Scalability potential  Today, scalability is seen as an area where bitcoin, and all blockchains, need improvement.  Bitcoin developers have thus far rallied around the Lightning Network, an off-chain payments channel, as a way to “scale” the platform from roughly 7-transactions per second to Visa-level payments. But Mimblewimble could offer an alternative way to slim down the blockchain.  With bitcoin, users need to download the full transaction history (not a small amount of data) to verify that everything checks out.  “In Mimblewimble, you can actually cut out all of the middle transactions. Imagine that every block has a single transaction,” Poelstra said. “When you’re syncing the blockchain all this historical data, it doesn’t quite go away, but it’s compressed a lot.”  “That’s the innovation of Mimblewimble. It scales with how much the system is being used currently, rather than how long the system has been going,” he added.  Poelstra also noted that the proposal offers “much more than ‘better scaling.’”  No more privacy, scalability tradeoff?  And then there’s privacy.  Because the blockchain is an open ledger that anyone can read or write to, bitcoin is not as anonymous as it has been framed over the years. This is unappealing both to privacy advocates and businesses that want to use bitcoin, but don’t want their financial information on display to competitors or the rest of the world.  With most privacy methods proposed so far for bitcoin, there’s a tradeoff between scalability and privacy. One of the downsides of Confidential Transactionshttps://people.xiph.org/~greg/confidential_values.txt, a technique that developers are currently experimenting with on a sidechain, is that it requires larger transaction sizes.  “These solutions are very good and would make bitcoin very safe to use. But the problem of too much data is made even worse. Confidential Transactions require multi-kilobyte proofs on every output, and van Saberhagen signatures require every output to be stored forever, since it is not possible to tell when they are truly spent,” the proposal explains.  Mimblewimble offers a way around this by combining a couple of older cryptographic techniques suggested for bitcoin: signature aggregation and Confidential Transactions.  With signature aggregation, it’s possible to squeeze all the signatures from a single block into one. This could potentially reduce the size of the blockchain, while not compromising on the security of the transactions.  Confidential Transactions, proposed by Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell, are the other piece of the puzzle, providing a method of shielding the transaction amounts so that only the sender and recipient can see how much is transferred.  Mimblewimble mashes these two techniques together.  “Basically it’s a way of combining the benefits of those two solutions into one package. We can aggregate all the signatures together and we can also get the privacy benefits of confidential transactions,” Bishop explained.  Future development  Developers seem excited enough about the proposal, so much so that Bishop says someone (though probably not its anonymous inventor) will likely present the idea at the Scaling Bitcoin conference in Milan, Italy, next month.  But challenges remain. One big issue with Mimblewimble is that doesn’t work with bitcoin’s current scripting language.  “It cannot be deployed to bitcoin as is,” Bishop explained. “It would require turning off all these amazing features that are widely used by everyone.”  Mimblewimble only can work with a simpler system where transactions are sent directly to another party and nothing more complicated than that. In other words, planned upgrades like smart contracts and micropayments channels are incompatible with Mimblewimble, at least as it is currently described.  Further, Poelstra said it could be implemented in an altcoin or one day on a pegged sidechain. But it’s also possible that other developers will come up with another clever idea for implementation.  “Developers haven’t even begun to think through the unique ways this could be deployed,” Bishop concluded, adding:  ”I imagine we’re going to see a lot of creative ideas for this in the future.”  Image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/08/24/a-cryptographer-named-after-harry-potters-archenemy-is-helping-solve-bitcoins-biggest-problems,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6b572adbfa1a82bd329754e8533582801a3efaa4-1500x717.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42427036,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyfBh,1472052397,R3 Files Patent Application for Distributed Ledger Tech,"New York startup R3CEV is reportedly attempting to patent a blockchain-inspired financial platform.  According to The Wall Street Journal, a patent filing for a software product dubbed ""Concord"" took place earlier this week. The startup is said to be aiming for a 2017 launch of the platform, with initial testing taking place later this year.  R3 did not respond to requests for comment at press time, nor was the patent accessible in US Patent & Trademark Office searches.  Unlike public blockchains like bitcoin and ethereum, transactions on Concord are said to be shared only with approved parties using the platform, a move that would follow criticisms about confidentiality in the private blockchain space.  Further, the platform is said to lack a cryptocurrency or digital asset.  In an interview with the Journal, R3 co-founder and COO Todd McDonald described it as a ""total re-imagining of the back office"". According to the report, R3 hopes that the platform will attract developers from the finance world who can build applications on top of its technology.

42427028,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyeph,1472048634,MIT Study Reveals New Data on Free Bitcoin Airdrop,"In the spring of 2014, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology unveiled an ambitious plan.  Spurred by active enthusiasts on campus, the prestigious US university raised $500,000 with the goal of distributing $100 in bitcoin to every student on campus. Completed in the fall of 2014, the project would spur similar experiments at campuses around the globe.  But despite the buzz around the so-called bitcoin airdrop, not much was known about its success or the impression it left on students. Now, a study by MIT researchers has provided new details by using the event as a way to research ""early adopters"", or individuals likely to be among the first to use or evangelize for a new technology.  Though the study seeks to broadly answer questions about early technology adoption, the incidental findings in the report provide context about how the bitcoin airdrop was received by students.  For example, the study indicates that 3,108 undergraduates signed up for a digital wallet, with 89% reporting they were new to the digital currency. Thirty-five percent of those were interested in bitcoin as an investment, with 20% noting an interest in its use for online transactions.  The study also interpreted the ""cashing out"" of bitcoin into traditional currency as a sign an early adopter had given up interest in the technology, meaning it provide details on how inclined students were to keep the funds.  Researchers obtained data from hosted digital wallet providers to track the rate of bitcoin sales, finding that early adopters (those who signed up early to receive bitcoin) were more likely to cash out of bitcoin when they were delayed access to the digital currency relative to their peers.  The report's authors wrote:  ""The more we delayed such a person, the more likely they were to cash out immediately as their need for cash became more and more pressing.""  According to the study, 11% of students sold their bitcoin within two weeks of receiving it, though the researchers suggest it was possible the funds could have been transferred to another wallet service.  Ultimately, the study is inconclusive about the nature of the sales, suggesting that early adopters may have been more informed about the price of bitcoin. However, it noted these students did not ""cash out on average at better prices"" than their peers.  For more details, read the full report by Christian Catalini and Catherine E Tucker.

42427033,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyevh,1472039724,Blockchain Startup Chronicled Launches Ethereum IoT Registry,"In an effort to build a standard for the emerging Internet of Things (IoT), Chronicled is open sourcing a tool for registering connected devices on the ethereum blockchain.  Described as a ""cross between Wikipedia and Carfax"" for consumer goods, the platform will register the identities of near-field communication (NFC) and bluetooth low energy (BLE) chips, components of IoT that today allow smartphones to “talk” with other devices.  While the IoT has been hailed as an inevitability, technology experts ague that a fragmentation of standards have held back its adoption. Today, industry companies are each developing their own way for devices to communicate, but Chronicled's founders want to use the ethereum blockchain to make private IoT database registries interoperable.  Chronicled CEO Ryan Orr told CoinDesk:  ""What’s missing is interoperability for all those chips so that when a consumer is out in the world, they can interact with their world in a ubiquitous, seamless way. Right now it’s completely broken.""  So far, Chronicled has deployed 10,000 NFC and BLE chips, most of which are embedded in limited edition sneakers or other apparel, and each device is matched with a record of identity on the ethereum blockchain to reduce counterfeiting of luxury items.  Sneakers are the company’s first use case, but the team’s goal from day ""zero"", according to Orr, was to transition to other consumer goods and to expand to a public blockchain database.  To achieve this, Chronicled is also collaborating with existing IoT companies, including semiconductor company Silicon Labs and Blue Bite, a New York-based BLE firm.  Securing devices  As with other startups in the industry, Orr said he sees blockchains as a way to enable a machine-to-machine economy by which devices can more easily, and safely, interact.  ""Machines need to have identities so that machines can come to a decision on whether or not to trust the other machine or to understand where it’s from, which services it might be able to offer,"" Orr argued.  He offered the example whereby an Amazon drone would deliver a package through the window of a home. Using IoT devices, he said, the window could verify instantly whether or not the drone is safe, potentially with public information off of the Amazon website, and enable the drone to drop off real-world goods.  ""Verifying the identity of a device in a secure and public way is the first step to doing hundreds of different things on top of it,"" Orr said.  A key attribute that makes blockchains primed for such use cases, according to the team, is that anyone can use it to register a device.  This is something that third-party developers are more likely to want to build on, Orr asserted.  Why ethereum  With the announcement, the company is releasing tools for developers, including starter kits, SDKs and an “Open Registry Explorer” so that any developer can use the platform to tag devices themselves. But a key component will also be ethereum, a public blockchain platform.  Despite recent setbacks, Orr said that there were multiple ""dimensions"" to Chronicled’s decision to use ethereum over other blockchains. In particular, he pointed to its flexibility and transparency, which he said helps with the company’s goal of building an interoperable standard.  ""The ethereum project is at a critical mass globally. It could become a global standard in respect to product authentication,"" he said.  It’s also worth noting that ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin is on board with the idea. ""Consumer IoT has always been one of the areas of blockchain adoption that I have been most bullish about,"" Buterin said in a statement.  Other companies are also experimenting with combining the two budding technologies. Filament, for example, raised $5 in Series A funding last year to enable connected devices to communicate.  Orr said that Chronicled eventually hopes to partner with other companies, such as 21 Inc, to continue its work toward this goal.

42427039,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyfFh,1471999310,Litecoin Price Spikes 10% as Coinbase Exchange Turns on Trading,"Litecoin prices rose nearly 10% today as word the digital currency would be listed on Coinbase's GDAX exchange spread among traders.  The move by the exchange to list LTC/USD and LTC/BTC currency pairs, however, was long anticipated, given that litecoin creator Charlie Lee has worked at the startup since 2013. Launched in 2011 and branded the ""silver to bitcoin's gold"", litecoin aims to offer faster transaction confirmation times for merchants.  At press time, it was the fourth larest digital currency by market cap.  Notably, litecoin prices began edging upwards far before the actual announcement, spurred by cryptic tweets and messages from Lee. According to data from BitcoinWisdom, the price of litecoin began to spike at roughly 9:00 UTC, rising from $3.58 to roughly $3.80 at 18:00 UTC, the time of the announcement.  During the session, LTC rose 9.3% to $4.01 amid heavy volume.  But, the move may have been subdued, as the market has long been aware of GDAX’s plans to list litecoin. (The exchange first revealed it would add the digital currency at some later date on 20th May).  Data suggests traders may have gone so far as to price in this listing long before it happened, as LTC rose to $4.83 by 28th May and $5.95 by 17th June, CoinMarketCap figures reveal.  At the time trading began on 23rd August, 1 LTC cost $3.66, nearly 40% below the high reached in mid-June.  Several traders reported to hearing rumors about the exchange’s plans as well, with one remarking the market likely ""bought the rumor and sold the news"".  Temporary bump  While the increase is notable, some analysts emphasized it could merely be a temporary bump. In addition, others voiced their concerns about litecoin's long-term viability, echoing criticisms that have long faced the project about its lack of innovative features.  Petar Zivkovkski, director of operators for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, told CoinDesk the move does nothing to change the digital currency’s ""fundamentals"".  ""The fact that GDAX added the pair to trade has given it temporary bullishness, but unfortunately we do not see this lasting unless some other catalyst provokes a sustained trend,"" he said.  Arthur Hayes, CEO of leverage bitcoin trading platform BitMEX, also painted a picture of LTC’s price gains being only temporary.  ""The price move was in anticipation of the addition of litecoin by Coinbase,"" he told CoinDesk.  Going forward, it will be interesting to see whether litecoin can maintain either the price gains or robust trading volume it enjoyed today. Still, most traders were bearish on the idea.  Once valued at more than $48 during the bitcoin boom of late 2013, litecoin has since struggled to grow its market. Others suggested the move was motivated by GDAX’s need to add additional currencies to complement bitcoin and ether, which it added earlier this year.  ""GDAX is presumably just responding to trader interest,"" said cryptocurrency investment fund manager Jacob Eliosoff.
