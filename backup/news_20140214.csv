42376897,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6gJtF,1392418397,Bitcoin Processors Reconsider Marijuana Stance After New FinCEN Ruling,"The US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) released new guidance on 14th February for financial institutions seeking to provide services to marijuana-related businesses, ending a long silence that has caused confusion among those in both industries.  FinCEN indicated that financial services companies can now work with marijuana-related businesses in states where the drug has been legalized for medical or recreational purposes. This is provided it is ""in a manner consistent with their obligations to know their customers and report possible criminal activity"".  Said the agency  :  ""Providing clarity in this context should enhance the availability of financial services for marijuana businesses. This would promote greater financial transparency in the marijuana industry and mitigate the dangers associated with conducting an all-cash business.""  Speaking to CoinDesk, a representative of Spokane, Washington-based dispensary Kouchlock Productions, which accepts bitcoin, was elated about the news:  ""This is a huge step for the marijuana industry and for our country financially.""  The company also said it was equally excited about the possibility of working with bitcoin payment processors for its ongoing trial.  However, while the announcement opens the door for all manner of financial services providers, from banks to credit cards to bitcoin payment processors, to potentially serve the industry, bitcoin payment businesses are split about a potential path forward.  Major processors respond  Speaking to CoinDesk, Georgia-based processor BitPay indicated that its policy of not working with marijuana businesses would remain unchanged.  A company spokesperson explained:  ""The Merchant Terms of Use for BitPay specify that all businesses must adhere to US federal law, and marijuana is an item that is prohibited to sell nationally.""  Its San Francisco-based competitor Coinbase seemed more open to adjusting its position, saying:  ""We are reviewing FinCEN's updated guidance and our policy on this subject.”  Coinbase had previously declined to work with marijuana merchants, citing the drug's federal ban as the reason.  However, should it decide to adapt its policies, the specific terms for dealing with marijuana businesses may prove onerous for the still-growing company. FinCEN listed eight areas where it says financial services companies must conduct due diligence in regards to marijuana businesses.  Impact on bitcoin use  Recently, marijuana businesses in the US had begun to turn to bitcoin as a potential solution to their inability to work with major financial institutions. As such, some in the virtual currency community saw the industry as one that could develop into a powerful use case that would bring new customers and merchants into the ecosystem.  As with the porn industry, which is also embracing bitcoin, marijuana purchasers favor privacy, and are technologically savvy. Further, websites like Silk Road and Black Market Reloaded lead some members of this community to become early adopters of the virtual currency.  However, the announcements by BitPay and Coinbase are notable as the industry could fail to realize this potential.  Should banks and traditional financial services providers move to develop a presence in this industry, bitcoin would likely lose an early mover advantage to a burgeoning market.

42413302,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8MAm,1392413732,New Jersey Case Could Set Restrictive Precedent for Bitcoin Businesses,"Though we have only hints at what regulation could result from last month's NYDFS hearing in New York, members of both sides largely agree the dialogue did much to improve relations between New York regulators and the bitcoin community.  Despite the steps forward, however, recent actions taken by the state's southern neighbor New Jersey suggest that US law enforcement is going the extra mile to try and prevent any potential bitcoin threats, no matter how dubious.  In a controversial move, the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs issued a subpoena this December against Jeremy Rubin, a 19-year-old bitcoin developer and MIT student, who, along with three other students, has created an innovative computer code called Tidbit.  Tidbit would allow web surfers to put their computer power toward bitcoin mining, providing a website with the proceeds of this activity in exchange for the ability to view content without advertising.  New Jersey doesn't quite see the innovation, and the implications of its potential victory in court could have an impact on the wider bitcoin business community.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which is representing Rubin, told CoinDesk:  That means Bitcoin innovators will have to be very careful with what they do and understand that there is going to be scrutiny into their activities.""  Necessary action?  The subpoena isn't just asking introductory questions about Tidbit.  Rather, law enforcement officials have moved aggressively to prompt Rubin to turn over all of Tidbit's assets, including its source code, related bitcoin wallets, agreements with third parties, as well as the name and IP addresses associated with its development team, all of whom are undergraduates at MIT. Though, it should be noted it stopped short of accusing Rubin of criminal wrongdoing.  Looking more closely at recent headlines from the state, the action may not be surprising. Last November, E-Sports Entertainment settled for $1m after it was accused of using malicious software code to illegally mine bitcoin on the computers of state residents.  At peak power, the company was able to take control of 14,000 computers without users' knowledge and generate $3,500 in profits over two-week span. It was eventually accused of violating the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act and the New Jersey Computer Related Offenses Act.  Indeed, the language of the Tidbit subpoena suggests this interpretation as it asks Rubin to turn over ""all documents and correspondence concerning all breaches of security and/or unauthorized access to computer"".  CoinDesk  Comparisons between E-Sports' botnet program and Tidbit's mining program certainly exist, but the accusations against Tidbit are particularly puzzling to many for one reason.  As Rubin has noted in an interview  , Tidbit is incomplete, in part so the terms and conditions of its use under the law could be established. Further, he says no one has ever used the program to mine bitcoin.  Mounting a defense  Initially developed at the Node Knockout Hackathon, where it won a prize for innovation, Tidbit was lauded for its out-of-the-box thinking to a problem that has long dogged the Internet, a dependance on advertising.  — Chris Matthieu (@chrismatthieu) December 2, 2013  Since the announcement of the subpoena, however, reaction from the bitcoin community has been marked by confusion and disappointment with US law enforcement.  — Duane Johnson (@canadaduane) February 13, 2014  The EFF has been the most vocal about its support, questioning whether New Jersey has the legal standing to pursue any action based on the fact that Rubin is not a resident.  A spokesperson for the EFF told CoinDesk:  ""New Jersey had no jurisdiction to issue a subpoena to Rubin, who lived in Massachusetts, or Tidbit, which had no connections to New Jersey at all; the server housing the code is not located in New Jersey and Tidbit didn't do anything to target New Jersey users specifically.""  The EFF believes the subpoena should be thrown out on three counts, and is ""hopeful"" it will be quashed.  For now, plans for Tidbit are in flux. The developers had earlier aimed to launch a beta release in February, adding support for litecoin to the trial.  However, the future viability of these objectives will likely depend on the first hearing in the case to be held later this February.  At press time, the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs had not responded to requests for comment.

42376901,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6gK5p,1392408243,MIT Report Finds Bitcoin More Likely to be Spent than Hoarded,"Newly released research from the MIT Technology Review, a faculty-run university magazine, suggests that new bitcoins are increasingly being spent, not hoarded, by users after purchase.  The data illustrates that the number of unspent, new bitcoins has declined drastically from 2009, when nearly half of all new bitcoins were held for the entire first year of ownership. Today, the vast majority of new bitcoins are spent within 24 hours, the findings suggest.  The results  led the researchers to conclude:  ""New bitcoins are now more likely to be spent than hoarded by speculators.""  Such findings provide evidence that bitcoin is evolving as a currency, and that while far from mass adoption, liquidity is on the rise in the system. Though, no formal definition of ""spending"" was given to fully clarify the data.  Data was drawn from a variety of sources, including bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain, Bitcoin Charts, Coinmarketcap and bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.  Further, Sarah Meiklejohn, one of the most well-known block chain analysts, compiled the data.  A closer look at the data  For its research, MIT examined bitcoin data from 2009 through 2013, and found that the vast majority of transactions conducted with new bitcoins occurred within seven days of their generation.  Hard percentages were not provided on the released material.  There was also a visible decline in transactions completed after one to 12 months of ownership, and those spent after one year of ownership, with the later category all but disappearing from the graph starting in 2012.  The number of new bitcoins that went unspent did rise from 2011 to 2013, but this level was down from figures observed in 2009 and 2010.  Reports from 2012  had previously suggested that as much as 78% of all bitcoins were being saved for later use.  Debunking hoarding  The report is relevant as it directly rebuffs the arguments of bitcoin critics, who have argued that the lack of bitcoin spending is indicative of its inability to ""ignite"" as a payments system.  Such arguments have contended that, compared to traditional payment products, bitcoin's development has been slow, and that this is a sign that it will not evolve as a payment system or that it is not ready for large-scale use.  The issue of bitcoin's perceived lack of liquidity, for example, was a major point of discussion during the first day of NYDFS regulator hearings in New York. Such speculation is likely fueled by polls that suggest bitcoin users are increasingly bullish about its value, and therefore unwilling to part with their coins.  This argument is perhaps best explained by Wired editor Cade Metz:  ""If economic incentives encourage people to hoard their bitcoins rather than spend them, the thinking goes, the currency will never fulfill the extravagant promises laid down by the biggest believers, who say it will streamline monetary transactions, free the world from the financial manipulation of big government and big banks, breakdown the financial walls between nations, and, well, remake the worldwide economy.""  However, the MIT report suggests that the increasing number of merchants and consumers using bitcoin is changing the ecosystem, and that this rise in spending could continue as bitcoin use among both demographics increases.

42376942,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6gK23,1392397559,The Evolution of the Bitcoin Clearing House,"We may be witnessing the final months of the large international bitcoin exchanges for retail purposes. On the road to maturity, the survivors are most likely to emerge as supra-regional bitcoin clearing houses.  Today’s global bitcoin exchange plays the mega-role of both retail and wholesale exchange, providing the platform for individual traders, corporate traders, and smaller bitcoin exchanges. Due to a dearth of functioning exchanges in many active bitcoin countries, traders are forced to look outside of their home jurisdiction for liquidity and they tend to go international.  In finance, a clearing house is an institution that provides clearing and settlement services for financial and commodities derivatives and securities transactions. The origin of cheque clearing for banks can be traced back to the 1770s.  With bitcoin, a clearing house can be thought of as a wholesale liquidity provider clearing transactions in an over-the-counter (OTC) market or a futures exchange.  [post-quote]  By standing between two member clearing firms, a clearing house reduces the settlement risks by netting offsetting transactions between multiple counterparties and by providing independent valuation of trades and collateral accounts.  When bitcoin derivatives are inevitably introduced, margin deposits will be involved, requiring the clearing house to monitor the credit worthiness of member clearing firms and, ideally, to establish and maintain a guarantee fund that can be used to cover losses that exceed deposited collateral from a defaulting clearing firm.  The Russia-based ICBIT exchange offers a bitcoin derivatives market today.  As more and more trading for bitcoin occurs locally, the need for international bitcoin exchanges will diminish and the remaining exchanges will have to evolve in order to remain relevant. Initially, some may function in a dual capacity as both exchange and clearing house during the transition period.  Forces of change  Two separate forces are at work driving this trend within the local bitcoin environment.  Local bitcoin exchanges  catering to a country or region allow the easiest method for buying and selling bitcoin because, as local players, they understand the existing electronic payment networks and the dynamics of how best to integrate with their country’s banks. Also, since bitcoin is ultimately more frightening to central banks than it is to normal retail banks, the inevitable is starting to happen.  Banks are beginning to explore methods of incorporating bitcoin services directly into their proprietary online offerings. And why not? Banks have the proven expertise in currency trading, deposit holding, secure IT environments, and payments. They should exploit this advantage.  If retail bitcoin exchanges cannot provide greater privacy and service than banks, then why are they needed to sit between you and your bank? The answer is that they probably are not needed – at least not in the same way. As more bitcoin exchanges request the opening of commercial bank accounts, the banks are gradually realizing that bitcoin services may be a direct opportunity for themselves.  Losing the middlemen  Exemplified by the recent announcement from South Africa's Standard Bank, a bitcoin pilot program tested by the bank eliminates the need for a retail bitcoin exchange in the middle of the transaction. Partially owned by China's biggest bank, ICBC, Standard Bank is the largest bank operating in Africa.  Similarly, Germany’s Fidor Bank pioneered the integration of bitcoin as a competitive advantage for the bank when, in July 2013, they agreed to a large-scale partnership with the Bitcoin.de exchange in Munich. The agreement called for a “liability umbrella” for bitcoin trading and represented the first direct banking cooperation in the regulated EU bitcoin sector.  Shortly thereafter, Fidor Bank signed an exclusive arrangement with Payward Ltd, operator of the Kraken bitcoin exchange. Under the deal, Kraken became Fidor Bank’s exclusive digital currency trading platform throughout the European Union, with the exception of Germany where Fidor Bank already had the local partnership with Bitcoin.de.  Turning the tables on owning the bitcoin customer relationship, Fidor Bank CEO Matthias Kröner said: “Digital currencies are emerging as serious and useful alternatives to government-issued currencies. With Kraken we can enable our customers to trade bitcoin and other digital currencies just as securely, easily and flexibly as they trade other foreign currencies today.”  Shifting roles  These are still early days, but it could forecast the beginning of a trend where regional banks take on the role of building online platforms and interfacing with the millions of bitcoin customers.  In this scenario, the banks become local liquidity providers and bitcoin position takers. As the service offerings mature, banks will require a bitcoin trading desk, complete with portfolio-hedging strategies and multiple avenues for two-way liquidity.  Global bitcoin exchanges emerge as bitcoin clearing houses – less retail-oriented and more wholesale-oriented – providing deep liquidity and sophisticated offerings for the local market participants.

42376908,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6gKDN,1392393780,Three Bitcoin Startups Pitch for Funding at Boost VC Demo Day,"Over 100 investors gathered in Menlo Park, California, on Tuesday night (11th February) for the Winter Demo Day organized by incubator Boost VC.  At the event, 17 hopeful startups were pitching their business ideas to the group in order to raise venture capital that would hopefully get the fledgling companies off to a flying start. Among the startups were three new companies with a focus on bitcoin, each with just five minutes to pitch their concept to the potential investors.  Before the demos, Boost founder Adam Draper made a short welcoming speech. He told the audience that the startups had been working hard to create a polished product or service. He joked: “They have not slept in the past few months.""  First in the hotseat was a startup with crowdsourced security as its bright idea.  CrowdCurity  “Everyday, websites are getting hacked,” said Jacob Hansen, one of the co-founders of the startup CrowdCurity, before going on to explain how his team can help that problem go away.  Hansen proposed a concept of “99designs meets IT security” – a reference to the design crowdsourcing site that allows customers to buy logos and graphic art. The IT consulting sector is an expensive business proposition for websites, he went on, and this is especially true for those on a tight budget.  CrowdCurity  has crowdsourced a group of security professionals, who on request will examine the application layer of a website for bugs that could be exploited by hackers.  The current system could be more efficient at turning up security flaws if it provided bug-hunters with a reward incentive, Hansen explained, instead of paying a security consultant for dedicated time seeking out potential weaknesses – as many websites currently have to do.  The idea is to “deliver crowdsourced security as a service,” he continued. The company already has over 20 clients and has signed up over 700 security researchers to the startup’s ‘crowd’.  It’s noteworthy that half of the company’s current business is coming from bitcoin-related clients, representing the gamut of wallets, exchanges and other cryptocoin-focused startups.  Hansen says CrowdCurity wants to “disrupt IT security and end the time of paying expensive security consultants”.  Coincove  Second to pitch at the Demo Day was Tomas Alvarez, a co-founder of startup Coincove. Alvarez said that his company wants to become “the Coinbase of Mexico” and eventually all of Latin America. He told the investors: “Bitcoin adoption is skyrocketing in Mexico and Latin America.”  Being a bitcoin exchange is a change of direction for Coincove. When CoinDesk covered the company a few months back, the plan was to help people send money around the world on the cheap by first exchanging it for bitcoin.  Now it seems the founders have shifted from being a remittance provider to becoming a Latin American cryptocurrency exchange. This may not be such a bad idea, since that company had been focusing on Argentina, which, since it recently devalued its peso, has seen an increase in instability. Perhaps bitcoin will take a boost in the aftermath.  Coincove has a relationship with a bank in Mexico and has registered as a money transmitter in the country. The company will be accepting bank wires, as well as cash deposits, in over 10,000 locations within Mexico.  The startup has also conducting a private beta over the past week or so to test out its platform. The plan is to start as a bitcoin exchange for Mexico, and later to grow into the entire Latin American market.  SnapCard  The third and final bitcoin startup to pitch was retail platform SnapCard, which started its presentation with co-founder Michael Dunworth saying that currently: ""Spending your bitcoin sucks!""  That’s why SnapCard has built a special bookmarklet – a kind of web browser plugin that provides extra functionality – which allows people to spend bitcoin with online retailers that don't currently accept the cryptocurrency.  The SnapCard plugin does the clever stuff at the shopping cart stage of the sale: accepting bitcoin from customers who want to buy, say, a book on Amazon, and paying that retailer in the equivalent amount of fiat currency.  The company has set an ambitious goal to get its ‘pay with SnapCard’ functions on 10,000 merchant sites within the next 18 months. SnapCard is projecting $4.1 million in annualized sales, which could be a value proposition for merchants choosing to work with the company.  With its large volume of sales, SnapCard possesses valuable data about what bitcoin holders like to buy online – information that could prove important for the company’s retailer partnerships.  Bigger ticket items like cars are also becoming a popular way for SnapCard to help people spend their coin, and the company’s tax payment service is another option for enthusiasts to spend their bitcoin. More features are on the way soon, according to SnapCard’s founders.  Providing a Boost  On the back of the programs for the Demo Day, Boost provided investors with a brief explanation of bitcoin and how it works:  Boost VC is based in San Mateo, California – smack-bang in the middle of Silicon Valley. It provides funding, housing and office space for its startups all on the same downtown city block. The company has now accelerated a total of 10 bitcoin companies – the previous class had seven.  Applications for its next class of startups is currently closed, but interested startups should sign up for the incubator’s mailing list for when the cycle starts again.

42376907,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6gKC7,1392387307,"Bitcoin Under Attack, a Lesson in Discretion, and Getting Rich Quick","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 14th February 2014 – a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder.      Your host … John Law.    Knockers cause bitcoin blues  It’s been a rum old week for bitcoin. Legislators are gunning their engines to bring it within regulatory control, the mighty voice of JPMorgan has said that it’s “not very good”, and there seems to be a concerted and multi-pronged attack on exchanges by anonymous hackers.  This last one is the most interesting. It combines a curious and complex flaw in some bitcoin software implementations with a classic denial of service (DoS) attack – having found a weak spot in how bitcoin is transferred, the hackers are pounding away.  You can read all about the flaw; called transaction malleability, it can lead to a unique transaction ID to be changed before it is confirmed on the bitcoin network. The change makes it possible for someone to pretend that a transaction didn’t happen, if all the right conditions are in place.  It’s not a problem with the basic bitcoin mechanism, more a subtle side-effect of poor software – an affected transaction can look like a duplicate from some angles, but not from others. Create a lot of these transactions and flood an exchange with them and the overhead of sorting them out slows things down enormously for everyone. Wham. Denial of service.    DoS attacks have been around since before the Internet, although the early ones were usually unintentional and caused either by faulty software yelling its head off or some fault condition triggering a flood of network traffic that triggered further instances of the fault elsewhere.      More recently, DoS has been the weapon of choice of disaffected activist groups, vandals and organised cybercriminals putting the frighteners on potential victims. There are lots of remedies and larger online organisations are good at fighting DoS, which is why nobody’s succeeded in bringing down the world banking system (not that it needs much help).      Bitcoin exchanges are not larger online organisations, so the response is slower and more uneven. But software will be patched, firewalls reprogrammed, sources of attack packets identified and isolated – and anyway, with the general misery driving the price down, leaving your exchange transactions until later isn't such a bad idea.      As for the other woes? JPMorgan is an apex predator in international finance, and as such one of the organisations that really should be deeply distrustful of bitcoin. Like the movie industry with home video recorders and telephone companies with the Internet, it’s progressing nicely along the path of ridicule, hence alarm and dire warnings, towards adoption and exploitation.      It’ll be far more dangerous for bitcoin’s more revolutionary possibilities when outfits like JPM decide they like it.      Compared to some of the hi-jinks of big finance, whoever’s behind the DoS attacks are rank amateurs.    Market penetration: small but growing    Talking of ranking, bitcoin’s importance is rising with the porn trade.      Online porn is an odd business: John Law has been at many computer industry shows where entire halls were devoted to it, carefully arranged so that everyone could politely pretend not to notice. Even if the leather-clad butler dwarves with silver trays of refreshments were hard to overlook, as it were.      But rest assured, gentle reader. John Law would never stoop so low. Even if it was a hot day in Vegas and he had a thirst that could distort the orbit of Jupiter.      Of course, nobody ever looks at porn either. And when not looking at it, one may well prefer not to leave evidence of such inaction in one’s bank or credit card statements. What could be better for not paying for things you don’t do than something which leaves no trace of what just didn’t happen?      Such entirely imaginary non-activities have led to bitcoin accounting for a very real 10% of revenues at Porn.com, which will most certainly pay for a few people of diminished stature to dish out a stiff drink or two.      Which leads John Law to wonder. What other legal yet embarrassing activities may benefit from the plausible deniability of bitcoin?      The Americans have already OK’d it for donations to political parties, which in these sordid times does indeed feel less savoury than logging in to LlamasInStilettos.com. It could be just the thing to rescue the NME, whose violent unfashionability has just seen its circulation dip below that of The Lady. Or, indeed, the career of Justin Beiber: do you really want that on your iTunes invoice?      Enjoying one’s harmless hobbies free of ridicule is surely the mark of membership in a civilised society. Even if, the lord knows, it is sometimes hard to keep a straight face.    Evolving a path to success    And speaking of alternatives, here is this week’s free gift – an interactive diagram of cryptocurrencies, together with their evolutionary relationship. It looks something like a flower, which is apt given that – ho, ho – it is now possible to buy tulips with bitcoin, something that has given the grown-ups in the posh media a jolly good laugh.      It’s great fun to wander along the petals and explore the hundreds of options. It’s even more fun to use the timeline control, which lets you pick any month between now and 2008 and see what the altcoin universe looked like then.      Paleontologists like to talk about the Cambrian Explosion, the period of time some half a billion years ago when the seas of the world were suddenly populated by a huge number of new species. 2013 was cryptocurrency’s Cambrian age.      For those with a scientific bent, digital money has one huge advantage over prehistoric creatures: you can watch it evolve.      Everything of interest is publicly available, in real time or close to it, just by watching the block chain. Which proof of work works best? What difficulty scalars best fit actual usage patterns? Of the hundreds of coin types out there, most will die. Some will go on for a while. Some will prosper. And some will go on to produce huge evolutionary families of their own.      All of this will take place in the huge ongoing experiment that is modern finance, and can’t help but produce fascinating evidence for what’s actually going on. If John Law had the time, smarts, money and connections, he’d be off building these tools in the sure expectation that at some point, someone will become the Darwin of digital money – and it might as well be him.      After that, someone will become the world’s best genetic engineer for producing the DNA of new altcoin: Satoshi may have been a far-sighted genius, but you can’t beat actual data.      Move over, JPMorgan. A new apex predator is evolving in the turbulent seas of bitcoin’s prehistory and it will eat your lunch.    Just as soon as he’s polished off this gin and tonic. Thank you, Tyrion. A tad more ice, perhaps?  John Law is an 18th century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler.

42422936,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1ymrh,1392381309,Coinbase Offers $10k Prize in New Hackathon Competition,"San Francisco-based bitcoin wallet Coinbase has launched a hackathon contest for developers who want to “create something great” with bitcoin.  The BitHack competition winner will receive a $10,000 prize, while runners up will take home $5,000 and $3,000 respectively. These amounts will then converted into their bitcoin equivalent once the winners have been decided.  Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam said: “Bitcoin is the world's most used alternative currency, and we want to inspire developers to build exciting solutions around it.”  The company is conducting the contest via its Bithackathon website and encourages developers of all nationalities to take part: “Since our app competition is run online, developers from around the world can participate and use our API for new, innovative solutions,” said Ehrsam.  Late last year, Coinbase received $25m of venture capital funding in a round led by Andreessen Horowitz. The company has ambitions to become the Gmail of bitcoin, and its user-friendly interface and US banking partnership give it a competitive advantage over other wallets.  Ehrsam says that Coinbase is specifically looking for unique submissions. The company has interested in “something that is out of the box, both useful and easy to use, and is polished in detail. That's what we're looking for,” according to the co-founder.  Contest winners will need to submit, “an app that excels on all three criteria: creativity, usability, and execution,” said Ehrsam. He added:  “We're excited about great developers all around the world coming up with things no one has ever thought of before.”  The BitHack competition is now open and will close in mid-March. Ehrsam says that Coinbase is leaving open the prospect of running developer contests on a more regular basis: “For now, this is a one-time thing. We're looking forward to seeing how much interest there is for BitHack and then taking it from there,” said Ehrsam.  However, he added that Coinbase could run future contests focused on specific facets of the Coinbase API if things go well: ""There definitely could be if we run additional BitHacks in the future,"" he said.  However, the company wants to foster, not stifle innovation – so Ehrsam is mindful of those implications: “We don't want to limit developers too much,” he said.  A high-level introduction to Coinbase’s mission is available on the BitHack competition website. There is also a guide to getting started with BitHack, along with an outline of the competition's rules. The deadline for submissions is 16th March.

The exchange halted bitcoin withdrawals earlier this week after it was discovered a bot had launched a massive DDoS attack on a number of bitcoin exchanges.  A tweet from the BitStamp this morning read:    Bitstamp & Bitcoin core developers have implemented a solution that passes our preliminary tests and audits. News: http://t.co/azGqiX4hqL      — Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) February 14, 2014    Bitstamp issued the following statement on its site earlier:    Dear Bitstamp clients,      A denial-of-service attack caused us to suspend the processing of Bitcoin withdrawals. Bitstamp, with help from the Bitcoin core developers, has implemented a solution that passes our preliminary tests and audits.    After additional testing, we plan to enable Bitcoin withdraws later today.    Thank you for your understanding!    Best regards,    The Bitstamp team    Nejc Kodrič, CEO of BitStamp, told CoinDesk that the solution his team is using has worked so far, but still needs further testing.  ""Keep in mind that our solution worked on a small amount of transactions in our development environment,"" he said.  Andreas Antonopoulos, chief security officer of Blockchain.info, predicted on Tuesday that it would only take bitcoin exchanges a couple of days to implement solutions to the issues they were facing. He said:  “I would expect to see withdrawals flowing again within 24 and 72 hours, and in the meantime, any withdrawals that were cancelled will reappear in customer account balances.”  It appears he was correct.  The founders of BTC-e told CoinDesk all withdrawals that had been stuck in limbo over the past few days have now been transferred.  ""There are not any issues [with withdrawals at BTC-e], currently everything is working smoothly,"" they said.  The exchange's site has experienced some downtime recently and the founders confirmed this was because of the DDoS attack.  ""The only one issue which is still in process is the DDoS attack. We are working to resolve it as soon as possible. We are working to keep site up until the DDoS attackers will understand that the attack is useless,"" they concluded.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/14/bitstamp-to-resume-bitcoin-withdrawals-today,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/da47407568d5e91d38f75fa9796878a32be9aa79-1000x652.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376896,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6gJyH,1392373345,Watch This Man Confront CEO of Mt. Gox Over Missing Bitcoins,"Something about bitcoin inspires people to jump on airplanes and fly to the other side of the world to protect their wealth. Maybe that's part of bitcoin's 'inherent value'.  Kolin Burges was a software developer in London until the end of last year, when his vast Litecoin holdings suddenly went lunar. Concerned at the prospect of a Chinese New Year crash he moved much of his wealth back to Japan and Mt. Gox, only to find it locked in there around the same week.  Inspired by last week's three-day sit-in protest by Australia's pseudonymous CoinSearcher, Burges bought a last-minute ticket (at the cost of £850) and flew 12 hours from London to Tokyo to see for himself what was happening. He said:  ""They haven't answered anybody's support requests, they seem to have just taken people's money – they've taken my money.""  After arriving in Japan on Wednesday, Burges tried to schedule an appointment with the company's executives, but to no avail. On Friday morning he set up camp outside the Mt. Gox offices in Tokyo’s Shibuya district – despite the freezing temperatures.  At 9.15am he confronted Mt. Gox's CEO Mark Karpeles outside the exchange's front door and demanded to withdraw his coins, but the response was: ""We can't right now."" Burges' next question: ""Do you still have everyone's bitcoins?"" didn't get a response.  Burges admitted that a doorstop challenge would probably be futile, but said the wealth that he has stored in Mt. Gox's servers is definitely worth it. ""If I lose that, my lifestyle will change. I just didn't want to lose that amount of money without a fight,"" he said.  Burges says he'll stay in Tokyo until next week, camping out at Mt. Gox's offices again if necessary.  When he announced his travel and protest plans on Reddit, the response was mixed. While some supported his effort, others said Mt. Gox had already given a credible explanation for the withdrawal problems and should be allowed time to fix them.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | LTC | TECHNOLOGY,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/14/watch-this-man-confront-ceo-of-mt-gox-over-missing-bitcoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9607e474f81f2dfebef94abf991f911452ea7b94-1572x968.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376905,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6gKAr,1392337127,"Mt. Gox Bitcoin Price Sinks to $300, Past its Post-China Low","UPDATE (14th February, 08:35 GMT):  The price of bitcoin on Mt. Gox registered a daily low this morning at 03:00 GMT of $302, but has since rebounded to $383.  ---------------------------------  After a few days of shaky stability, the price of bitcoin continued to fall on 13th February across major exchanges as fear, uncertainty and doubt spread throughout the bitcoin community.  The most direct contributor to the day's decline was the revelation that more than 4,500 BTC were reported stolen from online black market Silk Road 2.0, which failed to adequately respond to transaction malleability issues that were earlier reported by Mt. Gox, Bitstamp and other exchanges.  Message board discussions suggest that fears of a sudden sell-off by the thieves or that the market would dive steeply as it did following the closure of Silk Road in October were the most likely causes of concern, though others disagreed that the event could inspire market movements.  Some community members blamed the escalating bad news from the industry.  Over the last week, bitcoin has seen its most high-profile exchanges experience service issues due to DDoS attacks, a potential major market outlaw the currency and the state of its once-largest exchange Mt. Gox deteriorate, even as it tried to calm users.  Major exchanges see declines  Thursday saw faith in Mt. Gox decline, as prices dropped more than 30% below those observed on other exchanges. The decrease in price suggests that CEO Mark Karpeles' statements to the press have done little to encourage users to keep investing in the exchange.  Data from Bitcoin Charts shows the price reached a low of $451.10 on 13th February, a figure that was less than its 18th December low of $455, when prices nosedived on the news that China, the market then responsible for driving bitcoin price growth, would be severely limited by regulation.  At press time, prices were down across major bitcoin exchanges such as Bitstamp, BTC-e and Mt. Gox, though none saw the same lows as Mt. Gox.  BTC-e's low of $580.10 remained $160 higher than its 18th December low of $420.  Similarly, Bitstamp declined, but observed the highest total among the exchanges - $601.54, nearly double its post-China low of $382.20.  Uncertainty reigns  Speculation as to a central cause of the decline was rampant, though, any one conclusion proved elusive. Rather, the wide variety of negative stories, coupled with the range of reporting may provide the best explanation for why even bitcoin enthusiasts converted BTC for fiat.  For example, TechCrunch reported that as much as 88,000 BTC had been stolen from Silk Road 2, before amending this figure to over 4,000:    Silk Road 2 Hacked, 88,000 Bitcoin Allegedly Stolen http://t.co/CS70uzfxMW by @johnbiggs      — TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) February 13, 2014    Though, it was far from the only source to report varying estimates of the total loss. For example, Forbes suggested that between 41,000 and 88,000 BTC had been initially stolen.  The result was that an increasing number of reddit threads seemed dedicated simply to finding the positive news in light of these recent setbacks.  These commenters chose instead to chose on how many investors are still excited about the bitcoin ecosystem despite its price fluctuations, and that interest in bitcoin continues to rise despite the recent string of negative news.
