42377798,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73blL,1415919720,OneName Raises Seed Funding to Fuel Decentralized Identity Protocol,"Open-source identity protocol provider OneName announced a forward-looking roadmap this week that will see it extend more open-source software to developers as it bids to disrupt the existing online authentication process.  The blog post follows a relative period of quiet for the project, which debuted its social solution for bitcoin addresses this March. Though the Openname tool garnered widespread use in the community, OneName said it now intends to move beyond simply providing a domain name system for bitcoin toward offering an entire suite of tools for online identity.  Perhaps most interestingly, however, was the post's revelation that OneName had recently closed an undisclosed seed round backed by Union Square Ventures. OneName's full list of investors now includes noted bitcoin advocate and SecondMarket chairman Barry Silbert; AngelList CEO and co-founder Naval Ravikant; and San Francisco-based investment firm SV Angel.  However, OneName core developers Muneeb Ali and Ryan Shea stressed in an interview that the funding should be secondary to the company's larger goals.  Ali told CoinDesk:  ""We feel like a lot of our investors are really true believers in creating open-source communities and a large developer platform where everyone can contribute. We don't feel like funding itself is an achievement. It's really about what you're working on.""  Rather, the developers said that both the funding and its product roadmap were announced in tandem to reinforce that OneName will now have the backing it needs to tackle a significant challenge: convincing developers to provide its log-in system over or alongside existing usernames and passwords and alternatives from Google and Facebook.  Core to this vision will be for the developers to continue to build on top of the namecoin protocol, while encouraging the wider community around OneName to grow by inviting others to work on the protocol.  Open Source and Openname Auth  Throughout the interview, Ali and Shea sought to reinforce that OneName's latest announcement differentiates the company from the social networks that are currently serving the online login space it seeks to attack.  OneName intends to be open source with its offering, even when it comes to tools that could be considered products like OpenName.org, which allows users to search a directory of Openname profiles and display the search engine on their website.  This commitment to open source means that OpenName.org will index anyone who has their information stored on the blockchain, even those who don't have profiles with OneName.  ""Someone could be sitting in Australia, using their own client to register themselves, without registering through us, and our search will still index them and they will get included in the search,"" Ali explained.  OpenName Auth, in turn, will seek to provide a password-less authentication option to developers, whose end users may be hesitant about interacting with a third party. The project is currently in development, and is still in the proposal stages.  Application login first  OneName stressed that, while it hopes the initial projects it builds will be more broadly applicable, it is primarily focused on application login. Ali and Shea positioned OneName as different from other proposals, such as the Windhover Principles, which recently saw more than 20 companies in the digital currency space pledge to develop an identity solution aimed at know-your-customer (KYC) compliance.  Rather than interface with any government documents or databases, Shea said OneName isn't focusing on any documentation aimed at proving citizenship.  ""We are looking at it more as probabilistic identity, you connect a bunch of online presences, your Github or your Twitter, and it gives you a sense with a high probability that it is this person, but it's not really verified by a government by a Social Security number,"" Ali added.  However, Shea said that it is not ruling out that the tools it is building today couldn't prove to be the foundation for future projects that solve for KYC identity challenges.  ""Over time we would want it to be extensible to everything,"" he said, ""so you could imagine it being used for something like KYC at some point.""  Multiyear ambitions  Ali and Shea further indicated that they are eager to tap the resources that their new investors can provide. For example, Shea noted that OneName now has access to other bitcoin companies in the space, which could help them better develop a solution that meets their needs.  ""We want to be able to provide software to all the bitcoin companies and help them work with a common protocol around identity,"" Shea said.  The funding will also give the developers the ability to focus on growing the openname protocol without worrying about any short-term business model.  Both and Ali Shea, however, aren't worried about the company's future, arguing that should OneName succeed at building the tools it has planned, a business plan will follow.  ""You can imagine if this thing becomes the missing identity layer of the Internet, then you can figure out how OneName can try to monetize that,"" Ali added.

42377793,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73bf3,1415916047,Coinsetter Offers Company Equity in Bid to Attract Market Makers,"Coinsetter has announced it intends to divide a 10% stake in the company's business among interested market makers who agree to add liquidity to its order book.  The company's newly announced Market Making Equity Incentive Program will require participating market makers to maintain at least $300,000 in holdings with the New York-based exchange. Coinsetter will then partition its corporate equity based on trading volume that can be linked to quotes provided by its market makers.  CEO Jaron Lukasiewicz framed the program as possibly the ""most exciting announcement"" in the company's history, one that would grab the attention of larger hedge funds that may not be swayed by smaller investment opportunities.  However, Lukasiewicz told CoinDesk that he believes the program is also attractive for Coinsetter as it will allow the company to provide a more enticing suite of offers to traders.  ""Our liquidity is hugely valuable to our customers, and ultimately we're trying to double the amount of liquidity we can provide near the top of the book for the companies in the space. Ultimately, that results in less slippage, better pricing and a better, more liquid bitcoin space.""  Lukasiewicz further positioned Coinsetter as one of the only exchanges with a capitalization table necessary to offer equity to exchange participants.  All 10% of Coinsetter's equity stake offering remains unclaimed as of press time, according to the company, which said it does not plan to advertise new entrants into the program.  Strategy necessary for long-term success  Though a novel offering in the bitcoin space, Lukasiewicz explained the equity extension as a tested strategy used by major stock exchanges.  ""We've seen similar things in the equities space, a lot of electronic communications networks (ECNs) have done somewhat similar programs in terms of incentivizing well-capitalized market makers to provide liquidity through equity,"" he said.  Lukasiewicz stressed that, for him, the deal was primarily about ensuring Coinsetter would be able to offer a competitive product for the exchange's current and future customers.  Bitcoin businesses like Circle, he said, will be looking for competitive markets to offload the bitcoin they receive from consumers and require liquidity as a prerequisite to any relationship.  ""Our fundamental belief is that, if you look at the structure behind what we're offering, the core belief is that we can incentivize market makers to make quotes near the top of our book, quotes that aren't available on any other exchange,"" he said.  Liquidity as a top priority  Notably, the news comes during a relative flurry of activity for US-based bitcoin exchanges that are targeting institutional investors and businesses.  Tim Draper-backed bitcoin startup Vaurum, for example, recently rebranded as Mirror as it prepares for its formal launch. Mirror will leverage the nearly 30,000 BTC purchased at auction by Draper to add liquidity to its exchange as it grows internationally.  Further, Buttercoin recently opened its exchange to US businesses and consumers, advertising at the time that an unnamed hedge fund is currently acting as a market maker for its order books.  Lukasiewicz, however, said the exchange is choosing instead to focus on its own goals, and that it intends for the results of its newest program tell the story of its success, concluding:  ""In the end it all comes down to the numbers, and the numbers will be displayed 24/7 on our order book.""

42377803,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73bst,1415910237,Here's How a Dark Market Bot Sent Ecstasy to an Art Gallery,"Last week, a padded envelope was delivered to the Kunst Halle St Gallen, a contemporary art gallery in St Gallen, the city known as the gateway to the Swiss Alps.  The envelope contained a DVD case, which held a vacuum-sealed aluminium foil packet. Inside the packet was a transparent plastic pouch containing 10 yellow tablets stamped with the Twitter logo, a fluttering bird.  The tablets were 'Yellow Twitter' ecstasy pills purportedly made of pure MDMA, the acronym for the compound's chemical name.  The pills were ordered by a shopping bot that paid in bitcoin. It was written by the art group !Mediengruppe Bitnik, called Random Darknet Shopper, that's part of an installation at the gallery.  The pills were added to the installation, where they joined a carton of contraband cigarettes from Moldova and a set of 'masterkeys' that promised to unlock communal gates and storage areas in the United Kingdom.  Random Darknet Shopper is part of an exhibition at the gallery that examines the dark web called, 'The Darknet - From Memes to Onionland. An Exploration'.  Carmen Weisskopf, a co-founder of the art group, told CoinDesk:  ""The idea behind the Random Shopper was to make a direct connection between these darknet shops and the exhibition space [...] We wanted to talk about how trust is built in anonymous networks. We felt it would be most visible in a marketplace, where you need to build trust.""  Random Darknet Shopper has four weeks left to run. It has already purchased eight items off Agora, which it selects randomly, and which have to fit into its weekly $100 bitcoin budget. The bot is programmed to buy one item each week, which it usually does on a Wednesday, Weisskopf said.  Bitcoin has become easier to buy  According to Weisskopf's co-founder, Domagoj Smoljo, the bot is written in Python and is completely automated, with the exception of the human assistance that is required to enter Captcha information that is prompted by Agora upon login.  Obtaining bitcoin – the de facto currency of the darknet markets – has become increasingly easy for the project to do since the group began experimenting with the idea, Smoljo said.  He explained:  ""It's relevant to see how the access to bitcoin has changed in the last three or four months. When we started the experiment, we had to meet people somewhere to exchange currency. It felt like the Balkans in the 90s. Now we have bitcoin ATMs.""  Legal worries  As the installation entered its seventh week at the gallery, it got an unexpected boost in public attention from Operation Onymous, the inter-continental crackdown on illicit darknet markets that saw the seizure of dozens of hidden sites, including Silk Road 2.0.  ""We've had a few newspapers write about the installation ... they focused on the drugs because it's the item that could be seen as illegal. We really don't know what's going to happen now,"" Weisskopf said.  Smoljo said their group had consulted a lawyer before the installation opened to examine the legal and ethical quandaries the installation could provoke. For example, Smoljo said, gallery staff might be required to retrieve deliveries from the post office, putting them at risk of being in possession of illicit drugs.  ""Our lawyer said there is a sort of higher [public] interest reason for arts experiments. Because it is a reality, and I think the arts have a very specific duty to show reality,"" he said.  Not anonymous  The group makes no attempt to hide its identity on the dark markets. Its bot is named 'randomdarknetshopper' and its profile contains a link to information about the installation.  The group's work is inspired by the Mail Art movement of the 1950s and 60s, where artists like Ray Johnson tried to circumvent the commercial exploitation of their work using photocopied images, postcards and a variety of other media, according to the Grove Encyclopaedia of American Art.  A previous piece by the group, called 'system_test', consisted of a videocamera that was mailed to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London. The camera broadcast its movement through the postal system live on the Internet.  ""We used the same methods with this piece. The mail aspect is a lot more tactical. Mail systems still have something called 'postal secrecy' ... we realised that you do not have 'postal secrecy' online,"" Weisskopf said.

42426171,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjQxh,1415905667,HP Survey: 79% of US Organisations Plan to Adopt Digital Currencies,"Digital currencies now feature in the long-term strategies of US businesses, according to a new study of electronic payment trends.  The Ponemon Institute report, commissioned by tech giant hp, found that 79% of respondents planned to support digital currencies like bitcoin in the future.  Additionally, 80% of the 634 US residents surveyed said they expect digital currencies to overtake paper currencies in the future.  The report's authors point out that the participants, primarily working in IT operations, security and technology deployment, are “all familiar with and involved” in their organisations’ electronic payments practices.  In addition to digital currencies, the report also deals with security, authentication systems, emerging technologies, wireless standards such as Near Field Communication (NFC) and mobile services like Apple Pay and Google Wallet.  No shortage of interest in bitcoin  Overall, the report indicates that perceptions of new electronic payment systems are positive and digital currencies have their fair share of support.  Looking at the take-up of bitcoin generally, the report asked: Does your organization support or plan to support a virtual currency innovative electronic payment solution (such as bitcoin)?  In total 79% of respondents replied yes, although the majority planned to do so more than a year from now. Fourteen per cent had already adopted digital currency, and 20% planned to within the next six to 12 months.  While digital wallets proved to be popular, respondents expressed concerns about security risks. Indeed, the single biggest barrier to adoption of innovative payments technologies is security, the report says.  The report concludes that widespread adoption of digital currencies is “inevitable” because both companies and consumers are willing to embrace them.  In total, 60% of respondents said digital currencies are an important part of their organisation’s electronic payment strategy, with 26% saying they ""strongly agree"" with that statement.  Respondents were particularly bullish on mobile payments and 75% confirmed their organisations plan to offer support for mobile payments in the near future, while 59% said they will integrate support for stored value cards.  Digital currencies came in third, with 43% of respondents saying they will play a part in their mobile payment strategy.  Long-term optimism  When asked whether digital currencies will overtake paper currencies in the future, the majority of respondents said yes.  Most expect this to occur within 5-10 years and only 20% of those surveyed said this would never happen.  A similar trend is visible in digital wallets, but respondents expect adoption to be somewhat faster.  24% said they would adopt digital wallets over the next two years, while a further 56% said they would do so over a 5-10 year period.  For the time being, support for digital currencies remains limited. Just 14% of respondents said their organisations support digital currencies already.  Interest is picking up, however. 11% of respondents said they plan to integrate support over the next 6 months, while 9% expect integration over the next 12 months.  Many of those surveyed (45%) said their organisations intend to roll out support for digital currencies more than a year from now, while 21% said there were no plans for support.  When asked how important the acceptance of paperless or virtual currencies (such as bitcoin) is to their organisation’s innovative electronic payment strategy, 40% of respondents said it was essential, while 43% described it as ""very important"".  Only 11% described digital currency integration as ""somewhat important"", followed by 6% of respondents who said it was not important. None of the respondents described it as ""irrelevant"".  Security challenges remain a big concern  New payment models also bring new security challenges and most respondents said one-time passwords or tokens will be the most important approaches, followed by federated identity and authentication systems and multi-factor authentication.  Digital currencies are associated with a number of specific security concerns that may or may not affect other forms of payment.  When asked whether the acceptance of digital currencies would increase or decrease the security and integrity of electronic payments, the majority of respondents said it would result in a decrease.  The majority (42%) said they expect a decrease, while 41% said digital currencies would result in a ‘significant decrease’.  Just 2% expect a significant increase and an additional 5% expect an increase, while 10% said digital currency adoption would have no impact on security.  It should be noted that these concerns are not limited to digital currencies, as most respondents also said digital wallet integration would have a negative effect on security.  Digital wallets fared somewhat better than digital currencies, but 34% of respondents still said they would bring a 'significant decrease' in security, while 37% said they expect a decrease.

42426162,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjQhh,1415894410,Yacuna Launches No-Verification Bitcoin Buying for Crypto Novices,"UK cryptocurrency exchange Yacuna has launched a website that aims to remove the hassle of trading for newcomers who want to buy cryptocurrencies quickly and easily.    Selling bitcoin, dogecoin and litecoin, YacunaDirect is a user-friendly platform designed to appeal to a broad international audience, including traditional traders and finance professionals, who may not yet have experimented with digital currencies.  The firm acts as a broker and lets users buy cryptocurrencies at a fixed price, rather than having to navigate the ups and downs of a live exchange.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Andrei Martchouk, CEO of the Yacuna Group, framed the new bitcoin shop as a way to make cryptocurrency more accessible and convenient for regular consumers.  He said:    “Many of our customers told us they'd like to purchase bitcoins directly. They want to buy cryptocurrencies instantly, without sign-ups or verification processes and spend them directly for other goods. We are the first exchange to integrate this kind of service in our business.”            How it works    YacunaDirect currently allows users to purchase their coins with fiat payments made via SOFORT Banking. Notably, there is no registration process requiring ID and proof of address.      After specifying how much cryptocurrency is required and entering digital wallet and email addresses, users are taken to the payments page where bank account details are taken via SOFORT.      Customers receive their cryptocurrency within 12 hours of the payment confirmation, the company says.    Purchase limit    The lack of a user registration process means there is a limit on how much cryptocurrency a person can purchase per day.      ""In order to allow a frictionless shopping experience, we allow our customers to purchase the supported cryptocurrencies up to a limit of €100,"" said Martchouk. ""Of course you can purchase more than that with YacunaDirect, however it will require a registered account with Yacuna.com ... We're setting this limit to comply with the EU-regulation on e-money services.""      Additionally, while SOFORT currently accepts bank payments from seven European countries via the site, it currently does not have an option for UK customers.      Martchouk said: ""This is being fixed. The UK is supported by our payments partner and we are in the last stages of contract discussions.""

42426151,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjQLh,1415888660,Richard Branson Backs Digital Currency Ahead of Australia Summit,"Sir Richard Branson has voiced his support for bitcoin ahead of the Global Digital Currency Conversation (GDCC) forum in Brisbane, Australia, this Sunday.  The GDCC is due to coincide with this year's G20 Summit on 16th–17th November, at the close of the G20 event. Organisers say it aims to facilitate discussion and ""formalise a global agreement on digital currencies"" before Turkey's G20 conference in 2015.  Branson, a prominent bitcoin advocate, first announced his support for the Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association (ADCCA), the industry group behind the conference, late last month.  Opposing views on regulation  Through his Virgin.com blog post, titled How Digital Currency Could Transform the World, Branson maintains a neutral stance on bitcoin regulation.  He praises the ADCCA and its chairman Ron Tucker for their work on the regulatory front, pointing out that there is still work to be done on the thorny issue of 'best practice' regulations.  While some bitcoin proponents argue in favour of a self-regulatory model, there are also a number of arguments in favour of a “centrally governed rulebook”, he says.  Branson also explains how he thinks bitcoin could disrupt and improve traditional payment platforms:  “It’s important to note that while the established online payment systems will be disrupted by bitcoin, it also has a lot to gain from bitcoin’s presence. Services will be given the opportunity to make themselves more responsive and price competitive, who wouldn’t want to offer that to their customers?”  He concludes that the technology has the potential to lower costs and increase convenience, while the G20 Summit offers a “great opportunity to keep the conversation around digital currencies going”.  “Making sure that conversations around this are happening at the highest level will hopefully result in common sense reforms to areas such as taxation and law enforcement, which will be of real benefit to all concerned.”  Why bitcoin?  The entrepreneur also elabourated on why he decided to back several companies involved in the digital currency space:  “I have invested in bitcoin because I believe in its potential, the capacity it has to transform global payments is very exciting. It has been obvious to us all for quite some time that people aren’t satisfied with the business as usual approach adopted by the major payment networks.”  He added that he hopes to become a part of the financial “democratisation” by investing in companies like Square and Blockchain. Bitcoin payment processor BitPay also received funding from Branson earlier this year.  The Virgin Group founder has come out in favour of bitcoin on several occasions, most recently in an interview with Bloomberg.  While there is a desire for more control, freedom and scrutiny over what happens with people’s money, Branson warns that bitcoin is not without its foibles:  “While many of us are excited about the possibilities Bitcoin has to offer, I’m not sure any of us would argue that it comes without problems.”  Richard Branson image via Prometheus72 / Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/11/13/richard-branson-backs-digital-currency-ahead-of-australia-summit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bfd46649dfbcc48c9858eac63d6dba73757bff4b-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426163,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjQfh,1415879096,Counterparty Ignites Debate With Ethereum Software Integration,"Counterparty sparked debate in the bitcoin community yesterday when it announced it had successfully ported open-source software from the Ethereum project to its platform, equipping it with new functionality.  The decentralized peer-to-peer exchange provider framed the announcement as one that would soon bring all the potential of Ethereum's as-yet-unlaunched smart contract system to its platform, while providing the added security of the bitcoin blockchain and its established global mining network.  Counterparty  chief architect Adam Krellenstein indicated the move aimed to satisfy widespread demand for a viable smart contract platform, while appealing to those skeptical that such a system requires a new blockchain with an untested mining network or a new native token.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Ethereum is an ambitious project for which I have great admiration, and what we've done today wouldn't have been possible without their hard work and innovation.""  ""I think they're all very excited for a smart contract platform and people are rightfully skeptical that you need a new blockchain and a new coin and we're arguing that you don't,"" he added.  By contrast, Ethereum CCO Stephan Tual sought to downplay Counterparty's statements that its platform would now provide similar functionality as its offering as premature.  ""This shows a continued lack of understanding by other platforms (XCP, Blockstream) of what Ethereum actually is and aims to achieve,"" he said, before reiterating Ethereum's stance that it is a web 3.0 platform.  Though its technology has yet to meet the market, Ethereum has also garnered enthusiasm in the bitcoin community, raising $15m–$18m through a crowdsale of its native token, ether.  Launched in January, Counterparty quickly gained momentum in the market, with two of its developers notably joining Overstock's planned decentralized stock exchange project, Medici.  Counterparty has a live testnet of its Ethereum smart contract system available today, and hopes to make the full version public ahead of Ethereum's planned launch next spring.  Unlocking new potential  Throughout the interview, Krellenstein asserted that Ethereum is both a smart contract system and a new blockchain. However, these two systems can work independently of one another – as evidenced by Counterparty's latest move.  As such, he framed Counterparty's decision to implement Ethereum's smart contract system as one that would provide the wider crypto-development community with more choices should they seek to utilize this functionality for new projects.  Counterparty already features assets, digital tokens and derivatives, among other offerings. Now, according to Krellenstein, users will be able to create everything from family trusts to the decentralized applications Ethereum is currently building on Counterparty.  ""Because this is Turing complete you'll be able to do anything on it,"" he said. ""You'll be able to add namecoin in a couple lines. You can run the Counterparty client, write the namecoin code, you publish it and then anyone can use that namecoin functionality on the bitcoin blockchain with zero security issues.""  As for whether the launch was collaborative, Krellenstein said that he had previously spoken with Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin about Counterparty porting Ethereum's code.  ""It was independent but with their blessing,"" Krellenstein said, adding:  ""It's totally open-source software and its all free to use for everyone. We're glad for Ethereum to use any of our code or our ideas for their platform.""  Embracing competition  Though Ethereum released public statements on the matter, it contained most of its public response on Reddit, where co-founders Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin shared their thoughts with the community.  Buterin framed the integration as a validation of the Ethereum project and its ideas, many of which he said were not initially taken seriously by the wider bitcoin community.  ""Quoth one of our team members,"" Buterin wrote, ""it went from 'Ethereum is not possible' to 'sidechains will kill Ethereum' to 'we copied Ethereum'.""  The developer went on to suggest that ultimately Ethereum will provide a more compelling smart contract solution should it succeed at reducing block times to 12 seconds, a figure it has suggested the project will strive to achieve.  Further, he emphasized that all competition between projects should be looked at in terms of how their results could realize the blockchain's true innovations.  ""All I'll say is that it's definitely good for the sector to have all models exist in all implementations (metacoin, sidechain, independent coin, contract inside Ethereum, contracts inside an Ethereum-like metacoin), so we can see how the scalability plays out.""  Elsewhere, Ethereum community members pointed to the problems Ethereum's blockchain is designed to avoid, including bloating the bitcoin blockchain.  Though amicable, both sides used the event to air differences between their platforms with sometimes pointed remarks. For example, Lubin compared Counterparty's approach to running Netflix on an email protocol.  ""You could maybe do it, but why would you want to? And certainly the user experience would be awful,"" he said.  Enabling developer choice  Bitcoin developer Peter Todd, who has previously worked on Counterparty and Mastercoin alongside his own development solution, treechains, said the news doesn't position one project above the other.  Rather, he said, developers who want to enable smart contracts simply get to select from a set of pros and cons before choosing to work with Counterparty or Ethereum.  ""It becomes a set of trade offs for security and cost,"" he added. ""Embedding stuff on the bitcoin blockchain can be more expensive because of the transaction fees. Also you need to run, at least currently, a full Counterparty node. But that's a set of trade-offs for some very good security, as you get all the transactions exchanged on the bitcoin blockchain.""  Daniel Peled, the lead developer at Gems, a social messaging service running on top of the Counterparty protocol, said he believes it is too early to say what the long-term implications of Counterparty's move would be.  Peled said this is simply the latest news event that has showcased the debate of whether its better for developers to build on top of bitcoin or another new blockchain.  ""Most people who like Ethereum are comfortable with it being on a new blockchain,"" he said. ""That is the whole point, to solve [bitcoin's] slow confirmation block time and high fees that make it difficult for smart contracts and some appcoin models.""  Mastercoin CTO Craig Sellars struck a more optimistic tone, adding:  ""Anything that pushes innovation forward through honest competition is something of which I am in great favor, especially where credit is given to the original idea and where those new contributions can be shared among and improved upon by the idea makers in the community.""  Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Counterparty had yet to release any code for its testnet. The code can be found here.
