42385310,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAqNAB,1607724905,FinCEN Encourages Banks to Share Customer Information With Each Other,"A U.S. agency that fights financial crime is encouraging financial institutions, ranging from banks to cryptocurrency exchanges, to share customer information with one another to catch wrongdoers.      The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the Treasury Department, issued a fact sheet Thursday spelling out that the 2001 Patriot Act gives institutions wide latitude in what kind of information they are permitted to share.      Overall, the sheet seemingly lowers the obstacles for further sharing of personal customer information among banks, the threshold of what qualifies as “suspicious” activity and whether the entities sharing customer information even need to be financial institutions.      Among other matters, the fact sheet clarifies that Section 314(b) of the act, and the regulations putting it into practice, “impose no limitations on the sharing of personally identifiable information.” The sheet added that institutions have to protect the security and confidentiality of this data, and use it only for the purposes laid out in the nearly 20-year-old law, passed a month after the 9/11 attacks.      Still, the guidance is likely to chafe privacy advocates inside and outside the crypto community who are already uneasy about the honeypot of personal data that FinCEN’s suspicious activity report (SAR) database has become. The more places information is shared, after all, the more ways it can be misused or stolen.      “It seems that in the spirit of ‘protecting our communities and preventing crimes and bad acts,’ FinCEN's guidance is dramatically expanding its expectation of banks to share data, at the expense of individuals’ privacy, while potentially exposing them to very real cyber risks, when it is not clear that such a move is necessary,” said Nizan Geslevich Packin, an associate professor of law at City University of New York.      In a speech Thursday, FinCEN Director Kenneth Blanco framed interbank data sharing as a public safety measure.      “Information sharing among financial institutions through 314(b) is critical to identifying, reporting and preventing crime and bad acts,” he said in prepared remarks for a virtual gathering of bankers and lawyers. “It is an important part of how we protect our national security.”      However, he suggested institutions have been reluctant to take part.      “Many have been calling for clarity in this area for a long time,” so the agency saw fit “to clarify in greater detail the circumstances where 314(b) applies, with the hope of enhancing participation,” Blanco said.    Lowering the bar    The information that can be shared is not limited to activities suspected of involving proceeds of a specified unlawful activity (SUA), Blanco said.      Institutions do not need “specific information that these activities directly relate to proceeds of an SUA, or to have identified specific proceeds of an SUA being laundered” in order to share data with each other, he said. Nor must they have made “a conclusive determination that the activity is suspicious.”      The FinCEN fact sheet claims additional reporting can shed “more light upon overall financial trails” and build “a more comprehensive and accurate picture of a customer’s activities that may involve money laundering or [where] terrorist financing is suspected.”      Angela Angelovska-Wilson, co-founder of DLx Law and former chief legal and compliance officer at blockchain software firm Digital Asset, recognized that while multiple financial entities handling sensitive data could create additional vulnerabilities, it may ultimately be a positive.      If banks can share data about what might be suspicious among each other, it could stop some entities from acting with blinders on, she argued. For example, if someone is engaging in one kind of activity in a certain account, and then behaving differently in another, that might seem suspicious to both banks. But if they communicate about this data before filing a SAR, it could benefit the customer as a more holistic picture of their financial activities could illuminate that they’re not doing anything suspicious.      ""Basically what 314(b) has done in the past is it has hampered people's ability to share information in order to figure out whether or not something is actually suspicious and be able to thoughtfully report to FinCEN,"" said Angelovska-Wilson.      Yet others read FinCEN's continued efforts to widen the information-snagging net as a sign of policy failure.      ""This shows that Congress has not been performing its oversight function,"" said Michael German, a former FBI special agent, privacy expert and a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice. ""It's waiting for the Treasury Department to claim that this is an effective measure against terrorism or money laundering. But after two decades of increased sharing of suspicious activity reports, it has not resulted in measurable successes against terrorism or money laundering. It's time for our elected representatives to protect our data, the way that is promised under the Bank Secrecy Act, rather than these exceptions for sharing.""      FinCEN, he said, ""is only going to keep pushing for more information and more information, even if that information is useless to its stated goals.""    Don't tell a soul    Financial institutions are still forbidden to disclose that a SAR exists, and that applies even when the report was filed jointly with another company, FinCEN's fact sheet stated.      “However, financial institutions participating in Section 314(b) that are considering filing or have filed a joint SAR may freely discuss the prospective or already filed joint SAR [among] themselves,” the fact sheet said.      While crypto exchanges aren’t explicitly listed, money services businesses and securities brokers are. Both categories include cryptocurrency businesses.      Compliance vendors and associations of financial institutions, including unincorporated ones governed by a contract between members, are also permitted to take part in information-sharing, FinCEN added.      ""The big takeaway from this seems to be that FinCEN is encouraging people to engage in more data sharing,"" said Michael Yaeger, a shareholder at the law firm of Carlton Fields, who focuses on government investigations and cybersecurity matters. ""They are doing so in a variety of ways, including pointing out that a financial institution does not need to have made a conclusive determination that activity is suspicious or closely tied to a specified unlawful activity. An institution need not have concluded a SAR must be filed.""      As CoinDesk reported Thursday, over the years there has been a move toward so-called defensive filing, meaning that if there is any question something could be deemed suspicious, banks are encouraged to file a SAR.      This has led to what one compliance officer called an “avalanche of data” because financial institutions have been filing more and more to FinCEN.      “Many questions about the safety of the information collected by FinCEN, as well as the bureau's failure to provide clear guidelines regarding how and when it eventually deletes the data it has, remain unanswered,” Packin said. “This is concerning ... in an era in which cybersecurity [has] become a major concern.”      Read more: How FinCEN Became a Honeypot for Sensitive Personal Data",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,"Benjamin Powers, Nikhilesh De, Marc Hochstein",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/12/11/fincen-encourages-banks-to-share-customer-information-with-each-other,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4d21bfe590e430a9e00fa74e851a9e8926bba33d-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385331,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAqNVZ,1607722131,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Holding at $18K; Active Ethereum Addresses up 140% in 2020,"Bitcoin is struggling to make gains as an expected low-volume weekend could push price further down. Meanwhile, the increasing number of active Ethereum addresses this year is a testament to the network’s growth.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $18,019 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 2% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $17,593-$18,404 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC slightly above its 10-hour moving average but below the 50-hour on the hourly chart, a sideways signal for market technicians.    The price of bitcoin fell to as low as $17,593 Friday, according to CoinDesk 20 data. The price has recovered somewhat, hovering around $18,000 territory, and was at $17,962 as of press time.      Read More: Bitcoin Whales Buy Low, Sell High; Retail Investors Chase Rallies: Data      “BTC looks like it lost momentum,” said Misha Alefirenko, co-founder of VelvetFormula, a digital asset liquidity provider. “If buyers are not stepping in soon, we may see a testing of the $16,400-$16,900 range over the weekend.”      Friday is shaping up to be a better day in terms of volume at over $1 billion total for the eight major exchanges tracked by the CoinDesk 20 as of press time. Thursday’s figure was $965 million. However, weekends almost always have lower volume, such as last weekend’s $578 million daily average, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      “It’s a fairly balanced market at the moment, with the fresh inflows from institutional money met with profit taking from some existing large players as well as increased miners' hedging,” noted Jean-Marc Bonnefous, partner at investment firm Tellurian Capital.      Read More: MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin-Driven Offering Boosted to $650M      The derivatives market is also a factor, according to Bonnefous. “There is a big concentration around the $16,000 strike for the BTC options expiry on 25th December, which acts as a polarizing target short term,” he said. The $16,000 strike is the third-most popular strike point in the bitcoin options market, based on data from aggregator Skew.      “We are now seeing public companies like MicroStrategy using leverage to acquire a larger position in bitcoin,” said Michael Gord, chief executive officer of quant crypto firm Global Digital Assets.      December doldrums may continue, but many analysts are hyped up about bitcoin’s potential in 2021. “Next year, as annual budgets reopen, I expect a huge surge in demand to enter the industry from enterprises and institutional investors,” Global Digital Asset’s Gord said.      “Macro matters and, in particular, risks surrounding Brexit may rattle equity markets and result in the U.S. dollar potentially strengthening,"" said Denis Vinokourov, head of research for crypto brokerage Bequant. Equity markets are down globally Friday on some macroeconomic uncertainty.    Asia’s Nikkei 225 closed in the red 0.40%, led lower by losses in SoftBank Group, which fell 4.7% in Japan on Friday.  The FTSE 100 in Europe ended the day slipping 0.80% as Brexit negotiations closed in on a key deadline, leaving investors to sell on the uncertainty.  The S&P 500 in the United States dipped 0.13% as investors remain unsure regarding the potential for government stimulus to help boost the economy.    “But given bitcoin and broader digital assets this year in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic and U.S. elections, expect bitcoin to show a similar amount of resilience,” added Vinokourov.    Ethereum active addresses uptrend in 2020    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Friday, trading around $548 and slipping 3.1% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      The number of active addresses on the Ethereum network has increased to 379,249 as of Dec. 10 from 158,039 on Jan. 1, a 140% increase.      Bequant’s Vinokourov told CoinDesk this data, in addition to metrics showing the movement of Ethereum users from centralized exchanges (CeFi) to decentralized exchanges (DeFi), is a huge liquidity opportunity for token economies within that ecosystem.      Read More: This One Graph Shows Ether Going From CeFi to DeFi: Glassnode      “The amount of gas fees spent on ETH deposits to centralized exchanges has fallen to less than 1%, as of Dec. 9, from around 26% in late October 2017, according to Glassnode data,” Vinokourov noted. “There is plenty of liquidity in the market. As such, DeFi tokens look particularly attractive even with the recent downside.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly red Friday. Notable winners as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):    cosmos (ATOM) + 2.6%  kyber network (KNC) + 1.1%    Notable losers:    stellar (XLM) - 5.1%  litecoin (LTC) - 4.4%  chainlink (LINK) - 4.3%    Commodities:    Oil was down 0.82%.

And now the non-fungible token (NFT) game is hosting a series of raffles to reward early adopters ahead of its mainnet launch next month.      But what do these pixelated little ghosts do?      In short, each Aavegotchi is a playable avatar that represents DeFi collateral that is earning yield on Aave. That said, you can also battle the spooky little critters, level them up and equip them with wearables that change traits. As for the ghost theme, that’s because “aave” means ghost in Finnish.      Since an Aavegotchi represents locked assets, its owner can liquidate the underlying stake at any time. But in doing so the Aavegotchi will disappear. So it’s a test to see what happens to playability when characters have real value beyond their gaming value.      Do you keep the NFT? Or would you rather have the crypto assets it represents?    Summoning Aavegotchi with aTokens    Users can summon an Aavegotchi by staking specific aTokens into their desired gotchi. aTokens (for example, aUSDC, aLINK, etc.) are interest-bearing tokens pegged 1:1 to the value of the underlying crypto asset that is deposited in the Aave protocol.      “We wanted to build a game around aTokens because of how intuitive their benefits are,” explained Coder Dan, Aavegotchi’s pseudonymous co-founder and CEO. “For instance, if you hold 1,000 aUSDC in your wallet now, you will likely find a higher balance in your wallet next time you look. That’s because the interest accrues natively in your wallet, in real time.”      Read more: The Inevitable Marriage of Yield Farming and NFTs      There are two ways to acquire aTokens. Users can visit Aave and deposit tokens as collateral into the Aave protocol or they can swap other Ethereum-based assets for aTokens on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap.    Non-whales welcome    The team behind Aavegotchi is building the game with Aave’s DeFi platform at its heart but it’s also incorporating the latest Chainlink oracles to create a fully on-chain experience – especially with provably random distributions.    On Tuesday, Aavegotchi rolled out its second of three NFT raffleshttps://www.aavegotchi.com/raffle using Chainlink’s random number generator to “level the playing field” for smaller investors. (In other gamified DeFi experiments, large holders tend to win.)    “We love whales, we want whales,” Aavegotchi founder Jesse Johnson told CoinDesk in a call, referring to those holding large numbers of tokens. “But at the same time, it’s nice for normal, retail-type people to play the game by holding GHST tokens in smaller amounts. And also have the chance to win high-end items.”      This raffle, which ended today, featured superhero-themed wearables for mainnet Aavegotchi to become “Aavevengers.”      “Everything we’ve done at this point is not the actual game, but all things leading up to it,” Johnson explained. “You’re not winning wearables, but vouchers to claim wearables once the game launches.”      Just like tickets, the Vouchers can be traded on OpenSea or other NFT marketplaces. Johnson said these raffles are really just a stress test and community-building exercise.    Mainnet launching on Aave V2    The Aavegotchis were set to arrive around the end of 2020 via the first “Haunt” but that date was pushed back so the game could be “Aave V2–made from day one,” Johnson said.      Version 2 of the protocol launched last week.      Read more: Aave Launches V2 in Bid to Make Borrowing Against Volatile Assets Less Risky      This “haunt” has 10,000 Portal NFTs available, with each one being able to summon one Aavegotchi. Portals can be purchased with the GHST governance token.      Once a portal opens, 10 gotchis will be randomly generated, each with its own trait scores (brain size, spookiness, aggression, energy, etc.) and required collateral type. From the 10, only one Aavegotchi can be summoned and the other nine will fade away, forever lost to the ether.      In fact, the portal itself is an NFT, so users also have the option of reselling the Portal (with all 10 potential choices available) on an NFT marketplace like OpenSea.      “We expect them to sell very quickly, if it’s anything like when our GHST token launched where 6 million dai flowed in in about three minutes,” Johnson said. “So we expect people to buy these 10,000 portals in batches of, say, 50.”    A fully realized crypto pet    Further down the road, an open-world metaverse called The Realm will launch where Aavegotchis will populate as first-gen crypto pets.      “It’s important to us that owners be incentivized to interact with their Aavegotchis,” said Johnson. “Too many first-gen crypto pets quickly become neglected and are collecting dust in wallets, and that doesn’t really live up this idea of a fully realized crypto pet.”      Within this world, Aavegotchi’s will be able explore on digital land, gather in the town square for votes and access an array of minigames. Comparable metaverses would include the Sandbox or Decentraland.      “Imagine your gotchis running around in a top-down, 2D classic Zelda game,” said Johnson.      Such is the way of making DeFi fun.",POSITIVE,LINK,AAVE | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | LINK | MINING,Doreen Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/12/11/defi-game-aavegotchi-preps-for-jan-4-mainnet-launch-with-nft-auctions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e2f412cc1aec1faeb8bbc3c149e0db6b9f05c9b1-1080x697.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42405555,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeNPOd,1607716964,Dispute Resolution Protocols Can Help Enterprise Adopt Blockchain,"As we approach the end of 2020, the blockchain industry is experiencing another resurgence. Bitcoin prices are hovering around all-time highs, decentralized finance, or DeFi, is exploring new offerings seemingly every week and tech stalwarts such as PayPal are integrating crypto into their offerings.      These developments are positive news as we continue our efforts to build out the infrastructure of the future. They also surface areas of design and development in which we need to conduct additional research.    Stephanie Hurder, a CoinDesk columnist, is a founding economist at Prysm Group, an economic advisory focused on the implementation of emerging technologies, and an academic contributor to the World Economic Forum. She has a PhD in Business Economics from Harvard.    This week, along with partners at the World Economic Forum and Latham & Watkins LLP, we published the report “Bridging the Governance Gap: Dispute Resolution for Blockchain-Based Transactions.”      While more and more projects have invested in research and development related to governance, the area of dispute resolution, particularly for on-chain transactions, has been less frequently addressed. Focusing on enterprise applications and examining examples across industries, the report details the economic and legal importance of dispute resolution and presents a framework for types of dispute resolution systems.      The four types are:    Private In-Network Resolution, in which disputes are resolved by the network operator or a committee of a network  Private In-Network Resolution, in which disputes are resolved by the network operator or a committee of a network  Semi-Private Industry Fora, in which disputes are resolved by industry participants who may participate in resolving other disputes  Litigation, in which disputes are resolved in court in the applicable legal system    Common to all of these models of dispute resolution is that individuals, with varying degrees of expertise, will need to be involved in adjudicating the disputes. These individuals can be members of the network itself, industry participants or participants in the legal system with jurisdiction.      The reason for this is an economic concept called contractual incompleteness. In any agreement or contract there are circumstances that cannot be anticipated and accounted for in the initial design. When these events take place, participants may not know what to do or they may want to renegotiate and determine a new course of action.      What this means for blockchain projects is the initial protocol or project code is never going to be a complete and comprehensive specification of what should occur in every circumstance. Unanticipated events and upgrades will need to be addressed by people.    As complexity increases, the impact of contractual incompleteness will only increase over time.    These types of unanticipated unknowns are also what drive the need for governance. As we have seen this year in DeFi, projects that attempt entirely new endeavors frequently face hacks and unexpected events.      According to Prysm Group analysis, as of June 2020 over 5% ($50 million) of the $1 billion locked in DeFi projects at the time had been compromised by hacks and other unanticipated platform exploits. Since then, as the total value locked in DeFi projects has grown almost 15 times, projects have continued to be compromised via technical and economic hacks, ranging from re-entrancy to oracle manipulation. In each of these cases, the stakeholders of projects had to work among themselves and with others to diagnose the problem, propose upgrades and re-evaluate depending on unpredictable results in ways that they did not anticipate needing to do.      See also: Stephanie Hurder - The Fourth Era of Blockchain Governance      While blockchain projects are technical innovations, they are also economic ones. Studies such as the World Economic Forum report can show us that ultimately, at least for now, systems will perform better with pre-specified, designated places to include human judgment. The report highlights the importance of including dispute resolution as a core element of enterprise blockchain projects.      Will blockchain outgrow or evolve out of the need for governance and dispute resolution? Most likely not. As blockchain as an industry matures and design improves, projects are also growing more interdependent. Taking DeFi as an example, lending and trading products almost always rely on multiple layers of lent and borrowed existing tokens and protocols as the collateral for their own products. These interdependencies make it more difficult to anticipate all potential events that can occur and predict the trickle-down impacts of an unexpected shock to a single entity in the industry.      As complexity increases, the impact of contractual incompleteness will only increase over time. Anticipating all the ways that an ecosystem of complex protocols and systems may interact – and misfire – will only be more difficult. And, at least for the foreseeable future, the only solution to alleviate this is systems such as governance and dispute resolution, which apply good old human judgment.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Stephanie Hurder,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/12/11/dispute-resolution-protocols-can-help-enterprise-adopt-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/40c9fceff072668e47e66731be6c22b8ccdf940b-1420x951.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The full-service digital asset shop must clear a series of minor regulatory hurdles before it can secure the trust charter necessary to do business, President Michael McCarty said. He said the process would likely wrap up in weeks.      Once it does, Aegis will become the latest digital asset custodian with a foothold in Sioux Falls. BitGo and Anchorage both base their operations in the trust company-friendly city. But while those industry stalwarts cater mostly to the cryptocurrency custody market, Aegis, already partnered with a Hong Kong custodian, is looking to broader opportunities in digitized finance.      McCarty offered international supply chain financing as one target industry. Aegis would custody the contracts involving factories, companies, suppliers and banks, ""digitize those and put them out for investment,"" he said. Stored in Aegis' offline custody wallet, these digital assets could raise working capital for the owners with outstanding invoices.      For example: financing the supply chain of Amazon-sold goods. Raw materials from China have a long way to go before cashing out as a finished product, even if their suppliers need capital fast. Traditional financing allows them to meet their financial obligations. With blockchain, McCarty hopes to make that process more transparent and secure.      ""We're really a full-stack custodian and digitization platform,"" he said. ""Because we have relationships with several financial institutions here in the United States as well as in Taiwan and in Hong Kong, we can serve as a global market.""      Trust company status would allow Aegis to custody U.S. investors ""traditional assets"" at home while giving them opportunities in digitized trade finance abroad, he said.

42405545,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeNPPc,1607709517,Privacy Coin Advocates Persevere Amid Multiple Crypto Exchange Delistings,"On Dec. 8, Dutch cryptocurrency exchange LiteBit sent an email to its users stating it would be delisting the privacy coin firo (formerly zcoin).      According to the email, the decision was made “partly due to the privacy aspect of this crypto. The regulator of crypto companies in the Netherlands has indicated that cryptocurrencies aimed at privacy are too high a risk.”      LiteBit confirmed zcoin will be delisted on Dec. 22.      This news comes a few months after ShapeShift delisted monero, zcash and dash. South Korea-based exchange Bithumb also dropped monero in June, continuing a trend of delisting privacy coins by cryptocurrency exchanges that seems unlikely to stop anytime soon.      “At the moment, the impact is primarily limited to smaller or regional exchanges” said Firo project steward Reuben Yap. “However, it signals to the rest of the space that delisting is the only way to remain compliant with AML/KYC [know your customer/anti-money laundering], which isn’t the case at all, setting a bad precedent.”    Delisting around the world    Yap said delistings have become a worldwide trend, especially in Asian countries such as South Korea and Japan. Europe, where privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) would seem more open to privacy-focused coins, has seen France’s finance committee recommending bans on privacy coins. Recently, new Dutch AML regulations have created perceived barriers for privacy coins, focusing on knowing who are all parties in a cryptocurrency transaction. Monero has already been delisted in the Netherlands.      In Australia, cryptocurrency exchanges are delisting privacy coins amid regulatory and banking pressure. The blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis is believed to have played a large part in the decisions made by Australia and others.      The U.S. Secret Service has urged Congress to create ways to limit the use of privacy-focused cryptocurrencies.      “Delisting is one of the easiest responses for small, compliant cryptocurrency exchanges,” said Justin Ehrenhofer, a Monero contributor. “They may not have the resources to properly communicate their risk mitigation strategies to regulators and banks.”      In most cases, banks, exchanges and other entities find it simpler to completely write off products related to specific coins rather than expend resources creating detailed compliance programs, according to Ehrenhofer.    Why cryptocurrency exchanges delist privacy coins    The core reasons behind these delistings are the privacy features that are important to many cryptocurrency users. Bitcoin’s cypherpunk origins were in part about escaping the ties of the financial system and the surveillance and scrutiny it enables.      But regulators have seen those features as conflicting with AML and KYC regulations.      “Many countries’ official reasoning is that these bans and delistings would help combat money laundering and illicit use of cryptocurrencies. However, this seems more like a facade,” said Yap.      Japan’s delisting of privacy coins was triggered by the Coincheck hack of nem, which does not have any privacy features, according to Yap. The hack was a result of weak exchange security, not privacy coins, and privacy coins weren’t used to launder the proceeds.      “As in many cases, it seems that privacy coins were once again the scapegoat,” said Yap.      Read more: ShapeShift Delists Privacy Coin Zcash Over Regulatory Concerns      Australian exchanges like Swyftx apparently didn’t agree with the ban, but the reasoning behind it hasn’t been widely disseminated.      Korean exchanges cited Financial Action Task Force regulations as the reason to delist privacy coins despite privacy coins posing no issues with the FATF.      Bolstering Yap’s arguments is the fact that U.S. law firm Perkins Coie released a report on how privacy coins can be compliant with existing AML regulations.      “Is it possible for regulated entities to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) obligations when supporting privacy coins? The answer, in our view, is yes,” wrote the authors.      Ehrenhofer said the most common given reason for delistings is de-risking from perceived (or direct) pressure from regulators and banks.      “Most jurisdictions do not impose strict bans on these privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies, but they may require more detailed AML programs before feeling comfortable with them,” he said.    The impact on privacy coins    The delistings raise issues for privacy coins and signal to other actors in the ecosystem that it’s okay to delist them, even if there are no compliance issues. This has far-reaching effects.      Exchanges and other actors have delisted and could continue to do so under soft pressure not just from authorities but also their banking partners, even if they’re not breaking any laws.      Yap points to zcash’s delisting from Coinbase UK due to concerns from its banking partner, ClearBank, as one example of this, setting a problematic precedent if other banks follow suit.      Additionally, said Ehrenhofer, delisting of small assets deeply impacts the viability of those assets, lowering their liquidity to a critical level. On the other hand, for established privacy coins like monero it just pushes users “to exchange in riskier, less-compliant jurisdictions.”      As a result, “the information that would normally be within the view of regulators and compliant exchanges is now distributed among less-regulated exchanges in other jurisdictions, harming investigations,” he said.      And then there’s the inclusion of dash among those delisted coins. Originally conceived as “Darkcoin,” a fork of Bitcoin, Dash abandoned its focus on privacy years ago to concentrate on other use cases for its dash cryptocurrency.      In a statement shared with CoinDesk, Glenn Austin, Dash Core Group CFO, speculated that dash’s delisting may have been the result of a misperception, based on old assumptions derived from its Darkcoin roots. “Multiple leading industry experts conclude that dash is no more a privacy coin than bitcoin,” he said.      Indeed, as the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains develop more privacy features, exchanges will have to grapple with the necessary compliance processes they may have sought to avoid by delisting privacy coins.      Read more: Bitcoin’s Future: Exactly How a Coming Upgrade Could Improve Privacy and Scaling      But in the interim, said Yap, we may continue to see some coins remove their privacy features as they seek the basic goal of survival.    Looking ahead    “For some projects, the best approach may be to produce quality opinions and presentations that demonstrate how privacy coins can be supported while addressing AML/KYC concerns instead of fighting regulations,” said Yap.      He said another approach should be fighting the narrative of blockchain analytics firms, which promote the idea that on-chain analysis is the only way to grapple with AML/KYC concerns.      For Ehrenhofer, privacy-preserving cryptocurrency communities should work with compliance professionals to ensure they feel comfortable with the compliance programs they present to banks and regulators.      If a cryptocurrency exchange's survival doesn’t depend on it, it’s unlikely it will put in the compliance effort needed to support any coin that comes close to being in conflict with AML and KY considerations.      He points to ComplyFirst as a company that has created resources to assist exchanges in explaining how they can support assets that may result in more complex compliance cases.      “Privacy coins will continue to face opposition and challenges along the way, which will heat up as cryptocurrencies start becoming more mainstream,” said Yap. “However, just as VPNs, Tor, HTTPS, and end-to-end encrypted messaging are now considered standard protection tools, privacy technology in cryptocurrencies will be considered commonplace, too.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | XMR | ZEC,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/12/11/privacy-coin-advocates-persevere-amid-multiple-crypto-exchange-delistings,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8010df0ee2543d7c82f4c708ceb2b5a5857859f6-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405546,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeNPQb,1607708302,Women in Tech Say Proposed STABLE Act Harms Those It Claims to Protect,"Although the STABLE Act, proposed Dec. 2 by U.S. Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), Jesús “Chuy” García (D-Ill.) and Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.), is being portrayed by its supporters as protecting low-income communities, many women from marginalized communities fear it would actually make their situation much worse.      Several Black women in the tech industry, including Maker Foundation board member Tonya Evans, tweeted a plea to reconsider this bill. Olayinka Odeniran, chairwoman of the Black Women Blockchain Council, told CoinDesk her group of seven board members joined dozens of other professionals in signing a letter to the incoming Biden presidential administration asking for minority industry leaders to help draft such blockchain regulations.      “I come from the financial industry, so I know when any policy is in the early stages of being created they ask for the community’s input. The potential policy they are creating doesn’t have community input,” Odeniran said in an interview. “This will limit the amount of stablecoins out there that people from my community can use to on-board into the space. And it will limit the companies that are interested in using them to serve underprivileged or underbanked minorities.”      Stepping back, the STABLE Act would require stablecoin issuers to secure bank charters and regulatory approval before circulating stablecoins, the tokenized cash either backed by or representing the value of one dollar. In short, projects like the Maker Foundation would need to get an American banking license in order to shepherd ecosystem development of the Ethereum-based MakerDAO, a protocol built to issue a stablecoin called dai.      Dai is particularly popular among Latin American communities for remittances and among students or junior developers who aren’t wealthy enough to be considered accredited investors.      Read more: US Lawmakers Introduce Bill That Would Require Stablecoin Issuers to Obtain Bank Charters      People making more than $200,000 annually, under the STABLE Act, would still generally retain access to a broader spectrum of crypto assets. Licensed entities that prioritize such customers could still issue stablecoins. Coinbase, for example, issued the stablecoin USDC by way of the Centre consortium with Circle Financial – a team that could probably afford to apply for a banking license.    The claim that this is something to be proud of because it somehow protects minorities and low-income people from being bullied is nothing short of bullshit.    Odeniran said that, despite legislation like the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, historically banking institutions offer different rates or requirements from people of color. As such, raising the compliance cost of participating in blockchain networks would inevitably mean, she argued, that fewer institutions will serve populations with slimmer profit margins.      Silicon Valley unicorns are already taking the approach of “empowering” Venezuelan families by using cryptocurrency. This hasn’t appeared to ruffle regulatory feathers in California. The STABLE Act may soon undermine the choice Americans have to empower themselves with cryptocurrency, rather than simply exporting this tool for “freedom” to the developing world.    Repercussions    Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit Coin Center issued a statement warning the STABLE Act is so broad it could also make crypto node operators in the United States vulnerable to arrest.      That’s why pseudonymous Cosmos developer Chjango Unchained told CoinDesk in a direct message this bill could outlaw the use cases that help unbanked or underserved fintech users. As a woman of color from a low-income, immigrant household, now a junior professional in Silicon Valley, she tinkers with nodes and uses stablecoins to trade with the same type of systems that wealthier tech investors also use.      “I think the [bill’s] verbiage is paying lip service to those communities, but in reality the second-order consequences of it will play out to disenfranchise exactly those communities they seek to ‘protect,’” Chjango said in a text interview. “Stablecoins now enable users to never have to exit back into fiat, where all of those old guardrails protecting the incumbents are firmly in place. And the kinds of users who benefit from having access to such liquidity are exactly people of color.”      This is especially true if prospective wallet regulations simultaneously hinder those who hold their own crypto, rather than entrusting it to an exchange. On Wednesday, U.S. Reps. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), Ted Budd (R-N.C.) and Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sent a letter “expressing our concern” about rumors that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin intends to unveil self-hosted wallet regulations in the coming weeks.    Undermining bitcoin    Given this context, the STABLE Act strikes at bitcoin’s underlying thesis, where network contributors aren’t inherently financial service providers.      If American lawmakers disagree and enact legislation that could apply to node operators or wallet users, then a wide range of cryptocurrency users suddenly become legal targets.      Crypto ""is a means to financial freedom for so many who would otherwise have to submit themselves to a lifetime of indentured servitude to their student loans, all without requiring a credit check,” Chjango said.      It remains to be seen how this bill would impact the variety of crypto users beyond blockchain network operators – from hobbyist node operators to international activists. The bill’s advisory scholar, Willamette University law professor Rohan Grey, tweeted: “You have to accept that running an open blockchain network means you are, at some level, liable for the actions that take place on that network.”    Limiting access    Palestinian-American entrepreneur Mona El Isa, the Goldman Sachs trader turned CEO of Melonport AG, told CoinDesk in a direct message she is worried this bill could “raise barriers'' for “low- and moderate-income” households that “will now be shunned from the same system that currently doesn’t bank them anyway.”      Plus, El Isa said Palestinian tech enternpreuers and freelancers with limited banking services sometimes accept cryptocurrency payments from clients abroad because it’s one of the only ways for them to “earn an honest living.”      “The claim that this [STABLE Act] is something to be proud of because it somehow protects minorities and low-income people from being bullied is nothing short of bulls**t,” El Isa said.      Likewise, an American stablecoin user named Inna Dominus described Grey’s tweets about blockchain technology as “toxic.” As an executive in the legal industry who uses stablecoins as an educational tool with her family, Dominus told her daughter this bill is a prime example of why women of color need to keep fighting against prospective laws that would further marginalize minorities with fewer financial options.      Dominus said she believes the way ambiguous bills are carried out by government agencies may systematically put marginalized groups at an even further disadvantage.      “It seems silly that we’re still fighting the perception that crypto is more predatory than, say, large institutional banks,” she said in a text interview. “The difference between crypto and the banks is that banks have much better lobbying. … We need better representation on Capitol Hill or we will continue to see these promulgations, these kinds of misinformed bills.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/12/11/women-in-tech-say-proposed-stable-act-harms-those-it-claims-to-protect,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a3a4031f6523bcbbd92daaefe00ae738d29121b5-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405558,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeNPdO,1607706878,Money Reimagined: Bitcoin's Tug of War as Wall Street Moves In,"A tug of war over Bitcoin’s future is becoming more ferocious.      This battle, pitting corporate interests seeking to profit from the Bitcoin system’s disruptive potential against an anti-corporatist dream for a human-first financial system that bypasses institutional middlemen, has been in play for some time. But with bitcoin’s latest price rally, the fight has intensified.      Now, Wall Street’s heavyweights are moving in. And to many who hail from Bitcoin’s “cypherpunk” roots, those guys are the enemy.      The engagement of Fidelity, Citibank, BlackRock and now MassMutual need not be the death knell for a humanist Bitcoin dream. There’s still a pathway to a fairer, more open, inclusive financial model, even with those institutions increasingly investing in and engaging with bitcoin services. But the route to that idealized future is less direct and, inevitably, involves more intense competition.      It’s also not clear whether these competing visions can coexist in the long run. Either way, in the medium term – which may last decades – the tensions will persist and intensify. Who ultimately wins, and how, is what matters.    Know your crypto    To be clear, many long-term enthusiasts for bitcoin are cheering the arrival of these big names.      Partly that’s because their participation has boosted the cryptocurrency’s price, which keeps bitcoin HODLers happy. It’s also because these newcomers are finally comprehending the core value proposition for investing in bitcoin as a digitally scarce store of value. That offers vindication for all who’ve been telling this story for the better part of a decade.      But there’s still an inherent conflict between the interests of regulated, compliance-conscious institutions, which will support the imposition of regulations and controls to ease their own participation in it, and those that see such rules and constraints as exclusionary barriers to entry for a wider swath of humanity.      A lightning rod here is KYC and AML, the “know-your-customer” and “anti-money laundering” rules that compel banks to collect identifying records for all their account holders.      This system means everywhere that Bitcoin touches the legacy financial system, which it will increasingly do as more big name companies and financial institutions are drawn to it, there is growing pressure for crypto service providers to impose KYC and, in turn to avoid dealing with others who don’t. (See: the crypto “Travel Rule.”).      The problem is not only that KYC runs counter to the cypherpunk ethos of privacy. As we discussed in a recent Money Reimagined podcast, this requirement can seriously hurt the goals of financial inclusion and innovation.    State-backed stateless money    Raoul Pal, CEO of RealVision and influential global macro investor, found himself in the middle of this fight recently after he tweeted to bitcoiners that KYC is in their interest because it will bring institutional money into the asset and boost its value. As someone with an account bearing the name SexyWebCamPro100x noted in one of more than 700 replies to that remark, the tweet begged for a meme of someone kicking a hornet’s nest.      Pal is an influential thinker about Bitcoin’s place in the future financial system. So we invited him onto this week’s ""Money Reimagined"" podcast to discuss his brawl with Crypto Twitter. For balance, we also invited CoinDesk columnist Jill Carlson, who, among other roles, is a founder of the Open Money Initiative, which focuses on boosting financial access and economic freedom for underserved communities.      Pal offered a nuanced explanation of his position. He said while his point was partly about allowing both bitcoin HODLers and institutions to “get rich,” it was also that for the Bitcoin system to be a transformative force it needs the “network effect” of more money coming into the space, which in turn requires institution-friendly regulation.      “For people to realize their ambitions that it’s a stateless money … for it to be adopted by people who live within the confines of a sovereign state, unfortunately it will have to be regulated and there’s almost nothing we can do about it,” Pal said.      Some might see a contradiction: for Bitcoin to realize its power as a “stateless” network, the state must exercise more control over it. But Pal’s point is about sequencing. He says we need to first go through a process of official accommodation within the existing system to advance Bitcoin’s journey along “Metcalfe’s Law.” Once it becomes a ubiquitous network, then it is in a position to properly challenge that system.      Indeed, as Carlson pointed out, the positive thing, for those who believe in Bitcoin’s disruptive potential, is that “you’re not going to implement KYC and AML at the protocol level.” Since “there is nothing inherent to Bitcoin that can be regulated, enforced or controlled in that way,“ it can at that level always resist official coercion.      But she also worried that the ever-growing encroachment of compliance requirements on applications built on top of that protocol impedes access to it among marginalized and financially excluded people.      Carlson cited how LocalBitcoins, a peer-to-peer exchange network that was once a “gateway to economic freedom” in places that impose capital controls and other forms of monetary repression, has “increasingly come under scrutiny and has to institute more and more KYC and AML standards and protocols."" She added, “That’s problematic where we are talking about people who don’t have any identity or are unbanked and are refugees and so forth.”    Keep fighting    So, where does this go?      Following Pal’s trajectory, we must first see expanded ownership of bitcoin as an asset, during which its price will drive dramatically higher before eventually reaching stability. Only then can it accommodate a broader set of use cases.      One idea is that universal acceptance will then provide network effect benefits to “layer 2” solutions such as Lightning, which could enable lightweight, low-cost transactions for all.      Another is that universal bitcoin acceptance as a store-of-value lets it evolve into a programmable social reserve asset, which then becomes a form of smart, automatically executable collateral upon which innovative new forms of borrowing, lending and insurance are built. In theory, it could replace fiat sovereign assets such as U.S. Treasury notes and bonds as the building block for a global financial system, one that would presumably be more decentralized, with less friction and cost, more innovation and greater accessibility.      But does that mean those seeking positive, humanistic change must just wait their turn? Must they first let Wall Street have its fill? And what guarantee is there that just because it becomes an institutionalized asset it also becomes a tool for payments and financial access?      It’s hard to say. As Pal noted in our podcast interview, “The reality is that what we want [Bitcoin] to be, as individuals, is irrelevant. It’s a network that lives and breathes and does its thing.”      All that’s true. But individuals also have the capacity to organize and, for better or worse, the capacity to lobby governments to introduce rules that influence the evolution of these networked systems.      Which is why this tug of war must continue.    Global town hall    LET’S BE FRANC. The Swiss National Bank’s straightlaced central bankers run a predictable, transparent and generally respected monetary policy. So they might chafe at a comparison to China’s policymakers, who oversee a rather opaque, government-mandated system of capital controls and centralized interest rates. But according to this Bloomberg article, it looks as if Switzerland could earn the same “currency manipulator” label that the U.S. Treasury Department put on China in a politically charged move last year. In theory, the U.S. could consider sanctions if a country is deemed to be using its currency for unfair trade advantages. Switzerland has been actively intervening to hold down the value of the Swiss franc since 2011, when the euro crisis prompted huge inflows of safe haven-seeking money into the country’s economy.      The U.S. would be more within its rights to call Switzerland a currency manipulator than it was with China. (The Treasury Dept. removed the designation from China earlier this year.) Switzerland is explicitly using its money-printing powers to alter the value of its currency with the goal of making its businesses more competitive. China used to do the same thing a decade ago. But at the time of the Treasury designation it was going the other way: intervening to strengthen the yuan against the dollar. Still, you can hardly blame Switzerland from trying to inculcate its relatively small economy from forces outside of its control in the much larger currency zone across its borders.      The U.S. may well be sympathetic to that argument, and would refrain from applying sanctions. But, as the article points out, the risk to the Swiss National Bank is that currency speculators would see the designation as an excuse to test the central bank’s resolve. Might this lead to an even bigger influx of traders looking to push the Swiss franc higher on the bet that a now politically anxious SNB will hesitate to buy euros or dollars to stop the franc from appreciating? Maybe. But there’s a bigger picture problem here, one that plays into our future of money thesis.      The SNB’s problems in managing a currency speaks to a wider set of risks where investors are growing nervous about expansionary monetary policy and growing fiscal debts within the worst global economic environment since the Great Depression. Switzerland’s experience offers lessons, where letter-of-the-law U.S. policymaking could provoke unforeseen consequences in currency markets. Were this to play out on a more global scale, with bigger and more numerous economies involved, we could have ourselves an international currency war. And in that environment, the only safe place to go is into an apolitical, independent store of value. Historically, that role has belonged to gold. Now, many are arguing, it’s bitcoin’s turn.      AIRBNBUBBLE. Speaking of lessons, what can we learn from the remarkable turnaround at Airbnb? The home rental business looked doomed as travel ground to a halt in March when the reality of the COVID-19 pandemic set in. Yet, here it is, nine months later, launching an initial public offering that initially valued the company at $47 billion but saw it rise to $100 billion by the end of its first day of trading on Thursday. During a live CNN interviewthat was timed for the opening of the stock market, CEO Brian Chesky heard for the first time that the shares’ opening price was $139, almost twice the deal’s $68 level. He looked stunned. “I don’t know what to say,” he said.      Good answer. Because it doesn’t make a lot of rational sense in terms of valuation. (Airbnb’s net loss for the first nine months of the year was $697 million.) To me, this tells us two things: 1) “QE infinity” by the Federal Reserve has created so much liquidity in the hands of hedge funds and other institutions that they’ll chase whatever yield they can, and 2) they’ll deploy that cash whenever they find the right narrative.      It’s kind of a moot point whether Airbnb is truly worth the $100.7 billion market capitalization at which it closed the day. (As The Wall Street Journal noted, that’s a figure “greater than the combined market value of Marriott International Inc., Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. and Hyatt Hotels Corp.”) What matters is that cash-flush investors found what they were looking for: a good story.      Chesky took some smart moves to, first, mitigate the pandemic’s threat to its business and then, second, discover new opportunities to provide services to people looking to escape crowded, locked-down cities. But what matters is how that story of recovery from a bad situation, a story laid out in this WSJ video, plays out as an idea more than whether it equates to real projected value over time.      As we’ve noted, elsewhere, stories matter. They especially matter when there’s lots of unspent money looking for a good one.

CoinDesk’s Benjamin Powers goes digging, with experts, lawyers and, repeatedly, with FinCEN itself to find out how the powerful financial crimes enforcement network manages storage of the reams of “suspicious activity reports” it receives from banks. No one was able to give a straight answer. FinCEN, as Ben puts it, has become a honeypot of super-sensitive data.      SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce on a Bitcoin ETF, Custody Rules and What’s Next for the SEC. The “Crypto Mom” of the SEC confirmed she’s a straight-talking, pro-crypto maverick. When Nathaniel Whittemore asked, “When bitcoin ETF?” during his “Breakdown” podcast, Peirce replied: “The standard that we set out to approve a bitcoin exchange-traded product is one that’s not consistent with what we’ve done in the past [and] is not consistent with our statutory guidelines for what we are supposed to do. You’ve got to look at these on their facts and circumstances, but I don’t understand why we don’t already have one.”      Ethereum Far Outpaces Bitcoin in Developer Activity in 2020: Electric Capital Report. Developer activity is a vital metric for assessing the value of a network. So it’s really significant that by far the highest engagement among blockchains is found with Ethereum. Per an article on Electric Capital’s annual developer report by Brady Dale, Ethereum’s active developer count stood at 2,300 in the third quarter, compared with second-place Bitcoin’s number of 400. Now, the comparison is a bit apples to oranges because Ethereum is a multi-use case platform whereas Bitcoin is mostly a one-trick pony product, a currency. But there can be no doubt that for all its scaling challenges, Ethereum commands a great deal of enthusiasm among software developers. That, in itself, is cause for confidence.

42405561,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeNPeN,1607706070,"Blockchain Bites: Bitcoin Whales Throwing Their Weight Around, Virgil Griffith's Rights","There are more bitcoin ""whales"" than ever, and new data shows how they drive market movements. MassMutual is the latest legacy institution to buy into bitcoin. And the number of Ethereum developers is growing at a breathless pace.    Top shelf    Whales and krill New data from OKEx and Kaiko suggests that bitcoin “whales” – the mega-wealthy crypto investors and, potentially, institutions – were selling at market highs as retail investors bought in. Trading data of the bitcoin/tether pair on OKEx’s platform between August and November showed that during the November bitcoin rally whales took profits and bought the dip, while smaller buyers continued purchasing as they did in September and October, despite higher prices in the oldest cryptocurrency, and panic sold around the Thanksgiving pullback. While the picture is likely more complicated, OKEx's data shows how small buyers are faced with “swimming with the tide or against it,"" by holding positions largely influenced by major buyers and sellers.      Mass buy Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance, a $235 billion insurance giant, purchased $100 million worth of bitcoin and invested $5 million in the crypto asset manager NYDIG. MassMutual told the Wall Street Journal it was a seeking “measured yet meaningful” stake in an increasingly digital world by taking on direct exposure to bitcoin. The life insurance company is the latest institutional stalwart to join bitcoin’s march into the financial mainstream, joining other publicly traded corporations and multi-billion dollar money managers in embracing bitcoin’s “macro” play.      Developer doozy More than 300 new developers per month are coming into crypto to work on Ethereum, according to data compiled by venture firm Electric Capital. In its annual developer report, the VC found the number of coders entering the crypto space to develop blockchains and projects is increasing nearly across the board – though Ethereum is by far seeing the most action. Almost 2,300 average monthly developers worked on Ethereum across the third quarter of 2020, with Bitcoin in second at a bit under 400 (up 70% from three years ago).      Gone public An Ethereum-based investment fund, from the Canadian money manager 3iQ, has gone public on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). Some $76.5 million was raised in an initial public offering, which sold off two types of shares that offer exposure to ether, Ethereum’s native currency. In going public, the firm’s ether product marks a “world first,” according to a tweet by the fund manager on Thursday. 3iQ successfully launched a similar bitcoin fund earlier this year.

The latest giveaway on Dec. 12 reportedly sees 10,000 residents of the city apply for 200 digital yuan prizes. They can spend the CBDC at physical stores equipped with the appropriate point-of-sale technology, and now online via major Chinese companies. An earlier test occured in Shenzhen.

That said, smaller holders have also increased: This year, wallets holding at least five BTC have increased by 8,842 (4%) to 234,408.    At stake    First, rights. Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith stands accused of… what exactly?      Last year, Griffith, a 37-year-old American computer science doctorate, was arrested and detained for violating U.S. sanctions against North Korea, after he travelled to the nation to present on the decentralized, public blockchain Ethereum.      The Ethereum Foundation staffer and research scientist presented on how to utilize this open cryptocurrency network for local and international transfers, at the Pyongyang Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference. This information – essentially that ether is uncensorable – is decidedly in the public domain. He did not receive an honorarium for his presentation.      Now, Griffith’s attorneys are left wondering what the boy genius is accused of. In a new court filing the defense is requesting “particulars” about what services Griffith allegedly provided, who else was involved and how these services violated U.S. law. (He traveled to the nation even after his request for permission to do so from the State Department had been denied.)      “The defense should not be forced to use a decoder ring on over 6,800 pages of discovery – much of which has been heavily redacted by the government – to discern the basic information that should be present in every indictment: what crimes were actually alleged to have been committed, by whom, and where,” they write.      So what’s at stake? Only the civil liberties guaranteed and protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.      The count against Griffith is conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, as well as some associated legal violations. Though prosecutors were shy of specifics. (The IEEPA provides broad executive powers to place economic sanctions on individuals, businesses, governments and other entities – thereby prohibiting U.S. persons and corporations from dealing with sanctioned nations.)      Notably, under the 1988 Berman Amendment, the IEEPA prohibits sanctioning the transfer of information or “informational materials.” That includes the type of speech freely available online. The question now is whether Griffith provided a service to the North Korean government, a point his defense has rebuked.      Even if it’s granted that Griffith traveled to a sanctioned nation – a big taboo – and broke defense mandates limiting the type of “services” or information one can provide to an adversarial nation – it’s likely the information Griffith presented on would not be sanctionable.      Griffith’s presentation was titled “Blockchain and Peace,” and according to the complaint it addressed “how a blockchain technology, including a ‘smart contract,’ could be used to benefit” North Korea.      As the FBI itself has said, it contained “basic concepts accessible on the internet.”    Who won #CryptoTwitter?",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/11/blockchain-bites-bitcoin-whales-throwing-their-weight-around-virgil-griffiths-rights,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/db19e891a3107ae10082ef2541a1c40eb607a94a-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405549,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeNPRa,1607705755,Meet the 19-Year-Old Ukrainian Lawmaker With Millions in Monero,"Rostislav Solod, 19, is the youngest lawmaker in the city of Kramatorsk, Ukraine. He’s also a crypto millionaire.      Solod is the son of two national parliament members, Yuri Solod and Natalia Korolevska. He entered politics this autumn, fresh out of school. In his obligatory property declaration, he said he owned 185,000 monero, or $24.5 million worth of the cryptocurrency.      This was, in fact, the only piece of property the young lawmaker owned himself. Everything else in his declaration, including real estate, cars and trademarks, belongs to his parents.      Solod told CoinDesk during a recent interview that he started watching crypto when he was at school, around 2014. Bitcoin did not attract him. Monero (XMR), on the other hand, seemed like a more viable cryptocurrency due to its anonymity and constant demand by the dark market, Solod said.      He accumulated monero through 2015 on exchanges, he said, using his savings and some money his parents gave him for a business project that never happened. Solod “never really liked school,” he said, so he spent a lot of time studying financial markets and learning about crypto.      Ukraine, which was rated by Chainalysis as the country with the highest crypto adoption level in the world, is now in the process of passing its first legislation regulating crypto. Solod admits that, at first, he was not crazy about this.      “For me, as an entrepreneur and a young guy, this is bad: I used to see crypto as an island in the ocean, untouched by a sinful hand. An absolutely free zone where everyone can do anything. But as a politician, I understand that this law will bring money into the [country’s] budget,” Solod said.      Monero’s privacy feature no longer applies to Solod. He must report all his property as a public official, thanks to a law intended to prevent corruption and illegal enrichment in the country’s echelons of power. Going forward, the young politician might liquidate the crypto and reinvest the money into a new business project, he said.      Solod is thinking about getting into crypto mining (no decision on what coin so far) and buying some tokens from the freshly launched Efforce project supported by Apple co-founder Steve Wozlniak. But his favorite crypto-related plan is launching his own token, Solod said.      “Elections and the political career distracted me from these plans for a while,” he said.      They distract him from his studies as well. Solod said he’s currently pursuing an economy major at the Royal Holloway University in London. He’s studying remotely due to the coronavirus quarantine, he said, although it’s sometimes hard to find time for both work and school.      Asked why he decided to go into politics, Solod referred to his family, saying that “he was born in it.”      “I was interested to figure out why the country isn’t developing,” Solod said. “I really want to change the situation with the corruption. The old methods to prevent it aren’t working anymore.”",NEUTRAL,XMR,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | XMR,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/11/meet-the-19-year-old-ukrainian-lawmaker-with-millions-in-monero,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/19e7b367936193974368c965b121fd520e324aad-1242x1048.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405543,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeNPMf,1607702314,SDX Chief Gets Philosophical About Crypto's Swiss-Singapore Connection,"It’s been a busy couple of weeks for Switzerland’s digital asset exchange, SDX.      In chronological order (and pardoning the unavoidable alphabet soup): Last week SDX’s parent company, SIX, announced test results around the “feasibility” of wholesale central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), involving the Swiss National Bank (SNB) and Bank of International Settlements (BIS).      This week, SDX took a stake in crypto custody solution Custodigit with a view to building a “digital asset gateway” in Switzerland. Also this week, SDX said it is partnering with crypto-friendly Japanese bank SBI to build a digital asset exchange in Singapore by 2022.      This latter announcement was trumped to some degree by DBS Bank announcing its digital asset exchange, part-owned by Singapore’s stock exchange SGX, which will start trading next week.      Read more: DBS Bank’s Digital Exchange to Begin Trading Crypto ‘Next Week’      Asked if each respective exchange’s plans meant a sort of jurisdictional rivalry was ramping up over digital assets, Tim Grant, head of SDX, was philosophical.      “I would say the adversarial, shareholder primacy model that really goes back to the Friedman economics of the 1970s and 1980s has really gone in the 21st century,” Grant said in an interview. “We think about collaborating as a key way to keep the industry competitive as we grow the pie for digital assets.”    Switzapore    Rivalry might not be the right word. Some might say we are seeing the strengthening of a crypto daisy chain connecting Switzerland and Singapore.      It tends to be the usual suspects joining hands when it comes to banking, custody and trading of crypto. Swiss-regulated crypto banks like Sygnum, which is part of Custodigit, also have a strong foothold in Singapore. Similarly, FINMA-licensed SEBA Bank has already been onboarded as a market maker for the new DBS Digital Exchange.      (It’s interesting to note that Custodigit, which SDX is backing alongside Swisscom and Sygnum, was originally partnered with Deutsche Börse in Switzerland; the German exchange quietly departed the group about a year ago to pursue digital interests in its home jurisdiction.)      “Singapore and Switzerland have very similar characteristics,” said SDX’s Grant. “They each have very progressive central banks and regulatory regimes, and a progressive kind of political regime where they really support digital assets,” adding:    “I can imagine you’ll see us in other jurisdictions as we move forward. But Singapore was the obvious next step for us. We have a dialogue with DBS and all the big banks there and also the Monetary Authority of Singapore.”    Stepping back, the trepidation of a few years ago has been replaced with a strong demand for crypto from small to medium-sized banks and wealth managers, particularly in places like Switzerland and Singapore, Grant said. The Custodigit gateway is a response to this, he added, and also a way to bring in SDX’s investment in Omniex, which allows asset managers to access crypto exchanges.      The big picture is a steady institutional creep, said Grant, gathering pace in jurisdictions that have embraced the technology and also implemented the right sort of regulatory regimes.      “For me, the distinction between public and private, crypto and non-crypto is fast going away,” he said. “We are really starting to see this convergence happen now.”    CBDC impact    Something else Switzerland and Singapore have in common is an avid exploration of CBDCs.      SIX’s recent CBDC proof-of-concept, dubbed Project Helvetia, showed that work still needs to be done. The project explored the technological and legal feasibility of issuing a wholesale CBDC on a distributed ledger (R3’s Corda) and linking the digital asset platform to the existing wholesale payment system.      Read more: Swiss Wholesale CBDC Trial Shows ‘Feasibility’ for Central Bank Money on Distributed Ledger, BIS Says      Wholesale central bank money refers to the way banks and financial institutions pay for large securities trades and the like, as opposed to retail CBDC, which could one day be issued to individuals in place of physical cash.      Despite COVID-19 accelerating the case for retail CBDC, Grant said wholesale CBDCs are “more tractable,” adding that retail digital currencies are fraught with societal challenges, not least around the privacy of users. “Arguably we’re going to be able to generate impact sooner in the wholesale markets. We can see the pathway to wholesale CBDC a little clearer.”      David Rutter, CEO of R3, said the SIX trial was an important step in the evolution of CBDCs extending into 2021.      “It will become clear that it isn’t a race, it’s about getting it right,” Rutter said in an email.      Looking ahead, the hope was for SDX’s go-live date to be in Q2 2021, but Grant said the target is currently for end of 2021, early 2022, conditional on a number of regulatory factors and requirements. In the meantime, the exchange will continue partnering up and engaging in multiple cross-border initiatives.      “I doubt central bank currency will be issued in 2021, but that doesn’t stop us moving forward with SIX commercial money for the payment leg of the transactions that we will be facilitating,” he said.      SIX has also been involved in the CBDC project initiated by Banque de France, looking at ways to connect the two countries. Since SIX now owns Spanish stock exchange, Bolsas y Mercados Españoles, it means “accruing a bigger picture” in Europe, Grant said.      “We are excited to be in a jurisdiction like Switzerland, where everything is reasonably integrated,” he said. “But we’re not going to be as impactful as we know we can be, if we don’t engage with the Eurozone, which is clearly right in our backyard.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/12/11/sdx-chief-gets-philosophical-about-cryptos-swiss-singapore-connection,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b414892aee0fb29f5bdd3356bc74da17cc2ec630-1500x1101.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Sweden’s financial markets minister, Per Bolund, said the Riksbank finance committee has launched a review into the prospects of moving the country to a digital currency, a study that will be completed in November 2022, according to the report.  “It’s crucial that the digitalized payments market functions safely, and that it’s available to everybody ... depending on how a digital currency is designed and which technologies are used, it can have large consequences for the entire financial system,” warned Bolund.  As reported by CoinDesk in October, Sweden’s central banker Stefan Ingves has been pushing to go all-in on sovereign digital currency and fully adopt the e-krona.  The Riksbank governor has called on the Swedish Parliament to do the same. Ingves has stressed the decision to issue an e-krona needs to be made at a political level.  Currently, Sweden’s central bank is running an e-krona pilot project with Accenture Plc using distributed ledger technology.  The Riksbank reports it has seen Sweden’s cash usage drop to its lowest level ever with the COVID-19 pandemic accelerating the shift away from traditional money.

""The momentum that characterized bitcoin throughout October and November seems to have cooled down,"" Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the cryptocurrency-focused financial firm Diginex, told clients Friday in a note. ""Prices retrace even in light of positive news.""      In traditional markets, European shares fell as Germany reported record virus cases and deaths, and U.S. stock futures pointed to a lower open amid fading optimism over stimulus talks in Washington. Gold weakened 0.1% to $1,834 an ounce.    Market moves    If everyone says bitcoin is a hedge against central bank money printing, does that make it a hedge against central bank money printing?      It looks that way. Or at least that's one interpretation of recent news developments and market signals.      Government-issued currencies like U.S. dollars are accepted as a form of payment because the government decrees they be so. Such tenders are often referred to as ""fiat"" currencies, from the Latin ""It shall be.""      Bitcoin was invented 11 years ago as a new form of electronic peer-to-peer payment built atop a blockchain network that no single government, company or person would control. But it's the limits on the cryptocurrency's supply, hard-coded into the underlying network programming, that have garnered so much attention recently from big investors: Only 21 million bitcoin can ever be created, a true stumper for monetary economists or analysts accustomed to the supply and demand calculations typically applied to commodity markets from gold to oil to cocoa to pork bellies.      As governments and affiliated central banks have created trillions of dollars of fresh money this year to combat the steep economic toll of the coronavirus, more big institutional investors are deciding that bitcoin will hold its value as fiat currencies become ever more abundant.      Take the latest announcement from MassMutual, a U.S. life insurance company with $567 billion of assets under management as of Dec. 31. As reported by CoinDesk's Danny Nelson, the insurance company said Thursday it would take a 5% equity stake in the cryptocurrency investment firm NYDIG while buying $100 million of bitcoin for a general investment account.      ""There is nothing surprising to me about MassMutual leading their industry yet again by both seeing and acting on the long-term value of the bitcoin monetary risk premium for their policyowners,"" NYDIG Executive Chairman Ross Stevens said in a press release posted on the insurance company's website.      Notice that term: ""monetary risk premium"" – the idea that bitcoin will protect investors against the risk that monetary authorities just keep printing more money. It's the linchpin of the entire announcement.      ""As we've seen throughout the last few weeks, the level of institutional involvement in this tiny market is growing at a very rapid pace, and it will only continue to grow from here,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency-analysis firm Quantum Economics, wrote Thursday in a newsletter.      One takeaway is that perception might be turning into reality. If enough smart, powerful people with deep pockets decide bitcoin is a hedge against the risk of monetary easing, then fiat: It shall be.      Thursday brought the news the European Central Bank, led by President Christine Lagarde, would expand a pandemic-related asset-purchasing program by €500 billion (US$607 billion) to €1.85 trillion. It's the European version of quantitative easing, where central banks pump money into markets to boost asset prices and stimulate economic growth. The ECB already has cut one of its key lending rates to negative levels, so the extra stimulus pushes monetary policy stance to an unprecedented level of looseness.      ""The overall policy stance is expected to remain very accommodative,"" Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist for the forecasting firm Pantheon, told clients Thursday in a note. ""This includes persistent QE, in some form or the other, and negative rates for as far as the eye can see.""      First Mover has discussed extensively just how dramatically bitcoin prices have surged this year, some 156%, as the U.S. Federal Reserve printed trillions of dollars of fresh money to stimulate the economy and help finance the Treasury Department's staggering and still-growing-fast debt load of $27.4 trillion.      There's also been a lot of discussion in foreign-exchange circles of a decline in the dollar's value versus the euro, or rather the European currency's 8.2% appreciation this year versus the dollar to $1.21.      Less often quoted is bitcoin's price denominated in euros, which has climbed an also-dramatic 136% to €15,099.      Such gains might play into the perception that bitcoin is an as-good hedge against debasement of euros as it is against other the dollar. Or perhaps other currencies as well, if big investors keep buying into the premise.      - Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin was losing ground Friday amid a risk-off mood in traditional markets.      The top cryptocurrency by market value is trading near $17,700 at press time, representing a more than a 3% drop on the day. Meanwhile, major European stock markets and the futures tied to the S&P 500 are flashing red on Brexit uncertainty and the seemingly never-ending U.S. fiscal stimulus negotiations.      The sour mood is giving a lift to the U.S. dollar in foreign-exchange markets, putting extra pressure on dollar-denominated bitcoin.      Short-term technical studies are beginning to roll over in favor of the bears. The widely-tracked 14-day relative strength index has dropped into the bearish territory below 50 for the first time since Oct. 6. Back then, bitcoin was trading near $10,500.      The RSI’s bearish turn comes following the cryptocurrency’s recent downside break of a narrowing price range. As such, support of the two-month rising trendline, currently at $17,000, stands exposed. Some investors have positioned for an extended pullback, as discussed earlier this week.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Wallets With Over 1,000 Bitcoin Have Hit Record Number, Chainalysis Says    What's hot    Crypto-friendly CFTC Chair Tarbert intends to step down from leadership position early next year (CoinDesk)      India's banks are once more serving crypto traders and exchanges (CoinDesk)      Bitcoin whales buy low, sell high; retail investors chase rallies, according to data (CoinDesk)      Ethereum blockchain ecosystem boasts almost 2,300 developers on average, far outpacing No. 2 Bitcoin's roughly 400, Electric Capital report shows (CoinDesk)      JPMorgan completes live blockchain repo trade ahead of new product launch (CoinDesk)      Bitcoin chart views soared along with price in November, TradingView says (CoinDesk)      Binance Smart Chain successfully integrates Chainlink decentralized oracle network (Binance)    Analogs  The latest on the economy and traditional finance    U.S. unemployment claims rise to highest level since September (WSJ)      No-deal Brexit more likely as dinner meeting between U.K., European Commission top officials leaves teams believing a compromise may not be possible before time runs out (Bloomberg)      Missouri Republican Senator Josh Hawley introduces bill to provide second round of $1,200 stimulus checks (CNBC)      Mortgage originations on pace for best year ever with 30-year interest rates below 3% (WSJ)      Stimulus talks drag as U.S. legislative leaders McConnell, Pelosi give no sign they're ready to engage (Bloomberg)      Pricing the S&P 500 in hourly pay shows fourfold rise in decade (Bloomberg)      Realty investment arm of the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock, has received an additional $53M capital commitments for its fifth Asia-focused fund (Nikkei Asia Review)    Tweet of the day",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole, Sebastian Sinclair",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/11/first-mover-stimulus-bet-wins-even-as-bitcoin-slips-below-18k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d569d61bf213527ea22c27b18dc0abebd09cddc-1300x929.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405552,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeNPXU,1607692980,"Virgil Griffith Still Doesn’t Know What Exact Crimes He Is Accused of, Attorneys Say","Attorneys for Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith filed documents over the past week arguing he and they still don’t know exactly what he is being accused of doing.      Griffith, who was accused last year of violating U.S. sanctions law by traveling to North Korea and teaching locals how to transfer funds using cryptocurrency, has yet to receive a list of actual crimes for which he is being indicted, according to a Dec. 8 document published to the federal court system.      “The defense should not be forced to use a decoder ring on over 6,800 pages of discovery – much of which has been heavily redacted by the government – to discern the basic information that should be present in every indictment: what crimes were actually alleged to have been committed, by whom and where,” the document read.      Attorneys not involved in the case told CoinDesk in January that while prosecutors claim Griffith violated the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, at the time they hadn’t revealed what specifically he was accused of saying or doing.      According to one of Tuesday’s filings, this information is still unavailable. The document said Griffith is requesting “particulars” about what services he allegedly provided, who else was involved and how these services violated U.S. law.      Griffith’s attorney, Brian Klein, asked a federal judge to compel prosecutors to reveal details and evidence during a hearing in January. At the time prosecutors said they would comply with federal production requirements.    Legal rights    Griffith’s team further argued Tuesday that first amendment rights protected the Ethereum Foundation coder against government action. Repeating their long-standing argument that Griffith received no payment for his North Korea speech and therefore rendered no “services,” they said Griffith was well within his constitutional rights.      “To argue that he did, the government has to twist basic words beyond their common meanings,” the filing said.      The U.S. State Department banned all U.S. citizens from traveling to North Korea without express permission in 2017.      The argument was made in support of a motion to dismiss filed last month      Moreover, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) had a much greater role in the investigation leading up to Griffith’s 2019 arrest than had been initially disclosed, a third filing said.      FBI agents were discussing the case with OFAC employees at least as early as October 2019, well before the previously disclosed timeline of November 2019, according to the filing.      “The exact nature of OFAC’s expressed concerns are identical to the issues at stake here: namely, whether Mr. Griffith’s presentation falls under the informational exemption under the Berman Amendment and the FTIA and whether the giving of an oral presentation constitutes a ‘service’ in the context of a conference,” the filing said.      Information in the public domain is generally exempt from IEEPA restrictions.      As such, the filing says, even if Griffith provided any information that falls under OFAC’s “services” bucket, it should still fall within that public domain exemption that is protected by the First Amendment.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | ETH | REGULATION,"Nikhilesh De, Danny Nelson",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/12/11/virgil-griffith-still-doesnt-know-what-exact-crimes-he-is-accused-of-attorneys-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/62e29ded4f01b3de213276d2165d74cf73967c70-2560x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405562,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeNPfM,1607688000,"Bitcoin Whales Buy Low, Sell High; Retail Investors Chase Rallies: Data","Newly released data from crypto exchange OKEx gives one possible explanation of how larger holders of bitcoin – or “whales” – were able to influence prices as bitcoin rallied to a new all-time high in November.      During that bitcoin run-up, institutions and whales were able to buy dips and oftentimes sell when prices went up. That left the majority of the retail investors scrambling to chase the rally, according to a newly released OKEx data report.      Trading data of the bitcoin/tether pair on OKEx’s platform between August and November showed that during the November bitcoin rally, whales' such as individual investors with sizable holdings and, potentially, institutions were taking profits by selling their bitcoin. During that same month, smaller-sized traders, such as retail investors, continued buying as they did in September and October, despite higher prices in the oldest cryptocurrency, according to the report compiled by OKEx and blockchain data firm Kaiko.      Notably, during the end of November, as bitcoin’s price was approaching its new all-time high, a look at day-by-day trading activity of different groups of users on OKEx indicate that whales and institutions bought the Thanksgiving price dip, while retail and other smaller traders panic-sold their bitcoin during that small market crash on Nov. 26.      According to the report, the data indicated that while large bitcoin holders are “in the business of buying low and selling high,” they are not necessarily interested in buying bitcoin into rallies the way retail investors have been.      “Ultimately, [whales] seek to drive the market, shake out retail traders in panic and capitalize on opportunities to buy relatively cheap coins,” according to a the news release from OKEx. “For retail traders, and everyone else in between, the choice seems to be between two options: swimming with the tide or against it.”    A different take    Yet, data from another crypto analysis firm, CryptoQuant, has a slightly different take. Its view is that throughout 2020 bitcoin whales have almost never missed a “buy the dip” opportunity.      One CryptoQuant conclusion is the large-sized traders may have prevented bitcoin’s price from crashing further and instead drove each price rally, potentially making profits by selling bitcoin at higher prices.    New institutions turning whales into small fish    There appears to be two types of institutions in the crypto space in 2020: those crypto natives including crypto quant firms and family offices, and those who are from the traditional financial markets such as MicroStrategy or MassMutual.      The latter group is unlikely to be the cause of each price dip by intentionally selling their bitcoin in order to cause a market crash, according to analysts who spoke with CoinDesk.      Major institutions ""have not disclosed selling positions that would indicate this,” John Todaro, told CoinDesk in an email response, citing MicroStrategy and Grayscale (CoinDesk’s sister company) as examples. Both companies have not been on the sell side of bitcoin.      Todaro added that although institutional money has been part of the reasons for this year’s rallies, it does not explain recent price gains because institutions often trade bitcoin through over-the-counter firms, which are designed to have minimal price impact on the market.      Over-the-counter (OTC) desks ""have increased two-way markets as more counterparties are on-boarded, allowing them to match buyers and sellers more directly to have less impact on markets,” Todaro said. “Smaller institutions or whales, though, may be less reliant on OTC desks and more likely to utilize exchanges, even placing large market orders that could have a larger immediate impact on price.”      And as more large institutions enter the bitcoin market, small institutions and whales are increasingly becoming smaller market players, Todaro said.      As well, traditional institutions are unlikely to deliberately impact the market because they are buying the narrative that bitcoin is digital gold, said Matthew Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise Asset Management. Therefore, it’s unlikely this new class of bitcoin investors would sell into market crashes.      “They don’t sell into dips because they don’t have anything to sell, and because they feel they need to establish a position in the market given the macro conditions and the significant upside potential still left in crypto,” Hougan said.

In a blog post Wednesday, the New Zealand branch of accountancy firm Grant Thornton said it has opened a claims portal allowing affected users to register for the repatriation of property still held by the exchange. All accounts were frozen after over US$17 million in ether and ERC-20 tokens was stolen during a hack in early 2019.      Grant Thornton said the ""sheer volume"" of emails means it is informing users about the portal in batches throughout the week.      Around 960,000 former Cryptopia users are being informed, and those registering are being asked to confirm some account details to ensure only verified users of the exchange make claims. As previously reported, Grant Thornton said the steps are necessary to ensure the repatriation of assets complies with New Zealand law.      In April 2020, a ruling by the High Court in Christchurch said customers were entitled to the assets they held in Cryptopia accounts, determining those assets are classed as ""property.""      In turn, that ruling paved the way for Grant Thornton to initiative the claims. ""This marks the launch of the Cryptopia claims portal to start the process of returning account holders' property,"" the liquidator's post reads.

In a letter filed with the New York Supreme Court on Wednesday, the NYAG said stablecoin issuer Tether and cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex had been cooperating with its inquiry.      The NYAG also noted the timeline for documents to be handed over would come after a deadline, previously mediated by the court, that once again ordered the crypto companies to hand over documents outlining their financial relationship.      As such, the NYAG seeks in the letter to extend an injunction, which bars Tether from loaning Bitfinex any further funds, to Jan. 15, 2021. The date has previously been extended on multiple occasions and is again expected to expire this week before the documents are provided.      The NYAG has alleged Bitfinex attempted to cover up the loss of $850 million in funds held on behalf of customers via payment processor Crypto Capital, and that it secretly borrowed the shortfall from sister firm Tether's reserves. Tether issues the USDT stablecoin, which now has a market capitalization of close to $20 billion, according to markets data site CoinGecko.      Counsel for the crypto companies previously argued the document production order was too broad. The NYAG's office argued otherwise claiming Bitfinex's attempts to delay the then 17-month-old order ""must stop.""
