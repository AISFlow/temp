Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: A late surge carried bitcoin past $31,000, where it started the week.  Insights: A Citi report calculates the potential value of the metaverse at $13 trillion, but platforms are struggling to attract committed users.  Technician's take: Price bounces have been short-lived, indicating a loss of buying strength.

Ether and other major digital assets also rose in the afternoon, regaining ground lost earlier in the week.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading above $31,200, about flat over the previous 24 hours but well up from its temporary perch below $29,300 in early Tuesday morning U.S. trading. Bitcoin had plummeted late Monday and has continued to trade in a choppy range amid widespread investor anxiety about inflation, geopolitical turmoil and the global economy.  Ether, the second-largest crypto, was recently down over 1%, trading just above the $1,800 level. Other major altcoins were mixed with SOL off more than 7% but LINK up over 8%. Sentiment remained bearish.  “The markets are continuing the long-term downtrend, but the recent crypto-friendly bill in the U.S. is giving short-term support as it proposes to gut the infamously over-reaching [Securities and Exchange Commission] in terms of their jurisdiction over crypto,"" James Key, CEO of Web 3 protocol Autonomy Network, told CoinDesk.  Equity markets, which have swung up and down in recent days as investors digested a few upbeat tidbits along with their recent diet of bad news, climbed on Tuesday with the tech-heavy Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average all up more than a half-percentage point.  Still, investors had plenty to worry them on Tuesday. The World Bank ratcheted back its 2022 forecast for global economic growth to 2.9% from the 4.1% it predicted in January. World Bank Group President David Malpass called ""the risk"" of stagflation ""considerable.” Later in the day, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told the Senate Finance Committee that she expected inflation to remain high. And less than three weeks after posting disappointing first-quarter results, Target warned investors that its profits would fall because of changing consumer behavior that has created imbalances in its inventory.  Many analysts expect the crypto bear market to worsen in the near future, and Key noted that bitcoin's previous down cycles had bottomed out after 85% drops in value over at least 18 month periods. The current market has lost close to 60% of its value since reaching an all-time high last November.  “I really doubt this is the bottom,"" Key said. ""In addition, those previous cycles were all in a long-term equities bull market, whereas that isn't true for the first time ever. When institutional investors are de-risking, 'exotic' and risky assets like crypto are the first to be sold, which indicates this time has the potential to be a worse bear market.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,160 +0.9%  DJIA: 33,180 0.8%  Nasdaq: 12,175%  Gold: $1,851 +0.6%  Insights  The Metaverse Struggles to Attract Committed Users  A recent report from Citi has calculated the total addressable market value of the metaverse at $13 trillion.  If realized, this would be an impressive achievement considering that the value of the gaming market is only $180 billion, according to gaming research house NewZoo, and the market for PC gaming hardware is only $5.7 billion.  For the most part, the Metaverse market is just a worse-performing version of the gaming market. Metaverse exchange-traded funds (ETF), with their exposure to publicly listed crypto companies, have lagged behind their gaming counterparts on the market – despite being mostly the same thing.  Citi argues the $13 trillion figure comes from all “internet-related revenue to that of the physical-world activities being displaced.” This makes some massive assumptions about the future of e-commerce because it implies that all parts of the e-commerce stack are going to be disrupted by the metaverse.  This seems to almost parallel the bullish mentality from augmented reality (AR) back in the late 2010s. If you would have listened to VCs and research companies, AR was ready to make unicorns by the dozens as mobile-driven augmented reality was ready to disrupt so many parts of the internet economy from gaming to advertising.  But the AR space failed to generate any useful unicorns. Blippar, a promising London-based startup that melded artificial intelligence (AI) and AR, went insolvent in late 2018 after raising $37 million at a billion-dollar valuation.  The app promised to revolutionize e-commerce by allowing users to point their phone at any object and get all the info the app could gather from visual recognition and online searches. It could also be used to provide augmented, 3D visualizations of products enhancing the online sales opportunities for retailers. This was all very interesting and promising for new revenue models, but the user base never materialized.  Aside from Blippar, Magic Leap, which came out with promising initial visuals that it never managed to deliver upon, sucked the life out from capital markets for AR, depriving many promising AR startups of their means to create this promised augmented reality. Despite the success of Pokemon Go, there just wasn’t another AR unicorn like it.  Going back to Citi’s metaverse predictions, much like the bull market around AR in the late 2010s, something is missing: users. On-chain data shows that despite lofty valuations, the metaverse majors struggle to build a user base with some only having a few thousand at most compared to the tens of millions of gamers playing simultaneously on Steam or Xbox Live.  And it’s not because these are new platforms: PC gaming network Steam hit its first 1.5 million concurrent users six years after launch; Decentraland currently has less than 1,200 active users and has been open to the public for two-and-a-half years.  We have a long way to go before the metaverse is a $13 trillion opportunity.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Choppy Around $30K, Support at $25K-$27K  Bitcoin (BTC) remains in a choppy trading range as short-term indicators are neutral. The cryptocurrency could find support at $25,000 and $27,000 as its price continues to stabilize from last month's sell-off.  BTC was down by as much as 4% over the past 24 hours.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart returned to below the 50 neutral mark, indicating weak momentum behind the latest price bounces above $30,000. On the weekly chart, the RSI is the most oversold since March 2020, which preceded a rise in crypto prices.  Still, indicators can remain oversold for several weeks, especially within a price downtrend. That means upside could be limited for BTC, with immediate resistance at the 50-day moving average of $33,371.

Here is a closer look at the potential reversal signal and the conditions necessary for confirmation of bullish upside. A &apos;Morning Star&apos; Could Jump Start A Bullish Reversal Bitcoin has been in a brutal downtrend since November 2021. After a full month of extreme fear in the crypto market and some of the most frightening macro conditions ever, few are ready to buy until clearer signs of a reversal. An early sign could be here, representing the early rise of each new day. The signal is called a morning star reversal pattern, and is a three-candle bullish reversal pattern according to the study of Japanese candlesticks. The use of Japanese candlesticks was developed by 18th century Japanese rice trader, Munehisa Homma. It wasn&apos;t popularized in the West until Steve Nison published Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques in the early 90s. Since then, they have become an important weapon in a technical analyst&apos;s arsenal when used in combination with indicators, patterns, trend lines, and more.

42423144,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2Wz7h,1654643363,Crypto Bank Custodia Sues Federal Reserve,"Custodia filed suit against the U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday, saying the central bank was unlawfully delaying a decision on the crypto bank's application for a master account.  In the filing in the United States District Court of Wyoming, Custodia accused the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City of delaying the application process by 19 months and called the master account ""critical"" to Custodia's business.  ""Such an account would allow Custodia to directly access the Federal Reserve, rather than going through an intermediary bank,"" Custodia said in the complaint. It also accuses the Fed of adopting ""standardless"" procedures that allowed it ""to act in complete secrecy, whenever and however they choose.""  The suit said the Fed's own paperwork says that ""a master account decision ""ordinarily takes [five to seven] business days,"" and that the processing delay had ""clearly violated the [one]-year statutory deadline for doing so.""  In February, Wyoming-based Custodia, which was formerly called Avanti Bank, seemed to be moving closer to acquiring the master account when it received a routing number issued by the American Bankers Association (ABA) – a key milestone in the process to receive a Fed account.  Routing numbers are used to identify banks for checks and other transactional purposes, and are issued only to federal- or state-chartered financial institutions that are also eligible to have a Fed account, according to the ABA’s website.

The company which is valued at $1 billion had put a significant portion of its own funds into buying BTC but the majority of the money used to purchase all of the bitcoin had been from loans. These loans which include convertible notes, senior secured loans, and bitcoin-backed loans account for $2.4 billion of its $3.97 billion BTC purchases. How The Loans Look MicroStrategy had used convertible notes to fund a good portion of its bitcoin holdings. These notes are converted into stock of the company when they mature. So basically, they are a payment towards future stock ownership of the software company. The convertible notes make up $1.75 billion which are pegged at a 0% to 0.75% interest rate. Making up by far the largest part of the loans MicroStrategy has taken out to buy bitcoin. The other loans are much lesser compared to the convertible notes. An example is the senior secure loans. Data shows that MicroStrategy had only taken $500 million in these senior secured loans to purchase bitcoin. These, however, carry a higher interest rate at 6.1%.

But again, it failed to hold above $30,000. Following nine red weekly candles, BTC retested $31,700 in the first green week on June 06 and then plummeted sharply in the next 24 hours at $29,000. Fortunately, BTC&apos;s price is rising again and currently trading above $31,000. The fall of the fledging coin leads altcoins to face dumps, too, mainly affecting the prices of SOL, AVAX, and BNB.

42411781,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfzH8,1654635999,What Are Liquidity Pools?,"Liquidity is a fundamental part of both the crypto and financial markets. It is the manner in which assets are converted to cash quickly and efficiently, avoiding drastic price swings. If an asset is illiquid, it takes a long time before it is converted to cash. You could also face slippage, which is the difference in the price you wanted to sell an asset for vs. the price it actually sold for.  Liquidity pools play a large part in creating a liquid decentralized finance (DeFi) system.  Imagine waiting to order inside a fast-food restaurant. Liquidity is comparable to having lots of cashiers. That would speed up orders and transactions, making customers happy. On the other hand, illiquidity is comparable to having only one cashier with a long line of customers. That would lead to slower orders and slower transactions, creating unhappy customers.  In traditional finance, liquidity is provided by buyers and sellers of an asset. In contrast, DeFi relies on liquidity pools to function. A decentralized exchange (DEX) without liquidity is equivalent to a plant without water. It won’t survive. Liquidity pools provide a lifeline to DEXs.  What is a liquidity pool?  A liquidity pool is a digital pile of cryptocurrency locked in a smart contract. This results in creating liquidity for faster transactions.  A major component of a liquidity pool are automated market makers (AMMs). An AMM is a protocol that uses liquidity pools to allow digital assets to be traded in an automated way rather than through a traditional market of buyers and sellers.  In other words, users of an AMM platform supply liquidity pools with tokens, and the price of the tokens in the pool is determined by a mathematical formula of the AMM itself.  Liquidity pools are also essential for yield farming and blockchain-based online games.  Liquidity pools are designed to incentivize users of different crypto platforms, called liquidity providers (LPs). After a certain amount of time, LPs are rewarded with a fraction of fees and incentives, equivalent to the amount of liquidity they supplied, called liquidity provider tokens (LPTs). LP tokens can then be used in different ways on a DeFi network.  SushiSwap (SUSHI) and Uniswap are common DeFi exchanges that use liquidity pools on the Ethereum network containing ERC-20 tokens. At the same time, PancakeSwap uses BEP-20 tokens on the BNB Chain.  Read more: Decentralized Liquidity Is the Backbone of DeFi  What is the purpose of a liquidity pool?  In a trade, traders or investors can encounter a difference between the expected price and the executed price. That is common in both traditional and crypto markets. The liquidity pool aims to eliminate the issues of illiquid markets by giving incentives to its users and providing liquidity for a share of trading fees.  Trades with liquidity pool programs like Uniswap don't require matching the expected price and the executed price. AMMs, which are programmed to facilitate trades efficiently by eliminating the gap between the buyers and sellers of crypto tokens, make trades on DEX markets easy and reliable.  What are the incentives for liquidity pool providers/depositors?  There are multiple ways for a liquidity provider to earn rewards for providing liquidity with LP tokens, including yield farming.  Read More: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained  This allows a liquidity provider to collect high returns for a slightly higher risk by distributing their funds to trading pairs and incentivizing pools with the highest trading fee and LP token payouts across other platforms.  How does a liquidity pool work?  As mentioned above, a typical liquidity pool motivates and rewards its users for staking their digital assets in a pool. Rewards can come in the form of crypto rewards or a fraction of trading fees from exchanges where they pool their assets in.  Here is an example of how that works, with a trader investing $20,000 in a BTC-USDT liquidity pool using SushiSwap.  The steps would be as follows:  Go to SushiSwap.  Find the BTC-USDT liquidity pool.  Deposit a 50/50 split of BTC and USDT to the BTC-USDT liquidity pool. In this case, you would deposit $10,000 worth of USDT and $10,000 worth of BTC.  Receive BTC-USDT liquidity provider tokens.  Deposit LPTs to the BTC-USDT staking pool.  Get the SUSHI token as a reward after the lockup period that you agreed to hold within a vault. It can be a fixed time like one week or three months.  The BTC-USDT pair that was originally deposited would be earning a portion of the fees collected from exchanges on that liquidity pool. In addition, you would be earning SUSHI tokens in exchange for staking your LPTs.  Popular liquidity pool providers  Many decentralized platforms leverage automated market makers to use liquid pools for permitting digital assets to be traded in an automated and permissionless way. In fact, there are popular platforms that center their operations on liquidity pools.  Uniswap – This platform allows users to trade ETH for any other ERC-20 token without needing a centralized service. It is an open-source exchange that lets anyone start an exchange pair on the network for free.  Curve – A decentralized liquidity pool for stablecoins based on the Ethereum network. It provides reduced slippage because stablecoins aren't volatile.  Balancer – A decentralized platform providing a few pooling options such as private and shared liquidity pools offering catered benefits for its liquidity providers.  Pros and cons of liquidity pools  Pros  Simplifies DEX trading by performing transactions at real-time market prices.  Allows people to provide liquidity and receive rewards, interest or an annual percentage yield on their crypto.  Uses publicly viewable smart contracts to keep security audit information transparent.  Cons  The pool of funds is under the control of a small group, which is against the concept of decentralization.  Risk of hacking exploits because of poor security protocols, causing losses for liquidity providers.  Risk of frauds such as rug pulls and exit scams.  Exposure to impermanent loss. This happens when the price of your assets locked up in a liquidity pool changes and creates an unrealized loss, versus if you had simply held the assets in your wallet.

42423165,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2Wzfh,1654633791,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Close to $30K as Investors Search for a Bottom,"Bitcoin (BTC) dropped toward $29,200 before a sharp turnaround that saw the price get close to $30,000 later in the New York trading day. The cryptocurrency has traded in a choppy price range, and so far upside has been capped as some buyers remain on the sidelines.  Meanwhile, alternative cryptos (altcoins) were mixed on Tuesday. Chainlink's LINK token rallied by as much as 11% over the past 24 hours, compared with BTC's flat performance over the same period. Internet Computer's ICP token was down by 6% on Tuesday, and Solana's SOL token declined by 4%.  Sentiment among crypto traders remains bearish, although some analysts and fund managers are starting to search for a price trough in the hopes of recovering from big losses realized over the past month.  ""For each cycle we go through in digital assets, the time to accumulate is during the bear markets, and those gains are rewarded exponentially when the bull cycle resumes,"" Two Prime, a digital asset investment firm, wrote in an email. The firm expects its portfolio to recover from a slump if BTC returns above $33,000 and ether (ETH) returns above $2,200, roughly 10% and 20% above current price levels, respectively.  Two Prime's Digital Asset Fund, which also uses derivatives for income and hedging purposes, is expected to post a return of negative 31.4% for May, which largely followed the underperformance of ETH and other altcoins such as SOL. Typically, altcoins decline more than BTC during down markets because of their greater risk profile.

Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Identifying a cycle bottom  Most indicators suggest bitcoin is approaching the middle or end of a bear market. For example, the realized price model, which is an estimate of the average cost basis of all BTC in supply, is $23,600. Some analysts view that as a key support level, which could indicate a price low.  ""Historically, the overall market cost basis or realized price has been a very sound cycle support level, with 84.9% of bitcoin trading days closing above this level. In other words, only 15.1% of trading days have closed below the realized price,"" Glassnode, a crypto data firm, wrote in a blog post.  To confirm a low, BTC would need to return above the realized price level, similar to what occurred at the end of previous bear markets. That suggests market participants haven't fully capitulated yet.  ""The bitcoin bear market is not over yet, although it has made a significant part of its way down. The market is full of rumors that short-term buyers have already capitulated,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Rather, a bull market begins when medium-term investors and even some long-term investors capitulate, which could attract buyers at lower prices, according to Kuptsikevich. BTC is ""unlikely to reach this point before the price returns to the highs of 2017 (around $19,800),"" he wrote.

Verrilli’s career includes previously serving as a solicitor general for the U.S. from 2011-2016 under the Obama administration.

42411789,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfzha,1654632450,"Learn-to-Earn, Move-to-Earn: How to Earn Crypto in New Ways","Crypto projects are often preoccupied with different ways to promote themselves in a space full of loud and fast-moving players. One way involves handing out tokens to their users in return for learning, playing or even just walking around.  You may not need to buy or mine crypto to acquire some coins these days, but you do still have to give something in return – often it’s your time or attention. In some cases, you will still have to pay an initial lump sum to start earning income over time through your activities.  Whether these projects can prove sustainable in the long term is very much an open question.  Learn-to-earn  ""Learn-to-earn"" is the idea of rewarding you with tokens simply for learning about crypto, usually in the form of some of the tokens you just learned about.  There are two motivations at play here: the companies behind the platform and the people behind the cryptocurrency. The learn platform (currently most often an exchange) wants you to do it on their platform. This will make you more likely to engage with them as soon as you know what’s what. They are competing to drive traffic to their platform.  The tokens are competing for market share in an increasingly competitive space. By teaching you and getting you invested in their projects by making you also investors (even in very small amounts), they have the chance to grab attention from 18,000 other cryptos and educate you on the “why” and “how” of their project.  Where can you learn-to-earn?  A few well-known crypto entities offer this kind of incentive, including some of the big centralized exchanges.  With Coinbase Earn, you watch animated videos or read an article and then complete quizzes to test if you were paying attention. You get crypto rewards deposited into your account for completing the quizzes correctly and receive a bit of the specific crypto that you just learned about. The rewards aren’t going to make you rich, but it’s a relatively low time investment to learn and earn here.  To take part in Binance Learn, you have to have a Binance account already. So this partly serves as a perk or reward of having an account with Binance. Just like on Coinbase, you watch videos and take quizzes on what you learned. On Binance, however, you get a voucher for crypto tokens that you have to go and redeem yourself. But watch out: It’s only valid for 14 days.  Read More: Platform Pitches ‘Earn While You Learn’ For Business Execs  If you’re a newcomer to the world of crypto, and you’ve decided to stick to the sense of safety offered by a major centralized exchange, you might not care at first which one you use. Learn-to-earn features are one way they can differentiate themselves from the crowd.  Another centralized exchange, Phemex, has offered a learn-to-earn feature, but at the time of writing, it has announced on its website that the reward element has been suspended “due to the restructuring of our bonus program.” So it’s worth remembering that any rewards program can get cut when companies have to tighten their belts.  Move-to-earn  It might be a bit less obvious why crypto projects would reward you with tokens just for moving. Take a look at this example.  Stepn is one of the first ""move-to-earn"" projects. It rewards you for your physical, real-life step count. But you don’t just get to move and earn – you have to buy virtual sneakers in order to start earning. The sneakers are represented by a non-fungible token (NFT). At the time of writing, the cheapest Stepn sneakers on the Magic Eden marketplace were going for more than 13 solana tokens, a value of more than $650.  Read More: Stepn’s ‘Move-to-Earn’ Model Has Crypto Analysts Seeing Value  That’s your first clue as to how the project is making money while paying you to walk around. Stepn takes a royalty fee whenever its NFTs change hands. It also charges fees connected with various other things you can do in its app, including ""breeding"" two sneaker NFTs together to make a new one.  Once you have your ""sneakers,"" you can earn tokens for going out and physically exercising in real life. As of April 2022, the company said it had 200,000 daily users, and its app had been downloaded 1 million times. That’s a lot of people buying sneakers and royalty fees flowing to the creators. But at the same time, it could really be helping people to motivate themselves to exercise.  Read More: 'Move-to-Earn' Application Stepn Suffers Cyber Attack After Upgrade  Any other easy ways to earn crypto?  Move-to-earn comes broadly under the category of GameFi, meaning gaming crypto finance.  Another term you’ll come across is ""play-to-earn."" One of the most famous examples is Axie Infinity, which rewards users with its native token in return for various in-game achievements.  Gaming projects benefit from attracting a larger volume of users. The tokens they use for rewards have special uses within the game’s ecosystem and entice users to keep coming back. Some, like Axie Infinity, generate revenue by charging transaction fees within the ecosystem. The challenge for the creators is to design an in-game economy that will generate a profit.  Reports emerged in 2021 that impoverished users in countries such as Venezuela were using Axie Infinity to help them earn a living. But storm clouds have since gathered. Research showed that users in the Philippines, who were playing the game using borrowed NFTs and paying a yield to lenders, were still earning less than the country’s minimum wage for doing so. A hack in March 2022 led to the loss of tokens worth more than $625 million from a blockchain that serves the Axie ecosystem. And Axie's native token AXS dropped from around $94 on Jan. 1, 2022, to just over $20 at the time of writing.  The takeaway is that no project should ever be relied upon to keep paying you indefinitely and to look at these crypto earning projects with a critical eye, knowing that the rewards may not last forever.

This staked product promises high yields to users who stake their crypto. In addition, the company hopes this offer will outperform those of rival exchanges in the US. The staking service is an offering where customers lock crypto-assets to support PoS networks. However, the exchange platform also benefits from the process. According to Binance.US, users can earn over 18% APY on different tokens. The PoS blockchains that the company supports are Cosmos, Solana, Livepeer, BNB Chain, Avalanche, and Audius. However, the firm noted that it would add more tokens later on. According to the CEO of Binance.US, Brian Shroder, &apos;The aim is to outperform staking APYs offered by Gemini and Coinbase. We want it to stand out in terms of usability and competitive returns.&apos; Shroder says staking ATOM from Cosmos blockchain will give 12.2% APY.

The company, which already offered crypto services in New York through a partnership with stablecoin issuer Paxos, has had a conditional license in the state since October 2020, when it first announced it would allow its customers to buy or sell cryptocurrencies. The company has now successfully converted its conditional license to a full one.  The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), which oversees the licensing regime more popularly known as the BitLicense, has issued more than 20 licenses to date. The agency announced PayPal’s conversion Tuesday.  NYDFS Superintendent Adrienne Harris told CoinDesk that her agency is “committed to keeping New York at the center of responsible technological innovation and forward-looking regulation” in a statement.  “The conditional virtual currency license allows businesses to have well-regulated access to the New York marketplace through partnerships with licensed firms, ensuring that New Yorkers have access to a wide variety of virtual currency products with appropriate consumer protections,” she said. “With PayPal’s conversion to a BitLicense, the conditional license is now a proven framework for licensure.”  PayPal SVP of Regulatory and Customer Compliance Andrea Donkor told CoinDesk in an email that ""the future of safe and responsible innovation in crypto requires strong partnership between regulators and industry. The NYDFS’ leadership has been critical in enabling PayPal to continue to responsibly provide greater inclusion and access to our customers.""  Earlier on Tuesday, PayPal announced it would also let its customers withdraw their cryptocurrency holdings to private or other third-party wallets. Previously, the company employed a walled garden, only allowing customers to buy or sell directly to fiat.  PayPal Senior Vice President of Blockchain, Crypto and Digital Currencies Jose Fernandez da Ponte told CoinDesk the move was in response to user demand.  “We’ve also been very vocal from the beginning that we’re in this because we are a payments and commerce company, and we think that our role in the ecosystem is about increasing access,” he said.

Citadel Securities is the sister company to hedge fund giant Citadel.  The firms in Citadel Securities’ initial consortium will be joined by additional wealth managers, market makers and other industry leaders that are expected to join the marketplace ahead of launch, the source added.  “This marketplace is intended to create more efficient access to deep pools of liquidity for digital assets. So a group of industry leaders are working closely together to facilitate the safe, clean, compliant and secure trading of digital assets,” the source told CoinDesk.  The current crypto market structure is deficient and inhibits wider adoption from a lot of investors, which is what Citadel Securities’ trading consortium is addressing, the source said. “It’s more of a crypto trading ecosystem or marketplace than an exchange. It’s going to take on the exchanges by building a better mousetrap.”  A second person told CoinDesk that Citadel Securities had been “quietly hiring executives” to build out a crypto trading stack. A third source said the firm is in discussions about “a huge amount of systematic internalizing involving [Citadel’s] sister companies.”  Citadel Securities, of course, is helmed by crypto skeptic Ken Griffin, who scuttled ConstitutionDAO’s efforts to buy an original copy of America’s founding document. Though he had earlier said crypto was a “Jihadist call” against the U.S. dollar, his firm has since announced plans to make markets for various cryptocurrencies.  Virtu is known to be involved in market making for crypto futures products and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Canada. The firm was also said to be carrying out crypto market making on Coinbase and Gemini, The Block reported.

Kelleher noted that the crypto industry wants the CFTC as a watchdog because it’s the smallest regulator with the smallest budget.  Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) released their long-awaited legislation – the Responsible Financial Innovation Act – Tuesday. While it’s not expected to get serious consideration in Congress before next year, it represents a comprehensive and bi-partisan attempt to regulate much of the industry. The bill would favor CFTC as the primary regulator for much of crypto, eliminate taxes on small purchases of goods and services, set rules for stablecoins and establish a regulator-approved “sandbox” for the industry to try innovative products without the worry of government sanctions.  “Too many lawmakers are rushing to introduce legislation that, in the name of fostering innovation, could legitimize bad actors and bad practices,” said Mark Hays, a policy analyst for Americans for Financial Reform. “Just because an industry that pumps millions into the political process claims it is innovative does not mean it deserves its own special rulebook.”  For their part, crypto industry groups applauded the proposal, with Kristin Smith, the executive director of the Blockchain Association, calling it “a major step forward for the crypto industry in Washington.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | COMMODITY | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/07/crypto-bill-condemned-by-consumer-advocates-in-washington,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3d0703787b58b53be2a29c8118a939270f0f9c9a-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420970,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcX6l9J,1654621200,Why Latin American Crypto Exchanges Are Doubling Down on Yield Products,"Latin America, a region characterized by high inflation and unstable economies, is now among the crypto markets with the highest yield rates.  Regional crypto exchanges offer annual rates of up to 15% for users looking to generate interest on their cryptocurrency investments. That's well above the figures provided by global companies in developed markets, where rates usually reach up to 9% per year.  A search of new customers, reinvestment of raised funds and Latin American users’ rising interest in crypto are some of the reasons for regional exchanges’ aggressive yield rates, several firms told CoinDesk.  In April, Bitso, the leading Latin American crypto exchange, launched an earnings yield feature with 15% rates on the USDC, USDP and BUSD stablecoins and up to 6% on bitcoin. The service is available for the company’s 4 million users in the four countries where it operates, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Colombia.  “Latin America is one of the regions with the highest crypto adoption. That enthusiasm is reflected in exchanges’ yield rates,” Bitso policy head Julián Colombo told CoinDesk.  Read more: Why Brazilians Are Turning to Stablecoins Like Tether  To obtain rates of up to 15% on stablecoins, Bitso uses different decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, including liquidity, mining and staking pools, Colombo said, without disclosing details.  Lemon, an Argentine exchange that reached more than 1 million users in May, offers up to 13% interest on DAI and 12% on USDC.  “In Latin American countries like Argentina, people place the U.S. dollar as one of the currencies in which they store value. That is why they find stablecoins as very attractive alternatives,” Santiago Di Paolo, community and research leader at Lemon, told CoinDesk.  Crypto yield rates in Latin America are higher than those on major U.S. exchanges, such as Hodlnaut, Crypto.com, Gemini, Coinbase or Celsius, which offer annual interest of 5% to 9.45% on stablecoins, according to their web pages.  In October 2020, Buenbit, an Argentina-based exchange with operations in Peru and Mexico, became one of the first Latin American companies to start offering earning interest with stablecoins. The platform provides its 700,000 users annual rates of up to 8.25% on DAI by using DeFi protocols like Compound, Agustín Liserra, chief financial officer at Buenbit, told CoinDesk.  “We decided to give users practically all the returns that DeFi offers, to on-board as many people into the crypto world as possible – and at the same time, to be a competitive and attractive product for users who were already interacting with the crypto ecosystem, Liserra said.  Belo, an Argentina exchange with more than 170,000 users, offers annual returns of 8.5% on DAI and USDC, 5.25% on BTC and 4% on ETH.  “Our user base diversifies, especially in the bull markets. Not only people from the crypto world are joining, but from different backgrounds,” Manuel Beaudroit, Belo’s CEO, told CoinDesk.  Changes after Terra’s crash  Still, Terra’s implosion and the bearishness toward the crypto market has affected Latin American exchanges’ yields.  Buenbit and Lemon used to offer up to 18% annual returns to users who staked UST through Anchor. Now, both companies have renamed former UST to USTC on their apps, but its sale, trade and storage remain suspended.  Both companies have listed the new LUNA token and started sending it to those who had previously invested in luna classic (LUNC) and ust classic, they told CoinDesk.  “After Terra crashed, trust in the crypto ecosystem, in general, was eroded a bit,” Liserra said.  Lemon’s Di Paolo said the collapse of Terra ""triggered a scenario where users are more attentive to studying each project before investing their money and are aware of its progress.”  The Terra debacle not only affected the exchanges that listed the UST stablecoin, but also created mistrust among users throughout the Latin American crypto ecosystem, he said.  Bitso, which didn't list the disgraced stablecoin, received questions from its various users, Colombo said. So did Belo, which also didn't list UST.  “For the way the crypto markets usually behave, in a couple of months, if the market goes up, no one is going to remember this,” Belo's Beaudroit said.",POSITIVE,BTC | LUNC | DAI,BTC | EXCHANGE | LUNC | MARKET | DAI,Marina Lammertyn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/07/why-latin-american-crypto-exchanges-are-doubling-down-on-yield-products,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/68f7221901fdfc8332a590f2dbe9588ac1f2d42e-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423155,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2WzPh,1654621184,Crypto Unable to Shake Reputation as Ransomware Tool in Senate Hearing,"The crypto industry again faced damning comments Tuesday about its reputation as an enabler of ransomware, with a Senate hearing examining how hackers continue to request payment in digital assets for their criminal attacks.  ""These malign actors almost exclusively demand cryptocurrencies when extorting large sums of money, because they can take steps to obscure their transactions and circumvent regulatory scrutiny, making payments more difficult to trace,"" said Senator Gary Peters (D-Mich.), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee.  Cryptocurrency advocates have long battled this perception, and the situation hasn't improved, according to witnesses testifying Tuesday.  ""Ransomware actors know they want to cash out their proceeds using the most efficient means,"" said Bill Siegel, the CEO of Coveware, a firm that negotiates with hackers on behalf of their victims. ""Cryptocurrency is the most efficient means. It has great scale. They can move it very quickly across borders. It can be moved without worry of being reclaimed, unless they make an operational security mistake.""  Bitcoin remains dominant, he said, though some bad actors prefer the coins designed to better maintain privacy, such as Monero.  Jackie Burns Koven, the head of cyber threat intelligence at Chainalysis Inc., argued that crypto shouldn't be painted with a broad brush as a shield for anonymity. She described how uniquely transparent the transactions can be, sometimes making it ""much easier"" to track than other types of payment.  She said there were more than $712 million in ransom payments made in 2021. While that’s a record-breaker of a year even as it likely understates the full amount thanks to a lack of reporting, in terms of overall market size it’s pretty negligible – Chainalysis estimates just 0.14% of overall crypto transaction activity was connected to criminality in 2021.  As the testimony took place, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a report released on Tuesday, that the U.S. should share more information about crimes tied to cryptocurrency and help build up its overseas partnerships to help combat them. The report was one of the first responses to President Joe Biden’s executive order mobilizing the federal government to come up with responsible oversight of digital assets.  ""I plan to continue my investigation to further examine the role cryptocurrencies play in these cybercrimes and other criminal activities,"" said Senator Peters, concluding the hearing.",NEGATIVE,없음,MARKET | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/07/crypto-unable-to-shake-reputation-as-ransomware-tool-in-senate-hearing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9b17a79c1e6dbbf3055c3d3288d1d4ac8b34444e-4700x2237.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420972,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcX6lAL,1654620138,DeShone Kizer: From NFL Star to NFT Trailblazer,"It’s 5:30 a.m. in Nashville. I’m here to meet NFL quarterback DeShone Kizer. As a rookie, he played for the Cleveland Browns. He starred at Notre Dame. He’s now 26 and in his prime. He’s healthy, but he’s mysteriously absent from the National Football League (NFL). I’m here to find out why.  Weeks ago I told Kizer, who goes by DK, that I’d join him for his morning regimen, whatever that is. I was game for anything.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Sports Week.  DK had a cryptic response. “If we are going to do this right, then my day begins at 4:45 a.m.”  He told me to wear sneakers.  I braced myself for a high-intensity workout of burpees, push-ups, wind sprints and getting embarrassed by an elite athlete. Maybe I’d run some routes and he’d fling me the football as part of his comeback training?  Nope.  Kizer gets up at 4:45 a.m. because he has a packed day of meetings. He gets up at 4:45 because he’s now the CEO of One of None, a blockchain-based startup that’s trying to bridge the worlds of non-fungible tokens (NFT) and physical collectibles. He gets up at 4:45 a.m. to make time for a long walk around a golf course, clearing his head and listening to venture capital podcasts.  All of this confused me. As recently as last season, Kizer had calls from his NFL agent. He could have been a third-string QB or maybe the backup. At the very least he could collect those juicy NFL paychecks.  But Kizer hasn’t thrown a football in months. He’s not planning on throwing one anytime soon. “It’s over,” he tells me. “The cleats are hung up.”  He knows he can still play. But he found something that excites him more than football. He’s launching what might be the most ambitious project I’ve seen in the crypto space: A way to bring the many perks of NFTs – such as letting creators profit from secondary sales – to the physical world of art and watches and cars and really anything else you can imagine.  Read More: Sports NFTs: How to Get in the Game  “I fell back in love with business,” says Kizer, who has mostly avoided the press during this phase of his career. But today he’s in a mood to tell me everything.  Fighting Irish  It’s bright outside at 5:30 a.m. As we stroll around the park, following a trail that smells of honeysuckle, Kizer calmly shares his story. The first thing I realize: In some ways the business always came before football.  Kizer studied finance at Notre Dame and spent late nights with his roommate, Pat Darché, scarfing down Cheetos while brainstorming business ideas. DK was a freshman quarterback – technically a redshirt – but the NFL wasn’t on his radar. He thought he’d be an entrepreneur. He toyed with the idea of investment banking or a Big 4 accounting firm, but Darché gave him some solid advice: You’re an f’ing quarterback at Notre Dame. You don’t need to take the traditional path. There’s a more creative way.  So on the weekends, as a hobby, Kizer and Darché looked up every Fortune 500 company and identified which CEOs had attended Notre Dame. Then they did the same thing for all the chief operating officers and vice presidents. Kizer sent them cold emails, and he always led with the fact that he played quarterback at Notre Dame and he was looking for advice in business. Not a bad intro. Half the time they didn’t have the email address so they tried every combination of first name and initial and last name. About 80% of those emails bounced back, but a 20% success rate is more than enough. This eventually brought Kizer in touch with the CEO of GE Capital, who helped him create a custom three-week internship that would accommodate his football schedule.  And football seemed like a long shot. Kizer began his sophomore year as a backup to Heisman hopeful Malik Zaire; he wasn’t expected to sniff the field. But when Zaire broke his ankle in the second game, Kizer’s number was called. He kept the team in the game. With 18 seconds left, Notre Dame trailed by one and had the ball near midfield. Too long for a field goal.  In a moment straight out of “Friday Night Lights,” Kizer shuffled back to buy himself time, evaded two defenders who nearly sacked him, and heaved the ball as far as he could. His target was future NFL receiver Will Fuller. And the pass was perfect. “What a throw by Kizer!” the announcer gushed. Fuller streaked into the end zone, the Irish won and DeShone Kizer became the starting quarterback for Notre Dame.  Kizer led the Irish to a 10-2 season – briefly ranked #4 in the nation, and celebrated in a Showtime documentary – even as his mind and heart were tugged in other directions. Kizer’s girlfriend at the time had been diagnosed with a tumor in her neck. To remove 95% of the tumor, she needed a 17-hour operation, surgery that left her partially paralyzed. Kizer and his girlfriend shared updates on a joint blog. “The tumor has been growing in her skull for 8-15 years and in doing so has engulfed nerves 9-12. The only way to remove the tumor included removing the nerves as well,” Kizer wrote. In the same post, he shared that “the doctors noticed that Elli was not able to move her left leg from the knee down. My heart dropped hearing this news.”  More from Sports Week: Micah Johnson: From MLB to NFT Superstar  Somehow Kizer bounced back and forth between caring for his girlfriend and showing up for the team – he’s good at multitasking. And he played well enough to keep his starting job the following season, even after Zaire returned. The NFL scouts noticed. Kizer declared for the NFL draft, getting picked by the Cleveland Browns in the second round. (The three quarterbacks selected before Kizer were Mitchell Trubisky, Deshaun Watson and someone named Patrick Mahomes. “Unbelievable draft pick,” Kizer says now. “They saw what nobody else saw.”)  I dropped everything. I didn’t really talk to anyone. I didn’t really have any friends  The Browns had gone 1-15 the prior year. Normally, as a rookie quarterback, you’re the backup and you have time to learn the ropes. But that’s not what happened. Kizer had such a successful preseason that his coaches named him as the starter, making him one of the youngest starting quarterbacks in the history of the league. In the first quarter of Week 1, he rushed for a touchdown and tied the game at 7-7. The crowd howled in excitement. The Browns are in this thing! This Kizer kid is good! Maybe the Browns – those historic lovable losers – were finally turning things around.  DeShone Kizer was 21 years old and starting for an NFL team. The team looked competitive and the future seemed limitless.  Bunker season  Thanks to that rookie QB contract, Kizer found himself with real money for the first time. He started dabbling in the luxury and collectible space – high-end streetwear like Off-White and Fear of God. He began making friends with artists and designers and creators. The concept of “limited edition” collectibles made immediate sense to him. “Products can drive demand from scarcity,” he says now. “My dad liked classic cars. I understood it.”  And as he dived deeper into the luxury and collectible world, he noticed an unmistakable trend: Whenever collectibles increased in value, the creators themselves rarely benefited. Maybe a limited-edition sneaker costs $200. Then a year later, it sells for $1,000 on a secondary market. The artist sees exactly 0 cents of that $800 in profit. Kizer keeps notebooks where he scribbles down ideas, and he noted this as something to revisit in the future.  But first he had to focus on football. It’s true that in his first NFL start, Kizer tied the game at 7-7 and the Browns fans were hyped. But then they went on to lose the game. Then they lost the second game. Third game. Fourth.  As Kizer struggled to pick up his first W, he cocooned himself in the world of football. “I dropped everything,” he says as we stroll through the Nashville park. No thoughts about entrepreneurship. No ideas about collectibles. “I didn’t really talk to anyone. I didn’t really have any friends.” Some days he showed up at 5 a.m. – hours before the rest of the team – to practice throwing every single pass in the playbook.  During the NFL regular season, Tuesdays are the players’ only true off day. Many spend it playing Call of Duty or Madden, or maybe hopping on a flight to Vegas for some less PG fun. Kizer spent his Tuesdays visiting University Hospitals, where he met with its pediatric cancer team and said hello to the children. “That was like my reset,” he says.  Still the losses mounted. By Week 8, it started to feel like “the same old Browns,” and in Week 10, he was benched for Kevin Hogan. The Browns lost that game so Kizer was reinstalled as the starter. Then they lost again. And again. And again. When the dust settled, the Browns finished 0-16, one of the worst teams in NFL history.  Read More: NHL Partners With Sweet to Offer Digital Collectibles, NFTs  It’s hard to pin that on Kizer, as they went 1-15 the year before and struggled at virtually every position. But still he was traded to Green Bay to back up Aaron Rodgers as quarterback, and maybe that’s how he should have started his career all along – a chance to learn the system without the immediate pressure of carrying a team.  Kizer watched Aaron Rodgers carefully. He picked up on the small things. “He throws the ball better than anyone I’ve ever seen in my life, but on top of that, he maintains his intellectual integrity,” says Kizer, who was impressed that Rodgers could fluently speak about business and history and Jeopardy “and then get out there on the field and just spin it.” Prior to this, Kizer thought he had to separate the two worlds. He couldn’t be both “the Notre Dame intellect and also a good football player.”  But maybe he could do both?  For the next few years, Kizer thought more about entrepreneurship as he bounced around the league as a backup, first for the Raiders. Then came COVID-19. In the spring of 2020, Kizer had just been cut by the Las Vegas Raiders and the NFL was on lockdown. “I couldn’t go on a workout. I couldn’t go on a visit,” he says. “There was no movement in free agency.” His agent told him to hang tight, as at the time, they didn’t even know if the NFL would be playing a 2020 football season.  So to pass the time he cracked open his business journal and reviewed his old notes. He came back to an idea that was double-circled: helping creators gain access to the resale royalties of their products. This seemed to have legs. He did more brainstorming and banged out some PowerPoint slides and then he called up his old college roommate, Pat Darché, and pitched him an idea: What if you could connect the retail and the resale of limited edition items?  Darché was intrigued. They fleshed out the concept over a series of long phone calls. The idea was to create a platform and marketplace for both creators and collectors. Maybe the product could launch on the same platform that would host the secondary sales? This way, the creator could still get a cut. And it would somehow track the provenance (authentic identity) of a collectible over time. They would do this, in part, by aggregating bits of social media evidence.  For example, let’s say you’re tracking a high-end Supreme watch. Maybe the owner is actor George Clooney. Then Clooney wears it courtside to a Lakers game and it’s tagged on Instagram. This would all be part of the watch’s provenance, which would of course be linked to the resale value. “It was very ambitious and kind of crazy,” says Kizer. “I loved it.”  Kizer and Darché (who’s now One of None’s co-founder and chief operating officer) knew they had a dizzying number of logistics to solve – just how do you track the provenance, exactly? How do you link the digital identity to a physical watch? Should they be getting into the business of actually storing and securing high-end collectibles? It wasn’t a simple idea.  When football returned in 2020, Kizer kept working on One of None. He was re-signed by the Raiders and served as their “Quarantine Quarterback,” meaning he would Zoom into meetings from a hotel, keeping himself socially distanced from the team in case Derek Carr or Marcus Mariota caught COVID-19.  So while the rest of the Raiders practiced on the field, Kizer had some extra time to call Darché and keep developing One of None. And this I find truly inspirational and even relatable. During the pandemic, much of the nation took advantage of remote working – and the extra time it afforded – to expand a side hustle. Kizer also used remote work to explore a side hustle; he just happened to do it as an NFL quarterback.  By this time, Kizer and Darché had moved past the early brainstorming phase. By now,they had identified the missing ingredient that could connect the dots and make all of this possible: blockchain. Years ago, Kizer had been skeptical of blockchain and crypto, but now he realized it was the exact solution for his problem. After doing more research, he realized that “blockchain was a no brainer.” They brought onboard a third co-founder, Mike Darché (Pat’s older brother), to lead the tech and blockchain side of the equation.  The bunker session didn’t really have much football in it. I just fell back in love with business  The 2021 season approached. Now Kizer was competing for a backup spot with the Tennessee Titans. During the off-season, before the OTAs (organized team activities), Kizer and Pat Darché again became roommates and went into “bunker season” – sometimes staying up till 4 a.m. – to get as much done as possible before the grind of training camp.  The football suffered. “I’ll be the first to say it,” he says now. “The bunker session didn’t really have much football in it.” He spent the first week of the Titans training camp just knocking off the rust. He gave it his best effort – he always does – but his heart was elsewhere. “I just fell back in love with business,” he says, adding that if you look at the last six pages of his Titans player notebook, “all you’re seeing is One of None notes.”  Kizer was cut when the Titans went with Matt Barkley, and now he needed to make the hard decision. One of None as a side hustle was no longer tenable. He needed time to raise capital and properly launch the business. He needed to prioritize One of None.  He would later receive more calls and offers to join an NFL team. At the time, he was only 25. It’s true he hadn’t started a game in years, but it’s also true that he’s still part of an extraordinarily small group of elite athletes who are in the top 0.0000001% of what they do, and he could keep doing it for years and keep collecting NFL paychecks.  Instead he said, No thanks. I’m good.  Because ultimately, at the end of the day, he has a better opportunity.  And now he takes me to the One of None headquarters to show me just what, exactly, his team has been cooking.  Game time  Limited edition sneakers. Luxury T-shirts. A skateboard emblazoned with the image of basketball legend Kobe Bryant.  Collectibles like this are displayed throughout the two-floor residential headquarters of One of None, and it’s a reminder that the company is focused on stuff. Things. Physical objects.  When Kizer began researching the art market, the first thing he learned is that “the number one driver of value is provenance.” If you can track the provenance of art from its initial sale to the next person to the next person, it can retain value. As soon as there’s a gap in the provenance, the value plummets.  We’re bridging the gap between the physical and the digital in a way that no one has done before  With NFTs, the solution is simple. Blockchain tracks its identity from inception. But how to apply that same concept to physical goods? This is what Kizer and his team have spent the last two years trying to crack – this is why he gets up at 4:45 a.m. and goes to bed by 9 p.m. and has only touched alcohol six times since 2020. This is why he has no hobbies except work.  And they think they have the solution.  As Kizer explains to me using examples in the office – like the Kobe skateboard – One of None creates a “hybrid NFT” that links the physical to the digital. The real skateboard would have a skateboard NFT. The concept of “digital twins” is not new. But Kizer’s trick is to work with creators at inception to wed the Real Skateboard to the Skateboard NFT using a vault – an actual vault in the real world.  Let’s say you buy the Kobe Skateboard for $100. On the One of None platform you’ll receive both the skateboard and the NFT. You can choose whether to keep the skateboard in the vault or to redeem it – sort of like checking a book out of a library. When your skateboard is locked in the vault, you’re free to sell the Skateboard NFT. But when you’ve “redeemed” the skateboard and proudly display it in your living room, you’re not permitted to sell the NFT. This ensures that the NFT and the underlying asset stay connected, avoiding any gaps in provenance. Or as Pat Darché describes it, “We’re bridging the gap between the physical and the digital in a way that no one has done before.”  The vault is a big part of this equation. And it raises a question: Would people actually want to keep their stuff in some random vault? Don’t people want to keep the sneakers, and skateboards, and watches in their own homes? Maybe not. After analyzing the collectible market, Kizer had a hunch that when people buy luxury sneakers or even artwork, many of them simply hope it appreciates in value – they don’t need it in their closet.  As an early experiment, Kizer gave away 115 T-shirts – with designs from the artist Blake Jamieson – that were valued at around $30. He gave people the choice. Did they want to take the t-shirts home or keep it in the One of None vault?  “I’m just curious,” he says to me. “What would you guess? What percentage of people would you guess would want to vault it?”  Honestly? I thought the answer might be 0%, but to be polite I said, “I’m thinking low, 10%?”  Kizer had the same guess. He thought it might be around 5% to 10%.  We were both wrong.  “Forty percent,” says Kizer. “Forty percent of our collectors decided that they’re going to value the t-shirt and treat it like it was going to be an asset.” And when they tried the same experiment for skate decks, 60% chose to keep them in the vaults. Kizer knew he was onto something. It’s one of the reasons he left the NFL. He couldn’t get those stats out of his head when practicing with the Titans: 40% chose the vault! “That was our validation,” says Kizer. “This is real. People know what NFTs are. They understand the concept of vaulting. And they’re taking this t-shirt and they’re thinking of it as the same way of an NFT, as an asset.”  But the physical world can be a beast. One of the selling points of NFTs, after all, is that they’re infinitely easier to store and track and transfer than t-shirts or skateboards. So Kizer threw himself into the arcana of logistics – shipping, tracking, security, storage. The nuts and bolts are almost hilariously daunting. If you redeem your Kobe Skateboard from the vault, what prevents you from swapping it with a cheap knockoff, and then vaulting the fake and selling the real one?  One of None installs RFID chips (radio-frequency identification) into the actual physical objects, then those RFID chips interact with the blockchain and the sensors at their storage vaults. (Much of this technology already exists from the high-end art storage and security world, and they’re working with a third party to handle the logistics.)  Kizer knows this is tricky and that he could have done something simpler. Something with a cushy payout. “Imagine my athlete network that I had during early 2021,” he says, knowing that the NFT market was on fire. They could have dropped NFTs and made a quick buck. Or they could have launched One of None sooner. Instead he wanted to embrace the complexity. “I know it’s a lot,” he says. “That’s why we’ve been building for two years. This isn’t some garage startup.”  After Kizer’s morning walks, much of his days are spent on the phone with artists and creators, explaining the concept and floating ways they could work together. He always viewed this as a tool for creators. Part of their pitch is a platform that has tools for creators to collaborate and invent new types of physical or digital merch – they even have step-by-step tutorials on ways to structure limited edition drops. And maybe more importantly, Kizer knows that if there’s nothing cool on the site, no one will use it.  So he’s collaborating with artists like The Ghost, Fuzi, and Art Mobb. (Just as Kizer felt emboldened to email CEOs as a Notre Dame freshman, now he has the cachet to open social doors.) Take the example of Hoop Dream Studio. They somehow turn the backboards of basketball hoops into works of art. They’re cool but they’re bulky. Physical. Very difficult to “put on the blockchain.” But One of None is working with Hoop Dream Studio to create hybrid NFTs for the backboards, install RFID chips, and then store the backboards in their vault.  That’s an example of One of None working with a “legacy” (i.e., physical) artist and bringing them into Web 3. They’re also doing the reverse. For purely NFT and digital artists, One of None is helping to create physical merchandise. Take Knights of Degen, a sports-themed metaverse project. Kizer brokered a collaboration between Knights of Degen and Ice Games, which makes arcade games. Ice Games is building a custom-made Knights of Degen arcade game (a “pop-a-shot” hoops game) that will also exist as an NFT, and it can either be stored in the One of None vault or redeemed for playing.  This arcade game sort of epitomizes Kizer’s style: embracing whatever is the most challenging. It’s a stress test of the One of None model. If they can solve the shipping and storage logistics of an arcade game NFT, then t-shirts and watches are a snap. “They’re heavy. They’re big. And they’re challenging on the infrastructure side,” says Kizer. But they’ve figured out a way to do it. “If a pop-a-shot can sit in our vault in Virginia, and change hands 10 times over six months without ever leaving our vault. Why can’t you do that with a car?”  And this gets to the endgame. There’s a reason that Kizer is courting all the complexity of the physical world – it leads to a bigger pie. If there are 1 million people who care about digital art and NFTs, there are 100 million who care about actual things like watches and sneakers and cars. The reality is that most people still care about reality. And the way Kizer sees it, “I’m more interested in the 100 million than the 1 million.”  More from Sports Week: How DAOs Could Change Sports  If everything breaks right? Collaborations with artists could snowball into collabs with Rolex. “That is the vision,” says Kizer. “The Porches. The Rolexes. The Ferraris. The Louis Vuittons. The Diors. Those are the businesses that have taken luxury and limited edition and have turned it into an experience unlike any other.”  One of None has been in stealth mode, but it will unveil their goods at NFT.NYC later in June. This is the coming out party. In a weekly staff meeting (the larger team has grown to 12), at the end of updates about inventory and artist deals and the platform status, Kizer gives something of a pep talk.  “I’m going to wrap this up by saying that this has been two years of my life,” says Kizer, and left unspoken is that he has essentially sacrificed an NFL career for this. The stakes are real. And at NFT.NYC, those two years of work will be suddenly on display. “It’s a soft launch event,” he says, his voice calm and clear and steady. “It’s not the end all be all. If this thing fails, we don’t fail. We can definitely survive past what happens at NFT.NYC.”  Short pause.  “That being said,” Kizer continues, “There’s a lot of freaking hours that are going into this week. I would just ask that if you have any sort of loyalty towards One of None. Whatever that extra piece is, whatever that extra idea is, whatever that extra time or effort or energy you can put into these next four weeks – please join me in it. Know that I’m here working just as hard.”  It’s a good speech. It feels honest. It feels earned. It feels like the pregame speech of a quarterback.  Because the game of One of None is about to start, and Kizer is now, finally, ready to take the field.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/07/deshone-kizer-from-nfl-star-to-nft-trailblazer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2d9a20bcc727edd4735de9925a242ca93b638ddd-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

For the past 3 weeks, the BNB price has been moving in a narrow consolidation corridor and has not responded to Bitcoin provocations. However, sellers did not release the BNB price above the critical points for the downward trend. As a result of weak but confident and systematic pressure from sellers, the BNB price on 6 June did not keep and broke the local resistance zone of $290 down. Globally, the situation has not changed in the weekly timeframe. Source: https://www.tradingview.com/x/HQemTTU4/ Moreover, in the previous article we expected the $262 fall and test to continue. It is from the $262 range that it is safer to buy BNB cryptocurrency for a medium-term price rebound with a first target of $335. Why such modest targets? The BNB price from November 2021 is in a downward trend. Until buyers fix above the red trend line and show a willingness to keep the BNB price - to predict large price movements up is still meaningless. The global critical point for the downward trend is $380. After punching it up and keeping it after the local correction, you can safely declare a change in the trend in the BNB market. In the meantime, we should be satisfied with small price rebounds from strong liquidity levels.

Theoretically, argued the report, the total addressable market (TAM) of the metaverse should be calculated by adding all internet-related revenue to that of the physical-world activities being displaced.  Citi identified early investment opportunities in five important building blocks: 1) Operating systems connecting people and content; 2) Blockchain that decentralizes economic systems and ownership of digital assets; 3) Natural user interfaces e.g., voice control and gestures for greater user immersion; 4) extended reality (XR) headsets; 5) Cloud networking infrastructure.  Among the long list of stocks poised to benefit are the usual suspects, such as Meta (FB), Apple (APPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and Intel (INTC), but also telcos, including Verizon (VZ), T-Mobile (TMUS) and AT&T (T), according to the report.  The bank cautions, however, that with the metaverse still in the early stage of development, there are a plethora of risks and challenges in technology, regulation, privacy and crypto that need to be overcome before widespread adoption takes place.

(MIGI) has taken a 33% stake in Tasmania Data Infrastructure (TDI) in exchange for about 1,975 bitcoin mining rigs.  TDI is developing a data center in Tasmania, Australia, to mine bitcoin (BTC) with 100% renewable energy and will have up to 35 megawatts (MW) of energy infrastructure available in the third quarter, with expansion capacity in excess of 100MW, according to a statement.  “By exchanging a portion of our ASIC Bitcoin Mining fleet for an equity position in TDI, we have continued to demonstrate our capital discipline whilst obtaining a meaningful equity position in one of Australia’s largest emerging, 100% renewable energy bitcoin miners,” said Mawson CEO and founder James Manning.  The move comes as miners are becoming increasingly conservative with their capital spending amid the plunge in cryptocurrency prices. Many have begun tapping alternative sources of funds to help their businesses grow, including selling their mined digital assets to pay for operating expenses.  As part of the deal, Mawson will have the right to host up to 10MW of its own bitcoin mining infrastructure at the site and provide TDI a license to utilize Mawson’s Modular Data Center (MDC) and associated technology.  The shares of Mawson outperformed mining peers today, rising more than 7%. However, the stock has fallen about 67% this year, in line with the performance of other public mining companies.

Eric Ma, CMO of Deeper Network, said there’s a massive void for cybersecurity networks at home and on the road. Companies already invest millions of dollars in security for their offices. However, as soon as people return home or travel on the road, vulnerabilities in people’s technologies persist and make it possible for sensitive information to get leaked.  This article is part of Road to Consensus.  Deeper Network is one of eight finalists in the inaugural Web 3 Pitch Fest, which is being hosted by Extreme Tech Challenge and CoinDesk and is part of the Consensus festival, which is being held June 9-12 in Austin, Texas. With the startup’s plug-and-play working product that links to other nodes globally, people have a decentralized virtual private network (VPN) that offers enterprise-grade cybersecurity through seven layers of firewall protection.  This was especially helpful when Ma was in Hong Kong during the Umbrella Movement.  Even though the Chinese government was cracking down on people’s access to the internet, Ma was able to use Deeper Network’s device to connect to the web, giving him the freedom and security to browse as he pleased.  “It’s great to be one of the few in the [Web 3] space with an actual working product,” Ma said in an interview with CoinDesk.  The advantages of Deeper Network’s decentralized private network with currently 70,000 nodes include peer-to-peer bandwidth sharing to protect one’s privacy and users becoming their own VPN clients and servers.  “Web 2 is on its way out, and Web 3 is the answer,” Ma said. “Right now, [with] Web 2, all the conglomerates own everything, and with Web 3, we’re going to be our own services, get paid for it and everything will be safer, more secure and more private.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA,Sage D.

The move will help developers building on Circle automate flows from fiat into Polygon USDC, along with being able to swap it for native USDC across various blockchain networks.  Polygon USDC is a bridged version of USDC, as opposed to a native implementation such as is issued on blockchains including Algorand, Avalanche, Ethereum, Flow, Hedera, Solana, Stellar and Tron.  Adding Polygon USDC marks the first time a bridged version of the stablecoin has been supported on the platform.  ""Polygon is an attractive entry point for businesses and developers to build in an established and liquid ecosystem with faster settlement times and reduced costs,"" Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said. ""Supporting Polygon USDC in the Circle Account and Circle APIs is another step toward making USDC interoperable across more leading blockchains, helping foster greater adoption for dollar digital currency on the internet.""  Circle's USDC stablecoin has over $54 billion in circulation, according to the statement.

The move away from regimented custodial platforms towards more open systems is a trend being followed by other large fintech players to enter crypto, such as popular trading app Robinhood, which is rolling out a new crypto wallet focused on decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  It was back at CoinDesk’s virtual Consensus event in 2021 that Jose Fernandez da Ponte, senior vice president, blockchain, crypto and digital currencies at PayPal, said plans to let users move their coins to third-party wallets were in the works.  “We are definitely responding to demand from users, that is one aspect,” said da Ponte in an interview this week. “We’ve also been very vocal from the beginning that we’re in this because we are a payments and commerce company, and we think that our role in the ecosystem is about increasing access.”  The ability to move bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), bitcoin cash (BCH) and litecoin (LTC) from PayPal’s crypto platform to external wallets is available from Tuesday to select U.S. users (not in Hawaii) and rolling out to all eligible U.S. customers in the coming weeks, according to a blog post.  When PayPal first announced its move into digital assets, it seemed to kick-start a bull run in the crypto markets. By allowing its customers to send and receive crypto, PayPal has become the world’s largest blockchain-enabled consumer digital wallet, according to Walter Hessert, head of strategy at Paxos, an infrastructure provider to PayPal.  In a statement, he said the platform was “a monumental step in the mainstream adoption of digital assets and Web3.”  PayPal down the rabbit hole  Asked about predictions for increased use of the platform in light of the new transfer functionality, “the early signs in terms of demand are very promising,” da Ponte said.  “I don’t know if it’s going to be about the absolute number of users, or it’s going to be more about folks continuing to move in the adoption cycle,” he said, adding: “We have a ton of people now who have adopted the basic product, and as they grow, they want to do more things.

Key technical points: The XLM market value decreased by 7.58% today at press time. The price action shows a high likelihood of a retracement to $0.11. The 24-hour trading volume of Stellar is $206 Million, indicating a hike of 15%. Past Performance of XLM XLM prices generated a long-coming, highly bearish resistance trendline due to the falling trend started after the failure to surpass the $0.25 mark. The falling trend takes support at the $0.11 mark to form a double bottom pattern with a neckline at $0.15. However, the breakout attempt fails due to the high supply resistance trendline, 50-day EMA, and horizontal level. Source- Tradingview XLM Technical Analysis XLM prices showcase a diagonal trend close to the confluence of resistance levels displaying a bullish refusal against depreciation. Hence, traders can expect a delay in the trendline breakout but the daily candle turning bearish increases the likelihood of a downslide to $0.11. The falling EMAs maintain a bearish alignment representing a solid correction phase in motion. Moreover, the 50-day EMA (red) provides resistance to the bullish recovery.

42394234,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvZhV3,1654614843,Preparing for the Dreaded Down Round,"Venture capitalists (VCs), like crypto retail traders, essentially invest based on gut instinct.  Sometimes this process is called “momentum,” as in a growing company or an appreciating coin is sure to do well if it has been doing well. Sometimes VCs or traders might establish standards and check to see if they’re met before investing in a project. In venture capital, this might be called “due diligence;” in crypto, it’s doing your own research.  Investing clearly has a psychological component. And few things are worse for individual companies or broad-based market sentiment than when startups start raising “down rounds.”  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  “In Silicon Valley venture financing, a ‘down round’ is to be avoided at all costs,” the Wall Street Journal has boldly proclaimed. “Startups worry that the damage of down round is far-reaching for recruiting efforts, existing employee morale, customers and partners.”  Down rounds are when a company raises capital at a lower valuation. It means that the stock price paid in previous investing rounds has declined.  Yesterday, Frank Chaparro at The Block reported that crypto lender BlockFi is set to raise an undisclosed amount of money at a $1 billion valuation, down from its previous round when it was valued at $3 billion.  This is the largest profile down round to have occurred since the beginning of the crypto market’s downcycle. It speaks to the bearish mood, imminent monetary tightening and a likely pull back in venture capital financing that has acted as an accelerant for token markets.  Chaparro called it “a striking development” considering the “high degree of venture capital activity only months before.”  In BlockFi’s case, it might also speak to the regulatory uncertainty around its core business after paying a $100 million penalty to several securities regulators regarding a high-yield lending product.  Yet, BlockFi is still a unicorn, or a private company with a $1 billion valuation. At the beginning of the year, there were more than 900 such companies – a smattering of them in crypto – compared to 80 total in 2015, according to CBInsights.  It seems likely that further down rounds in crypto will follow, if only because people keep thinking about it. The perception of momentum affects both startups and markets. At a startup, a down round could be demoralizing for employees as it might feel like a step backwards.  See also: Are Exchange Layoffs the First Sign of Crypto Winter, or Is It Already Over? | Opinion  It might also signal to outside investors that a business’ outlook isn’t great – that it could even shut down. Measuring this is difficult, as private companies are under no obligation to share financial data publicly.  In markets, a bearish mood could make it harder for newer startups to get funded. Then again, because crypto startups can literally print money, the mechanisms are a little different.  Periods of down rounds are not rare and appear cyclically. The last period where more companies were raising down than up occurred at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. But TechCrunch also covered the phenomenon as a trend in 2015 and 2018. An optimist would see these as momentary checks on irrational exuberance.  Stay afloat  If CoinDesk wrote about traditional tech markets, this might be the point where we offer sage advice to “smart founders” looking to mitigate downturns. We might talk about checking to see how much runway you need to get to profitability and raising that amount if you don’t have it on hand – even with the stigma of a down round. (But check your “anti-dilution” clauses first!)  We might also talk about being realistic: When markets are exuberant, and its investors are practically throwing money away, you can raise money on pretty favorable terms. Now, you might expect to give up a board seat or to hear more about strategy and direction from investors. If you have to listen to a veteran investor to stay afloat, you must.  See also: How to Make Money From the Crypto Backlash | Opinion  We might say something like, “flat rounds are the new up round.” Or “the best thing would be to have raised yesterday.” Or list the multi-billion dollar public companies that previously “lost momentum” by taking a down round.  It’s not that down rounds do not matter in crypto or that its investors are any less psychological. But the idea of a firm is entirely different if you want to build actually decentralized businesses and protocols. So my only advice is, maybe you shouldn’t take venture financing in the first place.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/06/07/preparing-for-the-dreaded-down-round,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e4dcf274d98c38d7cfea5614a4c4bbcbd47d7666-2048x1366.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""Strong international law enforcement cooperation will be essential to best position the United States and its partners to detect, investigate, prosecute, and otherwise disrupt criminal activity related to digital assets, and to overcome the unique obstacles posed by the features of these technologies,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a letter included within the Tuesday report. Garland said his agency is pressing for “expanding our operational and capacity building efforts with international partners; increasing information sharing, coordination, and deconfliction; and closing regulatory gaps across jurisdictions.”  In March, Biden signed the order that directed various government agencies to figure out what problems need to be solved in overseeing crypto and to come back with recommendations to fix them. The order gave the attorney general six months to come back with ""a report on the role of law enforcement agencies in detecting, investigating, and prosecuting criminal activity related to digital assets."" This response came significantly early.  Building up the resources devoted outside the U.S. ""could permit more effective law enforcement information sharing and could ensure the formation of the types of long-term collaborations between law enforcement personnel that can critically advance investigations and prosecutions,"" according to the report's recommendations, which also suggest direct funding support for foreign partners.  The report additionally pushed for encouraging other countries to adopt emerging standards meant to combat money laundering. Poor systems in many nations present ""an opportunity for criminal actors to engage in jurisdictional arbitrage, purposely seeking to further their criminal activities in such jurisdictions.""

In a civil suit filed Monday in Federal district court, the South Dakota-based company pointed the finger squarely at Gemini for a hack that’s left dozens of retirement savers in disarray. Some of its clients previously told CoinDesk they had picked IRA Financial largely because of its association with the Winklevoss twins’ name-brand crypto exchange.  The IRA Financial complaint alleges that Gemini failed to protect its clients’ assets, claiming that a series of security steps all failed once thieves exploited IRA Financial’s “master key” on Feb. 8.  “IRA has since learned – the hard way, as explained below – that whoever possesses the master key can bypass all the supposed security protections,” the complaint said. “Gemini never informed IRA about the power of this master key.”  “We reject the allegations in the lawsuit,” a Gemini spokesperson told ConDesk. “Our security standards are among the highest in the industry and we are constantly updating them to ensure our customers are always protected. In this matter as soon as IRA Financial notified us of their security incident we acted quickly to mitigate the loss of funds from their accounts.”  Heist details  The lawsuit sheds little light on how thieves got a hold of the master key but it does corroborate CoinDesk’s February reporting that a SWAT team descended on IRA Finanical’s headquarters on the day of the hack.  “The police later informed IRA that they believe the call was a ruse to distract IRA employees,” the complaint said.

The announcement comes as Argo's stock has been sliding on the London Stock Exchange over the past six months, with other publicly-traded miners experiencing a similar downturn as bitcoin has declined sharply in value and margins have tightened. Even though Argo upgraded its hashrate outlook for the year in April, it saw a 25% drop in bitcoin mined in May.  The ePIC partnership is an extension of a 2021 deal in which Argo Blockchain agreed to buy $8 million worth of ePIC's mining rigs, CEO Peter Wall said in a taped message posted on Argo's YouTube channel on Tuesday.  Wall compared building custom mining machines to buying a Dell computer as opposed to an Apple MacBook, saying it's cheaper on a dollar per terahash basis and allows Argo to have granular control of the rigs.  ""It's a game changer,"" the CEO said in the video.  Intel's mining semiconductors could break an effective duopoly on the mining rig market in which two manufacturers – Bitmain and MicroBT – reign supreme.  Block (SQ), Griid Infrastructure and Hive Blockchain (HIVE) are set to be the first customers for Intel's new mining chips.

42423159,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2WzVh,1654610101,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Dumps Below $30K as Morgan Stanley Calls Out Liquidity Pressures,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Bradley Keoun, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights. (Lyllah Ledesma is off.)  Price Point: Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies were tumbling on Tuesday, quickly losing what had seemed to be a fresh burst of momentum on the prior day.  Market Moves: The Wall Street firm Morgan Stanley steps back and assesses the liquidity pressures recently hitting crypto markets, Will Canny reports.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) was dumping on Tuesday, just a day after a price push past $31,500 kindled hopes that recently slumping cryptocurrency prices might have hit a bottom.  ""The market dynamics this Tuesday morning are a reminder that the market cannot now rally again as it did in 2020,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email. ""In our view, the bitcoin bear market is not over yet.""  As of press time, the largest cryptocurrency was changing hands around $29,400, down 6% in the past 24 hours.  More than $200 million worth of positions on derivative exchanges were liquidated in the past 24 hours, according to Coinglass, CoinDesk's Oliver Knight reported.  Katie Stockton, managing partner of the technical-analysis firm Fairlead Strategies, wrote in a report that ""long-term momentum remains to the downside,"" with support seen at $27,200.  Cryptocurrencies sold off broadly on Tuesday. Among the biggest losers were Solana's SOL token (-13%), Avalanche's AVAX (-13%) and Cosmos' ATOM (-9.7%).  The slide in bitcoin came as U.S. stock futures tumbled in overnight trading. There are renewed fears among investors of more central-bank monetary-policy tightening to control inflation.  Gold was higher, around $1,849 an ounce, and crude oil was holding steady at $118 a barrel.  Market moves  The Wall Street firm Morgan Stanley says crypto is getting hit by shrinking liquidity, Will Canny reports for CoinDesk.  Weakness in crypto markets, the failure of a dollar stablecoin and a reduction in leverage in decentralized finance (DeFi) are resulting in the “crypto equivalent of quantitative tightening,” Morgan Stanley (MS) said in a report Tuesday.  The recent collapse of stablecoin terraUSD (UST) saw tether (USDT) also lose its dollar peg intraday, and this caused crypto prices to drop further as some questioned the stability of the third-largest cryptocurrency, the bank said.  Investors are redeeming USDT at a record pace, the bank said. Some $10.6 billion of redemptions occurred in the last month alone, while other stablecoin issuance is not rising.  “Systemic spillover” risks from the crypto markets to the fiat banking system appear limited, the bank said, because the leveraged crypto companies usually borrow from each other. However, if USDT falls materially under its $1 peg, this would have a larger negative impact on crypto and risk markets.

The new product, Apifiny Algo, is a collection of prewritten C++ programs for accessing coin data, placing orders and executing trades in time-sensitive markets, CEO Haohan Xu told CoinDesk. It’s targeted at the growing cadre of crypto-curious institutional traders who would otherwise build their code from scratch.  “Today, most of the quant traders who are looking to do the same thing, they’ll go on GitHub, find some open-source code someone’s already written,” Xu said. But that system is “probably not perfect.” They still have to retrofit the code, test it, vet it and hope it's fast enough to retain an edge, he said.  By contrast, Xu said Apifiny Algo is optimized for high-performance trading and speed. It plugs into Binance, Binance.US, FTX, Huobi, OKX and Okcoin crypto exchanges, he said.  The new product comes as Apifiny looks ahead to go public via a planned special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deal scheduled to close later this year. It would become a rare crypto company trading on U.S. public markets, alongside Coinbase, whose stock has been hammered and is down nearly 80% since launch.  “Based on the latest progress, we are anticipating to finish the process and be listed in Q3,” Xu said of the firm’s listing plans. “As we inch towards becoming a public company, partnerships with exchanges like Okcoin will help us complete our ecosystem for professional traders.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/07/apifiny-courts-quant-traders-with-crypto-code-library,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/778b8b797d75026c2897edfad5a5bd64a584ed4d-1200x770.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The round valued MachineFi at $100 million.  The funding will go toward platform development, hiring and potentially the incubation of early-stage projects building on the platform, MachineFi Lab CEO and founder Dr. Raullen Chai told CoinDesk in an interview.  MachineFi was launched last year by the team behind IoTeX, a blockchain that connects IoT devices, such as cameras and sensors, to dapps. The connection of real-world devices to blockchain data could have a wide range of use cases, but could prove particularly valuable for bringing the metaverse into the real world, and vice versa.  IoTeX already powers some real-world devices, including blockchain-powered cameras and the Pebble device for supply chain management, according to the website. The blockchain boasts over 10,000 connected devices.  Other investors in the round included Hashkey Capital, IOSG, Escape Velocity, Goodwater Capital, Xoogler Ventures, Wemade, Hanwha, Alpha Grep, DHVC, Vista Lab, Ribbit Angel Fund and NewBuild VC, among others.  MachineFi offers a full infrastructure suite, including an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchain, multichain crypto wallet, blockchain bridge, an onboarding platform and software development kits (SDKs). The suite helps developers create dapps and machine networks.  ""Building on the IoTeX infrastructure, MachineFi Lab jump-starts the large-scale decentralized machine networks. It incentivizes the deployment of machines and the financialization of smart devices and machines' utility and data. And it enables their self-evolving governance,"" Chai said in the press release.  MachineFi plans to keep building out its core platform with a focus on new verticals such as cell phone location/geolocation. Future potential use cases include real-world equivalents of “play-to-earn,"" including sleep-to-earn and drive-to-earn, Chai told CoinDesk.  The idea of data collection isn’t always welcome in Web 3 circles, so Chai noted that users can switch data sharing on or off at any time.  “We implement a switch for users called DID [Decentralized Identity],” he said. “Users can choose to turn on the switch by opening up access to their data for a certain dapp and get back some rewards or tokens … but users can also switch it off. It’s all up to the user.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/07/machinefi-lab-raises-10m-to-incentivize-iot-data-collection-for-web-3,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/91ad8919531fca019f090acf7f36af13a034d890-1250x1041.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The report contended that as transactions per block get close to their limit, the cost of transactions rises, causing users to seek alternative blockchains. This “fragmentation” means blockchains cannot harness the beneficial network effects associated with traditional money.  Money, the report's authors wrote, is a coordination device meant to facilitate economic exchange and that can happen only if there are network effects where the money is continually made more attractive as more people use it. Without interoperability between competing blockchains, cryptocurrencies cannot fulfill that role.  Not a fan of Bitcoin or crypto in general, the BIS, which is an organization that represents the world's major central banks, has been advancing its own research into central bank digital currencies and recently completed project Dunbar in which the central banks of Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and South Africa found that cross-border CBDC efforts were viable.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | RESEARCH,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/07/bis-economists-contend-crypto-cannot-fulfill-the-role-of-money,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7fa5114687b11820c24d1c7a7a9b008b567f07d5-5095x3397.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The new Ball Multicoin Bitwise Metaverse Index will include up to 40 crypto assets and a corresponding fund tracking the performance of the index will be offered through Bitwise.  The metaverse, a term that loosely describes a combination of virtual reality, augmented reality and the internet, appears to be the hottest segment in crypto by measure of institutional attention and dollars.  Last year, social media giant Facebook rebranded to Meta Platforms, and last month, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz closed a $600 million gaming and metaverse fund.  ""The metaverse is one of the most audacious and exciting ideas ever conceived,” said Kyle Samani, managing partner at Multicoin Capital. “With literally thousands of crypto assets to choose from, underwriting the most investable opportunities is a never-ending challenge.”  Samani and Ball will serve on the index committee, alongside Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan and several others, according to a person familiar with the matter. The committee will determine which crypto assets to include in the index and their specific weighting.  “The index draws on a list of liquid crypto assets that pass a series of risk screens to ensure that they are appropriate for professional investors,” Ball said. “Those screens include items related to custody, liquidity, technological and regulatory risk, as well as screens like developer activity, revenues and fit to the metaverse category.”  The new partnership comes amid a sharp downturn in metaverse-related tokens with The Sandbox’s SAND token down 77% and Decentraland’s MANA token down 70%, compared with bitcoin’s 38% decline, year to date.  “Our investors believe that the Metaverse is inevitable and that blockchain-based protocols will be essential to its success,” Ball told CoinDesk. “The current downturn does not impact that conviction, except perhaps to make it an even more desirable investment.”  According to a press release, the Ball Multicoin Bitwise Metaverse Index Fund is available to select investors, with a $100,000 minimum investment and monthly redemptions.",POSITIVE,MANA,BTC | BUSINESS | MANA | MARKET | SPONSORED,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/07/multicoin-capital-partners-with-bitwise-and-matthew-ball-for-metaverse-crypto-index-fund,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ed51b653344ac6f5f7ef486a0be1a5c04666b03-2206x1298.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420952,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcX6ktp,1654607428,Why DESK? The Big Idea Behind CoinDesk’s Relaunched Social Token,"To understand why CoinDesk has launched a social token to reward our global audience for engaging with our content, it may help to take a walk down memory lane to a time before this website was founded.  A time before the first Bitcoin block was mined and before Satoshi Nakamoto published the white paper.  A time before the centralized platforms of Web 2 ruled all of our lives.  It’s amusing to look back on the early 2000s when the biggest worry for media organizations was new competition from “web logs” – soon shortened to blogs – and internet “citizen journalists.” It turned out instead that both groups – the legacy media and the digital upstarts – ended up in the same boat, tugged in all directions by the hulking vessels of the social media and search companies.  Read more \The Story of DESK: How CoinDesk Built Its Social Token  People who grew up buying papers at newsstands or having them delivered to their home or office could have been forgiven if they expected similar behavior online. Consumers, it was reasonable to assume, would go directly to the websites they liked and trusted, paid subscription or not, and see what was there that day.  But thanks to the ascendancy in the 2010s of Google, Twitter and Facebook, the digital equivalent of the “front page” for readers was no longer any media outlet’s homepage. It was now the social media app and search results.  At first blush, this model appeared to be a win for information consumers. Users could curate their social feeds, following the writers or outlets that interested them and ignoring the rest. Instead of buying three or four different papers or magazines, each bundling an article you want to read with others that you don’t, you have one customized mix-and-match bundle consisting only of what you want. (You might miss out on some things you didn’t realize you wanted, but that’s your choice.)  That might have been all well and good if it were the end of the story. The problem – for content creators and consumers alike – is the platforms, the enormous power they wield, and the arbitrary and opaque ways they do so.  The tyranny of search  Far from facilitating a direct relationship between journalists and their audience, social and search simply became the new gatekeepers.  The Google algorithm became the be-all arbiter of what web content would be found. Facebook’s “like” audience curation system created an echo chamber amplification system that ended up incentivizing disinformation (read the history of Cambridge Analytica). Twitter’s prominence as a forum for debate meant that it was pressured into censorship, with conservatives particularly angered by what they saw as selective de-platforming and content suppression.  All content creators – mainstream journalists, bloggers, pundits, podcasters and everyday people giving their two cents – have been thrust into an endless shouting match, vying to be heard over the din on social media. Press sensationalism long predated the internet, of course, but social and search algorithms have been like a gain-of-function lab experiment for the profession’s old ailments, making them more virulent and contagious.  Read more | DESK Is Back: CoinDesk Relaunches Social Token Into the Wild  Founded in 2013, CoinDesk grew up in this environment, and we’ve frequently experienced this centralized gatekeeping in negative ways.  From time to time, the word “cryptocurrency” has worked as a flag for Google’s algorithm, preventing our marketing team from advertising on that platform and, on two occasions, resulting in the unjustified shutdown of CoinDesk TV’s YouTube channel.  Especially galling at such times has been the lack of an explanation, the inability to reach someone to simply ask why these arbitrary measures are taken.  There’s got to be another way.  Enter DESK  You might think “why not just get a paywall?” Indeed, we may eventually launch a narrowly defined subscription service for certain, specialized users. But our overall goal remains to reach as broad a mass audience as possible, since we expect that crypto’s mainstream adoption will come from all quarters of society and all corners of the globe, and the best way to tap a mass audience is to offer free-to-air services.  We don’t just want occasional, fleeting visits from a reader in Istanbul or Nairobi or from someone who works in accounting or entertainment whose eye was caught by a particular headline. We want our audience to stick around, to explore other elements of what CoinDesk has to offer, to engage with the content in ways that are meaningful to them and to other readers.  Our goal, you could say, is “stickiness.”  This is where our DESK experiment comes in.  Read more |What Is DESK? FAQs about CoinDesk's Social Token  We’re hopeful, like many others, that crypto and Web 3 solutions involving tokens and new data and governance models will facilitate a more direct relationship with our audience and the expansion of a community of engaged participants that’s independent of the platforms.  Consensus 2022 kicks off Thursday in Austin, Texas. We believe this event, which moves the content creator-audience relationship out of the digital realm and into a physical space where internet gatekeepers have less influence, is a great place to experiment with new tokens and incentive models in pursuit of stickiness.  It bears repeating: DESK is not an investment. It has no financial value. We are not selling it to raise funds; we are not selling it at all. Users can earn DESK by participating in activities at Consensus and redeem it for rewards like refreshments and swag; trading it is prohibited by our terms of service, and pointless because DESK is useless outside our ecosystem.  We hope DESK generates a community that engages year-round in rich interaction with each other and with CoinDesk articles and other content and then comes back each year to gather in person at this cornerstone annual event.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MINING | TRADING,"Marc Hochstein, Michael J.

42415409,U2msve444uc2I0ChHDVbxY,1654607411,Binance.US Launches Crypto Staking Assault on Rivals Coinbase and Gemini,"Binance.US, the American arm of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has launched a blockchain staking product promising high yields on staked crypto, with the aim of outflanking similar offerings from rival U.S.-based exchanges.  The staking service – where users lock in assets to support proof-of-stake (PoS) networks – enables users to earn up to an 18% annual percentage yield (APY) on certain tokens, the company announced on Tuesday.  The PoS blockchains Binance.US supports include Audius (AUDIO), Avalanche (AVAX), BNB Chain, Cosmos (ATOM), Livepeer (LPT), Solana (SOL) and The Graph (GRT). More tokens will be added in the near future, Binance.US said.  Big exchanges simplify the staking of crypto tokens, for which they take a slice of the yield generated by the coins. Binance.US CEO Brian Shroder said the plan is to outdo staking APYs on the likes of Coinbase and Gemini.  Shroder said staking Cosmos blockchain’s ATOM token will generate a yield of 12.2% APY on Binance.US, while something like the smaller market cap Livepeer token could promise up to an 18% yield on LPT.  “We wanted to put out a product that would unquestionably be the best staking platform in the United States by the end of the year,” Shroder said in an interview. “So, for comparison purposes, we’re looking at the Coinbases, the Geminis, Krakens and BlockFis of this world, both in terms of more competitive returns and usability.”  M&A season?  All told, Binance.US appears to be in good health, notwithstanding signs of an approaching crypto winter; Shroder says the firm has “plenty of dry powder” to pursue acquisitions further down the line.  He also took the opportunity to point out that, in contrast to the dismal job news coming out of Coinbase and Gemini, his firm is hiring.  “We are hiring Coinbase and Gemini people onto our staff,” Shroder said. “There’s a lot of talent from those organizations that are applying to our open positions and we are actively interviewing them.”  Last week, Coinbase announced a hiring freeze and said it would rescind offers to applicants who had accepted jobs at the exchange.

The funding round was led by HBAR Foundation and Animoca Brands, with Polygon also participating.  The platform allows fans to connect with high-profile creators by purchasing video messages, online classes, video calls and fan club subscriptions.  The interface intentionally puts the crypto components of the platform out of sight, in a bid to attract mainstream users and celebrities who are not crypto natives.  Solo Ceesay, the company’s co-founder along with Dinwiddie, says he sees Calaxy as an emerging “Web 2.5” product, allowing mainstream users to interact with blockchain services without having to have an understanding of the underlying tech.  “If everyone had to be an engineer to drive a car, we’d have a lot less people driving cars,” Ceesay told CoinDesk in an interview. “We took social token technology, but then also took the utility that you find from already validated Web 2 social platforms focused on monetization.”  While the social token landscape is still relatively fresh, Calaxy will have to compete with the same Web 2 platforms it takes influence from, with both OnlyFans and Cameo launching Web 3 bids of their own to integrate non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  Calaxy had previously raised a $7.5 million funding round in June, with participation from NFL star Ezekiel Elliott and Matt James from “The Bachelor.”  Read more: Spencer Dinwiddie’s Crypto App for Creators Raises $7.5M",POSITIVE,HBAR,BLOCKCHAIN | MATIC | TECHNOLOGY | HBAR,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/07/nbas-spencer-dinwiddie-raises-26m-for-social-token-platform-calaxy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6332c5151116186868fa1520e4d58eb32a7dc83e-3350x2233.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415392,U2msve444uc2I0ChHDVbN5,1654606800,Katie Haun's New Fund Leads $32M Round in Lending Protocol Euler,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Euler XYZ has raised $32 million in a funding round that was led by Haun Ventures, the new firm started by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) alumna Katie Haun. The funding will go toward diversifying the treasury assets of the Euler DAO, which is expected to go live later this month.  Other backers in the round included Variant, FTX Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Jump Crypto, Jane Street and Uniswap Labs Ventures.  “Euler takes a unique approach to addressing the risks associated with lending and borrowing crypto assets that stood out to us as exemplary in DeFi,” Haun said in a press release. “These kinds of innovative solutions are particularly important since lending and borrowing protocols serve as a key cornerstone of crypto markets.”  How it works  In traditional finance, third parties like banks facilitate borrowing by connecting those with excess money to those needing short-term access to money. In DeFi, the banks and other parties are replaced by blockchain-backed lending platforms.  Leading lending platforms like Aave and Compound let users borrow and lend from among a chosen group of liquid tokens, while Euler users can add any asset that has a wETH pair on decentralized exchange Uniswap to the Euler lending market.  “The primary purpose of Euler when we first started the project was to remove a lot of the barriers to entry that projects have in terms of getting listed under a DeFi protocol,” Euler XYZ CEO Michael Bentley told CoinDesk in an interview. “We wanted to create a permissionless protocol, kind of like the Uniswap of lending and borrowing, where users can activate their own lending markets as they see fit.""  The permissionless setup means more tokens can be listed, but there is also a higher level of risk that one asset suddenly plunging in value could spill from one liquidity pool to another.  Euler XYZ offsets that risk by classifying assets into risk-based tiers. Euler generally allows users to borrow/lend in multiple assets at one time and to use multiple assets as collateral. The riskiest assets, however, are placed in isolation pools where users can borrow and lend but can’t use as collateral in transactions involving non-isolation assets.  “The key aspect here is risk isolation. How can you isolate risk for users in a way that doesn’t massively fragment capital?” Bentley explained.  Euler DAO  Euler is managed by holders of the native governance token Euler Governance Token (EUL). The upcoming launch of the Euler DAO will give holders the chance to vote on development and operations and determine how the community treasury is put to use.  “The near term for Euler is really focused on decentralization. As part of that, there will be lots of integrations coming down the line,” Bentley said.. “We’ve been talking to developers across the DeFi ecosystem that have been interested in integrating Euler into their workflows.”  Read more: Euler Finance Launches New DeFi Lending Platform in Crowded Market",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SPONSORED | UNI,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/07/katie-hauns-new-fund-leads-32m-round-in-lending-protocol-euler,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42415397,U2msve444uc2I0ChHDVbTW,1654603927,Morgan Stanley Sees Crypto Equivalent of Quantitative Tightening,"Weakness in crypto markets, the failure of a dollar stablecoin and a reduction in leverage in decentralized finance (DeFi) are resulting in the “crypto equivalent of quantitative tightening,” Morgan Stanley (MS) said in a report Tuesday.  The recent collapse of stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) saw Tether (USDT) also lose its dollar peg intraday, and this caused crypto prices to drop further as some questioned the stability of the third-largest cryptocurrency, bank said.  USDT has a market cap of $73 billion and is the most heavily traded digital asset on a daily basis, the report said. More than half of all bitcoins (BTC) traded on exchanges are traded against USDT.  Investors are redeeming USDT at a record pace, the bank said. Some $10.6 billion of redemptions occurred in the last month alone, while other stablecoin issuance is not rising.  Morgan Stanley called this the “crypto equivalent of quantitative tightening, as total stablecoin market cap falls, and liquidity on decentralized exchanges and leverage on lending platforms falls even faster.”  Of the $10 billion of USDT redeemed, $5.9 billion was on the TRON blockchain, with much less on Ethereum, the note said. At $21 billion, crypto exchange Binance is the largest known owner of USDT and controls 49% of the stablecoin issued on TRON, the note added.  According to the report, Binance, FTX and Bitfinex were the three largest redeemers of USDT. Curve, a DeFi exchange, hosts over a third of USDT on DeFi platforms, and here traders were swapping USDT for other stablecoins, it added.  “Systemic spillover” risks from the crypto markets to the fiat banking system appear limited, the bank said, because the leveraged crypto companies usually borrow from each other. However, if USDT falls materially under its $1 peg, this would have a larger negative impact on crypto and risk markets.

(Bermuda's Premier David Burt will speak at Consensus 2022 in Austin, Texas, this week.)  Jewel Bank will serve digital asset firms in non-sanctioned countries worldwide, including the U.S.  The bank plans to offer services in Bermuda and help accelerate the nation’s “digital transformation.”  Bermuda is known for its crypto-friendly regulations and compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures, according to Jewel’s leadership.  Jewel Settle, a real-time settlement network for payments, will allow select Jewel clients to settle with their digital asset trading counterparts in USD within minutes and at any time of day.  Jewel plans to issue a USD stablecoin and has plans for other single fiat currencies.  The bank also plans to issue stablecoins for other banks and non-bank financial institutions that don’t have the same regulatory, technology, and compliance capabilities.  Bermuda Premier David Burt told CoinDesk two years ago, during a podcast at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that he is spearheading projects to use the island as a testing ground for stablecoins and to launch a community-owned national digital bank.  CoinDesk podcast Money Reimagined: 'Bermuda Will Skip the Age of CBDCs' With Premier David Burt  “Institutional banking infrastructure has been the critical missing link for high growth digital asset exchanges and institutions outside of the U.S., bringing much-needed liquidity, reliability, and scale to this rapidly growing global space and its demand for fiat ramps and stablecoin payments,” said Chancellor Barnett, Jewel Bank's founder, chairman and chief strategy officer.

The Cronos Accelerator Program, funded by the $100 million Cronos Labs Ecosystem Fund, will provide investments of $100,000 to $300,000 in early-stage projects and additional grant funding for security audits, node services and gas fees. The program will also pair startups with mentors and provide weekly workshops on topics associated with protocol building. In addition, participating startups can explore investment opportunities with Cronos’ VC partners.  Cronos plans to select three or four cohorts per year, with 10 startups per cohort, to participate in the 10-week program, with the first being expected in July.  Participating projects can expect to raise between from $500,000 to $2 million in initial investments from Cronos labs and third-party investors, according to Cronos Managing Director Ken Timsit.  Timsit says the startup program aims to nurture projects that appeal to users of crypto spaces.  “We are looking for what we think Cronos users and, more broadly, the users of the crypto ecosystem, would be interested in, such as products that are easy to understand, easy to use and to unlock,” Timsit told CoinDesk.  Startup founders don’t have to come to the program with a fully fleshed-out project, Timsit said.  “Not all projects are fully formed, and it’s very unlikely that the project, in the end, is going to look like what the pitch deck looks like at the application stage,” Timsit told CoinDesk. “But what will make a difference is whether the founder and co-founders have a track record of figuring things out and delivering [products].”  The Cronos Accelerator has partnered with several companies that will support participating projects through investments, mentorship and workshops, including Mechanism Capital, Spartan Labs, IOSG Ventures, OK Blockchain Capital, AP Capital, Altcoin Buzz and Dorahacks.  Cronos has begun connecting with potential startups for the program by hosting hackathons, attending Web 3 industry events and talking about the program with their network.  Ella Qiang, vice president of Cronos, said speaking with startup founders at various industry events confirmed the company’s suspicions that many promising startups lacked the tools to execute their visions and achieve sustainable growth.  “We realized that while many [projects] have high potential, they may not have all the tools they need to stand out and build sustainable tokenomics,” said Qiang in a press release. “We want to provide the necessary support for early-stage projects and accelerate their growth on Cronos.”",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | SPONSORED | CRO,Elizabeth Napolitano,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/06/07/blockchain-network-cronos-launches-accelerator-program-to-support-defi-gamefi-startups,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e18498455f3f07e5a527bfa3741e0b00c0f6fd95-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A survey was conducted among 3,200 investors and another of more than 500 financial advisors at wealth management firms across China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand.

The 24-hour trading volume of Kadena is $21.62 Million, indicating a hike of 8.99%. Past Performance of KDA KDA prices plummeted in April, and early May as the selling pressure grew out of control resulting in a downslide of 80% from $7.6 to $1.60.

42415408,U2msve444uc2I0ChHDVbr7,1654597811,"Investors View Polkadot as an Alternative Layer 1, Coinbase Says","Despite the growing amount of Polkadot’s token DOT being locked up in recent months, its market capitalization as a percentage of ether’s (ETH) has been in constant decline since the start of November 2021, Coinbase said in a report dated June 2.  DOT benefits from inflationary pressures as more tokens are locked up or bonded with every parachain auction. Parachains are individual networks running in parallel to create a harmonized, interoperable ecosystem.  However, DOT's market cap as a percentage of ETH has dropped to 4%, the report said. This level is similar to when Polkadot’s first mainnet was launched in May 2020, the report added.  Classification is an important reason in explaining the fall in DOT’s total market cap relative to ether’s, as many investors have categorized Polkadot as an alternative layer 1 competing with ethereum, rather than as a layer 0, analysts led by David Duong wrote.  From this perspective, DOT’s value can be seen as proportional to the total value locked (TVL) within it “as opposed to the value of its unique modular structure and cross-chain capabilities,” Coinbase said.  The reason for this misperception is that for a considerable time, Polkadot lacked the “cross-consensus messaging capabilities that allow parachains to actually transfer data and tokens among themselves,” but this finally launched on May 4 this year, the note said.  Last month, the platform said it was bringing liquid staking to its network of blockchains, allowing holders of cryptocurrency who have pledged to support the proof-of-stake (PoS) network an additional way to increase their revenue by earning extra yield in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

For Fireblocks, the expansion into payments comes after the company acquired First Digital, a payments technology firm focused on making crypto and stablecoin usage compatible with merchants and cross-border use cases. The deal was part of a plan to assist Fireblocks in expanding support for business-to-consumer payments using USD coin (USDC), celo and other stablecoins and cryptocurrencies.  “Traditionally, merchant payouts are limited to 9-5 on weekdays excluding public holidays and are further delayed through batch processing over several business days,” said Ran Goldi, Fireblocks vice president of payments. “Checkout.com’s weekend settlement means that merchants are no longer restricted by arbitrary settlement times.”  The move also comes as various payment firms seek to bridge the gap between fiat and crypto payment options. Stripe said in April it will utilize Polygon in a move that will enable customers to pay sellers, freelancers, content creators and service providers in crypto.

42415394,U2msve444uc2I0ChHDVbRN,1654596000,Lightning Network Startup Mash Raises $6M Seed Round,"Mash, a payment platform that uses the Lightning Network to allow creators, builders and developers to make money from the content they publish online, has raised $6 million in seed funding.  Castle Island Ventures and Whitecap Venture Partners co-led the funding round. Other notable investors included Maple VC, Strategic Cyber Ventures, Aquanow, Spacecadet Ventures and several angel investors, including Amjad Masad, Balaji Srinivasan, Austin Hill, John Pfeffer and Dean Skurka, according to a press release.  Mash said it will use the funds to build out its payment platform, forge ties with digital experience creators and add staff to its engineering, marketing, sales and business development teams. The platform allows creators to offer low-commitment, “pay-as-you-enjoy” pricing options for online courses, games, interactive apps and other digital creations. It hopes to galvanize creators to spend more time developing high-quality content by increasing the revenue they make directly from consumers and reducing their reliance on ad revenue.  “Our goal is to enable all these awesome experiences to be built out, monetized appropriately and fairly so [developers and content creators] can go full time and build even more,” Mash CEO Jared Nusinoff told CoinDesk. “We want to enable a new era of the internet that's not based on attention and hijacking time, but [that’s] based, rather, on quality.”  Mash, which was founded in March 2021, released a free beta version of its product about a month or two ago, according to Nusinoff. And although he says it’s “too early” to pull out data or metrics on how the project is going, interest in the project has exceeded expectations so far.  Even though the product is still in its early stages, investors believe it has significant growth potential to connect consumers with developers, creators and builders from all over the world.  “With tens of millions of developers globally, and hundreds of thousands of new apps launching each year, the potential for Mash is significant,” Russell Samuels, a partner at Whitecap Venture Partners, said in the press release.  The Lightning Network  The product’s ability to engage creators and consumers worldwide is largely thanks to its use of bitcoin’s Lightning Network. The Lightning Network is ""layer 2"" software built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain that speeds up transaction processing times by enabling off-chain transactions.  By taking transactions off chain, transactions are nearly instantaneous, as well as virtually free. It's that fast, cheap feature that makes them good for microtransactions.  Although other platforms like Fountain and Alby are also using the Lightning Network to help creators monetize their work, Nusinoff believes his team’s product is unique. With Mash, payments are facilitated using a native digital wallet that doesn't need to be downloaded, are interoperable across the internet and can be loaded directly with a credit card or bitcoin.  Mash hopes to provide more freedom to consumers of digital content across the web by allowing them to engage with and pay for only the content they consume. That means consumers can steer clear of large upfront purchases and pricey subscription models.  “Say you're watching a documentary and the first 10 minutes are free,” Nusinoff told CoinDesk. “The whole thing costs three bucks, [but with Mash] you're only paying for the time that you’ve watched it. So, if you've watched the next 10 minutes of the two-hour documentary, you don't like it and you turn it off, you only paid 20 cents. There's no commitment.”  The company is also creating widget components for creators' sites and building a self-serve signup experience to streamline creators’ on-boarding processes.

The company, whose American depositary receipts are listed on Nasdaq, produced 124 bitcoins or bitcoin equivalents in May, compared with 166 the previous month.  The company started mining operations at its Helios facility in Dickens County, Texas, in May. While bringing the facility on line, the company ""faced some limited instances of unplanned downtime,"" it said in an announcement Tuesday.  In addition, high temperatures in the state caused increased energy demand and higher electricity prices, and so Argo voluntarily reduced its energy usage there by curtailing its mining operations.  Argo also attributed the decline to an increase in mining difficulty on the Bitcoin network.  ""The company's hashrate on Terra Pool produced substantially lower bitcoin than in previous months, primarily due to short-term probabilistic outcomes. The company continues to explore all options to optimize its hashrate across alternative pools,"" Argo added.

In a then-delated May interview, Terra&apos;s Do Kwon said that they were trying to get to $1B in BTC so that &apos;besides Satoshi, we will be the largest single holder of Bitcoin in the world.&apos; He also proclaimed, &apos;within the crypto industry, the failure of UST is equivalent to the failure of crypto itself.&apos; Related Reading | Terra Beats Tesla As Second-Largest Corporate Bitcoin Holder After $1.5B Purchase At one point, it appeared that BTC and UST destinies were inextricably linked, but the bitcoin network absorbed the collapse nearly unscathed. Let&apos;s look at ARK&apos;s numbers and try to figure out how it did it. Terra, The Largest L-1 Blockchain Failure Ever At this point, everybody knows what happened with Terra. Nobody knows how it happened, though. Was it a coordinated attack or did the natural market&apos;s forces trigger the death spiral event? We wouldn&apos;t know, but the fact of the matter is that the UST de-pegged from the dollar causing a bank run in the Anchor protocol, and the eventual demise of the algorithmic stablecoin and its twin, LUNA.

42415405,U2msve444uc2I0ChHDVboy,1654592400,Key US Senators Introduce Crypto Bill Outlining Sweeping Plan for Future Rules,"A wide-reaching, bipartisan crypto bill emerged Tuesday from U.S. Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who are seeking to extend a comprehensive set of regulations across digital assets in the U.S. and have given industry lobbyists something meaty to debate.  Their bill would liberate small-scale purchases of goods and services from the mire of tax implications by making transactions of less than $200 tax-free – potentially clearing a path for a cryptocurrency that acts more like a currency. And, as expected, the legislation would grant new powers and a commanding presence to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  The legislation attempts to tackle the biggest questions hanging over digital assets. It would set new federal law for stablecoins, taxes on small-scale payments and the jurisdictions of regulators – answering the uncertainties that have kept the fledgling financial sector from maturing.  The effort from Lummis and Gillibrand, however, is seen in Washington as a starting point for a dialogue that won’t lead anywhere significant before next year. It joins several previous bills that mostly sought to bite off narrow pieces of the cryptocurrency landscape, such as the recent push for stablecoin rules by Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.). It even borrows from some of that work.  Still, the bill would likely have to split into several pieces in 2023 as it winds through congressional committees in the next session. With Lummis on the Senate Banking Committee that oversees the Securities and Exchange Commission and Gillibrand holding a spot on the Agriculture Committee that oversees commodities and the CFTC, the lawmakers are well placed to help shepherd key portions of the legislation.  Their “Responsible Financial Innovation Act” creates regulatory clarity for agencies charged with supervising digital asset markets, provides a strong, tailored regulatory framework for stablecoins and integrates digital assets into our existing tax and banking laws,” Lummis said.  These are some of the main features of what Gillibrand described as a “landmark bill” that “will provide clarity to both industry and regulators, while also maintaining the flexibility to account for the ongoing evolution of the digital assets market”  It would define the terrain between crypto securities and commodities, allowing token issuers to know beforehand what they are launching based on the “purpose of the asset and the rights or powers it conveys the consumer.” The market envisioned in the bill is dominated by commodities, including most of the big names in crypto, such as bitcoin, ether and dozens of the other tokens with significant market share that would fall into a definition as “ancillary assets” overseen by the CFTC.  The lawmakers would give the CFTC authority over the spot markets in crypto commodities, as sought by agency chief Rostin Behnam. That would carve out a key new power for the federal watchdog that doesn’t now have much reach into cash markets.  It also gives “needed legal clarity” in how to handle customer holdings after the recent furor over customers’ tokens getting roped in with an exchange’s assets in the event the company goes bankrupt – a worry that erupted after crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) suggested it as a possibility in a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The Biden administration has signaled it wants better custody arrangements in any crypto bills moving through Congress.  The Lummis-Gillibrand proposal also adopts language from a bill last year that sought to clarify the meaning of a crypto broker, especially hoping to protect wallet providers, software developers and others from being snagged by certain tax reporting requirements.  The bill doesn’t automatically set up the self-regulatory organization that many in the industry have lobbied for, but it calls for a study from the SEC and CFTC and a proposal for starting one.  Crypto operations watched by the CFTC would – under this legislation – have to start paying fees to fund the agency, akin to the model that now supports the SEC.  The senators also suggest an industry “sandbox” in which regulators let crypto firms test new products on a limited scale and duration.  In light of the recent, dramatic collapse of terraUSD (UST), one closely examined aspect of the bill will be its move toward “100% reserve, asset type and detailed disclosure requirements for all payment stablecoin issuers.” There would be a new framework for banks and credit unions to issue stablecoins, but issuers wouldn’t have to become depository institutions. The lawmakers insist that “existing stablecoin issuers and new entrants into the market have an adequate opportunity to compete with existing banks and credit unions.”  The bill also requires certain disclosures to the SEC from companies that raise funds through digital asset sales. The approach would ensure “that market participants and our securities regulatory community receive detailed and accurate disclosures about those digital assets that are widely traded, but in a manner that encourages innovation,"" said Lewis Cohen, co-founder of DLx Law, a crypto lobbying firm.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/07/key-us-senators-introduce-bill-outlining-sweeping-plan-for-future-crypto-rules,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3ee5da20b1fc21e473fac5cc3f71ddb1ba79e3bd-4765x3177.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The round will value the New Jersey-based firm at $1 billion, according to the report, which cites sources with knowledge of the matter.  The funding, known as a ""down round,"" occurs when a company seeks to raise more capital and discovers that its valuation is lower than during a previous financing.  BlockFi raised $350 million at a larger valuation of $3 billion in March last year. It was reportedly set to raise a further $500 million, valuing it at nearly $5 billion, in late July and had also been making known its plans to go public.  The lower valuation points to the more challenging atmosphere in the crypto industry at present as well as regulatory uncertainty surrounding firms such as BlockFi, which offers high-interest payouts against crypto holdings.  In February, the firm agreed to pay a total of $100 million in penalties to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and several state regulators as part of a settlement in an investigation into whether its high-yield lending product was a securities offering.

According to a local Japanese newspaper, the country&apos;s Ministry of Justice is mulling a proposal to seize illegally acquired crypto assets to combat cybercrime. According to the research, the present law on organized crime penalties does not encompass the treatment of unlawfully acquired crypto assets. This might ultimately become a way for criminals to get around anti-money laundering/counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) regulations. However, the ministry is thought to be consulting the Legislative Council this month to draft a framework that would enable the seizure of crypto assets. Virtual assets will be treated similarly to real estate, movables, and monetary claims in exchange.

IOVLabs, with the help of Rootstock technology, will bring Everyday DeFi to a global audience. Onboarding the first billion users is the primary objective. The Promise of Everyday DeFi It sounds very appealing to see more decentralized finance opportunities for everyone. Despite the industry&apos;s popularity, it primarily caters to existing cryptocurrency users and holders, whereas the rest remains a bit left out. That is unfortunate, as over a billion people are still unbanked or underbanked today. A viable solution needs to be found between the two industry segments, although it has proven tricky so far. The IOVLabs team has a plan to change that narrative for the better. The team will leverage the Rootstock ecosystem and enhance it to bring Everyday DeFi to those who need it the most. Making DeFi accessible and usable is a big step forward. More details on this new initiative will be unveiled during the Consensus 2022 conference in Texas this month. IOVLabs CEO and RSK Co-Founder Diego Zaldivar adds: &apos;Current DeFi solutions are too complex for regular users. That&apos;s why it has only been used by an elite of advanced users.

42374447,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZVw7,1654567200,Indonesian Exchange Pintu Raises $113M to Meet Country's Crypto Boom,"Indonesian cryptocurrency exchange Pintu has raised $113 million in a Series B funding round with investments from venture capital firms Intudo Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Pantera Capital and investment advisory firm Northstar Group, according to a press release provided to CoinDesk. Lightspeed led Pintu’s $35 million Series A extension in August.  Pintu plans to use the capital to build out new features, including additional supported tokens and blockchains and products. The exchange doubled the size of its team to 200 last year and plans to continue with its aggressive hiring plans to help address the booming crypto market in Indonesia.  “The numbers of crypto investors in Indonesia have doubled from 6 million in the beginning of 2021 to over 12 million in February 2022 – which is about [twice] the number of public equity investors in the country,” Pintu Chief Marketing Officer Timothius Martin told CoinDesk in an email.  “Despite the rapid growth, however, the Indonesian market is still relatively new to crypto,"" he continued. ""This makes education about crypto investment a key pillar to support the growth of the market.""  Launched in April 2020, the beginner-friendly Pintu mobile app supports the purchase and sale of bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and 50 other cryptocurrencies. The app has a number of payment integrations to make it easier for users to deposit and withdraw funds. Features include Pintu Earn – offering up to 15% annual percentage yield (APY) – and Pintu Staking for staking of the native Pintu token.  The exchange also offers Pintu Academy, an educational platform that teaches beginning crypto traders how to invest while managing risks.  Pintu's total user base has more than doubled in the last six months, says Martin, from 2 million in December to almost 5 million in May.  Pintu is registered and licensed by the Bappebti regulatory agency and works closely with the government to abide by its legal framework.  “Crypto adoption is happening everywhere, and Indonesia has proven itself to be one of the world’s most rapidly growing markets for crypto assets,” Pantera partner Paul Veradittakit said in the press release. ”Crypto is a global asset class, and Pintu has become Indonesia’s premier portal to gain access to crypto and invest alongside global peers.”  Read more: Indonesia to Charge 0.1% Tax on Crypto Transactions, Investments",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SPONSORED,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/07/indonesian-exchange-pintu-raises-113m-to-meet-countrys-crypto-boom,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0aff1230f71208286f7c840e584dfcfcd5b18064-7360x4912.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394216,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvZhuh,1654564431,Even Giants Started Out Small: Cooperation and the Early Days of Bitcoin,"A new research paper to be released this week sheds some interesting light on Bitcoin’s first two years of existence, finding that the small group of early miners often played by the rules even when they had an opportunity to cheat.  The paper, “Cooperation among an anonymous group protected Bitcoin during failures of decentralization,” is interesting and valuable work, including the team’s rigorous work tracking early Bitcoin activity through a mining data stream dubbed the “extranonce.” But it is also highly technical and nuanced, and the topics it touches on, including Bitcoin security, privacy and distribution, are highly contentious. This makes it quite vulnerable to misinterpretation (or misrepresentation) by nonspecialists.  The paper finds that for long stretches between January 2009 and February 2011, one miner on the nascent Bitcoin network had the opportunity to conduct a “51% attack.” By virtue of controlling a majority of the network’s mining power (or hashrate), that miner would have been able to double-spend coins or even take bitcoin from other users. But despite these lengthy windows of opportunity, no early bitcoin miners attacked the chain. “Strikingly, we find that potential attackers always chose to cooperate instead,” the researchers write.  The researchers, a large team including members from Baylor College of Medicine and Rice University, have emphasized that the paper does not make claims about Bitcoin outside of that short, early window.  The discovery that early bitcoiners cooperated even when they had a chance to cheat may seem unremarkable on its face. Bitcoin in its earliest years was an experiment with little or no economic value, and the various actors almost certainly had more to gain by supporting the system than attacking it.  But the research is only in a limited sense even about Bitcoin as a technical system. Its primary goal, instead, is to “study responses to a social dilemma in a group of anonymous individuals.” In this case, the social dilemma was how to build a system vulnerable to attack in its early stages. The answer – which is also apparent if you’re familiar with the real-world story of Bitcoin’s early development and growth – was some mix of trust, common cause, and enlightened self-interest.  So early Bitcoin is a useful case study of human behavior under particular game-theoretical conditions, but a better understanding of the Bitcoin system was not the researchers’ primary goal. “The key to the paper is the behaviors that we characterize,” team member Dr. Erez Aiden, a genomics researcher at the Baylor College of Medicine, told CoinDesk in response to emailed questions.  This helps explain why, while the team is composed largely of mathematicians and computer scientists, many of them work on research problems in genomics, biology, and medicine. The research is ultimately concerned less with Bitcoin itself than with the behavior of the humans who created Bitcoin – including those who, given the opportunity to steal, chose not to do it.  This is also why the paper concludes with a psychological experiment using a game-theoretical model to mimic early bitcoiner behavior. Participants played a game called “Centipede,” which allows anonymous players to steal from one another in a way similar to a 51% attack. In experimental repetitions of an eight-player Centipede game, the researchers found that players displayed “high levels of cooperation,” even when the incentive to steal was high and they were anonymous to other players.  While not directly relevant to understanding Bitcoin’s security on a technical level, these findings are at least a bit reassuring on the subject of human nature.  Is Bitcoin less private than we thought?  Not for the vast majority of users – and the researchers make no such claim.  They do rigorously apply an already-known form of “data leakage” relevant to the study of on-chain Bitcoin activity. This form of metadata, known as the “extranonce,” is uniquely generated by individual miners. The method has been known since 2013, when it was described by Sergio Demian Lerner, who used it to track the early tokens mined by Satoshi. The method has fairly limited utility, and according to the researchers, even within the limited sphere of transaction graphing.  “If all we did was add in the extranonce, which is quite error prone, it would be completely impossible to reconstruct the early bitcoin community,” Aiden told CoinDesk. The paper uses many other transaction linking techniques, largely methods that are already in widespread use in chain analysis.  Read more: Bitcoin Isn’t Private – But Its Recent Taproot Upgrade Will Help  Moreover, it seems the extranonce would only provide additional transparency into the very earliest days of Bitcoin. That’s largely because it relies on metadata generated by miners specifically. Because the earliest bitcoiners relied on Bitcoin clients for both mining and wallet (key control) functions, and because mining on a home computer or gaming rig was economical for much of the study period, a wide variety of early users may have generated extranonce data.  But in the years since, mining has almost entirely migrated to specialized mining machines, known as ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), run at industrial scale by professional mining companies. Meanwhile, contemporary users are vastly more likely to buy bitcoin (BTC) on a marketplace than mine it themselves. The vast majority of individual Bitcoin users now use wallet-only software with no mining capacity, or will never mine on their own hardware. These users will never generate extranonce data.  The extranonce could be a threat to a handful of very early miners, particularly any who have worked to conceal their identity over the long term. But because this data source is already well known, it's unlikely any early miners who haven't previously been doxxed will be as a result of the new research. There may also be some implications for miners today, but the data seems primarily useful for transaction graph tracking within a limited time period and for a very small group of agents, and perhaps for some who transacted with them.  Just as important, the extranonce data does not add any qualitatively new way to connect transactions or wallets to real-world identities, and no previously unknown real-world identities are revealed in the paper itself. As the researchers detail, they are able to connect identities to wallets through public posts or other disclosures, usually instances where a user posted their own Bitcoin address publicly. Extranonce data may improve the ability to track connections to these doxxed entities, but it does not create a new way to identify the owners of Bitcoin addresses.  Aiden was quite direct about this in response to clarifying questions from CoinDesk. “All of the forms of data leakage we exploited were guided by our desire to understand that 25-month-long period” after Bitcoin’s launch, he said. “Now, obviously Bitcoin has been through extensive changes since 2011! So some forms of data leakage may work less well now, and some may work better. Extranonce is probably going to be less impactful today.”  The research was not intended to make sweeping claims about Bitcoin privacy. And it doesn’t.  Is Bitcoin less secure than we thought?  No – and the researchers make no such claim.  An early passage does seem ripe to be plucked out of context to misrepresent their stance, however. The researchers write that “wealth, income, and resources in the [early] Bitcoin community were highly centralized. This threatened Bitcoin’s security, which relies on decentralization, routinely enabling agents to perform a 51% attack.”  But the takeaway from this is absolutely not that Bitcoin as a system is insecure, because the researchers are explicitly and only talking about the two-year period of study, from January 2009-February 2011.  Instead, their more limited finding is that repeatedly, in the early days of Bitcoin, a single miner was generating more than 51% of network hash power for several blocks in a row. For instance, during the week from Sept. 29-Oct. 4, 2010, a miner described as Agent #2 had “enough resources to perform a 51% attack during several 6+ hour long windows.” This would have made it trivially easy for such a miner to to double-spend tokens, or even to reorganize the chain to give themselves all the bitcoin then existing.  But they didn’t. Agent #2 continued to process transactions normally, even at a moment when they could have done pretty much whatever they wanted. That behavior by individuals is the point of the research, rather than any technical or structural claim about Bitcoin itself.  This claim is itself both fairly abstract and fairly obvious, simply because the risk-reward calculus of performing a 51% attack between 2009-2011 was vastly different than it would be today. For much of the period under study, bitcoin literally had no economic value: “Bitcoin Pizza Day,” the first known monetary transaction using bitcoin, took place in May 2010, two-thirds of the way through the study period. Mt. Gox, the first widely used bitcoin exchange, launched in July 2010, more than three-quarters of the way through the study period.  That means that for most of the study period, even when miners had long strings of uncontested blocks, they had absolutely nothing to gain from a 51% attack. (Agent #2’s altruistic mining is particularly notable because it took place after these economic milestones.)  Miners also had a lot to lose by attacking. First, that’s because the early Bitcoin community was so tight-knit. Many of the players knew each other personally, if only via email and message boards. Attacking the chain in its vulnerable early days might have made a miner a pariah. Furthermore, such an attack was unlikely to actually earn an attacker that much money: Even after bitcoin gained economic value, news of a 51% attack could have led to people seeing bitcoin as a failed experiment, destroying that value.  These days, a brute force 51% on Bitcoin is economically prohibitive and would probably be socially rejected to boot. (That is, other miners and users would migrate to a chain rolled back to a pre-attack state, leaving an attacker holding tokens on a far less valuable fork.) While there may be some sort of alliance or more complex tactics that could lead to a successful 51% attack, they would require Herculean effort. The situation the paper describes, in which there simply aren’t that many competing miners, is unlikely to recur any time soon.  Using this evidence to question Bitcoin’s decentralized security model is simply a non-sequitur – a complete misreading of the research.  Is Bitcoin more unequal than we thought?  No – and in fact, the researchers find overwhelming evidence that it rapidly became more economically egalitarian rapidly after its launch.  The researchers do use some terms that could lead superficial readers astray. In particular, the researchers write that “in line with the findings of Vilifredo Pareto …. wealth, income, and resources in the [early] Bitcoin community were highly centralized.”  Pareto is often cited in social science research on income and wealth inequality in society. Broadly, his “Pareto Principle” is often used to analyze or diagnose the tendency in some societies for wealth to become increasingly concentrated in a society over time because of an inequality of returns for effort. (It’s also sometimes known as the 80/20 rule.)  The citation seems at first glance to implicate Bitcoin in this dynamic. (Notably, even on its own terms such a finding would not be a critique of Bitcoin alone, but also of the broader society it exists within.) But the researchers are not claiming, as some may assert, that Bitcoin as a whole tends toward wealth concentration in a way that, in turn, threatens network security.  Instead, the paper’s actual on-chain data about mining and token distribution shows quite the opposite. In a footnote, the researchers make this explicit: “During the final two intervals [January 2010 – February 2011], [miner] income inequality declines greatly, falling in line with the levels seen in typical economies.”  On a related note, the researchers found that “almost all contemporary bitcoin addresses can be connected to … top [early] agents by a chain of six transactions.” This finding could easily be misrepresented to argue that Bitcoin remains highly centralized today, or that those early miners have undue power in the system.  But the significance of the finding is unclear because real-world human beings even across a large geographic area are often separated from one another by six relationship links or fewer. This hypothesis was first developed by Stanley Milgram in the 1960s and was elaborated and significantly validated by researchers in the early 2000s. It is difficult, in this light, to see anything notable, much less scandalous, in the claim that most Bitcoin addresses are linked by six transactions to early miners. Though it is useful data to have, it’s more a matter of universal principles of probability and human behavior than the discovery of some secretive Bitcoin Mafia.  Similarly, the above chart of mining output during Bitcoin’s first two years may appear to highlight concentration of mining among a small set of actors – including Satoshi themselves. But its presentation may obscure what it actually shows: the speed with which this concentration ended.  Though it’s easy to miss, the chart is actually a timeline moving clockwise starting from Satoshi’s big red block of coins mined between January and July of 2009. Once you get to the upper left quadrant, representing the period from August 2010 to February 2011, the multitude of rainbow-colored dots around those last few big miners represents the rising decentralization of bitcoin mining and earning over time, a trend which has more or less continued since.  Conclusion: A decentralized strawman  In the current environment, Bitcoin and blockchain technology are frequently demonized by powerful voices who either don’t comprehend its promise – or comprehend it all too well and want to stop it. While the new research is compelling on its own terms, it unfortunately seems likely that it will be misrepresented by voices that want to leverage it for their own ends. Intentionally or not, the paper does occasionally give more rhetorical fuel to such misrepresentations than its actual findings merit.  The researchers have also gone to at least some effort to exploit Bitcoin’s centrality to their research to get more attention for it, as shown by coverage in the New York Times ahead of the paper’s publication. This is fine as far as it goes – more academics could benefit from a bit of marketing savvy, and again, this appears to be interesting stuff.  Unfortunately, we can predict with some confidence that this broader visibility will create more opportunities for it to be misinterpreted by those who approach it with an agenda, rather than on its own terms. While early bitcoiners were willing to cooperate to build something world-changing, not everyone is so generous.

42421554,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXocfN,1654564260,The Decentralized Mystique,"Today a team of data scientists release, and the New York Times reports on, what may be the most important piece of academic research yet on Web 3.  We expect headlines to focus on the more explosive potential implications of linking together many pseudonymous Bitcoin addresses. Yet, the real import of the paper cuts deeper and reveals more: We read it as showing that decentralization was more an ideology than a property of the Bitcoin technology in its early years.  Jaron Lanier is a technologist, artist and composer and is widely considered the father of virtual reality. He will appear at Consensus 2022 this week. E. Glen Weyl is a founder of the RadicalxChange Foundation and co-author of Radical Markets and “Decentralized Society.” While both work for Microsoft, neither speaks for the company.  The paper combines a variety of clever address-linking techniques similar to those offered commercially by firms like Chainalysis and Crystal Blockchain, together with approaches focused on identifying miners, to link more than 99% of Bitcoin addresses from the network’s inception in 2009 through 2011 back to unique individuals (and in some cases their legal names). While the study does not focus on identifying such names (except in two cases where they were already known), it shows enough about methods used that we suspect these will eventually be used to bring significantly greater transparency to the previously obscure founding figures in the community.  More deeply, they reveal several important properties of the early Bitcoin network, such as the finding that 64 agents (fewer than a thousandth of previous estimates based on counting addresses) mined a majority of BTC in this early period and that 51% of attacks could typically have been conducted by small groups of individuals (usually around five), including a single individual for significant periods. (In such attacks, a miner or group of miners obtains control of a majority of the network’s computing power and uses it to reorder, reverse or block transactions on the public ledger, usually to defraud other participants.)  Furthermore, in contrast to the self-image of Bitcoin as a global, open protocol, usage appears to have flowed through social networks connected to these initial pioneers in a manner like other nascent networks, from the early internet to Facebook.  Following the money  The immediate implications for the ecosystem should be obvious. The researchers find that nearly all transactions through the end of 2017 can be traced to Bitcoin addresses associated with this initial group of 64 agents by a small number of hops (four to six). It is well-known that identified seeds can usually be traced over such short chains, and so we expect the researchers’ findings to quickly undermine much of the pseudonymity of Bitcoin if their methods are replicated and widely applied.  Furthermore, it seems unlikely that the researchers are the first to achieve this conclusion about the small number of early miners; it is plausible that organizations like the National Security Agency, China’s Ministry of State Security and Israel’s Unit 8200 have long had access to this information and chosen not to reveal this capability to preserve the mystique of pseudonymity and the assumed-private financial records it gives them access to.  The new findings have the potential not only to undermine the (limited) remaining privacy reputation in the Bitcoin network but more broadly, to have reputational spillovers to many cryptographic protocols used in Web 3.  Yet, the paper’s most important implications are more profound, if less sensational.  Web 3 and the academy  First and perhaps most importantly, it is one of the first papers emerging from the mainstream of academic research to directly speak to issues at the core of Web 3.  While protocols like Algorand, Avalanche and Stellar and techniques like quadratic voting have emerged from academic work, the relationship between academia and Web 3 has been much more distant than in other fields of technology, such as the original internet and artificial intelligence, where the academy was central to the development. We hope that this paper will help usher in a new era of serious academic work on and engagement with Web 3, which we believe is critical to achieving the promises and avoiding the perils of the space, in ways partially highlighted by the paper.  It is disappointing how long it took for the paper to be published; the primary findings of the piece were shown to us more than two years ago, and the academic review process slowed their reaching the public. In such a fast-moving space, academia must learn to keep up or become irrelevant in a way that is dangerous in that it allows technology to run far ahead of scientific understanding. We figured that out with COVID-19 and must port the lesson to rapidly emerging technologies that pose just as great, even if less obvious, threats.  Technology is not enough  Second, we take from the paper that many, spurred by overblown rhetoric in the space, have dramatically overestimated the power of technical solutions on their own to ensure the security and privacy of sociotechnical systems. While cryptography and consensus mechanisms have an important role in complementing other protections, they are usually quite fragile on their own, untethered from laws, social norms, institutional reputations, etc.  In this instance, Bitcoin seems to have, in sharp contrast to its common reputation, become something of a perfect tool of state surveillance, revealing activities that many users believed to be protected by pseudonymity to sophisticated state security agencies while hiding transactions from communities of peers such as other developers, friends or community credit unions that would have been better placed to monitor them in context.  More broadly, we are generally suspicious of approaches that attempt to remove the need for intermediate institutions and forms of organization by relying on global protocols: “Global states” are usually entry points for nation-states.  Bitcoin’s mythical decentralization  Third, the paper undermines not only the mystique of pseudonymity around Bitcoin but also the mystique of (technical) decentralization. It was not technical decentralization that sustained Bitcoin, but rather the decision of a small number of people, who seem to have known each other (through cryptography conferences and online forums) and their roles, not to attack the system.  What motivated this “altruistic” behavior? We believe that two interrelated causes are likely: the potential of financial gain in the future if the system was seen as never failing and a vision of technical decentralization that the early leaders wanted to see tried at scale.  We thus believe decentralization functioned not as a technical property of the system but as an ideological inspiration and foundation of power. Such (often false) myths have long been the foundation of a range of social movements.  Many dispute the historical existence of a man named Moses or his capacity to part seas, but few doubt the power of his story to ensure the survival of the Jewish people through thousands of years of tribulation. Yet, what is supremely ironic is that as a myth, “decentralization” aimed precisely to avoid traditional institutional ties and to provide, instead, guarantees; as we see it, the myth of decentralization instead provided a perfect foundation to replicate what it meant to supplant.  The way forward  Finally, the paper points the way to what may be necessary to make decentralization work in technical design and practical application rather than mythic imagination. Bitcoin, like other technological platforms, exhibits network effects. Network effects spread through … networks. They are not the global open systems they purport to be. Thus, if they are engineered to privilege early adopters they will replicate the vast, arbitrary and oppressive inequalities of other technological systems that gave outsized power to early participants.  Other approaches to decentralization, such as the original internet, “webs of trust” and recent manifestations such as the Spritely Project, have attended to and directly tried to offset the power concentrations that come with network-based spread of uses. Meaningful decentralization requires awareness of and deliberate countering of “network power,” not an assumption that simplistic “openness” will achieve it.  Decentralization has long been the central dream of the internet. It was at the core of the pitch that computer scientist and psychologist J.C.R. Licklider made to the leaders of the Department of Defense’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) to avoid disruption from Soviet nuclear attack when he founded the ARPANET, which evolved into the internet.  At various, often fleeting, moments decentralization has been achieved by concerted and often centralized efforts to invest in it. But lasting decentralization won’t spring from brilliant lone hackers and financial speculation; it will come from broad public interest, awareness and a range of legitimate institutions working to make it happen, even at the expense of some of their power, to avoid outcomes (such as cyberattacks parallel to the Soviet nuclear attacks of yesteryear) they fear.  Our fondest hope is that the hype around Web 3 can combine with academic work like this paper and public concern about the concentration of power in technology and authoritarian governments to make decentralization a more stable reality.

Bitcoin’s formative years thus offer an interesting window into cooperation between anonymous parties. “Anonymity can interfere with the cooperative mechanisms of reciprocity, relatedness and reputation and is thus believed to reduce cooperation in general,” the paper notes. Yet counterintuitively, the data shows that even though 64 parties controlled most of the computing power during this era, they all acted in the best interest of the network. Even when they didn’t know each other.  To be clear: The study makes no concrete claims about the security of the Bitcoin network today, more than a decade after the end of the period analyzed.  “We sought to understand the socioeconomic process by which bitcoin transitioned from a digital object with no market, to a functional medium of exchange,” researcher Erez Lieberman Aiden told CoinDesk. “We therefore chose to study the period between launch and price parity with the U.S. dollar: the 25 months after Bitcoin's launch.”  Aiden noted that the forms of data leakage that the research is focused on were selected because of their usefulness in studying that defined 25-month time frame.  “In the end, we found that there was a lot of data leakage that we could exploit, which made our study possible,” he said. “Now, obviously Bitcoin has been through extensive changes since 2011! So some forms of data leakage may work less well now, and some may work better.”  On the other hand, he also noted that the project “was able to succeed because of a high degree of metadata leakage from the blockchain during the period we studied. There's no particular reason to believe that the data leakage is limited to the period of time we studied.”  Nevertheless, the paper, which the New York Times has covered, is likely to provoke heated discussions about longstanding challenges to Bitcoin network users’ privacy, given the novel combination of address-linking techniques the researchers employed – and, more broadly, about the motivations that enable decentralized networks to function.  Group of 64 bitcoin miners  According to the study, 64 separate actors mined a significant proportion of the BTC created from Jan. 3, 2009, the day the currency launched, to Feb. 9, 2011, the day its price climbed to $1.  This era long predated the advent of specialized mining machines, known as ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits). Early adopters mined BTC with the central processing units found in standard home computers, and later on with the more powerful graphics processing units favored by gamers.  The idiosyncrasies of these early mining computers helped the researchers identify pseudonymous Bitcoin addresses that were all controlled by the same actors, the paper says.  To successfully mine BTC, a computer must randomly generate a string of numbers called a nonce that, when fed into a mathematical formula along with a few other inputs, produces an output below a certain target. Just as individual humans have distinctive handwriting patterns (even if they write gibberish), early miners’ computers left “fingerprints” on the nonces they generated, according to the paper.  “There are extensive correlations between all of the apparently meaningless strings associated with a single user,” it says. These “extranonces” combined with other established blockchain forensic techniques allowed the researchers to zero in on the miners that mined many of the first 25 months’ worth of BTC and generated those early transaction addresses. This method was first described by Sergio Demian Lerner in 2013.  The team combined those correlations with a couple established address-linking techniques to arrive at the group of 64.  Altruistic bitcoiners  The fewer miners there are, the greater the chances for one to dominate the network or for more than one to collude to do so. The small number of miners during Bitcoin’s formative years means the network was “routinely” vulnerable to so-called 51% attacks, where someone controlling a simple majority of computing power can spend the same BTC twice, the study says.  Read more: Protection Over Profit: What Early Mining Patterns Suggest About Bitcoin’s Inventor  For example, three of the 64 “top agents” each mined six or more blocks in a row. In the most extreme example, in October 2010, there were five six-hour periods during which one miner, among the first to use a GPU, could have carried out a 51% attack, the study says.  Emphasis: Could have.  “Strikingly, we find that potential attackers always chose to cooperate instead,” the researchers wrote.  On one hand, their takeaway clashes with the stereotype (and perhaps, in some cases, self-image) of Bitcoin users, particularly early adopters, as cold-blooded individualists: “Rather than relying exclusively on a decentralized, trustless network of anonymous actors, Bitcoin depended on altruistic behavior by a group of anonymous agents,” the paper states.  On the other hand, that observation builds on previous research by Sergio Demian Lerner, head of innovation at IOVLabs, a blockchain technology company, and a designer at RSK Labs, a smart-contract development firm. Lerner has studied the so-called “Patoshi stash” of 1.1 million BTC believed to have been mined by Satoshi Nakamoto. Lerner suggested in a study released in 2020 that early miners (specifically, “Patoshi”) took measures to foster healthy mining competition while also ensuring that there were enough miners online to secure the network and produce blocks in a timely fashion.  This most recent study also describes game-theory experiments whose results support the notion that anonymous actors will cooperate for the good of the group rather than betray each other for a fast buck. Of course, in the context of a cryptocurrency, “the good of the group” can be defined as continued price gains, and the paper poses an unsettling question in what appears to now be a bear market: “Can participants be relied upon to cooperate if a cryptocurrency stops appreciating?”  Bitcoin privacy implications  The paper also claims that as of December 2017, 99% of Bitcoin network addresses were at most six transaction hops away from one of those 64 early miners. (If Bob sends 1 BTC to Alice, that’s one hop; if Alice sends the coin to Ted, that’s two hops between him and Bob, and so on.)  Although the researchers don’t claim to have identified the real names behind any of the 64 miners (except two who were already known), they warn that if someone did, many other users’ privacy might be compromised.  “Our results imply that, were the identities of the 64 top agents to become known, it would become easy to identify short transaction paths linking any target address to an already de-identified top agent address,” the study says.  Read more: Bitcoin Isn’t Private – But Its Recent Taproot Upgrade Will Help  The shorter the path between two addresses, the easier it is for someone who knows one user’s identity to figure out the other’s, the authors note. In the example above, if the FBI knows Ted is a drug lord, it can subpoena Alice’s transaction history from the crypto exchange she used to send him the BTC. From there, the feds might just have to google the address that sent her the coins to find it prominently displayed in the tip jar on Bob’s blog.  If nothing else, the researchers’ address-linking exercise underscores a well-known risk of using public, immutable ledgers like the Bitcoin blockchain. “The sources of information leakage, even once discovered, cannot be retroactively patched,” the paper says.  “The fact that we could find leaks in the period we studied suggests that there might be leaks elsewhere, too,” Aiden added.  America-based Satoshi?  The researchers avoid wading into the minefield of trying to unmask Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s creator, whose identity has been a hotly debated mystery since he (or she or they) published the original white paper in 2008.  However, they reiterate a previously examined data point that may offer a clue. Or not.  Read more: Previously Unpublished Emails of Satoshi Nakamoto Present a New Puzzle  Satoshi’s emails, forum posts and code updates were usually sent during Western hemisphere daytime hours, and his (or her or their) mining computer was generally inactive at nighttime in that part of the world.  “These data are in line with the possibility that Satoshi Nakamoto was living in either North or South America,” the academics write.  They don’t rule out another possibility: that like many coders, Satoshi was a night owl.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and other major cryptos take a late dive.  Insights: Hong Kong is hardly laissez-faire when it comes to crypto.

Bitcoin was recently trading at about $29,500, down 5% over the past 24 hours. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands at roughly $1,730, down about 6% over the same period. Other major altcoins that had risen significantly earlier in the day, including SOL and ADA, were more in the red as investors wrestled with the months-long flow of more troubling news.  Still, a number of analysts said that bitcoin was unlikely to take any deeper drops for the time being.  ""I think we may be putting in a bottom here with bitcoin,"" Greg King, CEO and founder of crypto asset manager Osprey Funds, told CoinDesk's ""First Mover"" program.  King noted that the presence of institutional investors has differentiated the latest price slump from previous crypto winters in 2013 and 2018, when bitcoin lost over 80% of its value. Bitcoin has currently dropped about 60% since hitting its all-time peak just short of $70,000 in November.  ""Institutional buyers are buying this dip and then don't forget the macro environment,"" King said, noting the four-decade high inflation rate in the U.S. ""Zero yield assets such as gold and Bitcoin do very well"" at these times, he added.  Stocks rose slightly on Monday with the tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500 increasing about a half percentage point, as was the case for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Gold, a traditional safe-haven asset, fell about a half-percentage point. Investors were buoyed by last week's job report that suggested the economy might not plunge into recession any time soon. Some analysts also believe that inflation has peaked, although markets will be nervously eyeing this Friday's consumer price index report, which is expected to show inflation remaining stubbornly above 8%, a four-decade high.  Volatility continued to fade in crypto markets, while the fear and greed index ticked higher, although it is still registering squarely in extreme fear territory. Bitcoin has been trading in a tight range between $28,000 and $31,500 for the past month as investors wait for clearer signals about whether the economy will sink into recession or power through its current headwinds.  King believes the increasing correlation between cryptos and stocks will reverse to some degree, calling it a ""reflection of this kind of wild situation in macro markets where we have awful conditions and so it's more of a risk-on, risk-off type of mindset.""  ""I personally think that crypto will emerge as – certainly things like bitcoin – as a relative safe haven as we continue to chop through an uncertain macro environment and especially if rates continue to rise and equities continue to tank, but I don't think that a long term correlation makes a lot of sense,"" he said.  Insights  Hong Kong Is Hardly Laissez-Faire When It Comes to Crypto  Hong Kong’s political freedom has eroded thanks to Beijing, though its laissez-faire economics – which have won accolades from the likes of Cato and the Heritage Foundation as the ""world’s freest economy"" – are still in its DNA.  For crypto, this isn’t the case. There are rules aplenty.  The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission’s (SFC) issued a memo this week reminding investors about the inherent risks of non-fungible tokens (NFT).  “As with other virtual assets, NFTs are exposed to heightened risks, including illiquid secondary markets, volatility, opaque pricing, hacking and fraud. Investors should be mindful of these risks, and if they cannot fully understand them and bear the potential losses, they should not invest in NFTs,” the SFC wrote.  All of which is true.  But the problem is this looks like the beginning of a regulatory push into the NFT market by the SFC, which currently says that most NFTs fall outside its regulatory remit. And when the SFC regulates crypto, it takes a heavy hand. This severity is ironic considering the accolades that Hong Kong has received by the likes of Koch Foundation-funded Cato, which advocates for less economic regulation.  Consider the SFC’s prohibition on non-accredited investors trading crypto at exchanges. If this were the case in the United States, Coinbase (COIN) wouldn’t have a business model; its total market would be limited to the 13.6 million accredited investors in the country. For all the criticism the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has gotten about harming domestic innovation because of restrictive rules on crypto, banning non-accredited investors from trading crypto is something even SEC head Gary Gensler wouldn’t do.  Then there are Hong Kong’s murky rules on crypto infrastructure. Stakeholders have previously complained that the rules spread across too many different agencies for things like custody. Some critics have even called it a “double standard.” The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, its central bank, only recently greenlit crypto companies to open bank accounts – provided they only interact with accredited investors.  All this was too much for Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX. The crypto exchange that once called Hong Kong home decamped for the Bahamas in September, citing Hong Kong’s hostility towards crypto and never-ending quarantine regime.  For the world’s freest economy, there sure are a lot of heavy-handed rules regarding the future of finance. NFTs are likely to be next.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Bounces Above $27K-$30K Support Zone; Resistance at $33K-$35K  Bitcoin (BTC) experienced another relief bounce over the past 24 hours, similar to what occurred last weekend. The cryptocurrency is holding support above $27,000 and $30,000, which could keep short-term buyers active.  BTC is up by 4% over the past 24 hours and is down by 1% over the past week. That suggests the current price range remains intact, which is typical after several weeks of negative returns.  The recent downtrend in price has stabilized above the May 12 low at $25,338, which contributed to rising momentum on the daily chart. For example, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) returned above the 50 neutral mark Monday after reaching extreme oversold levels on May 9.  Still, momentum remains negative on the weekly and monthly charts, which means an upswing in BTC could be limited. The next resistance zone is between $33,000 and $35,000.
