Year to date, the largest cryptocurrency is up over 125%, but all of the year’s gains have been confined to a handful of trading days in January, March, June, and now. The fact that Bitcoin is at 52-week highs today is ironic given the fact that its all-time high of just below $69K was exactly two years ago today. Even for a volatile asset class, it has been quite a week for crypto-related assets. With a gain of nearly 8% for the week, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) rallied to 52-week highs and crossed above 35K, 36K, and 37K in the process. Year to date, the largest cryptocurrency is up over 125%, but looking at the chart below, all of the year’s gains have been confined to a handful of trading days in January, March, June, and now. Ethereum had an even bigger week, rallying by over 14.5% and nearly doubling the gain in Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum was trading just shy of its YTD high from back in April. The fact that Bitcoin is at 52-week highs today is ironic given the fact that its all-time high of just below $69K was exactly two years ago today. Given where prices are now, it doesn’t seem likely that those highs will be tested again any time soon, although stranger things have happened. The chart below shows Bitcoin’s drawdowns from all-time highs over time. Perhaps the most notable aspect of Bitcoin’s rally is the fact that even after rallying more than 100% this year, the current drawdown of 45% is deeper than the average drawdown of 40.4% for all days since 2016. Just to get back to that historical ‘average’ drawdown, Bitcoin would need to rally back above $40K.

20029179,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559365,1699657205,When Is the Next BTC Halving Date? Bitcoin Halving Guide,"Guide: What Is The Bitcoin (BTC) Halving? The anticipation around the next BTC halving is palpable among investors and cryptocurrency enthusiasts alike. This process, which slashes the reward for mining Bitcoin transactions in half, is a pivotal event for the economy of the flagship cryptocurrency. The next BTC halving date is not just a mark on the calendar; it’s a beacon for potential shifts in value and market dynamics, making the question “when is the next BTC halving” all the more critical for market participants. This comprehensive guide dives deep into the concept of Bitcoin halving, its historical impact, and what the future holds as we approach the next halving. Bitcoin Network 101: The Basics Explained The next BTC halving is a seminal event in the Bitcoin blockchain’s timeline, marking the point at which the reward for mining new blocks is halved. This event is not just a technical adjustment, but a significant milestone that historically has had profound implications for Bitcoin’s economics and market sentiment. Since the 2020 halving, miners have been receiving 6.25 Bitcoins (BTC) per successfully mined block, a reward that incentivizes the decentralized security of the network. Looking ahead, the next BTC halving is projected to take place in early-to-mid 2024, a moment when the mining incentive will decrease to 3.125 BTC per block. This editorial delves into the intricacies of the next BTC halving, examining its anticipated date, the countdown to the event, and the broader implications for Bitcoin’s supply and valuation. We will also explore the historical context of past halvings to understand the potential future trajectory of Bitcoin as the reward continues to halve towards the smallest unit of a Bitcoin, one Satoshi. The Bitcoin network is a triumph of cryptographic achievements and economic incentives that create a trustless system for value transfer. At its core, the network is a distributed database, known as the blockchain, that maintains a continuously growing list of transaction records hardened against tampering and revision. It employs a consensus algorithm called Proof of Work (PoW) to ensure network synchrony and security. Bitcoin Mining 101 Miners, who are network participants with specialized hardware, compete to solve cryptographically hard puzzles. The solution to these puzzles requires a significant amount of computational power and energy. The first miner to validate a block of transactions by solving the puzzle is granted the right to append that block to the blockchain. This process is referred to as ‘mining’ a block, and it is through this mechanism that transactions are confirmed and the network is secured. The reward for mining is twofold: miners collect transaction fees from each transaction included in the new block, and they are also awarded a block subsidy. This subsidy is composed of newly created bitcoins and is the mechanism through which new bitcoins are introduced into circulation. The block subsidy is predetermined by the Bitcoin protocol and undergoes a halving event every 210,000 blocks, which historically occurs approximately every four years. The Bitcoin protocol is designed to be a self-regulating market system. The difficulty of the cryptographic puzzles adjusts approximately every two weeks (“Bitcoin Difficulty Adjustment”), ensuring that the time between each block found remains close to ten minutes, despite the fluctuating amount of computational power dedicated to mining. This difficulty adjustment is critical to the network’s stability and the predictability of Bitcoin issuance. Definition And Rationale Behind BTC Halving The BTC halving is an event that is deeply embedded in the Bitcoin protocol, serving as a deflationary mechanism by design. It is a deliberate algorithmic adjustment that occurs every 210,000 blocks, which historically equates to roughly every four years. During this event, the block subsidy awarded to miners for each block mined—comprising new bitcoins created and added to the circulating supply—is cut in half. This halving process is a critical component of Bitcoin’s economic model, which is characterized by a capped supply limit of 21 million coins. The halving serves to enforce a synthetic form of inflation that is programmatically decreasing over time, ensuring that the issuance of new bitcoins follows a predictable deceleration curve akin to the extraction of a finite resource. Key Narrative Behind The Bitcoin Halving The rationale behind this process is multifaceted: Controlled Supply Emission: By algorithmically enforcing a reduction in the rate at which new bitcoins are created, the halving event ensures that the total supply approaches the maximum cap asymptotically, a stark contrast to fiat currencies which can be printed without limit. Inflation Hedge: The halving events contribute to Bitcoin’s proposition as a hedge against inflation. As the rate of supply expansion slows down, assuming demand remains constant or increases, the purchasing power of Bitcoin should, in theory, strengthen over time. Security Incentives: The block subsidy is a critical incentive for miners to expend energy securing the network. As the subsidy decreases, the expectation is that a corresponding increase in the value of Bitcoin will offset the reduced block reward, maintaining or enhancing the security budget. Market Anticipation and Speculation: Halving events are often accompanied by significant market attention and speculation, leading to increased trading activity and liquidity as investors attempt to predict and capitalize on potential price movements resulting from the supply shock. Long-Term Viability: By enforcing a methodical reduction in new supply, Bitcoin’s halving events are designed to ensure the network’s long-term viability, preventing the rapid depletion of mining rewards and encouraging sustainable growth. Brief History Of Past BTC Halving Dates And Their Impact The history of Bitcoin halving dates back to November 28, 2012, when the first halving occurred at block 210,000. Prior to this event, the block reward was 50 BTC. Post-halving, it was reduced to 25 BTC. The impact was significant, with the price of Bitcoin increasing from approximately $12 in November 2012 to over $1,100 in November 2013, marking an increase of over 9,000%. This price surge is attributed to the reduced supply of new bitcoins and increased media and investor attention. The Second and Third BTC Halving The second BTC halving took place on July 9, 2016, at block 420,000, further reducing the block reward to 12.5 BTC. The price at the time of the halving was around $650, and over the next 18 months, Bitcoin experienced unprecedented growth, reaching an all-time high of nearly $20,000 in December 2017. This represented an approximate 3,000% increase from the halving date to the peak of the market cycle. The most recent, third Bitcoin halving occurred on May 11, 2020, at block 630,000, cutting the block reward down to the current 6.25 BTC. The price of Bitcoin on the halving date hovered around $8,600. Following this halving, Bitcoin entered another bull market, reaching a peak of around $64,000 in April 2021, which corresponds to an increase of roughly 644% from the halving date to the peak. Each BTC halving has been followed by a period of increased Bitcoin prices, though the extent and duration of these bull markets have varied. The halvings are believed to have a direct impact on the price due to the reduced rate of new Bitcoin creation, which, if demand remains constant or increases, can lead to a higher price per Bitcoin. The Fourth Bitcoin Halving It’s important to note that while the Bitcoin halvings are significant, they are not the sole drivers of Bitcoin’s price. Other factors such as regulatory changes, technological advancements, macroeconomic trends, and shifts in investor sentiment also play crucial roles in the cryptocurrency’s valuation. The next BTC halving is estimated to occur on April 24, 2024, at block 840,000, where the block reward will be reduced to 3.125 BTC. As with previous halvings, there is considerable speculation about the potential impact on the price and mining dynamics of Bitcoin. Historical patterns suggest a potential increase in Bitcoin’s price, but the actual outcome will depend on a complex interplay of market forces at the time. List Of The Next BTC Halving Dates Bitcoin halvings occur every 210,000 blocks, which, with an average block time of roughly 10 minutes, translates to approximately every four years. Given that the last halving occurred in May 2020, we can project the next BTC halvings by adding four years to the previous halving date, keeping in mind that variations in actual block times can cause slight deviations from these estimates. Here is a projected list of the next BTC halving dates until the emission of new bitcoins reaches zero: The Next BTC Halving: Expected at block 840,000, around April 2024, reducing the block reward to 3.125 BTC. 2028 Halving: Expected at block 1,050,000, reducing the block reward to 1.5625 BTC. 2032 Halving: Expected at block 1,260,000, reducing the block reward to 0.78125 BTC. 2036 Halving: Expected at block 1,470,000, reducing the block reward to 0.390625 BTC. 2040 Halving: Expected at block 1,680,000, reducing the block reward to 0.1953125 BTC. 2044 Halving: Expected at block 1,890,000, reducing the block reward to 0.09765625 BTC. 2048 Halving: Expected at block 2,100,000, reducing the block reward to 0.048828125 BTC. 2052 and Beyond: The next BTC halvings will continue every four years, with the block reward continuing to halve until it becomes negligible. The process will continue until the maximum supply of 21 million bitcoins has been reached, which is estimated to occur by the year 2140. After the final Bitcoin has been mined, miners will no longer receive block subsidies and will rely solely on transaction fees as compensation for their contribution to the network’s security. Projecting the Next BTC Halving Date When Is The Next BTC Halving Date The next BTC halving is projected to occur when the Bitcoin blockchain reaches block 840,000. Based on the average time it takes to mine a block, the halving events have historically taken place approximately every four years. Given the current block height and the average block time, the next BTC halving is estimated to happen in April 2024. Current Data And Prediction Of The Next BTC Halving Date As of the latest data, the next BTC halving is anticipated to occur in April 2024. However, the exact date cannot be predicted with absolute certainty due to the variable nature of block times; it could potentially occur in late March or extend into May 2024. The most precise estimates suggest that the event will likely take place on April 20, 2024, at 10:24:52 AM UTC, according to CoinWarz. These predictions are based on the current hashrate, or the total computational power, being used to mine and process transactions on the Bitcoin network. Fluctuations in hashrate can affect block times and thus could slightly alter the expected date of the halving. It’s important to note that while these predictions are made with the best available data, they should be considered as estimates rather than exact timings.

Historical Market Trends Pre- And Post-Halving Historically, Bitcoin has exhibited significant price movements both in anticipation of and following halving events. The halving tends to create a bullish sentiment as the supply of new bitcoins entering the market slows down. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital has delineated the Bitcoin market cycle into five distinct phases surrounding the next BTC halving event, based on historical patterns: Pre-Halving Period: With approximately 5.5 months until the April 2024 halving, history suggests that any significant price retracements in this phase can offer substantial ROI for investors in the months following the halving. Pre-Halving Rally: Roughly 60 days before the halving, a rally typically ensues as investors buy into the hype, anticipating a sell-off post-event. Pre-Halving Retrace: Around the time of the halving, the market often experiences a retrace. This was -38% in 2016 and -20% in 2020, leading to doubts about the halving’s bullish impact. Re-Accumulation: Post-halving, a period of re-accumulation occurs, often marked by investor exit due to the slow pace of price movement and lack of immediate gains. Parabolic Uptrend: Once Bitcoin exits the re-accumulation phase, it typically enters a parabolic uptrend, leading to accelerated growth and new all-time highs. FAQs About The Next BTC Halving What Is The Bitcoin Network? The Bitcoin network is a decentralized digital ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions across a network of computers. It is powered by blockchain technology, which ensures security and transparency by allowing multiple copies of the data to be stored on nodes across the network. When Is The Next BTC Halving Date? The next BTC halving is estimated to occur on April 24, 2024, but the exact date may vary based on the network’s hashrate and block time. Are There Websites For The Next BTC Halving Date? Yes, there are several websites that provide countdowns to the next BTC halving, including NiceHash, Bitcoinsensus, CoinWarz, and Blockchair. What Is The Bitcoin Halving? The Bitcoin halving is an event that halves the rate at which new bitcoins are generated by miners. It occurs every 210,000 blocks, roughly every four years, as a part of Bitcoin’s deflationary monetary policy. What Is The BTC Halving Countdown? The BTC halving countdown is a timer that counts down to the next BTC halving event, indicating how much time is left until the block reward for miners is halved. Why Are BTC Halvings Occurring Every 4 Years? BTC halvings are scheduled to occur every 210,000 blocks, which roughly translates to every four years. This is designed to create a predictable and decreasing supply of new bitcoins, mimicking the extraction curve of a finite resource like gold. What Will Happen After The Last BTC Halving?

42419105,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDqVJ,1699654167,We've Seen the FTX Collapse Before,"Halloween marked the 12-year anniversary of the collapse of MF Global, the eighth largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, where a major political donor caused a multi-billion dollar shortfall of customer segregated funds by transferring them to cover losses on proprietary trading.  Sound familiar?  James Koutoulas is co-founder of the Commodity Customer Coalition and trustee of the LetsGoBrandon.com Foundation.  It should if you’ve been following the trial of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, aka SBF, who was just convicted on seven counts of criminal charges and faces up to 110 years in prison. The federal criminal case was almost unprecedented in efficiency, resulting in a conviction less than a year after FTX collapsed and charges were brought.  See also: 'Unanimous Verdict, Your Honor': Sam Bankman-Fried's Conviction  Although SBF’s trial was as speedy as they come, his hundreds of thousands of potential victims will likely have to wait a long time for restitution. An estimated $8 billion worth of customer assets were lost in the FTX fraud. While the exchange’s current leadership — led by bankruptcy expert John J. Ray III, of Enron fame — has been slowly clawing back some of those funds, it is still an open question how much and when any assets will be returned to FTX users.  The quick criminal conviction of SBF stands in sharp contrast to a very similar case: MF Global.  MF Global was a 200-year-old commodity broker which installed former Goldman Sachs co-CEO Jon Corzine as CEO in an attempt to turn the sleepy broker into an investment bank. Corzine then risked virtually all of MF Global’s firm capital into risky distressed European Sovereign Debt — at 30:1 leverage.  Corzine used convoluted and offshore systems to hide this concentrated risk from credit rating agencies for 17 months waiting for his trade to hopefully come to fruition. But before that happened the risk was exposed, MF Global’s credit downgraded and the firm received a billion dollar margin call from its biggest lender, JPMorgan Chase.  Corzine then ordered the falsification of a segregated account statement to give himself plausible deniability to transfer customer customer funds to meet his margin call. This transfer was done on taped lines and resulted in the first shortfall in customer segregated funds in U.S. history. Approximately $1.6 billion was lost.  I was then a 30-year-old manager of hedge fund Typhon Capital Management and non-practicing attorney, but one who had never litigated nor taken a class in bankruptcy. Two of my customers had chosen to clear separately managed accounts with MF (then the world’s largest non-bank commodity broker), and so I did what I could to help by getting a temporary New York law license and filing an emergency motion on their behalf.  From a void of action to the New York Times profiling my three person firm, putting us on the first page of the business section, the story went viral and over 1,000 people a day began calling our office asking for help. At Typhon, my little sister Diana handled so many calls she heard phones ringing in her sleep for weeks.  One of those callers was John L. Roe, a commodity broker with 1,000 customer accounts at MF Global and a father in Congress, Phil Roe. John had the idea to start the Commodity Customer Coalition, a voluntary effort to coordinate resources, and wrote our white paper explaining the importance of the bankruptcy on the entire American economy.  Corzine took his customers’ money, and sent it to JPMorgan to meet margin calls ... which is exceedingly similar to SBF using FTX depositors’ funds to cover trading losses...  Before you know it, we were representing virtually all of the 38,000 customers pro bono with help from my Northwestern law professor, J. Samuel Tenenbaum, and Barnes and Thornburg lawyers Trace Schmelz and David Powlen, with Hillary Escadeja, Susan Osmanski and David Rosen rounding out our small but very capable team of volunteers.  As mentioned, MF Global collapsed after running a $1.6 billion shortfall resulting in the freezing of $6.7 billion in customer assets and trader customers being kicked off the trading floor by security since their accounts were completely inaccessible. However, Corzine, a former U.S. senator and governor of New Jersey, was only questioned by the FBI a year after the bankruptcy.  He was never even charged. In Obama’s last week in office, Corzine received a civil settlement with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission of only $5 million dollars despite the huge shortfall and his $300 million net worth.  Like SBF who donated millions to political candidates, Corzine was one of President Obama’s largest donation bundlers and was also one of Hillary Clinton’s chief fundraisers. Notably, both Corzine and SBF were friends with Gary Gensler and had unprecedented access to him when Gensler chaired the CFTC and SEC, respectively.  See also: Congress' FTX Problem: 1 in 3 Members Got Cash From SBF  MF Global’s clients eventually received 101 cents on the dollar thanks in large part to the volunteer efforts of the Commodity Customer Coalition, which designed an efficient interim claims process, hammered the pair of bankruptcy trustees both in and out of court and before Congress and successfully pressured JPMorgan Chase into returning $1 billion in customer funds to the bankruptcy estate that Corzine improperly sent to the bank.  It is my legal opinion that Corzine unquestionably committed fraud and violated federal laws in a regulated commodity broker that was publicly traded and also subject to regulations including Sarbanes-Oxley, which mandates a high level of internal controls (of which MF Global had virtually none).  Time and again, we have been told that the crypto industry needs regulation in order to prosecute wrongdoers.  Further, Corzine took his customers’ money, and sent it to JPMorgan to meet margin calls in MF Global’s name which is exceedingly similar to SBF using FTX depositors’ funds to cover trading losses at his proprietary trading firm, Alameda Research.  Corzine also likely committed perjury in congressional testimony. He said “I simply do not know where the money is” despite being on taped lines ordering the illicit transfers and abuse of customer liquidity to fund operations.  When the Department of Justice, which had primary jurisdiction over his many alleged crimes, did not charge Corzine, the CCC drafted an indictment and charging memo for felony theft under Tennessee state law and presented it to the state attorney general, who did not bring charges, either.  Time and again, we have been told that the crypto industry needs regulation in order to prosecute wrongdoers. When looking at the crypto industry and markets domiciled in the U.S., it is my sense that intellectually-honest advocates of good faith can disagree on whether a certain crypto token is a ""security” or whether it must be traded on a registered exchange or broker, though since there are none, statutes and regulations need to be passed to provided for registered crypto exchanges.  In fact, these issues, and many others, are vigorously winding their way through our federal courts system today (including in my suit- Koutoulas vs. SEC in SDFL, which moves to quash an administrative subpoena issued on the non-security letsgobrandon.com meme coin).  The courts have already issued some important decisions; the federal appellate courts are being petitioned to weigh in, and like the graybeard case in SEC v. Howey (which essentially established securities regulations in the U.S. as known today), the U.S. Supreme Court will almost certainly be asked to make its mark.  See also: Coinbase Wins Supreme Court Ruling in Arbitration Lawsuit  And that is only the judicial branch, Congress has also passed piecemeal legislation and is contemplating more comprehensive legislation.  Crypto-haters howl that the industry is the Wild, Wild West claiming it has evaded U.S. financial regulation. MF Global is evidence “beyond a reasonable doubt” that the haters are delusional. Regulation is neither a cure-all nor preventative for crime. MF Global was a NYSE publicly-traded company registered with the SEC, CFTC, NFA, CME, FINRA and the Federal Reserve and none of those regulations prevented crime nor prosecuted it.  In the end, MF’s shareholders and its customers, whose segregated accounts were supposedly sacrosanct pursuant to federal law and regulation, were all left holding an empty bag. The regulators and prosecutors? Crickets.  While the lack of cryptocurrency statutes and regulation in the U.S. did push much of FTX’s fraud offshore, the U.S. still has sound anti-fraud laws that transcend regulatory regimes and are instead limited only by the will of prosecutors to bring cases against high-profile targets.  But, between these two multi-billion dollar fraud cases, it was the major political donor operating in an unregulated industry who has been convicted while the other donor subject to six regulators was never even charged. Many cynics thought SBF’s millions in political donations would help him escape justice, but pending sentencing, that doesn’t seem to be true.  So, does his conviction give us hope that the two-tier justice system in the U.S. isn’t as bad as we thought? Or was SBF’s criminality just too overwhelming to ignore?  One thing’s for certain, the rise and fall of FTX proves that regulation is not a precursor for criminal prosecution, and rubs salt in the wounds of the 38,000 MF Global victims for whom justice was never served — despite that firm being regulated by virtually every financial regulator in the U.S.",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,James Koutoulas,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/11/10/weve-seen-the-ftx-collapse-before,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c8d6cebee454d9d964e20bebfb773f0dec35dc86-1586x892.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While addressing the challenges of liquidity fragmentation between Layer 2 (L2) solutions, the collaboration aims to reinvent Ethereum (ETH) roll-up transactions, making them “more cost-effective and efficient.” Rapid And Affordable Ethereum Transactions? In a joint statement released on November 10, the NEAR Foundation and Eigen Labs unveiled their plans to develop a “fast finality layer” to power rapid and inexpensive transactions for Ethereum rollups, including cross-rollup transactions. Per the announcement, the collaboration seeks to significantly reduce transaction processing times to a mere 3-4 seconds, a notable improvement compared to the minutes, hours, or even days it currently takes. Moreover, it aims to make transactions 4000 times cheaper than existing options, providing a cost advantage for users. Related Reading: What Is Shiba Inu: An Explainer And SHIB Price Prediction Furthermore, one of the partnership’s key objectives is to establish “secure and low-latency” cross-rollup communication, resolving the challenges faced by developers and founders working with rollups. As announced, the Fast Finality Layer will maintain the “security guarantees” of Ethereum while introducing additional guarantees from the NEAR and EigenLayer technologies. Both protocols believe this solution promises to enhance liquidity by reducing fragmentation between Layer-2 solutions, empowering developers to make informed decisions regarding the sequencers they prefer for transaction processing. NEAR And Eigen Labs Partnership For ‘Seamless Web3 Integration’ Illia Polosukhin, co-founder of NEAR Protocol, expressed pride in partnering with Eigen Labs, emphasizing that the fast finality layer showcases the technological strengths of NEAR while making the Open Web more user-friendly. Polosukhin further stated: NEAR Foundation is proud to partner with such an excellent team as Eigen Labs to offer a fast finality layer for ETH rollups. The fast finality layer showcases the strengths of NEAR’s technology while making the Open Web more usable, which has always been the core goal for NEAR. It will also help defragment liquidity for Ethereum rollups and make all of Web3 more interoperable as a result. For his part, Sreeram Kannan, founder of Eigen Labs, shared his enthusiasm for the partnership and highlighted the mutual benefits it brings. In his words, the collaboration will leverage the innovative technologies of both NEAR and EigenLayer, enabling faster, cheaper, and easier development on the Ethereum network. Related Reading: Is A Bearish Reversal Coming For Bitcoin? This Metric May Warn So The collaboration between NEAR and Eigen Labs marks a significant milestone for EigenLayer, as it enables fast settlement for cross-rollup transactions and demonstrates wider adoption of restaking across the Ethereum ecosystem and beyond. For NEAR, the partnership extends to enhancing the NEAR-Ethereum Rainbow Bridge by transitioning it to an actively validated service (AVS). This transition is expected to enhance bridging capabilities between NEAR and Ethereum, enabling faster transaction finality, increased security guarantees, and improved decentralization. The collaboration is expected to launch a testnet in Q1 2024, and further details will be shared then. This partnership between the NEAR Foundation and Eigen Labs holds great promise for advancing Ethereum rollup transactions, improving liquidity, and driving the broader adoption of Web3 technologies.

On-chain data shows that the attacker drained 1,577 ETH from Raft, then sent 1,570 ETH to a burn address – destroying most of the stolen assets and leaving only 7 ETH for themselves. The hacker's address received 18 ETH via crypto mixer service Tornado Cash before the attack, blockchain data on Arkham shows, likely to fund transactions.  After executing the transfers and paying the blockchain fees, the exploiter's crypto wallet was left with only 14 ETH, fewer funds than the initial 18 ETH.  This means that they face a 4 ETH loss on the whole maneuver.  Raft's R dollar-pegged stablecoin dropped as much as 50% from its supposed $1 price in the immediate aftermath, but later rebounded to around 70 cents, Coinmarketcap data shows.  Raft co-funder David Garai confirmed in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that the platform was targeted by an attack.

42419106,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDqWL,1699650554,Can Everyday Traders Trust DeFi's Automated Market Makers?,"This post is part of Consensus Magazine’s Trading Week, sponsored by CME.  In light of the transformative changes in the crypto landscape, the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector has seen an extraordinary rise, followed by moments of decline.  As users grapple with intricate challenges — from managing private keys to navigating various protocols — it’s evident that the simplicity once associated with traditional finance is starkly missing.  Connor O’Shea is CEO at Bril Finance.  Now, DeFi is at a crossroads, and it must overcome these obstacles and embrace a renewed emphasis on simplicity, optimization, and performant returns.  Obstacles limiting the potential of DeFi  One of the major concerns in this DeFi landscape is its volatility, which isn't just confined to fluctuating asset prices; it’s deeply entrenched in the ecosystem, as illustrated by mercurial total value locked (TVL) in DeFi. The rise to $212 billion in TVL — followed by a precipitous drop to $43.45 billion within a year — is a testament to crypto's inherent instability.  Amid these dynamics, the challenge of direct liquidity provision rears its head. Traders who venture into open platforms like Uniswap, hoping to capitalize on liquidity provision, often grapple with impermanent loss. This is a phenomenon where traders can end up with lower returns due to asset price fluctuations or negative yields.  Centralized exchanges (CEXs) have had their share of controversies, too. Recent events, such as troubling data breaches at Gemini and the collapse of FTX, have eroded trust in CEXs. Such incidents have inadvertently thrust DEXs into the limelight as viable alternatives (underscored by a significant 24% surge in DEXs following the collapse of FTX).  As DEXs capitalize on this momentum and fear, they're faced with the limitations of automated market makers (AMMs), the most common type of architecture supporting decentralized exchanges. While AMMs have been instrumental in the DEX revolution — allowing liquidity provision without traditional order books — they are fraught with challenges.  New users often find AMMs non-intuitive and difficult to navigate, especially when dealing with highly volatile trading pairs. To truly challenge CEXs, DEXs need to integrate advanced order book models that complement on-chain smart contracts.  Platforms like dYdX have ventured into this territory, but striking a balance between robust decentralization and efficient trade execution is no easy feat.  See also: Examining dYdX's Path to Profitable DeFi | Galen Moore  Central to cryptocurrency ethos is the drive for decentralization, a principle immortalized in the Bitcoin white paper. Recent incidents in the DeFi space, coupled with the broader crypto sentiment, are reshaping the narrative in favor of a more decentralized trading environment.  However, the road ahead is not without its challenges. The sharp decline in crypto assets, with ether [ETH] plunging from almost $4,800 to a low of $1,600 this year, has led to a major reduction in the TVL of staked ETH. Further, near constant DeFi exploits raise concerns about the sector's sustainability.  Empowering users  For DeFi platforms to rise from these setbacks and truly achieve their potential, a shift in strategy is imperative. A significant aspect of this resurgence hinges on user adoption. DEXs need to rectify obvious pain points and continue to innovate and cater to a hopefully expanding user base.  New solutions are stepping in to make things simpler and more transparent while staying true to the spirit of decentralization.  Imagine a platform that simplifies the user experience. Users wouldn't have to grapple with technical jargon or juggle private keys and protocols. Instead, they'd access a friendly interface that'd use powerful algorithms to make asset custody simple. The goal here is to stay agile and responsive — especially as market conditions change and address the unpredictability of TVL in DeFi.  DeFi is ultimately about building trust. Every action a protocol takes is recorded and transparent — thanks to blockchain. But solutions between chains must also be interoperable, making it easier for assets to shift between different platforms. That way users can tap into the best of what each blockchain offers.  A more collaborative approach might just be an antidote to problems individual DeFi platforms face — especially fluctuating TVLs.  The road to compliance  As the DeFi sector evolves, the emerging regulatory landscape cannot be overlooked. Global regulators — spurred by market fluctuations and concerns about accountability — are keenly eyeing DeFi. IOSCO's proposed framework emphasizes investor protection and transparent disclosures. Yet, inherent pseudonymity in DeFi poses challenges for clear oversight.  With the framework's expected release by late 2023 and member countries poised to adopt its recommendations — it's crucial for DeFi platforms to proactively adapt. Embracing compliance isn't just about meeting regulations; it's about fortifying trust and ensuring DeFi's sustainable growth in the broader financial ecosystem.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Connor O'Shea,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/11/10/can-everyday-traders-trust-defis-automated-market-makers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/98e3ae0026c04e4cbe53e396c1a173c8e12595dc-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42419115,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDqfd,1699650291,Getting Ready for Bitcoin's Catalysts,"The price of bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap, began climbing during the week of October 23 after spending much of the summer stuck around $26,000. It recently rose above $35,000 to touch its highest level since May 2022.  This post is part of Consensus Magazine's Trading Week 2023, presented by CME.  Why is bitcoin appreciating?  Some point to signs that a slate of exchange-traded funds that hold actual bitcoin — known as spot bitcoin ETFs — may soon be approved by U.S. regulators. Such approval (if granted) will provide investors with additional products to access bitcoin exposure and may attract participants who may have been sitting on the side-lines .  The approval of the futures-based ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) made history in October 2021 as one of the strongest-ever ETF launches, amassing more than $1bn in assets in just two days, and continuing to attract interest.  Another popular theory is tied to bitcoin's upcoming ""halving."" This pre-programmed adjustment to the blockchain cuts in half the reward miners receive for processing transactions and creating new bitcoin from the current 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoin per block. This event occurs after 210k blocks are mined or about every four years until the maximum supply (21MM) is reached. The next halving, Bitcoin’s fourth, is expected to happen by mid-April 2024.  In the past, this event and the associated supply reduction has coincided with a strong run-up in bitcoin’s price and could potentially lead to pre- and post-halving volatility. The geopolitical and macro backdrop for the upcoming halving is very different from previous ones and the availability of regulated, robust and liquid Bitcoin futures and options from CME Group means firms have trusted and tested products to hedge their bitcoin price risk or gain exposure.  Use futures to position your portfolio  Investors who trade in the futures market usually have one of two aims: to either hedge the price of an asset by locking in a future price or to speculate on the price direction of an asset to seek to profit from the ups and downs of futures prices.  CME Group Bitcoin and Micro Bitcoin and futures and options can help investors navigate cryptocurrency market risks and potentially profit from its opportunities. Micro Bitcoin futures traded volume has doubled from 5,9000 contracts in September 2023 to 11,9000 contracts traded in October 2023 while Bitcoin futures witnessed a 38% increase in daily volume to 13,300 contracts over the same period.  Why Trade CME Group Cryptocurrency Futures?  Cryptocurrency futures bring three main advantages for investors.  1. The contract is cash-settled in USD. There is no need to custody the coin, which removes the risk of having to safely store it. That means you don’t need to have a wallet, worry about hackings, or insurance. The futures simply track the price of bitcoin or ether, and settle in USD, so, by trading cryptocurrency futures instead of the coins themselves, investors can bypass several operational hurdles.  2. They are CFTC-regulated contracts. That means they offer several customer protections. For example, your funds are fully segregated and each trade is centrally cleared. CME Group’s clearing house becomes the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer. This substantially mitigates counterparty risk from the trade.  3. Futures make it easier for investors to short. No ""locate"" or borrow is necessary, just simply sell to gain short exposure. Bitcoin and ether are no strangers to volatility. While some investors might embrace that, others are far more risk-averse. Selling futures contracts could well play a part in their strategy. Investors who like more risk can sell (short) futures to try and profit from bitcoin or ether’s downside moves. Other investors, meanwhile, can sell (short) futures to hedge the bitcoin or ether they already own. This way, they can offset some losses if their crypto portfolio takes a dive.  Moreover futures offer investors more precision to fine tune exposure and allow them to control a large contract value with a smaller amount of capital. One Micro Bitcoin futures contract (ticker: MBT) is set to one-tenth of a bitcoin, which is 50 times smaller than a full-sized contract (ticker: BTC). One Micro Ether futures contract (ticker: MET) is one-tenth of an ether, which is 500 times smaller than its full-sized counterpart (ticker: ETH). The notional size for MBT is about $3,500 while for MET, it is about $200 (at current market prices).  If you are buying bitcoin or ether on a spot exchange, you will need to fully fund the position before you trade. An advantage with futures is that you only need to put down the initial margin requirement, or the amount of money you need as collateral to open your trade.  Institutional interest in Bitcoin futures has steadily climbed. Open interest, a measure of client demand, hit an all-time high of 20,380 contracts on October 25, equivalent to 101,900 bitcoin, representing $3.5 billion in notional value. Similarly, the number of large open interest holders (LOIH) of CME Group’s Bitcoin futures grew to a record 122 on October 24 (LOIH for Cryptocurrency futures is defined by the CFTC as an entity that holds at least 25 contracts).  This is further proof that institutional investors are warming up to bitcoin and positioning their portfolios amid renewed optimism. Retail investors, too, seem to have played their part, as evidenced by the uptick in futures-based ETF’s AUM. The rolling five-day volume in ProShares’ industry-leading Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) jumped by a staggering 420% to $340 million last week. BITO invests in CME Group Bitcoin futures.  CME Group futures are not suitable for all investors and involve the risk of loss. Full disclaimer.

Analyst Who Predicted $37,000 Reveals What’s Next","Bitcoin is still seeing an impressive run but speculations on where the asset is headed next are running wild. A crypto analyst has shared their own expectations for the leading cryptocurrency, considering both sides of the coin and the possible price marks it can achieve. Bitcoin Price Gunning For $40,000 In an extensive analysis, crypto analyst and trader FieryTrading has mapped out how the Bitcoin price could reach $40,000. The analysis which was posted on TradingView starting November 8 points out the fact that the BTC price has continued to trade in a tight bullish channel since October. Related Reading: $9 Trillion BlackRock Files Ethereum Spot ETF, What’s So Special About It? This was proven to be true when the price of the asset actually jumped above $37,000 later before the pullback to the mid-$36,000s. The steady recovery that has categorized Bitcoin dips since the rally began in October has been making higher lows, as the analyst points out. FieryTrading refers to this as something that shows that an asset is “classically getting ready for the next pump.” Further adding that: “I think that the same goes for BTC.” Source: Tradingview.com The analyst expects that Bitcoin will continue to move up in the coming, and their first target of $37,000 was already crushed on November 9. Then following this, the analyst expects “a retest of the top channel is to be expected as a confirmation of the break out.” Naturally, the price target for this resurgence has been placed at $40,000 by FieryTrading as long as the top of the channel mentioned has been hit. In a subsequent post, the analyst confirms that this has indeed happened. BTC Marks Time For Recovery In a November 9 update, FieryTrading revealed that Bitcoin has indeed hit the top of the channel which could lead to a rejection. However, the analyst explains that this rejection will only be temporary and could be followed by a breakout to the upside. The chart marks a retracement after which, the price does move toward the $40,000 target. Related Reading: Countdown to Chaos: Ethereum Insider To Expose ETH Founders’ Fraud In Weeks However, it is not set in stone that a rally to $40,000 will take place, and like any analysis, there is always the risk of it being invalidated. FieryTrading points out that Bitcoin could see massive selling that could drag the price back down to $37,000. But even this does not deter the trader who believes “It’s healthy if the price retests the top resistance of the channel.” The latest update to the analysis acknowledges a deeper crash than expected but it seems the analyst’s forecast still holds. “Eyes open for V-shape bounce. Whipsaw longs & shorts at the same time while keeping the trend intact,” FieryTrading says.

42419107,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDqXN,1699647186,"CME, Where Institutions Trade Bitcoin Futures, Flipped Binance. Is That as Bullish as It Sounds?","This post is part of Consensus Magazine’s Trading Week, sponsored by CME.  CME Group is now the place to trade bitcoin futures, apparently. For the first time in months, if not years, CME is now seeing more BTC futures trading than on the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance. This flippening, which has happened before, but doesn’t happen often, is often seen as a sign of increasing institutional interest in crypto.  CME, which incidentally but (please believe me) unrelatedly is the sponsor this week for The Node newsletter, is often seen as The Exchange for Grownups. Whereas, with Binance and co., I think very few people are putting on ties to go to work to trade bitcoin perps on a native crypto exchange.  See also: Ethereum Futures Are Now Trading on CME  Don’t just take my word for it, CoinDesk’s markets guru Omkar Godbole said CME is “considered a proxy for institutional activity” in crypto, on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover.” “What we are seeing right now is a good old pump of open interest on the CME futures,” he said. Open interest refers to the dollar value of existing futures contracts.  Perhaps this interest is being driven by bitcoin’s price, which has rallied over 100% year-to-date, and institutions want a little bit of the action. Or, it’s because they are taking bets that the narratives around a potential spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) being listed by year’s end or the Bitcoin halving on the docket for next year will spur even more buying.  Futures are a type of derivatives contract that requires buyers to purchase bitcoin at a predetermined price at a later date. They’re essentially a hedge against a future price movement, and are commonly used to bet that you can buy an asset today for less you could at a later date.  And lot’s of people seem to think bitcoin has legs to run, yet. Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan essentially said that all the bitcoin ETF hype is not fully “priced in” yet. To be sure, the chief investment officer of a crypto investment company has many incentives to believe something like that and drum up support for that thesis.  It’s also a kettle-of-worms getting into the question of whether the Bitcoin halving is priced in, especially at this point, when it is still six months away. There’s certainly something reasonable about the idea that the fewer new bitcoins released into circulation (as part of the “mining subsidy, which is halved programmatically every four years — hence “the halvening”) will be good for bitcoin’s price. It’s the same theory of supply and demand behind the idea that bitcoins, capped at 21 million coins, are scarce and therefore valuable.  But, if you believe in efficient markets, then you’d have to think a pre-scheduled event that 99.9% of all bitcoin holders know about and eagerly await would have to be “priced in.” Then again, it’s hard to say crypto markets are efficient. And the same guys who thought up the Efficient Markets theory also said it’s impossible to find a $10 bill on the street, because, if it was there, it’d already be pocketed by someone. Yet I find (and lose) money all the time, and crypto traders sometimes make money off of market inefficiencies.  Anyway, to make things even more complicated, Godbole said that typically when open interest in bitcoin futures is growing on CME, it’s an indicator that bitcoin’s price is about to drop. This isn’t a hard-and-fast rule, but has been an observable trend following the few times when CME flippened Binance. “Both times, CME's move to the top spot marked price top,” he said.  What’s more, while CME’s open interest have grown the flippening this time around may have multiple factors. First, Binance’s market share of futures contracts compared to the CME has been on a long-term decline, perhaps due to the exchange’s legal troubles in the U.S. and E.U.  See also: Citigroup to Trade Bitcoin Futures on the CME?  And lastly, there’s also a difference between the types of derivatives traded on CME, where a few traders took out bullish bets, and on Binance, which actually had a high amount of open shorts (bearish bets on BTC’s price) that were liquidated during the recent price rally, Godbole said.  “So, while we're seeing a spike in CME contracts, that doesn't necessarily mean that the futures market is suddenly exploding,” he said.  What does this all mean for bitcoin? Are the institutions here? Will the price continue to climb? Dear reader, if I knew I wouldn’t be writing about it — I’d be gambling.

This enterprise software company, known for its substantial Bitcoin holdings, recently acquired an additional 155 BTC for $5.3 million. With Bitcoin’s current trading price above $37,000, MicroStrategy’s investment boasts roughly $1.1 billion in paper profits, underscoring the asset’s appeal to corporate investors. In October, @MicroStrategy acquired an additional 155 BTC for $5.3 million and now holds 158,400 BTC.

Despite facing some challenges, the platform has seen remarkable growth in its ecosystem and significant developments in various aspects of its platform. Algorand Witnesses Surge In Transaction Volume In Q3 Per the report, the non-fungible token (NFT) Rewards program implemented by Algorand garnered notable success, leading to a significant increase of 321% in NFT-related transactions compared to the previous quarter. This program, initiated through a governance vote in Q2, allocated 500,000 ALGO in rewards to NFT marketplace users to stimulate activity. Related Reading: $5 Million Reward: Justin Sun’s Bold Move Against Poloniex Attackers Furthermore, during Q3, Algorand experienced a surge in user adoption, adding 1.1 million new addresses and witnessing a 2% increase in total daily average transactions compared to the previous quarter. However, Algorand’s total stablecoin market cap faced a decline of 58% in Q3, largely attributed to the decreasing market caps of stablecoins on the platform. Despite this, USDC (USD Coin) surpassed USDT (Tether), accounting for 76% of the stablecoin market cap. In the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, Algofi, Algorand’s largest DeFi protocol by Total Value Locked (TVL), began winding down operations in July. As a result, Folks Finance emerged as the dominant DeFi protocol on Algorand, capturing 55% of the DeFi TVL in Q3. Algorand’s quarterly revenue, including fees collected by the protocol, grew by 25% in ALGO terms; however, it declined by 23% in USD terms due to the daily average ALGO price. Algorand’s governance participation experienced a decline of 8% in Q3, accounting for 30% of the circulating supply. The platform’s network upgrade in Q3 allowed for increased throughput, lower blocktime, and support for quantum-secure interoperability via State Proofs. Looking ahead, Algorand has announced plans to launch AlgoKit 2.0, a developer-focused tooling that aims to simplify the developer experience. It also intends to shift its network topology to a peer-to-peer design and transition to an incentivized consensus economic model in 2024. ALGO Struggles To Break Key Resistance Regarding price action, ALGO, currently ranked 53rd among the largest cryptocurrencies in the market, has faced challenges amid the recent bullish surge in most cryptocurrencies. The token is currently trading at $0.1217, experiencing a decline of over 7% in the past 24 hours. Despite this retracement, ALGO has shown impressive gains across other time frames. Related Reading: Ethereum At $2,100: Why Path To $2,500 Is Now All Clear Over 7 and 14 days, ALGO has recorded significant gains of 10% and 21%, respectively. The best performance was seen in the 30 days, with a surge of 28%. However, ALGO has faced a year-to-date decline of over 62%, in contrast to most of the crypto market, where major cryptocurrencies have nearly doubled in value since the end of the crypto winter. Moreover, ALGO has struggled to surpass its 200-day moving average (MA), a significant resistance level. This has resulted in the recent pullback, preventing the token from reaching levels not seen since July, where it reached $0.1364. The future trajectory of ALGO remains uncertain. It will depend on continued developments and growth in its ecosystem to propel the token towards its yearly high of $0.2898, reached in February. Alternatively, ALGO may consolidate below its moving averages.

Low volumes suggest limited market participation at a particular price level, potentially leading to greater price volatility and reduced market depth.  Conversely, higher trading volumes signify broader market participation, indicating a stronger consensus and offering a more dependable basis for price movements, thereby bolstering the credibility of the signal.  Trade volume recovery in BTC and ETH, the most watched liquidity metric, is eye-catching. Two of the top-15 trading volume days since the market top two years ago were recorded during this recent rally. And most of the other high-volume days happened as dramatic company failures were taking place in 2022, or as several mid-sized U.S. banks got into difficulty in March 2023. BTC Spot volumes, which until September were breaking three-year lows, have steeply recovered and are now approaching six-month highs.  But this is not the whole story. Digging deeper into liquidity trends can provide us further insight.  Strong action in derivatives, especially CME  Futures open interest (OI) in BTC and ETH just crossed the $20 billion mark for the first time since the FTX meltdown in November 2022, led by BTC on the back of excitement around the highly anticipated U.S. spot ETF launch.  Notably, but perhaps not surprisingly, this increase is led by institutional capital. The CME, a favorite venue for large traditional finance companies to get crypto exposure, gained the most market share across all venues and is close to overtaking Binance as the leading BTC futures exchange by OI.  A similar trend can also be seen on options.  Open interest in BTC options just crossed $16 billion, and volumes are now at all-time highs. Much of this action is translated to spot prices because a relevant part of these flows is likely hedged into spot. There’s a flipside: a more pronounced derivatives market means there’s more inherent leverage in the system. So the risk of forced liquidations exacerbating price movements will likely increase from here.  Spot Order books tightened and revealed a relative lack of sellers  Order book depth – an alternative liquidity metric that gauges how much capital would be required to change the asset price by a certain percentage given the limit orders in place at any time – has tightened over the past few months, despite the strong price increases.  The chart below shows the 1% depth of book for BTC and ETH (top and bottom, respectively) in U.S. dollars and native units (left and right, respectively) over 2023. There is a decrease over the past 3-5 months, whichever chart you look at. And the sell side of the orderbook is trending toward shrinking by more than the buy side, suggesting a lack of sellers relative to buyers.  Busy derivatives dynamics meet a tight spot market  The chart below shows annualized realized volatility for BTC and ETH using a seven-day lookback period to capture the recent price surge. Although volatility picked up recently, it remains relatively low for both BTC and ETH, as it did not break above 63% on an annualized basis, which is below the median value during the previous bull market in 2020 and 2021.  This matters to liquidity because volatility usually drives higher trading activity. BTC’s current spot volumes adjusted by volatility are already in the top quartile of the 2020/2021 bull market cycle.  This rally feels different  Stronger interest from more traditional institutional investors and a market with relatively few sellers amid increasing but still relatively low volatility point to the market shifting gears to a new phase.  Looking forward, even if the possibility of interim corrections grows from there and the macro environment remains cloudy, this rally might be the start of the next bull market.

The Midas stablecoin project intends to buy Treasuries via asset manager BlackRock and use Circle Internet Financial's USDC stablecoin as an on-ramp, according to the deck. Custody technology provider Fireblocks and blockchain analytics firm Coinfirm are also listed as institutional partners.  Yields offered by assets in traditional finance (TradFi) like U.S. Treasuries currently exceed yields on conventional DeFi products. The solution, as the Midas presentation deck states, is to tokenize TradFi products so they're available in the DeFi ecosystem.  So-called tokenized real-world assets are a hot corner of the digital-asset space, drawing attention from TradFi firms that have long tried to get key parts of markets and finance onto blockchain infrastructure given the potential efficiencies. Treasuries have been an area of focus, with large growth in 2023.

The Midas team includes Fabrice Grinda, founder and executive chairman of blank check company Global Technology Acquisition Corp. (GTAC); and Dennis Dinkelmeyer, who is vice president of GTAC.  The Midas stUSD token is 100% backed by U.S. Treasuries and issued as a debt security under German law, according to the deck.

Digital asset funds overall attracted large inflows over the past weeks as spot bitcoin ETF optimism spread to the broader crypto markets.  Bitcoin [BTC] investment fund BTC holdings have risen to the highest ever alongside the token's continuing rally thanks in part to optimism about coming approval for a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF).  According to investment advisory firm ByteTree, token holdings this week rose to 863,434, taking out the previous record high touched in April 2022. Over the past month, funds have added about 22,100 bitcoins.  ""Little wonder the price has been so strong of late,"" ByteTree founder Charlie Morris said.  Broader crypto funds enjoyed an uptick in fresh cash over the past weeks as well, with digital asset management firm CoinShares reporting $767 million in net inflows over the past six weeks, the most over such a time frame since the 2021 bull market.  Further, James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, earlier Friday noted inflows into digital asset funds so far this year have now topped $1 billion.  Bitcoin, of course, is the overwhelming driver of these inflows as investors chase rising prices ahead of what's now expected to be imminent approval of multiple spot BTC ETFs.  Speaking to CoinDesk earlier this week, Matt Hougan, Bitwise Asset Management’s Chief Investment Officer, suggested things have a long way to go before the spot ETF approval is priced in. Even with all the news hitting of late, it's Hougan's contention that the majority of financial advisors continue to believe a spot ETF isn't coming until 2025 or later.

Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a curious observer, the world of SHIB awaits, and we’re here to navigate it with you. Overview: What Is Shiba Inu Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a decentralized cryptocurrency that was created in August 2020. It is often considered an alternative to Dogecoin and has gained popularity as a meme coin. Shiba Inu ecosystem has its own decentralized exchange, layer-2 blockchain and leverages smart contracts on the Ethereum network. It’s known for its strong and active community, often referred to as the “Shib Army,” that plays a significant role in its development and promotion. The Genesis Of Shiba Inu Coin In the annals of history, the creation story of the cryptocurrency Shiba Inu will certainly be one for the ages. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous entity or group known as Ryoshi, SHIB was positioned as an Ethereum-based counterpart to the joke cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE). But right from its inception, Shiba Inu, represented by the ticker SHIB, was meant to be more than just a meme coin; it was to embody a decentralized movement. The tokenomics of SHIB were quite unorthodox. The total supply was fixed at a whopping one quadrillion coins (1,000,000,000,000,000 SHIB). In a strategic maneuver aimed to create scarcity and a fair distribution, Ryoshi locked 50% of the total supply in Uniswap for liquidity. The remaining half was sent to an address known to belong to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. This act of sending 500 trillion Shiba Inu tokens, which at one point were valued at billions of dollars, was not just a publicity stunt but also a testament to the trust in Buterin’s stewardship over the token. Vitalik Buterin Performs Inaugural Shiba Inu Burn Remarkably, Buterin’s involvement took a dramatic turn when, in May 2021, he donated more than 50 trillion SHIB, worth more than $1 billion at the time, to the India COVID-Crypto Relief Fund. This move was both celebrated for its philanthropic impact and scrutinized for its significant influence on SHIB’s market dynamics. Buterin later “burned” — or permanently removed from circulation — approximately 410 trillion SHIB, sending them to an inaccessible wallet, effectively taking them out of the total supply and increasing the scarcity of the remaining tokens. Buterin explained: I’ve decided to burn 90% of the remaining Shiba tokens in my wallet. The remaining 10% will be sent to a (not yet decided) charity with similar values to cryptorelief (preventing the large-scale loss of life) but with more long-term orientation. The decision by Buterin to burn a majority of his Shiba coin holdings was a pivotal moment for the token. By reducing the available supply by sending SHIB to a “dead wallet” address, Buterin performed the first ever “Shiba Inu burn” (or shorter “SHIB burn”). With this, Buterin created a precedent for the future where Shiba Inu burns are an important tool for the SHIB community, often dubbed as “SHIB army”, to create an upward pressure on the price per token based on supply and demand dynamics. Understanding The Culture Behind Shiba Cryptocurrency The Shiba Inu cryptocurrency is not just another altcoin; it’s a cultural phenomenon, just like Dogecoin. It is the epitome of how memes can influence the digital economy. The coin thrives on a narrative that is light-hearted and community-driven, but it’s also underpinned by a serious technology that has attracted a broad investor base. The culture of the cryptocurrency Shiba Inu extends beyond speculation; it is about being part of a “Shib Army,” a group of supporters and holders who share a common love for the meme and the vision of the project. This community supports the token with artistic contributions, social media presence, and various projects that promote the Shiba adoption and use of SHIB as a currency in real life. Shiba Inu Coin: Shibarium Goes Live On August 16, 2023, the community witnessed the launch of Shibarium, its layer-2 blockchain solution. This Shibarium launch was not just a milestone – it was the dawn of a new era for the SHIB army. However, the initial excitement was tempered by unforeseen technical issues on the Shibarium release date. The layer-2 blockchain experienced a rocky start due to an overwhelming surge in traffic. This unexpected volume led to network congestion, affecting the user experience. The community reported a “non-functional” RPC, a subpar blockchain explorer, and an overall “sloppy” experience on day one. Remarkably, the Shiba Inu coin developers were quick to address these concerns. They clarified that there were no issues with the Shibarium bridge itself. Instead, the problems arose from the massive influx of users eager to engage with the new platform. The team worked diligently to manage the situation, ensuring that test blocks on the network processed as normal. Despite the initial challenges, Shibarium’s importance cannot be overstated. It is designed to significantly reduce transaction fees and increase speed, which is crucial for the token’s mass adoption. Shibarium also enables developers to build decentralized apps (dApps), fostering a more robust and versatile SHIB ecosystem. Overall, Shibarium’s potential is transformative. By operating on top of Ethereum, it promises a more scalable and cost-effective platform for transactions. Ultimately, this layer-2 solution is not just a technical enhancement but a strategic move to position the Shiba coin as a formidable player in the Web3 space. Shiba Inu Price Predictions: What You Need To Know Shiba Inu Price And What Influences It The Shiba Inu price, like any cryptocurrency, is subject to a complex interplay of factors. Market conditions, social media trends, and the inherent volatility of the meme coin sector play significant roles. Shiba Inu price predictions are dependent on the following factors: Market Conditions: The broader cryptocurrency market’s health often sways the Shiba Inu price. Bullish trends can lift it, while bearish sentiments can drag it down. Social Media Influence: SHIB’s origins and popularity are deeply rooted in social media hype. Tweets from influential figures or viral hashtags can trigger price swings. Investor Behavior: Both retail and institutional investors impact the Shiba Inu price. Their investment and divestment patterns can cause notable fluctuations. Technological Developments: Updates like the Shibarium launch can affect prices. They can signal improvements in utility and potential for growth. Supply and Demand: The circulating supply versus demand for Shiba coins can influence its price. Events like Shiba Inu burns, which reduce supply, can increase value if demand remains steady. Regulatory News: Cryptocurrency regulations can instill fear or confidence among investors. Positive regulatory news can lead to price surges, while negative news can cause declines. Economic Indicators: Global economic indicators, such as inflation rates and currency values, can also affect the Shiba Inu price. Investors may turn to or away from cryptocurrencies based on economic conditions. Understanding these factors is crucial for anyone looking to invest in the Shiba Inu coin. While making Shiba Inu price predictions can be very challenging, keeping an eye on these influences can provide insights into its potential price movements. Shiba Inu Price Prediction From a technical analysis standpoint, the SHIB/USD chart showcases intriguing patterns that investors should be aware of. For a long-term Shiba Inu price prediction, we observe the weekly chart. A few key elements stand out: Quadruple Bottom: Often regarded as a bullish reversal pattern, the quadruple bottom indicates a strong level of support where the price touches a particular level four times and rebounds each time. In the SHIB/USD weekly chart, this pattern can be visualized at points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. Each time the Shiba Inu price dropped, it bounced back within two weeks, showcasing resilience. Descending Triangle Pattern: Contrasting the bullish inclination of the quadruple bottom is the descending triangle. This is typically viewed as a bearish formation, characterized by a series of lower highs (blue line) converging to a horizontal support line at $0.00000715. The descending triangle seen on the Shiba Inu price chart suggests that while there’s a robust support level, buyers are becoming less aggressive as time goes on, reflected by the decreasing peaks. SHIB Price Analysis Using Fibonacci Levels Navigating the Fibonacci retracement landscape, we can make several Shiba Inu price predictions. These are the pivotal levels: 4.236 at $0.00005599 3.618 at $0.00004870 2.618 at $0.00003690 1.618 at $0.00002509 1.0 at $0.00001780 (August 2022 high) 0.786 at $0.00001527 0.618 at $0.00001329 0.5 at $0.00001190 0.382 at $0.00001051 0.236 at $0.00000878 Currently, SHIB is testing the waters around the $0.00000878 (0.236) level, which serves as a crucial resistance. Should the Shiba coin breach this, the price might venture to higher Fibonacci levels, aligning with the bullish Shiba Inu price prediction of the quadruple bottom. Conversely, if SHIB starts trending downwards, breaching the descending triangle’s neckline, it might signal a shift in momentum towards the bears. The support at $0.00000715 is crucial for bullish Shiba Inu price prediction. Only if this line holds on a weekly or 2-week view, bullish momentum for SHIB can be assumed in the long term. Ultimately, the SHIB must break through the descending trend line (blue) and make new highs on the weekly chart in order to break out of the current bearish territory. To summarize our Shiba Inu price prediction: While the quadruple bottom on SHIB’s chart offers a beacon of bullish hope, the descending triangle tempers this optimism. These patterns highlight the tug-of-war between bulls and bears, making it vital for investors to stay alert to volume indicators and potential pattern confirmations or violations. As always, investors should balance chart analysis with other fundamental and macro factors before making any trading decisions. The Shiba Inu Burn Rate And Its Impact On Price The concept of “Shiba burning” or “SHIB burns” is a deflationary mechanism used by many cryptocurrencies, including SHIB. It involves permanently removing tokens from circulation, which can impact the price by altering the supply-demand dynamic. Understanding The Shiba Inu Coin Burn Rate: The Shiba Inu burn rate refers to the speed at which tokens are being burned. An increased Shiba burn rate means more Shiba coins are being destroyed over a given period. Impact on Shiba Inu Price Predictions: Theoretically, reducing the supply of tokens available should increase the value of the remaining tokens, assuming demand stays the same or grows. However, the impact of the Shiba Inu burn rate on its price is not always straightforward or immediate. Moreover, one has to consider that the SHIB supply is massive which means that even 100 million SHIBs burned, for example, is quite small compared to the circulating supply. Long-Term Effects Of Shiba Inu Burns: While short-term price movements may not always reflect changes in the Shiba Inu burn rate, over the long term, consistent Shiba burning can lead to a reduced total supply, which could potentially drive up the price if the demand for SHIB remains strong or increases. In summary, while the Shiba Inu burn rate is an important factor that can influence Shiba Inu price predictions, its impact must be considered alongside other market conditions. The effect of the Shiba Inu burn on price is a complex interplay and may not always yield immediate results. Shiba Inu Coin Future: What To Expect The Shiba Inu future hinges on several key factors that go beyond mere speculation and Shiba Inu price predictions. Here’s what to anticipate in the broader scope: Utility and Shiba Inu Adoption: For SHIB to sustain and potentially increase its value, the development of real-world utility is crucial. The coin’s ability to prove itself as more than a meme can lead to greater Shiba Inu adoption. This includes its use in transactions, in decentralized finance (DeFi), and within its own ecosystem for services and goods. Ecosystem Development: The success of the Shibarium platform and other ecosystem projects will be pivotal. A robust and user-friendly platform can attract developers and users, contributing to the coin’s longevity and relevance. Community Engagement: The SHIB Army’s enthusiasm and collective action are significant drivers of SHIB’s popularity. Continued community engagement and growth can lead to increased visibility and demand. Market Integration: Integration with broader crypto markets and financial systems can enhance SHIB’s legitimacy. Partnerships with payment processors and financial institutions could be a sign of maturation. Innovation: Staying at the forefront of blockchain and cryptocurrency innovation can set SHIB apart. This includes embracing emerging trends like SHIB: The Metaverse and technologies that add value to the token. Competitive Landscape: SHIB will need to navigate a crowded market of altcoins and memecoins. Standing out in this competitive space requires clear differentiation and value proposition. The Technicalities of Shiba Inu Cryptocurrency SHIB is a token that operates on the Ethereum blockchain, which is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. How Shiba Inu Token Works: A Technical Overview Here’s how Shiba and the SHIB coin work technically: Blockchain Technology: SHIB is an ERC-20 token, which means it follows a set of standards allowing it to be shared, exchanged for other tokens, or transferred to a crypto wallet. The Ethereum blockchain tracks and manages the SHIB coin, verifying transactions and recording them in a secure and immutable way. Transactions And Smart Contracts: Transactions with SHIB are secured by Ethereum’s network, which uses smart contracts to execute, control, and document legally relevant events and actions according to the terms of a contract or an agreement. Decentralized Nature: As a decentralized digital currency, SHIB transactions occur directly between peers, facilitated by the Ethereum network without the need for intermediaries like banks or financial services companies. The Role Of Shibaswap In The Shiba Inu Ecosystem ShibaSwap is the proprietary decentralized exchange (DEX) of the SHIB ecosystem, which plays a significant role: Automated Market Maker (AMM): ShibaSwap functions as an AMM, using smart contracts to create markets for any pair of tokens. It allows users to swap tokens, provide liquidity, and earn rewards. Liquidity Provision and Staking: Users can lock their tokens into liquidity pools to facilitate trading on the platform and earn passive income in the form of interest from trading fees. Decentralized Governance: Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) is the governance token of ShibaSwap. The token is used for decentralized governance, allowing users to have a say in the future direction of the platform. Shibarium Explained Shibarium is a Layer-2 blockchain network closely associated with the Shiba Inu cryptocurrency ecosystem. This technology is designed to enhance the functionality and scalability of the Shiba Inu blockchain. Shibarium is a Layer-2 blockchain solution built on top of the Ethereum network. It serves as an additional layer to facilitate faster and more cost-effective transactions within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. It aims to address the limitations of the Ethereum network, such as slow transaction speeds, by providing a more efficient infrastructure for Shiba Inu’s operations. Notably, one of its primary objectives is to offer a scalable solution for the Shiba Inu community, enabling them to handle increased system demands and applications. The SHIB Army And Network of Shiba Inu Coin Shiba Inu holders, affectionately known as the SHIB Army, encompass a broad spectrum of individuals and entities. According to the latest data from CoinMarketCap and other on-chain analytics sources, the SHIB Army has grown to over 1.3 million known holders. This diverse group ranges from retail investors who hold small amounts of SHIB for speculative purposes to large entities or “whales” who hold a significant portion of the token’s supply. Shiba Inu Holders: Who Are They? Insights from CoinMarketCap provide a clearer picture of who these holders are based on their holdings and investment duration (as of November 2023). Distribution by Holdings: Small-Scale Investors: The majority of addresses, accounting for 50.21%, hold between $0 and $1,000 worth of SHIB. This significant percentage indicates a large, grassroots base of individual investors with smaller positions in the token. Mid-Level Investors: A smaller segment, 4.12% of addresses, hold between $1,000 and $100,000. These may be more serious investors who have a moderate stake in the currency’s performance. Large-Scale Investors: Addresses holding over $100,000 in SHIB make up 45.67%. This substantial portion suggests that while the number of addresses may be smaller, the amount of SHIB they control is significant. Whale Holdings: Whales: A considerable 66.61% of SHIB is held by whales, indicating that a significant majority of the token’s supply is concentrated in the hands of a few large holders. This concentration can have a substantial impact on the token’s liquidity and price volatility. Others: The remaining 33.39% is distributed among the rest of the holders, highlighting the disparity in token distribution among the SHIB Army. Addresses By Time Held: Cruisers (Medium-Term Holders): Those who have held SHIB for an intermediate duration make up 30.74%. These investors may be looking for medium-term gains or are waiting for specific project milestones before deciding on their investment’s future. Traders (Short-Term Holders): A small fraction, 3.52%, are traders. These holders likely engage in short-term buying and selling to capitalize on market fluctuations. Holders (Long-Term Investors): The majority of addresses, at 65.74%, are long-term holders. This indicates a strong conviction in the long-term potential of SHIB, with many investors holding onto their tokens despite market volatility. The Ultimate Guide How to Buy SHIB Buying the Shiba Inu coin (SHIB) is a straightforward process that can be completed on various cryptocurrency exchanges. Here’s a step-by-step guide: Choose A Cryptocurrency Exchange: Select a reputable exchange that lists SHIB. Some popular options include Coinbase, Binance, and Robinhood. Create an Account: Sign up for an account on the chosen exchange. You will need to provide some personal information and possibly verify your identity to comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. Deposit Funds: Once your account is set up, deposit funds into it. You can usually do this via bank transfer, credit card, or even other cryptocurrencies. Buy Shiba Inu: Navigate to the SHIB trading page on your exchange. Enter the amount of SHIB you want to buy and execute your trade. You can either buy at the current market price or set a limit order to purchase at a specific price. Confirm The Transaction: Review the transaction details, including any fees that apply, and confirm your purchase. How To Store SHIB After purchasing SHIB, you need to store it securely. Here are the options: Exchange Wallet: You can keep your Shiba Inu coins in your exchange account’s wallet. While convenient for trading, it’s not recommended for long-term storage due to security risks. Software Wallet: A software wallet, also known as a hot wallet, is a more secure option. These are applications that can be installed on your computer or smartphone. They offer a balance of security and convenience. Hardware Wallet: For the highest level of security, consider a hardware wallet. These are physical devices that store your SHIB offline, making them immune to online hacking attempts. Paper Wallet: A paper wallet is a physical document that contains all the data needed to generate your SHIB private keys. It’s secure but can be damaged or lost.

20019433,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560099,1699635628,Is A Bearish Reversal Coming For Bitcoin? This Metric May Warn So,"The latest trend in the Bitcoin taker buy-sell ratio could suggest a bearish reversal may be coming soon for the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Taker Buy Sell Ratio 100-Day EMA Has Encountered Resistance An analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post explained that the asset may be heading towards a correction due to the taker buy-sell ratio coming across strong resistance. The “taker buy sell ratio” is an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the Bitcoin taker buy and taker sell volumes. When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means that the taker buy or the long volume is greater than the sell volume right now. Such a trend implies that the majority shares a bullish sentiment as the investors are willing to pay a higher price for the asset. Related Reading: Ethereum At $2,100: Why Path To $2,500 Is Now All Clear On the other hand, values under the threshold suggest the dominance of a bearish mentality in the sector, as the selling pressure is greater than the current buying pressure. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 350-day moving average (MA) and 100-day exponential MA (EMA) of the Bitcoin taker buy-sell ratio over the past few years: Looks like the two metrics have crossed each other recently | Source: CryptoQuant In the graph, the quant has highlighted an interesting pattern that has repeated for these two averages of the Bitcoin taker buy-sell ratio over the years. It would appear that whenever the 100-day EMA has crossed above the 350-day MA, the cryptocurrency’s price has gone on to observe bullish momentum shortly. On the other hand, the opposite type of cross has usually been a bearish predictor for the asset. Besides these two crossovers, the interaction of the 100-day EMA with the 1-mark has also been relevant to the coin. The line crossing above the 1-mark, which serves as the boundary between the bullish and bearish sentiment regions, has often meant a reversal for the cryptocurrency. From the chart, it’s visible the bullish type of crossover happened between the 100-day EMA and 350-day MA of the Bitcoin taker buy sell ratio just recently, and what has followed so far has been a sharp rally for the asset that has now taken it to the $37,000 level. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) Jumps Another 6% As Whales Show High Activity The 100-day EMA initially continued its rise after the cross above the 350-day MA, but the line has stopped around the 1-level, implying that it has been finding resistance. A break above here would have naturally been another bullish signal for Bitcoin, but as the line has been unable to go beyond so far, rejection might take place instead. If such a pattern forms, the asset might see a bearish reversal in the coming days. BTC Price Once again, Bitcoin is challenging the $37,000 level after dipping below it during the past day.

According to Dave, Polygon is poised to enter a significant uptrend against Bitcoin, and his optimism is based on a thorough analysis of the current market dynamics. As the broader crypto market experiences a surge, with Bitcoin reaching the $36,000 level and maintaining its momentum at the time of writing, MATIC is emerging as a standout performer. Dave the Wave is particularly bullish on MATIC, stating, “If MATIC did a 3x against BTC, and BTC did a 5x against USD (US dollar)… you do the math.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Chart Described As ‘Beautiful’ By Crypto Analyst The analyst supports his claim by presenting a chart that suggests MATIC could replicate a similar pattern against Bitcoin, potentially witnessing a remarkable 200% increase from its current value to approximately 0.0000618 BTC, equivalent to $2.25.

What’s even more impressive is the seven-day surge, with MATIC experiencing a substantial 26.7% rise.

The analyst’s focus on MATIC’s performance against Bitcoin suggests a belief in its ability to outperform the leading cryptocurrency. Total crypto market cap currently at $1.3 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com By drawing parallels with historical trends and presenting a compelling chart, Dave the Wave implies that MATIC has the potential for substantial growth, positioning itself as an attractive investment option. Analysis Suggests 200% Potential Gain For investors eyeing the cryptocurrency market, especially those considering MATIC, the implications of Dave the Wave’s analysis are noteworthy. The potential for a 200% increase against Bitcoin could translate into significant gains for MATIC holders. However, it’s crucial to approach such projections with a degree of caution, as the crypto market is known for its inherent volatility. As the market continues to evolve, keeping a close eye on MATIC’s performance and monitoring any developments is advisable for investors seeking to capitalize on potential opportunities. Related Reading: Pepe Climbs 21% – What’s Igniting The Meme Coin Fire?

20015733,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560112,1699627109,$5 Million Reward: Justin Sun’s Bold Move Against Poloniex Attackers,"Crypto exchange platform Poloniex was attacked by a bad actor, losing over $60 million of its customer’s funds. The Justin Sun led the exchange and launched an investigation, which remains ongoing, to determine the identity of the attackers. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Soars Over 3,000% – What’s The Impact On Price? Poloniex Makes Offering To Attackers The crypto analytics platform Nansen data indicates that over $68 million in tokens left Poloniex over the past day. The image below shows that the attacker stole assets in ETH, BADGER, REN, OKB, NEXO, and 170 other tokens. Nansen also confirmed that the biggest losses were suffered in top assets, Ethereum and USDT, with around $11 million each. Other tokens such as ELON, USDC, SHIB, and GLM saw inferior losses but still in the millions of dollars. A few hours ago, as mentioned, the exchange launched an investigation and Justin assured its users that the platform keeps a “healthy financial position.” In that sense, Sun, also the founder of blockchain TRON, claimed that users will be reimbursed for their losses. The platform is currently exploring a partnership with other crypto exchanges to recover the fund. Sun stated: We are offering a 5% white hat bounty to the Poloniex hacker. Please return the funds to the following ETH/TRX/BTC wallets. We will give you 7 days to consider this offer before we engage law enforcement. In the crypto community, some users praised these efforts to recover the fund and encouraged the attacker or attackers to take the bounty for “pointing out vulnerabilities” in the platform’s security. However, other users were critical of the measure. One community member stated: (…) a white hat doesn’t steal funds and then ask for a bounty, whatever you’re promising, law enforcement will be involved. It’s like saying you can beat someone to death but if you take them to the hospital you’ll be safe (…). Who Is Behind The Poloniex Attack? It remains to be seen if the attacker will accept the offer. In the crypto space, many cyberattacks have been conducted by state-sponsored hacker groups, such as the infamous Lazarus Group, allegedly working for the North Korean Government. According to a report from our sister website, Bitcoinist, this group stole billions of dollars from the nascent industry in the past two years. The terrorist group is allegedly a key component of the country’s nuclear program. Jason Bartlett, a researcher at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS), said: Cryptocurrency offers Pyongyang a new kind of currency that is substantially less regulated and understood by national governments, financial institutions, and international organizations. However, cryptocurrencies also operate as an important tool for law enforcement agencies to track down and cut funding for rogue entities. Due to blockchain technology’s transparency, some criminals stay clear of digital assets and crypto exchanges.

20014700,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560060,1699624839,"Ethereum At $2,100: Why Path To $2,500 Is Now All Clear","On-chain data suggests the path to $2,500 could be open for Ethereum now that the asset has managed to cross the $2,100 mark. Ethereum Has No Major Resistance Levels Until $2,500 In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has provided an update on how the Ethereum levels are looking in terms of on-chain support and resistance. In on-chain analysis, ranges are defined as support or resistance based on how many investors acquired their coins inside them. The below chart shows the density of addresses at various levels above and below the current spot price of the cryptocurrency: The amount of holders that acquired their coins at each of the different ETH price ranges | Source: IntoTheBlock on X Generally, whenever the Ethereum price retests the cost basis of an investor, they may be more likely to show some kind of move. When this retest happens from above, the holder may be inclined to believe the price will go up again soon so they may see the retest as a “dip” and thus, might decide to buy more. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) Jumps Another 6% As Whales Show High Activity On the other hand, the investor may want to exit the market if the retest is from below, as they might fear the price would go down again in the future, and by selling at the break-even mark, they would at least avoid incurring any losses. A few investors showing such behavior is obviously not enough to cause any visible effects on the market, but if a large number of investors share the same cost basis, the asset could very well feel a sizeable reaction. From the chart, it’s visible that there are some large cost basis centers below the current Ethereum levels, suggesting the presence of strong potential support ranges. Earlier, when the asset had still been below $2,000, the $2,000 to $2,100 range posed as the last major resistance boundary to break. Since the coin has now risen above these prices, it’s possible that the range would be switching its role towards being support instead. Following this latest rally, about 75% of the holders are now in profit (that is, their cost basis is in the levels below). As is visible in the graph, there are no price ranges with a high density of investors in the upcoming price levels, until the $2,500 mark. “Does this mean it’s a clean run to a new ATH? Not necessarily,” explains IntoTheBlock. “Historically, profit-taking at these levels is common and leads to pullbacks. However, this is unlikely to significantly impact Ethereum’s long-term trajectory.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Gear Up: 200-Day SMA Rise And Historical Trend Signal $50,000 Price Target Analyst Ali Martinez has also pointed out something interesting in an X post today. He revealed that the latest rally in ETH has occurred without the support of the largest of the Ethereum whales (carrying a balance greater than 10,000 ETH), the so-called “mega whales.” Looks like the value of the metric has been moving sideways recently | Source: @ali_charts on X As highlighted in the graph, the total number of addresses owned by the Ethereum mega whales has been flat recently. “Ethereum has reclaimed the $2,000 threshold, and intriguingly, this is all happening before whales have even started buying ETH!” notes Ali.

42419120,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDqhh,1699621260,First Mover Americas: Ether Surges on BlackRock’s ETF Plans,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  BlackRock wants to create an ETF that holds Ethereum's ether (ETH), a plan that deepens the world's largest asset manager's commitment to cryptocurrencies. Following the news, the ETH price surged to the highest level of the day (Thursday), nearing $2,100 and up about 3% compared with just before the filing came out. It later gave back about half that gain, though it remains about 9% higher than 24 hours before. The company's plan was revealed in a filing by Nasdaq, the U.S. exchange where BlackRock will seek to list the product, which will need regulatory approval. Earlier on Thursday, it emerged that the corporate entity ""iShares Ethereum Trust"" had been registered in the state of Delaware; iShares is the name of BlackRock's ETF division.  Ether's (ETH) BlackRock (BLK)-prompted surge past $2,000 on Thursday stole the spotlight from bitcoin (BTC), which is down slightly on the day, at around $36,500, while ether is now around $2,100.According to David Lo, head of financial products at Bybit, ether could push further. “Historically, ETH often makes significant gains following a peak in Bitcoin's value, a pattern that may repeat here giving us a price target of around $2500,” said Lo. “After that, there may be a final rotation of profits into lower-cap coins before a cooling-off period, which may involve an overall 10-30% correction.”  Swiss bank UBS' wealthy clients can now take on exposure to three crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) through the lender's Hong Kong platform, according to a Bloomberg report citing a person familiar with the matter. The ETFs, Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active, CSOP Bitcoin Futures and CSOP Ether Futures ETFs, are all authorized by Hong Kong's securities regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). Together, they boast assets worth around $72 million. Significantly, the news comes a day after HSBC, one of the world's largest banks, said it plans to start a digital assets custody service for institutional clients.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows an annualized three-month basis in ether futures listed on Binance.  The basis has risen to 9.2%, the highest since at least early 2022, indicating renewed bullish sentiment in the market.  A positive basis means futures are trading at a premium to spot prices.

BlackRock Ethereum Spot ETF Confirmed American multinational investment company, BlackRock has been making waves in the crypto space after news spread of NASDAQ listing the investment firm’s Ethereum Spot ETF, iShares Ether Trust in Delaware. “BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF confirmed. They just submitted a 19b-4 filing with Nasdaq,” Bloomberg Research Analyst, Jeff Seyffart stated. Related Reading: Countdown to Chaos: Ethereum Insider To Expose ETH Founders’ Fraud In Weeks While BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF proposal remains to be approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the $9 trillion asset management company has placed its focus on Ethereum Spot ETFs while it waits for the SEC’s final decision on Spot Bitcoin ETFs. The news of the Nasdaq Ethereum ETF filing comes as a major development for BlackRock’s move into the ETF world. Although the investment company remains tight-lipped on the ETH ETF reports flowing through the space, the possibility of an Ether Spot ETF approval could be a sign of the SEC’s approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the future. Many crypto enthusiasts have predicted that the US SEC may continue its efforts to stop the growth of Spot Bitcoin ETFs by declining BlackRock’s Ether Spot ETF filing. However, in the case the regulatory body does approve the asset management company’s Ethereum Spot ETF, the SEC could be faced with potential contradictions in its decision-making processes. The acceptance of ETH Spot ETFs would stand in stark contrast to the previous disapproval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Presently, the crypto community has been largely positive, as market metrics signal a potential rally for altcoins following BlackRock’s Ethereum Spot ETF confirmation. A crypto member has stated that the asset management company’s move into Ether Spot ETFs indicates strategic confidence in securing approval for Spot Bitcoin ETF in the future. ETH Price Skyrockets Following the news of NASDAQ registering BlackRock’s Ethereum Spot ETF, the price of ETH has increased by over 9% and is currently trading at $2,086.92 according to CoinMarketCap.

42419112,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDqdZ,1699619480,Celsius Bankruptcy Reorganization Plan Approved by Court; Implementation by Early 2024,"Celsius' exit from bankruptcy, a process that started in July last year, has been approved by a New York court.  The lender's creditors had voted to approve a plan that would return as much as 85% of their holdings back to them  Customers who had funds tied up in Celsius will get back about $0.25 per CEL utility token.  Crypto lender Celsius secured approval for its reorganization plan from a bankruptcy court on Thursday, with the implementation expected to be completed by early 2024, the company said.  The order marks Celsius' exit from bankruptcy, filed in July last year, a process that also saw it make a $4.7 billion settlement with U.S. authorities over fraud allegations. At the time of settlement in July, former CEO Alex Mashinsky – who had resigned in September, 2022 – was arrested on fraud charges for allegedly manipulating the price of the lender's CEL token, an allegation he has denied. Mashinsky was released on a $40 million bond, and a court recently ordered his banking and real estate assets frozen. His trial is scheduled for September 2024.  Chief Judge Martin Glenn of the United States Southern District of New York Bankruptcy Court confirmed a modified plan that was mostly agreed upon in late September, when Celsius' creditors voted to approve a plan that would return 67%-85% of holdings back to them. Customers who had funds tied up in Celsius will be getting back about $0.25 per CEL token. CEL was a utility token and its underlying value was based on the utilities it offered on the Celsius Network.  Celsius said on Thursday it would return about $2 billion in cryptocurrency to account holders, according to a Reuters report.  The judge's order also hands control of the implementation of the reorganization to Fahrenheit Holdings, a group that includes Arrington Capital and crypto miner U.S. Bitcoin Corp. Fahrenheit won a bid to acquire the insolvent lender in May 2023. The plan will see the creation of a new company registered in Delaware, currently referred to in filings as NewCo, usually a term used to describe a corporate spinoff before it is assigned a final name. The company will focus on mining and staking.  ""NewCo will have a $1.25 billion balance sheet,"" the filing said. ""NewCo intends to stake some or all of this Liquid Cryptocurrency to earn staking yields on the Ethereum network, which would generate anywhere from $10 to $20 million per year.""  The mining business is ""getting better by the day,” with ""no debt,” ""125,000 rigs,” ""an excellent mining manager in the US Bitcoin"" and has ""significant earnings power” moving forward, under Fahrenheit’s operation, the filing said.

42419111,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDqcX,1699617975,Poloniex Hot Wallets Hacked With $114M Seemingly Stolen: On-Chain Data,"Cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex has had its hot wallets drained by hackers with an estimated loss of around $114 million, several sets of on-chain data show.  A suspected hack was flagged at around 10:55 UTC by blockchain security firms PeckShield and Cyvers. Poloniex announced 12 minutes later that the exchange's wallet had been disabled for maintenance. The hack was later confirmed by Poloniex investor Justin Sun in a tweet.  Various wallets across multiple blockchains appear to have been targeted. Arkham data shows that an Ethereum wallet, now tagged as ""Poloniex hacker,"" sent a total of $114 million worth of tokens from Poloniex in 357 transactions. A wallet on the Tron blockchain also sent around $42 million to various wallets.  Poloniex is one of the longest-running crypto exchanges, having been founded in 2013. It was acquired by Circle in 2018 and later spun off to several investors including Justin Sun, who revealed that he was a part of the most recent acquisition in 2019.  The exchange has facilitated $616 million worth of trading volume over the past 24 hours, its public reserves are not available to view, according to CoinMarketCap. That compares with $19.3 billion for market leader Binance and $3 billion for Coinbase (COIN), the only publicly traded exchange.  Crypto exchanges are common targets for hackers. Two months ago HTX was hacked with a total of $8 million worth of ether [ETH] being drained; South Korean exchange Gdac lost $13 million in April and Deribit lost $28 million in a hot-wallet hack last November.  On-chain data also show the Poloniex hacker bought $20 million worth of tron [TRX], pushing the token's price up by more than 25%.  Blockchain analytics company Nansen reported that there were just 175 tokens left in Poloniex's wallet, worth a total of $10,000.  ""We are currently investigating the Poloniex hack incident,"" Sun tweeted. ""Poloniex maintains a healthy financial position and will fully reimburse the affected funds. Additionally, we are exploring opportunities for collaboration with other exchanges to facilitate the recovery of these funds.""  Sun added that the exchange is offering a 5% white hat bounty to the hacker with a deadline of seven days before engaging with law enforcement.  Sun posted on X (formerly Twitter) later Friday that Poloniex ""successfully identified and frozen a portion of the assets associated with the hacker's addresses.""  ""At present, the losses are within manageable limits, and Poloniex's operating revenue can cover these losses,"" he added.  UPDATE (Nov. 10, 12:20 UTC): Updates amount stolen in headline, first paragraph, according to Arkham; adds Justin Sun white hat bounty offer in last paragraph.

The surge in these alternative cryptocurrencies has been propelled by Bitcoin’s climb to the $36,000 level. Despite the broader market’s positive movements, SHIB’s recent performance prompts a closer examination of its resilience and potential trajectory. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Chart Described As ‘Beautiful’ By Crypto Analyst The Shibburn website has reported a remarkable surge in the burn rate, surpassing 3,000% in the last 24 hours, resulting in the incineration of over 9 million tokens. This significant increase in token burn raises a crucial question: What could be the potential impact of this heightened burn rate on SHIB’s price dynamics? Source: Shibburn Analyzing SHIB’s Current Price Trends As of the latest update from CoinGecko, SHIB is priced at $0.00000826, reflecting a 4.3% decline in the past 24 hours. However, the token has managed to secure a 5.9% gain over the last seven days, showcasing a level of volatility that demands a more nuanced understanding of the factors influencing SHIB’s price movements. Investors keen on the Shiba Inu market are carefully scrutinizing this fluctuation, with the broader crypto market exhibiting robust rallies. While SHIB has dipped marginally in the short term, its seven-day gains suggest an underlying resilience that could be crucial in navigating the current crypto landscape. SHIB price action in the last week. Source: Coingecko Navigating A Formidable Barrier Adding to the complexity, Shiba Inu’s recent price surge has brought it to a critical juncture, approaching a significant barrier that could impede further gains. According to new data, SHIB faces a colossal 250 trillion barrier within its current trading range, spanning from $0.000008 to $0.000014. Within this range, a staggering 361,080 addresses have collectively acquired 250.23 trillion SHIB at an average price of $0.000011. SHIB market cap currently at $4.89 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Investors are closely watching this barrier, as breaking through or succumbing to it could be a pivotal moment for SHIB. The large number of addresses involved and the substantial quantity of SHIB acquired within this range underscore the significance of this price band and its potential impact on future market dynamics. Implications For Shiba Inu Investors The implications of this scenario raise concerns for Shiba Inu investors, as the token navigates both short-term fluctuations and the imposing 250 trillion SHIB barrier. The intensified burn rate, while potentially influencing the token’s scarcity, must be scrutinized against the backdrop of broader market dynamics and investor sentiment.

The financial giant is allowing clients to plug in conditions for funds to be moved to cover overdue payments or margin calls, according to an email on Friday. Previously, they had to set standing orders for payments to take place at a particular time, whereas now they can program them to kick in when the relevant criteria are met.  ""This new feature helps clients to respond dynamically to events, which is ever more important as 24x7 payment infrastructure proliferates, and responding to volatility becomes vital,"" the bank said.  JPMorgan introduced JPM Coin in 2019 to enable institutional clients to make wholesale payments on a blockchain. Last month it reached the milestone of handling $1 billion of transactions daily, though this remains a trivial figure compared with the $10 trillion the bank moves every day in total.

42419116,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDqgf,1699614041,"Was Ether's Bitcoin-Beating Surge a One-Off, or Has The Tide Really Turned?","The ETF narrative could have a bigger market impact on ether than it did on bitcoin.  Traders are pricing higher volatility in ether relative to bitcoin for the coming weeks, a key market gauge suggests.  Ether [ETH], the native token of Ethereum's smart-contract blockchain, surged 12.2% Thursday, outshining bitcoin for the first time in ages. The rally came on reports that BlackRock (BLK), the world's largest asset manager, wants to create an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that purchases ETH and saw the ether-bitcoin ratio rise by 9% from 17-month lows.  Activity in the options market suggests ether's outperformance is more than a one-off event and could continue over the near term.  The spread between Deribit's forward-looking 30-day implied volatility indices for ether (ETH DVOL) and bitcoin (BTC DVOL) has turned positive in the past 24 hours, reaching a high of 5.9%, the highest since April, according to Amberdata. Implied volatility refers to investors' expectations for price turbulence over a specific period.  The positive turnaround indicates traders expect more action in ether over the next four weeks. Perhaps optimism about an eventual launch of a spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. has been priced in, and the focus is now on ether.  ""The market has been chasing BTC for the last month, but it looks like the spot BTC ETF launch is now very close to being priced in,"" said Jeff Anderson, a senior trader at STS Digital. ""ETH was left behind in October, but the [BlackRock] filing yesterday reminded everyone that a similar product is not far behind.""  ""The rotation out of BTC into ETH (during alt season was attractive), and so the market chased it and caught people short options, so [ETH IV] ripped higher,"" Anderson added. As such, people look to be chasing ether now that it shows signs of life.  Bitcoin has surged over 35% since early October, mainly on expectations that a potential spot ETF could bring a $100 billion or more in inflows over five years.  Similar inflows could have a bigger impact on ether, whose market capitalization of $252.41 billion is just 1/3 of bitcoin's $713.10 billion.  ""ETH has a relatively minor market cap than BTC, which means that when the same size of liquidity flows into ETH, the price of ETH will be pushed higher, and the volatility will be greater,"" Griffin Ardnern, a volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/10/was-ethers-bitcoin-beating-surge-a-one-off-or-has-the-tide-really-turned,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5027369eb961ce090a279ded1b8c3bba5212d5c5-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

That is an 88% gain from current prices of $36,500.  “Bitcoin uptrends tend to move quickly once they get going, moving hundreds of percent often in less than a year,” shared Cory Mitchell, an analyst with Trading.biz, in a Friday note to CoinDesk. “This is called the acceleration phase.’  According to Mitchell, ""really big gains"" happen a year and a half after the bottom, meaning the near-90 degree price surge could resume sometime around mid-2024. The cryptocurrency bottomed out in November last year.  ""In 2013, bitcoin rallied 1200% in approximately 100 days; in 2017, it rallied 1900% in just under a year; in late 2020, it rallied 400% in about 140 days,” Mitchell said, warning of several pullbacks and price dumps on the way to a retake of highs.  Over the past year, the world’s largest asset by market capitalization has seemingly shaken fears stemming from multiple bankruptcies of prominent players in the industry and a generally bearish economic environment by gaining almost 116%.  Recent bullish sentiment has been largely buoyed by spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) filings in the U.S., bumping expectations that regulated offerings could open the gates to widespread institutional demand.  Demand and usage for regulated instruments have grown in tandem with prices. On Thursday, bitcoin futures trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) registered the highest volumes worldwide, toppling those of industry leader Binance.  Open interest, or the amount of unsettled futures, stood at roughly $4.07 billion, up some 4% in the past 24 hours and representing a 24.7% market share. In contrast, open interest on Binance stood at $3.8 billion, down 7.8% during the same period.  Market observers told CoinDesk they considered the rise as indicative of institutional demand for bitcoin products.  ""Given the CME is a venue used almost exclusively by large traditional financial institutions, it shows how much interest there has been from this audience in crypto,"" David Lawant, head of research at trading platform FalconX, told CoinDesk in a Thursday note.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/10/bitcoin-could-hit-69k-by-mid-2024-as-it-enters-acceleration-phase-analyst-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6e97a751a652645db0ed4ca7165719b161a61bb5-2464x1386.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The report highlights a mix of micro and macro events anticipated to positively impact the industry, with a particular focus on Bitcoin. Top 6 Predictions For Bitcoin And Crypto First, the report underlines the anticipation of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving a Bitcoin ETF. Notably, the company believes that the approval of the first spot ETFs will take a few more weeks. Matrixport stated, “By January 2024, we anticipate the SEC to approve a Bitcoin ETF, with trading expected to commence by February or March.” This event is viewed as a massive catalyst for increased institutional investment in Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Gear Up: 200-Day SMA Rise And Historical Trend Signal $50,000 Price Target Further, Matrixport points to the potential listing of stablecoin issuer Circle on the stock market by April 2024. This event is seen as a significant step towards mainstream acceptance of digital assets. According to a Bitcoinist report, Circle, the company behind the stablecoin USDC, is contemplating an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in early 2024. Currently, the company is engaging with consultants to lay the groundwork for this potential public listing, though it remains uncertain whether the IPO will ultimately materialize. The third prediction of Matrixport concerns FTX, “While the announcement of FTX’s winning bid could occur in December 2023, we project the exchange to be operational by May or June 2024,” the report forecasts. FTX is anticipated to reclaim its position as a top 3 exchange within 12 months, making a strong comeback in the crypto exchange landscape. Also, the report mentions the interplay of these three events with the Bitcoin halving cycle, suggesting a synergistic effect that could provide momentum into the following year. The halving is expected to take place at the end of April 2024 and could be the most impactful halving of all time. Bitcoin will become the hardest asset in the world as BTC’s inflation rate will fall to half that of gold. Ethereum And Macro Predictions As a fifth prediction, Matrixport sees Ethereum’s EIP-4844 upgrade, scheduled for Q1 2024, as a less significant, yet noteworthy event. The report states, “Although seeing this as a significant upside catalyst is challenging, in Q1 2024, Ethereum’s IEP-4844 upgrade is scheduled to take place.” Related Reading: A Chat With Paolo Ardoino: What’s Behind The Bitcoin Price Rally, New Role As CEO, And Adoption Furthermore, the potential US Federal Reserve interest rate cut by mid-2024 is mentioned as a macro event that could have a significant impact on the crypto market. “This [Ethereum’s upgrade] also coincides with the potential US Federal Reserve interest rate cut by mid-2024, as market pricing indicates the first rate cut happening in June 2024,” the report elaborates. The report concludes with an analysis of the short-term Bitcoin price movement. It notes, “Next week’s US CPI data could trigger another rally in Bitcoin if inflation declines again.” The report forecasts Bitcoin attempting to break out, with a potential to reach up to $45,000 by the end of 2023, catalyzed by a ‘Santa Claus rally’. At press time, BTC traded at $36,657.

Bitcoin holdings at the company founded by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, who often tweets his support for the largest cryptocurrency, reached $5.7 billion late on Thursday as the price crossed $37,000 for the first time since May 2022.  The company holds over 158,000 bitcoins, a position it acquired over a three-year period by investing company funds and proceeds from bond sales. The value of the holdings is now equal to over 80% of MicroStrategy’s $7.1 billion stock market capitalization.  The cost for these holdings is a cumulative $4.6 billion, data from Bitcoin Treasuries show. That's more than 10 times larger than the next biggest institutional holder, bitcoin miner Marathon Digital, which has 13,000 bitcoins worth $500 million at current prices.  MicroStrategy’s most recent publicly known purchases came in the weeks ahead of Sept. 24, when it added 5,445 bitcoins for just under $150 million, or an average price of $27,053 each.  Bitcoin has surged recently amid optimism U.S. regulators will approve exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold BTC, a move some experts believe will prompt a flood of investment into the foremost cryptocurrency.  Those expectations increased Wednesday following a CoinDesk report that the Securities and Exchange Commission has opened talks with Grayscale Investments on the details of the company's application to convert its bitcoin trust, known as GBTC, into a bitcoin ETF.

Using historical data, she elaborated on why an IPO isn’t as straightforward and profitable as some might think. Why Investors Should Be Cautious In a post shared on her X (formerly Twitter) platform, Crypto Eri revealed how investors aren’t excited about IPOs in what sounded like a note of warning to those who are ready to go all in if Ripple were to go public. Related Reading: Countdown to Chaos: Ethereum Insider To Expose ETH Founders’ Fraud In Weeks The reason for investors’ lack of enthusiasm seems to be that the biggest IPOs of 2021 have shed 60% of their value since going public. According to her, this fact has also made other private entities cautious to hold off on their plans to go public. She highlighted certain “essential components” that investors should insist on when listening to anyone talk about price analysis and a company’s valuation.

While Eri seems to be more cautious about a potential Ripple IPO, some others have taken a more bullish stance and are ready to go all in on it. One of them happens to be pro-XRP Wall Street financial analyst Linda Jones, who had predicted that a Ripple stock could be valued as high as $600. She also touted XRP as the next big thing in the financial market as she likened the crypto token to Microsoft and Apple’s stocks. Maybe Not The Right Time For A Ripple IPO Eri’s warning also seemed to be directed at Ripple as she highlighted key points that might make the crypto company reconsider if an IPO was already in the works. She drew comparisons between Ripple and other similar types of companies, as the former could take a cue from some of their actions. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Bitcoin And Crypto Market Crash Of Epic Proportions, Here’s When Interestingly, one of them happens to be Ripple’s partner, Nium Global, which she noted was holding off its US IPO to “possibly the second quarter of 2025.” She alluded to the fact that this decision was made despite the fact that Nium Global is doing pretty well and even recently launched a liquidity hub for FX. The XRP community might, however, not have to worry about how Ripple will fare if it goes public now, as there is evidence to suggest that the company doesn’t plan on doing so anytime soon. The founder of Dizer Capital, Yassin Mobarak, recently revealed that Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse mentioned that a Ripple IPO wasn’t feasible until the company’s legal battle with the SEC is over.

Today, the coin experienced a noteworthy surge, witnessing a price increase of $0.000001417 in 24-hour trading, marking an impressive 21% rally. Source: Coingecko Highlighting PEPE’s Potential The sudden surge in PEPE’s value has sparked interest and speculation within the crypto community. One possible catalyst for this upward movement is the revelation of PEPE’s undervaluation index.

The undervaluation index serves as a metric to assess whether an asset is trading at a price that accurately reflects its true value. In the case of PEPE, with an undervaluation index of 4.2, the coin appears to be trading below its potential value, hinting at the possibility of a forthcoming price uptick. Significance Of Whale Movement Adding to the intrigue surrounding PEPE’s resurgence, Lookonchain, a blockchain analytics platform, drew attention to a notable development in the market. According to their post, a whale — a large investor with significant holdings — has initiated the accumulation of PEPE. What did the whale buy recently? The whale with 10,080 $ETH($19.4M) spent 1,433 $ETH($2.6M) to buy 2.51M $ARB at $1.045 and 1,038 $ETH ($1.9M) to buy 1.65T $PEPE at $0.000001154. The whale is currently making $177K(+7%) on $ARB and $159K(+8%) on $PEPE.https://t.co/9Btmdst56T pic.twitter.com/EwsXjIFGdz — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 9, 2023 The movement of whales in the crypto market often carries significance, influencing trends and prices. The accumulation of PEPE by a whale suggests confidence in the coin’s potential and could further contribute to its upward trajectory. PEPE’s Rollercoaster Ride And Future Prospects As PEPE experiences this rollercoaster ride in its price dynamics, crypto enthusiasts and investors are closely monitoring the developments. The recent surge, driven by undervaluation and whale accumulation, raises questions about the sustainability of PEPE’s upward momentum. Total crypto market cap currently at $1.3 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com Analysts are likely to delve into the underlying factors influencing the coin’s value, exploring whether this resurgence is a short-term spike or indicative of a more substantial trend. The crypto community awaits further developments and market signals to gauge PEPE’s future prospects in this ever-evolving landscape.

20005946,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560032,1699603535,"Solana Price Could Reach $1,000, Analyst Explains Why","Crypto analyst Jacob Canfield has laid out a comprehensive analysis, suggesting Solana (SOL) could be on the brink of an unprecedented market surge. “In my opinion, I think that Solana is going to continue to be one of the biggest movers during this current bull market cycle,” Canfield states, proposing that Solana could potentially escalate its market dominance to the 12-15% range. Can Solana Hit $1,000? Canfield bases his analysis on several indicators. He highlights the Solana Dominance (SOL.D) chart, noting that at the peak market cap, it didn’t even crack 3%. Given the current trends and the breakout of SOLBTC from its weekly resistance, Canfield envisions a scenario where Solana could enter a parabolic rally phase, which is further supported by the SOLETH chart showing a similar pattern. “SOLETH – Also currently broke out of a weekly resistance and looks to be forming a parabolic rally against it.” A significant factor in Canfield’s analysis is the current state of Ethereum Dominance (ETH.D). He notes that ETH.D is breaking down from a long-term trendline and losing the 200 weekly moving average, now sitting at 17%. “If Solana continues to trend against Ethereum and it continues to break down to 2019-2020 levels, we could see SOL as the big winner this cycle,” Canfield explains. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Continues To Register Notable Gains Daily, Is $50 the Target? However, Canfield does not disregard the potential ramifications of recent news regarding an Ethereum ETF. “This may not play out with the current ETF announcement news as it will bring more attention,” he acknowledges, indicating that an approved Ethereum ETF could shift investor focus and capital back to Ethereum, potentially tempering Solana’s ascent. Despite potential headwinds from the Ethereum sector, Canfield emphasizes Solana’s robust partnerships with corporate giants like Google, Circle, and Amazon, positing that these collaborations could significantly drive adoption and enhance Solana’s visibility in this cycle of the crypto market. Furthermore, Canfield’s analysis extends beyond charts and partnerships. He delves into the Solana ecosystem, spotlighting projects that are paving the way for its expansion. From decentralized finance protocols and automated market makers to NFT storage solutions and governance tokens for gaming platforms, Canfield points to a breadth of innovation within Solana that parallels, and in some aspects, seeks to outdo Ethereum’s ecosystem. In light of the FTX debacle, Canfield remarks on the psychological impact on Solana’s market sentiment, noting that with Sam Bankman-Fried’s legal troubles, there is an opportunity for Solana to redefine itself. “There’s a bit of PTSD around the ecosystem, but it’s time to become its own entity and forge its own future,” he asserts, suggesting that Solana’s future will be shaped by those who are deeply integrated into its ecosystem, from developers to traders and influencers. Related Reading: Solana Whale Deposits $11M In SOL To Binance, Bearish Signal? His conclusion: “Solana could triple or quadruple it’s all time high market dominance around 12-15% and if it continues to trend against Bitcoin, could easily see a $1,000 per coin and take the #2 spot behind Bitcoin.” When asked about the potential of Ethereum, Canfield emphasized, “No reason to not have allocations to both. It’s like trying to bet on Microsoft or Google. Tesla or Ford: Just buy both.” Short-Term SOL Price Outlook On the shorter-term horizon, analyst Rekt Capital brings attention to Solana’s price movements in a recent post on X. “Solana continues to outperform in the market. In 2021, SOL upside deviated to $53 and then $61 before retracing to the bottom of the purple box,” he noted, referring to a specific zone on the price chart that has historically acted as both resistance and support. In the Rekt Capital chart, SOL is currently breaking out above the zone. However, if history repeats itself and the zone once again acts as strong resistance, the SOL price could suffer a severe pullback. Using the green arrow in the chart, Rekt Capital paints a scenario in which SOL initially falls back towards $30 before the price rises again towards $42.

42392096,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg0Q35,1699603005,Ethereum Fees Briefly Jumped to $100 After BlackRock’s ETH ETF Filing,"Heightened demand for block space on the Ethereum network has made transactional activity significantly more expensive for ether [ETH] users in the past 24 hours, data from Dune Analytics show.  Fees, as measured by median gas prices, spiked to as high as 270 gwei late on Thursday, temporarily touching a level last seen in June 2022. That pushed up costs of trading swaps to anywhere from $60 to $100 for a few hours. Gwei is a small unit of ether (ETH) equal to one-billionth of an ETH and is used to denominate gas prices. Gas refers to the fees Ethereum users pay to ensure their transactions are included in the earliest block by network validators.  As of writing, gas fees, used to pay for any activity on Ethereum, were 33 gwei, the highest since May. Ether transfers between wallets cost an average of $30 as of Asian morning hours on Friday.  The surge in fees came as investors discovered financial behemoth BlackRock had filed for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that holds ether (ETH), months after its bitcoin ETF filing. This likely buoyed investor sentiment – as prices jumped as much as 10% to cross the $2,000 mark.  Ethereum validators are incentivized to include transactions that pay the highest fees instead of a first-come-first-serve basis – meaning fees on popular tokens can often run to thousands of dollars.  Nansen data suggests that on-chain activity has remained tepid relative to a more bullish period in 2022 – indicating retail audiences have been largely absent from on-chain trading.  “There is no inclination of on-chain activity increasing alongside it in terms of DAUs and newly funded addresses entering the Ethereum ecosystem,” Nansen analyst Jake Kennis shared in a Thursday message.  “This suggests that on-chain activity may be lagging price action here or that we are not seeing the on-chain follow-through that is normally seen with this type of increased market activity as of yet,"" Kennis added.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/11/10/ethereum-fees-briefly-jumped-to-100-after-blackrocks-eth-etf-filing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fced705ec0df66609cdaf9a20db5a2e2e0c1941f-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The three crypto ETFs, Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active, CSOP Bitcoin Futures and CSOP Ether Futures ETFs, are all authorized by Hong Kong's securities regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). Together, the three products boast assets worth around $72 million.  Significantly, the news comes a day after HSBC, one of the world's largest banks, said it plans to start a digital assets custody service for institutional clients.  In the past few days, Hong Kong has moved towards allowing retail investors to buy spot crypto Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and primary dealing of tokenization. The move appears to be another step in Hong Kong's recently accelerated ambitions to become a virtual asset hub. It implemented a new regulatory regime in June, accepting applications for crypto trading platform licenses, and granted the first set in August, allowing exchanges to serve retail customers.  UBS and the SFC did not immediately respond to a CoinDesk request for comment.  Recently, UBS was named as one of six commercial banks working with the Swiss National Bank (SNB) on a wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot.  Earlier this year, in March, UBS stepped in to save Credit Suisse after the latter collapsed. Shortly after bitcoin climbed above $28,000.

42392092,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg0Psp,1699593979,Bitcoin ETF Excitement Drives Wall Street Giant CME Above Binance in BTC Futures Rankings,"CME Group just took the top spot on the list of world's biggest bitcoin [BTC] futures exchanges, replacing Binance for the first time in two years.  Open interest – derivatives industry jargon for the number of existing contracts – on Thursday hit $4.07 billion worth of positions at CME, representing a 24.7% share of the entire bitcoin futures market, CoinGlass data shows. Binance was at $3.8 billion.  CME is a stalwart of traditional finance, a Chicago-based firm whose business covers a wide span of financial, commodity and agricultural futures and options. The timing of it overtaking Binance, a crypto-focused exchange, is poignant. Wall Street firms like BlackRock are increasingly steering the narrative around bitcoin and the rest of crypto, by trying, for instance, to introduce bitcoin and ether [ETH] ETFs in an attempt to open up crypto investing to a broader group of people. Such financial heavyweights are accustomed to doing business on a highly regulated exchange like CME, as opposed to Binance, which has run into trouble with U.S. regulators.  ""As market participants seek regulated venues and highly liquid products to hedge market volatility and manage price exposure, we continue to see increased institutional interest across our crypto suite,"" said Tim McCourt, global head of financial and OTC products at CME Group. ""Market participants view CME Group as a valued source for risk management.""  The change in rankings occurred as the crypto market endured a major leverage flush-out amid wild price swings on Thursday. The aggregate bitcoin open interest dropped by $2 billion from $12 billion. The decline impacted Binance traders disproportionately more than CME market participants.  Bitcoin first surged to an 18-month high of almost $38,000 on Thursday, then sharply retraced toward $36,000 after a filing showed a corporate entity named ""iShares Ethereum Trust"" had been registered in the state of Delaware. A similar move happened before BlackRock – the owner of iShares – filed for a spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) in June.  CME's rise to the top happened gradually this year and is a significant development as it highlights the growing demand from institutional market participants to trade the largest and oldest crypto asset. A paper published by Bitwise Asset Management in 2020 said that the CME bitcoin futures market leads the spot market in a consistent and statistically significant manner.  ""The CME has been gaining market share for almost all of 2023, but these gains intensified over the past few weeks as market excitement around the BTC spot ETF applications soared,"" David Lawant, head of research at trading platform FalconX, told CoinDesk in a note.  ""Given the CME is a venue used almost exclusively by large traditional financial institutions, it shows how much interest there has been from this audience in crypto,"" Lawant added.  Binance didn't respond to a request for comment, though CEO Changpeng Zhao posted a screenshot of this article on X (formerly Twitter) and wrote: ""U.S. institutions are moving into crypto. What about your country?""

After a brief consolidation phase, the leading cryptocurrency has regained its bullish momentum, soaring to a peak of $38,000 before retracing to its current trading level of $36,400. As the market eagerly awaits the next move, experts and analysts weigh in on Bitcoin’s potential to sustain its upward trajectory. BTC’s Golden Cross Signals Potential Surge To $50,000 The Birb Nest team provides valuable insights into the short-term scenarios for Bitcoin. From a fundamental perspective, the anticipation of ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) and the upcoming halving event contribute to the current drive and support the bullish sentiment in the market. Moreover, from a technical standpoint, Bitcoin’s recent breakthrough of $32,000 has its sights set on the key psychological level of $40,000, bolstered by the presence of the Golden Cross and a rising 200-day simple moving average (SMA). Related Reading: A Chat With Paolo Ardoino: What’s Behind The Bitcoin Price Rally, New Role As CEO, And Adoption The Golden Cross, a bullish technical pattern formed when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average, has played a significant role in Bitcoin’s recent surge. Combined with the rising 200-day SMA, which indicates a strengthening long-term trend, these indicators reinforce the ongoing uptrend and provide a strong foundation for Bitcoin’s potential upward movement. According to the Birb Nest team’s analysis, Bitcoin’s price action suggests an imminent increase in volatility, as indicated by the bullish Fear & Greed Index registering at 68. After experiencing a 27% jump in October, surpassing the historical average, November historically exhibits robust gains of over 40%, potentially propelling Bitcoin toward $50,000. Notably, the second half of the month tends to be more bullish, heightening the anticipation for further price appreciation. Expert Identifies Pivotal Resistance For Bitcoin According to a recent post on X (formerly Twitter) by the crypto expert Michael Van De Poppe, $38,000 to $40,000 represents a critical resistance zone for Bitcoin. This means that price levels within this range will likely face significant selling pressure and challenge Bitcoin’s upward momentum. Van De Poppe warns against expecting an immediate breakout above this resistance level, suggesting that consolidation beneath it is a more probable scenario. Van De Poppe emphasizes the importance of consolidation beneath the resistance zone. Van De Poppe suggests that such consolidation provides a healthy base for Bitcoin’s price to gather strength before attempting a breakthrough. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Cracks Above $2,000 As BlackRock Eyes ETH ETF By stabilizing within this range, Bitcoin builds a stronger foundation to support a potential bullish move in the future. Regardless of the forecast, the cryptocurrency’s upcoming price action remains to be seen if it will be accompanied by consolidation and a subsequent breakout or if Bitcoin is inclined to test lower support levels before embarking on another bullish move.

Pseudonymous analyst Kaleo’s recent remarks on the promising trajectory of the meme coin have ignited a sense of anticipation within the crypto community. Kaleo’s assertion that Dogecoin – calling its USD price chart “beautiful” – could soon experience a surge akin to other thriving altcoins in the market has brought renewed attention to the coin’s potential for substantial growth.

This projection has prompted fervent discussions and debates among investors, with many eagerly awaiting the speculated breakthrough. $DOGE Honestly though – look at how beautiful the USD chart is.

19993610,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559997,1699574410,Polygon (MATIC) Flying: Is This Program The Primary Catalyst?,"MATIC, the native token of Polygon, an Ethereum sidechain, is ripping higher, mirroring the general performance across the crypto scene, spearheaded by Bitcoin (BTC). As of November 9, MATIC is up roughly 5% in the past 24 hours and inching closer to July 23 highs, looking at the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart. This upswing is at the back of rising trading volume and improving sentiment, which has seen the token expand 64% from October lows, a net positive for optimistic traders. The 110 Million MATIC Grant Looking at events in the past few trading days, the MATIC rally seems to have been catalyzed by Polygon Village’s recent announcement. The team said it plans to distribute 110 million MATIC to projects aiming to deploy decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and social media solutions on the sidechain. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Cracks Above $2,000 As BlackRock Eyes ETH ETF Polygon said late-stage projects can receive direct grants of up to 2 million MATIC. Meanwhile, early-stage projects and startups, can apply via quadratic funding grants. In this funding arrangement, the amount of MATIC sent to a project will directly depend on how popular the project is. Those that are popular among crypto holders will receive more funds. Still, it remains unclear how Polygon Labs will deal with bots when deciding how popular a given project is. Voting will be on-chain on Polygon, where MATIC will be the currency through which users can support their favorite projects. Polygon Rising Stature: From POL To ZK-EVM Over the years, Polygon has emerged as a popular scaling solution for Ethereum, looking at statistics and total value locked (TVL), especially in DeFi. The platform is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Accordingly, it allows protocols launching on its rails to easily connect with the mainnet without sacrificing security. By connecting with Polygon, projects can operate in a highly scalable environment with relatively low fees. This feature allows intensive dapps, including social media platforms or decentralized exchanges (DEXes), to operate seamlessly. Polygon is also transitioning and, subject to the community’s approval, will gradually replace MATIC with POL. This token will power the broader ecosystem, including supernets and layer-2 networks relaying on Polygon’s infrastructure. In late October, the POL contracts went live on the Ethereum mainnet as part of Polygon 2.0. This transition will see Polygon integrate zero-knowledge (ZK) technology into all its products.
