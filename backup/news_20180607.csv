42380818,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zUT7,1528404701,Putin: Russia Should Explore Blockchain to Avoid Finance 'Limitations',"The Russian government has taken a cautious approach to cryptocurrencies, president Vladimir Putin said during an annual ""hotline"" on Thursday.  Asked if Russia will have its own cryptocurrency one day, Putin said he doesn't see such an outcome as possible because cryptocurrencies ""by definition are beyond the national borders.""  While expressing that caution, he nonetheless admitted that cryptocurrencies are ""developing in the world"" and that Russia should explore the opportunities around the tech. Among the possible uses, he said, was to ""avoid various limitations in global finance trade"" – a suggestion that blockchain could help ease sanctions against Russian banks, companies and individuals imposed in recent years.  Putin also noted during the four-hour annual session that cryptocurrency mining – the energy-intensive process by which new transactions are added to a blockchain, with new coins being ""minted"" in the process – is not regulated, and similarly, cryptocurrencies are not recognized as legal tender within Russia.  The Russian president notably issued a series of mandates last year to Russian officials, calling for regulations around cryptocurrencies, including the country's domestic mining sector.  ""Somewhere in Japan they are using it, but it doesn't work in other countries,"" Putin remarked on Thursday.  Legislative slow-walk  His comments come as Russia's legislature slowly weighs several measures related to the technology – something that Putin himself has expressed support for in the past.  Three bills regarding blockchain and crypto have been introduced in the Russian parliament, the State Duma, to date. Two of them passed the first round of hearings on May 22 (three rounds are required to pass the bill), one of them named ""On the digital financial assets"" and the other ""On the digital rights"".  Both bills aim to introduce basic blockchain terminology to the Russian legal language, such as tokens and blockchain. They also restrict cashing out of tokens to authorized finance institutions and assign the Bank of Russia as a regulator that should control the crypto trade and ICOs in the country.  One more bill, ""On the distributed national mining"" – which introduces the term ""cryptoruble"" – was rejected by legislators.  Michael Komin, an expert for the institutions development with the Center for Strategic Development – a Moscow think tank chaired by Alexei Kudrin, a former head of the Department of Finance and one of the proponents of blockchain technology in Russian establishment–- believes that the bills are ""half-empty"" because an adequate legal language for blockchain hasn't been created so far.  ""The only thing the parliament can do is to ban the technology as such, but it won't be approved by the Bank of Russia, Department of Finance and Treasury, which are already using elements of blockchain, and by the President Putin's advisor Andrei Belousov, "" Komin said.  He expects the current blockchain bills to get ""left without movement until better times and finally perish under the piles of other bills.""

42380811,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zUO5,1528399555,NYDFS Chief Defends State Regulator's Crypto Approach,"New York Department of Financial Services superintendent Maria Vullo defended her office's approach to regulating cryptocurrencies on Thursday.  Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relation's ""Legal Tender? The Regulation of Cryptocurrencies"" panel in New York on Wednesday, Vullo said that her view is ""regulation in this space, just like any space where you have money transmission, [is necessary],"" making a point she often revisited during the discussion.  While some state and federal regulars are taking time to create rules for the industry, ""it certainly hasn't taken New York long to establish a framework"" for regulating cryptocurrencies, Vullo said in her opening statement, referring to the state's controversial BitLicense.  The role of regulation in the cryptocurrency space was a contentious topic, with Blockchain president and chief legal officer Marco Santori claiming regulators should ease up on the over-regulation.  That said, he did acknowledge that ""a lot of token sales run afoul of the spirit of the law, if not the letter of the law. But we have to be careful not to lump them all together.""  In particular, he argued that New York's laws ""have been an abject failure.""  However, Vullo derided developers who claim that their work should allow them to launch token sales free of disclosure or other requirements, saying:  ""I think regulators absolutely need to be in the space, I know they're saying 'we're innovative, we're startups, we need to be left alone and put in a sandbox.' Toddlers play in the sandbox. Adults play by the rules.""  In another rapid exchange, CNN investigative journalist and panelist Jose Pagliery expressed concern about the idea that ""code is law,"" saying that while this may be true, coders can modify certain protocols:  ""If you're the executive at a bank, you have people to answer to … if you're one of a dozen coders around the world whose name no one knows and you're the one at the controls changing how this cryptocurrency works … we have to figure out how these people are held accountable.""  Santori disagreed with this premise, saying ""that is not only a bad question, you should feel bad for asking it.""  In turn, Vullo said: ""I didn't know this was about feelings.""

Retired basketball star Dennis Rodman might be headed to Singapore for the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un – and he might have potcoin's help to do it.  Rodman – who has promoted the marijuana-themed cryptocurrency in the past – is reportedly mulling a visit to Singapore, according to his representatives. Having visited North Korea several times (though not without controversy), Rodman's possible trip would present a celebrity twist to what is shaping up to a be a major geopolitical event this month.  According to the Washington Post, Rodman is ""in discussions with"" the Canada-based startup behind potcoin to get backing for the trip. Potcoin spokesperson Shawn Perez told the newspaper that Rodman is on a ""peace mission.""  Perez went on to tell the Post:  ""The potcoin team as a community has been incredibly supportive of Rodman's peace mission from the beginning. We're thrilled to see how the political climate has improved between North Korea and the U.S. since he became involved.""  According to the report, Rodman's agent, Chris Volo, said details of the trip were still being worked out. Perez similarly did not provide any specifics as to the trip.  It is unclear whether Rodman will attend the summit itself or only be in Singapore during the event. The Washington Post reported that the U.S. State Department noted that Rodman is ""not a representative of the U.S. government.""

42380780,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zS5v,1528387162,'Dungeon Defenders' Game Maker to Integrate Blockchain In Sequel,"Video game publisher Trendy Entertainment is partnering with startup Signal Zero to integrate a blockchain-based rewards system with its flagship Dungeon Defenders franchise.  Trendy, best known for creating the popular Dungeon Defenders series, will base the entire rewards and ranking system for the game's sequel on a blockchain, said chief business development officer Drew Curby. He explained that the company was looking for a way to monetize Dungeon Defenders II – which is free-to-play – while still ensuring the game is fair to players.  Using a series of smart contracts to automatically generate rewards for players is how Trendy might create such a system, he told CoinDesk. To that end, Dungeon Defenders II will utilize the Loot blockchain, currently under development by Signal Zero.  Whereas another blockchain might require central or graphic processing units (CPUs/GPUs) to execute a proof-of-work algorithm, Signal Zero chief executive and founder Tobias Batton said players' game systems would handle Loot's version of PoW.  ""With our protocol, the work being done is actually the players playing video games,"" said Batton. ""We have a mathematical model to measure the player's skill.""  He went on to explain:  ""The way it would actually work is the developer like Trendy would open a node on the network, so they would actually run the node. Because they own the software, every machine would act like an oracle to the central node.""  He referred to the system as ""proof-of-activity,"" saying that gamers would receive new tokens based on both their skill level and their rank in any particular event.  Token economy  While Dungeon Defenders II will be the first game to utilize Loot, Batton does not believe it will be the last. As envisioned, the system will ultimately enable players to earn tokens in one game but redeem them in another – or even purchase rewards independent of any game.  ""That's actually a functionality we intend to release with early next year,"" he said. ""Signal Zero has a rewards exchange already and it has rewards for Amazon or Steam or Xbox, and it has a few cryptocurrencies so gamers can trade the [tokens] they own for these.""  As part of this effort, the Loot protocol will one day be compatible with ERC-20 tokens, Batton said.  While Trendy is looking to integrate Loot with Dungeon Defenders II right now, Curby said his team has not yet fully established how it will work within the game, given the early development stage.  ""We expect in the coming months to work closely with [Signal Zero], the design team, to work on a series of potential implementations to see … what makes the most sense,"" he said.

The announcement, released by the Financial Services Agency (FSA) on Thursday, confirms a report yesterday that indicated the regulator would move to reject FSHO's application – its first such refusal – after it sent two suspension orders to the firm in March and April, respectively.  The denial order further explained that the FSA's decision was made on the basis that the exchange has made no progress during the past three-month suspension period in terms of improving its internal operations.  FSHO's operation was halted as the regulator found its know-your-customer (KYC) and security measures were lacking and after the FSA launched an on-site inspection over domestic exchanges following the $500 million Coincheck hack in January.  However, the FSA alleged in today's notice that a large part of the issue stems from FSHO's unwillingness to cooperate with government officials.  The FSA claimed that it authorized delegated auditors and lawyers to form a new management team for the company on May 6, a move that came after the second suspension order on April 6.  However, the FSA indicated for issues that are ""extremely important in terms of management,"" the former management team would still move ahead without obtaining the consent of the newly appointed delegates. In effect, the regulator said the former management had still been in control.  Further, the FSA explained the company's former management also hosted a general shareholder meeting on June 4 where it decided that the formation of the new management team on May 6 was invalid, while the new team was ""virtually absent.""

42380786,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zSEj,1528372838,FOAM and the Dream to Map the World on Ethereum,"Even Pokemon Go might need a blockchain.  While an augmented reality mobile app used to collect funny-looking, digital critters might sound like a silly (or useless) service to re-architect with blockchain, the developers at ethereum startup FOAM make a compelling case.  ""The problem is that people lie about their location,"" said Ryan John King, the co-founder and CEO of FOAM. Using a range of tutorials across the web, a tech-savvy Pokemon Go player could easily trick the game into thinking they're in Hong Kong, catching all the unique Pokemon there when really they're sitting in their apartment in Brooklyn, New York, he said.  That'll be news to many since most people use GPS (the Global Positioning System) flawlessly on a daily basis.  King told CoinDesk:  ""People think location is a solved problem.""  But it goes beyond the fact that shrewd Pokemon Go users could manipulate the system; King believes today's GPS system, in its centralized form provided by the U.S. government, is insecure and prone to failure.  As such, FOAM developers want to build a technology that mirrors GPS but is instead an open technology that anyone can contribute to. And to do this, the team needs a particularly resilient map of the entire world, which they plan to devise with the help of ethereum smart contracts.  During Ethereal, an artsy ethereum conference in New York City in May, the FOAM team demoed their beta product, Spatial Index, which the website calls ""a cross between a Bloomberg trading terminal and Google Maps."" The map shows all the locations of radio beacons deployed by users, which are represented as smart contracts on the Rinkeby testnet, a copy of the ethereum blockchain used for testing purposes.  And with that, FOAM then has joined the likes of Golem and Augur as a project arousing excitement in the community for its unique use of the ethereum blockchain.  Coinbase engineer Jacob Horne is so enthusiastic he called the FOAM product ""the base layer for entire new economies."" And ConsenSys developer Simon de la Rouviere said that re-reading the whitepaper ""just blows my mind again.""  Games and beyond  The secret behind FOAM's work is the company's ""proof of location,"" a cryptographic method for proving that a user has actually been at a certain location.  This technique will be used to build a secure location-based collection game, something that mixes the gameplay of Pokemon Go with that of CryptoKitties, the popular ethereum-based application for buying, trading and breeding digital cats – and where no one can cheat.  Speaking to this, King said, ""We need something open source and horizontal and for anyone to plug into. With FOAM, you can build an app where you unlock a CryptoKitty only when you visit a particular location.""  And this idea is tantalizing to many, including Matt Condon, lead maintainer of ethereum library OpenZeppelin, who tweeted:  ""I'm so, so excited for tokenized assets plus a proof-of-location protocol like FOAM. The real Pokemon Go will be possible.""  And while FOAM is starting with games, the team thinks the technology has potential far beyond this use case.  For instance, King believes the technology could be beneficial for supply chain management as well. Whether for food or jewelry, developers and entrepreneurs are looking to disrupt the global system of tracking consumer goods throughout its life cycle with blockchains.  As such, FOAM has begun working with ethereum-based supply chain startup, Viant, which recently demoed its product in tracking tuna from the waters of Fiji to the plates of Ethereal conference goers.  Technology and tokens  So how will all this work in practice? With low power wide area networks (LPWAN), a new type of emerging network used in many internet-of-things devices.  LPWAN technology, which costs between $10 and $30, allows anyone to contribute to FOAM's map, beaming location information to the ethereum blockchain. And a significant number of people have already begun participating, although it's far from covering the whole world just yet. But the Spatial Index beta does show that the idea works in practice.  ""Deploying a LPWAN, just like a blockchain, is permissionless,"" the FOAM blog post explaining the Spatial Index says.  Still, decentralizing location data has been on the minds of many for some time.  As such, FOAM believes its key differentiator will be its crypto token – to be released through a token sale later this summer. To King, the token will incentivize people to deploy LPWAN and contribute location data to its service, moving existing location protocols, which have not succeeded in attracting many users, forward.  According to FOAM co-founder and CTO Kristoffer Josefsson, though, the product is still quite far from the team's grand vision. So far, the platform is up and running on the ethereum testnet, and the team is stress-testing the radio technology in an effort to come up with the final specification.  Once that's done, they'll run the token sale, and then push FOAM to the ethereum mainnet.  King told CoinDesk:  ""Then, anyone can be a cartographer and help come up with a consensus-driven map of the world.""

42380797,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zSNX,1528369846,Bullish Signals Hint at Bitcoin Price Breakout,"Still stuck in a narrowing price range, BTC could soon rise to resistance above $8,000 if the bulls are able to leap the 50-week moving average hurdle.  As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $7,770 on Bitfinex, having been stuck in a narrowing price range (pennant) for months now.  Defense of $7,000 last week and the 9.3 percent rise since then have neutralized the immediate bearish outlook and got investors talking about a possible rally to pennant resistance at $8,870.  While that target may appear far-fetched, it may be put to test if bitcoin can first scale the key 50-week moving average (MA) resistance (currently located at $7,819) in a convincing manner.  Weekly chart  As seen in the chart above, BTC narrowly avoided a downside (bearish) break of the narrowing price range last week, turning higher from $7,040. A bearish breakdown would have signaled a resumption of the sell-off from the record high of $19,891 and could have pushed BTC below $6,000 (February low).  However, the subsequent rally to close to $7,700 has neutralized that threat. While it's still too early to say that bitcoin is now aiming for $8,880 (pennant resistance), the probability would rise sharply if we see an aggressive run above the significant resistance of the 50-week MA.  Such a move would invalidate the long-run bearish reversal indicated by the weekly close in the third week of May below the moving average. A move above the 50-week MA would also need to be backed by a solid rise in trading volumes to break out of the pennant.  In a promising sign for the bulls, the daily chart below shows that bitcoin is positioned for a convincing break above the 50-week moving average hurdle.  Daily chart  The upside break of the falling channel seen earlier this week indicates a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change. The 5- and 10-day MAs are also biased to the bulls, as is the higher lows pattern indicated by the rising trendline.  So, a break above the immediate resistance at $7,780 (June 3 high) could yield a quisignificantck rally to over $8,000. The bullish move would also add credence to ""6th of the month"" theory, which had hinted at a major bullish reversal based on an alternating monthly cycle.  View  BTC could rally to well over $8,000 in the next 24 hours or so if the resistance at $7,780 is breached.  BTC looks set to close this week (Sunday's close as per UTC) above the 50-week MA of $7,819. In this case, the probability of a move higher towards pennant resistance of $8,880 would rise sharply.  Bearish scenario: BTC could drop to pennant support at $7,080 if the bulls fail to capitalize on the positive setup seen in the daily chart and prices drop below $7,372 (June 5 low).  A weekly close below$7,080 (downside break of the pennant pattern) could yield a sell-off below $6,000 (February low).

42380787,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zSDT,1528367710,Dutch Central Bank: Blockchain 'Promising But Inefficient' in Payments,"Blockchain technology isn't a beneficial addition to the payment system in the Netherlands – at least not yet, according to the country's central bank.  In a blog post published Thursday, De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) came to the conclusion that distributed ledger technology (DLT) is not suitable for its existing financial payment infrastructure due to its insufficient ability to scale for large volumes of transactions and other issues.  The DNB offered the opinion based on the results of a project called Dukaton, which conducted a series of experiments that has tested four DLT prototypes over the past three years.  Dukaton set out to conduct research in a bid to understand how much value the nascent technology can bring to the country's existing payment system. Basing its first prototype on the source code of the bitcoin blockchain, the team applied different consensus algorithms and validation mechanisms in later stages.  Following the tests, the central bank acknowledges that blockchain can increase the resilience of financial infrastructure against external attacks, however, this benefit comes at the expense of ""scalability, capacity and efficiency,"" it said.  The bank wrote in the post:  ""The current payment systems are very efficient, can handle large volumes and provide the legal certainty of payment. The blockchain solutions tested show that they are not sufficiently efficient, with regard to costs and energy consumption, and they can not handle large numbers of transactions.""  That said, the DNB does not rule out the possibility that, as the blockchain industry moves forward, a better designed algorithm would be able to meet all the technological thresholds required by the Dutch financial system.  To that effort, the central bank said it will continue investing in further application development and conducting experiments with blockchain technology.  In similar work, South Africa's central bank yesterday announced positive results for its trial of its blockchain-based system for interbank clearance and settlement.  The South Africa Reserve Bank said it had completed a 14-week ""realistic"" proof-of-concept that settled the country's typical 70,000 daily payment transactions within two hours, while preserving full confidentiality.

The company said in the announcement that the work is being formally rolled out after it has worked with 65 companies within its Blockchain Co-Innovation Initiative that trialed blockchain applications in various industries such as supply chain, manufacturing, transportation, food and pharmaceuticals.  Earlier last month, CoinDesk reported that the company is working with the U.S. sausage maker Johnsonville, as well as Naturipe Farms and Maple Leaf, to pilot a project that tracks the origin of food products across the supply chain as a part of its Farm to Consumer initiative.  In addition to its co-innovation program, SAP has also announced it is forming a blockchain consortium, members of which are entitled to use tech developed by the group. Notable firms in the consortium currently include HP Enterprise, Intel and UPS.  The work marks SAP as the latest tech giant that has rolled out a platform for blockchain application development, following similar works done by Microsoft, IBM and China's Baidu and Tencent.

In a speech made at an event in Singapore on Wednesday, central bank governor Veerathai Santiprabhob indicated that developing a wholesale central bank digital currency is currently in the pipeline as part of the country's wider efforts in trialing blockchain technology in various sectors.  The project, dubbed Inthanon, seeks to create the bank's own blockchain-based cryptocurrency to make interbank transactions both faster and cheaper.  The initial goal of the trial, according to Santiprabhob, is to understand the potential of this technology before moving to bring CBDC into larger scale of real life use.  He said in the speech:  ""Like other central banks, our goal is not to immediately bring CBDC into use, but rather to explore its potential and implications for back-office operations. These efforts should pave way for faster and cheaper transaction and validation due to less intermediation needed compared to the current systems.""  The effort follows Bank of Thailand's several existing work in exploring blockchain technology.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, in March, 14 Thai banks joined the central bank in March in piloting a shared blockchain platform to digitize letters of guarantee in the country. That work, according to Santiprabhob in the latest speech is ""expected to become operational in the second half of this year.""  In addition, Santiprabhob said his agency is also testing a proof-of-concept that uses a blockchain platform to issue bonds digitally, and could reduce ""bond allocation to retail investors from 15 days to 2 days.""

Yonhap  reported Wednesday that the cybercrime investigation unit of the country's southern provincial police department alleged that Coinone's crypto margin trading is, in effect, offering illegal gambling that could be used to launder criminal proceeds.  The police department further referred to results from its 10-month investigation, which found about 19,000 users had participated in margin trading on the platform, among which some 20 traders had become primary targets due to their high volume of trading.  The high-volume traders, as alleged by the police, in total handled over 3 billion won ($2.8 million) in 3,000 to 13,000 instances of margin trading using Coinone's service, which is deemed illegal gambling by the police after reviewing existing law.  The police department indicated it plans to recommend three executives from Coinone, including its CEO Myunghun Cha, to the prosecutor's office to be charged, as well as the 20 high-volume traders, the report said.  Coinone offered its margin trading service from November 2016 to December of last year and according to the report, the police started the investigation in August 2017, marking one of its earliest efforts to more deeply scrutinize the business operations of domestic cryptocurrency exchanges.  In an email response to a CoinDesk enquiry for comment, a representative from Coinone stated:  ""At this time we are focused on cooperating with the ongoing investigation, and will continue to do so as the case is in the process of moving over to the Prosecution Service from the Police Agency.""

42380791,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zSHF,1528344057,Where's EOS? Rival Groups Now Competing to Launch Official Blockchain,"UPDATE (7 June 3:30 UTC): This article covers a complex grassroots launch of the EOS blockchain. CoinDesk has since learned that EOS Mainnet Launch Group has settled on one chain candidate. ""We have been having validation and go/no-go calls every 12 hours that have rallied both groups into a common work plan,"" EOS Canada's Marc-Antoine Ross told CoinDesk.  The ongoing blockchain launch for the hotly anticipated token project EOS is becoming a bit more complicated.  No, this isn't the product of a hard fork, whereby users weren't able to work out their differences. In the case of EOS, it's blockchain, set to launch over the weekend, still hasn't even been created. Now, amidst an elaborate, global rollout, two competing groups of EOS enthusiasts are testing different versions of the software, each seeking to issue the most widely used version.  That this is possible is largely the result of a company called Block.one, the startup that developed the EOS software after raising more than $4 billion in a token sale. Upon completion of the code, the company opted for an unorthodox choice, effectively turning it over to its global users, who are tasked with launching the chain.  Currently, a snapshot of the ethereum blockchain (where EOS tokens were initially launched) has been taken to prove who owns what coins. That snapshot will then be used to make sure EOS investors get their rightful tokens on the new EOS blockchain.  But even though that's been done, the testing phase before the EOS blockchain launches live is not over. And the work these separate groups are doing on their respective software could have big impacts on how much control each party has once the blockchain is launched.  Each group is made up of organizations aiming to secure the lucrative ""job,"" serving as a validators of blocks or ""block producers"" – a role in which they will be rewarded with newly-issued EOS tokens.  Because all EOS users will vote on who gets the 21 validator positions, these two chains show every indication of being motivated (at least in part) by the fact that those responsible for the architecture that launches as the ""real"" EOS mainnet will accrue major accolades – credibility, name recognition and trust – that are needed to secure one of those spots.  Although, nearly all the participants will vehemently deny that has any bearing on their interest in helping launch the blockchain. Instead, they say there's no competition, it's just experimentation.  But it's not difficult to discern that there's serious tension between the two groups.  Steve Floyd of EOS Tribe, an organization that's part of a group called EOS Core, said:  ""We're in a meritocracy in EOS. Of course people are trying to get elected and get their names out.""  Still, even with this competition, both groups are in unison on the fact that only one EOS blockchain can survive and be presented to the community. Indeed, both groups have pledged to stand down if the other group's software launched first.  Echoing this on May 5, the EOS Mainnet Launch Group (EMLG), effectively a coalition that most of the block producer candidates have publicly expressed buy in to, put out a unified statement, saying, ""Two candidate chains currently exist which have been used as the basis for our thorough testing over the last 48 hours. Per the original EMLG statement, only one will be presented to the community as the mainnet called EOS.""  The two tribes  That same message was cross-posted by all block producer candidates underscores its broad validity. Yet, behind the scenes, at least until one of the softwares launch, the two groups will give voice to their differences.  One of the groups actually started as an independent EOS security research group, going by the name ""Ghostbusters,"" but then evolved its strategy to start working toward a mainnet blockchain launch. According to Floyd, that was after several block producer candidates asked the Ghostbusters group to do so.  When it launched its test version of the software, Ghostbusters declared itself ""EOS Core,"" seemingly in a nod to Bitcoin Core and the contentious debates that have revolved around the varying implementations for that software.  The EOS Core group has argued that its implementation is security-first, with Floyd contending they need to be ""extra vigilant"" since a significant number of cryptocurrency stakeholders, like those heavily invested in ethereum, have been skeptical of EOS and ""don't want EOS to succeed.""  But the other group, going by the name ""Bios Boot,"" doesn't think that's a fair representation since it suggests that Bios Boot is not as interested in security.  Marc-Antoine Ross, CEO of EOS Canada, a block producer candidate that's a part of the Bios Boot group, told CoinDesk:  ""We think it's quite condescending on their part.""  Ross continued, stating that the EOS Core chain hasn't been validated for some time and it's software is not open source, so people are not able to verify what they're working on.  Plus, according to Ross, one facet the EOS Core group is missing is a fallback method for getting the ERC-20 EOS tokens that users never claimed onto the new EOS blockchain.  ""That's a meaningful amount of money for people that were not able to get registered,"" he said.  Yet EOS Core participant, Floyd countered that, saying the group's words of caution about the transition have been unheeded by some users for months (the full disclosure came out over roughly a three month process).  Don't brag  Still, this seemingly bad blood could prove beneficial for EOS, since multiple architectures may help calibrate the best one, and if two groups compete to stand up the network, they each have a stronger incentive to get it right.  Echoing this during a recent YouTube show, Eric Björk of EOS Sw/Eden, which is a part of EOS Core, said, ""We really value diversity.""  And according to a spokesperson for EOS Rio, a founding member of both Ghostbusters and EOS Core, ""Regardless of the result, chains are being tested and best practices are being discovered. This is being a truly beautiful process and we are very happy about it.""  And supposedly that collaboration will continue even after the mainnet has launched.  ""Most of the leading block producers, internally we have all pledged not to brag about whoever did what in the launch process,"" Ross said,  Although, shortly thereafter, Ross seemed to plug Bios Boots, whose implementation was created by EOS Canada, saying, ""EOS Canada, as the creator of the only complete and open source solution, we have publicly said we will never say whether it was used or not and whether we did it or not.""  And Floyd told CoinDesk EOS Core only entered the spotlight reluctantly because of security concerns, continuing that Bios Boots were the ones that were ""very aggressive about getting credit.""  Yet, even with all the ""he said, she said,"" at the end of the day, it seems like both parties are interested in getting the mainnet launched as soon as possible.  According to statements from EMLG, the mainnet launch could happen as early as Thursday.  ""I think time is of essence right now. We are reaching a point where we have a lot of validation that has been going on, a lot of impatient people are being stalled,"" Ross said, adding with assurance: ""I'm not seeing a split. I'm seeing different testing and validation strategies.""  And speaking broadly about the days-long process of asking its community to take the EOS blockchain live, during the aforementioned YouTube show, Vahid Toosi of EOS Sw/Eden said:  ""It might have been the largest social experiment online ever.""
