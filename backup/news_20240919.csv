33771279,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=643026,1726788618,"XRP Price Prediction: Crypto Pundit Predicts Historical 9,468% Pump To $27","A new XRP price prediction by popular crypto pundit Egrag Crypto projects that the cryptocurrency could experience a historical price surge of about 9,468%. This predicted price gain would push XRP from its current price of $0.58 to $27, marking new All-Time Highs (ATHs). XRP Price Forecasted To Pump To These Targets Egrag Crypto has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to express his bullish outlook on XRP, predicting the cryptocurrency could surge as high as $27. On Wednesday, September 18, the crypto analyst shared a price chart illustrating a speculative breakdown of potential price movements for XRP using five distinctive color indicators to represent various price increase scenarios. Related Reading: October To Remember: Descending Broadening Wedge Says Bitcoin Is Going To $90,000 Each of these scenarios has been carefully analyzed, grounded on historical price trends and past price pumps. Additionally, the color indicators — white, yellow, red, blue, and green, are all arranged respectively to represent the ascending price potential of XRP. The white color indicator predicts that XRP is set to witness a 932% pump from the analyst’s predicted cycle low of $0.28. While this scenario is relatively conservative compared to other projections, if XRP can achieve the predicted pump, its price could surge to $3, nearing current all-time highs. The yellow color indicator foresees XRP increasing by 1,538%, potentially driving its price to fresh all-time highs of $4.85. While this target is much higher than the white scenario, it is still within the realm of possibility if the cryptocurrency maintains a positive momentum. The red indicator projects that XRP’s price will jump to $6.22, marking a 2,035% increase. This massive surge would signal a strong bull run for the cryptocurrency, likely reflecting the influence of major external factors such as mass adoption and more legal clarity. In the blue color scenario, XRP is set to reach a higher price of $7.68, representing a whopping 2,536% increase. At this price, XRP would likely be seen as a major player in the market with potential long-term viability. Finally, the green color indicator predicts that XRP could witness a 9,468% price surge, potentially driving the cryptocurrency to a staggering $27. Although this ambitious prediction would be a historic achievement, it remains a far-fetched possibility with XRP’s current market dynamics. XRP Community Express Skepticism While Egrag Crypto’s bullish projections for XRP raise the hopes of investors who have been HODLing the coin for years now despite its low value and persistent consolidation phase, many have also expressed doubts. A few crypto members criticized the analyst, calling him out for his overly bullish forecasts for XRP. Related Reading: Ethereum In 2021 Vs. 2024: Fractal Suggests Major Breakout In Q4 Other members found the ambitious price predictions humorous, declaring that XRP is a “shit coin” and would remain so for a long period. Additionally, one crypto member underscored XRP’s long-term stagnant growth, highlighting that he had bought $1,000 worth of the cryptocurrency early last year but only accrued a profit of $100.

42390362,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bcUwU7,1726783571,"U.S. Election Betting: CFTC, Kalshi Both Grilled by Judges in Appeals Court","A panel of judges grilled attorneys for the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and prediction-betting platform Kalshi over the company's efforts to launch political prediction markets in the U.S., without indicating whether they'd allow Kalshi to offer these products while reviewing a lower court's ruling on the products.  CFTC General Counsel Rob Schwartz and Jones Day Partner Yaakov Roth took turns explaining why an appeals court should or should not block Kalshi from listing these events contracts.  The Thursday hearing came days after a federal judge ruled that the CFTC could not block Kalshi from listing political prediction markets, letting the company list contracts predicting how control of the House and Senate might play out. But it only lasted for a few hours, since the CFTC quickly filed for an emergency stay, which the appeals court granted on a temporary basis.  During the 2.5-hour hearing, the judges did not seem especially impressed by either party, saying various arguments or explanations did not make sense and drilling into specific terms of the Commodity Exchange Act and what they mean. The judges did not get to asking what an event contract actually is until more than two hours into the hearing.  The CFTC's Schwartz called D.C. District Court Judge Jia Cobb's Sept. 12 ruling ""seriously flawed,"" and said it could allow Kalshi – and other companies – to immediately launch ""high-stakes"" betting markets.  ""If that happens, the harm to the public is going to be profound at a time, and I don't mean to be dramatic, but Americans broadly believe that our democracy is under threat,"" Schwartz said.  ""In order to obtain a stay, the commission has to show two things: merit, and that there will be some harm, irreparable harm, absent the stay, and they can't make either of those,"" Roth said in his opening statement.  Kalshi saw $50,000 deposited in its two political events contracts in the eight hours or so that the products were live before the CFTC filed for an emergency stay, Roth said.  Market manipulation concerns  The CFTC's arguments revolve around the agency's stated inability to police the underlying events – namely, U.S. elections.  Market participants could distort markets to suggest one candidate is doing better than another, Schwartz said, and it would be more difficult to correct than other markets.  A judge posed the hypothetical question of whether a counterparty might take the other side of a bet made for manipulative purposes: ""Somebody will take the other side and eat their lunch. Is that what's supposed to happen?""  That is what should happen, but political prediction markets may be susceptible to manipulation that cannot be easily corrected, Schwartz said.  ""It's because the sources of information that they absorb and reflect are opaque and unreliable. I am talking about polls with undisclosed methodologies, so, bad methodologies, fake polls, pollsters with agendas, inaccurate news, fake news, on and on,"" he said. ""Normal futures contracts have an objective indicator that is reliable, kind of a published index report.""  If these markets are manipulated, that would both harm the market participants and could even undermine election integrity, Schwartz said. Later in the hearing, he drew a distinction between political event contracts and other types of bets that could be placed.  ""There's really very little monkeying around you can do with an earthquake,"" Schwartz said, responding to one example.  Roth, speaking on Kalshi's behalf, pushed back, saying the more robust a market is, the less susceptible it would be to that type of manipulation.  He pointed to the $1 billion already bet on Polymarket, which does not offer services in the U.S. after a settlement with the CFTC, saying the regulator's argument essentially suggests having an overseas vendor provide these products may be better than Kalshi doing so.  ""The most important thing I want to make is that the way to reduce that risk is to allow Kalshi markets to offer because right now, this activity is happening and being reported to voters based on markets that are not regulated, that are open to foreign traders, that have no surveillance. … There's no transparency,"" he said. ""We don't know who's buying, who's selling cryptocurrency. If this was happening on Kalshi's markets, we would have this whole suite of regulatory provisions that apply.""  'Irreparable harm'  The CFTC needed to show there was a risk of ""irreparable harm"" in allowing Kalshi to continue listing and trading its events contracts. Todd Phillips, an assistant professor of law at the Georgia State University Robinson College of Business, told CoinDesk it was ""unclear if [the CFTC] did that"" over the course of the hearing.  The regulator could have done a better job explaining what event contracts actually are and how a state prohibiting gambling on elections counts as gaming for the purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act, he said.  On the other hand, Kalshi also faced tough questioning from the panel of judges on the appeals court.  ""Kalshi is making an argument that 'you should allow us to do something that 29 states prohibit, and that's big,"" he said. ""That would be effectively overturning the law in more than half the country.

Although bulls appear to be taking the lead given its current market performance, will this be sustainable? Before the US Federal Reserve announcement of the rate cuts, Bitcoin experienced a slight dip in its trading price. However, following the announcement, the leading crypto saw a sudden price surge, reclaiming the $60,000 mark. Bitcoin continues to show bullish strength, trading at $63,006, reflecting a 5.6% increase over the past 24 hours. Related Reading: CME Traders Bet Big Against Bitcoin As US Fed Rate Cut Looms Is This Bitcoin Rally For Real? The sudden bullish performance from Bitcoin recorded over the past day has had several traders and analysts sharing their respective outlooks on the asset, with many focusing on the next potential trajectory of Bitcoin’s price. Despite the ongoing upward momentum, some experts urge caution, highlighting underlying market signals that could impact the sustainability of this bullish trend. One such expert, crypto trader Josh Olszewicz, shared his insights on this matter, suggesting that while the current picture appears optimistic, there are still some concerns to consider before expecting a continued uptrend. According to Olszewicz, Bitcoin’s recent move led it above the daily Ichimoku Cloud—a technical analysis indicator used to gauge market trends—signaling a potential bullish scenario. However, he emphasized that this indicator alone does not guarantee a sustained upward trend. Specifically, Olszewicz pointed out that the Cloud and the Tenkan-Sen and Kijun-Sen (TK) cross are still in a bearish formation. $BTC We are once again back above the daily Cloud, although we still have a bearish Cloud and bearish TK cross.

For a more definitive bullish signal, the Cloud needs to flip into a bullish mode, along with a bullish TK cross, Olszewicz disclosed. This setup would provide a stronger confirmation for a bullish continuation. Olszewicz also noted that previous Kumo breakouts this year have failed to lead to significant price gains, adding uncertainty to the current breakout. He suggested that analyzing Bitcoin on a longer timeframe, such as the two-day Ichimoku Cloud, might offer a clearer perspective.

The matter has been closely followed in crypto markets, since the Sky platform has $200 million of loans collateralized by the token, and since WBTC is one of the biggest cryptocurrencies, with nearly $10 billion outstanding.  BA Labs, an influential advisor to the project, had initially floated the idea of reducing exposure to WBTC in August, before confirming the plan last week with an official proposal to move ahead with the vote to eliminate the exposure entirely.  This week's Sky vote, which went live on Monday and was open for three days, and saw 88% of participants vote in favor of ditching wBTC in five separate proposals for a five-step offboarding process. Some 12% abstained.  Following the vote, Sky will move forward with the offboarding of WBTC, with the first phase starting on Oct. 3 and culminating in the final phase on Nov. 28.  BA Labs, in its proposals to offboard WBTC, had cited perceived risks from Tron founder Justin Sun's involvement with BiTGlobal, the custodian for the underlying assets. BitGo, the original custodian for WBTC, announced in August that it planned to transition control of the asset to a joint operation with BiT Global, which has regulated operations based in Hong Kong.  Sun told CoinDesk last week that WBTC has a ""sterling track record that is unmatched by any competing offers recently floated by the skeptics.""  WBTC is a token that allows investors to use bitcoin (BTC) on other blockchains, such as Ethereum, and often is at the center of the DeFi lending space as collateral. WBTC currently has a $9.7 billion market capitalization.  Separately, The Defiant reported that the community behind Aave, the biggest DeFi lender, is unconvinced of the need to offboard WBTC as collateral.

42390357,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bcUvzL,1726778781,"German Government Shuts Down 47 Exchanges, Says They're Tied To ‘Illegal Activity’","German authorities shut down dozens of crypto platforms they say were connected to the illicit movement of assets.  The exchanges weren't properly tracking their customers' activity, according to the Federal Criminal Police Office.  The German Attorney General's Office Frankfurt am Main (Generalstaatsanwaltschaft) and the country’s Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) have shut down 47 crypto exchanges allegedly tied to criminal activities including money laundering.  The exchanges purposefully failed to comply with their obligation to carry out certain identity and background checks on their customers, also known as “know your customer” (KYC) requirements, the BKA said in a press release on Thursday.  Some of the exchanges include Xchange.cash, 60cek.org, Baksman.com, alongside other smaller platforms. One of the exchanges had been active since 2012 while others had launched as recently as the previous year.  Some customer and transaction data was seized by the government in the process of the investigation, it said. Given that the people behind those activities often reside in other countries outside of Germany, where criminal activities like this are “tolerated or even protected,” the authorities noted it may be nearly impossible for German government officials to prosecute them.  Instead, they will focus on “weakening” the underlying infrastructure that allowed for those illegal activities, according to the statement.  Earlier this year, the BKA seized 49,857 bitcoin {{BTC}}, worth $2.1 billion at the time, from the operators of a privacy website called Movie2k.to, which was shut down in 2013 for violating the Copyright Act.  The agency proceeded to sell the tokens in July, causing distress in the global crypto markets due to the selling pressure resulting from the dump as well as the simultaneous repayments by defunct bitcoin exchange Mt.

42390376,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bcUx41,1726778283,Bitcoin Faces Key Test at $64K as Altcoins Lead Crypto Rally; Options Traders Bet on $70K BTC Next Month,"Cryptocurrencies surged higher with bitcoin {{BTC}} nearing $64,000 on Thursday as the Federal Reserve's jumbo rate cut bolstered risk appetite across asset classes.  Bitcoin climbed nearly 6% over the past 24 hours from Wednesday's whipsaw below $60,000 as traders digested the Fed's decision to lower benchmark interest rates by 50 basis points, a move many observers say may mark the beginning of an easing cycle by the U.S. central bank. The largest crypto hit its highest price this month at $63,800 during the U.S. trading hours before stalling and retracing to just above $63,000.  Ethereum's ether {{ETH}}, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, bounced off from its crucial 200-week simple moving average and was up over 7% during the same period.  The broad-based crypto benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index outperformed BTC and ETH with its 8% advance, indicating that altcoins led the market higher with native tokens of Solana {{SOL}}, Avalanche {{AVAX}} and Aptos {{APT}} up 10%-15%. All the 20 assets of the index were up today, underscoring the breadth of the rally.  Crypto-focused stocks and listed bitcoin miners also surged, with MicroStrategy (MSTR) and TeraWulf (WULF) leading the sector with 10% gains.  Crypto’s rally over the past 24 hours outperformed most traditional financial asset classes. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq, two stock indexes that bitcoin recently has correlated with, traded 1.7% and 2.5% higher, respectively.  This could be because non-yielding assets like bitcoin or gold are typically preferred investments when interest rates are lower, said Jim Iuorio, managing director of TJM Institutional Services and host of the Futures Edge podcast.  “These assets prefer rates that are lower than where they should be relative to the current economic condition,” he said. “They do well in an environment that could reignite inflation.”  The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield moved higher after the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates on Wednesday which signals that inflation remains a worry. Similarly, bitcoin’s uptick in price could indicate that the Fed’s decision to lower rates may be premature and could result in a weakening of the U.S. dollar, Iuorio added.  Key test for BTC rally at $64,000  Bitcoin's rally faces a key hurdle at the $64,000 level, which was the local peak last month, bouncing from the early August crash due to the strengthening Japanese yen carry trade. The leading crypto should make a higher high to break the bearish trend of making consecutive lower lows since the $73,000 peak in March.  ""The easy part of the cycle is almost done,"" Bob Loukas, a well-followed trader and analyst, said, based on bitcoin's daily cycle pattern. Cycles theory argues that price movements happen in waves with roughly regular periodicity. ""Soon bitcoin will have to work for the gains,"" he added.  Even with a potential pullback in the cards, options traders are anticipating higher bitcoin prices for next month heading into the historically bullish period for the asset.  Options data for October 25, 2024 expiry on crypto derivatives exchange Deribit reveals significant interest at the $70,000 strike, with $130 million in notional value, CoinDesk analyst James Van Stratten noted.  The total open interest stands at 34,199 BTC, with a put/call ratio of 0.55, reflecting a strong bullish sentiment in the market, he added.  While September has been the worst performing month for BTC with an average loss of -4% since 2013, the year-end period starting with October usually brings the greatest returns for the asset, CoinGlass data shows. October's average monthly return is 23%, while Q4's tally is 88% gain, per CoinGlass.",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Krisztian Sandor, Helene Braun",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/19/bitcoin-faces-key-test-at-64k-as-altcoins-lead-crypto-rally-options-traders-bet-on-70k-btc-next-month,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6f95f6c1af07d91713f9bb16b05bbcb86f955238-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

33767155,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=643165,1726777834,Solana Active Addresses Hit 75 Million As SOL Breaches $140,"Solana (SOL) hit another record: Today, it has over 75 million monthly active addresses. The surge speaks to growing popularity of the network, especially in areas like developer and user activity within the decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi, and NFT sectors. Related Reading: Cardano Goes Bullish On-Chain: Can ADA Price Catch Up? With such an increase in Solana’s activities, the platform stretches even further away from others as it remains one of the most scalable and efficient blockchains available. Despite this positive momentum, recent market activity has seen significant volatility for SOL. On September 18, Solana experienced $121,000 in short liquidations and nearly $3.20 million in long liquidations, with Binance seeing the majority of the long positions liquidated. This heavy liquidation of long positions signals that traders might be cautious about the near-term price movements of Solana. Source: Artemis Price Forecast Shows Potential While short-term volatility is a concern, Solana’s price forecast points to a brighter future. Currently, SOL is trading 14.59% below its estimated value for next month, indicating short-term bearish pressure. However, the price is predicted to grow by 2.59% over the next three months, with even stronger growth expected further down the road. In six months, Solana’s price could surge by 115%, with a 52% increase projected over the next year. This indicates that though the short-term future is not so promising, Solana is a big investment prospect in the long-run. At the time of writing, SOL is trading at $141.21 up 10.1% and 4.1% in the daily and weekly timeframes, data from Coingecko shows. Surge In User Activity One of the key factors why Solana has strong potential is that it has an increasingly growing user base. Active addresses on the network increased exponentially, from mid-2023, and stood at 75.2 million in absolute terms so far. That reflects that Solana is scaling well and can process large volumes of transactions while the fees are low; more developers and users flocked to the platform, and Solana’s ecosystem continues to grow. This user growth isn’t just a short-term phenomenon. The launch of new features and updates in the coming months could further accelerate adoption, particularly in the DeFi and NFT spaces where scalability is a key factor. Related Reading: Bitcoin On Track For $92,000 ‘Bounce’ In 3 Months, Analyst Predicts A Network For The Future? The growth in active addresses as well as the bright price forecast should put Solana on stable ground. Although liquidations and sideways movement in near-term might raise some concerns among the investors, the long run looks promising. For now, investors may need to be cautious about short-term volatility, but Solana’s long-term prospects remain solid. Those looking to invest for the future may find Solana’s current price a good entry point before the predicted growth takes hold.

42390365,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bcUwZF,1726774463,Does SBF’s Appeal Stand a Chance of Succeeding?,"It’s been about 10 months since Sam Bankman-Fried was convicted on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy related to the collapse of FTX. It’s been about six months since he was sentenced (in March) to 25 years in federal prison.  In that time, the crypto industry has moved on: markets are up, VC dollars are back, and politicians are once again supporting the industry. Meanwhile, the mainstream media has almost forgotten about the fallen crypto king, SBF himself. So might a judge and jury see SBF’s case differently should it hear evidence from the FTX founder again?  That certainly seems to be the hope of SBF’s new legal team, which took over his case after his trial lawyers, Mark Cohen and Christian Everdell, stepped down following his conviction. On Friday, Sept. 13, his new lead lawyer, Alexandra Shapiro, filed an appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, laying out why SBF believes he deserves another hearing.  “In the United States, people accused of crimes are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,” Shapiro's appeal begins. “They are entitled to a fair trial by a jury. When the government introduces evidence, defendants have the right to rebut that evidence and present their side of the story. That, at least, is how it’s supposed to work. But none of that happened here.”  The 102-page document argues that SBF was unfairly treated at trial, which took place as public scrutiny of the FTX case reached a fever pitch. Shapiro argues SBF was “presumed guilty by federal prosecutors eager for quick headlines,” “presumed guilty by the judge who presided over his trial,” and that the “prevailing narrative” of FTX’s collapse, and SBF’s part in it, was accepted as true, without proper inquiry.  “From day one, the prevailing narrative—initially spun by the lawyers who took over FTX, quickly adopted by their contacts at the U.S. Attorney’s Office—was that Bankman-Fried had stolen billions of dollars of customer funds, driven FTX to insolvency, and caused billions in losses,” the appeal continues.  “Now, nearly two years later, a very different picture is emerging—one confirming FTX was never insolvent, and in fact had assets worth billions to repay its customers. But the jury at BankmanFried’s trial never got to see that picture.”  SBF has long maintained that FTX was never really insolvent and it was forced into bankruptcy unnecessarily. It notes that, under the bankruptcy settlement, nearly all its customers are being made whole. Shapiro says Judge Lewis A. Kaplan deprived the jury of “Brady” evidence favorable to the defendant, including that SBF made good investments (such as in Anthropic, the AI startup) alongside the bad ones.  However, lawyers contacted by CoinDesk were skeptical that SBF would win a retrial, given the high bar for such legal turnovers.  “It’s just not very common for an appellate court to double-guess a case like this,” said Tama Beth Kudman, partner at Kudman Trachten Aloe Posner.  SBF’s lawyers would have to prove not only that Kaplan was biased against SBF, she said, and also that such bias led to actions that were prejudicial against SBF.  To allow the appeal to go forward, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals would be saying effectively that it thought the judge in the original case acted inappropriately – something it rarely does, Kudman said.  The appeals court might order a retrial if SBF's lawyers could show that Kaplan had a personal conflict of interest. But there’s no evidence for that, thus far. “Kaplan is known as a well-tempered, good natured judge. I would have thought he would have stepped aside if there was any reason that he shouldn’t be hearing the case,” Kudman said.  Joshua Ashley Klayman, the U.S. head of fintech and head of blockchain and digital assets at Linklaters, said the appeal may have been timed to coincide with sentencing for Caroline Ellison, SBF’s former colleague and sometime lover.  U.S. government lawyers have not requested jail time for Ellison, noting that the SBF case would have been “difficult to prove” without her testimony. Shapiro may be trying to juxtapose SBF’s steep sentencing with Ellison’s much lighter penalty.  “Without expressing a view on the likelihood of success of Sam Bankman-Fried’s appeal, the timing of his filing may be strategic,"" Klayman said. ""SBF’s appeal was filed on September 13, 2024, three days after the filing of Caroline Ellison’s sentencing memorandum. SBF was sentenced to 25 years in prison, while Caroline Ellison’s counsel has requested a non-custodial sentence.""  Klayman said news that FTX creditors are being repaid could help SBF's legal team.  “The mainstream media has reported on FTX’s plans to repay customers. Perhaps SBF and his counsel may hope that, with the passage of time, SBF’s arguments [that FTX customers didn’t lose money] may be viewed in a different light.""  Joe Valenti,partner in the White Collar & Government Enforcement practice at law firm Saul Ewing, says appeals courts tend to give significant discretion to judges in weighing evidence, provided they meet a basic standard of reasonableness.  ""Anything that's tied to the reading of the facts, or the conduct of the courtroom, they give significant leeway to the court,"" he said. Judges are allowed to control the courtroom in the interest of expeditious justice and limiting evidence from being admitted to the record is well within the discretion of the judge.  As for the argument that customers are being made whole in bankruptcy, Valenti doesn't see that argument holding much water either.  ""It doesn't matter if the money was paid back. If you're a cashier at the supermarket and you take $20 to go to the casino, it doesn’t matter if you give back the money the next day. You still took money from the grocery store.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION,Benjamin Schiller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/09/19/does-sbfs-appeal-stand-a-chance-of-succeeding,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6a9c13f56bdb586208a52945859e337a3744f857-5500x3094.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390375,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bcUxEH,1726773358,Ethereum Developers Confirm Plan to Split 'Pectra' Upgrade In Two,"Ethereum developers agreed on Thursday to split their upcoming hard fork, Pectra, into two packages, in a move to make the massive upgrade less unwieldy and reduce the risk of missteps or bugs.  The decision to split up the upgrade wasn't unexpected. Developers had discussed previously that Pectra was becoming too ambitious to ship all at once, floating the idea of splitting it up in order to minimize the risk of finding bugs in the code.  Pectra was on track to be Ethereum’s biggest hard fork to date. (A hard fork is the technical term for when a blockchain splits from its original, and is the method used by Ethereum to implement major software upgrades.) Now, developers will be able to focus on a much narrower scope. Previously, developers shared they would aim to have the upgrade live in early 2025; that is still the case for the first part of the Pectra package.  The core developers decided that eight Ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs) will be included in the first package, which includes EIP-7702, aimed at improving the user-experience of wallets, and famously scribbled by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in 22 minutes.  The second package is up to be changed over the next few months, but as of now could include proposals that aim to make changes to the Ethereum Virtual Machine, known as EOF, along with introducing a feature called PeerDAS, which improves data availability sampling and ultimately is beneficial for layer-2 blockchains.  The developers acknowledged that the scopes of these upgrades can change over time, so solidifying this upgrade wouldn't be wise in this moment.  ""There seems to be agreements to split current Pectra somehow,"" said Ethereum Foundation researcher Alex Stokes, who led the call. ""And then downstream, we can figure out what comes next.""  “I hear everyone that, it can be tricky to not want to put new things in. I would lean towards, again, keeping the scope very small, just because then that's going to maximize our chances of actually shipping the second fork very quickly with respect to this first one,” Stokes added.

33764971,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=643041,1726772414,Is This The End For Ethereum Or A Generational Opportunity?,"Ethereum holders are definitely being tested by some tough times, with recent price action failing to create a bullish perspective for the digital asset. One of the major disappointments has been the performance of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which were launched in the U.S. with great fanfare. These ETFs were seen by numerous market participants as the key that could unlock significant upward movement for Ethereum. Since their introduction, they have not delivered the expected results, leaving investors frustrated. Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer of Bitwise, a popular crypto index fund manager, continues to maintain a positive ETH outlook. According to him, Ethereum is still at the forefront of blockchain applications that are seeing breakthrough success. This Is Not The End For Ethereum The lack of positive momentum in the Ethereum market has been enough to shake the confidence of seasoned investors. The combination of uncertain macroeconomic factors, rising competition from Solana and other blockchains, and the unmet expectations surrounding the Ethereum ETFs has contributed to the pessimistic outlook for the digital asset. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin All-Time High Only A Month Away After Breaking $60,000 Among the optimists is Matt Hougan, who shared his views in a recent memo. Hougan has maintained a bullish outlook on Ethereum, standing firm in his belief that the current challenges are only temporary and that the asset still has the potential to rebound. Hougan argues that although Ethereum has fallen behind Bitcoin and Solana’s year-to-date growth of 38% and 31%, respectively, the cryptocurrency’s long-term prospects remain strong. In his memo, Hougan highlighted ETH’s continued dominance as the leading blockchain for decentralized applications (dApps), stating that it retains the lion’s share of activity among developers building on blockchain technology. He went as far as to liken Ethereum to the “Microsoft of blockchains.” To support his claim, Hougan pointed to notable examples of Ethereum’s adoption by major companies. One such example is BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund, which launched in March 2024 and now has more than $500 million in assets under management. Another example is Nike’s Web3 gear platform called .Swoosh. Ethereum has the most active developers and users. As such, Hougan believes the blockchain will be first on the radar of the next large traditional company wanting to do a blockchain product. Related Reading: October To Remember: Descending Broadening Wedge Says Bitcoin Is Going To $90,000 What’s Next For ETH? According to Hougan, Ethereum is a contrarian bet for the rest of the year. What this basically means is that he expects Ethereum to go against the ongoing market sentiment and surprise many investors with a bullish run by the end of the year. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $2,440 and is up by 5.2% in the past 24 hours. This recent uptick brings Ethereum close to testing a key resistance level at $2,450 once again.

42390371,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bcUwtl,1726770729,"Bitcoin's Breakout to New Highs Could Be Near, Past Market Cycles Suggest","Bitcoin could be heading for a breakout to new record prices, based on previous cycle's price action.  Historical data suggests price could potentially rise to $108,000 to $155,000.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} has been stuck in a grueling, multi-month correction since hitting $73,000 in March, convincing many investors that the market top is already behind.  However, the recent price action resembles the top cryptocurrency's behavior during the previous two market cycles, which eventually resolved to the upside towards the end of the year. This suggests that a breakout to new record prices could happen in the next months.  Despite bitcoin's anemic performance since March, it's still up 290% from its November 2022 market bottom, in line with the previous two bull markets during the same period, Glassnode data shows. At this point in the four-year cycle, BTC advanced 309% during the 2015 to 2018 bull run and 251% in the 2018 to 2022 cycle.  On both occasions, the periods with the steepest rallies came later in the cycle on the way to the market top. If BTC stays within the range of its previous two cycles until the end of the year, it could rise by 600% to 900% from its cycle low, potentially reaching a price between $108,000 to $155,000.  Typical halving year correction  This year's corrective phase also mirrors the price action of bitcoin's previous two halving years.  BTC reached a mid-cycle peak in 2016 and 2020, followed by months of sideways action to break higher in the latter months of the year, well-followed pseudonymous crypto analyst CryptoCon noted.  The halving event happens automatically every four years and reduces by 50% the issuance of new tokens, which is widely believed to impact bitcoin's supply to create scarcity.  BTC dipped more than 40% from its June 2016 intermediate cycle top before breaking higher in December, TradingView data shows. In 2020, it declined roughly 21% from an August peak to eventually make new highs in late October, per TradingView. In both cases, the real fireworks happened in the next year, hitting a market cycle top.  This year, BTC hit a local peak in March at $73,000 before declining as much as 33% to its early August low. It's getting closer to the end of the typical mid-cycle correction, CryptoCon pointed out.  ""Whether it's cycle top calls or recession predictions, everyone has a reason why they should fear the worst,"" he said. ""Meanwhile, the cycle continues right on track, unscathed.""

From price action in the daily chart, buyers appear to be back in the picture.

Over $21 Billion Of Shorts To Be Liquidated If Bitcoin Breaks $70,500 While buyers double down, flocking back to BTC, looking at the sharp uptick in trading volume over the past day, one analyst on X has identified an interesting observation if bulls continue to dominate. Citing market data and the liquidation map of Binance perpetuals, the analyst said if Bitcoin flies above $70,500, over $21 billion of shorts will be liquidated. Liquidation happens in the perpetuals market where leverage traders aim to clip market volatility for profit. There are longs, or traders banking on bulls to press prices higher, and shots, betting for prices to drop. Related Reading: October To Remember: Descending Broadening Wedge Says Bitcoin Is Going To $90,000 These positions are leveraged in both instances, meaning they borrow funds from the exchange. The collateral, in this case, the margin, acts as an “insurance” for the exchange. As a result, they will forcefully sell it should the market move against the trader. Looking at the state of price action in the daily chart, Bitcoin needs to expand by around 11% from spot rates of $70,500 to be hit. The immediate liquidation level is at around $66,000, marking August highs. If this level is broken, and the leg up is rising trading volume, the resulting rally could easily be the basis for bulls to overcome the intense liquidation pressure of around $70,000 and $72,000. The $70,000 And $72,000 Resistance Zone Is Crucial For BTC Traders Bitcoin bulls have struggled to break $72,000 since the retest in June. Accordingly, any firm and decisive close above $70,000 can trigger a short squeeze. Therefore, it is highly likely that BTC may retest $73,800 and even print print fresh all-time highs.

The meme coin is on the verge of breaking a resistance that could ignite a rally to new highs. Analysts and investors are making bold predictions, with one analyst forecasting a “conservative” 1,000% surge if the price gains momentum. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaking Out Of Monthly Downtrend: Can DOGE Reach $12? DOGE has consistently traded above strong demand levels and targets local highs to break its current price structure. A change in this structure could result in a significant rally, lifting the entire meme coin market to new heights. With market sentiment increasingly bullish, the coming days will determine whether Dogecoin will capitalize on this opportunity. Dogecoin Analyst Expects $3 This Cycle The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a surge after weeks of selling pressure and uncertainty. This has raised optimism among investors waiting for a potential bull run that could begin in the next few weeks. Dogecoin is trading at a critical level that could spark a rally to new highs. Notably, a well-known Dogecoin analyst, Kevin, has shared a bold prediction on X, presenting three possible scenarios based on how this market cycle plays out. Kevin’s technical analysis shows that Dogecoin is on the verge of breaking out of a falling wedge pattern, a classic bullish formation often associated with significant price gains. According to his analysis, DOGE is just a few green weeks away from achieving its first golden cross—a key bullish signal—in over four years. Kevin offers three potential price targets depending on market performance: $0.93 if Dogecoin performs well, $2.27 if it experiences substantial outperformance, and $3.80 in an “astronomical” performance scenario. He notes that these outcomes largely depend on how the broader economic liquidity cycle evolves. Despite the excitement surrounding this prediction, Dogecoin faces potential risks. If the price action fails to keep pace with the crypto market, traders and investors could end up empty-handed. Related Reading: XRP ‘The Safest Investment To Make 100% ROI’ – Former Asset Manager Shares Price Targets The coming weeks will determine whether Dogecoin can break out and target these ambitious price levels. With the broader market showing signs of recovery, all eyes are on DOGE to see if it can capitalize on the momentum and reach new heights. DOGE Holding Strong Above $0.10 Dogecoin is trading at $0.104 after a volatile Wednesday, during which the price surged 5% in less than 24 hours. DOGE is approaching key supply levels around $0.115 after successfully reclaiming the 4-hour 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $0.102 and the 4-hour moving average (MA) at $0.101. This price action suggests short-term strength, sparking optimism among bulls eager to push the price to higher liquidity levels. However, there are risks if DOGE fails to maintain this momentum. If the price struggles to close above $0.108 in the coming days, it could lose its bullish support from these indicators, leading to a deeper correction. In that case, DOGE could potentially target lower prices around $0.097, and losing the 4-hour EMA and MA would indicate weakening momentum.

42390369,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bcUwjV,1726759122,The Maturing Crypto Job Market,"Since the last bull market, we’ve seen a slight fall in the number of crypto jobs available. But, as professional recruiters, we think the market for hiring is as strong as it’s ever been, especially for experienced candidates.  If you are fortunate enough to have been in crypto for three or more years, this is a prime job market for you. Companies are looking for candidates with a track record and specialization. Our advice: Stay in your lane and avoid being the generalist.  A quick LinkedIn search for profiles containing the keyword “blockchain” on their resumes produces 152,000 results while “crypto” shows 119,000. This is a decline from the peak employment in crypto at about 211,000 mid-2021 due to bear markets, inflation, and layoffs affecting the job market.  The industry has been hit hard since the last bull cycle, but it’s not all bad news. Professionals in crypto are loyal and we, as recruiters, don’t see anyone leaving; we only see more qualified candidates looking to join the space.  Our LinkedIn DMs and emails are full of people all over the world sharing their resumes and asking for advice on how to transition to Web3.  Compared to 2021, when we had a huge influx of people rushing to crypto, we are seeing a much larger talent pool of candidates with two to four years’ industry experience. This is a milestone for this young industry because talent is more developed, teams have more hiring options, and companies don’t have to use as many resources for onboarding.  Although the depth of candidate experience has increased, the talent pool must continue to expand in order to keep up with industry growth predictions for the years to come. Competition in hiring roles for protocol engineers and developer relations leaders is stronger than ever due to the rise in expectation of industry experience and demand for core company roles that make up founding teams.  Some recent trends from our job board:  Three firms reached out in the span of two days about hiring a protocol engineer  There has been an uptick in listings for compliance and legal roles during 2024  Candidates with a portfolio/personal brand are much more likely to score a first-round interview.  Crypto twitter remains a great outlet for gaining credibility through personal brand building. We know many candidates that get contacted personally by CEOs and executives through X personal accounts. When recruiting, our team considers X profiles to be a strong complement to resumes and portfolios. We even see an opportunity for LinkedIn to become a prime platform for the Web3 community, provided candidates can post engaging content.  Staying active on X, attending conferences, and leveraging your specialization in your experience will be the best way to position yourself in this market. Find the people that want to help because this is an industry of professionals that win and help others win.  The support is evident through tough moments such as:  After a recent layoff at Matter Labs, the co-founder posted on X the letter he sent to employees accounting the difficult decision. Comments from executives and hiring managers flooded the reply section with support and opportunities for those affected. Our advice: Lean into the warm crypto culture and never forget the strength of the community this industry was built on.  Despite what may seem like challenges and setbacks for crypto from the outside, we are seeing the strongest talent pool to date, fierce competition in hiring, and candidates interviewing with many companies at a time.  Candidates with the most success in the job market display a combination of a personal brand, strong network, and know how to leverage their specific skill sets. The biggest trends we see out of this are portfolios, in-person events, and specialized/customized resumes.  The future looks very promising for this seasoned talent pool dedicated to the crypto and blockchain ethos. As more teams build with strong talent, we’ll likely see a new cycle of growth that will continue to welcome new professionals eager to join this vibrant industry.

42390361,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bcUw4T,1726758000,Crypto for Advisors: Are Advisors Investing in Crypto?,"Are advisors “in” on crypto? This is Crypto for Advisors, after all, so in today’s issue, Roxanna Islam from TMX VettaFi takes us through crypto demand and adoption since the launch of spot ETFs in the U.S.  In Ask an Expert, Bryan Courchesne, CEO of DAIM, looks at whether advisors are supporting their clients investments in crypto and, if not, where the risks lie.  – Sarah Morton  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  When Will We Agree on Crypto Demand?  Many of us thought that the launch of spot crypto ETFs would help bring crypto into the mainstream and encourage adoption - particularly by closing the gap between advisors and their clients. While the spot bitcoin ETF launch in January broke records, demand for spot Ethereum ETFs has been muted. And now with no near-term approval for Solana ETFs, this raises the question – does interest in crypto ETFs end with bitcoin? I believe there will be more to the crypto ETF story, but there are three big questions we need to answer about demand.  1. Are clients ACTUALLY interested in crypto?  Seasoned crypto investors see the benefit of investing directly in cryptocurrencies – not just bitcoin. However, crypto ETFs brought access to other groups of investors, including retail investors who are newer to crypto and more comfortable with a traditional vehicle like an ETF.  And unlike the old-school crypto investor, newer investors may be satisfied with a simpler approach to cryptocurrency investing (i.e., investing in just bitcoin ETFs). Despite the fact that bitcoin and ether (symbol ETH, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain) have two very different use cases, it is very easy to use bitcoin as a “just for fun” investment without fully diversifying their crypto allocation.  This has been reflected in net flows for crypto launches. Excluding the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), spot bitcoin ETFs have seen $37.3 billion in net inflows since their launch in January, with net inflows for the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) bringing in $20.9 billion of those flows. Since their launch in July, spot ether ETFs have seen net inflows of only $2.1 billion (excluding the flagship Grayscale product). The highest inflows were seen in the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), which had only $1.0 billion net inflows – a significant gap from its spot bitcoin counterpart. While I believe interest in spot Ether will grow over time, these trends indicate that mainstream investors still haven’t fully embraced crypto.  2. Are advisors WILLING to allocate to crypto?  Given a niche portion of clients interested in crypto ETFs, the next step is making sure advisors are also open to conversation. The survey results shown below are important because 64% of advisors surveyed—that’s almost two-thirds of advisors—are neutral to negative on cryptocurrencies. Additionally, Bloomberg Terminal data show that the majority of investors who own spot crypto products are self-directed investors—not those who invest through an advisor. According to this data, 80% of shares held of iShares’ (IBIT) and 75% of shares held of the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) are by investors who do not file 13Fs (i.e., self-directed clients).  Unfortunately, there is no clear-cut answer to getting advisors more interested in this asset class. Education – not just for investors, but also focused on advisors – will be the primary solution. Education takes time but should become easier as time passes and ease acceptance among both clients and advisors.  3. CAN advisors allocate to crypto?  Assuming both clients and advisors are interested, there are still some barriers to investing. Many large brokerage firms and asset managers do not allow investment in crypto including crypto ETFs. Vanguard, one of the world’s largest asset managers, has stated on their website that they do not allow crypto ETFs on their platform because they “do not currently believe that there is an appropriate role for them to play in long-term portfolios.” Similarly, Edward Jones released guidance stating that “cryptocurrencies are highly speculative and [they] don’t offer a way to purchase or hold cryptocurrencies” including crypto funds. While Morgan Stanley recently started allowing their financial advisors to offer bitcoin ETFs, there is a significant caveat. They can only offer the two largest funds – Blackrock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC – and these can only be offered to clients with a net worth of at least $1.5 million with aggressive risk tolerance.  These are likely the most difficult barriers to overcome because they can’t simply be solved by education, but persistent investor and advisor demand should reduce these barriers over time.  Bottom Line: Crypto ETFs have come a long way, and I still believe the industry has room to move forward. But we need to address education to encourage adoption and bridge the gap between advisors and their clients.  - Roxanna Islam, CFA, CAIA, Head of Sector & Industry Research, TMX VettaFi  Ask an Expert  Q. Can advisors help their clients with crypto investments?  It can be challenging for financial advisors to meet the needs of clients when it comes to investing in digital assets. The landscape of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology is rapidly evolving, and the learning curve for traditional advisors is steep. From understanding the complexities of the crypto market to managing the risks associated with digital assets, the journey can be overwhelming. Many advisors may not even have the capability to invest in a bitcoin ETF, let alone feel comfortable discussing it with clients. As a result, clients often find themselves navigating the crypto market alone, without the guidance of their trusted financial advisor.  Q. How does it impact clients who don’t have advisors help?  This disconnect can lead to significant problems for investors. Without proper guidance, clients may invest in the wrong asset at the wrong time, resulting in substantial losses. Improper portfolio weighting toward cryptocurrencies can also expose investors to unnecessary risk, while the potential for fraud in the crypto space remains a constant threat. These pitfalls can create a sense of distrust and uncertainty around digital assets, causing many to wonder whether they should avoid the space altogether.  Q. What’s the risk to not learning about crypto?  So, as it stands, advisors are not meeting client needs. This will leave clients under-allocated at a time when the asset is still experiencing outperformance relative to traditional assets. The opportunity cost of forgoing significant alpha could significantly impair client performance over the long run. It is crucial for advisors to realize the time is now to position their clients for future success. It’s time for advisors to educate themselves on this asset class and pass on what they learn to clients. Remember, as an advisor, a diversified portfolio does not need a significant allocation to crypto. A 5-10% allocation to bitcoin can go a long way. We are not there yet, but hopefully, the tide is turning.  - Bryan Courchesne, CEO, DAIM  Keep Reading     SWIFT announced plans to integrate cryptocurrencies and digital assets into its payment network.

The Golden Cross pattern is a major bullish formation on a chart that usually precedes a notable rally for digital assets such as DOGE. Currently, the Dogecoin price is forming its first golden cross in four years, making this an important development for the meme coin’s price. Dogecoin Analyst Points out Golden Cross Dogecoin analyst Kevin Capital on X (formerly Twitter) has highlighted an important formation on the Dogecoin chart. According to the crypto analyst, the movement of the DOGE price over the last few months has been pushing it toward the formation of a Golden Cross. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin All-Time High Only A Month Away After Breaking $60,000 Now, a Golden Cross pattern is usually formed when a short-term moving average such as the 50-day moving average and a long-term moving average such as the 200-day moving average crosses. It usually happens that the short-term moving average crosses the long-term moving average from below. Presently, the short-term MA and the long-term MA are yet to cross, but the Golden Cross formation looks to be in the works. In the post, Kevin explains that the Golden Cross formation may happen in the next few weeks. Once this happens, it could signal the start of a bullish recovery, and according to Kevin, it would be the first Golden Cross in four years. DOGE Price Could Touch $3.8 The completion of the Golden Cross pattern could be the catalyst that sets the Dogecoin price on a path to a new all-time high. The first target for the Dogecoin price with this formation is $0.93. This would be an almost 1,000% increase from the current level, just around $0.1. Related Reading: Ethereum In 2021 Vs. 2024: Fractal Suggests Major Breakout In Q4 It doesn’t end there, however, as the crypto analyst believes that there is a possibility that the Dogecoin price will go higher than this. In what he calls a “Huge out performance,” he says that the DOGE price could cross $2.2 if this happens. This would be an over 2,000% increase. The third and final target for the Dogecoin price with the Golden Cross formation is $3.8. The analyst explains, though, that it would take an “astronomical performance” for this to happen. Nevertheless, this would mean an over 3,700% increase from here. However, the crypto analyst explains that the Dogecoin price reaching these levels depends on “how this economic liquidity cycle pans out.” The current Dogecoin all-time high is $0.73, which means an 800% increase from here will solidify a new high.

An investigation into the theft has led to two arrests, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Thursday.  More than $9 million of the stolen funds have been frozen, according to ZachXBT.  Two people have been arrested following an investigation into a $243 million heist in which the accused thieves allegedly sought to pass thousands of bitcoin through mixing services, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a Thursday statement.  On Aug. 19, a creditor of defunct trading firm Genesis fell victim to a sophisticated social engineering scam after being contacted by a spoofed number that posed as a member of Google support, according to information first reported by blockchain sleuth ZachXBT.  The victim was convinced to reset their Gemini two-factor authentication settings and send funds to a compromised wallet. Transaction tracing analyzed by ZachXBT shows that the $243 million was split across multiple wallets before being sent to more than 15 exchanges.  An unsealed indictment on Thursday identified Malone Lam, 20, a citizen of Singapore who lives in Miami and Los Angeles, and Jeandiel Serrano, 21, of Los Angeles, showing both had been arrested Wednesday night and charged with conspiring to steal and launder the cryptocurrency. They were set to appear in separate federal courts in California and Florida on Thursday, according to the Justice Department.  A cluster of the stolen funds allegedly flowed into luxury goods brokers to purchase cars, watches, jewelry and designer clothes. The culprits were tied to the loot after they accidentally shared an address that has been used to purchase luxury clothing. CFInvestigators, zeroshadow, ZachXBT and Binance Security used this information to freeze more than $9 million, with $500,000 being returned to the victim.

42390363,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bcUwOz,1726751465,"Inside OKX's Strategic Shifts to Its Regulatory Approach, Formula 1 Branding and App Design","Singapore – Crypto exchange OKX has taken a turn of sorts over the past few months. It is rethinking its strategy in three major areas; the look and tech aspects of its application, its approach toward regulation and expansion, and its brand strategy as the primary partner of McLaren Formula 1 Team, OKX CMO Haider Rafique told CoinDesk in an interview.  Rafique revealed the behind the scenes action at OKX in the past year at the unveiling of a limited-edition livery design on the McLaren MCL38 F1 race cars as Singapore gears up for its Grand Prix this weekend.  The race stands out in the F1 calendar as it indirectly acts as an advertisement for the region. The fastest cars in the world zip past buildings hosting financial institutions, such as DBS and Standard Chartered, both of whom are involved in the crypto ecosystem.  The design, titled Legend Reborn, celebrated the iconic MP4 era of McLaren, from 1981 to 1996, honoring its legends Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost and Niki Lauda.  ""When we shopped McLaren, they were team number eight on the grid. A lot of people asked the obvious question, was that the right move? Now leading the 2024 Constructors Standings,"" said Rafique. McLaren last won the constructors' championship, one of the two world championships contested in Formula 1, in 1998. This year, currently, it is in the lead.  ""People go there to watch the sport, not to look at a crypto commercial,"" Rafique said. ""We should be a brand less about pushing our logo and services and more about helping people get into F1. That's the better way to win hearts and minds and have better recall on our logo exposure.""  In terms of the app design Haider said while we had ""rebranded two years ago, we hadn't done our product justice as the design was quite behind.""  Predicting that OKX would be ""one of the largest web three technology companies,"" Haider said the company had been quietly working to redesign the look on its app, bringing in new tech aspects making its Web3 and trading experience from the ""very black and white brand visually"" to appear as a ""deep technology brand.""  Haider also revealed OKX's shift in its thinking toward regulation by narrowing its focus.  ""We find ourselves in a really unique place. We have been largely known as an offshore exchange, in terms of market perception given where we started, where we have largest market share. But the facts are that now, actually, if you look at the last 12 to 15 months of our company history, we are now becoming more onshore than perhaps any global exchange our size,"" Haider said.  While OKX did pull out of India after planning to enter the region, it has secured regulatory victories in Australia and Singapore, which in particular took more than four years, part of which was the ""most difficult,"" OKX's CEO revealed earlier. Additionally, OKX has hired teams and is offering their products in Brazil, Argentina, Netherlands and Turkey.  Plans are afoot for more regulatory victories where efforts had been made for years, Haider said  ""The decision was to put all our energy in making sure we get the licenses where we invested the most in, otherwise it's just millions of dollars wasted.""

The company has a strong financial position with zero debt, a $104.1 million cash buffer, and plans for significant hash rate expansion. TeraWulf's low-cost energy infrastructure supports diversification into high-performance computing (HPC) and AI, promising robust growth and reduced earnings volatility. With a forward EV/EBITDA of 9.7 and a bullish outlook, TeraWulf offers a 30%-50% upside potential over the next 24 months. Investment Overview It’s been a reasonably good year for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) with the digital asset trading above $60,000 with returns of 36% for year-to-date. The same is not the case with most Bitcoin miners. With the halving event translating difficulty in Bitcoin mining, cost escalation has negatively impacted mining stocks. As an example, Riot Platforms (RIOT) stock has plunged by 54% for year-to-date. Similarly, MARA Holdings (MARA) has declined by 32% for the same period. There are multiple other examples of Bitcoin mining stocks underperforming during the year. Among the few exceptions, TeraWulf (WULF) deserves mention and consideration for exposure. WULF stock has trended higher by 70% for year-to-date. Even after a significant rally, I remain bullish on the stock and I initiate coverage with a “Buy” rating. I believe that TeraWulf is positioned to survive, steady increase its hash rate capacity, and create value through diversification. This initiating coverage discusses these factors to elaborate on the bull thesis. It’s worth mentioning at the onset that aggressive rate cuts might be on the cards in the next 12 to 18 months. Expansionary policies would imply a relatively weaker dollar and would be positive for Bitcoin. After trading largely sideways in the last six months, the cryptocurrency might be poised for a breakout. This will support upside in TeraWulf stock as EBITDA margin expansion is likely. Low-Cost Bitcoin Miner With the Bitcoin halving event in April 2024, the cost to mine one Bitcoin has increased. Therefore, the starting point of the bull thesis is the mining cost for TeraWulf. This explains (to a large extent), the reasons for TeraWulf stock trending higher. For Q1 2024, TeraWulf mined 1,051 Bitcoin and the total cost of mining one digital asset was $29,647. For Q2 2024, the number of Bitcoin mined declined to 699. At the same time, the total cost to mine one Bitcoin increased to $41,587. The halving and an increase in network difficulty explain this trend, even after an increase in hash rate. Having said that, TeraWulf has guided for Bitcoin mining cost of $40,000 for the remainder of 2024. It’s still attractive considering the point that the digital asset is likely to trend higher in the coming quarters. Even if we look at things on a relative basis, TeraWulf is better than peers. For Q2 2024, the company reported adjusted EBITDA of $19.5 million and the EBITDA margin was 54.7% considering revenue of $35.6 million. For the same period, Riot Platforms and MARA Holdings reported an adjusted EBITDA loss. Bitfarms (BITF) reported positive adjusted EBITDA , but the margin was 28%. TeraWulf is therefore superior to peers, and it’s therefore not surprising that the stock is trending higher. Steady Mining Expansion Plans TeraWulf ended Q2 2024 with an operational hash rate of 8.8EH/s, which was higher by 80% on a year-on-year basis. The company intends to continue increasing its capacity, with a target of 13.3EH/s by the second half of 2024. Further expansion is planned in 2025. This will translate into healthy revenue and EBITDA growth if Bitcoin remains in an uptrend. To arrive at ballpark EBITDA estimates, let’s consider the chart below that gives the EBITDA/EH for TeraWulf and peers for Q2 2024. A key positive is that TeraWulf is ahead of peers, and this further underscores the view that the company is among the best low-cost miners. Investor Presentation August 2024 Additionally, Bitcoin averaged around $65,000 for Q2 2024. Assuming an average price of Bitcoin that’s 20% higher in 2025 is a good base-case scenario. It would imply that Bitcoin trades at an average price of $78,000 next year. Further, assuming that all other costs are equal, the EBITDA/EH for 2025 can be estimated at $2.9. By the end of the year, TeraWulf is likely to have a hash rate capacity of 13.3EH/s. If I assume the same as an average capacity for 2025, it would be conservative. However, let’s take a conservative estimate for potential EBITDA for 2025. With EBITDA/EH at $2.9 and an average capacity of 13.3EH/s, the average quarterly EBITDA is expected at $38.6 million. This would imply an annual EBITDA potential of $155 million. As a bear-case scenario, I am assuming that EBITDA/EH remains steady at $2.4. Even this would imply an EBITDA potential of $128 million for 2025. Further, if Bitcoin surges above $100,000 in the coming quarters, the annual EBITDA is likely to be more than $200 million. The point I want to make is that TeraWulf is positioned for healthy revenue and EBITDA growth. With upside in cash flows, the company will have high flexibility to invest in hash rate capacity expansion and diversification. Another positive to note is that the Bitcoin miner repaid $30.2 million in debt in Q2, 2024. Further, in July 2024, the company pursued significant repayment of $75.8 million in debt. With a zero-debt balance sheet and a cash buffer of $104.1 million as of Q2, 2024, TeraWulf has high financial flexibility. An important point to note is that TeraWulf has a “No Hold” strategy for Bitcoin. With the likelihood of the cryptocurrency trending higher in the coming quarters, the company is positioned to benefit. Power Infrastructure Will Support Diversification I believe that the rally in TeraWulf stock for year-to-date has been driven by two factors. First, there is clear visibility for healthy EBITDA margin even after Bitcoin halving. This would potentially imply continued increase in financial flexibility for growth plans. Second, TeraWulf has plans to deploy its low-cost energy infrastructure for high performance computing (HPC) or AI applications. The second factor is likely to be a major catalyst for TeraWulf stock trending higher in the next 24 months. Let’s first talk about the company’s power infrastructure. At the Lake Mariner Facility, the low-cost is primarily due to hydropower, with the site being 35 miles from Niagara Hydro. This facility is 91% zero-carbon power. Further, the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility is directly connected to a nuclear power plant and is 100% zero-carbon power. An obvious advantage is the fact that the green energy is being utilized for Bitcoin mining. At the same time, the region has a significant energy surplus. To put things into perspective, the company has 245MW that’s currently operational and deployed across these two sites. TeraWulf believes that it can increase its capacity by an additional 350MW. Investor Presentation August 2024 This additional capacity can be used for Bitcoin mining or deployment towards HPC/AI. In my view, it’s a good decision to consider diversification. According to David Foley, managing partner at Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, “the artificial intelligence crowd is willing to pay three or four times what Bitcoin miners were paying last year” for electricity. There is a low of business sense in utilizing excess power for HPC or AI. Further, as the data below indicates, having surplus power is a big advantage as there is a potential supply demand mismatch. Company Presentation August 2024 TeraWulf is well positioned to benefit with ownership of low-cost power infrastructure. As the chart below indicates, the company is targeting significant capacity to be energized towards the end of 2025 and beyond. Investor Presentation August 2024 This will set the stage for robust growth in 2026 and potentially in 2027. Therefore, the next few years are likely to be positive for TeraWulf in terms of top-line and EBITDA upside. With a clean balance sheet, there is ample flexibility to invest in business diversification. Risk Factors to the Thesis Execution Risk (Low): Between 2022 and the first half of 2024, TeraWulf has expanded its hash rate from 0.3EH/s to 10.2EH/s. During the same period, the company operationalized 245MW of power infrastructure. The execution has been steady, and I believe that the company is likely to meet its 2025 target. Financial Risk (Low): As of July 2024, TeraWulf has repaid all debt. With a strong balance sheet, the company’s financial risk is low. Further, with the possibility of Bitcoin trending higher, I expect healthy cash flows that’s backed by capacity expansion. Bitcoin Price Volatility Risk (Medium): It’s worth noting that Bitcoin traded at highs of $73,800 in March 2024. There has been a subsequent correction and sideways trade. With the cryptocurrency, there is always a risk of high volatility. However, I believe that this risk is mitigated to some extent by the point that aggressive expansionary monetary policies are likely. This can potentially be a trigger for a renewed rally in the digital asset. Diversification Risk (Low): I believe that the company’s impending diversification towards HPC and AI is likely to yield positive results. Goldman Sachs estimates that data center power demand will grow 160% by 2030. Further, between 2022 and the end of the decade, the highest incremental demand growth will be from data centers. I therefore believe that the diversification is in the right direction and reduce the volatility in earnings for the company. Concluding Views I had estimated earlier that TeraWulf is likely to report a base-case EBITDA of $155 million for 2025. With zero-debt and the company’s estimate of fully utilizing the cash buffer by the end of 2025, the current market capitalization ($1,510 million) can be considered for enterprise value. The forward EV/EBITDA is therefore 9.7. If we look at the sector median , the EV/EBITDA ((FWD)) is 14. Therefore, there is a clear valuation gap with an upside potential of 30% to 50% from current levels considering an investment horizon of 24 months. I believe that the sector median understates the valuation gap for two reasons. First, TeraWulf is a low-cost miner and has a superior EBITDA margin as compared to peers. Second, TeraWulf is diversifying into HPC and that’s likely to reduce the company’s earnings volatility as compared to a pure-play Bitcoin miner. I must add here that consensus estimates for 2026 indicate stellar earnings growth. That’s likely to be on the back of HPC/AI deployment. This will add to the bullish outlook for TeraWulf stock. Seeking Alpha Consensus Estimates I therefore believe that TeraWulf is worth considering for the next 24 months. The stock is likely to remain in an uptrend and can create significant value.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4722055-terawulf-steady-growth-cost-control-and-diversification?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/33757010.jpeg

After a period of consolidation, this jump has raised speculation that the bulls might be returning to drive the price higher. Could this price surge mark the beginning of a major rally, or is it just a temporary spike? All eyes are on the next move. This analysis aims to explore the recent 6% price rebound of Shiba Inu and assess whether this upward movement signals the start of a larger rally. By examining key technical indicators and market trends, we determine if the current momentum can sustain further gains and levels to watch for potential breakouts or pullbacks. Indicators And Trends: Are Bulls Gaining Strength? Recently, SHIB’s price has turned bullish on the 4-hour chart, rebounding from the $0.00001272 support level. The cryptocurrency is trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and is demonstrating strong momentum, with a current focus on moving toward the $0.00002045 level. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals that bulls have been firmly established in the market. The RSI’s signal line has surged past the 50% threshold to around 69%, reflecting increasing positive movement for the cryptocurrency. This upward trend suggests that buying interest is intensifying, and momentum could continue to build, potentially leading to further price gains. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Seen Exploding 1,000%-7,300%: Bold Predictions Signal Massive Growth Meanwhile, on the daily chart, Shiba Inu is still showing upbeat momentum, marked by the formation of bullish candlesticks. This indicates a favorable shift in price action as the cryptocurrency moves towards the 100-day SMA and the $0.00002045 level, with the bullish candlestick patterns suggesting a growing upward strength. Furthermore, if this momentum continues, SHIB could see further advances as it approaches this key resistance level. Finally, on the 1-day chart, a careful examination of the formation of the 1-day RSI reveals that SHIB could sustain its optimistic trend as the indicator’s signal line has risen above 50% and is currently attempting to move towards the 60% threshold. What Could Next Moves Look Like For Shiba Inu As Shiba Inu continues its upward trajectory, several scenarios could unfold. If the cryptocurrency maintains its bullish momentum and breaks through the $0.00002045 resistance level, it could signal the start of a significant rally, potentially pushing toward the next resistance level at $0.00002631. Related Reading: Get Ready For Take-Off!

SHIB was trading at approximately $0.00001415, reflecting a 6.97% gain over the past 24 hours.

33756805,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=643034,1726750806,Solana Investors Maintain Their Focus As They Double Their Mpeppe Bag,"Solana (SOL) has long been regarded as one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies in the market, boasting incredible growth in the past 11 months. However, with the recent emergence of Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new AI-powered gambling memecoin, Solana (SOL) investors are beginning to diversify their portfolios. Despite Solana’s (SOL) success, many of its investors are choosing to double down on Mpeppe (MPEPE) in anticipation of its massive growth potential. Solana’s (SOL) Recent Performance and Concerns Solana (SOL) has recently experienced two consecutive red candles, raising concerns among its holders about the continuation of its bullish trend. The price of Solana (SOL) currently hovers around $131, down by 3% in the past 24 hours. A failure to breach key resistance levels, particularly at $138, has cast doubt on its ability to sustain its impressive 11-month winning streak. With Solana (SOL) nearing critical levels, analysts are forecasting the possibility of a bearish market structure. The potential formation of a “death cross” pattern — a long-term bearish signal where the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) crosses above the 50-day SMA — could mark the end of Solana’s (SOL) uptrend, prompting investors to reconsider their strategies. While short-term recovery is still a possibility, with indicators like the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showing diminished bearish momentum, many Solana (SOL) investors are shifting their attention towards Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a hedge against potential losses. Why Solana (SOL) Investors Are Doubling Their Mpeppe (MPEPE) Holdings Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly gaining a reputation as one of the most exciting new opportunities in the crypto market. As an AI-powered gambling token, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a unique value proposition by combining the appeal of memecoins with real-world utility. Its platform allows users to participate in decentralized gambling, leveraging AI algorithms to provide fair and transparent games without intermediaries. For Solana (SOL) investors, Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) potential for rapid growth is highly attractive. The current market price of Mpeppe (MPEPE) is $0.0021, and its early-stage positioning allows for the possibility of exponential returns. Many investors who have been long-term supporters of Solana (SOL) are now doubling their Mpeppe (MPEPE) bags to capitalize on the token’s growth potential before it hits the next major price level. The Future of Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Solana (SOL) While Solana (SOL) remains a major player in the cryptocurrency market, its recent performance has shown signs of weakness. Investors who once relied solely on Solana (SOL) for their portfolios are now branching out to include Mpeppe (MPEPE) due to its promising potential. Solana (SOL) may still recover from its recent dip, especially if it bounces off the $124 support level. However, even with a short-term recovery on the horizon, many investors are looking to Mpeppe (MPEPE) for long-term gains. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is expected to continue growing in popularity as more investors recognize the benefits of its AI-powered gambling platform. The token’s utility and unique position in the market make it a formidable competitor to other memecoins and decentralized gambling solutions. As Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to gain traction, Solana (SOL) investors who have doubled their holdings stand to benefit significantly. Conclusion Solana (SOL) investors are keeping a close eye on the market as they brace for potential downturns. While Solana (SOL) remains a strong asset, recent price action has prompted many to diversify their portfolios with Mpeppe (MPEPE). With its AI-driven gambling platform and early-stage growth potential, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers an exciting opportunity for investors seeking high returns in the ever-evolving crypto market. As Solana (SOL) faces challenges in maintaining its bullish momentum, Mpeppe (MPEPE) provides a compelling alternative for those looking to double their profits.

42397008,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAZMomv,1726748783,Maximizing Bitcoin per Share: A New Corporate Strategy,"Cathedra Bitcoin pivots from mining to data centers to increase bitcoin holdings per share, responding to industry pressures created by the bitcoin halving and low mining revenue.  Metaplanet focuses on boosting bitcoin holdings per share monthly, resulting in a 587% increase in stock value year-to-date.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} has emerged as a significant treasury asset for public companies, a trend catalyzed by MicroStrategy's (MSTR) decision to incorporate bitcoin into its corporate treasury in August 2020, resulting in an over 800% increase in its stock value. According to BitcoinTreasuries.net, public companies hold approximately 354,316 BTC, about 1.69% of the total bitcoin supply of 21 million.  This move has inspired a following, with several other companies adopting bitcoin to diversify and protect themselves from inflationary pressures. Notable among these are Metaplanet (3350), Semler Scientific (SMLR) and most recently, Cathedra Bitcoin (CBIT).  Cathedra Bitcoin, a publicly traded company on the TSX Venture Exchange in Canada, has made a strategic shift from focusing solely on bitcoin mining to developing and operating data centers. The change comes as the mining industry faces increasing challenges due to the bitcoin halving. The Hashrate index, which tracks bitcoin mining revenue, is at a relatively low 43 (petahash/second) PH/s, with an all-time low of 36 PH/s, causing many public miners to struggle in 2024.  Cathedra's goal is now to maximize bitcoin holdings per share by moving away from mining to create a more sustainable cash flow. This pivot allows the company to continuously acquire more bitcoin, focusing on long-term growth in bitcoin holdings rather than costly operational ventures.  ""Going forward, we will make all capital allocation decisions with the intention of maximizing our shareholders’ per-share bitcoin holdings,"" the company said.  Also active in the bitcoin treasury arena is Metaplanet, led by CEO Simon Gerovich. Similar to Cathedra, Metaplanet is also prioritizing growth in its bitcoin holdings. Gerovich has emphasized the company's goal of boosting its holdings each month, a strategy that has led to significant gains. Year-to-date, Metaplanet's stock value has increased by 587%, reflecting the market's positive response to its strategic approach.  MicroStrategy remains a pioneer and the most significant participant in the bitcoin treasury space. Under Michael Saylor's leadership, the company continues to innovate and expand bitcoin adoption. On Sept. 18, it announced the pricing of a $875 million convertible senior notes offering, upsized from an initial $700 million.  The notes carry a 0.625% interest rate and mature in 2028. The proceeds will be used to redeem $500 million in high-interest 6.125% senior secured notes at a redemption price of 103.063% of the principal amount, reducing the company's interest payments. The remaining funds will be used to buy more bitcoin. The offering also includes an option for initial purchasers to buy up to an additional $135 million in notes.  In a recent 8-K filing, MicroStrategy introduced an innovative concept called ""bitcoin yield,"" which measures the percentage change in the company's bitcoin holdings relative to its assumed diluted shares outstanding, including both Class A and Class B shares. From January 1 to Sept.12 the company's bitcoin yield was 17%, with a quarter-to-date yield of 4.4%.  According to the MSTR-tracker, the bitcoin per share ratio is currently about 0.0012. This metric suggests that long-term shareholders are experiencing accretive value in their bitcoin holdings.

42417209,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTTH4v,1726748435,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Rises Above $62K After Fed Cuts Rate,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,925.79 +5.55%  Bitcoin (BTC): $62,521.19 +4.22%  Ether (ETH): $2,428.37 +5.2%  S&P 500: 5,618.26 -0.29%  Gold: $2,585.66 +1.03%  Nikkei 225: 37,155.33 +2.13%  Top Stories  Bitcoin rose above $62,000, buoyed by the U.S. Federal Reserve's 50 basis-point rate cut on Wednesday. Reductions in borrowing costs are traditionally a bullish indicator for risk assets such as cryptocurrencies, and easing cycles have historically coincided with surges in BTC's price to all-time highs. Bitcoin has added about 4.35% in the last 24 hours while the digital asset market at large has risen over 5%, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20). Leading altcoins ETH and SOL lead the gains, up 5.8% and 7.4%, respectively.  Despite the long-awaited U.S. rate cut appearing to have the desired effect on crypto markets, traders are warning the rally could be short lived. They argue the bigger picture of economic slowdown and geopolitical uncertainty will hold back cryptocurrency price gains. Presto Research noted the mixed reaction across asset classes to the rate cut, which demonstrates that ""growth concerns clearly exist."" Arthur Hayes, CIO of Maelstrom, argued that rate cuts will fuel inflation, which could see markets falter and then ""they're just going to do more of it and they’re going to make the problem even worse.""  Crypto Finance, a subsidiary of Germany's largest stock exchange operator, signed a deal with Commerzbank to offer trading services to the lender's corporate clients just two weeks after reaching a similar agreement with Zürcher Kantonalbank in Switzerland. Commerzbank will provide custody services, the companies said on Thursday. The trading service offered by the Deutsche Boerse unit will be available to clients based in Germany and initially focus on trading in the two largest cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and ether. Commerzbank obtained a crypto custody license in Germany in November 2023, allowing the financial services firm to offer a wide range of services related to digital assets.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin's short-term holder (STH) realized price of $61,998.  The STH realized price reflects the average cost for coins moved within the last 155 days, which are the most likely to be spent.  Over the past six months, bitcoin has struggled to remain above this level. A sustained move above the STH realized price would suggest a more robust continuation of the bull market.

However, open interest has remained largely unchanged since July, suggesting a cautious or steady market sentiment.  A significant uptick in network activity could spell good news for bullish bets on Dogecoin {{DOGE}}, the Shiba Inu-inspired memecoin that’s the largest by market cap in a multibillion-dollar cohort.  Network transactions crossed over 1.93 million transactions in the past week, IntoTheBlock data shows, beating that of other popular tokens such as Shiba Inu (SHIB), floki (FLOKI), pepe (PEPE) and others.  This marks the highest weekly transaction for the cryptocurrency since early July, indicating a resurgence of interest and usage of DOGE. Dogecoin has consistently maintained a higher number of transactions than other memecoins, the data shows.

42417196,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTTGrV,1726746360,Solana-Based Drift Raises $25M to Build 'SuperApp' for DeFi Trading,"Drift raised $25 million in a Series B funding round led by Multicoin Capital.  The decentralized finance platform plans to build an array of financial services tools, including spot and derivatives trading and a predictions market.  Decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Drift raised $25 million in Series B funding to expand its Solana-based exchange.  The round was led by Multicoin Capital, with participation from Blockchain Capital, Folius Ventures, Maelstrom and Primitive, according to a post on X.  Drift wrote on X that it would be the ""first on-chain platform to offer cross-collateral margin accounts across a DeFi product suite, spanning perpetual derivatives markets, spot markets, borrow-lend markets and prediction markets.""  As a decentralized platform, Drift differentiates itself from centralized exchanges in that there is no single entity in control of users' funds. Drift's protocol is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and an associated token, DRIFT, which has risen 2.1% in the last 24 hours to just above $0.71.  Solana is the closest competitor to Ethereum, which remains comfortably the biggest blockchain for DeFi activity.  The funding news was initially reported by Fortune.  Co-founder Cindy Leow told the outlet that she wants Drift to become the ""Robinhood of crypto,"" and that the company intends to double its headcount to 50 within the next year.  Leow said she thinks Solana and not Ethereum – currently the dominant blockchain for DeFi in terms total deposits – will ultimately be the best venue for a platform like Drift, because issuers of tokenized assets will ""look at the chain that has the highest amount of activity, the highest amount of users, and the most seamless integration.""

Despite bullish trends in the metrics, ADA has been unable to gain significant price momentum. At the time of writing, ADA is trading around $0.34, experiencing a slight 4% dip in the past 24 hours, leaving investors wondering whether it’s the right time to buy or wait. Related Reading: Bitcoin On Track For $92,000 ‘Bounce’ In 3 Months, Analyst Predicts Speaking of positive vibes, Cardano received a strong vote of confidence from the crypto community. In a recent survey conducted by Weiss Crypto, ADA won the title for the altcoin with the best technology, receiving over 76% of the votes. This shows that, despite price struggles, the community still believes in Cardano’s long-term potential. Which #altcoin has the best tech? — Weiss Crypto (@WeissCrypto) September 17, 2024 Bullish On-Chain Signals There’s some hope shown for ADA holders based on on-chain data. Coinglass reports that ADA’s Long/Short Ratio reads at 1.0167, meaning traders are feeling pretty bullish. Futures Open Interest has grown by 3% in the last 24 hours and has been up since the beginning of September 2024. These kinds of signals tend to mean traders are keeping their long positions, which can, by extension, set up the environment for price increases. For ADA, CoinCodex predicts a price rise of 16.53% and $0.405879 on October 19, 2024. On paper, these are fairly optimistic projections; however, the market sentiment and technicals overwhelmingly advise caution. Price Struggles To Gather Steam Despite the bullish data on-chain, ADA hasn’t managed to break out of the current range thus far. Even with the optimism indicated by the Long/Short Ratio and growing Futures Open Interest, ADA’s price is stuck at around $0.33. Further stagnation in this sense can be supported by the bearish sentiments presented within the wider crypto market that also impacts its short-term performance. ADA has been unable to break out from its present range even with the optimistic on-chain statistics. The altcoin’s price stays fixed near $0.33 even with the hope shown in the Long/Short Ratio and growing Futures Open Interest. The pessimistic mood of the larger crypto market, which has depressed its short-term performance, can help to explain this stalemate. Market Sentiment Cautiously Neutral The overall market sentiment remains neutral at 49, based on the Fear & Greed Index, which indicates caution. Where ADA’s price is said to rise in the coming weeks, most analysts are still advising one not to buy the asset yet since better bullish signals need to appear in the market first. Related Reading: SUI Climbs 36% Amid Bullish Breakout – Is $1.50 The Next Target? The recent surge in whale activity could also have a role to play—on September 17, these massive crypto hodlers moved 19.5 billion ADA tokens, worth around $6.48 billion, according to IntoTheBlock. Such large movements often signal upcoming price changes, and investors are watching closely. ADA: Community Confidence And Outlook With mixed technical indicators, the community of Cardano is doing just fine. The Weiss Crypto survey that shows ADA outperforming Ethereum and Solana, among others, suggests the technological base of Cardano is solid. Finally, though the on-chain metrics are bullish regarding Cardano, general market conditions are quite dim. Its short-term movement is pretty limited while there is hope in the community that the altcoin will still be able to prove its mettle as it works its way up the altcoin ladder.

Crypto presale token Rollblock (RBLK) looks set to change all that, however, as new registrations recently exceeded 15k. Investors in legacy cryptos Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL) and BNB (BNB) are diversifying into RBLK as an attractive proposition, not only to those who like to play games online, but also like to earn a passive income from said players! Ethereum should be a part of every balanced portfolio Ethereum is the original crypto presale token that went to the moon during the most frenzied bull market in 2017. Ethereum is the decentralized platform that allows developers to easily build projects from DeFi to gaming online, and ETH‘s fully established itself as a result. That said, the Ethereum ETFs haven’t really set the world alight, but due to its brand recognition, Ethereum should be part of everyone’s diversified portfolio. Solana is another developer hotbed Solana is another hotbed of developer activity. Over the last 2 years it’s been the best performing large crypto, and even though SOL has corrected quite heavily in the last few months, Solana is still up massively for those that invested in 2022. It’s clear that Solana investors are taking profits and spreading their gains. While it’s doubtful that Solana will be the leader in this bull cycle, like other major cryptos, it should be part of a balanced portfolio. BNB has performed better than most this year BNB has been one of the standout performers during the bearish summer months. The main currency and powerhouse of the Binance Chain, BNB also boasts one of the most utilized crypto assets in the entire industry. Unlike most other cryptos this year, BNB peaked in June this year, but even since the market turned bearish, BNB has actually performed well, and is level since March. Crypto presale token Rollblock set to disrupt $500B industry Rollblock is set to disrupt the $500B global online gambling industry with its cutting-edge crypto presale. As one of the most exciting new cryptos, Rollblock combines the best of DeFi with online gaming, giving users a unique way to both play games online and earn passive income. By leveraging the strengths of blockchain, Rollblock ensures that all bets and transactions are transparent and immutable. This immediately solves one of the biggest challenges faced by legacy gambling platforms, and the industry is looking over its shoulder. It’s not all about gaming and gambling, however, as Rollblock’s key attraction is its revenue share model, which entitles token holders to a portion of the profits. Rollblock doubles down on its passive income features with a staking mechanism that allows token holders to earn up to 30% APY. Rollblock’s crypto presale has already exceeded expectations, with over $3.5m raised and the price of the token up 160% since the launch. There’s still a long way to go with the presale, however, and analysts’ predictions of up to 880% ROI is quickly becoming a reality. The timing is perfect for Rollblock investors, and even if it only reaches half its potential, it’s a clear steal at these prices.

He also provided a timeline for when this parabolic rally could begin. This comes amid a bullish outlook for the flagship crypto following the Fed rate cuts. Descending Broadening Wedge Could Send Bitcoin To $90,000 In an X post, Jelle mentioned a descending broadening wedge pattern that had formed on Bitcoin’s chart. He claimed that the pattern has a price target of $90,000 and added that he expects the price breakout to this target to begin in October. The analyst also remarked that the fourth quarter of this year should be “fun” for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Ethereum In 2021 Vs. 2024: Fractal Suggests Major Breakout In Q4 Indeed, based on history, Bitcoin could enjoy significant returns throughout October, November, and December of this year. The flagship crypto has recorded positive monthly returns in the fourth quarter of the last two halving years. Moreover, Q4 always yields the highest returns of the year for Bitcoin. Meanwhile, in another X post, Jelle highlighted key price levels that Bitcoin needs to break above to ride to a new all-time high (ATH) and this $90,000 price target. He remarked that claiming $62,000 will be a good start for the flagship crypto and that once the price breaks above $65,000, there will be no stopping the train to a new ATH. Bitcoin’s current ATH stands at $73,000, a price level reached in March earlier this year. However, analysts like Jelle have continued to suggest that it is still way below the crypto’s market peak in this bull run. There is also the possibility of Bitcoin rising above $100,000 in this bull run. Standard Chartered predicts that BTC could reach this price level this year. The bank has also predicted that Bitcoin could rise to as high as $150,000 if Donald Trump wins the election. BTC’s Bull Case Just Got Stronger Jelle also mentioned that Bitcoin’s bull case grew stronger following the Fed rate cuts. The US Federal Reserve announced a 50 basis point (bps) interest rate cut on September 18, a move widely regarded as bullish for the flagship crypto. The crypto analyst mentioned that expansionary policy is on the horizon with looser monetary back in place. Related Reading: Fantom To $2: Here’s What’s Driving The FTM Price Recovery More liquidity is expected to flow into risk assets like Bitcoin, sparking a price surge in the crypto’s price, which has remained stagnant for a while due to low demand. The bulls also look to be back following the rate cuts, which could signal a bullish reversal for BTC. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently revealed that 61.95% of top traders on Binance are going long on the flagship crypto. Before now, there was a bearish sentiment among these traders, as NewsBTC reported that 51.41% of them were shorting Bitcoin. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $61,900, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42397010,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAZMolw,1726739106,Ether Rebounds Off Key Support Signals Long Term Bullishness,"Ether has bounced off its 200-week simple moving average, reinforcing long-term support.  Bitcoin fights to stay above $62K while attempting to break past key resistance levels, including the short-term holder realized price at $61,998.  Ether {{ETH}} rose 2.5% in the past 24 hours, trading at around $2,434. More importantly, the second largest cryptocurrency has found key support at its 200-week simple moving average (SMA) of $2,298.  The 200-week SMA is a widely used tool for gauging long-term momentum. If the price of an asset rises above the marker, it is generally considered to be in an uptrend, and vice versa. The move higher was triggered after the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to cut rates by 50 basis point (bps), setting the current target rate between 4.75% and 5.00%.  Ether has bounced off this support multiple times, including on Aug. 5, when broader markets experienced a selloff triggered by the yen carry trade unwind. This support has held for much of September.  In the meantime, bitcoin {{BTC}} was changing hands at around $62,000 marking the first higher low for the token since its March all-time high, signaling constructive price action. Traders expect the rally to be short lived.  To push further into bullish territory, bitcoin will need to break through the $65,000 resistance level, to mark a higher high and continue the upward momentum.  Bitcoin is also attempting to reclaim the short-term holder (STH) realized price of $61,998. The realized price represents the average on-chain acquisition cost for the entire supply, while the STH realized price reflects the average cost for coins moved within the last 155 days, which are the most likely to be spent.  Over the past six months, bitcoin has struggled to remain above this level. A sustained move above the STH realized price would suggest a more robust continuation of the bull market.  Looking ahead, macroeconomic factors could further influence both bitcoin and ether’s prices. On September 20, Japan is set to release inflation data, with expectations for both headline and core inflation to come in slightly hotter year-over-year, according to Trading Economics.  Additionally, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will announce its interest rate decision, with markets expecting a pause at 0.25%. These events could add volatility to crypto markets, particularly as global monetary policy continues to influence investor sentiment across risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  While a weak Japanese Yen would be bullish for bitcoin, a strong Japanese Yen would be bearish for bitcoin. While, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also cut its base rate by 50 bps to 5.25% on September 19, mirroring the Fed's interest rate cut. Hong Kong’s monetary policy tends to mirror the U.S. as the local currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar.  Bitcoin ETFs experienced their first outflow since September 11, with a total outflow of $52.7 million, according to data from Farside. The outflows were from Ark's ARKB ($43.4 million), Grayscale's GBTC ($8.1 million), and Bitwise's BITB ($3.9 million). Total inflows into bitcoin ETFs now stand at $17.4 billion.  As bitcoin and ethereum grapple with key technical levels, broader macroeconomic conditions, particularly in Japan and the U.S., may play a significant role in shaping price movements in the coming days.

33750352,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=642863,1726734633,Will Bitcoin Bullish Swing Continue? Top Analyst Says Yes,"An analyst has explained how Bitcoin will likely continue the latest bullish swing, at least in the short-term. Bitcoin Spot Exchange Supply Has Been On The Decline Recently In a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo has discussed the short-term and medium-term trajectories that BTC could follow. For the former, the analyst says the bullish trend would continue, with “likely 1 week left in play.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Miners In Accumulation Mode, But Is This Really Bullish? In the medium term, things appear to be more complicated, as Woo has pointed out the trend forming in the Bitcoin inventory sitting on centralized exchange platforms. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trajectory in the value of this metric over the last few years. As is visible in the above graph, the Spot Bitcoin exchange supply (the blue line) has declined recently, suggesting that investors have been withdrawing their coins into self-custodial wallets. Generally, one of the main reasons investors keep their coins on spot platforms is for selling purposes, so the Spot BTC inventory can be viewed as an estimation of the available sell supply for the cryptocurrency. As such, the investors taking their coins out of this supply can naturally be a bullish sign for Bitcoin. In today’s era, however, the Spot BTC isn’t the only factor affecting the asset’s price, as another form of exchange supply has gained popularity in the last few years: Paper BTC. Paper BTC refers to the derivatives contracts related to the cryptocurrency that don’t require users to own any tokens themselves. With Paper BTC gaining more dominance, its influence on the market has become quite apparent. In the chart, the purple line corresponds to the total BTC exchange inventory; that is, it shows the sum of the Spot and Paper BTC present on the various platforms. It would appear that while the Spot BTC itself has declined recently, the same hasn’t been true for the combined Spot and Paper BTC supply, which has continued to move sideways. This would imply that Paper BTC is being printed at about the same rate as Spot BTC, which the investors are withdrawing. Related Reading: Bitcoin Toughest Time Over: Why Q4 Could Be A Game-Changer A rise in Paper BTC is generally not a good sign for Bitcoin, so it could hinder BTC’s upward push. Woo notes, however, that things could change quickly if a short squeeze occurs in the market. A “squeeze” refers to an event where a mass amount of liquidations occurs at once, so a short squeeze in particular, would naturally be the occurrence of a mass amount of short liquidations. “Current demand and supply is neutral bearish, but signs of moving into a bullish structure if we get some liquidations,” says the analyst. BTC Price Bitcoin had recovered beyond the $61,000 mark yesterday, but it appears to have slipped up today as its price is now floating around $59,600.

The hacker still holds over $50 million in tokens.  Amid an ongoing restructuring, WazirX founder Nischal Shetty has previously blamed both custodian Liminal and Binance for the situation. However, both parties have denied these claims, highlighting WazirX's attempt to deflect responsibility for losing user funds.  Stolen funds from beleaguered Indian crypto exchange WazirX are on the move as executives continue to shift blame amid an ongoing restructuring in Singapore.  Hackers behind the WazirX’s $230 million hack from July, moved a tranche of 5,000 ether {{ETH}} early Thursday to privacy service Tornado Cash. They have moved 15,000 ether in batches of 5,000 since Monday night, data tracked by on-chain tool Arkham shows.  As of Thursday morning, the hacker’s wallet still hold over $50 million worth of tokens, majorly ether.  Tornado Cash allows crypto users to exchange tokens while masking wallet addresses on various blockchains. The service, by itself, is not nefarious but is commonly used by crypto criminals to clean an online trail that could lead to the identity of those moving stolen funds.  In July, WazirX was hit by a security breach in one of its multisig wallets, causing over $100 million in shiba inu (SHIB) and $52 million in ether, among other assets, to be drained from the exchange.  The stolen funds accounted for over 45% of the total reserves cited by the exchange in a June 2024 report – and the exchange has since filed for a restructuring process to clear liabilities.  WazirX founder Nischal Shetty shifted blame several times during the restructuring period. They first said the hack was possible due to a mistake on custodian Liminal’s end, a claim that Liminal rejected.  In late August, Shetty claimed crypto exchange Binance held majority of the funds belonging to WazirX parent Zettai Labs, restricting the former’s ability to repay affected customers from its books.  But Binance squashed the claims in a blog post earlier this week.  “The WazirX team and Nischal Shetty continue to mislead WazirX customers and the market regarding the relationship between WazirX and Binance,” it wrote in a statement. “Binance has not owned, controlled, or operated WazirX at any time, including before, during, or after the July 2024 attack.”  “Their attempts to shift responsibility is a disappointing deflection tactic, but it should not distract anyone from the glaring issue to be addressed here: the need for the WazirX team to be held accountable for user funds lost under their management,” Binance added.",NEGATIVE,ETH | SHIB,ETH | EXCHANGE | SHIB | BNB | ARKM,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/09/19/wazirx-hacker-moves-32m-stolen-ether-in-four-days-to-tornado-cash-as-binance-denies-founders-claims,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54e8ed67e5250d4d86c3802c9e51b325d9c11b8b-2000x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417205,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTTH1p,1726732003,"Stablecoins Are Becoming Systemically Important, Bernstein Says","Stablecoins are becoming increasingly important to the global financial system, the report said.  Bernstein noted that stablecoins are the 18th-largest holders of U.S. government debt.  Stablecoin circulation is back to an all-time high of $170 billion, the broker said.  Stablecoins are becoming more important to the global financial system, and constitute the 18th-largest holders of U.S. Treasuries, broker Bernstein said in a research report on Thursday.  A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to hold a steady value and is usually pegged to the U.S. dollar, though some other currencies and assets such as gold are also used.  After a dip in supply in 2023, stablecoin circulation is now back to an all-time high of $170 billion, the report said, and monthly payments volume on-chain has tripled in the last 12 months to $1.4 trillion in July.  ""Stablecoins provide USD savings access to international users, propagating digital dollars beyond the U.S.,"" analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.  These cryptocurrencies are seeing increased integration with payments and fintech companies, such as PayPal (PYPL), MercadoLibre (MELI) and Grab (GRAB), the report noted.  Stablecoins are also increasingly being used for cross-border payments. ""USD stablecoins on crypto rails are now the cheapest cross-border payments rails,"" Bernstein said, adding that you can transfer $1,000 on layer 2s for as little as 1 cent.  A layer-1 blockchain is the base layer, or the underlying infrastructure of a blockchain. Layer 2s are separate blockchains, built on layer 1s, that improve scaling and speed.  Stablecoin holders outside the U.S. use these cryptos as a store of value versus their local currency, Bernstein said, and younger people use them more, with 20% of 18-24 year olds in emerging markets holding 25%-50% of their portfolios in this type of digital asset.

News that Flappy Bird was being rebooted as a GameFi title caused its creator to come out of social media retirement to criticize the effort and GameFi.  The announcement that the 2013 mobile game Flappy Bird is making a comeback over a decade later as a GameFi title on Telegram was met with such a negative backlash from the gaming community so much so that it caused the game's creator, Dong Nguyen, to break a seven-year vow of social media silence to distance himself from the effort.  But the Foundation that's spearheading the effort doesn't think this sort of characterization as GameFi grifters is fair.  The Flappy Bird Foundation is a team of passionate fans of the Flappy Bird game published in 2013. ""After the game was pulled from stores in 2014, like many others, we found ourselves unable to stop thinking about the game,"" the group said in an emailed statement.  The Flappy Bird trademark was abandoned following the game's takedown, and the Foundation filed for its revival, they explained.  In 2018, a firm called Mobile Media Partners secured the trademark, which was later acquired by Gametech Holdings, LLC, in 2021, from whom the Foundation acquired it from in August 2024.  The foundation said its role is to be ""the steward of the Flappy Bird IP and ecosystem.""  It also says it has brought on Kek, the developer of Piou Piou vs Cactus, a game which is believed Flappy Bird is based on given the similarities between the two as a developer while also securing the rights to this game.  ""I love that through the Flappy Bird Foundation we are able to breathe new life into the games I built and inspired,"" Kek said in a statement. ""It’s incredible to work alongside such a dedicated team of fans and creators who are truly passionate.""

SIX Group Plans New Bitcoin Trading Venue Bjørn Sibbern, Global Head of Exchanges at SIX Group, highlighted the potential for creating a platform to facilitate trading in spot cryptocurrencies and derivatives, noting that crypto has become a globally recognized asset class. According to the report, the exchange aims to leverage its reputation and Switzerland’s progressive regulatory framework for digital assets to attract large institutional investors. Related Reading: Fantom To $2: Here’s What’s Driving The FTM Price Recovery Despite the growing interest, traditional financial firms have hesitated to establish crypto trading platforms due to concerns about regulatory clarity and reputational risks. While some major firms, including Deutsche Boerse, Nomura, and Standard Chartered, have launched their crypto exchanges, others remain cautious. For example, CBOE Global Markets recently closed its spot crypto venue, citing insufficient regulatory guidance. Similarly, CME Group had considered entering the Bitcoin trading space earlier this year but has since indicated that it has no immediate plans. Switzerland’s Crypto-Friendly Environment According to Sibbern, the recent approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission has sparked renewed interest from retail and institutional investors. Although the Bitcoin price has seen considerable volatility over the past two months – from a high of around $72,000 earlier this year to a current trading price of $59,800 – it is still up 40% year-to-date, underscoring the asset’s appeal to investors and confidence in its continued appreciation despite medium-term challenges. The report further notes that Switzerland has emerged as one of Europe’s most “crypto-friendly jurisdictions,” thanks to its comprehensive laws governing the trading and custody of digital assets. Related Reading: CME Traders Bet Big Against Bitcoin As US Fed Rate Cut Looms Sibbern noted that SIX is actively exploring ways to expand its offerings in Europe, with cryptocurrency trading being a significant consideration. However, he emphasized that any new trading venue would cater exclusively to institutional investors, such as asset managers, rather than retail traders. Sibbern further told the news outlet: We are looking at other ways for us to expand in Europe and as a part of that, we are also looking at [whether] crypto should be a part of it. We see the trend that more and more global banks and institutions are looking at crypto SIX also operates a crypto derivatives platform named AsiaNext in a joint venture with Japan’s SBI Group. Sibbern remarked that they are evaluating whether to replicate this model in Europe. The Swiss exchange, owned by 120 banks, already runs a digital exchange that has listed several digital bonds since 2018, indicating its commitment to integrating digital assets into its operations.

""The Asia-Pacific region is expected to lead global growth in family office wealth, with assets under management in Singapore likely to increase by 10% to $5.41 trillion by 2025.

Our mission is to transform gaming by redefining player acquisition and retention, aiming to reach 3.2 billion gamers worldwide and establish a new profit paradigm for community investors,"" Grooms noted.

In a recent interview with CoinDesk, OKX Singapore’s new CEO, Gracie Lin, whom the exchange recently hired from Grab, talked about the exchange’s journey in getting this license – which it was awarded earlier this month – and what makes the Singapore market unique.  Obtaining a custodial bank account was one of the most important conditions OKX needed to fulfill to transition from in-principle approval to a full license, Lin explained.  ""The most important condition, and in some cases the most difficult, is that the bank has to become comfortable with you: what you bring to the table, your plans, and the controls you have in place,” Lin said. “Fulfilling that requirement was a major step toward obtaining the full license and completing the conversion process.""  One doesn’t have to look back very far to see the need for custodians. Japan was the safest place to be an FTX customer, thanks to rules written in the aftermath of the Mt. Gox and Coincheck hacks requiring the use of independent third-party custodians.  Former Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles said in a recent interview that the collapse of his exchange simply wouldn’t have happened if, at the time, they had modern tools, like custodians, available to them.  Quick KYC  During the interview, Lin also talked about what makes the Singapore market unique.  Within Singapore, OKX is able to use the government’s digital identity system, Singpass, to expedite the know-your-customer process that might take hours or days in other jurisdictions.  For their part, Singapore traders are described as generally passive, Lin said, with a preference for buying and holding their crypto assets rather than actively trading.  Not every token is available on this regulated platform, Lin explained, as they have to be vetted per the regulator's Notice PSN02.  ""We have to provide a legal opinion that the token is not a security, along with our due diligence and risk assessment, which we submit to MAS,” Lin said.  “Initially, we had 21 tokens available. As of September 2nd, we've expanded that to over 50 tokens, and we've submitted additional tokens to MAS. Once they're comfortable, we'll list those as well,"" she continued.

42417212,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTTH93,1726725462,Bitcoin Broke $62K After Fed Rate Cuts. Here’s What Traders Say Will Happen Next,"The Federal Reserve implemented a 50 basis point rate cut, with expectations of further reductions to bring the median benchmark rate to 4.4% by year-end.  Despite the rate cut, market sentiments are mixed with some skepticism about the sustainability of the crypto market rally.  Major cryptocurrencies like Solana's SOL, BNB, XRP, and Cardano's ADA saw gains, with SOL leading at a 6% increase.  Additionally, there's a notable interest in further rate cuts, with market bets on Polymarket indicating expectations of continued monetary easing by the Fed.  A 50 basis point cut by the Fed, and the first bitcoin {{BTC}} buy by a presidential candidate, kept digital assets in the green during the East Asia trading day, even though some market watchers are skeptical if the rally has any sort of legs.  Fed members expect median benchmark rates to come down to 4.4% by year-end, as reported, reflecting some 50 basis points (bps) more cuts in the next two Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings, according to the Fed's quarterly economic projection.  Bitcoin is trading near $62K, up 2.4% in the last 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a measure of the largest digital assets, is up 3.4%.  The broader crypto market moved higher. Solana’s SOL rose 6% to lead gains among majors, with BNB Chain’s BNB, xrp (XRP) and Cardano’s ADA rising as much as 4.5%. Memecoins dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB) rose 4%.  Traders expect rally to be short-lived  In emailed comments, Chris Aruliah, ByBit’s Head of Institution, had a mixed view bout the rate cut’s impact on the crypto market.  “The broader global economic slowdown stipulated by softer economic indicators and geopolitical complexities is tempering investor sentiment,” Aruliah wrote in an emailed statement. “Therefore, while a 0.5% reduction in the Fed’s policy rate may provide a short-term boost to the cryptocurrency market, it is crucial to remain vigilant regarding the potential challenges posed by economic uncertainty and market fluctuations.”  In an interview with CoinDesk TV, Maelstrom’s Arthur Hayes argued that rate cuts as a whole aren’t necessary, and a 50 basis point rate cut would trigger a brief market rally but ultimately reveal deeper issues in the global financial system, leading to more depressed prices.  “At a high level, I think that they should not be raising rates. I believe that the U.S. economy is quite strong. If you've seen the GDP prints over the last eight or nine quarters, it's been consistent growth,” he said during the interview. “Inflation is going to accelerate into the fourth quarter if they decide to continue cutting rates.”  The U.S. government's heavy spending is driving rapid economic growth, which benefits Kamala Harris's election chances, but cutting rates amid high inflation is seen as a mistake, he argued.  “I think that the response is going to be if the markets start to falter, they're just going to do more of it and they’re going to make the problem even worse,” he continued.  In a note, Presto Research wrote that the market remains divided on the implications of the Fed's 50 bps cut, with mixed reactions across asset classes, as concerns over growth and potential recession weigh on investor sentiment.  “Judging by last night’s market confusion, growth concerns clearly exist, and the market needs relief from them to rally. We are now firmly in ‘good news is good news’ territory,” Presto wrote.  More cuts ahead  On Polymarket, traders are confident that the Fed is nowhere close to being done cutting rates.  Bettors are giving a 41% chance of a 100 bps cut by the end of the year (meaning there’s another 50 bps cut in the bag), and a 38% chance of a 125 bps cut.  They are also putting their money on a 65% chance of a 25 bps cut in November and a 26% chance of a 50 bps cut during the same time.  For December, the consensus is that there’s a high chance of a further cut with a 50% chance of a 25 bps decrease, and a 33% chance of a 50 bps cut.  Elsewhere in crypto, Aleo, the native token of the Hashkey-backed privacy-focused zero-knowledge proof layer 1 blockchain is up over 14% after being listed on Coinbase.

Despite this, GDLC's significant Bitcoin and Ethereum weighting, along with its large NAV discount, presents interesting arbitrage opportunities. Value in cryptocurrencies is subjective, and while risks exist, the current discount makes GDLC an attractive play. It's been about six months since I last covered the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund ( GDLC ) for Seeking Alpha. This is a fund that I've written about on this website a handful of times going back the last two years. GDLC: Where's The Diversification? (August 2022) Grayscale Digital Large Cap: A Potential Arbitrage Opportunity (June 2023) Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund: Achievement Unlocked (December 2023) GDLC: Too Cheap To Ignore Again (March 2024) To briefly summarize my view of GDLC, I've generally felt that it's a poorly constructed product based purely on the objective of offering investors diversified exposure to digital assets. However, given the fund's large weighting to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) coupled with the large discount to Net Asset Value, I've felt that GDLC has been an interesting arbitrage play at times over the last two years. I'm covering the fund again now because I feel the fund has once again become too cheap relative to NAV. Fund Details And Holdings Inception: 2/01/2018 Expense Ratio: 2.5% AUM: $475 million GDLC is one of the older crypto funds in the industry. Like most of the other Grayscale funds, the major knock on this product for years has been the exorbitantly high expense ratio of 2.5%. Originally, the fund offered investors exposure to 10 different crypto assets. More recently, that number has rarely been above 5 or 6 coins with large weightings to BTC and ETH. Here's the holdings profile as of 9/17/24: Asset Asset price Holdings per Share Val per Share Adjusted Val % of Fund Bitcoin $59,901 0.00037497 $22.46 $20.44 75.8% Ethereum $2,303 0.00228513 $5.26 $5.21 17.8% Solana ( SOL-USD ) $129.4 0.00878822 $1.14 $0.00 3.8% Ripple ( XRP-USD ) $0.57 1.05774541 $0.61 $0.00 2.0% Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ) $23.26 0.0074882 $0.17 $0.00 0.6% Source: Grayscale, as of 9/17/24 In March, the Ethereum accounted for 22.4% of the fund weighting. With the exception of Ripple, Bitcoin is the only asset in this fund that has seen weighting go up over the last 6 months. As Bitcoin continues to dominate both ETH and the rest of the crypto market, GDLC is quickly becoming a much less diversified product. Which, again, has always been my major critique. NAV Discount & 'Fair Value' Theories When I covered the fund back in March, GDLC shares traded at a 37% discount to net asset value. As of market close 9/17/24, GDLC shares had a NAV of $29.92 per share against a market value of $18.17 - implying a 39% discount to net asset value. GDLC NAV vs Market (Grayscale) 39% is certainly not the largest discount we've ever seen in GLDC shares, but it does perhaps offer a signal about the current sentiment in the market, in my opinion. With the caveat that this discount could certainly go lower, I'd like to make my case for why I don't think it should. To begin, we now have spot Ethereum ETFs approved in the United States. That was not the case when I last covered GDLC in March. Grayscale's Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ) has since converted to a spot ETF as well. Readers familiar with my work here may recall the method I've used for building 'fair value' estimates for GDLC. Typically, I'll adjust the GDLC share value by writing down the small altcoin positions to zero and rerating the BTC and ETH value with the NAV rates from ETHE and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ). ETHE and GBTC are now spot ETFs trading at NAV. So if we utilize that strategy again, we get a drastically different expected value for GDLC: Asset Asset price Holdings/Share $ Val/Share Adjusted Val % of Fund BTC $59,901 0.00037497 $22.46 $22.46 75.8% ETH $2,303 0.00228513 $5.26 $5.26 17.8% SOL $129.4 0.00878822 $1.14 $0.00 3.8% XRP $0.57 1.05774541 $0.61 $0.00 2.0% AVAX $23.26 0.0074882 $0.17 $0.00 0.6% Share Value $29.64 $27.72 Source: Grayscale, author's calculations At $27.72 adjusted per share, GDLC is trading at a 34% discount to 'fair value' if we assume the altcoins are worthless. Frankly, it's difficult for me to accept that BTC and ETH managed by Grayscale could trade at such a large discount in one product while those same assets trade at NAV in much larger AUM Grayscale products. I don't believe a 2.5% fee justifies this discount. But for the sake of argument, let's make another assumption. ETH ETFs have been sort of a colossal failure as net flow into the products has been negative. So even though the dynamic that has impacted that negative net flow has been Grayscale fee flight, let's just make the bold assumption that the market now also has a problem with Ethereum as an investment idea as well. Taking that view, even if we write down the $5.26 worth of ETH in GDLC shares, the Bitcoin alone in GDLC is worth $22.46 per share. Thus, even if one is a 'maxi' who thinks every other cryptocurrency is going to zero, buying GLDC at $18.17 per share with Bitcoin in the $59-60k range is like buying Bitcoin at a 19% discount. I don't think that's a bad opportunity. Insider Moves Related Party Shares Q2-23 1,213,437 Q1-24 1,054,987 Q2-24 1,055,487 YoY -13.0% Source: Grayscale, 10-Qs One detail pertaining to GDLC that has emerged since my last article is a 13% decline in related party shares held since Q2-23. These sales were first seen in the Q1-24 10-Q. Related parties are considered to be directors and certain employees of DCG, Genesis, Grayscale, and Grayscale Securities. As of the latest 10-Q, related parties own 6.7% of the outstanding GDLC shares. There was a small 1,000 share increase from Q1-24 to Q2-24. Additional Risks Value is often very subjective. Such is certainly the case in the realm of cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Just because the market currently values Bitcoin near $60,000, it doesn't mean everyone else has to agree. Where I would argue GDLC is too cheap relative to the assets in the fund, others may argue GDLC is too expensive relative to the intrinsic value of the assets in the fund. Which is to say, there is no guarantee any of this stuff will continue to have a bid. GDLC Daily vs Crypto Fear & Greed (TrendSpider) It's also worth noting that during the depths of ""crypto winter"" in Q4-22, GDLC's NAV discount was greater than 50%. At that time, the crypto fear and greed index was near current fear readings in the high 20s and low 30s. That index was well off the single digit lows from the Terra collapse that May. My view on this is that GDLC's discount rate may be a sentiment indicator that we shouldn't ignore. Taking it one step further and briefly touching on technicals, there is a 50 and 200 DMA 'death cross' looming. Final Thoughts Taking all of this into consideration, I'm still of the view that GDLC is a buy at a 39% discount. To be sure, that discount could get more intense. Furthermore, the discount may foretell danger in the crypto market. But for speculative capital, I still think GDLC is an interesting opportunity. As I showed in the article, you could write down everything but the Bitcoin and still make the case GDLC is underpriced. I wouldn't personally get overexposed to any one investment idea, and that goes doubly for crypto-proxy arbitrage plays like GDLC. Finally, I see no imminent catalyst that turns around the NAV rate. This trade is purely a speculation with no guarantee of success. It's possible the NAV discount shrinks while the fund shares also decline in value if there is significant sell pressure in the crypto market. All that said, I'm long GDLC.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4721986-gdlc-cryptos-deep-value-play?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/33745482.jpeg

33745285,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=642995,1726723099,Dogecoin (DOGE) Eyes Acceleration: Will It Climb Higher?,"Dogecoin started a fresh increase from the $0.0985 support against the US Dollar. DOGE could gain pace if it clears the $0.1085 resistance. DOGE price is eyeing an upside break above $0.1085. The price is trading above the $0.100 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $0.1030 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could rally if it clears the $0.1060 and $0.1085 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Rises Again After a steady decline, Dogecoin price found support near the $0.0985 level. A base was formed, and DOGE started a decent upward move like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move above the $0.1020 and $0.1040 resistance levels. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $0.1030 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. The pair surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1084 swing high to the $0.0985 low. Dogecoin price is now trading above the $0.1040 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.1050 level. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1084 swing high to the $0.0985 low. The next major resistance is near the $0.1060 level. A close above the $0.1060 resistance might send the price toward the $0.1085 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.1150 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.1200. Another Rejection In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.1060 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1030 level and the same trend line. The next major support is near the $0.1020 level. The main support sits at $0.0985. If there is a downside break below the $0.0985 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.0920 level or even $0.0885 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now above the 50 level.

SINGAPORE –– Crypto exchange Bitget has sealed a partnership with La Liga, Spanish football's premier football league, as its official crypto crypto partner, Gracy Chen, Bitget CEO told CoinDesk in an interview on Thursday at the sidelines of the Token2049 conference.  The ""multi-million dollar"" deal may impact the renewal of Bitget's partnership with football superstar and world cup winning captain with Argentina, Lionel Messi, which is ending later this year.  ""We still haven't decided"" how the partnership with Lionel Messi will evolve but the La Liga deal is ""slightly cheaper"" and ""gives us a lot more freedom and more deeper collaborations"" because now we can invite ""some of the star footballers to join our events"" including Kylian Mbappé.  The partnership is limited to Eastern and South East Asia, as well as LATAM regions for two years.  “Over the last decade, digitalization and innovation have been among La Liga's priorities,"" said Javier Tebas, President of La Liga in an announcement. ""Last season, we made this a priority under the umbrella of our New Era, which put the emphasis on technology: we want to be pioneers and we are committed to it,.""  The development comes in the same week that Bitget, along with Web3 investor Foresight Ventures increased their exposure to The Open Network (TON) by $30 million through a deal with a number of unnamed whales of the TON ecosystem.

BTC is currently up 37% year-to-date. Ether's price drifted higher, ending above $2,300. ETH is now down ~0.5% year-to-date. On January 10th, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as GBTC, IBIT, FBTC, ARKB, BITB, BRRR. This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin and ether. While both are considered to be high-risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know . We've also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Bitcoin's price increased to over $60,000 this past week. BTC is currently up ~37% year-to-date. Ether Ether (ETH-USD) is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article with its launch in July 2015. Ether's price drifted higher, ending above $2,300. ETH is now down ~0.5% year-to-date. XRP XRP (XRP-USD), which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We've included it in this article for reference. XRP is currently down ~7% year-to-date. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. Bitcoin tops the chart. In other words, the price of a bitcoin has changed the most out of all three cryptocurrencies. On January 10th, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ( BRRR ).

Ethereum Has Challenges, But None Of Them Are Existential In a recent memo titled ‘A Contrarian Bet on Ethereum’, Hougan highlighted the tumbling ETH/BTC trading pair, indicating the weakening Ethereum price versus Bitcoin (BTC). At press time, the trading pair is exchanging hands at 0.038, its lowest level in three years. Related Reading: Ethereum-Bitcoin Ratio Breaks 0.04 Barrier: Could Altcoins Be At Risk? Compared to some of the other leading digital currencies, ETH hasn’t had an eventful 2024. On a year-to-date basis, Bitcoin is up 38%, while the rival smart contract platform Solana (SOL) is up 31%. Binance’s BNB token has surged by 72% in the same period. However, ETH has remained flat, currently trading at $2,306. Ethereum’s underperformance in terms of token price, according to Hougan, has made it ‘cool to hate Ethereum right now.’ Hougan noted several factors that might risk the Ethereum ecosystem, including the prospect of Democratic US presidential candidate Kamala Harris winning the election and continuing Biden administration’s suspicious attitude toward everything crypto. In addition, the Bitwise CIO acknowledged the threats posed by competing blockchain projects, such as Solana, that offer higher throughput and lower transaction costs. He also admitted that ETH exchange-traded-funds (ETFs) haven’t had as much success as Bitcoin ETFs. Although Hougan acknowledged the success of several Layer-2 solutions such as Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism, he stressed that their success has pulled so much transaction volume from Ethereum that its revenues have crashed to a four-year low. According to Hougan, these reasons are valid but ‘they miss the broader point.’ Hougan stressed that blockchain applications witnessing success in user adoption are all dominated by Ethereum, such as stablecoins and decentralized finance (DeFi). Over 50% of stablecoins are still issued on the ETH blockchain. Similarly, over 60% of DeFi assets are locked in various ETH-powered protocols. Hougan Remains Bullish On ETH In the memo, Hougan mentioned that institutional confidence in Ethereum remains high, as seen in asset manager BlackRock’s decision to develop a tokenized money market on Ethereum this year. Similarly, Nike chose Ethereum to launch its Web 3 gear platform called Swoosh. Related Reading: Time To Convert Bitcoin To Ethereum? ETH/BTC Charts Gears Up For 180% Surge He noted: Ethereum has the most active developers, the most active users, and a market cap that is 5x bigger than its closest competitor. It’s the only programmable blockchain that has a modicum of regulatory support in the U.S., with a booming regulated futures market and a multi-billion-dollar ETF market. To bolster his argument, Hougan compared Ethereum to software juggernaut Microsoft, saying that even though other tech companies like Google, Zoom, and Slack have offered useful services, Microsoft continues to be larger than all of them put together. Concluding, Hougan said that Ethereum’s opportunities are enormous. As the world inches closer to the November US presidential elections, the market participants may reevaluate the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap. At press time, ETH trades at $2,306, commanding a total market cap of $277 billion.

42417200,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTTGtZ,1726717800,Solana Unveils Details of Second Crypto Phone 'Seeker',"SINGAPORE –– Solana Labs's phone designing subsidiary is slated to ship its second crypto phone in 2025, Solana Mobile announced at the Token 2049 conference on Thursday.  Called Seeker, the upcoming handheld will be a major hardware improvement over Solana's first mobile phone, with better battery, a stronger camera and a lighter design than the Saga, said Emmet Hollyer, who runs Solana Labs' phonemaking project.  It will also incorporate improvements specific to crypto. Units will ship with a specialty-built crypto wallet that ties into the device's partitioned Seed Vault key storage. Users of the wallet will be able to execute crypto transactions more seamlessly on Seeker than they could on Saga, Hollyer said.  Seeker represents Solana's second big bet on a product line that at one time was approaching the precipice of failure. Its predecessor Saga was bailed out from piddling sales figures last year when crypto traders realized they could buy units to collect token airdrops worth more than the device itself.  Saga's turabout into a sellout rejuvenated Solana Labs' interest in pushing crypto deeper into mobile devices by creating custom hardware and software. Saga and now Seeker are built on Android-enabled devices that have their own app store for crypto developers in the Solana ecosystem.  Anticipation of the new model has been intense. Solana committed to building a second phone after securing over 100,000 in pre-orders in early 2024. The capital infusion and buyer commitments helped Solana Mobile access better supply chain deals than was possible with the first edition, Hollyer said.  Solana Dapp store  One of the Saga's big appeals as a smartphone alternative to iPhone and off-the-shelf androids was its debut of an independent app store, called the dapp store. Developers could build highly-tailored crypto apps and then launch it through the dapp store without incurring the high fees of Apple's App Store and Google Play.  Seeker's Dapp store improves on its predecessor with better discoverability of different apps, Hollyer said. That variance is possible only because of a surge in interest among builders. While a handful of teams built apps for Solana's first phone, ""tons of teams are reaching out"" for guidance on building for Seeker, according to Hollyer.  ""When we announced this phone and people saw that we had presold 100,000 of them, ecosystem teams have been chomping at the bit.""  The store will also better track toke rewards users are accruing, he said. Hollyer anticipates Seeker will have plenty of payday potential from the many teams planning to issue rewards to owners of the phone.  New capabilities  Seeker will be more permissive about third-party apps gaining access to its ""digital exhaust"" like GPS data, cellular data and compute that device manufacturers usually lock down, said Hollyer.  This comes with tradeoffs. Usually, devices treat this internal intelvery carefully for privacy and other concerns. But all that data is valuable, especially for crypto projects building decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN).  Solana Mobile consulted with user-bootstrapped cellular network Helium and other Solana DePIN teams to figure out what sensor data they might want to harness in Seeker. Otherwise forgettable ""digital exhaust"" data points might help a team better track the growth and performance of their physical infrastructure, for example.  ""We think that those are going to be unbelievable opportunities for our users to earn and engage and interact,"" Hollyer said.",POSITIVE,없음,SOL | TECHNOLOGY | AIRDROP,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/19/solana-unveils-details-of-second-crypto-phone-seeker,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3de355edbd9e6e853de28c65216cfecccfee046a-934x525.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

33741714,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=642869,1726714817,Ethereum Holders Show Mixed Signals: Are The Big Players Losing Interest?,"Ethereum (ETH) holders appear to be adopting varying strategies amid ongoing market uncertainty, latest data from CryptoQuant shows. Particularly, according to a recent analysis by a CryptoQuant analyst under the pseudonym ‘Darkfost,’ a noticeable shift in ETH’s investor behaviour is taking place. So far, larger holders of Ethereum and smaller retail investors are exhibiting signs of inactivity, while mid-sized holders show a measured increase in their holdings. This divergence in strategies among these market participants may provide insight into Ethereum’s market sentiment, especially as it faces a decline in dominance, Darkfost revealed. Related Reading: Ethereum To $4K Again? Analyst Predicts Bull Run As Key Metric Approaches Critical Level Detailing The Holders Divergence Darkfost points out that Ethereum addresses holding more than 100,000 ETH have been largely inactive. This trend is also visible among retail addresses, which typically accumulate smaller amounts of ETH. In contrast, addresses holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH are slowly buying more Ethereum. At the same time, addresses holding between 100 and 1,000 ETH continue to sell off their holdings steadily. This diverse behavior among different investor segments suggests a complex market outlook for Ethereum. The inactivity of large holders, those with balances exceeding 100,000 ETH, is notable, given their potential impact on the market. Usually, large holders include institutional investors, exchanges, and major entities that can significantly influence market trends. Their current reluctance to engage in either buying or selling suggests uncertainty about Ethereum’s near-term prospects. This hesitation might reflect broader market factors, such as the upcoming US Fed rate cuts or the overall performance of the crypto market. Notably, with the US fed rate cut approaching, large Ethereum holders might be sitting on their hands to see how the market will play out before they put their feet back in the market. On the other hand, mid-sized investors, specifically those with 10,000 to 100,000 ETH, are gradually accumulating Ethereum. This slow but steady buying indicates a cautious optimism among this group of investors. These mid-sized holders often represent smaller institutions, crypto funds, or high-net-worth individuals who may be looking to capitalize on potential price gains without significantly impacting the market. Their gradual accumulation could signal a belief in Ethereum’s long-term potential, even if immediate gains appear uncertain.

Over the last seven days alone, the token has soared over 332X, pushing its total market cap over the $341 million mark–a testament to a token that several weeks back was struggling to break the $100 million level. NEIRO Surging After Binance Listing According to trackers, NEIRO is up 109% over the last day, increasing due to rising trading volume. Technically, the underlying momentum is strong whenever a combination of rising prices and engagement occurs. For this reason, some hints suggest that NEIRO has more ground to cover, and early investors should be preparing for even more gains. Related Reading: Here’s What Dogecoin Whales Are Doing Following The Recovery Above $0.1 While the hype around NEIRO is a big factor explaining the uptick in engagement and price, the resulting fear of missing out (FOMO) was initially initiated by the listing on Binance on September 16. According to Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trader count, NEIRO, together with two other meme coins, TURBO and BABYDOGE, started trading on September 16. Yesterday, on September 17, traders began withdrawing the token. Even before listing, the meme coin was one of the top performers, expanding triple digits as excitement built up. Less than 48 hours later, traders are looking to double down, FOMOing on the meme coin, to ride the trend. Trader Makes Millions As Whale Accumulates Out of this sharp leg out, analysts point out that some early traders were heavily rewarded. Arkham data on September 16 shows that one trader, only identified as “0x6ac”, turned a $16,500 investment into over $1.8 million from getting in early before the listing.

Whales and social media influencers are also accumulating the meme coin. On-chain movements reveal that one influencer, @BitCloutCat, has been buying the token after the Binance listing. As of September 17, the influencer was in the money, up over $808,000 in profits. Meanwhile, another whale bought 4.67 billion NEIRO worth over $1.3 million, fanning demand.

33737244,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=642782,1726704003,Ethereum In 2021 Vs. 2024: Fractal Suggests Major Breakout In Q4,"Recent Ethereum price action saw ETH reaching another low of $2,150 on September 6, raising concerns of a more severe drop towards the $2,000 price level. Although these concerns were eased with a subsequent bounce to $2,460 on September 13, Ethereum remains largely in a downtrend, with a triple-bottom price formation now shaping up. Interestingly, this triple bottom formation is not new for Ethereum. As technical analysis points out, the current price action seems to repeat a similar playout in mid-2021. Ethereum Fractal Suggests Rally In Q4 According to a technical analysis by crypto analyst CryptoBullet on social media platform X, Ethereum is shaping up to form a triple bottom price formation on the 1D candlestick time frame. While the third bottom has yet to be fully completed, the analyst draws attention to a similar pattern that unfolded between June and August 2021. Related Reading: Analyst Identifies $0.75 As Most Crucial Target For XRP Price In The Campaign For $1 During those three months, Ethereum’s price fluctuated up and down to create three distinct lows just above the $1,675 mark. After the third low was established, Ethereum experienced a significant bullish rally that propelled it to break through and establish its current all-time high. This upward movement became even more pronounced after a fractal pattern emerged in August 2021, signaling a strong momentum shift. Recent market dynamics have prompted Ethereum to create two bottoms of around $2,150 in August and September. Interestingly, a recent rejection at the $2,450 resistance has seen Ethereum pushing on a decline. This has prompted analyst CryptoBullet to highlight the possibility of a third low in October, thereby completing the triple bottom formation. Price formations in cryptocurrency markets are known to repeat over time, often following patterns that can help traders anticipate future movements. While no two market conditions are exactly the same, studying past price movements provides valuable insights into what may happen in the future. A similar playout of the 2021 price action puts on a similar surge for Ethereum in Q4 2024. Notably, the analyst envisioned a rally towards the $3,700 price level. What’s Next For ETH? At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,320 and continues to exhibit a weak short-term outlook. If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,340 resistance, it could start another decline towards $2,150. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Competitor FLOKI Forms Falling Wedge That Could Trigger 54% Breakout This weak performance and outlook are even more pronounced compared with Bitcoin. As such, Ethereum/Bitcoin is now at its lowest level since April 2021, a staggering 41-month low. Most of this lackluster action has also been exacerbated by selloffs from a few large holders. For instance, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently came under scrutiny for selling $2.2 million worth of Ethereum.
